 ### Chapter 413: Leaving the City and Climbing the Mountain

After the major incident at Cliff Academy, a thorough investigation was inevitable. The trouble all began with Zhao Shuo, who had been invited by the academy’s deputy headmaster to give a lecture. As a result, Mao Xiaodong had a conversation with that deputy headmaster, who hailed from a prominent family of the Great Sui Dynasty. Their discussion ended on a sour note, leading the deputy headmaster to believe that Mao Xiaodong was excluding dissenters and casting aspersions on him. In frustration, he decided to resign, claiming he would stay in his study rather than continue to be subjected to either the academy’s harsh treatment or Mao Xiaodong's machinations against his family. He stormed off, shouting, "Mao Xiaodong, stop spewing nonsense here!"

Mao Xiaodong was quite incensed by that stubborn old fool's attitude, and thus she unleashed her attack dogs, sending Cui Dongshan out to handle things.

Cui Dongshan was delighted and bounced around looking for someone to talk to. Within half an hour, he returned to Mao Xiaodong’s study, brimming with excitement, declaring that there was no issue with the deputy headmaster, nor with Zhao Shuo; it was indeed a case of a senseless disaster. However, Mao Xiaodong felt uneasy, as Cui Dongshan's expression resembled that of a weasel who had just feasted on a plump chicken, prompting her to remind him that this involved the safety of Li Baoping and the others. If Cui Dongshan dared to exploit this for personal gain or resort to any tricks... Before she could finish, Cui Dongshan thumped his chest and vowed to handle matters fairly.

Mao Xiaodong remained skeptical.

Soon after, Cui Dongshan swaggered out of the academy, donning a mask he had just peeled off the face of a Nascent Soul swordsman, along with an unusual illusion technique. He boldly entered a newly established relay station in the capital city of Dali, where envoys from the Great Sui were staying.

Mao Xiaodong hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided not to follow Cui Dongshan down the mountain.

Chen Pingan was still in the process of refining the golden literary spirit, needing just two final rare materials that he had to procure through personal connections.

He also needed to visit the Confucius Temple in the Great Sui capital.

However, before that, he wanted to see the emperor's stance regarding the group involved in the assassination of Cai Feng and Miao Ren. Would the emperor take a harsh approach and imprison them, providing an explanation to Cliff Academy, or would he attempt to downplay the situation? For Mao Xiaodong, the answer was simple: if the Great Sui court was vague and evasive, then since Cliff Academy was already established on Mount Donghua, the academy would continue its teachings. Mao Xiaodong would not use the academy's reputation as leverage against the Ge family of Gao Yang. But he was also not a clay Buddha with no emotions. Under the emperor's very nose, Mao Xiaodong had five assassins encircled and a Nascent Soul swordsman invading the academy to kill—did this capital city have no defenses whatsoever? Did thieves and bandits just come and go as they pleased?

If that was the case, Mao Xiaodong had no qualms about visiting the Confucius Temple and other places of cultural significance to scour them thoroughly. As for whether he would leave a message on the wall saying, "Mao Xiaodong was here," that depended on his mood—after all, it was the Ge family of Gao Yang that had acted shamelessly first.

Cui Dongshan didn’t linger at the relay station for long, quickly returning to the academy.

Chen Pingan was discussing the cultivation of his life’s essence with Mao Xiaodong, particularly how to "borrow" literary fortune from the Great Sui, which required rethinking their strategy. Lin Shouyi had gone to seek advice from the great Confucian Dong Jing on his cultivation dilemmas, while Li Baoping and Li Huai resumed their classes. Pei Qian, pulled along by Li Baoping, was told that the teacher had permitted her to audit the class, and while she expressed her gratitude to Sister Baoping, she internally felt quite burdened.

Zhu Lian continued to wander the academy alone.

Thus, in the courtyard, only Xie Xie and Shi Rou remained.

When Cui Dongshan returned with a broad smile, both Xie Xie and Shi Rou sensed trouble, feeling that calamity was impending.

The fiery sword hidden within Shi Rou’s abdomen had already been extracted by Cui Dongshan using secret techniques. Initially, Shi Rou had felt it was akin to childbirth, extremely distressing, and she suspected Cui Dongshan did it on purpose, though she dared not voice any doubts.

Cui Dongshan kicked off his boots, ascended the steps, and lay down in the corridor, complaining, "Those with talent bear the burdens. Poor you, my dear young master."

Xie Xie and Shi Rou sat nearby, barely daring to breathe.

Cui Dongshan sat up, “Go fetch my two jars of Cloudy Essence and the chessboard.”

Xie Xie’s heart raced, her face paling as she and Shi Rou hurried to bring the chessboard and two blue porcelain jars.

Cui Dongshan opened the jars, picked one up, took a deep breath, and carefully wiped it. Suddenly, his eyes widened as he pinched the piece made from “Dripping Water” during the grand refining process at the Liuli Pavilion in Baidi City, holding it up high. Under the sunlight, it shimmered brilliantly, and as he lightly twisted it between his fingers, a mist of clouds and water vapor swirled around the essence, resembling an actual cloud from Baidi City.

Cui Dongshan turned to Xie Xie.

Xie Xie’s heart sank; did this piece get damaged because of the rough handling by Li Huai and Pei Qian? Cui Dongshan suddenly burst into laughter, “This was well done! It has greatly enhanced my young master’s reputation. Otherwise, judging by how poorly you managed the array this time, I might have been tempted to kick you out! After all this time, where is that so-called genius of the Lu family, rumored to be one in a hundred years? You’re no better than an average so-called genius to me!”

Xie Xie timidly replied, “You don’t blame me for allowing Pei Qian and Li Huai to mishandle the Cloudy Essence?”

Cui Dongshan smacked his forehead, “You really are foolish, aren’t you? Just because a fool has good fortune doesn’t mean it’s your fault!”

If Xie Xie had acted petty, wouldn’t that reflect poorly on Cui Dongshan’s upbringing and teaching? In the end, who would he blame?

Two jars of Cloudy Essence—were they really worth less than a single hair of Li Baoping, Pei Qian, and Li Huai in the young master’s eyes? Cui Dongshan was in high spirits as he casually tossed the Cloudy Essence back into the jar. With a crisp sound, it seemed to trigger some sort of secret technique, and an illusionary scene emerged above the jar, with clouds drifting and the outline of a miniature Baidi City faintly visible. A rainbow hung in the air, and tiny white cranes were seen soaring, each as small as a grain of rice.

Shi Rou was entranced, wondering how many secrets Cui Dongshan was hiding.

For the first time, Cui Dongshan revealed a sincere smile to Xie Xie, saying, “Regardless, you did well in this matter. My young master has always been clear in reward and punishment. Go ahead, ask for whatever reward you wish.”

Xie Xie gazed at the unfamiliar figure of the white-clad devil, feeling a mix of emotions.

Cui Dongshan sighed, standing up and lightly tapping Xie Xie, lecturing, “For great figures, a casual inquiry about their health can make many grateful and forever remember it. Is that really a good thing?”

Xie Xie felt as if she were in an ice cave.

Cui Dongshan walked over to her, and she stood rigidly. He patted her cheek gently—not hard—saying, “It’s alright, compared to before, you’ve made great progress. That’s good enough.”

Cui Dongshan raised his hand, spreading his palm. The exquisite fiery sword slowly spun above his hand, its bright red form radiating vibrant, flickering flames.

Cui Dongshan smiled, “This once ownerless life sword is now yours. Take good care of it. Don’t expect to refine it into your life’s essence; that’s far too difficult. Just nurture it secretly in a certain Qi residence; it can serve as your trump card. When the time comes, even if you’re not a sword cultivator, you’ll have a greater chance of winning in combat. Don’t embarrass your young master. Don’t think that just because Lin Shouyi’s realm is currently low, it’s not because Dong Jing is deliberately suppressing his cultivation. If you don’t pay attention, you’ll soon find him catching up.”

Xie Xie saw that Cui Dongshan was serious, carefully channeling her spiritual energy to control the fiery sword, guiding it to her palm.

A life sword from a Nascent Soul swordsman.

What did that mean? It represented nearly all of a Nascent Soul swordsman’s possessions and lifelong efforts encapsulated in this small object.

If it had to be converted into divine money, it would be worth at least a hundred Gu Yu coins!

Back when the Lu family dynasty was at its peak, what was the total tax revenue of a nation in a year?

Cui Dongshan looked at Xie Xie, tears streaming down her face, her masked countenance a dark and ugly sight.

Cui Dongshan leaped back, shouting, “You’re so ugly and yet crying like this! Are you trying to scare your young master to death?!”

Xie Xie blushed deeply, quickly turning her head to wipe her tears.

Cui Dongshan leaned, beckoning to Shi Rou, “Little sister, come here; we need to talk. You’ve been protecting my young master and, while that doesn’t account for much merit, it’s certainly a bit of hard work. This time, you helped me capture a fiery sword, so I need to reward you.”

Shi Rou was frightened, shaking her head vigorously.

Her instincts told her that going over would lead to a fate worse than death.

Cui Dongshan grinned, suddenly twisting his wrist. Xie Xie’s abdomen burst open with a spray of blood, as he forcefully extracted a Dragon-binding Nail from her acupoint, then reached out to pull Shi Rou in front of him, slapping her forehead and driving the nail into Du Mao’s mind, into the ethereal light of Shi Rou’s soul.

Xie Xie collapsed to the ground, clutching her abdomen. Although the pain was excruciating, it was ultimately a huge blessing; her expression was weak, yet her heart was filled with joy.

Cui Dongshan grasped Shi Rou’s head, looking down at her soul, which was howling in despair yet making no sound. He smiled, “How does it feel?”

As Shi Rou’s soul was pulled, Du Mao’s ethereal form began to tremble violently.

Cui Dongshan stared into Shi Rou’s pleading eyes and softly asked, “Do you need me to tell you what to do?”

Shi Rou’s mind was fading; if Cui Dongshan continued, she might truly lose her soul, and the last flicker of spiritual light—the golden seed of her Dao vein—would likely vanish along with the withering of her “heartland.”

Cui Dongshan snorted coldly, pressing down gently, tossing Shi Rou onto the green bamboo corridor. “If you dare to speak of this, your future will be a thousand times worse.”

Shi Rou’s body convulsed violently on the corridor.

Xie Xie, confused, dared not investigate further.

Cui Dongshan kicked Shi Rou into the main house, then turned to Xie Xie, “Prepare to receive guests.”

Not long after, Li Huai and an aged scholar appeared at the courtyard entrance, followed by a white deer.

It was none other than the great Confucian Zhao Shuo, but this man was genuinely the headmaster of a personal academy, a student of the Goose Lake Academy from the lineage of the Grand Sage of South Posa.

Cui Dongshan stood barefoot on the steps, reveling in Zhao Shuo’s misfortune, “Zhao Shuo, did you not check the fortune before going out? Not only did you get knocked out and stuffed in a sack, but you also lost your prized possession used for boosting your reputation and gaining prestige in the scholarly community.”

Zhao Shuo, with a slightly swollen forehead, smiled, “Gained it by luck, lost it by fate.”

Cui Dongshan feigned surprise, “Oh? You really are willing to give that white deer to Li Huai?”

Zhao Shuo nodded, “Regardless, since someone used me as a stepping stone for their assassination, it is my fault, and I should apologize. Since the white deer has already chosen Li Huai, it wouldn’t be appropriate to keep it.”

Cui Dongshan elongated his tone, “Oh, I’m curious—where did you knock them out and leave them? How did the Great Sui government find you?”

Cui Dongshan was not one to shy away from sensitive topics. Although Zhao Shuo had excellent composure and managed to earn great respect as a private academy headmaster, Cui Dongshan’s probing made him somewhat uneasy.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, “Surviving a great calamity surely brings future blessings; you, Zhao Shuo, are truly fortunate.”

Li Huai, unable to tolerate it any longer, glared, “Cui Dongshan, how can you speak to Master Zhao like that?! You can’t just call him by his name; do you believe I’ll tell Chen Pingan on you?”

Cui Dongshan laughed in anger, “Li Huai, has your conscience been eaten by dogs? Who do you think helped you find this fortune? And who are you closer to? Do you really want to betray me? Do you believe I’ll have Li Baoping expel you?”

Li Huai sneakily shot Cui Dongshan a glance, signaling that he was afraid the old scholar might change his mind and take back the white deer, urging Cui Dongshan to cooperate.

“Then let’s invite Master Zhao for some tea,” Cui Dongshan said as he stepped down the steps. Xie Xie immediately moved to set up the tea on the stone table.

Cui Dongshan glanced at the sky.

Xu Ruo should have met with the mastermind by now.

If the conversation went well, everything would be easy to discuss. If not, the fact that half of the Great Sui capital remained intact would be thanks to the Ge family’s ancestors.

However, whether it went well or not had little to do with Cliff Academy.

Cui Dongshan was no longer Cui Chan.

He desired a piece of pure land, a paradise in his heart.

---

While Cui Dongshan and Master Zhao Shuo were drinking tea.

A tall elder finished discussing matters with someone and approached Master Fan to leave the city together.

Looking at the young Master Fan, the elder asked with a smile, “Did you reach an agreement?”

The elder nodded, “Basically, we reached a consensus, but the private matter was somewhat uncomfortable.”

Master Fan asked curiously, “What do you mean?”

The elder laughed, “Just a messy old account; I wouldn’t want to tarnish Master Fan’s ears with it.”

Master Fan smiled silently.

Cursing?

He had been scolded for so many years, and those who criticized him were either Confucian sages or the various other philosophers; a common person would have long since been overwhelmed by the insults.

The elder likely realized this, and no longer hid it, laughing, “Master Fan, you should know that Xu Ruo has been in close contact with that person, right?”

Master Fan nodded, “I’ve heard of it; Xu Ruo holds that person in high regard.”

The elder laughed heartily, “I just want to say in front of Xu Ruo that Ah Liang isn’t anything special; it’s not as exaggerated as the rumors outside!”

Master Fan asked in confusion, “Why do you say that?”

The elder seemed to recall a boastful achievement worth sharing, filled with spirit and pride, saying, “Back then, we ten set a trap to encircle and kill him, and I was the only one who got away!”

Master Fan was momentarily stunned, helplessly responding, “I have no words to say.”

---

Outside the gate at the foot of Cliff Academy.

Two young individuals, a man and a woman resembling a master and servant, seemed to hesitate about entering.

The man wanted to venture in, wondering if it would be better than Lin Deer Academy in his hometown of Piyun Mountain. The woman was less willing, saying she disliked places like academies even more than schools.

In the end, he had no choice but to climb the mountain alone and entered the academy.

She stayed behind at the entrance.

The gatekeeper of the academy, surnamed Liang, continued to nap with squinted eyes, intentionally ignoring the two from start to finish.

The aura of the dragon was quite heavy.

Surprisingly, it was heavier on the woman.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 414: Refinement**

The young man arrived at the lakeside, where it was evident that the Ge Yang Gao family had poured a considerable amount of effort and resources into this academy. The old site of the Mountain Cliff Academy in Da Li was soon to become the location of the new Wen Miao in the capital of Da Li.

Turning his head, the young man spotted a figure that was both familiar and strange. Strange because the person's appearance, height, and attire had changed significantly. Yet, there was still a sense of familiarity in those eyes. Years had flown by, transforming two neighboring children—one a scandalous illegitimate son of a kiln supervisor, the other a lonely mud-legged boy—into the current Prince Song Mu of Da Li and a well-traveled scholar, wanderer, or swordsman.

Chen Ping'an wasted no time and said directly, “I heard from the Maoshan Lord that you arrived at the academy, so I came to see you.”

Song Jixin looked Chen Ping'an up and down. It was said that he carried a semi-immortal weapon, a sword gifted by the Fu family as an apology. The wine flask at his waist was a token from the purchase of several mountains, a specially selected sword-nurturing gourd from the North Yue’s deity, Wei Bo. With a grin, Song Jixin said, “Back when we were neighbors, we always thought that the folks from Fu Lu Street and Tao Ye Alley were wealthy and powerful. Who would have thought that, looking at it now, it’s us from Ni Ping Alley and Xing Hua Alley who’ve turned out to be more accomplished? Xing Hua Alley relies on that Ma Ku Xuan from Zhen Wu Mountain, while at our Ni Ping Alley, you, me, Zhi Gui, and even that little snot-nosed brat... I wonder if decades later, outsiders will regard our Ni Ping Alley, the place where not even a dog wanted to relieve itself, as a legendary locale?”

Chen Ping'an was about to respond.

Song Jixin waved his hand, “At least let me finish. Otherwise, with your Chen Ping'an’s ability to talk, I fear this rare reunion will end on a sour note.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Then let’s talk while we walk.”

The two strolled side by side along the tranquil path by the lakeside, where willow trees swayed gently.

Song Jixin chuckled, “You’ve been away for so long; you probably don’t know what the town is like now, do you? Ever since the common folks learned about the general origins of Li Zhu Cave Heaven, they’ve opened their doors wide. Whether it’s the wealthy families from Fu Lu Street and Tao Ye Alley or the poorer folks from Qi Long Alley and Xing Hua Alley, every household is rummaging through their belongings, carefully digging out heirlooms and old items. From dining bowls to stone troughs for feeding pigs, from pickling barrels to copper mirrors removed from the walls, they’re treating everything with great importance. But that’s not all—many have started climbing mountains and diving into waters. Especially by the Long Xu River, it’s been overcrowded for nearly half a year, with people scouring for stones. Even the Immortal Tombs and Porcelain Mountains haven’t been spared, all filled with treasure hunters, who then go to Niujiao Mountain’s Bao Fu Zhai to have their finds appraised. Quite a few have struck it rich overnight. What used to be precious silver and gold doesn’t even compare anymore; now it’s all about how many immortal coins one has in their pockets.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “The farmland must be lying fallow, right? A lot of the porcelain kilns in Long Kiln must have stopped operations too?”

Song Jixin nodded, “Of course. Who cares about the harvest now?”

Chen Ping'an sighed. It was human nature. If he, Chen Ping'an, had not gone through those experiences and had remained a regular kiln worker in Ni Ping Alley, he would have been even more diligent in climbing mountains and crossing waters. The only difference would likely be that he wouldn’t forget his duties. If there were farmland, he wouldn’t be able to bear leaving it unattended, and if he were a proper kiln worker, he wouldn’t want to waste his craftsmanship.

Once, when Lu Chen reminded him, as soon as Chen Ping'an heard about the potential for money, he rushed to the Long Xu River that very night, carrying a large basket, searching for those remaining snake gall stones that had yet to lose their vitality. He was practically running headlong, forsaking sleep and food.

However, that time, while Chen Ping'an was frantically picking through the river, nearly scouring it clean, Ma Ku Xuan had simply gone in once and found the most valuable snake gall stone. When he pulled it out of the water, it shone like a bright moon.

Song Jixin stopped in his tracks, “Do you hate me?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not really hate; I just think it’s best to keep my distance from you.”

Song Jixin looked puzzled, “That lady even sent someone to kill you, and you don’t hate me?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Was it you who persuaded her to come kill me?”

Song Jixin self-deprecatingly replied, “I don’t have that kind of ability. The so-called mother-son bond, after I changed my name to Song Mu in the Zongrenfu archives, of course, existed, but there’s a difference in closeness. It’s nothing shocking; I’ve only just realized that matters of the imperial family, while often grand, aren’t so different from our old neighborhood, where a family with several children will always have some favoritism from their parents.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Well, that’s settled then. If I have the opportunity in the future, I’ll seek her out. There’s no need to hate you, Song Jixin.”

Song Jixin was weaving a willow ring, and Chen Ping'an quietly remarked, “She, like the national master Cui Zhan, is one of the most powerful figures in Da Li, but I don’t think that’s all there is to Da Li. Da Li boasts the earliest Mountain Cliff Academy, the bustling prosperity of Hong Zhu Town, the scouts from the Da Li border army who actively urged me to go and safeguard against the cold winds, and even the informants who were willing to take risks to send me messages on behalf of Da Li after she personally established the Green Wave Pavilion. I believe these too are part of the Da Li dynasty.”

Chen Ping'an turned to Song Jixin and continued, “I’m aware of all this. If I still decide to confront her face-to-face and end her in one blow, I’ll do it cleanly. The grievances between the two of us will be settled between just the two of us, without involving the other citizens of Da Li as much as possible.”

Song Jixin chuckled, “She wouldn’t think so.”

Chen Ping'an smiled back, “I already have my reasons; even the Confucian principles wouldn’t find fault. Why should I care what she thinks?”

Song Jixin looked at Chen Ping'an again, “Have you been reading some Legalist texts?”

Chen Ping'an countered, “Did you read any of the books left by Mr. Qi? Some you left in the town, while others you took with you. Did you read the ones you took?”

Song Jixin finished weaving a small ring and slipped it onto his arm, giving it a gentle shake, “Why do you care?”

Chen Ping'an didn’t want to dwell on that, so he asked a question unrelated to their grievances, “What brings you to the Great Sui?”

Song Jixin clasped his hands behind his head, “Years ago, Gao Xuan came to find opportunities in our area, and someone said I was inferior to him, so I thought I’d come here for a stroll.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Can you even compare? You came to Da Sui to show off, while Gao Xuan was actually deep in enemy territory. Besides, now Gao Xuan has gone to the Pi Yun Mountain Lin Mu Academy as a hostage; are you going to follow suit?”

Song Jixin laughed in disbelief, “Chen Ping'an, you’ve improved so much compared to before, you even know how to say some strange things. Did you learn this from me?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Stop flattering yourself.”

Song Jixin squatted down, picked up a stone, and tossed it into the lake, “Can I ask you a favor?”

Chen Ping'an immediately said, “No.”

Song Jixin looked up, feigning distress, “Why not? Chen Ping'an, honestly think about it—except for the time I tricked you into becoming an apprentice at Long Kiln, have I done anything else wrong to you?”

Chen Ping'an said, “You think I’m unpleasant, but I find you quite enjoyable. Why pretend to be friends?”

Song Jixin never expected that to be the answer and burst into laughter, “Chen Ping'an, you’ve changed. You’re much more likable than that rigid wooden person from before. If you had this temper back then, I would have sincerely wanted to be your friend.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Song Jixin, you know very well that we can’t be friends. As long as we don’t become enemies, we should both be satisfied.”

Song Jixin removed the willow ring and tossed it into the lake, then picked up a stone and aimed it at the center of the ring, “The Mountain God Temple of the Fallen Mountain is in a bad situation now. Wei Bo has some issues with the Mountain God up on your mountain. I initially wanted you to say a few words on my behalf to Wei Bo. I’m not hoping for him to support that temple, just hoping he won’t suddenly change the statue inside one day.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated.

The current Mountain God of Fallen Mountain was none other than the former kiln supervisor, Song Yuzhang.

Song Jixin looked at the fading willow ring and softly said, “What you want to say, I already understand. The reason he was cut off by the Lu family's general Wang Yifu and had his head severed, aside from covering up the royal scandal related to that bridge, was also because of the emperor’s selfish motives. After all, who would want their own son to have a ‘cheap old man’ in their heart? Wang Yifu privately told me that before he died, he asked Wang Yifu to pass on a message to me, saying that all those years, he had always wanted me to write a couplet for him. You say, for such a treasonous minister, if he doesn’t die, who will?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, “I was planning on returning to Long Quan County anyway. I’ll bring this up with Wei Bo, but I won’t ask him to do anything. I don’t have the ability to dictate to a North Yue deity. I can clarify this with you right now. In the future, Song Yuzhang will likely stand with your mother. As the Mountain God of Fallen Mountain, if he comes after me, I will absolutely smash the golden statue of Song Yuzhang into dust, leaving no possibility of piecing it back together. No hesitation there.”

Song Jixin laughed, “With this back-and-forth, I don’t feel the need to thank you anymore.”

Chen Ping'an sneered, “I never thought you would thank me in this lifetime.”

Song Jixin exclaimed in surprise, making a series of tsk-tsk sounds as he stood up and clapped his hands, “Chen Ping'an, your demeanor and behavior right now are truly like that of a cultivator from the mountains. You’ve got quite the celestial temperament.”

Chen Ping'an remained unmoved.

Song Jixin asked with a smile, “Having seen you and asked my questions, I’ll be content to head back now. By the way, Zhi Gui is waiting for me at the academy gate down the mountain. Do you want to come with me to see her?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “No need.”

Song Jixin added, “Now that Ma Ku Xuan from Zhen Wu Mountain has broken through after his retreat, breaking through realms is as easy for him as a commoner getting an upset stomach from bad food. He’s been dubbed the second Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple. You say, with him supporting Xing Hua Alley, can we even match the entire Ni Ping Alley in reputation? Doesn’t that make you angry?”

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Song Jixin extended two fingers, bent one, “I was going to tell you two things as a way to repay you for your help regarding the Mountain God Temple of the Fallen Mountain, but now I realize I still don’t like you, so I’ll just say one thing. It seems that our Da Li Song family is showing signs of capsizing in the western mountains of Long Quan County due to the changing situation. Many foreign powers that bought mountain tops and built mansions are getting pessimistic about us, especially some near the central region of Baoping Continent. They are considering selling off their mountains cheaply to avoid being held by someone in the future. There have already been one or two secret deals made, with Ruan Qiong managing to acquire three mountain tops at once, one of which was Niujiao Mountain that Bao Fu Zhai sold. If you hurry back, you might still be able to grab one or two. Now, all you need is a Gu Yu coin.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “When did this happen?”

Song Jixin rolled his eyes, “On the way here, I just heard Xu Ruo mention it. It was probably about ten days ago. Before that, who would have been willing to part with their mountains? Everyone was eager to move their entire mountain gates to Long Quan County. It’s said that the Pi Yun Mountain where Wei Bo is has been bustling with activity these past few years, all sorts of sycophants around. Thankfully, Wei Bo is accommodating and smiles at everyone, but if it were me, I would have been sick to my stomach.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’ll give it a try.”

Song Jixin laughed, “No need to see me off.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Then I won’t see you off.”

Song Jixin laughed heartily, “That hasn’t changed; you’re still as dull as ever.”

As Song Jixin left the lakeside, he walked toward the foot of the mountain.

Chen Ping'an stood there, watching him depart slowly.

When Song Jixin reached the academy gate, he smiled at Zhi Gui, “I’m leaving.”

Zhi Gui asked, “Is the young master in a good mood?”

Song Jixin replied cheerfully, “I met Chen Ping'an, who’s doing quite well, so I’m particularly happy.”

Zhi Gui responded with an “oh.”

Song Jixin glanced back at the Mountain Cliff Academy, curious, “Aren’t you going to take a look? If you want, the young master can accompany you for another trip.”

Zhi Gui shook her head, “Not interested.”

Song Jixin sighed, “Do you think the two national masters will stand by my brother’s side?”

Zhi Gui giggled, “Young master, you’ve asked me that many times already.”

Song Jixin helplessly said, “It’s just that I’m unsure. My uncle refuses to share his thoughts, and the two national masters are so inscrutable. The young master has no foundation in the capital; compared to Chen Ping'an back in Ni Ping Alley, I’m even more in the clear. At least he has an ancestral home, but I have nothing. Among civil and military officials, mountain dwellers and townsfolk, aside from a few who believe in gambling big wins, who would truly look kindly upon you, young master?”

Zhi Gui comforted him, “You still have me by your side.”

Song Jixin laughed, raising his arm high, palm facing up toward the sky, “The young master is just a puppet; they can play with me however they like. If Chen Ping'an can have today, why can’t I have tomorrow?”

Zhi Gui, still dressed in the attire of a maid, appeared slightly more affluent than back in Ni Ping Alley. Her figure had become more striking, and she smiled, “Comparing yourself to him seems a bit… embarrassing?”

Song Jixin retracted his hand, fist-bumping his palm, then turned to praise, “That comforting remark was well-received!”

———

In the capital of Da Sui, just before the grand banquet was about to be held, the atmosphere had grown quite strange and unpredictable.

Cai Feng had already taken leave from the Astronomical Bureau, yet his presence was nowhere to be found at the Cai family estate.

The newly minted top scholar, Zhang Dai, had not been seen in the esteemed Hanlin Academy, a place for nurturing potential candidates for the prime minister's position, for quite some time.

It was said that Song Shan, the deputy commander of the Military Affairs Office, even visited the Ministry of Justice.

Rumors were flying rampant in the official circles and among the common folk in the capital.

The nominal head of the Mountain Cliff Academy, the Minister of Rites of Da Sui, visited the academy late one night and had a private meeting with the deputy head, Mao Xiaodong. The meeting was held not in the study but in the Confucius Hall, which honored the three Confucian saints.

In the latter half of that night, Mao Xiaodong did not explain the details to Chen Ping'an; he simply called him to leave the academy and went to the Da Sui Wen Miao. Compared to the first time he made a large request, this time, Mao Xiaodong brought back more ceremonial vessels and offerings that carried the weight of literature.

Upon returning to Donghua Mountain, Mao Xiaodong took Chen Ping'an to the mountain peak and revealed a jade tablet, taking on the dignified demeanor of a sage presiding over the academy.

Chen Ping'an took out more than thirty pieces of rare materials that Mao Xiaodong had helped prepare. The last two, which had arrived late, were a millennium-old water buffalo horn and a weapon of a martial sage from the capital of a certain country in the central region of Baoping Continent, exuding a rich atmosphere of battle.

Regarding the collection of refining materials, Mao Xiaodong had never pretended to be aloof; from the very beginning, he explained the origins, prices, and unique features of these rare materials to Chen Ping'an.

Since it was the first time refining the Water Word Seal in Old Dragon City, with Fan Junmao assisting, only then did Chen Ping'an truly understand why it took both money and time to refine a life object for a Qi practitioner. For the average Qi practitioner to succeed, they must rely on their wallets while also needing a bit of luck. If luck is lacking, or if they miss a crucial item, it can lead to a complete halt in the refining process. In the path of cultivation, one misstep leads to a crawl, and the invisible losses can drive a Qi practitioner to the brink of madness.

If luck is slightly better, they still suffer injuries. To illustrate, acquiring a suitable refining item would give a rough idea of the cost of supporting materials, intending to spend a Gu Yu coin, which is the actual price for the needed rare materials. However, even if all materials can be gathered, how can they become one’s own? Wild cultivators often rely on theft, valuing the act of robbing others of their treasures, justifying it with claims that neglecting the heavenly gifts will bring misfortune. Cultivators from families rely more on purchasing, using incense and charm to buy from others with immortal coins or trading goods. If there are no connections, one can still throw down immortal coins at places like the Hanging Mountain Lingzhi Zhai, Long Quan County’s Niujiao Mountain Bao Fu Zhai, or Qing Fu Fang. But that’s not all; the costliest situation is when those sought-after rare materials have a dedicated sleeve-sized market where interested buyers each bid on prices, employing a set of heart-wrenching merchant tactics. Once it reaches that point, the final transaction price can be double what a Qi practitioner initially estimated, and there are even those who enjoy sabotaging others, deliberately making things difficult. A piece priced at a Xiaoshu coin could be forced up to three or four Xiaoshu coins. Should the victim buy or not? If they don’t, many good items will slip away, delaying the refining of their life object. What then?

Moreover, among the various celestial mountain factions, the closer they are to each other, the more scheming there tends to be. Who wants to see another mountain faction gain a mid-stage cultivator, especially one who can summon winds and rain? While outright fighting might not happen, underhanded schemes are surely frequent.

Thus, when Mao Xiaodong finished collecting all the rare materials, Chen Ping'an felt a mix of relief and worry.

How should the third life object be refined?

According to the original plan, he should have already been in North Julu Continent by now.

Should he change his mind, gather the remaining compensation from Da Li after the incident in Old Dragon City, sell everything he owns, and after refining the third object at Fallen Mountain, go travel in that land of sword cultivators in North Julu?

Chen Ping'an sighed lightly, reminding himself that tomorrow’s troubles would wait for tomorrow.

It was inappropriate to start contemplating the third life object before he’d even succeeded in refining the golden literary core. Today’s tasks should be completed today; achieving today’s tasks to perfection was the right path.

Chen Ping'an reined in his thoughts, focused his mind, and finally took out the refining vessel from Qing Hu Palace in Tong Ye Continent—the multi-colored golden furnace.

Then he began to silently recite the set of refining techniques gifted by the Water God of the River.

Mao Xiaodong remained silent throughout.

There was no benefit in speaking too much.

Cultivation is a personal matter.

Even if a teacher offers a few words of guidance, that’s usually sufficient.

Even a guardian wouldn’t intervene much; at most, they would try to preserve the cultivator’s foundation if a refining attempt fails, striving for a “preserve the green mountains” philosophy.

Before Chen Ping'an lay a myriad of rare materials, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Mao Xiaodong, who was sitting across from him, and asked, “Mao Shan Master, I actually have a question that I’ve never been able to figure out.”

Mao Xiaodong nodded, “Ask away.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “In our Haoran world, since there are seventy-two academies stationed across the nine continents, why aren’t there seven hundred and twenty? Is it because the Central Plains Wen Miao can’t manage it, or is it that the Sage didn’t wish for it?”

Before answering, Mao Xiaodong slowly said, “I’ll only share my personal views. You can reference them, but they might not be correct. However, it could help you understand the world a bit more, how about that?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Alright!”

Mao Xiaodong continued, “Regarding this matter, I once discussed it with someone. Today, it’s likely that very few worldly people remember that long ago, before the Three-Four Conflict, in the northern Aiai Continent, under the proposal of one of the four great scholarly ancestors, with the strong support of the Liu family and the nod of an Extra-Sage, there once appeared a place known as the ‘Worry-Free Nation.’ This place had a population of about ten million, with no Qi practitioners, no Schools of a Hundred Families, and not even the Three Teachings. Everyone had sufficient food and clothing, and all were literate. The teachings passed down by the Confucian scholars were the essence of the four great scholarly traditions and the Hundred Schools, but they avoided involving the fundamental doctrines of each school, focusing primarily on Confucian texts, with the others as supplements.”

At this point, Mao Xiaodong paused for a moment.

He spoke slowly and earnestly.

So much so that even Mao Xiaodong, as a sage of the academy, seemed somewhat strained.

Chen Ping'an asked, “The teachers you mentioned, are they the carefully selected scholars from the academy?”

Mao Xiaodong shook his head, “Of course not; otherwise, it would be meaningless. Even if it succeeded, the customs of one nation could at most evolve into one continent, yet it would starve the other eight continents. What meaning would there be in that? Hence, the Liu family in Aiai Continent, under various oversight, secretly prepared for nearly forty years beforehand. Every aspect had to gain the approval of many representatives from the Hundred Schools present. If even one person denied it, it couldn’t be implemented. This was the only time the Sage of Rites made an appearance and proposed this singular requirement.”

Chen Ping'an asked with curiosity, “Was the final outcome not satisfactory?”

Mao Xiaodong nodded, “Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been the later Three-Four Conflict.”

Chen Ping'an fell into deep thought, pondering why it had failed.

It was a tangled mess.

Mao Xiaodong softly said, “From the Sage to the Sage of Rites, one elucidates benevolence and righteousness, while the other formulates rules and frameworks. Why is that?”

Mao Xiaodong answered himself, “Before I answer this question, I once asked that person why the Sage and the Sage of Rites, after establishing the exclusive and legitimate status of the Haoran world, still allowed the Hundred Schools to exist. Why not simply leave only the teachings of Confucianism to educate the people? That person’s response opened my eyes, revealing the vastness of the world. That person said, the Dao Ancestor sees the whole, and so the remnants of that initial chaos were allowed to migrate to the Sword Qi Great Wall. And in our Haoran world, we didn’t completely eradicate the demon race either. The Buddha only left behind a prophecy that the era of decline would eventually come, saying, ‘From now on, within my law, even if one shaves their head and wears a cassock, breaks the prohibitions, and acts contrary to the law.’”

Mao Xiaodong asked, “What do you think these three seek?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, unsure.

Mao Xiaodong stated, “The person told me he also didn’t know the answer. But perhaps it was to offer all sentient beings a form of freedom, a kind of freedom that doesn’t require any additional cost to attain.”

Mao Xiaodong asked, “Do you understand?”

Chen Ping'an honestly replied, “I don’t.”

Mao Xiaodong smiled, “Chen Ping'an, you don’t need to chase after the answers to these questions right now.”

Mao Xiaodong stood up, raised one foot off the ground, and hovered in the air for a moment before lifting it twice more, “At present, focus on what you’ve learned, know its roots and true meanings, and progress step by step. Then, regardless of how high you stand, your heart will remain steady. No matter what chaotic paths arise, at the very least, we scholars should be like this.”

Chen Ping'an recalled his conversation with Yao Jin at the peak of the Da Quan Dynasty regarding the circles of life that one navigates, and he smiled knowingly, “I understand that.”

Mao Xiaodong sat back down and asked with a smile, “You truly understand?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I really do!”

Mao Xiaodong extended a hand, smiling, “With the right timing, location, and harmony of people, then you can commence refining.”

Chen Ping'an first closed his eyes, taking a gentle breath.

A golden literary core quietly hovered before him.

Chen Ping'an still did not rush to ignite it with pure martial true energy; instead, he inexplicably recalled an event from his youth in the ancestral home of Ni Ping Alley.

On the second day of the second month, the dragon raises its head, candles illuminate the rafters, and peach blossoms hit the walls; there’s no place for snakes and insects to hide in the world…

That was probably the very beginning of Chen Ping'an’s journey through the martial world.

At that time, many people had yet to encounter him.

But step by step, he met one after another.

Practicing fist was not arduous. Reading was worthwhile.

Persisting in reasoning with others turned out to be something that may not always be satisfying but would not lead to regret.

It turned out that I, Chen Ping'an, could also have today.

It turned out that Miss Ning had such good taste!

Mao Xiaodong shouted, “Your mindset is getting too carried away; pause for a moment!”

Mao Xiaodong nearly struck him with a ruler in anger, teaching him, “Even if you have a crush, think about your life object’s success first! When the time comes, who cares how many hours you think about it? Will you not be overjoyed then?! You’re being careless!”

Chen Ping'an, slightly disgruntled, quickly wiped his face, suppressing the smile, and refocused his mind.

Mao Xiaodong seemed furious, but in his heart, he was quite pleased, silently murmuring, “Master, did I do well? Is it unreasonable to ask for a word of praise from the master?”

———

At the peak of Donghua Mountain, as Mao Xiaodong and Chen Ping'an sat facing each other.

In the academy, two others sat across from one another, the thunder law expert, Dong Jing, and his half-disciple, Lin Shouyi.

As the world fell into silence and time flowed, showing signs of manifestation, Dong Jing furrowed his brows, seeing the flicker of Lin Shouyi’s inherent spiritual light about to cease. He waved his sleeve, creating a small isolated space, though this great Confucian appeared somewhat strained.

Dong Jing solemnly said, “Don’t get distracted. Just like in reading, when you come across marvelous and incomprehensible sage writings, being able to immerse yourself in them is a skill. Pulling them out shows your mastery. Otherwise, you’ll end up as a bookworm, what’s there to talk about regarding resonating with sages?!”

Lin Shouyi nodded slightly.

Dong Jing continued the previous topic, “Don’t rush. Strive to open up two more life qi houses. Breaking through isn’t urgent. For us Confucian students practicing Qi, our physical cultivation talent isn’t the most crucial. The Confucian doctrine has already established the orthodox lineage of the Haoran world. In the end, Confucian cultivation is all about studying the word ‘learning.’ I ask you, Lin Shouyi, why do so many in the world clearly know the principles in books but remain muddle-headed, even living in a manner inconsistent with virtue?”

Lin Shouyi solemnly replied, “Not knowing the root of certain principles or kinds of knowledge, naturally, they wouldn’t know how to navigate the world with those principles. Hence, words of wisdom that weigh a thousand pounds, when obtained, turn into tattered cotton, blown away by the wind, unable to ward off the cold. In the end, they blame the principles for being wrong, which is a great folly.”

“You’ve only got half of it right. The wrong half lies in the fact that many of the teachings of the sages weren’t meant for people to grasp tangible things with their hands, but rather to provide a resting place for the heart.”

Dong Jing nodded appreciatively, “Then today, I’ll say just one phrase from the sages to you, and we’ll elaborate on it.”

Lin Shouyi sat upright, “I’m eager to hear the master’s teachings.”

Dong Jing asked, “The sage says, ‘A gentleman is not an object.’ What does this mean? How do the Ritual Records interpret it? How does the pure Confucian Chen family interpret it? What does the E Hu Academy interpret it? What do the Tongcheng faction of Qing Luan Kingdom interpret it? And what do you yourself interpret it as?”

Lin Shouyi was full of confidence and was about to answer this series of questions when he suddenly noticed Dong Jing turning his head, gazing out the window, clearly more distracted than he was.

Lin Shouyi hesitated for a moment, seeing that Dong Jing had no intention of retracting his gaze, and he followed suit, turning to look.

Only to see a head hanging outside the window.

Dong Jing shouted angrily, “Cui Dongshan, what are you doing?!”

Cui Dongshan wore an innocent expression, “I’m just afraid that if Lin Shouyi asks you a question that you can’t answer, it would be too awkward. I’m here to help you out.”

Dong Jing pointed a finger, glaring, “You better scram!”

The matter of teaching is incredibly solemn, yet here comes this notorious rat from the academy causing chaos.

Cui Dongshan hung onto the windowsill with both hands, his feet off the ground, blinking, “If I don’t leave, will you hit me?”

Dong Jing settled his mind, planning to reason with this fellow and then threaten him with the authority of the academy’s Mao Shan Master, but before he could do so, Cui Dongshan had already released his grip, and that annoying head finally vanished from sight.

Dong Jing snorted coldly.

But then Cui Dongshan popped back up, leaning his arms on the windowsill, laughing heartily, “I’m back again.”

Dong Jing yelled angrily, “Cui Dongshan, as a Nascent Soul cultivator, you’re doing such nonsense. Is it not boring?!”

Cui Dongshan retorted, “I’m just bored to death, so I came looking for something interesting to do; otherwise, why would I come here?”

Dong Jing stood up, “Want to fight?!”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “A gentleman speaks but doesn’t fight.”

Dong Jing was so furious he marched out.

How many practitioners of thunder law, especially earth immortals, have a good temper?

Cui Dongshan lightly tapped his toes against the wall, floating backward and waving goodbye.

Lin Shouyi wore a bitter smile.

Dong Jing stood by the window, waiting a long time after confirming Cui Dongshan had left before returning to his seat.

Cui Dongshan, however, didn’t continue lingering. He swaggered into several classrooms and dormitories, encountering Li Huai, who was dozing off in class. Cui Dongshan rewarded the little brat with several chestnuts before changing the hairstyle of a young woman from a prominent family in Da Sui, who sat in front of her in class, to a style that he felt suited her temperament better. He then met a pretty girl in the dormitory who was secretly reading a romantic novel and took the ink, smudging out the most embarrassing parts of the book...

This goes to show that Cui Dongshan was indeed terribly bored.

Wandering here and there, in the end, Cui Dongshan glanced at the peak of Donghua Mountain and returned to his small courtyard, where he promptly fell into a deep sleep.

Xie Xie, “wearing” a shed of immortal skin, could move freely.

Without the last binding of the Confined Dragon Nail, walking had become somewhat difficult, yet sitting on the steps, feeling the flow of time was still manageable.

Cui Dongshan suddenly sprang up without warning, startling both Xie Xie and Shi Rou.

Cui Dongshan recalled the girl named Li Liu from a few years ago, who had made a threatening gesture at him near the academy entrance.

The girl appeared inexperienced and unaware of the dangers of the world.

Cui Dongshan fell back onto the ground with a thud, mumbling, “So the ruler of the rivers and lakes, no wonder your heart is set so high.”

Cui Dongshan closed his eyes and fell asleep.

Xie Xie and Shi Rou simultaneously turned to look at the peak of Donghua Mountain.

There, the flowing time seemed to have taken on a layer of vast golden hue for some reason.

However, in an instant, Shi Rou quickly glanced at Cui Dongshan.

That day when Chen Ping'an said, “Think about it again,” she had clearly seen Cui Dongshan, who had his back to Chen Ping'an, with tears streaming down his face.

Cui Dongshan, who had clearly fallen into a deep sleep, snapped his fingers.

Shi Rou instantly felt a thunderous sensation in her abdomen, a feeling she hadn’t experienced in hundreds of years.

Cui Dongshan turned his head, beaming, and reminded, “Don’t do that in my courtyard, hurry and find a bathroom; otherwise, you’ll either stink me out or I’ll beat you up!”

Shi Rou, full of indignation and despair, dashed away.

Cui Dongshan rolled around in the corridor, saying, “Xie Xie, where are you going to find a gentleman to clean the corridor for you, huh?”

Xie Xie could only comply, “Thank you, thank you for your kindness, young master.”

Cui Dongshan lay on the corridor floor, in a frog-like posture, swimming from one end to the other, then flipping over to repeat the process while humming, “The frog doesn’t drink water; it’s a peaceful year, oh, peaceful year…”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 415: The Bittersweet Dance of Joys and Sorrows

The academy had become a small world under the watchful eye of the Saint, a realm of its own atop Donghua Mountain, where another heaven awaited.

After Mao Xiaodong invoked his great powers, the mountaintop was already transformed into a golden autumn.

The air was crisp and refreshing.

Chen Ping'an sat facing the west, a colorful golden stove placed before him. He utilized the spiritual energy nurtured by the Water Palace to "fan the flames," while a pure martial artist's genuine Qi served to "ignite" the stove, driving the alchemical furnace within to blaze with fierce refining flames.

The furnace suddenly radiated brilliant light, resembling a radiant sun in the human realm.

A golden literary spirit hovered above the furnace, slowly descending.

Chen Ping'an was no stranger to this scene, methodically following the method derived from the rain-praying stele at the front of the Water God Temple. He skillfully wielded a palm-sized jar of golden sand and sprinkled it into the furnace, intensifying the flames until his entire face glowed a bright red, especially his clear eyes, which had seen countless mountains and rivers, sparkling with brilliance. His hands, which had shaped countless porcelain pieces, showed no trace of trembling, his mind as calm as a still lake, akin to an ancient well devoid of ripples.

The golden literary spirit, once "extracted" from Chen Ping'an’s heart by City God Shen Wen, surged and swayed within the furnace, gradually rotating and tumbling.

It bore the essence of the countless devotees who had worshipped in the colorful-clad nation for centuries, the persistent righteous Qi remaining after the death of the civil servant Shen Wen, and the divine essence nurtured through daily interactions with the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain, all twinkling like stars scattered across the initial night sky.

Among the many heavenly materials and earthly treasures, the relic sword of the Martial Sage from the capital city’s martial temple on Baoping Continent, along with a half-zhang long bullhorn aged a millennium, proved to be the most difficult to refine.

Chen Ping'an maintained his peace of mind, taking each step steadily and correctly, carefully refining each item with the immortal method of "all things can be refined."

The sword, once wielded by the Martial Sage throughout his life on the battlefield, hovered above the furnace, gradually melting. From the sword's tip, a drop of golden water emerged, dropping into the colorful golden stove. As time passed, the rate of the water falling increased, forming a line. If someone could peer inside the small world of the furnace using inner vision, they would see that the stream of droplets resembled a golden Milky Way waterfall descending into the mortal realm.

The golden essence nourished the lungs.

To cultivate and nourish the lungs, practitioners had already discovered a set of rules, with the Qi Sea, Shen Zhong, and the lung acupoint being of utmost importance.

As Chen Ping'an breathed, he intentionally and unintentionally operated the Eighteen Stops of Sword Qi through these three acupoints, instantly releasing sword Qi like a rainbow. The surface of his skin slightly rippled, akin to drums beating on the battlefield, while atop Donghua Mountain, no sound could be heard. Yet, within his body’s small world, the three battlefields were filled with a murderous intent dominated by sword Qi, as if the spirits of countless sword immortals still lingered, unwilling to rest.

The refining of over thirty heavenly materials and earthly treasures followed a strict order; each item had to be placed in the furnace at the designated time without fail, and any deviation in the furnace's heat could spell disaster.

At this moment, Mao Xiaodong, serving as the Confucian Saint at the academy, could use his profound secret arts to remind Chen Ping'an without worrying about distracting him, which could lead to a deviation in his practice.

However, Chen Ping'an did not grant him that opportunity.

He remained focused, undistracted, using the immortal method of refining to transform one heavenly material after another from solid to ethereal. With the Water Palace continuing to supply spiritual energy and the newly born pure genuine Qi, he carefully controlled the furnace's heat, amplifying the "battlefield" power of the three acupoints with the Eighteen Stops of Sword Qi. The refining of this golden literary spirit involved Confucian cultivation, presenting an additional great challenge compared to the typical refining of a practitioner’s innate item. He had to silently recite texts related to the metal element of the Five Elements, such as those containing the characters for west, autumn, and so on—most of which were selected by Chen Ping'an from bamboo slips, with a small portion suggested by Mao Xiaodong back in the study.

This challenge in Confucian cultivation was known as "paying respects to the sages with words from the lungs."

Mao Xiaodong was genuinely worried about this hurdle.

In fact, his initial trip to the Da Sui capital's Confucian Temple was not only to retrieve the dividends owed to the mountain academy but also to borrow more ceremonial vessels and ritual implements. This stemmed from his fear that Chen Ping'an might make mistakes in the refining process, given that Chen Ping'an had never encountered the cultivation methods of the Confucian students, and there were no shortcuts to take. He could only make do with the rich literary fortune contained in the ceremonial items from the temple, forcing his way through the obstacles.

Fortunately, Chen Ping'an performed even better than the elder had anticipated.

This indicated that Chen Ping'an had truly absorbed the knowledge he had read; the principles in the books resonated with him, becoming the very foundation upon which he stood. Just as Mao Xiaodong had casually remarked while leading Chen Ping'an to the Confucian Temple, the words in books did not grow legs; whether they could enter one's mind and heart depended on one's own effort to "break through," to truly engage with the texts! The principles of Confucianism were indeed numerous, but they had never been a cage to bind people; rather, they represented the essence of acting freely within boundaries.

Mao Xiaodong sighed deeply.

The true Confucian Temple of Zhongtu Shenzhou had a hidden learning hall, filled with texts left behind by Confucian sages, recognized by heaven and earth.

The characters varied in size, with the golden light differing in intensity.

The closer the golden characters were to the ground, the larger they tended to be, radiating brighter and purer light.

Many founding figures of the Hundred Schools of Thought, or some newly prominent scholars, had revered this place. They could demonstrate their powers, and some higher up could even manage to move individual characters, but to this day, no one had been able to budge the massive golden characters that resembled giant grains of corn on the ground.

For that was the fundamental teaching of the Greatest Sage and the Master of Rites.

Yet even so, some of the characters hovering slightly above the learning hall, belonging to the Greatest Sage and the Master of Rites, had begun to lose their brilliance and dissipate. When this unprecedented phenomenon occurred in the secret history of the Confucian Temple, the scholars were shaken and alarmed. Even a Confucian deputy lord stationed there had to quickly bathe and change before rushing to the statues of the Greatest Sage and the Master of Rites, lighting incense at both.

But the two saints still did not make an appearance.

It was at that moment that a scholar, not yet revered as a sub-saint by the Confucian lineage, remarked, “There is no knowledge that remains unchanged throughout the ages, and no perfect writing worth being overly alarmed about; otherwise, what do we study for?”

This statement calmed the hearts of the people at the temple.

Mao Xiaodong collected his thoughts and looked at the young man sitting across from him.

He appeared ethereal, his spirit soaring like jade trees in a celestial forest, untouched by worldly dust.

His aura resembled a luminous pearl of the night, akin to a miniature moon fallen from the heavens, yet to be collected by the moon’s deities, countless fragments shimmering like brilliant stars, encircling him like a halo.

With such a younger disciple.

As a senior brother, how could he not feel proud?

This had nothing to do with one’s background or cultivation level.

His teacher was the Sage of Literature, and his fellow seniors, Qi Jingchun and others, had long been acquainted with Ah Liang. Even the Rites Academy had high hopes for him, once even seeking guidance from the famed scholar who opened the Yellow River’s small heaven with a single sword.

He too had experienced many great opportunities, traversed numerous paths of learning, met countless talented individuals, and even shared countless drinks with old farmers, journeying through vast mountains and rivers.

Yet Mao Xiaodong still felt he was inferior to Chen Ping'an.

Because he had missed too many opportunities, failing to grasp them.

Cui Dongshan had once inadvertently mentioned the most perilous phase of Chen Ping'an's heart journey after leaving Li Zhu Cave.

It was not about fighting or killing; it was about Ah Liang finding him.

That seemingly risk-free test of fortune, if Chen Ping'an’s heart wavered even slightly, he would end up like Zhao Yao, perhaps encountering his own opportunities in the years to come. Yet, Chen Ping'an would certainly miss Ah Liang, miss Qi Jingchun, miss the huge opportunity that Qi Jingchun painstakingly earned for him, miss the old scholar, and ultimately miss the woman he admired. One misstep could lead to a cascade of errors, resulting in total loss.

Mao Xiaodong had to ask at that time, “Then how did Chen Ping'an manage to navigate through such dangers?”

Cui Dongshan provided a rather unorthodox answer: “My master knows he’s foolish, and of course, luck plays a part.”

Mao Xiaodong wanted to dig deeper, but Cui Dongshan was no longer willing to continue.

In the end, the ceremonial vessels and ritual implements that Mao Xiaodong brought from the capital’s Confucian Temple did not serve as a timely aid but rather as a finishing touch.

However, Mao Xiaodong was even more delighted about this.

It meant that the quality of the golden literary spirit being refined into an innate item would be higher.

While it would certainly pale in comparison to that water-character seal, where else could one find a seal inscribed with Qi Jingchun's own spirit?

Even Mao Xiaodong felt regret for Chen Ping'an, who had inadvertently damaged the mountain-character seal at Jiaolong Gorge; otherwise, a grand pattern of “mountains and waters relying on each other” could have been created. It would not have been as simple as succeeding with two innate items and breaking through the second realm bottleneck to reach the pinnacle of the second realm of Qi practitioners. It would have guaranteed a peak in the third realm! Even if the remaining three innate items had lesser quality, as long as they fulfilled the requirements of the Five Elements, they would surely break through the first significant threshold of Qi practitioners and directly reach the middle of the fifth realm!

However, Mao Xiaodong also understood that bringing Qi Jingchun’s mountain-character seal to the Inverted Mountain could lead to significant setbacks.

These seemingly intangible choices of gains and losses might represent a deeper "fundamental knowledge" that Chen Ping'an possessed, far surpassing his skills in martial arts, sword practice, and even some of the principles he had already grasped.

Regarding this matter, Cui Dongshan was the most knowledgeable. The distinction between deities and mortals, the essence of why one is human—Cui Dongshan and Cui Chan had traversed far along this intricate and profound path, perhaps becoming the furthest beings in the world.

It was said that before Cui Chan decided to break away from the lineage of the Sage of Literature, he spent three days and nights in silence at the learning hall of the Confucian Temple, merely gazing at the golden characters on the ground, especially the ones at the bottom, without looking at those slightly higher up.

Mao Xiaodong let out a small sigh.

Regardless, successfully refining this golden literary spirit into an innate item was an exceptionally rare opportunity.

One should not seek perfection; the heart should remain grounded.

No longer lost in thought, Mao Xiaodong began to pour each ceremonial vessel and ritual implement’s literary fortune into the furnace one by one, executing the technique to perfection.

Thus, a scene of breathtaking beauty unfolded, as the mountaintop’s flowing time shimmered with a golden hue in the eyes of Xie Xie Shi Rou.

The colorful haze surrounding the furnace suddenly fell silent, the smoke and clouds dissipating.

The golden literary spirit quietly lying at the bottom of the colorful golden stove transformed into golden liquid and slowly "grew" into a scholar dressed in a golden robe with a sword on his back, standing a finger's height. With a leap, he reached the rim of the furnace, looking up at Chen Ping'an, though his features remained blurred and unfocused, resembling Chen Ping'an's form, except for the long sword on his back and several small golden books tied with delicate golden threads hanging at his waist. The golden-robed figure spoke in an elderly yet dignified manner: “Read more! Furthermore, as you said, knowing one is wrong and being able to change is of utmost importance!”

Already sweating profusely, Chen Ping'an wiped his forehead and nodded with a smile: “Let’s encourage each other.”

The golden little scholar transformed into a long rainbow, swiftly dashing into Chen Ping'an's lung acupoints, sitting cross-legged and picking up a book tied at his waist, beginning to flip through it.

In addition, another golden literary spirit hovered within the cave, essentially the same entity as the golden-robed scholar with a sword on his back.

Mao Xiaodong was taken aback for a moment, then began to frown.

Chen Ping'an questioned, “Is something wrong?”

Mao Xiaodong’s expression grew serious as he asked, “That golden literary spirit refined into an innate item, condensing into a scholarly figure, I don’t find it too surprising. But why did it say that?”

Chen Ping'an pondered seriously for a moment and replied: “Ever since I learned to read, I’ve always been afraid that the principles I derive might be wrong. So, whether it was facing the youth in blue back then, or later with Pei Qian, or when Cui Dongshan asked me those two questions, I’ve been very cautious, fearing that my understanding, while reasonable to myself, might actually be incorrect for others or at least superficial and lacking in comprehensiveness. I worry about misleading others.”

Mao Xiaodong felt relieved and smiled with satisfaction: “That’s… very correct!”

Mao Xiaodong stood up, waved his hand to withdraw the saintly powers atop the mountain, but the small world of the academy remained intact, instructing: “You have one incense stick’s worth of time. Next, you can take out that golden jade tablet inscribed with ‘I nurture the vast righteous Qi’ to absorb some of the remaining literary fortune from the ceremonial vessels and ritual implements. Don’t worry about crossing boundaries and accidentally stealing Donghua Mountain’s literary fortune and spiritual energy; I will weigh the pros and cons. After this, you will officially become a second-realm Qi practitioner.”

Chen Ping'an hurriedly stood up to express his gratitude.

Mao Xiaodong waved his hand, complaining: “Really can’t tell where you picked up this politeness from, little disciple.”

Chen Ping'an joked: “Perhaps it’s from the Sage of Literature?”

Mao Xiaodong immediately straightened his face and said seriously: “You must thoroughly comprehend the Sage's good intentions!”

Chen Ping'an awkwardly replied: “I was joking.”

Mao Xiaodong scolded: “The Sage conveys his teachings through both words and actions, in every little detail. As a junior, how can you be careless? How can you joke about such things!”

Chen Ping'an could only nod in agreement.

Mao Xiaodong turned around, a smile on his face, showing no trace of anger. Little disciple, you’re still so young.

Time flowed backward in the long river of the mountaintop; golden autumn regressed back to the splendor of summer, fallen leaves returning to branches, withered yellows turning to lush greens.

After Mao Xiaodong left, Chen Ping'an took out the golden jade tablet, holding it in his palm, and began to absorb the residual literary fortune from the summit of Donghua Mountain that had not been refined by the furnace.

A slender golden stream, as thick as a thumb, coiled around the jade tablet, gently flowing into it.

From the jade tablet, it merged into Chen Ping'an’s palm, traveling to the lung acupoint where the golden literary spirit resided.

Everywhere it touched nourished Chen Ping'an's heart.

As the golden literary stream flowed into the acupoint, the golden-robed scholar immediately stopped reading, grinning from ear to ear, bouncing with joy, dancing energetically.

This was perhaps the childlike nature that Chen Ping'an rarely had the chance to reveal during his growing years.

Once the golden figure reached the threshold of the cave, it shouted, and a fire dragon formed from pure genuine Qi flew swiftly toward it.

With a jump, it sat atop the dragon's head, shouting and shaking its feet vigorously, riding the dragon as it patrolled this small world of the human body.

Chen Ping'an, using inner vision to observe this scene, felt a bit embarrassed.

“Why am I so mischievous?”

It felt no different from Gu Can and the youth in blue!

---

Mao Xiaodong had been quietly observing this whole time.

In the end, Chen Ping'an completely drained the literary fortune from the Da Sui Confucian Temple using the golden jade tablet, leaving not a drop behind.

Even though refining his innate item had nearly exhausted the Water Palace’s accumulated spiritual energy, he was now a bona fide Qi practitioner. Not to mention Donghua Mountain’s literary fortune, even the relatively less valuable spiritual energy, he would not take a single drop, even with his senior brother having opened his mouth.

Only at this moment did Mao Xiaodong begin to comprehend why Chen Ping'an managed to navigate through such dangers.

Self-restraint.

It was that simple.

Such a seemingly pedantic and rigid attitude, as a practitioner, unaware of pursuing the maximization of benefits, would give clever individuals in the world ample reasons to ridicule and mock him.

Thus, the principles that Chen Ping'an derived would incite particular disdain from those who did not value reason.

Mao Xiaodong’s heart suddenly trembled.

The heavy stone weighing down on his mindset, which had almost severed his path to the fifth realm, seemed to have started to shift.

Principles are not confined to literary context.

Mao Xiaodong respected his teacher and was determined to follow him throughout his life, yet he need not be bound by sectarian biases, intentionally excluding the teachings of the Master of Rites for the sake of the academy’s literary fortune.

Some principles in the world are interconnected, supporting and complementing one another.

Mao Xiaodong sat in the study, gently placing the ruler aside on the desk, and began to close his eyes to meditate.

With deep accumulation, a sudden enlightenment would turn the tides; the heavens and earth would shift, and the wind and moon would shine brightly.

---

Cui Dongshan sat up in the small courtyard corridor, surprised: “Has Mao Xiaodong finally found his way?”

Cui Dongshan leaned back, flailing his arms and legs like a white turtle turned upside down… he loudly lamented: “Why am I still a damned Nascent Soul? How will I live in the future? I can't face the master anymore; someone just kill me already…”

---

At Fengwei Crossing.

Three elderly men walked side by side.

Though they appeared to be of similar age, they were vastly different in reality.

The local elder, who had always avoided revealing himself, was thoroughly tired of worldly entanglements.

Yet this time, an old acquaintance remarked, “You’re not a street rat, so why hide?”

Thus, the three of them confidently made their way onto the streets of Fengwei Crossing.

The elder named Liu Laocheng had already sensed the astonished gazes upon them but pretended not to see, silently leading the two others to his ancestral home in a narrow alley.

Liu Laocheng thought to himself, if you knew the identities of the two by your side, you’d probably be scared out of your wits.

For Liu Laocheng hailed from this border area between the Qingtai, Qing Mountain, and Yunxiao nations. He had ultimately become the sole survivor of Baoping Continent, a wild cultivation practitioner who had stepped into the fifth realm.

The other two were an invincible elder of the God Fist Gang, Gao Mian, who had famously fallen from the Jade Purity realm back to the Nascent Soul realm for the sake of jianghu loyalty, and was a well-known figure in Baoping Continent.

Liu Laocheng was a close and trusted friend of Gao Mian, which is why he had invited him along for the endeavor to seize the shattered golden body of Du Mao’s failed ascension.

Gao Mian was short and dressed in coarse clothing, exuding a rough aura, appearing even more intimidating than Liu Laocheng, resembling a wild practitioner who robbed and pillaged.

As for the last elder, dressed in a long robe and hailing from a different continent, one could hardly believe his identity unless Liu Laocheng and Gao Mian vouched for him.

His surname was Xun, and his given name was Yuan.

He was the former leader of the Yuguizong, the foremost figure in the realm of immortals on Tongye Continent.

Even Jiang Shangzhen, the head of the Jiang family from Yunkufudi, a notoriously domineering practitioner, would still have to keep his tail tucked between his legs when meeting Xun Yuan… to be precise, he would need to act like a god.

Upon reaching the end of the narrow alley, Gao Mian loudly asked, “Liu Lao’er, when is that brat Jiang Yun coming to our gang as a guest? He’s so good-looking; I reckon he’ll attract quite a few fairies to our mountain.”

Liu Laocheng helplessly replied, “My disciple is staying at the God Fist Gang just to give you a chance to feast your eyes and see more fairies. How can I possibly bring this up with Jiang Yun? Or are you going to lend me your face?”

Gao Mian stepped over the threshold, “Just keep playing dumb. Back when we roamed the jianghu together, you learned that secret technique for what? Aside from stealing treasures, how many fairies did you swipe…”

Liu Laocheng covered Gao Mian’s mouth with a hand, angrily retorting, “Who hasn’t had a wild and reckless youth? Discussing these trivial matters is unworthy of the esteemed Xun Laozu!”

Xun Yuan smiled gently: “Not at all.”

Gao Mian sat down in the courtyard, waving his hand, “Liu Lao’er, go buy a few jars of the best well-brewed immortal wine. Jiang Yun must have polished them off at home, no question about it.”

Liu Laocheng bid farewell to Xun Yuan, stepping out to buy wine.

When he returned, he found the two men admiring the “water flower mirror moon” of numerous small and medium-sized hills on Baoping Continent—a stunning painting. Gao Mian had already prepared a heap of immortal coins in front of Xun Yuan.

Liu Laocheng found this utterly uninteresting, yet he still politely handed a jar of well-brewed immortal wine to Xun Yuan, saying, “Xun Laozu truly has an exquisite taste.”

Xun Yuan nodded with a smile.

The painting depicted a “fairy” engaged in the act of incense-burning and painting, her figure enchanting, deliberately choosing a somewhat tight-fitting dress. The composition allowed viewers to adjust the direction of the scene, and the fairy's sitting posture was meticulously considered, highlighting her voluptuous figure and curves.

Gao Mian glanced slyly at Xun Yuan, snorting with laughter as he adjusted the painting slightly. Instantly, it transformed into a captivating view of the mountain peaks from the side. With a flick of his fingers, the figure of the woman in the painting suddenly grew larger, while the surrounding scenery receded.

Gao Mian didn’t forget to mock, “Why act so serious?”

Xun Yuan blushed slightly, seemingly hesitant to retort.

Liu Laocheng drank his wine with a helpless look.

It was said that two practitioners from different continents initially had little in common, but in the realm of Baoping Continent’s various illusions and reflections, the character known as the “Jade-faced Young Master” and the real identity of the invincible elder of the God Fist Gang, who had a fiery temper and often berated pretentious individuals, were alike in their disdain for the fawning attitudes of certain fairies who openly flirted with wealthy patrons.

Many female practitioners of minor sects, in order to attract business for their sects, had either been forced or willingly altered their natural appearances with the help of practitioners skilled in disguise. As for whether this would affect their fate, ruining their cultivation path, they couldn’t care less, allowing those adept in this art to operate freely on their faces. 

The Jade-faced Young Master and the One-footed Spear crossed paths, and many sharp-eyed spectators noticed a third-rate fairy from a minor sect whose appearance had drastically changed, resulting in a flurry of mockery and scorn.

The fairy, furious and humiliated, dared not retort; she only kept apologizing, repeatedly.

As the mockery intensified, it became increasingly brazen.

Unexpectedly, the Jade-faced Young Master suddenly threw money and spoke out boldly, denouncing the hecklers. The One-footed Spear followed suit, and for the first time, these two sworn foes united against a common enemy.

Once the Young Master had finished tossing out his immortal coins, he continued to scold, “Earning money is hard, and cultivating is tough. Did this little girl offend you in her pursuit of the Dao? Or has she harmed your entire family? Must you continue to harass her? You bunch of little bastards shouldn’t have been born to your parents! If I had such divine powers, I’d go upstream along the river of time and smash your parents’ bed while they were at it!”

Finally, the Young Master turned to the One-footed Spear, saying, “You still count as a man, but your taste is poor; you clearly prefer He Xiaoliang over Su Jia. That’s a sign of a lackluster cultivation path!”

After that, the One-footed Spear became the Young Master’s “sidekick,” always playing the sycophant whenever they met.

Before Gao Mian and Xun Yuan began tossing coins, people had already started teasing that fairy. Amidst the illusions, the spectators did not know each other, and they often felt free to mock without restraint, regularly enjoying the painting or water bowl while keeping popular romance novels nearby.

This inevitably affected the maidservant standing by the fairy, who was also dragged into the mess.

The maidservant, named Shi Qiu, had recently joined the mountain as a disciple. Whenever her master made an appearance, she occasionally appeared in the painting, serving tea or delivering items, performing the mundane tasks of a servant.

In fact, her figure surpassed that fairy’s, but in the mountains, one’s status was determined by talent and realm.

For Gao Mian and Xun Yuan, experienced in the ways of the world, this was all too common; generally speaking, unless it was excessive, they wouldn’t say much.

However, the maidservant named Shi Qiu had probably not yet gotten used to the unbearable insults, her eyes reddening as she bit her lip.

Misfortune struck again; from this angle of the painting, Gao Mian happened to see the fairy stomp on the foot of the maidservant, who was likely infuriated by the fairy's presence.

Gao Mian had initially intended to start tossing immortal coins but, upon witnessing this scene, tossed the handful of coins back into the pile.

Taking a sip of wine, Gao Mian coldly snorted: “Another one of those women, wasted all that scholarly air brought from the secular world.”

Xun Yuan smiled faintly.

Gao Mian felt somewhat disheartened, merely drinking.

Liu Laocheng reminded him, “Old Gao, take it easy; if you’re sober, you’re a figure of Baoping Continent. Once you start drinking, the whole continent becomes yours. This is my ancestral home; it can't handle your drunken rampage!”

Gao Mian snorted, suddenly asking: “Xiao Fei Cheng, what do you think of the name 'Invincible God Fist Gang'?”

Xun Yuan’s gaze remained fixed on the painting, responding without hesitation: “Strong, invincible, domineering—stands out on Baoping Continent, unique!”

Gao Mian nodded, “You know how to speak my language, giving me some heartfelt words.”

Liu Laocheng couldn’t hold back any longer, saying to Xun Yuan: “Xun Lao Zuzu, what’s the point? Everything else can be overlooked, but this old Gao’s ridiculous gang name has made the disciples of the mountain feel ashamed. Do you really need to flatter him so insincerely? I, Liu Laocheng… can’t bear it anymore!”

As the foremost wild practitioner of Baoping Continent, Liu Laocheng had seen all manner of peculiar people and events, yet the bond between Xun Yuan, a leader of the immortal realm from Tongye Continent, and Gao Mian, a former sect elder who had fallen back to the Nascent Soul realm, was quite rare. Ignoring their different realms and the disparity between their sects, Liu Laocheng could barely understand it. But why did Xun Yuan have to shower so much praise on this uncouth old fellow, Gao Mian?

Initially, Liu Laocheng feared Xun Yuan had ulterior motives, but given that Xun Yuan was willing to confront the Daoist Heavenly Lord Qi Zhen and had even discussed the ownership of the shattered cave with the saints, along with the fact that the three of them had leisurely traveled together afterward, even someone as cautious as Liu Laocheng had to admit that Xun Yuan genuinely regarded Gao Mian as a friend, while Gao Mian treated Xun Yuan with the familiarity of an old comrade.

Both of them were… sincere.

Xun Yuan smiled at Liu Laocheng: “I genuinely believe that the name 'Invincible God Fist Gang' is excellent.”

Liu Laocheng sighed, clasped his fists with a wry smile: “I’m impressed.”

Gao Mian said: “Liu Laocheng, in other matters, you surpass Xiao Fei Cheng, but in terms of aesthetics, you fall far behind.”

Xun Yuan clapped his knees, “Exactly! Young Master, your words have enlightened me. I had always wondered why I felt so solitary on the path of cultivation. Today, you’ve revealed the secret; it’s indeed due to differing tastes in aesthetics. If I hadn’t met you…”

Gao Mian slammed the table, “Is that flattery really necessary? I’ve been hearing that nonsense in the Invincible God Fist Gang for ages!”

Xun Yuan could only fall silent.

With no other illusions to observe today, Gao Mian intentionally withdrew his Qi as a practitioner and drank to drunkenness, heading off to sleep.

Only then did Xun Yuan dare to toss a few small summer coins into the painting and say that if the maidservant Shi Qiu could appear in the painting alone in the future, he would willingly support her every time.

Then Xun Yuan put away the painting.

Human joys and sorrows are as plentiful as the stars, and Xun Yuan did not wish to delve into the muddy waters of worldly affairs, touching on everything lightly.

Liu Laocheng hesitated for a long while before saying: “Xun Lao Zuzu, as Gao Mian’s friend, I wish to ask you a bold question. As the leader of the Yuguizong, do you truly have no ulterior motives regarding Gao Mian?”

Xun Yuan shook his head and smiled: “Indeed not. I simply wish to come to Baoping Continent to explore, and since I only have Gao Mian as a friend here, who else would I seek out?”

Liu Laocheng nodded.

Xun Yuan continued: “However, I do have a personal interest. For a Qi practitioner to ascend to the fifth realm, one must seek the Dao of unity, breaking through the heart demons that come with the saying ‘the Dao is high, and the demons are even higher.’ To put it another way, it’s like borrowing something from the heavens, which must be repaid during the immortal realm. And to advance further in the immortal realm, it’s all about seeking truth, especially focusing on that word ‘truth.’”

Liu Laocheng stood up respectfully and said, “I’ve learned much.”

Xun Yuan shook his head and smiled: “These are clichés. Liu Laocheng, your talents are extraordinary; what could I possibly teach you?”

Liu Laocheng chuckled as he returned to his seat: “If it weren't for Gao Mian, I believe I would never have the opportunity to drink with you, Xun Lao Zuzu.”

Xun Yuan nodded: “Because we will never be fellow practitioners. However, that does not hinder some interaction; I acknowledge you, Liu Laocheng.”

Liu Laocheng said: “I’m honored!”

Xun Yuan suddenly said: “I plan to establish a branch of the Yuguizong in Baoping Continent within the next hundred years, with Jiang Shangzhen as the first leader. Would you be willing to serve as the chief adviser?”

Liu Laocheng was taken aback: “Does Gao Mian know about this?”

Xun Yuan shook his head: “I haven’t told him, as I regard him as a true friend, unlike you, Liu Laocheng, so we can discuss this.”

Liu Laocheng began to weigh the pros and cons.

Xun Yuan smiled and said: “Before I leave Fengwei Crossing, just give me a clear answer. Rest assured, I won’t force your hand. Besides, Liu Laocheng, you truly aren’t small potatoes.”

Liu Laocheng nodded: “Allow me to consider this for a bit.”

Even a celestial being like Xun Yuan, who wielded mighty powers, would never know that this small action of his would lead the young maidservant named Shi Qiu to face a series of slaps from the fairy, who had explicitly told her she could “open the painting” and would receive a share of the immortal money afterward. Shi Qiu stood there silently, enduring the fairy’s wrath. Only after the fairy vented her frustrations did she dare to wipe the blood from the corner of her mouth and return to her narrow room, shutting the door behind her, crouching down as she carefully took out a silk pouch, clenching it in her palm. With one hand tightly covering her mouth, muffled sobs seeped through her fingers.

---

In Qingtai Nation, the former Minister Liu Jingting suddenly went from being a respected leader of scholars and a refined sect leader to a figure of infamy, becoming a subject of laughter in both court and society.

Even the common folk began to relish the tales of this scholar's scandalous affairs.

Lion’s Den remained closed to visitors, and Liu Jingting never uttered a word.

Li Baozhen’s success meant that those southern-dwelling gentry lost an ostensibly “literary alliance leader” and had to seek someone else—someone who could unite and inspire the literary community of Qingtai Nation. However, Liu Jingting’s fate made many of the previously restless scholars anxious. The major families that had migrated to Qingtai Nation retreated, hoping to find a leader from within. However, this complicated the situation, as many prominent family heads had reputations equal to Liu Jingting’s. Since everyone was an outsider, who genuinely wished to be lesser than another? Who wouldn’t worry that the person they proposed would secretly seek personal gain?

In a flash, the local literary scene in Qingtai Nation was thrown into chaos, and those who had once considered supporting Liu Jingting as a puppet to balance the power of the Tang emperor in Qingtai Nation also found themselves unsettled.

That evening, Li Baozhen visited Liu Qingfeng at the county office. As they strolled under the twilight, Li Baozhen cheerfully remarked to the leaderless southern scholars, “A scholar’s rebellion, three years without success.”

Liu Qingfeng nodded in agreement, smiling.

Li Baozhen wore a broad smile.

Yet his heart was cold.

That night, after Liu Qingfeng departed, Li Baozhen quickly assessed Liu Qingfeng’s “three moves,” further refining the plans he had crafted.

The officials and servants in the hall, all dullards and fools, admired Li Baozhen endlessly, showering him with praises that were at least partly sincere.

But Li Baozhen felt increasingly cold all over.

Because he was smart enough to realize that those small flaws were deliberately left by Liu Qingfeng as leftovers.

They served as opportunities for him to establish his authority.

This was Liu Qingfeng’s wordless way of leaving room for maneuver.

As Li Baozhen left the office, he couldn’t help but glance back at the office’s archway, muttering with a smile: “Fortunately, the public office doesn’t cultivate any immortal paths.”

Just thinking of those who had genuinely admired and respected County Magistrate Liu but now looked at him with complicated expressions, feeling distant, some even struggled to conceal their pity.

Li Baozhen felt a bit of joy, quickening his steps as he exited the office.

Liu Qingfeng returned home. As he meticulously reviewed the files, he suddenly recalled the true name of Wang Yifu, the martial secretary from the Great Li, a top general from the northern Lu Dynasty in Baoping Continent, who was about to take charge of maintaining order and capturing thieves in the county. How could such a potential pillar for the Great Li’s government be reduced to a county officer in Qingtai Nation?

This thought made Liu Qingfeng chuckle to himself.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 416: The Pinnacle of Humanity

The Emperor of the Gao clan from the Great Sui dynasty attended the Thousand Elder Feast. The envoy from the Great Li was none other than the former Deputy Minister of Rites, Chen Ping'an would surely recognize him at a glance if he were present.

In a banquet filled with gray-haired elders, sitting beside the Great Li's Deputy Minister were Song Jixin and Xu Ruo, both using aliases, while Zhi Gui remained out of sight.

Xu Ruo was still dressed as a wandering swordsman, with a sword slung across his back.

Perhaps only the young embroidered tiger knew what a significant matter Xu Ruo had undertaken.

Facing Mr. Fan directly, he had promised on behalf of the Great Li's Song clan that they would intervene in this grand feast sweeping across the continent, allowing it to flourish without interference for thirty years.

As Xu Ruo sipped his wine, he pondered not the grand schemes of power, but rather how to nurture Dong Shuijing, who still bought wontons every day, into a true bladesmith.

Song Jixin looked at the Emperor of the Great Sui and then glanced around, feeling a deep sense of stagnation in both the court and the common folk.

Zhi Gui, or Wang Zhu, stayed behind in the desolate post station.

A tall, thin middle-aged Taoist, using concealment magic to hide his true appearance, arrived quietly at the post station with two disciples from Zhenwu Mountain, finding Zhi Gui leaning against the railing, listening to the sound of wind chimes.

The middle-aged Taoist dispelled his magic, revealing a celestial aura, wearing a fish-tail crown. Just standing in the courtyard, he carried an air of profound existence, as if he were a great mountain standing between heaven and earth.

Zhi Gui merely cast a glance at this Daoist Lord Qi Zhen, the head of the Daoist lineage of Baopingzhou, and didn't even look at the Zhenwu Mountain swordsman beside him. Her attention was drawn more to the young man with a black cat perched on his shoulder. He seemed gentle and quiet, reminiscent of the fool from Xinghua Alley in her memory. He appeared quite delicate, his complexion slightly pale, looking at her with a warm smile that concealed a burning desire for possession in the depths of his eyes.

Zhi Gui didn't particularly like this guy, not out of any personal grudge, but because of his grandmother, Ma Kuxuan’s grandmother, who was utterly detestable. It seemed all the bad habits that ordinary market women should have were concentrated in that old hag. Every time Zhi Gui went to fetch water from the Iron Lock Well and encountered that woman, she would have to endure a few spiteful remarks. If Zhi Gui hadn’t been so strictly bound by the rules of Lizhu Cave, she would have had a hundred ways to make that long-tongued old woman wish she were dead. Later, when Old Yang lost his mind and actually bestowed fortune upon the old hag, turning her into the river goddess of the local Longxu River, Zhi Gui could only bide her time. One day, she would make that woman, whose real name was Ma Lanhua, experience the taste of hell on earth.

As for what would happen to Ma Kuxuan then, did she care? Not in the slightest.

Qi Zhen smiled and said, “Miss Zhi Gui, I’ve accomplished what Master Lu instructed me to do. The God’s Precept Sect has just acquired a brand-new broken blessed land. I welcome Miss Zhi Gui to seek opportunities there, and I will ensure your safety throughout the journey.”

Tracing back to the origin, Qi Zhen belonged to the Daoist lineage of Dao Old Two, but Lu Chen was one of the three great masters, now based in Baiyu Capital. Qi Zhen was overjoyed to do something for Lu Chen, and he was certain that catching the eye of Master Lu would mean he had a bright future in ascending to higher realms. When Qi Zhen was young, he had received a prophecy from a transcendent being, saying, “Even immortals need to find sustenance.” Before reaching the twelfth realm, it was a good omen; however, once Qi Zhen reached the realm of the Celestial Lord, it would be akin to walking to the end and slowly waiting for death. Master Lu was known to be one of the few great figures who liked to alter the fates of those he favored, and it was said that Master Lu particularly enjoyed the four great leisurely pursuits, one of which was carving rotten wood.

Ma Kuxuan’s eyes were only on her, smiling at the girl he had long admired, “You don’t need to trouble the Celestial Lord; I can handle it myself.”

Zhi Gui ignored the Daoist Celestial Lord entirely, not even adjusting her posture, continuing to lazily lean her head toward Ma Kuxuan. “So, you’re the fortuitous encounter that Lu Chen promised me? Does that mean I can command you from now on?”

When Lu Chen had set up his fortune-telling booth and met the Emperor and Song Jixin of the Great Li, he had gone to Mud Bottle Alley alone and found her, saying that by a small scheme, he had received a favorable response from Song Zhengchun, who told him to “let it go,” which allowed him to smoothly bring Ma Kuxuan into the fold. Lu Chen intended to gift Ma Kuxuan to Zhi Gui.

Zhi Gui didn’t care much for the backstory; she didn’t pay it much mind at first because she didn’t think a Ma Kuxuan could be of much use. Only later, when Ma Kuxuan gained fame in Zhenwu Mountain and broke through his realms twice with ease, did she realize that perhaps Ma Kuxuan, though not one of the five, might still hold some secrets. Zhi Gui didn’t want to think too much about it; having an extra blade in her hand was not a bad thing. Currently, aside from the old Longcheng Fu family, she had no one else to command freely.

Ma Kuxuan nodded, “I’ll do whatever you say. Just tell me who you want to kill. As long as it’s not a top-tier old turtle in the fifth realm, I promise to bring back their head. As for those in the fifth realm, just wait a bit; it’ll be possible later too, and it shouldn’t take long.”

Because he liked Zhi Gui, Ma Kuxuan had endured plenty of nagging from his grandmother back in Xinghua Alley.

In this matter alone, his doting grandmother had scolded him a few times.

Zhi Gui asked, “So, can you kill Chen Ping’an?”

The Zhenwu Mountain protector’s heart tightened, and he said in a deep voice, “Impossible.”

Zhi Gui merely stared at Ma Kuxuan.

Ma Kuxuan smiled, “At the Shuyuan Academy, there’s a Sage presiding. I can’t kill Chen Ping’an. But you could give me a time limit, like a year or three. However, to be honest, if the rumors are true, the current Chen Ping’an isn’t easy to kill, unless…”

Zhi Gui interrupted Ma Kuxuan directly, “Then forget it. It seems you’re not that impressive after all. Lu Chen isn’t very generous; gifting a Celestial Lord’s descendant to me is just that foolish Longmei. When it comes to me, it’s so petty.”

The Zhenwu Mountain soldier feared that Ma Kuxuan would get angry hearing this, but when he secretly probed his heart lake with a secret technique, he found it calm as a mirror, even reflecting some glimmers of joy.

Ma Kuxuan grinned brightly, “Wang Zhu, just wait; there will come a day when you will know that I am the best. Those priceless celestial weapons, those favored sons of heaven, when the time comes and you look back, they’ll all be rubbish and ants.”

Zhi Gui was somewhat curious, “What do you like about me? In the small town, we hardly interacted. I can’t recall much; we may not have even spoken.”

Ignored and neglected, Ma Kuxuan still managed to impress even the ancestors of Zhenwu Mountain. He showed an unprecedented bashfulness but didn’t provide an answer.

Zhi Gui suddenly laughed, pointing at Ma Kuxuan, “Aren’t you, Ma Kuxuan, the most famous favored son of heaven in Baopingzhou right now?”

Ma Kuxuan’s lips curled up, and in an instant, he transformed back into the familiar haughty cultivator, exceptionally talented, causing his peers to despair, making old cultivators feel as if they had lived centuries as dogs. The key was that Ma Kuxuan had repeatedly descended the mountain to hone his skills, engaging in decisive battles on Zhenwu Mountain, brutally and bloodily determining life and death, always rooting out the problem, never sparing even those in the right or wrong.

Ma Kuxuan slowly said, “I’m not a favored son of heaven.”

The black cat perched on his shoulder curled up, raising a paw to lick itself, exceptionally docile.

Zhi Gui gave him a glance and pouted, “Suit yourself.”

Ma Kuxuan asked, “If one day I kill Song Jixin, would you be angry?”

Zhi Gui seemed a bit annoyed, glaring at him, “Ma Kuxuan, please, before you have any real power, try to say less big talk. It’s really quite irritating.”

Ma Kuxuan chuckled, “I’ll listen to you.”

Watching Ma Kuxuan grow step by step, the Zhenwu Mountain protector felt quite complicated.

Celestial Lord Qi Zhen was indifferent to all this.

He stood patiently in place out of respect for Master Lu, who had returned to Baiyu Capital, observing these juniors chit-chatting as if playing house.

Regardless of Zhi Gui and Ma Kuxuan’s respective identities, as long as they didn’t ascend to the fifth realm, they were just two exquisite porcelain figurines that could shatter at any moment.

Ma Kuxuan lamented, “I’m about to head to the Zhu Ying Dynasty to kill a few Earth Immortal sword cultivators as a breakthrough opportunity.”

Zhi Gui nonchalantly remarked, “I don’t care where you go.”

Ma Kuxuan laughed heartily, turning to Qi Zhen, “Then please, Celestial Lord, take us out of the city.”

Qi Zhen nodded, saying a few words to Zhi Gui before their figures vanished.

In the Great Sui Capital, the grand formation remained unaware of any anomaly.

It was as if entering a world devoid of people.

Perhaps only the Great Li Capital would make this Celestial Lord feel a bit apprehensive.

Zhi Gui leaned on the railing, feeling slightly drowsy. She closed her eyes, idly scratching the railing with a slender fingernail, producing a creaking sound.

She turned around, leaning against the railing, tilting her head back, her figure curvaceous.

She bent her fingers, repeatedly flicking them, causing the wind chimes below to chime softly.

In the twilight,

She opened her golden slit-like eyes.

The strange phenomenon faded away.

She stood up, tall and graceful, smiling toward the courtyard gate.

Song Jixin walked into the courtyard, a faint scent of alcohol wafting from him.

She asked, “Did you enjoy the Thousand Elder Feast?”

Song Jixin shook his sleeves, sighing, “Those old geezers at the banquet would love nothing more than to flay us alive, terrifying me to death.”

Zhi Gui asked curiously, “Didn’t you sign a hundred-year alliance? We have no grievances with them. Our Great Li Iron Cavalry didn’t even pass by their doorstep, heading straight south. Why are they so unfriendly?”

Song Jixin leaned against the railing, pondering for a moment, “They’ve gotten used to good days; they can’t stand the slightest grievance.”

Zhi Gui exclaimed in realization, “I see! Then I’m much better tempered than them.”

Song Jixin misunderstood her remark as referring to some minor neighborhood disputes from years ago, laughing, “Once I make a name for myself, I’ll definitely help you vent your frustrations.”

Zhi Gui hummed in agreement, asking, “So, have you figured out the gist of those three books yet?”

Song Jixin, feeling somewhat exhausted, closed his eyes, rubbing his cheeks, “Maybe they’re just ordinary books, making me paranoid for so long.”

Suddenly, Song Jixin reached into his sleeve and pulled out a seemingly ordinary, yellowish four-legged snake, casually tossing it on the ground. “At the Thousand Elder Feast, it kept fidgeting. If it weren’t for Xu Ruo suppressing it with sword intent, it would have lunged at the Great Sui Emperor and bitten his head off for a midnight snack.”

The maid crouched down, taking out a Gu Yu coin and placing it in her palm.

That four-legged snake shrank back, not daring to gobble up the delicacy.

Song Jixin bent down, looking at the little creature with horns sprouting from its head, helplessly saying, “Look at you, what a coward! And then look at that water dragon from the Book Scroll Lake—what a world of difference.”

Song Jixin no longer cared about it, yawning and heading inside to sleep.

Zhi Gui shook her hand, but the four-legged snake still didn’t dare approach.

“Good for you, being so perceptive.”

Zhi Gui smiled and tossed the Gu Yu coin into her mouth, the little creature seemed somewhat aggrieved, letting out a faint whine.

Zhi Gui clenched her fist and struck it on the head, “Three years without opening a shop, when you do, you eat for three years—don’t you get it?”

She stood up and kicked the four-legged snake into the courtyard. “You have no skills at all yet dare to covet the National Master’s ancient relic? Just drooling over it is one thing, but getting caught in the act—how did I end up with such a useless thing?”

Zhi Gui sat on the steps, taking off one of her embroidered shoes and beckoning to the little creature.

The little thing obediently came to her feet, and still sulking, she picked up her embroidered shoe and began to swat the little creature.

---

On the Piyun Mountain in Longquan County, a new academy named Linlu Academy was established, where Prince Gao Xuan of the Great Sui was studying. Both the Great Sui and Great Li sides did not deliberately conceal this fact.

This was Gao Xuan’s second visit to Longquan County; the first time was in the sky, needing to traverse a heavenly ladder in Lizhu Cave, while this time he was on the ground, in the true territory of the Great Li.

Piyun Mountain was now the northern peak of the Great Li, the mountain was new, and so was the academy. From the teachers imparting knowledge to the young scholars seeking it, everything was fresh.

Linlu Academy was organized by the Great Li court and did not hold the title of one of the seventy-two academies. The mountain’s head and deputy head were not well-known, and one of them was a former old minister of the Huangting Kingdom, a vassal of the Great Sui. However, everyone knew that Linlu Academy was definitely aiming for the “seventy-two,” as the Great Li’s Song clan was determined to obtain it.

At first, Gao Xuan thought there would surely be many conflicts in the academy, at least some disdainful glares or subtle probing, similar to what Li Baoping and Yu Lu had faced at the Cliff Academy on Donghua Mountain. However, after spending a few months at Linlu Academy, he felt somewhat disappointed because it seemed that from the teachers to the students, they did not regard him, the enemy prince, with much attention. Almost no one displayed obvious hostility.

Gao Xuan puzzled over this for quite a while until he was enlightened by an elder from the Gao clan who had built a hut and was cultivating at Piyun Mountain.

In just over a century, the Great Li dynasty had grown from a vassal of the Lu clan to the northern hegemon of Baopingzhou, evolving from a muddy quagmire of eunuchs and external relatives seizing power. During this period, there had been constant wars, deaths, and the annexation of neighboring countries. Even the common folk of the Great Li Capital came from all directions, lacking the social status that many held in the Great Sui court. How were their ancestors two or three hundred years ago?

Gao Xuan understood; flowing water doesn’t rot, and a door hinge won’t decay.

But the elder Gao, who had previously mingled in the streets of the Great Sui Capital as a storyteller, sighed, “Flowing water? It should be flowing blood.”

Whenever Gao Xuan had free time, he would shoulder his book box and wander the western mountains of Longquan County or stroll through the small town, or visit the newly built county town in the north. He would even take a slight detour to a northern road with a mountain god temple to eat a bowl of wontons. The shopkeeper, Dong Shui Jing, was a tall young man who treated him kindly. As they got to know each other, they became friends. If Dong Shui Jing wasn’t busy, he would even personally cook a couple of home-style dishes, and the two would share some drinks.

Occasionally, Gao Xuan would visit an abandoned house rumored to belong to a man named Li Er, currently occupied by his wife’s relatives, who were hoping to sell it for a high price. However, it seemed he had run into walls at the county office, as there was no land deed.

Inside Gao Xuan’s book box, there was a Dragon King basket.

Every day, he would infuse small summer coins into it according to the secret techniques passed down by his ancestors, making the spiritual energy inside dense as water.

Inside the bamboo-woven fish basket, a golden carp swam lazily.

That was when Gao Xuan first met Li Er, and of course, Chen Ping’an.

Before arriving here, Gao Xuan had mentally prepared himself, knowing that one day he might have to hand over the Dragon King basket and the golden carp to some powerful figure in the Great Li dynasty as the price for ensuring his stable studies at Linlu Academy.

However, to this day, even the county magistrate and the military governor of Wu had not come to see him.

That day, Gao Xuan was squatting by a stream, washing his face when he suddenly turned his head and saw a handsome young man in a snow-white robe, adorned with a golden earring.

Gao Xuan quickly stood up, bowing respectfully, “Gao Xuan greets the Northern Peak Deity.”

The Northern Peak Deity of the Great Li, Wei Bo, smiled, “No need to be so polite. I’ve noticed you’ve been wandering around; carrying the Dragon King basket everywhere isn’t practical. If you trust me, why not open the basket and let that golden carp swim in the stream, nurturing it in this living water? Using spiritual energy as water is a dead nurturing method. Over time, it will lose its spirituality. In the short term, it will ascend quickly, but it will be blocked at the Nascent Soul realm. On the other hand, letting it swim freely will allow it to absorb spiritual energy; although it may be slower in progress, in the long run, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.”

Wei Bo pointed to the distance, “From here to the Longxu River and then to the Tiefu River, it can move freely. I will speak with the two river goddesses and the river deity, ensuring its cultivation isn’t hindered.”

Gao Xuan hesitated a bit.

He had never interacted with this Northern Peak Deity of the Great Li and wasn’t sure if he could trust him.

The golden carp in the basket was regarded by his ancestors as having the potential to leap over the Dragon Gate in the Middle Lands and become a true dragon.

On the path of the Dao, human hearts are subtle, and countless schemes abound.

If someone were to seize this great opportunity, Gao Xuan, having already been a guest in someone else’s house, would have to accept it. Accepting it meant recognizing the trend, which would only further solidify his own resolve. Adversity can often sharpen character.

But if he fell into someone’s scheme and lost the fortunes that already belonged to him, it would not only cost him a golden carp but would also leave gaps and flaws in his own path to immortality.

Wei Bo smiled, “There’s no hurry; whenever you come to a conclusion, you can let it go.”

Wei Bo was about to turn and leave when Gao Xuan’s ancestor suddenly swooped down from Piyun Mountain, appearing beside him, and said, “Just listen to Mr. Wei. It’s all benefits with no harm.”

Seeing his ancestor appear, Gao Xuan no longer hesitated. He opened the bamboo box, took out the Dragon King basket, and released the golden carp into the stream.

The golden carp swam off happily with a flick of its tail.

Gao Xuan squatted by the water, holding the empty basket, murmuring, “After long confinement, returning to nature.”

---

Years ago, Zhao Yao left Lizhu Cave in a bull cart as per his grandfather’s arrangement, heading to a sect near the western sea in central Baopingzhou to cultivate.

However, midway, he encountered a boy with a mole on his forehead, who called himself Embroidered Tiger.

In the end, Zhao Yao handed over the spring character seal given by his master, as the other party was the National Master of the Great Li, Cui Zhan.

Among his generation in the town’s school, Zhao Yao had spent the most time accompanying his master. Li Baoping’s children and his peer, Song Jixin, whom Zhao Yao greatly admired, were not as close to him in this regard.

Zhao Yao traveled extensively, relying on the secret cultivation methods and two celestial items gifted to him by Cui Zhan, always managing to avert disaster.

However, just as Zhao Yao approached that celestial cave, the bull cart had reached the foot of the mountain. Zhao Yao, exhausted and spiritless, suddenly changed his mind, freeing the water buffalo and continuing alone toward the western sea. Eventually, he found a legendary celestial ferry, boarding a boat to the isolated immortal island suspended offshore, and then transferring to another boat heading toward the Central Continent, as the entire Baopingzhou had only one intercontinental boat service from the old Longcheng, mostly operated by the merchants of the Inverted Mountain. Therefore, for cultivators in Baopingzhou wanting to reach the Central Continent, they could only follow Zhao Yao’s example, repeatedly using the short-distance ferries of the sea’s celestial sects.

However, halfway through the journey, the ferry Zhao Yao was on encountered a calamity, being rammed by a horde of flying fish, causing the boat to splinter. Zhao Yao, along with most of the passengers, fell into the sea, some dying on the spot. Zhao Yao escaped with a protective treasure, but the vast sea seemed to spell doom, and he was bound to be fish fodder sooner or later.

Two Golden Core cultivators on the ferry attempted to use wind to flee. One tried to break through the formation of flying fish and met a tragic end, crushed to pieces, while the other, sensing misfortune, exhausted, could only drop down and hide in the water.

Sitting on a piece of the ferry’s wreckage, Zhao Yao was tightly bound and didn’t know how long he drifted. His appearance was emaciated, feeling worse than death.

Finally, unable to hold on, he fainted and fell into the sea, relying on the last bit of spiritual light from his protective treasure to drift along with the current.

When Zhao Yao groggily opened his eyes, he found himself lying on a bed, awakening with a start to see a simple but spacious thatched cottage, its walls bare, filled with yellowed books that nearly blocked his movement.

After rising, Zhao Yao found that his wrapped package was at the head of the bed; upon opening it, everything inside was intact. He breathed a sigh of relief.

Following the narrow path through the “mountain of books,” Zhao Yao stepped out of the cottage. Pushing the door open, he was met with a vast view of the sea, finding that the cottage was built on the edge of a cliff, allowing for a direct view of the ocean.

Zhao Yao noticed a sword without a sheath, rusted and dull, leaning on the mountain top.

He approached the cliff’s edge, staring blankly into the abyss below.

Just as Zhao Yao was about to take a step forward, a warm voice rang out, “The heavens do not completely close off paths for people. Are you really going to give up on yourself?”

With tears in his eyes, Zhao Yao turned to see a tall man in a green robe gazing out at the sea.

Young Zhao Yao, still naïve, wiped his tears and suddenly asked, “You must be a transcendent being; will you accept me as a disciple? I want to learn celestial techniques!”

The man shook his head, smiling, “I’ve never taken a disciple nor do I wish to. It’s too troublesome. You should recuperate here, and I’ll send you on your way.”

Zhao Yao inquired, “Where is this place?”

The man smiled, “The human realm, where else could it be?”

At that moment, Zhao Yao, feeling desperate and hopeless, bluntly asked, “I want to know, where exactly in the human realm is this?!”

The man remained unperturbed, smiling, “I’m not trying to be cryptic. This is just an ordinary nameless place, not some immortal abode. The spiritual energy is thin, not far from the Central Continent. If you’re lucky, you might encounter fishermen or pearl divers.”

Afterward, Zhao Yao settled down there, recuperating. As time passed, he found that the man, despite being quite capable, was actually quite ordinary.

Even though the few thatched cottages on the mountain were filled with books, the man rarely spoke profound words. He, too, needed to eat and often walked down the mountain to stroll by the sea.

Zhao Yao spent his days reading and daydreaming by the cliff’s edge.

Only on one occasion, when Zhao Yao felt restless and attempted to pull out the sword from the ground, did the man stand by his cottage, smiling and reminding him not to touch it.

Curious, Zhao Yao asked, “Does this sword have a name?”

The man shook his head, “It never had one.”

Zhao Yao pressed on, “Are you a failed scholar? Or trying to escape enemies, which is why you left land to live here in seclusion?”

The man shook his head again, “Neither. It's not as complicated as you think. I simply agree with the saying, ‘Life is difficult, and the path of the Dao is full of divergences. Since the road is hard to walk, it’s best to stop, take a break, and think it through.’”

Zhao Yao tentatively asked, “Are you really not a transcendent being, like a land immortal in the Golden Core or Nascent Soul realm?”

The man smiled and countered, “I certainly am not a land immortal, and whether I am or not has nothing to do with you, Zhao Yao.”

Having lived there for nearly two years, the island was not very large. Zhao Yao could explore it independently and, as the man had said, if he was lucky, he could meet fishermen or pearl divers, albeit with significant risks.

Zhao Yao’s mindset grew more stable. He eventually spoke up, expressing his desire to travel to the Central Continent.

The man nodded with a smile, “Be careful on the road, and remember not to give up on yourself again; that might be the greatest disappointment.”

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Zhao Yao eventually pulled out a wooden dragon-shaped paperweight, “To repay you for saving my life, I want to give this to you.”

The man waved his hand, seemingly exasperated, “Has the world become so morally high that saving someone is considered a matter of course?”

Zhao Yao insisted, “But you saved me without seeking repayment, and I cannot be ungrateful! This is the most important thing I possess, and it’s just right to use it to repay you!”

The man smiled broadly, “That shows the world hasn’t turned too terrible after all.”

But in the end, the man still did not accept the paperweight.

Zhao Yao set off on a makeshift wooden raft, sailing toward the land. Standing on the raft, he bowed to the man on the shore in farewell.

After that, the man continued his leisurely life.

One day, the sword on the mountain peak trembled slightly.

The man stood beside the sword, gazing toward Baopingzhou, smiling, “It’s better not to dig into the old history.”

The sword's trembling gradually ceased.

Then, two visitors suddenly appeared on the island: an old man with a wine-stained nose and a young Taoist, the latter quickly crouching down to vomit.

From the alley of a village in the southeast of Baopingzhou to the western coast, and then to a lonely island of a sect in the sea, the young Taoist had thrown up again and again.

The old man hurriedly crouched down, gently patting his disciple's back, apologizing, “It’s alright, it’s alright. After this round… if you throw up once more, uh, it might be twice, then we’ll get through it.”

The young Taoist nearly vomited up his bile, his eyes red as he asked, “Master, you say this every time. When will it end? Can you give me a definite answer?”

The old man in the strange Taoist robe, with sleeves like a fire dragon, smiled awkwardly.

The young Taoist stood up and asked, “Master, you said you’d introduce me to someone you admire. Why won’t you tell me about him?”

The old man smiled without speaking, looking up and asking, “Can we trouble you to open the door and offer us a cup of tea?”

The man sighed, appearing by the sea, standing a distance away from the master and disciple, “I’m just a scholar, and you’re a great celestial master from Longhu Mountain. Are you really going to challenge me on magic and talismans?”

The old man had already used his powers to ensure his disciple wouldn’t hear what the man said.

Some matters still needed to be kept secret from this foolish disciple.

The short old man chuckled, “Not even letting us in? Are you saying you’ve already agreed to compete with me on the Dao? If we can get in, even if I lose, you’ll lend me that sword?”

The man shook his head, “Do you really want to be so persistent?”

The young Taoist, Zhang Shan Feng, couldn’t hear the man’s words.

In fact, Zhang Shan Feng was startled to find that he forgot the man’s face the moment he saw it.

The old man laughed heartily, “Oh, are you angry? If you’re capable, come out and hit me!”

The man twitched his lips.

Zhang Shan Feng suddenly heard his master’s shameless words and couldn’t help but whisper, “Master, even though you always deem yourself as a person who has achieved the Dao, as a mountain cultivator visiting, you should still pay attention to some etiquette and grace, right?”

The old man nodded repeatedly in agreement, then glared at the man, “Using such tricks, what kind of hero are you!”

The man said, “You can’t even draw that sword; how can you borrow it?”

The old man’s expression grew serious, “With my current realm, I still can’t draw it?”

The man nodded, “No matter how much higher your realm goes, you still won’t be able to control it.”

The old man sighed heavily.

There was a secret matter that had once occurred on Longhu Mountain.

The old man had promised the previous great celestial master that he could only return to Longhu Mountain if he killed that ascended demon. 

Now, the odds were 80-20 in his favor, and he felt confident, but if it came to life and death, the odds were only 50-50.

The old man glanced at his most promising disciple, determined to try.

The man suddenly looked at the young Taoist, “What’s your intention behind that punch?”

Zhang Shan Feng, carrying a common peach wood sword and a damaged ancient sword inscribed with “Zhenwu,” was puzzled by the man’s question.

The old man proudly said, “What do you think? It’s my disciple’s own creation!”

The man showed a rare glimmer of appreciation, “It might just pave a new path in the world of martial arts, possibly evolving into many merits. Moreover, what’s more rare is the sincerity within his heart; you’ve taken on a good disciple.”

The old man grinned widely, starting to boast, “Not at all; it’s just average. I have at least seven or eight disciples like him.”

Zhang Shan Feng didn’t think his master was exaggerating or felt disheartened. In the past, while cultivating on the mountain, he truly was the one with the most average talent, far behind his senior brothers and sisters, even some junior disciples who were only his master’s apprentices…

The man smiled, “I’ve heard about the events of Longhu Mountain back in the day. You plan to bring this disciple to pay respects to the ancestors, which is easier said than done. Coincidentally, that demon has indeed crossed the line.”

The man thought for a moment, “Wait for me to light a stick of incense.”

He turned and headed up the mountain.

The man casually grasped the sword leaning on the mountain peak.

This scholar, who only acknowledged himself as a scholar, showed no exuberance, even after pulling out the long sword that the great celestial master couldn’t draw, without causing any celestial phenomena.

He was like any impoverished scholar, sitting in a study, picking up a pen, trying to write an essay of just a few characters.

He ventured into an abyss that no one in the Central Continent dared to enter, and with one sword, he annihilated the thirteenth realm demon lurking at the bottom.

Returning to the mountain peak, he reinserted the rusted long sword into the ground, walked down the mountain, and said to the old man, “Now you can ascend Longhu Mountain.”

The old man grinned broadly, “How embarrassing; such a great favor! Thank you, we’ll be on our way now, and we’ll come again in the future.”

Pulling along the bewildered Zhang Shan Feng, with a stroke of his foot, they shrank thousands of miles away, arriving at a high mountain in the inland of the Central Continent.

The man didn’t mind, standing in place, continuing to gaze at the sea.

At that time, young Zhao Yao, naive and ignorant, had asked him if he was a failed person.

That question was indeed interesting.

Because this scholar had always been regarded as the most accomplished person in the human realm.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 417: If Life Were Not Joyful

Three moons hung in the sky.

This was a sight that could never be seen in the vast realm of Haoran.

The pure white moonlight poured generously onto the earth, illuminating the mountainous expanse of over a hundred thousand peaks as if they were draped in thick snow.

Yet, amidst the endless mountain ranges, a rustling sound echoed, easily traveling hundreds of miles.

If an immortal were to leisurely ride the winds above the sea of clouds and gaze down, they might see towering golden-armored puppets, as tall as the mountains themselves, laboriously moving the great peaks, slowly traversing the land.

There were also some ancient ferocious beasts, their bodies stretching a thousand feet long, covered in scars and wounds, all driven by the golden-armored puppets wielding long whips, forced into hard labor, tirelessly dragging the mountains.

Occasionally, some weary creatures of the wilderness would find a moment to rest, using the peaks as pillows, falling into deep slumber. The innate ferocity that once resided within them had long been worn down by endless hardship.

This scene could only be passed down through word of mouth in this world, growing more distorted with each retelling, far removed from the truth.

For no one dared to fly above these mountains.

Throughout history, there had indeed been some powerful demons at the fifth realm who refused to believe the warnings, only to be dragged down by countless golden-armored puppets, ultimately becoming part of the suffering laborers, their massive skeletons entombed within the mountains, unable to reincarnate.

Atop one of these peaks stood a dilapidated thatched hut, behind which lay a rare patch of greenery—a vegetable garden. The hut was surrounded by a crooked wooden fence, and a bony watchdog lay at the entrance, breathing lightly.

A frail old man stood in the open space outside the door, facing the mountains, scratching his cheek in deep thought.

Suddenly, the skinny dog leaped up and bolted out, barking fiercely in a particular direction.

A torrent of powerful wind surged forth, ripping apart a thick layer of dark clouds that concealed one of the bright moons.

The old man remained unmoved.

As the clouds dissipated, golden-armored puppets rose from the ground around the mountains, wielding exaggerated weapons that matched their size, including long spears made from the white bones of ancient beasts.

One of the golden-armored puppets hurled a bone spear skyward, and the thunderous sound echoed as if it carried the might of creation.

The spear shot towards two tiny figures far off in the heavens.

The two visitors from afar appeared in human form.

One of them was a tall elder, clad in a bright red robe that rippled as if stirred by a rolling sea of blood. Faint, grotesque faces seemed to emerge from the fabric, attempting to reach out, only to vanish quickly, swallowed by the blood.

This burly old man wore a mysterious black belt adorned with fragments of long swords.

Beside him stood a young man with a youthful face, two long swords hanging at his sides, and a white sword case slung across his back, revealing the hilts of three swords.

As the spear was about to pierce the sky, the young man's gaze was ablaze—not directed at the spear but at the old man atop the mountain, who had his back turned to them.

The imposing spear was merely glanced at by the red-robed elder before it shattered into powder, scattering in all directions.

The other projectiles flew in the same manner, all shattering before they could approach.

The red-robed elder's expression flickered with anger, not because of the thwarted assault but because he was incensed at the old man's dismissive hospitality. He felt the elder was belittling them; at least, he should let the golden-armored puppets release the old comrades trapped underground.

With a cold sneer, the red-robed elder said, “Old blind man, have you forgotten who the master is after staying on someone else's turf for too long? You think these little tricks will amuse me?!”

With a swift motion, he slapped the ground, sending one of the golden-armored puppets crashing into the earth, dust flying.

He continued his assault, causing a series of explosive sounds as the towering golden-armored puppets vanished without a trace.

The short old man at the mountain peak turned his head, “looking” at the two towering demons standing at the pinnacle of this world.

His eye sockets were empty, resembling two pitch-black abysses.

This tiny old man, referred to as the old blind man, continued scratching his cheek.

In theory, if the same cultivators of the thirteenth realm, or those few hidden at the fourteenth realm, were to bicker among themselves, unless an outsider brought unreasonable weapons, they would typically remain undefeated in their own territory. Such items, even when combined, could be counted on one hand; aside from four swords, there might be a white jade capital, a string of Buddhist beads, or a book. Generally, in their domain, they were practically invincible, even capable of killing one another.

Especially after ascending to the first layer of the lost second realm, if one were to indulge aimlessly and roam elsewhere, they would inevitably face the suppression of the world’s principles. This was the most “natural” occurrence.

However, in this vast world, there are always a few exceptions, which is not surprising.

Like this old blind man, an outsider to the wilderness realm, yet he lived more freely than the master of the house.

And then there was that arrogant figure from Haoran.

The old blind man rasped, “It’d be better to have that fellow come for a chat; as for the two of you, if you stand any higher, I won’t hold back.”

The “young man” with five swords laughed softly.

As the youngest demon sword cultivator at the fifth realm, he had participated in a world-shaking battle and even defeated a sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall, forcing the latter to become one of the gatekeepers of the Hanging Mountain.

He recognized that the old blind man was indeed formidable, but not to the point of being uncontrollable.

The red-robed elder's expression fluctuated, his fierce aura almost causing the flow of time around them to stagnate.

In the end, he merely snorted coldly and turned to leave.

The young sword immortal, whose battle achievements were remarkable, hesitated slightly as anxious words echoed in his heart, “Let’s go!”

In an instant, a powerful force pulled at the young sword cultivator.

Just as he was about to seize the opportunity to strike at the old blind man, he found the red-robed elder roaring in anger, grabbing his shoulder and throwing him into the sky.

Then, with a wave of his sleeve, a torrential river of blood surged forth, attempting to sever the young sword cultivator’s connection with the energy aimed at him.

The world twisted as the energies tangled.

Sensing the suffocating pressure of the principles of the universe weighing down on him, the red-robed elder's expression changed slightly. He swung his sleeve vigorously, and rivers of blood began to coalesce into a massive lake, glaring as he warned, “Old blind man, do you believe I can destroy these hundred thousand mountains?”

The old blind man ceased his scratching.

At that moment, a commanding voice resonated throughout this vast “little world,” declaring, “Enough.”

The red-robed elder, fuming, stopped his actions, retracting his powers as the rivers of blood returned to his sleeve.

The old blind man reached out and yanked the young sword immortal down to his side, squatting down. The young demon, his face filled with horror, found himself unable to move. The old blind man plucked an eyeball from his socket, chewed it, then turned and spat it on the ground, where it was quickly devoured by the bony old dog that had been drooling at the scene.

The old blind man stood up, using his foot to kick the sword immortal, who was missing an eye, into the air. “This is only because of your face.”

Silence descended upon the world once more.

The old blind man placed his hands behind his back and walked toward the courtyard gate, glancing at the old dog. He sneered, “A dog can’t change its nature.”

He then resumed scratching his cheek, turning back toward the cliff's edge, feeling that some parts of this painted scene needed editing.

He stood there for a while.

Suddenly, the old blind man frowned, hesitating for a moment before moving his fingers, causing the golden-armored puppets that had risen to their feet to settle back down.

The next guests were an elder and a young woman from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The old blind man turned to the weary young woman and forced a smile that even he found awkward, likely appearing terrifying to anyone who saw it.

He then turned to the old man and shouted angrily, “Chen Qingdu, don’t bother me! This time, I won’t help anyone!”

The elder from the Sword Qi Great Wall, the great sword immortal, Chen Qingdu.

Chen Qingdu asked, “Are you still human?”

The old blind man answered, “You should ask your own heart, are we still human?”

Chen Qingdu nodded, “I am.”

The old blind man fell silent for a moment and then asked, “In all the chaos between the two realms, can it compare to the past? In the end, it merely shatters that one even more. It was like this back then, and what will it change after a thousand or ten thousand years? Isn’t the world still the same mess? What’s the point? Perhaps it’s better to utterly overturn it; starting anew might be the way.”

Chen Qingdu replied, “It serves you right for being blind.”

Suddenly, the old blind man laughed, “Better than being a watchdog for others. When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog gets cooked. Is one taste not enough for you? I think the reason you and your ilk ended up in this predicament is because of people like you, Chen Qingdu. After staying here for so long, do you know why I’ve avoided looking north? I’m afraid that seeing the biggest joke in this world will make me laugh myself to death.”

The old blind man pointed at the trembling old dog at the gate. “Look at you, Chen Qingdu, how much better are you than it?”

He then turned his gaze to the young woman and rasped, “Ning girl, don’t be angry; this has nothing to do with you. You’re still quite impressive.”

Ning Yao remained silent.

Chen Qingdu quickly led Ning Yao away.

The old blind man gently sighed, losing interest in admiring the unfinished landscape painting, and walked towards the courtyard gate. Seeing the sycophantic old dog, he suddenly lifted his foot and stomped hard on its back. It whimpered and begged for mercy, but the old blind man broke its sturdy spine, knowing it would soon recover thanks to the young demon's eyeball.

Muttering to himself, the old blind man entered the courtyard.

On the wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The great sword immortal sat cross-legged, while Ning Yao drank wine.

Chen Qingdu said calmly, “You don’t need to defend me; the old blind man was the one who suffered the most back then. So it’s not as the rumors say; it wasn’t a battle with the ancestral demons of the wilderness that cost him his eyes. No, he had taken them out himself long ago—one was cast into the Haoran realm, and the other into the Qingming realm. The reason I sought him out this time was to hear him say, ‘I won’t help anyone,’ which is already quite enough.”

Ning Yao nodded.

After drinking half a jar of wine, she turned to look at the great sword immortal.

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Ning girl, I’m not talking about you; you should just go back home. This is my territory, after all; there’s no reason for you to chase people away.”

Though he said this, the old man still jumped off the wall and returned to his thatched hut.

In truth, he knew the reason; that kid had once fought on this very wall.

Ning Yao took out a scroll from her sleeve, set her wine jar aside, and then leaned on the wall, unfurling the glowing river of time. This was already the third or fourth time she had done so.

On the scroll, the scene depicted was of the celestial grave she had also visited, where a group of children were flying kites. A dark, thin child sat alone at a distance, appearing forlorn. As some children ran past him, letting their kites soar, one playfully tugged at the string of the forlorn child’s kite, then crouched down to pick up a clod of dirt and threw it at him, laughing heartily at the sight of the child who turned to run away.

Ning Yao reached out and tapped on the scroll, precisely poking the forehead of the tall child. She muttered quietly to herself.

Then she withdrew her hand and quietly finished watching the scroll.

There were actually many things within arm's reach, but she only ever viewed one scene at a time.

She turned over, resting her hands behind her head, gently swaying one leg.

Her feelings for him had nothing to do with the scrolls.

After viewing one scroll after another, her affection had only deepened.

She, Ning Yao, liked someone, and it had nothing to do with the heavens or the earth.

Chen Ping'an could train mindlessly for a million punches for her.

But was this really something remarkable?

Ning Yao opened her eyes, feeling that even if she were to die a million times, she could still continue to like him.

————

Mao Xiaodong informed Chen Ping'an that the undercurrents in the capital of the Sui Dynasty would no longer affect the Cliff Academy. Naturally, the happiest one was Li Baoping, who dragged Chen Ping'an to explore the capital. They treated their little master uncle to meals at two small eateries in a narrow alley where she often frequented, visited various scenic spots in the Sui Dynasty, and after spending a good half month, Li Baoping still insisted there were fun places yet to explore. 

However, through casual chats with Cui Dongshan, she learned that her little master uncle had just stepped into the second realm of Qi Refining, a critical period when he needed to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth day and night, so she decided to follow the custom of her hometown and “let him be.”

Thus, Chen Ping'an began his genuine training.

By utilizing the pure yang energy at specific times during the day to warm his organs and bones, he could resist the invasion of external evil and turbid energies.

At night, he absorbed the pure yin energy at certain times, focusing on nourishing the two acupoints that had already opened and housed his life’s essence.

Due to the refining of the golden literary talisman, which largely involved Confucian practices, Mao Xiaodong personally took out a poetry collection to guide Chen Ping'an, covering the most famous poems from history about the borderlands.

Learning that Chen Ping'an had traveled so far and yet had never visited even a single ancient battlefield site, only having witnessed a group of monks chanting on a battlefield in the small Lotus Blossom blessed land, she scolded him again.

The talisman for wandering the spirit was already “closed off” by Mao Xiaodong; otherwise, no matter how high the rank of the talisman was or how slow the spiritual energy dissipated, it would still not be a good thing.

As for the method to open it, after Chen Ping'an detailed the origin of the spirit talisman to Cui Dongshan, the latter went back to ponder and manage it, and it truly worked out.

Cui Dongshan shamelessly asked to flip through the “True Records of Alchemy,” offering to pay Chen Ping'an a small coin for every page he turned.

Chen Ping'an did not agree.

Pei Qian accompanied Chen Ping'an and Li Baoping on a few outings but ultimately felt more comfortable in the academy. Walking back and forth daily, coming and going from dawn to dusk, exhausted him to no end. He preferred the leisurely time spent with Li Huai in Cui Dongshan's courtyard, engaging in casual banter and playing Go. Eventually, he found an excuse to stay in the academy. Chen Ping'an also felt that Pei Qian had come such a long way, not one step less than them, so he allowed her to play around in the academy. However, he still checked her writings every day and had Zhu Lian supervise her practice of the walking stance and swordplay. As for her dedication to martial arts, Chen Ping'an wasn't overly concerned. Even if she didn't take it seriously, a single incense stick's worth of effort could still yield results.

Mao Xiaodong often chatted with Chen Ping'an, mentioning, “Law is merely a tool for governance and not the source of purity or impurity.”

She was likely worried that her younger junior brother might inadvertently delve too deeply into the Legalist path, prompting her to speak up.

Mao Xiaodong had laughed then, saying, “This saying isn’t from us Confucians. I’m not intentionally belittling Legalism to elevate Confucianism; it was said by a historically renowned Legalist official.”

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement.

In Cui Dongshan's courtyard, Pei Qian was often seen with Li Huai, flipping through those novels of chivalrous heroes. Their pace varied, leading to quarrels over whether to turn the page. Occasionally, Li Baoping would join them for a short while. However, Pei Qian and Li Huai preferred the thrilling tales of light and sword, with blood and flesh vividly depicted, filled with life and death.

Li Baoping also read these stories but was more interested in characters who might not even have names, pondering why those individuals were in the book, saying those words, or doing those things.

One day, Zhu Lian brought out a stack of his manuscript, detailing the plight of various female heroes in the stories, who suffered at the hands of both renowned figures and nameless foes. After secretly reading it, Yu Lu was astonished.

Zhu Lian felt Yu Lu was truly his kindred spirit, deeply connected.

In Cui Dongshan's study, ancient paintings brimming with ethereal charm were stacked high, depicting chirping birds, fragrant flowers, fresh rain on quiet mountains, and an old man fishing on a chilly river.

That same night, he unwittingly “overdecorated” the famous paintings with doodles, ruining the aesthetics.

For example, Pei Qian drew a crooked birdcage for the birds in one painting, inspired by the cage belonging to a certain Miss Liu from the Qianlian Kingdom.

Li Huai, beside the solitary fisherman in a straw hat, depicted a monster fish larger than the boat itself.

Upon seeing this, Cui Dongshan wasn’t angry.

One day, Cui Dongshan took out an eccentric court painting, a “Skeleton Ghosts Cooling Off,” and with a contented demeanor, claimed it would broaden Pei Qian's horizons.

Pei Qian examined it closely, but suddenly, one of the skeletons grew large, nearly bursting out of the painting. Pei Qian was so frightened that her spirit almost fled, and she could only sit in place, silently crying.

When she finally saw Chen Ping'an, she merely pursed her lips.

As a result, Chen Ping'an chased Cui Dongshan, raining punches and kicks upon him, cursing loudly, even letting slip dialect from his hometown in Longquan County. He grabbed a broom and slammed it on Cui Dongshan’s head, who then fell to the ground, playing dead, narrowly escaping a disaster.

Cui Dongshan occasionally spoke of serious matters.

One day, a group began discussing the topic of human lifespan, and Cui Dongshan smiled, “You should know that snakes shed their skins, right? Growing up in the countryside, you must have seen plenty.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, and so did Li Baoping, Pei Qian, and Li Huai.

Cui Dongshan grinned, “If we consider the soul as the essence, while the skin, flesh, and bones are mere clothing, then how many 'human skin garments' does a common person replace in their lifetime if they live to sixty?”

Pei Qian found this notion somewhat chilling.

Cui Dongshan extended a finger.

Pei Qian's eyes widened. “Ten?”

Li Baoping frowned, “A hundred?”

Li Huai, purely to stir the pot, brazenly declared, “A thousand!”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “In a lifetime, a person unknowingly changes a thousand 'human skin garments.'”

He continued, “Coupled with the acupoints that are inextricably linked with the principles of heaven and earth, it’s no wonder that when living beings become spirits, they wish to take on human forms.”

“Your hometown's dragon kilns produce porcelain that’s clearly fragile and prone to breakage; why does His Majesty still command the crafting of these? Why not just use the clay from the mountains or sturdier pottery?”

Li Huai grinned, “Because it's beautiful and valuable. Cui Dongshan, how could you ask such a foolish question?”

Cui Dongshan retorted, “Right, right, just you have a brain. You look like a tiger head, heh.”

Li Huai made a face, playfully declaring, “Not listening, not listening, the turtle reciting scriptures.”

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly.

One day, Chen Ping'an sat in the corridor of Cui Dongshan's courtyard, holding the Sword Nourishing Gourd without drinking, gently shaking the wine jar with his palm resting on its top.

The small courtyard was temporarily empty, offering a rare moment of tranquility.

After refining two life essences, crafting the third item belonging to the five elements had become an unavoidable hurdle.

However, according to Zhang Shanfeng, an ordinary Qi Refining cultivator only needed three life essences—one for offense, one for defense, and the last to help absorb spiritual energy more rapidly. Even that is a significant achievement for a practitioner below the Earth Immortal level.

Regarding whether the two flying swords, the First and the Fifteenth, could be refined into Chen Ping'an's own life essences, Cui Dongshan spoke vaguely. He only mentioned that the fire sword of the Nascent Soul cultivator, gifted to Xie Xie, could be successfully refined into a life essence. However, when compared to a sword cultivator's life sword, the difference was substantial, akin to comparing clouds to mud. Although it would be considered low-quality compared to a fifth realm cultivator, for an ordinary Earth Immortal, being able to seize and refine a sword cultivator's life sword for oneself is still a cause for celebration.

Fire, earth, wood.

Three life essence items remained.

Chen Ping'an had long dismissed the idea of using the five-colored soil from the Great Li Dynasty for his life essence.

The old master of the Observation Dao had once sent a little disciple, who carried a large gourd, to relay that Ruan Xiu's fire dragon could be used for refining. However, Chen Ping'an had not lost his sanity; just thinking about Ruan Qiong's suspicious gaze was enough to make him helpless. If Ruan Qiong found out about such a reckless thought, he would surely hammer Chen Ping'an into a pile of mush with a sword-making hammer.

So, he decided not to think about the fire of the five elements.

Thus, the only remaining element was wood.

Chen Ping'an actually had a plan in mind—the old locust tree that had been cut down—but it had already been divided among the villagers. The locust wood sword that remained at the Sword Qi Great Wall was one of the branches he had sent Little Baoping to retrieve.

Song Jixin had mentioned the changes in his hometown; it was evident that the townsfolk had become increasingly shrewd. The keen-eyed keeper of the Bagu Zhai wouldn’t likely leave Chen Ping'an with a chance to pick up scraps.

Chen Ping'an scratched his head in distress.

He leaned back.

Now, he was a pure martial artist at the peak of the fifth realm.

For a second realm Qi Refining cultivator, the beginning is always the hardest. Chen Ping'an understood this better than anyone.

Having a semi-divine weapon sword immortal by his side, it was not easy to draw the sword unless he was prepared to fight to the death.

The Sword Nourishing Gourd held two flying swords; the Fifteenth was fine, but the First was close to rebellion, becoming increasingly in sync with Chen Ping'an's intent, almost daily clamoring for the last and largest piece of the Dragon-slaying Platform.

Wearing a golden robe before the seventh realm was harmless; in fact, it helped him absorb spiritual energy quickly. This largely compensated for the fatal flaw in his cultivation talent after severing ties with the Bridge of Eternal Life. However, every time he used introspection to patrol his energy points, the green-clad little spirits formed from water seemed to possess resentful gazes, clearly feeling the lack of spiritual energy in the water realm, placing them in an awkward position where they could do little with their skills. Hence, they felt particularly wronged.

Conversely, the golden literary talisman that manifested as a Confucian-clad figure brought Chen Ping'an unexpected joy. Riding the fire dragon, it paraded around, helping Chen Ping'an patrol his little realm. This action benefited his soul, aiding Chen Ping'an in expanding his meridians and purging the residual impurities left by his numerous fierce battles. The murky, tainted energies hidden deep within his soul seemed to be cleared away by the little figure riding the fire dragon, like a general attacking and taking down hidden enemies lurking in the mountains and forests.

However, the little talisman and the fire dragon were clearly not compatible with the diligent green-clad spirits of the water realm, and both sides had adopted a stance of not wanting to associate with one another.

Having barely become a Qi Refining cultivator, Chen Ping'an felt somewhat lost for the first time.

He had to make choices.

For the sake of survival, he was unhesitating in practicing punches and stances, enduring hardships.

But now, as life was no longer in danger, he could easily step into the sixth realm today if he wished, like a wealthy family pondering whether to earn gold or silver. This left Chen Ping'an feeling quite unaccustomed.

Deep down, having grown accustomed to being poor, he felt that the bag of coins he tightly clutched or the thin layer of rice in the granary was truly his.

Even with mountains of gold and silver beside him, he still felt that today they could belong to him, but upon waking tomorrow, they might belong to someone else.

Chen Ping'an knew this mindset was flawed, yet changing one’s nature is difficult. In this matter, he couldn’t say he was making no progress at all, but ultimately, the advancement was slow.

Over the years, Chen Ping'an had come to understand that many things had changed significantly. For instance, he had found it uncomfortable to wear boots instead of straw sandals and nearly stumbled. Or wearing the golden robe and inserting a jade hairpin, he felt like one of those monkeys dressed in fine clothing described in books. And for the dream he once shared with Lu Tai, he would buy many useless items that cost a fortune, hoping that one day he could have a grand and prosperous new home in Longquan County.

Chen Ping'an propped his legs up, gently swaying.

The lotus flower figure, sneaky as always, peeked from below, darting up the steps, finally settling on the back of Chen Ping'an's foot.

Chen Ping'an raised a finger to his lips, signaling it to keep quiet.

Ever since Cui Dongshan first appeared in the village in the Qianlian Kingdom, the lotus flower figure had almost never shown itself again; this was a request from Chen Ping'an. Although the little figure didn’t quite understand, it complied nonetheless.

Only one of its arms covered its mouth, nodding vigorously with a smile.

Chen Ping'an swayed his legs, the little creature seemed to be on a swing; had it not been for its hand covering its mouth, it would have giggled uncontrollably.

Seeing the joyful little figure made Chen Ping'an’s heart feel much more at peace, and all his distractions and worries evaporated.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, and before long, he felt a lightness on his foot. He turned to see the little figure imitating him, lying back with its legs crossed.

Upon noticing Chen Ping'an's gaze, it smiled with squinted eyes.

Chen Ping'an shifted onto his side, and the little figure followed suit.

Chen Ping'an began to shake his head, appearing to recite something, yet no sound came out.

The little figure mimicked Chen Ping'an, following suit.

The two of them, one large and one small, were unaware of what they were muttering.

Chen Ping'an did not know either.

Outside the courtyard wall, Cui Dongshan leaned against the wall, his body resembling... a slope.

Cui Dongshan understood why Chen Ping'an deliberately kept the lotus flower figure hidden from him.

Because in Chen Ping'an’s eyes, the carefree little figure was already the best it could be.

He didn’t even want to know whether the little figure was truly rare, priceless, or had great utility.

Thus, Cui Dongshan felt a bit uncomfortable.

He desperately wanted to tell Chen Ping'an that this little figure was truly remarkable.

Yet, for reasons unknown, after much contemplation, Cui Dongshan felt that whether or not he told Chen Ping'an would lead to the same result. So he thought, why not just leave it unsaid? It might actually be quite good.

Once he thought this through, Cui Dongshan’s face broke into a wide smile, returning to his usual demeanor. He lightly bumped his head back against the wall, straightened his body, and silently drifted away.

If life were not joyous, it was only because one had yet to recognize my master.

Cui Dongshan felt quite joyful at that moment, as he could use this statement to boast to Little Baoping, perhaps earning him a reprieve from being stamped with a seal in the future.

Thus, Cui Dongshan hurried away and reached the window ledge of the academy, winking at the girl in the red skirt.

He was promptly met with a sharp reprimand from the teacher. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 418: The Joys and Sorrows of Autumn

Unbeknownst to him, summer had quietly slipped into autumn.

Through this period of nurturing and diligent practice, Chen Ping'an had filled the energy reservoirs of his two life-bound objects with abundant spiritual energy.

Regarding the practice of boxing and Qi refinement, Chen Ping'an tried not to lean too heavily in one direction. However, as he truly became a Qi practitioner, he had recently been spending at least four hours each day on breathing exercises. The clarity of the impending bottleneck in his future grew ever more apparent. One day, to become a pure martial artist of the seventh realm and then ascend to the fifth realm among Qi practitioners, he would need to make another choice.

One day, Mao Xiaodong joked, “When you were training in Cui Dongshan's courtyard, I didn’t see you caring about the spiritual energy of the academy. Why was it that at the summit of Donghua Mountain, you wouldn’t take even a hint of spiritual energy? Are you being a bit too pretentious?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Once the grand rules are established, we can talk about adapting to local customs and human feelings. Cui Dongshan, thank you. Lin Shouyi, in this courtyard, we can draw on spiritual energy according to our realms, and the academy tacitly acknowledges this as correct. So naturally, I can as well. It’s somewhat like... outside this small courtyard, Donghua Mountain is part of the world of Haoran, but within this courtyard, it becomes a small realm of its own. As long as I’m not doing anything that contravenes my original intent or Confucian propriety, I am... free.”

Chen Ping'an spoke hesitantly, often pausing to contemplate before continuing.

Mao Xiaodong nodded.

It seemed that the effort he had put into his words back at Donghua Mountain had not been in vain.

Mao Xiaodong then asked, “‘A tree that stands out in the forest is bound to be blown down by the wind; those who soar above the masses will inevitably be criticized.’ What do you think the reasoning behind this is?”

Chen Ping'an answered, “The original intention should be to warn gentlemen to learn to hide their talents and adapt to a world that isn’t so good. As for what’s wrong with it, I can’t say; I just feel that the reality is far from what Confucians envision. Why this is so is even harder for me to fathom. Moreover, I think there’s a problem with this saying. It can easily lead people astray; fearing to stand out, many become afraid to surpass others, which leads to many thinking that suppressing talent and not standing out are common practices. Since everyone does it, if I follow suit, it's just conforming to the masses, after all, the law won’t punish the crowd. But once you delve deeper, it seems to entangle with what I said about adapting to local customs. Although it can indeed be categorized, varying by time, place, and person, and then clarify the boundaries, I still feel it’s quite cumbersome; I must not have found the fundamental method yet.”

This time, Chen Ping'an still spoke in fits and starts. So, unable to contain his curiosity, he asked, “These so-called golden words of wisdom that people hold in high regard—while I don’t deny they can help avoid many hardships, can they truly be recognized as ‘rules’ by Confucian sages?”

Mao Xiaodong burst into laughter but didn’t provide an answer.

Mao Xiaodong then changed the topic, “What do you think of the phrase, ‘A white horse is not a horse’?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Cui Dongshan once mentioned this, saying it’s because when the sages first created characters, they weren’t perfect, and thus the Dao was inevitably incomplete, leading to the ‘textual barrier’ that confounds people. As time passed, later generations have created more characters, and what was once a difficult problem is now easily solved. A white horse is indeed a type of horse, but a white horse is not equivalent to a horse. It’s a pity for the ancients who could only circle around that ‘non’ character. According to Cui Dongshan, this is also called a ‘contextual barrier.’ If one doesn’t understand this learning, no matter how many characters are added, it’s still futile. For example, if someone states a correct fact, and another denies it using another correct fact, people might instinctively think the former is wrong if they don’t delve deeper or break it down. This is committing a contextual barrier, along with many examples of overgeneralization and confusion of order, all stemming from a lack of understanding of the background. Cui Dongshan is quite indignant about this, saying that scholars, even virtuous gentlemen and sages, cannot escape this calamity. He also stated that every person in the world should be taught this learning when young, as it’s the foundation of standing tall, more useful than any lofty principle. Cui Dongshan further argues that at least half of the writings of various schools of thought are ‘unclear.’ Only by understanding this learning does one qualify to grasp the fundamental teachings of the Sage and the Rites. Otherwise, ordinary scholars might seem to study the sacred texts diligently but ultimately only build a castle in the air, floating amidst the clouds of the White Emperor City, completely disconnected.”

After pondering this, Mao Xiaodong laughed, “Not all of that little brat’s words are just venting; there’s some substance to them.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Cui Dongshan is willing to speak, and I’m just here to listen. After all, the Sage of Literature once advised me that thinking things through is always good, even if the conclusion ends up being a denial. That seemingly unnecessary detour is not in vain.”

Mao Xiaodong clapped and laughed, “Teacher is brilliant!”

Then with an expectant look, Mao Xiaodong hoped this little junior brother had some insight.

Chen Ping'an held back a laugh, understanding, and said, “If I get to meet the Sage of Literature next time, I’ll make sure to talk more about Maoshan.”

Mao Xiaodong whispered, “Make sure not to be too reserved. My teacher doesn’t appreciate that. For instance, when I said ‘Teacher is brilliant,’ you should just relay that back unembellished, even if you add some flair, but you absolutely mustn’t be indirect.”

Chen Ping'an said he’d remember that.

Finally, Mao Xiaodong handed Chen Ping'an a letter sent via flying sword from Piyun Mountain in Longquan County, Dali.

Mao Xiaodong departed.

The current administrators of the Mountain Cliff Academy had some individuals whose hearts were uneasy, and they needed him to soothe them.

Engaging in casual conversations with Chen Ping'an from time to time not only helped him assert his seniority but also provided a break from his busy schedule. Of course, it was also his duty as a senior brother to ensure Chen Ping'an's state of mind was steady.

After opening the letter, he recognized the familiar handwriting of Wei Ban, the God of the North Mountain.

Previously, Chen Ping'an had sent a letter to Wei Ban inquiring about the western mountains being sold off at a low price.

Chen Ping'an held a natural trust in Wei Ban, the earliest and only remaining divine mountain deity of the Divine Water Kingdom.

In the letter, Wei Ban informed Chen Ping'an that previously, including the Xu family of Qingfeng City, a total of nine mountain peaks were looking for new owners, with several families like Ruan Qiong and the Li family from Fulujie each taking over one. For now, only two remained. If Chen Ping'an was interested, he could help negotiate the price. Moreover, Wei Ban suggested that although the remaining two were the ones others had overlooked, buying them wouldn’t be a loss. He even complained about why Chen Ping'an didn’t send the letter earlier; otherwise, he could have taken over Niujiao Mountain himself. Even if Chen Ping'an didn’t have enough divine money, Wei Ban could front it, and they would split the ownership of Niujiao Mountain, which had a treasure like Baofu Zhai—a half-sell, half-gift immortal crossing point!

Chen Ping'an read the letter again, ensuring he hadn’t missed any hidden implications, before storing it carefully.

The western mountains of Longquan County, rich in spiritual energy, were no less than the top immortal residences of Baopingzhou. However, the land’s spiritual flow was heavily divided, and the territory was too small. For those sects with territories often spanning hundreds or even thousands of miles, those individual Longquan peaks, most of which only spanned several dozen miles, were indeed hard to form a significant influence. Of course, supporting a Golden Core Earth Immortal was more than sufficient.

Chen Ping'an felt that purchasing a mountain was feasible.

He went to Mao Xiaodong's study and picked up a pen to write a letter, asking Wei Ban to negotiate a price first.

He had Pei Qian run the errand to hand it over to an old scholar responsible for such matters at the academy.

Sitting in the antique study, Chen Ping'an recalled a recent casual chat where Cui Dongshan casually mentioned the debate between Buddhism and Daoism in the Kingdom of Qingluan. Previously, he had mentioned to Chen Ping'an that there weren’t many “serious” books from the various schools of thought, so he casually suggested that Chen Ping'an could find those few Buddhist and Daoist classics in the academy’s library.

After hesitating, Chen Ping'an left the study, waiting for Lin Shouyi to finish his Qi refinement, and then dragged him to the library.

On the way, Lin Shouyi smiled and asked, “Have you figured out that matter yet?”

Chen Ping'an paused, then suddenly remembered the gratitude expressed by Lin Shouyi during his first visit to the academy.

Chen Ping'an chuckled wryly, “I really can’t guess. I’m quite curious, so don’t keep me guessing. If you don’t say, I’ll definitely ask you directly before I leave the academy.”

Lin Shouyi smiled and said, “Do you remember that time on the muddy mountain path when Li Huai was rolling around in the dirt, and everyone was annoyed?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, “I vaguely remember. Later, I promised to make a book box for Li Huai, and he stopped causing trouble. Otherwise, we’d probably have been stuck there for a while. But in these past few years, Li Huai has matured a lot.”

Lin Shouyi asked, “Do you remember what you said to me back then?”

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment.

Lin Shouyi smiled and said, “I know you definitely remember.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Such a small matter, you actually paid that much attention?”

Lin Shouyi nodded, “At that time, I was the least sociable. Li Baoping called you ‘little uncle,’ and Li Huai was closest to you. Even A Liang liked to chat and joke with them, while Zhu Lu and Zhu He were a father-daughter pair. Only I, Lin Shouyi, seemed the most out of place. Although I acted unconcerned, how could I not feel a bit despondent inside? So for a long time, I doubted whether it was right for me to study alongside you all in the Great Sui.”

As Lin Shouyi spoke about this, the always serious Daoist beauty at the academy showed some warmth in her smile. “Then you squatted in the mud and turned to me, saying two sentences: ‘Should I make you one too?’ ‘It’s just as easy as that.’”

Lin Shouyi walked slowly, “So I agreed at that time.”

Chen Ping'an burst out laughing, “I didn’t think much of it back then; I just felt that if I didn’t say it, you definitely wouldn’t ask for one. When I eventually made a book box for Li Huai, you were the only one left out, and I worried you might distance yourself from Li Baoping and Li Huai because of it. To be honest, at that time, I did consider your feelings a bit, but more so, I was thinking that among the three of us, you, Lin Shouyi, are the oldest and most stable in temperament. Once I leave the academy, I hoped you would take care of them a bit more.”

Lin Shouyi nodded, “I actually understood all this back then, but there’s one thing I did fairly well: I won’t feel unfair if others show me kindness, just because they show more kindness to others.”

Lin Shouyi smiled more, “Later, on the ferry across the river, you were the first to make a small book box for Li Huai, while mine ended up being the last one you made. Naturally, that bamboo box you crafted the best at became the one you were most familiar with. At that moment, I realized that Chen Ping'an, you’re not much of a talker, but you’re actually quite nice. So when I arrived at the academy and saw Li Huai being bullied, although I didn’t contribute much, I didn’t hide away. Do you know? At that time, I clearly saw my own path of cultivation, so I was betting my entire future on it, ready for the worst outcome—at worst, I’d end up crippled and become a private child looked down upon by my parents. But I still wanted to be someone you, Chen Ping'an, wouldn’t look down upon.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’ve kept this in my heart.”

Lin Shouyi smiled, “So after that assassination attempt in the courtyard with the Yuan Ying sword, when you, Chen Ping'an, entered the courtyard and deliberately sat next to me, I knew that you, Chen Ping'an, also knew that aside from that clueless Li Huai, even Pei Qian, all the others in the courtyard were aware of why you chose to sit beside me. It was to prevent me from being disheartened, watching you all enjoy the battle while I could only stand by and watch, fearing that Lin Shouyi and you all would drift apart.”

Chen Ping'an stopped walking, not denying it, and asked with a smile, “So do you know what I’m most grateful to you for? Now it's your turn to guess.”

Lin Shouyi shook his head repeatedly, “I’m a very stubborn person, and I don’t think much about other things, unlike you, Chen Ping'an. I definitely can’t guess.”

Chen Ping'an didn’t keep him in suspense, saying, “You once told me that not all parents in the world are like mine, Chen Ping'an.”

Lin Shouyi looked somewhat puzzled.

Chen Ping'an extended a fist and raised a finger, smiling, “First of all, I’m very glad that you, Lin Shouyi, are willing to say such things, which means you consider me a friend. After all, your identity has always been your biggest emotional burden.”

He raised a second finger, “I’ve held onto this statement tightly, to the extent that after my journey in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, I could continue to walk this path with Pei Qian, all thanks to your words.”

He finally raised a third finger, “And after hearing this, I felt like... a penniless person suddenly discovering he had inherited a vast fortune! Just thinking about this made me feel no shame around wealthier peers, like Fan Er, who later became a friend, or Liu Youzhou from Aiyai Prefecture, with whom I never became friends. I didn’t feel any embarrassment about wealth at all.”

Lin Shouyi smiled and then hit the nail on the head, “I estimate that Song Jixin resents you for this.”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Stopping in front of the library, Chen Ping'an looked up at the tall building, “Lin Shouyi, I’m so glad that my insignificant kindness is treasured and valued by you.”

Lin Shouyi remarked, “In this world, even good people tend to demand a lot from good people, so you should cherish a friend like me.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “I will!”

Lin Shouyi asked, “So if you give me something, does that mean I don’t have to worry about returning the favor in the future?”

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, pulling Lin Shouyi closer, “Not a chance!”

Lin Shouyi deftly broke free from Chen Ping'an’s grasp, straightening his clothes and complaining, “If the girls at the academy saw this scene, I might lose a few admirers. I naturally don’t like them, but I don’t mind them liking me.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “From what I’ve seen over these years at the academy, you, Lin Shouyi, have actually changed the most in secret.”

Lin Shouyi and Chen Ping'an exchanged glances, both thinking of someone, then inexplicably burst into hearty laughter.

This was perhaps the connection friends shared.

Two fellow townsmen, laughing and chatting, stepped into the library together.

Countless teachings awaited them to explore and extract.

---

Meanwhile, at the Bamboo Loft on Lupo Mountain, a young boy dressed in green had just finished a farewell drink with friends at a tavern in a nearby town.

A girl in a pink skirt sat on a small bamboo chair, munching on sunflower seeds, noticing that he seemed a bit disinterested. She asked, “Didn’t you drink enough with your brother, the River God? Or was the drink too expensive?”

The young boy plopped down next to her on the bamboo chair, resting his chin on his hands, “You wouldn’t understand the ways of the rivers and lakes.”

The girl in the pink skirt reached out and poured some sunflower seeds for him, which he accepted without refusal.

The River God from Huangting Kingdom had successfully obtained an incredibly valuable peace talisman through the young boy.

He then received permission from the Ministry of Rites of Huangting Kingdom to leave the jurisdiction, cross the border into Dali, and visit Lupo Mountain.

The young boy, along with his closest brother from the rivers and lakes, had explored many places, and the girl in the pink skirt suspected he had bragged a lot in front of the River God.

After finishing the sunflower seeds, the young boy fell into a fit of gloomy lamentation, restlessly scratching his head, and then suddenly calmed down, sitting straight with a lack of spirit, leaning back against the bamboo chair, and slowly said, “The River Gods are ranked in tiers. While drinking, my brother mentioned that he saw the highest-ranked river god from Tieshu River on the way here and was quite envious. He wanted me to speak well of him to the Dali court, so some tributaries could be incorporated into his jurisdiction.”

“Did he offer you any divine money for connections?”

“None.”

The girl in the pink skirt looked at him strangely.

The young boy shot her an annoyed glance, “It’s not that my brother is stingy; he himself said that discussing money among brothers is too unreasonable. I think that makes sense. Right now, I’m just worried about which temple I should go to burn incense for which deity. You know, Wei Ban has always looked down on me; the last time I sought him out, he kept dodging me, not showing any brotherly affection or friendship. The mountain god at our mountain peak, who has a golden head, doesn’t have any useful words. I encountered a wall with the county magistrate, Wu Yuan, and the county magistrate surnamed Yuan too. I did have some luck with that swordsman named Xu Ruo, who gave us each a peace talisman. I think there’s a chance, but I just can’t find him.”

The girl in the pink skirt munched on sunflower seeds and asked softly, “Even if you find the temple, do you have the offering money?”

The young boy hesitated, “That Xu Ruo might not charge me. Since Xu Ruo has such a good relationship with our master, would he dare to ask for my money? If it really doesn’t work, I’ll owe him first and then borrow money from the master to pay Xu Ruo back. That should work, right?”

The girl in the pink skirt grew angry, “What’s wrong with you?! Why are you always thinking about the master’s money?”

The young boy muttered, “A single coin can thwart a hero. What’s so strange about that? Who doesn’t have a time of hardship? Besides, isn’t our place called Lupo Mountain? It’s the master’s fault for choosing such an unlucky mountain.”

The girl in the pink skirt grew more furious, “You can blame the master for this? Has your conscience been eaten by a dog?!”

Had it been over something else, the young boy would have exploded with anger at her words, but today, he didn’t even feel like getting angry; he couldn’t muster the energy.

At this moment, Wei Ban, who had rarely visited Lupo Mountain in the past year, appeared on the path, walking over slowly.

The young boy leaped up, rushing over, and with an exaggerated smile said, “Wei the Great God, what brings you here today? Are you tired from walking? Would you like to sit on a bamboo chair? I can give you a shoulder rub or massage your legs!”

Wei Ban reached out and pressed down on the boy’s head, “Go and cool off.”

The young boy wrapped his arms around one of Wei Ban's sleeves, resulting in Wei Ban dragging him toward the pond behind the bamboo loft.

The girl in the pink skirt shook her head, utterly embarrassed for her master.

Wei Ban squatted by the clear pond, where the golden lotus seed had already begun to sprout.

The young boy squatted beside him, “Wei Old God, can I discuss something with you?”

Wei Ban stared intently at the precious seed. After all, it was one of the “relics” left by the Daoist Patriarch Lu Chen in this world. This was also the reason why the divine lineage of the Divine Water Kingdom, despite its long severance, still maintained a connection and its fate was not yet extinguished. It was also why Wei Ban set his sights on the Tieshu River’s river god, Yang Hua. As the last remnant of the Divine Water Kingdom, Wei Ban managed to escape during that catastrophe and survive until he became the God of the North Mountain of the Dali dynasty. There was a natural destiny at play, but Wei Ban's own endurance was equally crucial; if one does not help themselves, Heaven will not help.

Wei Ban's tone was indifferent, directly dispelling the young boy’s glimmer of hope, “That River God thinks you’re a fool, and you’re just happily playing the fool?”

The young boy, incensed, took a few steps back, then turned around to face Wei Ban's back, kicking at it in frustration, before quickly running away.

Before leaving Lupo Mountain, Wei Ban smiled at the two little ones sitting on the bamboo chair, “Your master will be back soon.”

Wei Ban strode away.

The girl in the pink skirt was overjoyed, but for some reason, when she turned around, she found the young boy, who should have been just as surprised and happy, sitting dazedly on the bamboo chair, looking lost.

She softly asked, “What’s wrong?”

The young boy murmured, “You’ve been foolish enough, and I ended up calling Wei Ban a fool. Do you think our master will be disappointed when he sees us this time?”

The girl in the pink skirt stood up in a huff, no longer paying attention to the good-hearted fool, and went to fetch a bucket of water and a cloth, starting to wipe down the bamboo loft meticulously.

The young boy bent over, resting his chin in his hands. He had once envisioned a scene where his brother, the River God, visited Lupo Mountain, and he could sit beside them with confidence, watching Chen Ping'an and his brother meet and enjoy each other's company, raising glasses and toasting. He would feel very proud. After the feast, he could boast about his past exploits in the rivers and lakes with Chen Ping'an on the way back to Lupo Mountain, recounting how splendidly he had fared.

But he now realized that it seemed a bit difficult.

The young boy felt somewhat down, looking down at the sunflower seed shells on the ground, noticing a few that had been missed, and out of boredom, he began picking them up and eating them, finding that they tasted even better than usual?

Just then, the girl in the pink skirt, who was cleaning the steps of the bamboo loft, happened to catch sight of this scene and exclaimed in surprise, “Are you really so poor now? Did you give away all your savings to your brother, the River God?”

Having improved in mood, the young boy rolled his eyes at her, “I’m not foolish; I have to leave something for my wife, right? I don’t want to end up like Old Cui, a lifelong bachelor! When young, I didn’t know how precious money was, and now I’m growing old as a pitiful bachelor. Once our master returns, I’m going to have a good talk about this, to prevent him from enjoying being that good-natured boy…”

Suddenly, a loud crash resounded.

The young boy flew off the cliff.

The girl in the pink skirt had grown accustomed to this and didn’t worry about his safety.

A long green serpent abruptly appeared, riding the clouds and mist, swiftly climbing the cliff, resuming the form of the young boy, swaggering toward the bamboo loft. “Honest words can be bitter to the ears; no wonder since ancient times, loyal ministers and good generals often meet ill ends…”

Another loud crash echoed.

The young boy was sent flying off the cliff once more.

Upon returning to the mountaintop a second time, he saw an old man in a Confucian robe standing barefoot on the second floor of the bamboo loft. The young boy immediately shouted, “Old Cui, I didn’t say anything this time!”

He was then knocked off the mountain cliff again.

The girl in the pink skirt was on the second floor, wiping the railings, somewhat puzzled.

The old man with the surname Cui smiled and said, “Your skin is itchy and you need a beating to learn your lesson.”

The girl in the pink skirt had no rebuttal and no longer pleaded for the young boy.

On the path of Lupo Mountain, the young boy cursed and ran back up the mountain.

---

On an overseas island near the Central Plains Divine Continent.

The Confucian-robed man had just turned away a visitor, denying an audience to a grand scholar from a lineage of semi-saints.

Previously, even if he was unwilling to “open the door,” he would still at least show his face. This time, he didn’t even bother to appear.

The grand scholar left in disappointment, feeling a bit anxious deep down.

He couldn’t fathom why this scholar was behaving so coldly.

The Confucian-robed man stood in the hut where Zhao Yao had once resided, surrounded by mountains of books.

He stood in one spot, flipping through a casually pulled Confucian book, authored by a Confucian sage whose lineage had been severed. Having died young in the passage of time without warning, his disciples had failed to grasp the quintessence of the teachings, and within a century, the scholarly line had come to a complete end.

He set the book down and stepped out of the hut, climbing to the mountaintop to gaze across the vast sea.

Zhao Yao had come here under the protection of a lingering spirit.

Otherwise, even a great heavenly master from Longhu Mountain and a grand scholar from a learning academy would have to knock on the door to enter; how could Zhao Yao have arrived here so fortuitously?

He retracted his gaze, looking toward the cliffside where Zhao Yao had attempted to step out.

He certainly didn’t care.

It was just that at that time, a middle-aged Confucian with graying hair had been signaling him.

That was when he had spoken to dissuade Zhao Yao.

After Zhao Yao left the island, he had a conversation with the Confucian who had brought Zhao Yao here.

He asked, “If you care so much, why not appear before him?”

The other replied, “Zhao Yao is still young; seeing me would only increase his guilt. Some emotional knots need to be untied by him alone, and he will come to understand them in due time after walking a longer path.”

He asked, “Aren’t you, Qi Jingchun, afraid Zhao Yao will never know your thoughts until he dies? Zhao Yao has great potential; establishing a sect in the Central Plains Divine Continent would not be difficult. You have stripped your life’s work of its lineage and stored it within the paper of Wulong Town, waiting for Zhao Yao to encounter a time of renewal. But aren’t you afraid Zhao Yao will become a pawn for other lineages or even Daoism?”

Qi Jingchun replied, “It doesn’t matter; I only hope my student can live well. Whether he inherits my lineage or not, compared to Zhao Yao being able to study and seek knowledge peacefully for a lifetime, it’s not that important.”

He sighed, “Qi Jingchun, what a pity.”

At that time, Qi Jingchun only smiled and remained silent.

At this moment, the once-great Confucian from the Central Plains, who had once split the Yellow River’s cave sky with a sword, felt that he had lost another confidant in life.

On Baopingzhou’s Yunxia Mountain.

Cai Jinjian, who had occupied a peak residence alone, sat cross-legged on a mat today, and upon opening her eyes, she got up and walked to a scenic viewpoint with a broad view.

As she advanced along her path of cultivation, her demeanor grew increasingly cold, but she seemed to recall some matters, a smile surfacing.

Years ago, a scholar she admired deeply had done something that shook her to the core when he handed her the first painting of the river of time.

That esteemed Mr. Qi, in her eyes a paragon of wisdom, had, like a student seeking guidance from a teacher, earnestly asked her, “If you were to send this painting to the Sword Qi Great Wall, would it be overkill? Would it ruin its beauty instead?”

Cai Jinjian still vividly remembered the bewilderment she felt at that moment; it was almost akin to a Nascent Soul cultivator facing tribulation, struck by thunder.

When Mr. Qi saw her expressing such a dazed look, he smiled and said, “When it comes to matters between men and women, I have six insights and one blind spot.”

Cai Jinjian maintained a stern face, trying her best to hold it together.

Mr. Qi, with a hint of helplessness, said, “If you want to laugh, then laugh.”

In the end, Cai Jinjian didn’t laugh, feeling rather sad deep inside. She stared at Mr. Qi, and when she regained her composure, she gave her answer, “If one doesn’t like it, doing these things may not be useful. Whether it’s overkill or not doesn’t matter. If one already has some affection, seeing these things might only increase that affection.”

At that time, after hearing Cai Jinjian’s words, Mr. Qi seemed to lighten the burden on his shoulders, smiling brightly.

Mr. Qi’s smile back then made Cai Jinjian realize that despite his high knowledge, he was still very much human.

Cai Jinjian leaned on the railing, squinting her eyes with a smile. Although she was gazing far into the distance, the spectacular scenery outside the viewpoint was not in her sight.

Secretly loving such a man, even knowing he wouldn’t reciprocate her feelings, Cai Jinjian felt it was the most beautiful thing.

On her path of cultivation, no matter how many years or centuries passed, Cai Jinjian wished to think of him during those quiet and lonely moments when no one else was around.

---

In the middle of Baopingzhou, at an immortal crossing point bordering the southern frontier of the Zhuying Dynasty.

Liu Qingshan bought a large jug of wine and sat by the river, taking big gulps.

Liu Boqi knew this day would come, but he hadn’t expected it to arrive even faster than anticipated.

First, there had been a minor conflict with a Qi practitioner, which was a small matter, but then came a more significant piece of bad news regarding the farce in the Kingdom of Qingluan.

She snatched the wine jug from Liu Qingshan’s hands and said solemnly, “I’ve hardly read any books, so I can’t express great principles. You’re the scholar, so you might not listen to me, but regardless, I want you to know one thing!”

Liu Boqi, the head of the Sword Room, held the wine jug in one hand and pressed down on the fierce-looking dagger at her waist with the other, her expression sharp and fierce, “There are many foolish and wicked people in this world, and how many books they’ve read has nothing to do with it. When they encounter even a little goodness, they either want to possess it or destroy it. In the future, if you’re willing to reason with these people, you can go ahead, but if it doesn’t work out in the end, I’ll step in.”

Liu Qingshan just shook his head vigorously, “I’ve already figured all this out; I just want to know why my elder brother did that. As a son, I want to talk to my most respected elder brother. What should I do? I know I’m lacking in many ways compared to my brother; I just want to go home and talk to him. Is that okay?”

Liu Boqi shook her head for the first time in her life, not indulging Liu Qingfeng, “Don’t talk about this. You should just endure it.”

Liu Qingshan murmured, “Why not?”

Liu Boqi said, “About this matter, I don’t know the origins or the reasons, and I’m not willing to say anything reckless to comfort you. But I do know your brother is suffering even more than you right now. If you think you’ll feel better by pouring salt on his wounds, then go ahead, I won’t stop you, but I’ll think less of you. So Liu Qingshan is such a coward after all. Your mind is smaller than a woman’s!”

Liu Qingshan stared blankly.

Liu Boqi felt a little uneasy and directly asked, “Did I say something too harsh?”

Liu Qingshan stared at her for a long time, then suddenly smiled, wiping his tears and snot, “It’s okay.”

Only then did Liu Boqi return the wine jug to Liu Qingshan, saying, “Now you can drink.”

Liu Qingshan didn’t hold back, taking the jug and gulping down the wine.

He drank until he leaned over by the riverbank and vomited.

Liu Boqi gently patted his back, “If you still want to drink, I’ll go buy some more for you.”

Liu Qingshan gently shook his head.

Finally, Liu Boqi was seen carrying Liu Qingshan on her back, walking through the bustling streets.

On the road outside a county town in the Kingdom of Qingluan, after heavy rain, the ground was muddy, and puddles formed.

A carriage driven by an older man from the county slowed down. After a moment, it sped up again toward the county town.

Inside the carriage, Wang Yifu, who was sitting with Liu Qingfeng, cast a glance at the latter, who was resting with his eyes closed.

Wang Yifu was one of the two individuals secretly sent by the national teacher Cui Zhan into the Kingdom of Qingluan. Now he was nominally a county lieutenant but actually served as a martial secretary for Liu Qingfeng, preventing assassination attempts.

This showed how highly Cui Zhan regarded this little county magistrate from a small kingdom.

Wang Yifu knew that behind their carriage, several women and children were trudging along.

He closed his eyes as well.

This former general of the fallen Lu dynasty began to look forward to what high position this civil servant from the Kingdom of Qingluan might attain in the Dali court in the future.

---

On the northern border of the Zhuying Dynasty.

Chaos reigned.

On a mountain path, several immortal practitioners from small sects concealed their identities, disguising themselves as wild cultivators, and had been observing a convoy of officials fleeing to the south.

They were coincidentally encountered by Ma Kuxuan, one of whom was dragging a beautifully dressed lady by her hair, attempting to taste the county magistrate's wife’s flavor.

At first, Ma Kuxuan had no intention of intervening, continuing on his way, but upon being obstructed by a Qi practitioner, he ended up killing one and injuring another. The last one fled in panic, and Ma Kuxuan didn’t bother to pursue.

The half-dead Qi practitioner was pinned beneath Ma Kuxuan’s foot, who smiled and said, “Is this how a villain acts? If you want to be a bad guy, you should at least have some awareness. Do I really need to teach you this?”

With that, Ma Kuxuan stomped through the man’s chest.

Continuing on his way, he didn’t expect that the disheveled woman among the people would have a young boy, who, feeling humiliated, angrily questioned why Ma Kuxuan didn’t kill the last man. Wasn’t that leaving a tiger to harm others?

Ma Kuxuan promptly punched the boy dead, then passed through the now-silent convoy, leaving behind a single remark, “Fools who act foolishly deserve to die even more than villains.”

After departing, a soldier from Zhenwu Mountain emerged, frowning, “That ignorant boy didn’t deserve to die.”

Ma Kuxuan smiled, “Everyone was supposed to die; shouldn’t they be thankful I did a good deed for once?”

The woman wailed over her son’s corpse, filled with hatred and fear for the cruel young man.

---

At the nearest immortal sect to the capital of Dali, Changchun Palace.

The defenses were tight.

Prince Song He stood with his mother at the mountaintop, smilingly asking, “Is the royal uncle trying to usurp the throne?”

Song He quickly shook his head, saying, “Is it really necessary to go to such trouble? Wouldn’t it be easier to orchestrate an assassination? The assassins of the Great Sui and the remnants of the Lu dynasty would all do, right? Mother, I estimate that at this moment, not only the border troops of Dali but even many on the court are encouraging the royal uncle to ascend the throne. Most of those supporting us are civil officials, which is useless.”

The former powerful woman of the Dali dynasty smiled, “He Er, don’t underestimate your royal uncle. He thinks highly of himself and doesn’t care for a dragon throne.”

Song He was skeptical.

Whether one cared for it or not was one thing; in a secular dynasty, who wouldn’t find a dragon throne uncomfortable?

The woman comforted him, “The hearts of the people are with us.”

Song He turned his head, “The hearts of the people? Mother, haven’t you always said they’re ignorant and foolish ants?”

The woman covered her mouth and chuckled, “This kind of talk is fine for us to share privately, but in other situations, remember, it’s one thing to know it, but don’t say it out loud. When you eventually become the supreme monarch of the world, you must learn to feign ignorance. This applies to your wise and mighty royal uncle as well as the entire court of civil and military officials.”

Song He asked, “What about the people on the mountain?”

The woman seemed hesitant.

Song He said, “I’ve always wondered why Father insisted on competing with those immortals. If I were a Qi practitioner, especially at a high level, who would willingly be bound by a mortal ruler? If I become emperor in the future, do you think more immortal factions would pledge allegiance to me, gathering around my throne? Perhaps I could then gradually balance the power of the national teacher and my royal uncle?”

The petite yet exquisitely graceful palace-clad woman sighed, “He Er, don’t speak such foolishness again; it’s best if you don’t even think about it.”

Song He replied, “Okay, I’ll listen to Mother.”

The woman smiled sweetly.

This was what made her son most endearing—obedient and docile—hence their hearts were often in sync.

As for the other matter, she deliberately refrained from thinking too much.

---

At the Longquan Sword Sect.

Ruan Xiu stood in her courtyard, enjoying the pastries purchased from Qilong Alley.

Inside the courtyard, the chicks had grown into hens, and the hens had produced another brood of chicks, with the mother hen and chicks multiplying.

The once simple-minded earth dog had begun to show signs of ruling the roost, running wild in the western mountains, but fortunately, having suffered before, it didn’t dare to act too recklessly. When it saw people in the market, it would obediently tuck its tail.

After finishing her pastries, Ruan Xiu put away her embroidered handkerchief and clapped her hands.

She leaped up.

She went to the cliff where someone had carved the words “Heaven Opens Divine Wonder” and walked down from the top of the cliff.

Upon reaching the bottom, she turned back and retraced her steps.

---

That day, Chen Ping'an took Li Baoping and Pei Qian to stroll around the capital of the Great Sui.

Cui Dongshan stood in his study, glancing at the casually piled immortal scrolls and then at the few books Chen Ping'an had borrowed from the library.

On the desk lay Chen Ping'an's carving knife and a few bamboo slips, all meant for jotting down the texts from those books, left unput away.

Cui Dongshan felt a bit pleased.

Li Baoping, Pei Qian, and Li Huai treated this place as their territory.

Wasn’t there a similar sign from Chen Ping'an?

However, today, Cui Dongshan felt a bit dissatisfied, for no apparent reason, leaving him feeling helpless.

He had done everything he could, both openly and covertly.

Yet, it still seemed quite difficult.

So he left the study and sat cross-legged in the green bamboo corridor, his palm resting on the floor, smiling slightly, “Little one, come out.”

With a sudden flick of his sleeve, a little figure was pulled out, dazed and swaying.

Upon realizing it was Cui Dongshan, the little figure wanted to escape back underground.

But no matter how much it jumped, it couldn’t manage to do so and tried to run out of the corridor to the courtyard.

It merely seemed to hit a wall and fell back into the corridor.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, “Silly little thing.”

The little figure sat on the ground, its head drooping.

Cui Dongshan looked at it and recalled his past.

Back then, as a student, he had accompanied a poor old scholar in a dilapidated alley that had yet to thrive. Although he couldn’t be considered a high-ranking person back then, he had already been a Qi practitioner. If it hadn’t been for the numerous cumbersome rules set by the old scholar from the start, how could they have lived so poorly? They could barely afford to eat! Then one day, he wanted to earn some money to return. As for whether the old scholar would drive him away according to their agreement, he couldn’t care less; a living person can’t be suffocated by urine! But when he returned with a large bag of silver, the old scholar had a blank expression and said two sentences: from now on, they were no longer master and disciple. The second was a hope that regardless of where the silver came from, it should be returned there because that silver was his disciple’s ill-gotten gains. But after that, whether Cui Zhan wanted to deceive or rob, the old scholar couldn’t even manage his top disciple anymore and couldn’t control him any longer; he didn’t have that capability.

Back then, the young Cui Zhan had been just like the little figure now, sulking and silent.

The mindset might be different, but the pitiful appearance was strikingly similar.

Cui Dongshan remembered that young Cui Zhan didn’t cry or make a fuss, begging the old scholar not to expel him, but he had said two things: “I can return the silver, but I hope to keep a couple of silver coins. After all, I still owe half a year’s tuition.” The second was that the young Cui Zhan told the old scholar to take that silver and buy better brushes, as the bare, worn-down brush handles were not worth throwing away. Even if one had some knowledge in their belly, how could they write an article?

On that day, the old scholar had left Cui Zhan waiting in a bare room.

The old scholar walked out, quietly sighed in the alley, and finally borrowed some money from a neighbor, cursing at a woman who had always looked down on him for being poor. He said a whole lot of nonsense. The old scholar didn’t retort but just smiled. He spent all the money to buy half a paper-wrapped roast chicken and swaggered back home, never mentioning the words about expelling Cui Zhan again. He just invited Cui Zhan to sit down and eat the roast chicken.

The two of them sat across from each other at that rickety table. After eating for a while, Cui Zhan asked the old scholar why he wasn’t eating.

The old scholar replied that he had a toothache and couldn’t eat greasy food.

The young Cui Zhan continued eating and asked the old scholar if he had borrowed money to buy the brushes.

The old scholar patted his belly and said, “It’s all here; it won’t run away. What’s the harm in writing a bit later? One can always write more articles at once.”

Young Cui Zhan actually knew that the poor old scholar, who spoke such grandiose words, was just hiding the fact that his stomach was growling.

The old scholar finally said softly, “Little Zhan, this half a roast chicken can only be bought with money, whether it’s for you or me. But the knowledge in my belly that doesn’t fit the times, you can take as much as you want, no need to spend any money. Of course, it might not be worth much. As long as we scholars don’t starve to death, we’ll continue to talk about principles.”

That day was actually the first time Cui Zhan left the lineage of the Sage of Literature, although it was just a brief moment of less than an hour.

But later, all the younger brothers and sisters around him and Qi Jingchun, all the disciples of the Sage of Literature, never knew about this.

Neither Cui Zhan nor the old scholar spoke of it.

---

Today, Cui Dongshan tapped the little figure’s head with his finger and smiled, “Let’s talk about something serious, related to my teacher. Do you want to hear it?”

The little one hesitated for a long time before nodding.

Cui Dongshan slowly said, “My teacher has a mountain called Lupo Mountain, where there’s a pond with a golden lotus seed. It could very well be your chance to achieve Dao, perhaps even the first spirit in Baopingzhou to break the bottleneck of Nascent Soul and ascend to the upper five realms. When that happens, Lupo Mountain will greatly benefit, as it can gather and consolidate a lot of spiritual energy and opportunities through you. In cultivation, certain barriers are often first come, first served. If you’re late, you might not even have a chance to squat over the latrine.”

The little figure blinked, then raised its arm, tightly clenching its fist, perhaps to encourage itself?

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “But I have one request of you. On a certain day in the future, when my teacher isn’t by your side and someone tells you these things, and you feel particularly useless, feeling like you should do something for my teacher…”

Cui Dongshan said solemnly, “Don’t do it!”

The little figure looked even more confused.

Cui Dongshan pointed to his heart, then to the little one, smiling, “You are my teacher’s paradise.”

The little one tilted its head, indicating it didn’t understand.

Cui Dongshan turned his gaze upward, “When he looks at you, he sees the most beautiful sight in his heart in this world—at least one of them. How can I put this? You’re like a flower blooming from all the hardships he suffered in his youth. Seeing you allows him to feel at ease. It reminds him that he is not alone in this world, that there are fools like him, just the same. And what luck that you met like this. There may even come a day when my teacher changes due to the complexities of the world, but if you remain unchanged, it will provide him with a bit of peace, allowing him to change a little slower, a little less.”

Cui Dongshan withdrew his gaze, “But if you do as I say, you will lose a monumental opportunity.”

The little figure shook its head vigorously.

As if to say, it’s fine.

Cui Dongshan smiled brightly, bending down, extending his pinky finger, “Then let’s make a pinky promise.”

The little figure, with only one arm, raised that arm and linked pinkies with Cui Dongshan, the size difference between their fingers amusingly stark.

Cui Dongshan maintained his bent posture, smiling, “Let’s stick to this for a hundred years, and if possible, even a thousand or ten thousand years.”

The little one nodded eagerly.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan switched to a fierce expression, “If you ever go back on your word, I’ll kill you, chop you up into pieces, and boil you for soup, adding scallions and garlic, sprinkling on oil and salt…”

He only got halfway through before bursting into laughter, making a funny face. As if that wasn’t enough, he opened his mouth wide and pinched his nose, making a silly face.

The little figure giggled, then lay on the ground, flailing its arms and legs.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily.

In the long years that followed, Lupo Mountain would always harbor such a little spirit.

It would remain carefree and innocent.

No matter how high Chen Ping'an’s future achievements soared, every time he returned home from an adventure, he would spend some time alone with the little one, simply sharing a few heartfelt words.

*(End of this chapter)*

 ### Chapter 419: How Many Worlds, How Many People

It seemed that Ma Xiao Dong had sensed a shift in Chen Ping An's state of mind.

Instead of calling him to her study, she chose a quiet moment late at night, when the academy was still, to take Chen Ping An on a stroll around the school. 

Casually wandering and chatting, this was how Ma Xiao Dong always was. Whether in her dealings with people or in her teaching, she adhered to a principle: the knowledge I imparted from books and the reasoning I shared are merely suggestions. It may not be suitable for you, but at the very least, it can broaden your horizons. 

As they walked past the Confucius Hall adorned with portraits of three sages, illuminated by the flickering light of a few candles in the library, they passed by dormitories where the sounds of snoring and dream murmurs could be heard.

Eventually, the two reached the summit of Donghua Mountain, overlooking the nightscape of the Daxui Capital.

In wealthy areas, the lights sparkled brightly, stretching endlessly, as if one could feel the distant songs and dances from afar.

In the poorer regions, the moonlight accompanied them, along with the simple needs of life.

Suddenly, Chen Ping An spoke, “Master Ma, I’ve come to a realization. Refining five pieces of my life-bound objects to align with the five elements is aimed at reconstructing the Changsheng Bridge. However, I still prefer to focus on practicing my punches. After all, practicing punches is akin to training with a sword. As for whether I can nurture my own life-bound flying sword and become a sword cultivator, I won’t think about that for now. So, from here on out, aside from those few key locations that might suit the placement of my five elemental life-bound objects, I will continue to nurture the pure martial aura within me to the fullest.”

Ma Xiao Dong nodded. “This plan of yours seems feasible. As for whether the results will be good or bad, let’s not worry about the harvest for now; focus on the effort instead.”

Chen Ping An responded with a hum of agreement.

In truth, Ma Xiao Dong hadn’t fully articulated her thoughts. The reason she supported Chen Ping An’s decision was that by only opening five residences and offering the rest of the territory to the pure martial aura, he was not necessarily on a dead-end path.

The human body is, in essence, a small universe, and there are also concepts of blessed lands and caves. Below the Golden Core stage, regardless of how well one manages and polishes the residences, they are merely within the realm of blessed lands. Only upon forming the Golden Core can one begin to grasp the subtleties of the cave’s tranquility. Some Taoist texts have long stated, revealing heavenly insights: “Caverns in the mountains connect to the heavens, resonating with all mountains, united with the same qi of heaven and earth, becoming one.”

Only those who have formed the Golden Core can truly be called “us.”

This saying has gained immense popularity, accepted as a guiding principle by all Qi practitioners, undoubtedly rooted in profound origins.

Ma Xiao Dong refrained from saying more because she believed that as long as Chen Ping An continued to advance step by step, he would inevitably reach that point. If she revealed it too early, presenting a beautiful vision too abruptly might shake the fragile balance he had managed to achieve.

Teaching is never easy; one must be exceedingly cautious. Crafting a beautiful jade requires painstaking precision, ensuring not to damage its essence or spirit, which is incredibly difficult; how could one not deliberate and reconsider?

Taking a step back, wasn't Chen Ping An's approach towards that girl named Pei Qian similar?

It was just that Chen Ping An himself was not yet aware of it.

Ma Xiao Dong spoke softly, “Regarding the concept proposed by our teacher that human nature is inherently evil, we disciples have had our own realizations over the years. Some have followed our teacher into silence, denying themselves and altering their ways. Others hesitate, plagued by self-doubt. Some exploit this philosophy to gain fame, claiming to stand apart from the crowd, asserting they will swim against the tide and uphold the teachings of our teacher. Such variations in human hearts are numerous; within our nearly severed lineage, we see a chaotic blend of human conditions. Just think, how complex are the legacies of the Sage of Rites and the Sub-Sage, with true disciples scattered across the world?”

Chen Ping An felt a gentle pat on his shoulder from Ma Xiao Dong. “The road ahead is long and arduous.”

He chuckled wryly, “I only have two shoulders.”

Ma Xiao Dong laughed heartily, “I’m just observing how others carry their burdens effortlessly while I stand by and watch the tides.”

Chen Ping An couldn’t help but smile in understanding, recognizing the saying as an old adage from his hometown.

———

Later that night, Pei Qian and Li Huai hid outside a small courtyard. They had agreed to don black masks together, pretending to be assassins, and stealthily “assassinate” Cui Dongshan, who enjoyed sleeping in the green bamboo corridor.

With so many martial arts novels read, they couldn’t let that knowledge go to waste!

Pei Qian generously lent a bamboo sword to Li Huai.

The two discussed their plan, deciding that it was crucial not to enter through the courtyard gate but to scale the walls instead. Otherwise, they wouldn’t truly embody the demeanor of skilled masters or the dangers of the martial world.

Liu Guan and Ma Lian wanted to join, hoping to be the vanguard for Pei Qian, the princess. However, she firmly refused, declaring that they were merely inexperienced young knights, lacking the skills to confront a great demon and would only be courting death.

They arrived at the quiet path outside the courtyard wall, employing the same technique they had used before to leap over. Pei Qian was the first to vault onto the wall, tossing her trusty walking stick down to the eager Li Huai below.

Li Huai managed to leap up without a hitch, earning an appreciative glance from Pei Qian, who admired how he puffed out his chest and styled his hair like someone else.

However, as they landed, Pei Qian moved like a cat, whereas Li Huai landed with a loud thud.

Pei Qian scolded, “Li Huai! What’s wrong with you? Making such a racket, it’s like beating a drum in battle! This isn’t about charging into the enemy’s lair for a secret assassination. Let’s start over!”

Feeling guilty, Li Huai didn’t retort but quietly asked, “So how do we leave the courtyard now?”

Pei Qian glared at him. “We take the front gate. We’ve already failed this time anyway.”

They exited through the unlatched courtyard gate, returning to the small path outside.

Cui Dongshan, lying in the corridor, rolled his eyes.

With her walking stick in hand, Pei Qian declared, “I am a cold-blooded, iron-willed person of the martial world.”

Li Huai mimicked her, saying, “I am a merciless assassin. I kill without blinking, stirring up storms of bloodshed in the martial world…”

Pei Qian frowned. “Why are you babbling so much? It only weakens your aura. Look at those famous knights in the books; their nicknames are usually just four or five words. Any more than that, and it just sounds ridiculous.”

Li Huai found this reasonable, pretending to don a conical hat and imitating someone adjusting it while holding onto his bamboo sword at his waist. “I am a merciless assassin and swordsman.”

The two climbed onto the wall again, this time landing quietly.

Then, Pei Qian and Li Huai rolled on the ground in the courtyard.

This was a step they had “planned in advance,” as they both felt directly charging up the steps to stab Cui Dongshan would be too dull.

After rolling and getting back on their feet, they crept up the steps, each readying their bamboo sword and knife. Just as Pei Qian was about to strike down the infamous martial world “great demon,” Li Huai suddenly shouted, “Demon, die!”

Pei Qian abruptly halted, turning to glare at Li Huai, who froze in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

Pei Qian asked, “Aren’t you supposed to be a stealthy assassin? Why shout before killing?”

Li Huai suddenly understood.

Pei Qian stomped her foot. “Do it again!”

Li Huai repeatedly apologized.

Neither of them regarded the “demon” with any seriousness.

They again rushed towards the courtyard gate.

Cui Dongshan sat up, exasperated. “This helpless great demon is more exhausted than both of you.”

Outside the courtyard, Pei Qian lectured, “Li Huai, if you keep messing around, I won’t take you on adventures anymore.”

Li Huai promised, “I absolutely won’t mess up again!”

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “Right now, I’m just a named disciple, with a lower status in the gang than you. After I achieve this remarkable feat that will shake the martial world, do you think Sister Bao Ping will promote me to a minor leader?”

Li Huai nodded. “Definitely! If Li Bao Ping is unclear on rewards and punishments, no problem, I can let the minor leader position go to you, and I’ll just be your deputy.”

Pei Qian replied with a haughty tone, “I never expected you, Li Huai, to have mediocre martial skills but still possess the heart of a true hero.”

Li Huai retorted, “Assassin, swordsman!”

Consequently, both received a light smack on their heads. “It’s so late! What are you still doing here?”

Upon seeing Chen Ping An, Pei Qian kicked Li Huai, and Li Huai boldly declared, “I invited Pei Qian to help me eliminate the great demon Cui Dongshan.”

Chen Ping An chuckled, “Alright then, leave the great demon to the peerless swordsman to deal with. You two aren’t skilled enough yet; we’ll talk about it later.”

Pei Qian retrieved her bamboo sword from Li Huai and went to sleep in a side room of the courtyard. Previously, she had been sleeping in the school dorm with Li Bao Ping, but tonight was an exception.

Chen Ping An took Li Huai back to the dormitory.

On their way, they encountered a familiar night-patrolling teacher, the gatekeeper surnamed Liang, an obscure Nascent Soul cultivator. Chen Ping An made up an excuse for Li Huai to evade punishment.

The old teacher was amiable and didn’t mind at all, instead chatting with Chen Ping An for a moment.

Li Huai felt particularly proud, wishing the entire academy could see this scene and envy him for having such a friend.

After bidding farewell to the old teacher, Chen Ping An ruffled Li Huai’s hair and said something Li Huai couldn’t quite grasp at the moment, “I can do this, but you shouldn’t think you can do it often.”

Li Huai replied, “Don’t worry, I’ll study hard from now on.”

Chen Ping An continued, “Whether studying is good or not, and whether you have talent, is one thing. But your attitude towards studying is equally, if not more important, than your achievements in studying. This often has a more lasting impact on one’s life. So when you’re young, working hard to learn is never a bad thing. Later, even if you don’t study or engage with the teachings of sages, when you pursue other interests, you’ll have become accustomed to putting in the effort.”

Li Huai seemed to understand yet not understand fully.

As they walked, Chen Ping An casually drew a line in the air. “For example, this line represents each person’s life path. The origins and outcomes of all our emotions, mindsets, and understandings will unconsciously gravitate towards this line. Aside from the academy’s teachers and our master, the vast majority of people will eventually drift further away from reading, books, and the teachings of the sages. However, our attitude and the context we have towards life may already exist along this line. The paths we take in life will follow this context, even if we are unaware of it. But this line will influence us throughout our lives.”

Then, at the end of that line, he sketched a circle. “I’ve traveled far, met many people, and understand your nature. That’s why I can intercede with the old teacher, allowing you to stay out past curfew tonight without punishment. But you can’t do that for yourself yet. Your current freedom is much smaller than mine. You still can’t contend with the ‘rules’ because you don’t yet understand what true rules are.”

Li Huai stared blankly at Chen Ping An, suddenly wearing a mournful expression. “I don’t quite understand. I can barely remember this. Chen Ping An, do you feel like you’re leaving the academy? It sounds like you’re saying goodbye.”

By then, they had reached Li Huai’s dormitory. Chen Ping An kicked Li Huai’s backside playfully, laughing, “Get lost.”

Li Huai rubbed his rear as he approached the door, glancing back.

Chen Ping An stood still, waving goodbye to him.

It was always like that.

———

Upon returning to Cui Dongshan’s courtyard, Chen Ping An found Lin Shouyi and Xie Xie both in the midst of their cultivation.

Once a Qi practitioner embarks on the path of cultivation, especially before reaching the realm of Golden Core earth immortals, they often do not distinguish between day and night.

Cultivators must continuously sever ties with the mundane world, cultivating a pure heart and desires.

Chen Ping An sighed softly.

He began practicing the Tiandi Posture, walking upside down.

Using pure martial aura to nourish his organs and meridians.

Legends say that once a martial artist reaches the seventh stage of their golden body, they can attain the remarkable state of not having any breath enter or exit through their nose.

Upon reaching the tenth stage, the same level as the elder Cui and Li Er and Song Changjing, one can truly become a small universe unto oneself, akin to an ancient deity descending upon the mortal realm.

Those skilled in utilizing their aura can breathe life into rivers, causing them to flow backward, or evaporate lakes and boil seas. They can also remain untainted amid great plagues, impervious to all evil.

Such is the principle.

Chen Ping An suddenly recalled his journey to the Upside-Down Mountain, where he had encountered a tall woman on the street.

At that time, his vision had been limited, and he couldn’t discern much. In retrospect, she was likely a tenth stage martial artist!

A martial artist in harmony with the Dao merges with heaven and earth.

Cui Dongshan was not present in the courtyard.

He stood atop Donghua Mountain alongside Ma Xiao Dong.

Cui Dongshan remarked bluntly, “In terms of teaching and imparting knowledge, you are far behind Qi Jingchun. You are merely patching up the windows and walls, while Qi Jingchun is building houses for his students.”

Uncharacteristically, Ma Xiao Dong did not retort.

Cui Dongshan continued slowly, “Zhao Yao has had a life of comfort, gifted and gentle in nature. He must be taught to let go of certain things, to understand the hardships of this world, and only then will he truly know the value of what he has learned. Song Jixin appears arrogant and sharp but is actually insecure and timid inside. He needs some teachings from the Legalists close to Confucianism to strengthen his heart and clarify his principles. As for governing a country, one must abandon small cleverness in favor of great wisdom, not straying far from Confucianism, ultimately leading to the right path. As for my teacher, he is accustomed to having nothing, with a heart that is extremely hardened yet unanchored. He must learn to take hold of certain things, then continuously read and learn from people, using the principles he gradually refines as the ballast for navigating the turbulent sea of life. This is what it means to teach according to one’s aptitude; there is no discrimination in education.”

Finally, Ma Xiao Dong spoke up, “I do not deny I am inferior to Qi Jingchun, but that does not mean I am inferior to you, Cui Zhan.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “Compared to someone like me, you, the Grand Master of Ma, don’t feel embarrassed?”

Ma Xiao Dong curled her lip, dismissing his words.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, “When will you officially step into the fifth realm? I’ll prepare a congratulatory gift for you then.”

Ma Xiao Dong was reluctant to answer that question, her mood heavy. “Will there be serious problems at the Sword Qi Great Wall? With so many schools of thought currently so active, all betting on the various secular dynasties of the Nine Continents, it greatly defies common sense. I can’t shake the feeling…”

Ma Xiao Dong hesitated, choosing not to continue.

Cui Dongshan sighed, “The world of Haoran believes that those convicts are defending against the demon race. It’s a matter of duty for the warriors of the Nine Continents, as well as a natural obligation. As for the truth and the outcome, we shall wait and see.”

Ma Xiao Dong turned to look at him.

Cui Dongshan gazed into the distance. “Put yourself in their shoes. If you were to leave behind the remnants of the demon race in the world of Haoran, would you want to return to your roots? If you were a convict, would you want to speak to the world of Haoran about the feelings you’ve held back for countless years?”

Ma Xiao Dong frowned. “There have always been three saints at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “Let alone a wild world, even half of one, if they are willing to unite as one, willing to pay any price to conquer a Sword Qi Great Wall and then devour several continents of the Haoran world, wouldn’t that be difficult?”

Ma Xiao Dong replied, “I don’t think it’s easy.”

Cui Dongshan didn’t deny it, simply saying, “Read more history books, and you’ll know the answer.”

Ma Xiao Dong hesitated for a moment. “The closest to the Upside-Down Mountain is a Chen Chuan An who shoulders the sun and moon!”

Cui Dongshan replied slowly, “There are some people in history who died early, leaving a good name through the ages, while others died late, leaving a stench for ten thousand years.”

Just as Ma Xiao Dong was about to say something else, Cui Dongshan turned to him with a smile. “I’m just talking nonsense here; you’re taking it seriously?”

Ma Xiao Dong said, “If the truth proves you’re talking nonsense, I’ll buy you a drink.”

Cui Dongshan grinned, “As expected of a scholar who is about to enter the Jade Purity realm; with improved cultivation comes greater capacity.”

Ma Xiao Dong looked outwards.

In the world of Haoran, the territory was vast; although there were skirmishes across the continents, for the most part, it resembled the prosperous Daxui Capital, with songs and dances. Children only read about rivers of blood and corpses in books, while adults measured their daily lives by the costs of cooking oil, rice, and salt. Scholars, laboring hard, dreamt of becoming farmers by day and officials by night. Many who had already become officials, even as the political scene changed around them, would still feel guilty towards the teachings of sages late at night, occasionally yearning for the lofty mountains and bright moons.

Cui Dongshan looked at the student from the literary lineage he had once held in low regard, suddenly rising on tiptoe to pat Ma Xiao Dong’s shoulder. “Rest assured, in the world of Haoran, there are still people like my teacher and your little disciple. Besides, there’s still time. For instance, Xiao Bao Ping, Li Huai, and Lin Shouyi, they will all grow up. Oh, what’s that saying again?”

Ma Xiao Dong recited a famous saying from her teacher, “Blue comes from indigo but surpasses it.”

Cui Dongshan coughed lightly, “To be honest, the reason the old scholar could say that is due to my significant contributions. I might as well share with you some amusing anecdotes about this. Back then, the old scholar and I passed by a dye house and encountered a graceful young girl…”

Ma Xiao Dong grabbed Cui Dongshan’s shoulder and flung him off the summit of Donghua Mountain, angrily cursing, “You little brat, are you addicted to talking nonsense?”

———

In the wild world, March hung in the air.

A massive abyss resembling an ancient well.

This place is revered as the Hall of Heroes in this realm.

It is said that this was once the battlefield where a powerful ancient demon fought against a wandering Daoist who rode a cow.

The epic battle has been depicted dramatically in this world, but only a few great demons know the truth. In fact, the battle was real, but it was not between the demon and the cow-riding Daoist; it was a far older and more tragic conflict. At that time, a highly ranked demon had spent thousands of years climbing out of its bonds, enduring great hardships to reach the well’s mouth, only to have the Daoist, standing above, lightly press down with a finger, sending it tumbling back to the bottom.

Now, at the top of this “well,” there were enormous seats arranged in a circle.

Fourteen in total, with heights uneven.

Some looked like shattered mountains turned high platforms, others resembled parts of ancient heavenly palaces, and there were even colossal corpses floating in the endless void.

Among them was a grand throne made of accumulated bones, on which a great demon with bones as white as jade held a cup, stepping lightly on a skull.

A towering column, inscribed with ancient runes, stood in the void, where a scarlet serpent coiled, and dim dragon pearls slowly spun in the air.

A tattered gray robe hung in the air, without any substance, billowing in the wind.

A robust figure clad in golden armor, covered with a mask, had golden light flowing like water from the seams of the armor, resembling a blazing sun trapped deep within the well.

A woman wearing a crown and a black dragon robe, with a human head and serpent tail, dragged her long tail into the abyss. Countless ethereal women, tiny compared to her giant form, embraced pipa instruments, with colorful ribbons entwined around their graceful figures, numbering in the hundreds. Bored, the woman rested her chin on one hand, while with the other, she popped the pipa-playing women like balloons.

A Daoist in a snow-white robe, his face obscured, stood three hundred feet tall. Compared to the other thrones, he seemed incredibly small, yet a crescent moon illuminated behind him.

A broad-chested giant with three heads and six arms sat on a mat made of stacked golden books, with a striking scar across his chest, inflicted by a sword strike from a legendary swordsman from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

None of the great demons present had participated in the earth-shattering battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Most of the concealed existences had been awakened from an endless slumber.

A small portion had been famous for millions of years, yet had chosen to ignore the battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall, opting to observe coldly.

The two great demons who had visited the blind old man in the Ten Thousand Mountains did not qualify for a seat here.

The fourteen seats encircled a hovering stone slab in the center.

As an old man’s figure gradually appeared in the center, two ancient great demons hurriedly manifested, seemingly terrified to appear after the old man.

The elder scanned the surroundings.

One seat remained empty, with only a knife left behind.

That seat was the most recently added to this Hall of Heroes and, besides the elder, had the third highest throne.

The elder said nothing.

In this wild world, more than anywhere else, true strength is revered.

The owner of that knife had once fought secretly in two life-and-death battles against the swordsman from the Sword Qi Great Wall, yet they also shared brotherhood over drinks, and had casually helped the blind old man move mountains in the Ten Thousand Mountains.

Next to the elder was a “middle-aged man” in a Confucian robe, seated upright without revealing his true demonic form, appearing as small as a mustard seed.

This person’s position was even higher than that knife.

Including the Confucian-clad great demon, all the great demons present stood up to show respect to the elder.

The elder spoke, “There’s no need to wait for him; let’s begin the meeting.”

Only then did the demons slowly take their seats.

The elder looked towards the Confucian-clad great demon. “Whatever you say next, everyone present will follow. If anyone disagrees, I will persuade them. For those who agree, afterward…”

The Confucian-clad great demon smiled and added, “They will pay lip service.”

The elder nodded. “Then I’ll have to personally speak to him.”

———

In the wild world, a muscular man was followed by a boy who looked like he carried a sword on his back.

The man was neatly dressed, looking fresh and tidy, while the boy, trudging along behind, was ragged and looked like a mixed breed, which would earn him ridicule in this realm.

In this barren land, filled with miasma, being able to walk with a human form itself was a powerful symbol.

This man had fought with A Liang and shared drinks with him. The boy was bound with a mechanism called a sword rack, making it appear as if a peacock was displaying its feathers when he looked back at the long swords filling it.

In the world of Haoran, the young man Cao Ci from the Daduan Dynasty was being dragged around by his friend Liu Youzhou, traveling the world. Cao Ci never visited martial temples, only literary ones.

As they traveled, he fought demons and eliminated evil with his bare hands, while Liu Youzhou merely watched from the side, applauding.

When Cao Ci crossed the Sword Qi Great Wall and the gate to the Upside-Down Mountain, he quietly entered the sixth stage while simply practicing his punches as usual.

With his overwhelming martial luck flowing everywhere, it nearly caused the martial temple nearby to collapse, as the luck continued to flow like a flood, directly strengthening the martial luck of this nation greatly.

In the world of Qingming, a scarred youth, filled with righteous fury, climbed a mountain to beat a drum to the heavens.

After a moment of silence in the world, a young Daoist, wearing a lotus crown, appeared beside the youth with a smile, ready to take him as a disciple.

A white jade capital with five cities and twelve towers shook violently.

From that moment on, the Daoist ancestor gained a new inner disciple.

On Baoping Continent, at the Daxui Dynasty’s cliffside academy.

Pei Qian and Li Bao Ping sat on the high branches of a tree, watching below.

Chen Ping An was practicing his punches.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 420: The Sword Immortal on the Lake, Flowers Blooming by the Path

Three days later, on a brisk morning, Chen Ping’an was preparing to leave the Cliffside Academy.

Li Baoping noticed that Li Huai, Pei Qian, and the others had been frequently sneaking off to gather together. Even her little master uncle had been disappearing now and then, which left Li Baoping feeling a bit downcast.

That day, Li Baoping arrived early at Cui Dongshan's courtyard, hoping to see her little master uncle off.

The previous night, Pei Qian hadn’t slept beside her either, but she had borrowed the Narrow Blade Talisman and a silver gourd from her.

As Li Baoping stepped into the courtyard, she found it empty.

Could it be that her little master uncle had slipped away again?

Turning on her heel, Li Baoping was about to dash toward the foot of the mountain when she spotted Cui Dongshan yawning as he walked down the path from afar. Li Baoping quickly stepped in place, ready to shoot off like an arrow, and asked urgently, “Where’s my little master uncle? How long has he been gone?”

Cui Dongshan looked bewildered. “He left early. Didn’t you know? It was in the middle of the night last night.”

Li Baoping halted in her tracks, frowning, her round face only slightly sharpening at the chin.

Cui Dongshan sighed, seeing that the girl was about to burst into tears. He hurriedly comforted her, “Don’t think too much; it’s definitely because my master is afraid to see you like this. Wasn’t it the same last time? Your little master uncle had already changed into new clothes and boots but still didn’t go to the academy. I was the only one with him while he kept looking back.”

Li Baoping sniffled.

Cui Dongshan tentatively suggested, “How about I accompany you to the lake to clear your mind and talk about my master?”

Li Baoping pondered for a moment and nodded.

The two made their way to the lake.

The sky was dimly lit, and the area was deserted. In the past, there would have been a few scattered students reciting the classics here, but today it felt particularly quiet.

Cui Dongshan led Li Baoping to a high platform by the lakeside and suddenly asked, “Little Baoping, I think it’s really unkind of your little master uncle to leave without saying goodbye. Don’t worry; as long as you don’t acknowledge him as your little master uncle, I won’t recognize this master either. Am I being loyal?”

Li Baoping glared at him. “What are you talking about? There’s only a little master uncle who doesn’t want Li Baoping; there’s no Li Baoping who doesn’t want her little master uncle!”

Cui Dongshan pretended to understand, “Oh, I see.”

He snapped his fingers.

Suddenly, a brilliant golden halo lit up along the paths by the lake.

It was a lightning pool drawn by the immortal sword's golden tassel, and at this moment, Cui Dongshan removed part of the illusion.

Li Huai appeared in the distance on the lakeside path.

He was holding a white deer, wearing a conical hat like someone else, with the Narrow Blade Talisman hanging from his waist and a silver gourd swaying at his side.

Li Baoping was momentarily taken aback.

After walking a short distance, Li Huai proclaimed loudly, “I, Li Huai, have been in seclusion for three days and have finally mastered impressive martial skills. This time, I’m descending the mountain to test my prowess against the heroes of the world!”

Cui Dongshan snapped his fingers again.

At the same time, two figures appeared not far from the high platform, with Zhu Lian and Shi Rou playing the roles of bandits, respectively beating up the “scholarly students” Lu and Lin Shouyi.

Li Huai shouted, “Stop!”

Zhu Lian blocked Li Huai’s path and bellowed, “You still need to pay a toll, hand over your life savings!”

Li Huai laughed heartily. “You blind little thieving rat dare to rob me, Li the Hero? Today, I’ll be the one to uphold justice; come at me if you have the guts!”

Zhu Lian floated forward with a series of light steps, seemingly employing the ethereal movement technique of a master. He threw punches at Li Huai’s chest, but Li Huai stood firm, laughing up at the sky.

Zhu Lian was shaken, as if struck by lightning. His body trembled like a sieve, his voice quaking, “This... this young hero… such deep internal strength!”

Then, he flew backward, convulsing a couple of times, presumably dead, much like a side character in a chivalry novel. Just being able to utter a line in front of a hero was already a good show of his role.

Shi Rou tentatively followed up, lightly slapping toward Li Huai.

Li Huai waved his hand dismissively and laughed, “Get lost!”

Shi Rou seemed to be buffeted by an unseen force, spinning in mid-air and landing a distance away, prostrating on the ground. She raised a hand, pointing at Li Huai, struggling to suppress her shame and indignation, “Who on earth are you? I’ve never heard of such an unfathomable master in the martial world!”

Li Huai extended a palm, held it up in front of his chest, and imitated a monk’s speech, “My apologies, my apologies. My martial arts are just too high, and I didn’t manage to hold back.”

Li Huai then walked closer to the high platform, glancing around. “Remember, I am Li Huai, the leader of the Dragon Spring County faction, the East Hua Mountain branch, and the head of the academy! In the martial world, I’m known as the ‘Invincible Fist and Feet’ Li the Hero. Our faction leader is the one who shakes the world and unifies the martial art community—Li! Baoping!”

Li Baoping crossed her arms, nodding slightly.

Cui Dongshan snapped his fingers again, and Li Huai, the white deer, Zhu Lian, Shi Rou, and the others vanished from sight.

At that moment, Yu Lu and Xie Xie appeared on either side of the lake, one standing and playing the flute, the other sitting and playing the guqin, like a pair of immortal lovers from the martial world.

The flute played a soft tune, while the guqin chimed melodiously.

The music grew increasingly spirited and impassioned.

On the opposite bank of the lake from the high platform where Li Baoping stood, a thin black figure suddenly appeared after Cui Dongshan smiled. The figure dashed forward, leveraging a walking stick for support, leaping high into the air and diving toward the lake, drawing a bamboo sword and bamboo blade from the waist, spinning gracefully as they landed, exuding a fierce aura.

Every time Pei Qian landed on the lake, a golden flower bloomed beneath her feet, so she needn't worry about falling into the water.

Pei Qian first demonstrated a move with her bamboo sword called the White Ape Dragging Blade, charging forward with the momentum of a tiger, shooting out several feet before shouting at Cui Dongshan’s high platform, delivering a heavy slash.

Then she tapped her toes, stepping onto the golden flowers conjured by Cui Dongshan, twisting her body suddenly, she tucked the bamboo sword back at her waist and continued to race forward with her self-created Crazy Demon Swordplay.

Pei Qian felt that she had been diligent in her martial studies, preparing for the day she might face the wildest dog.

She believed this unique skill of hers was unmatched in the world.

She executed her swordplay with great gusto, flowing seamlessly.

Once she stood firm, she put away her bamboo sword.

Pei Qian stood just seven or eight feet from the high platform on the lake’s surface, her wrist twisting as she suddenly produced the hand-spun gourd, raising it high and calling out, “There’s nothing good in the martial world, but the wine is decent. Who’s willing to share a drink with me?”

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, his sleeves billowing as he darted toward Pei Qian. He reached out, snapping his fingers, catching the silver gourd in one hand while drawing two streams of water essence from the lake to make wine; one swirled around the silver gourd, the other floated around Pei Qian's hand-spun gourd.

The two stood side by side, one tall and one short, both pretending to drink.

Then, as if they had practiced countless times, they began to stumble and sway drunkenly, moving sideways like crabs, arms spread wide with sleeves fluttering like waves. Finally, they mimicked the little girl in the red dress, stomping in place, jumping around.

This scene made Li Baoping, who stood alone on the high platform, smile broadly.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan sat down, sleeves fluttering, pulling out something from nowhere and starting to sing.

It was a comical song adapted from a folk tune of Dragon Spring County about stinky tofu.

Cui Dongshan sang loudly, “Waiter, I’ve read some books, learned many characters, and accumulated a bellyful of knowledge, but it’s worth not a few coins.”

Pei Qian had already put away her hand-spun gourd, puffing out her chest and raising her head high, circling around Cui Dongshan, “Stinky tofu is delicious but hard to buy!”

“On the mountain, there are spirits and monsters; in the lakes and rivers, there are water ghosts. Startled, I turned around, only to find I’ve been away from home for many years.”

“Frightened, I quickly ate a piece of stinky tofu to calm my nerves!”

“Which girl carries the fragrance of orchids? Why does she cry and ruin her face? You say it’s pitiful, right?”

“Eating stinky tofu, oh, stinky tofu is as fragrant as orchids!”

“Ask the master how to deal with it; there’s a little kite hanging on a branch, basking in the sun.”

“Climb the tree and take down the kite, then go home and eat stinky tofu!”

“If a deity comes to burn incense at the grave, the descendants’ bones have long been buried for a hundred years. Isn’t it laughable?”

Cui Dongshan was blabbering nonsense, while Pei Qian was momentarily taken aback, but she shrugged it off and chimed in, “Huh? Who exactly eats the stinky tofu?”

“You speak your logic, and I have my fists. In the martial world, when will these disturbances and grudges ever end?”

Cui Dongshan continued to mess with the song, while Pei Qian feigned being a little drunk, swaying side to side, “Stinky tofu with wine, I’m full yet not thirsty, and it doesn't matter what the martial world means.”

“Everyone says immortals are good; I see no leisure on the mountain…”

Pei Qian glared at Cui Dongshan, who wouldn’t stop altering the folk tune, and shouted, “If you keep this up, I might get full on stinky tofu!”

Cui Dongshan ceased his teasing of Pei Qian, stood up, and asked, “Having eaten stinky tofu and drunk wine, where’s the Sword Immortal?”

Pei Qian looked just as surprised and replied, “Yeah, we have the wine; where’s the Sword Immortal?”

The two turned to look at the high platform and echoed, “Should we call out and see?”

Li Baoping took a deep breath and called out loudly, “Little Master Uncle!”

Cui Dongshan snapped his fingers, and Li Huai and the others reappeared.

Everyone gazed toward the peak of East Hua Mountain.

Li Baoping turned her head to look as well.

A flash of snowy white descended swiftly from the mountaintop.

With a formidable presence, it landed gracefully on the lake’s surface.

Draped in a golden robe that billowed like a waterfall, Chen Ping’an stood upon the serene mirror of the lake.

He did not carry the Sword Immortal but had a sword-raising gourd hanging from his waist.

Chen Ping’an extended a hand.

Cui Dongshan produced a long sword from nearby, deftly drawing it and mimicking Li Baoping’s catchphrase, “Let’s go!”

The sword unsheathed, slicing through the air.

Chen Ping’an caught it, the blade tracing arcs in the air, held behind him as he formed a sword gesture with his fingers in front of him, laughing heartily, “People say that the snow is grain and bricks make mirrors; they’re fools! I choose to go against the current, to crash into that southern wall! Drinking the wine of the martial world, I seek to understand the principles of life. I have one sword after another, each faster than the last. One day, I’ll present my sword, and it shall be the most extraordinary and joyous sword in the world…”

Chen Ping’an began to glide over the lake like a dragonfly skimming water, his sword moving fluidly as if swept by the wind, his body slightly turning to the right, and his left foot lightly stepping forward. His right hand gripped the sword, rotating with him, slightly pulling back as his eyes followed the blade. Suddenly, his right foot transformed into a bow stance, the sword slicing upward in an arc. 

“An immortal lifts their garment as the sword exits the sleeve, following the movement of the sword, the eyes fixed on the tip, where the mountain and river lie.”

With grand strides, Chen Ping’an moved forward, the sword following, its intent continuous yet varied, abrupt yet fluid. He suddenly halted, flicking his wrist as the sword tip shot up like a white python tasting the air. Then, the long sword left his hand, swirling around him like a little bird, each swoop circling Chen Ping’an, who moved with an innate harmony of spirit and martial intent, executing a six-step stance. The flying sword followed, and with Chen Ping’an’s final punch, it landed heavily on the sword hilt, causing the flying sword to spin around him, its light flickering like the bright moon on the lake.

Chen Ping’an extended an arm, his fingers brushing precisely over the hilt of the flying sword. With a grand sweep of his sleeve, the sword shot off for several dozen feet, following Chen Ping’an’s slow advance, tracing circles that gradually grew larger, illuminating the entire lake in dazzling light, the sword energy palpable.

“By night, I visit the Water God Temple; by day, I pay homage at the City God Pavilion. In a small boat on the Jiao Long River, the immortal carries their sword in formation… People say reason is the most useless; I assert that within books lies the essence of the Sword Immortal, every word glimmering with sword light, teaching the sages to behold my sword’s boundless spirit!”

Li Baoping clapped her hands vigorously, her face flushed with excitement.

Chen Ping’an took down the sword-raising gourd, tossed it casually, and summoned the sword to his hand. One sword extended, the tip perfectly pressing against the wine gourd.

His swordplay was even more free-spirited than Pei Qian’s Crazy Demon Swordplay.

Yet no matter how he swung the sword, the sword-raising gourd remained steady at the tip, not moving an inch.

Chen Ping’an was unaware that Cui Dongshan had already dispelled the lightning pool created by the golden sword energy.

While outsiders couldn’t hear the words spoken, many in the academy could see his graceful sword wielding.

---

A group stood at the academy entrance.

Chen Ping’an already had the Sword Immortal slung over his back along with a large bamboo box.

Pei Qian carried a slung bag, holding a walking stick, with blades at her waist.

Zhu Lian and Shi Rou stood to the side.

After a brief conversation filled with whispers, Li Huai and Pei Qian agreed to set off together on future adventures, then quietly told Chen Ping’an, “When you get to Dragon Spring County, remember to check on my house.”

Chen Ping’an nodded, smiling. “No problem.”

He then turned to Li Baoping, Lin Shouyi, and Li Huai, saying, “You all go to class now; there’s no need to see me off. We’ve already delayed enough time, and I doubt the teachers will want to see me anytime soon.”

Li Baoping didn’t insist on accompanying her little master uncle to the gates of the Great Sui Capital, nodding, “Little master uncle, be careful on the road.”

Chen Ping’an ruffled her hair. “Do I still need you to say that?”

Li Baoping beamed at him.

Chen Ping’an made a bow to Mao Xiaodong as goodbye.

Mao Xiaodong nodded back, stroking his beard with a smile. “Come often in the future.”

Finally, Cui Dongshan insisted on escorting the master to the end of White Mao Street.

Pei Qian and Baoping exchanged some whispers, their heads huddled together. Eventually, Pei Qian was all smiles, satisfied that she had snagged the little leader!

Chen Ping’an and Cui Dongshan walked slowly at the front, exiting the main street and turning into White Mao Street. Finally, at the end of White Mao Street, Cui Dongshan came to a stop and spoke slowly, “Master, I don’t feel that the world today has become worse than it used to be. There are more and more cultivators on the mountain, and those below are living in plenty. What do you think?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “It should be so.”

Cui Dongshan looked up at the sky, murmuring, “But it cannot be denied that the peaks rising above the earth, like swords pointing to the heavens, appear less frequently every century or millennium. So I hope that all our joys and sorrows don’t just become the pecking of caged birds outside, the chattering of sparrows in their nests, or the mournful cries of cicadas on the branches.”

Cui Dongshan pointed upwards. “In the higher skies, there should always be a few cries of cranes far away; though distant, they evoke melancholy. Once seen and heard, they become hard to forget.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled. “It’s good that you can think this way.”

After a moment of hesitation, Chen Ping’an said, “Master hasn’t read much yet, and my knowledge is shallow, so I can’t provide you an answer right now, but I’ll think more about it. Even if I still can’t answer in the end, I’ll let you know. If you can’t figure it out, then the student has troubled the master. At that time, don’t laugh at me.”

This was perhaps the first time Chen Ping’an acknowledged that he was Cui Dongshan’s master.

Cui Dongshan’s face lit up with a brilliant smile, and he suddenly bowed deeply, rising and softly saying, “In my hometown, flowers bloom along the path; master can return slowly now.”

Chen Ping’an helplessly replied, “But it’s already autumn.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head vigorously, “May your heart remain spring-like through all seasons.”

 ### Chapter 421: The Landscape Remains the Same

The journey back home from the capital of the Great Sui to Longquan County in the Great Li was one that Chen Ping'an knew all too well.

He still preferred to take the mountain paths, where the surroundings were deserted. When not practicing his Earthly Pole walking technique, he would have Zhu Lian help him train in martial arts. Their sparring sessions became increasingly serious, with Zhu Lian progressing from the Sixth Realm to the peak of the Seventh Realm, his movements becoming more powerful and dynamic. This worried Pei Qian, who thought to herself, if it weren't for Master wearing that golden robe, he would have spent a fortune on new clothes! During their first match, Chen Ping'an had to call it off halfway through because his boot had gotten a tear, forcing him to remove it and continue barefoot.

After leaving the borders of the Great Sui, Chen Ping'an switched to straw sandals, much to Pei Qian's delight. He even made her a pair, which made Little Black Charcoal less amused. Although straw sandals were sturdy and often more reliable than regular boots on the mountains and in the water, they were still rough on the feet. Fortunately, Chen Ping'an didn’t insist that Pei Qian wear them all the time. When she pricked the blisters on the soles of her feet with a needle, Zhu Lian was nearby, making teasing remarks. The old man and the young girl had grown used to their daily banter.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an sat beside a stream, barefoot in the water, his thoughts drifting away.

He couldn't say he felt timid about returning home, but compared to his first journey back, he had many more concerns now—the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, the bamboo loft on Luopo Mountain, the mountain-buying matter that Wei Bo had mentioned, the business at the two shops on Qilong Alley, the repairs to the clay Buddha statues and heavenly official figures at the Immortal's Tomb. There were many things that Chen Ping'an hadn’t thought about before, constantly on his mind. As for returning to Longquan County, he planned to visit Shujian Lake first to see Gu Can, then head to the Color Garment Kingdom to check on the couple there, along with the old woman who could whip up a mean home-cooked meal. He also wanted to meet the old Sword Saint Song Yu from the Shuishui Kingdom and treat him to a hotpot meal, wanting to show off a bit in front of the old man. His beloved girl liked him too, and it wasn't as terrifying as what the old Sword Saint had said.

Chen Ping'an admired the literary and refined demeanor of figures like Cui Dongshan, Lu Tai, and even Liu Qingshan from Lion Garden. While he naturally yearned to be like them, it didn’t mean he would blindly gravitate toward them.

This was what they called being fond of the new while not dismissing the old, and it was why his possessions kept piling up.

Chen Ping'an thought it was a good habit, akin to his talent for naming things, and it was one of the few things that made him feel a little proud.

Suddenly, he turned to Pei Qian and said, “In the future, when you’re out roaming the Jianghu with Li Huai and the others, don’t feel too constrained, and definitely don’t feel the need to copy me everywhere.”

Pei Qian blushed. “I want to learn from Master, but I just can’t seem to do it.”

Zhu Lian laughed, “Ah, Pei Qian, I’m going to compile a ‘Manual of Flattery’ one day, and it’ll sell like hotcakes in the Jianghu. When that happens, we’ll share the profits fifty-fifty!”

Pei Qian replied earnestly, “You can’t go back on your word. We’ll split it right down the middle!”

Zhu Lian poked her lightly. “You, my dear, will never escape from a lifetime of chasing after money.”

Pei Qian imitated Li Huai, shaking her head and making a silly face. “Not listening, not listening! Just some nonsense!”

Chen Ping'an chuckled knowingly. “I heard from Li Huai that you all decided to treasure hunt together from now on?”

Zhu Lian teased, “Oh my, a pair of immortal lovers already making lifelong commitments at such a young age!”

Pei Qian retorted angrily, “Li Huai and I are just good friends in the Jianghu! No romance involved! Old chef, stop talking nonsense!”

Then she immediately switched her tone, smiling at Chen Ping'an. “Master, you don’t have to worry about me getting distracted in the future. I’m not one of those Jianghu girls who swoon at the sight of a man. If Li Huai and I find any valuable treasures, we agreed to split them evenly, and you can be sure my share will go straight to you!”

Chen Ping'an just smiled in response.

Afterward, the group smoothly made their way to the county town of Huangting, located by the Yu River. Chen Ping'an had come here once with Cui Dongshan and had seen several sword cultivators soaring through the skies. It was quite a chaotic scene, and at the time, he hadn’t intervened; with his then-current strength, he couldn’t do much but watch coldly.

As the saying goes, “A small temple attracts big demons.”

Not to mention the southern territories of the Great Li, even within the Great Sui's borders—let alone the capital of the Qingluan Kingdom—cultivators didn’t dare to act so recklessly.

Yet, in these smaller vassal states and their major cities, the local celestial masters and wild cultivators were exceedingly indulgent, and even when common folks were affected by disasters, they simply resigned themselves to misfortune. There was no one to demand justice. The imperial court was unwilling to intervene, and local officials dared not take action. Even if righteous heroes were outraged, they were often powerless.

In this county town, it was here that Cui Dongshan had subdued the inkling of a true form born from the literary breath of the Cangshi family's library, a girl in a pink skirt, as well as a mischievous young boy in a blue shirt who caused trouble in the jurisdiction of the river god.

The girl in the pink skirt was a manifestation born from the renowned poems and essays of the world, known as “Literary Spirits.” As for the blue-clad boy, according to Wei Bo’s letters, he seemed to have some connection to Lu Chen. This young boy, now responsible for overseeing Baiyu Capital, wanted to take the blue-clad boy with him to the Qingming Realm, but the boy had not agreed. Thus, Lu Chen left behind a golden lotus seed and requested that Chen Ping'an help the blue-clad boy transform into a dragon in the rivers and lakes once he arrived in Beijulu Prefecture.

Chen Ping'an had no objections to this, nor did he harbor much doubt.

The county town remained lively; it seemed that the change in tribute from the Gao clan of the Great Sui to the Song clan of the Great Li did not affect the common people of Huangting much. Life continued at a leisurely pace.

However, it was rumored that the Great Li Iron Cavalry was southbound, and one of the cavalry units was advancing along the border between the Great Sui and Huangting.

It didn’t cause any major upheaval in the political scene of Huangting, but as they ventured deeper into Huangting, discussions among the townsfolk grew increasingly animated. There was a palpable sense of pride in being subjects of the Great Li, and the initial doubts about the emperor's wise decisions had transformed into overwhelming approval.

At the same time, places like Ziyang Prefecture, Yu River, Han Shi River, and the Five Peaks were among the first to be recognized as celestial residences and water deities by the Great Li court, enjoying a moment of unparalleled glory.

As dusk approached and they entered the city, Pei Qian was undeniably the happiest. Although they still had quite a distance to cover before reaching the borders of the Great Li, they were getting closer and closer to Longquan County. It felt as if every step she took was a step closer to home, and she radiated joy.

Zhu Lian, however, felt little about it. He probably still regarded himself as a rootless reed, floating about without a destination, merely changing the scenery he observed. Yet, he was genuinely curious about Longquan County, which had once been a small cave heaven, especially after learning about a boundary master residing on Luopo Mountain. He was eager to see for himself.

Only Shi Rou felt anxious.

With Chen Ping'an's sporadic chatter and Cui Dongshan's descriptions of how hidden talents lay in Longquan County, Shi Rou felt that carrying the remnants of a celestial being to that place would be akin to a lamb entering a tiger's den.

Especially after Cui Dongshan jokingly remarked, “It’s not easy being a remnant of a celestial being,” which made Shi Rou even more worried.

Upon entering the city, Chen Ping'an first bought some miscellaneous items, then chose a bustling tavern to share a few drinks with Zhu Lian. He also purchased two jars of wine before looking for an inn to stay at.

As Chen Ping'an walked through the bustling streets of the county town again, he did not encounter any carefree sword cultivators.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have minded if they injured people; he would have simply knocked them off their flying swords with a punch.

As for any subsequent disturbances that might involve some mountain patriarchs, he wouldn’t have cared.

After passing through the Hanging Mountain and the territories of the two continents, it became clear that vassal states like Huangting typically had few Golden Core Earth Immortals, who were the leaders of their respective realms, unattainable. Moreover, if he truly encountered a Nascent Soul cultivator, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t dare to claim he could win, but with Zhu Lian, a formidable martial artist, standing by his side, and Shi Rou, who could safely devour a Nascent Soul cultivator’s life sword and come out unscathed, escaping wouldn’t be too difficult.

For instance, back in the day when they had stayed at the private residence of the old deputy minister of the Huangting Kingdom, named Cheng, hidden within the mountains, he was a renowned Confucian scholar of the northern literary scene known for his celebrated work, “The Iron Sword Light Verse Collection.”

Later, Chen Ping'an learned that the old deputy minister had actually traveled through the history of Huangting Kingdom under various identities and appearances. He had once warmly hosted Chen Ping'an and his party when they happened to pass by.

The elegant courtyard was located near a great cliff, a picturesque site that attracted many visitors.

Later, Cui Dongshan leaked some secrets: the old deputy minister was a long-dormant ancient Shu dragon, and thanks to his student’s introduction, he had been recruited by the Great Li court as the vice-head of the Cloud-Peeking Mountain’s Deer Academy. The old dragon’s eldest daughter was the founding ancestor of the Ziyang Sect, the leading sect on the first mountain of Huangting Kingdom, while his youngest son was the water deity of the Han Shi River. Among them, the old dragon’s daughter was a Golden Core female dragon, who, due to her limitations in aptitude, had attempted to use unorthodox methods to break through the Golden Core bottleneck to reach the Nascent Soul stage. Unfortunately, she still fell short, and it would be a hundred years before she could hope to advance further.

As a dragon, she was naturally gifted in cultivation, but once she reached the Golden Core stage, progress became incredibly challenging.

The greatest opportunities in the Li Pearl Cave back then included the golden carp belonging to the Great Sui prince Gao Xuan, that stubborn little four-legged snake that refused to stay at Chen Ping'an’s ancestral home, and the fire dragon that became a bracelet on Ruan Xiu’s wrist. There was also Zhao Yao’s temporarily dormant wooden carving of a chi-long that served as a paperweight, along with the mud eel that Chen Ping'an had caught and gifted to Gu Can. These treasures were coveted because they would seamlessly help their owners advance to the Nascent Soul stage. Whoever could raise one would essentially have a companion with combat strength equivalent to that of a Jade Talisman Realm cultivator.

In the sparsely populated Baoping Continent, where Fifth Realm cultivators were few and far between, who wouldn’t be envious?

Moreover, these five dragons were closely related to the true dragon bloodline. Once they recognized their master, they would share a soul bond, continuously nourishing their owner's physical body, effectively granting them a physique comparable to that of a pure martial artist at the Golden Body stage.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to lead the way into an inn, he and Zhu Lian turned to look down the street.

A tall woman with a cold expression approached, smiling as she reached them. In perfect Da Li dialect, she said, “Young Master Chen, my father is friends with the North Mountain Deity Wei Bo of your Great Li, and he currently serves as the vice-head of the Lin Deer Academy. He once hosted you during your visit to the Huangting Kingdom. Before leaving, my father instructed me that if you ever pass through this area again, I must extend my hospitality and not be neglectful. Not long ago, I received a letter from Piyun Mountain, and I have been waiting around here for quite some time. If my presence has caused any discomfort to you, I sincerely apologize. Here, I humbly invite you to be my guest at the Ziyang Sect for a few days.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Since I’m in a hurry to continue on my way, would it trouble you if I politely decline today?”

The tall woman, who was the daughter of the old dragon and the founding ancestor of the Ziyang Sect, smiled. “Of course not; however, I truly hope you can stay at the Ziyang Sect for a day or two. The scenery there is quite nice, and we have some local specialties worth showing off. If you don’t accept my invitation, I won’t be scolded by my father or the Mountain Deity. But if you do me this favor, my father and Wei Deity will surely remember this small act of kindness.”

After a moment’s hesitation, Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile. “Alright then, we’ll trouble you for a day or two.”

The tall woman, a remnant of the ancient Shu dragon lineage, took out a small, finger-sized wooden boat, tossing it to the ground. As mist enveloped the area, it transformed into a three-story, intricately designed lofted ship, capable of accommodating forty to fifty people. As she tossed the magical artifact, she subtly waved her sleeve, guiding the pedestrians on the street to the sides.

At the same time, she produced a stack of colorful talismans from her sleeve, letting them fall to the ground. Suddenly, a group of graceful, beautiful young women appeared, radiant and captivating, unrecognizable from the sheets of talisman paper they had been moments ago.

They quickly and adeptly moved a plank from the ship.

The tall woman smiled, “Please, Young Master, board the ship.”

Pei Qian watched with wide eyes, thinking that she wanted to have both a lofted ship and these talismans in the future, even if she had to sell everything to get them, as they were just too impressive!

Chen Ping'an patted Pei Qian on the head and led her to follow the tall woman onto the ship.

Under everyone’s gaze, the lofted ship slowly ascended, riding the wind at great speed, covering ten or more miles in an instant.

Standing on the celestial ferry of the Ziyang Sect’s ancestor, beneath their feet lay the winding Yu River stretching nearly a thousand miles.

Chen Ping'an stood by the railing with Pei Qian, gazing down at the picturesque landscapes below.

He couldn’t help but recall his hometown and the various counties and market towns along the way to Longquan County—those majestic mountains and clear waters that he had traversed were firmly etched in his memory.

He also thought of some people from his hometown.

Among his classmates who had followed Master Ma out of Li Pearl Cave, Li Huai and Lin Shouyi eventually caught up with Chen Ping'an.

Dong Shuijing had chosen to stay in their hometown, while Shi ChunJia had moved with his family to the capital of the Great Li.

Chen Ping'an had a good impression of them; one was genuine and warm, probably due to their similar backgrounds, and he had felt a sense of closeness to them back then. The other was a lively girl with braided horns, who seemed clever and bright.

Chen Ping'an didn’t believe their choices were wrong.

Deep down, he hoped that the mountains and waters of his hometown remained the same, whether it was Dong Shuijing and Shi ChunJia who stayed behind or Liu Xianyang, Gu Can, and Zhao Yao who had already departed. In their hearts, the green hills and flowing waters of their hometown would always remain.

Of course, on this journey back home, Chen Ping'an still had to visit the haunted residence of the bride ghost who hung high amidst the scenic waters and winds.

There were some words he had kept bottled up that he needed to share with her.

 ### Chapter 422: A Good Gentleman

As dusk settled, Dong Shuijing hung up the "Closed" sign at his wonton shop but didn’t rush to shut the door. After years of doing business, he knew that some customers who had promised to return after climbing the mountain might take a little while longer. So, even with the sign in place, he waited for about half an hour. However, he didn’t expect the two new apprentices at the shop to stay with him. If a customer did arrive, it would be Dong Shuijing himself who would cook; he wouldn’t let these two impoverished boys share in his burdens.

Dong Shuijing's wonton shop was gaining more and more fame. Many wealthy folks from the newly established county town of Longquan had invited him to open additional branches there, but Dong Shuijing politely declined each offer.

Besides this wonton shop located halfway up the mountain near the shrine, Dong Shuijing had used the substantial sum he made from selling one of his ancestral homes in the town to buy half a street of properties in the new county town. He kept only one residence for himself and rented the rest out.

He was among the first locals to seize opportunities in the area. Among the neighbors of his two ancestral homes, many were elderly people who had lived there their whole lives. Stubborn and set in their ways, even when outsiders offered exorbitant prices for their ancestral properties, they steadfastly refused to sell. They believed that they could sleep on piles of silver at night or fill their coffins with wealth to take to the afterlife. Those young scions from the mountain, finding their reasoning incomprehensible, tried to negotiate but ultimately left empty-handed with their bags of gold and silver.

However, when Dong Shuijing visited, he didn’t know whether it was the nostalgia felt by the elderly for the young man they had watched grow up, or whether he was simply persuasive, but they sold him their properties at prices far below what the outsiders had offered. Dong Shuijing made several trips to the Jiao Horn Mountain, and with each visit, he made considerable profits. Coupled with some unexpected gains from his own hard work, he gradually purchased various plots of land from officials like Governor Wu, County Magistrate Yuan, and Supervisor Cao. Unbeknownst to him, he became one of the wealthiest individuals in Longquan's new county town. Rumors began to circulate about "Dong Bancheng" (Dong the Half City), a name that struck both awe and fear.

Today, after chatting about trivial matters with his two young apprentices, Dong Shuijing remained alone in the shop. He prepared a steaming bowl of wontons for himself as a reward. With dusk deepening and the autumn chill intensifying, after finishing his meal and cleaning up, he stepped outside the shop and glanced at the incense-burning path leading up the mountain. Not seeing any customers, he planned to close up. Unexpectedly, a young gentleman in a scholar’s robe appeared, coming down from the mountain. Dong Shuijing recognized him, greeted him with a smile, and invited him in. He prepared another bowl of wontons and brought out a jar of his homemade rice wine. They deliberately conversed in the Longquan dialect, with Dong Shuijing speaking slowly, fearing the young man might not understand.

The guest was a peculiar character named Gao Xuan, who claimed to be a student from the Bixun Mountain Forest Deer Academy, studying in a foreign land. His Da Li dialect was a bit clumsy, yet he insisted on learning the local dialect from Dong Shuijing.

After Gao Xuan finished his wontons, Dong Shuijing poured two bowls of rice wine. For the wine to be rich and mellow, the quality of the water and glutinous rice was crucial. Longquan had an abundance of good water, and the glutinous rice was procured at a price far below market value from a certain Supervisor Cao overseeing the kiln operations. This led to the establishment of a sizeable rice wine production facility in Longquan County, which had begun selling to the capital of Da Li, still not yet a daily gold mine but with promising prospects. The local taverns in the Da Li capital were gradually recognizing Longquan rice wine, and the existence of the Li Zhu Cave with its assorted divine tales only added to its allure. Dong Shuijing managed to secure this business opportunity with the help of County Magistrate Yuan, intertwining it with the approval of Wu Yu, the county governor, and the logistics facilitated by Supervisor Cao.

Among Governor Wu, County Magistrate Yuan, and Supervisor Cao, Wu Yu held the highest rank. Although he was still a relatively junior official, being the youngest governor in Da Li, he was not someone to be underestimated. After all, his mentor was the national teacher Cui Zhan. Unfortunately, since his promotion, Wu Yu's reputation had suffered, as it was said that during the transition from county to district, he had faced considerable pushback from the local aristocracy, making his situation quite difficult.

However, Wu Yu had the support of a good mentor, something others could only envy.

Conversely, the latter two, County Magistrate Yuan and Supervisor Cao, were highly regarded in the Da Li officialdom. Not only were they both scions of prominent families, but they were also thriving in their respective fields within Longquan County. County Magistrate Yuan played a part in the construction of the mountain residences of the immortals to the west, and his contributions to the successful commencement and completion of the immortal tomb and the Wenzheng Temple were well-recognized. The local gentry might not acknowledge Wu Yu as governor, but they willingly accepted the authority of the county magistrate, whose title was lesser.

As for Supervisor Cao's office, it appeared to oversee the production of royal porcelain, but in reality, it bore the secret task of monitoring the mountain forces in Longquan County.

The two most esteemed surnames in Da Li, Yuan and Cao, were akin to fire and water. As the Da Li cavalry split into three divisions heading south, two of those divisions were backed by the two noble houses.

Dong Shuijing’s ability to win the favor of all three through a seemingly insignificant trade could only be described as a "happy accident."

In truth, while the rice wine business was indeed Dong Shuijing’s idea, the intricate planning and interconnected steps had been orchestrated by someone else.

When Dong Shuijing later inquired about this, asking why the illustrious heirs of County Magistrate Yuan and Supervisor Cao were willing to engage in this small profit venture, he learned that last year, the three had shared a profit of seventy thousand taels of silver, while Yuan and Cao together had merely totaled fourteen thousand taels. Compared to typical market trades, this seemed like a windfall, and while future profits would steadily increase, Dong Shuijing couldn’t comprehend their motivations after learning the general wealth of the Yuan and Cao families.

The person who explained it to him shared that in this world of commerce, businesses could be categorized not just by size or value, but also by the nature of the profits—clean versus dirty money.

Making a fortune in cutthroat ventures was a skill, and earning a steady income through honest small trades was also commendable. Moreover, many small businesses, when perfected, could transform into genuine pathways to wealth, solidifying the foundations of noble families over generations.

Finally, the man took out an ordinary copper coin, placed it on the table, and pushed it toward Dong Shuijing, who was sincerely seeking advice. “Even the grand fortune of the Liu family from Aiai Continent started with the first copper coin. Think about it.”

That enigmatic figure, who still carried a sword on his back, departed, claiming he was heading to the Da Sui capital, hoping to encounter the merchant’s forefather, an old gentleman who, despite his youthful appearance, had once garnered trust from the world through his remarkable powers.

Dong Shuijing pondered for a long time and then recalled that the man had eaten two large bowls of wontons and drunk a jar of rice wine, finally leaving with just a single copper coin.

However, having grown accustomed to the meticulousness of business, Dong Shuijing didn’t feel shortchanged; instead, he felt he had gained.

Noticing Dong Shuijing lost in thought while drinking, Gao Xuan smiled and asked, “Are you troubled? Feel free to share; I might not be of help, but I can listen to you vent.”

Dong Shuijing shook his head and joked, “Just daydreaming about some future matters, nothing to complain about. Every day when I return to the county seat, I’m dead tired, count the money, then collapse into bed, and when I open my eyes, it’s a brand new day—busy, yes, but fulfilling.”

Gao Xuan sighed, “I really envy you.”

Dong Shuijing was at a loss for words. He didn’t feel Gao Xuan was merely lamenting for the sake of it; every family has its troubles, and wealth doesn’t necessarily solve everything. So, he didn’t respond and took another sip of his homemade rice wine. The shop's wine jars had all had their red paper labels removed, as they could attract unwanted attention, turning a simple place meant for tranquility into a den of chaos. Even now, only a handful of people in Longquan County knew the true extent of Dong Shuijing's wealth, as various divine beings mingled in that place.

After settling the bill, Gao Xuan said he would continue up the mountain to spend the night at the mountain shrine, hoping to catch the sunrise from the peak. Dong Shuijing handed him the shop key, saying he could stay inside if he changed his mind—at least it was a place to shield him from the wind and rain. Gao Xuan politely declined and ascended the mountain alone.

Dong Shuijing then descended and unexpectedly bumped into Xu Ruo, who had presumably just returned from the Da Sui capital. Xu Ruo expressed a desire for a bowl of wontons to fill his stomach before heading to the Jiao Horn Mountain ferry to continue his journey to the Da Li capital. Dong Shuijing had no choice but to return, open the shop door, and prepare two large bowls for the Mo family hero without offering rice wine, feeling too lazy to be courteous. He sat across from Xu Ruo, watching him eat ravenously.

“Mumbling and unclear,” Xu Ruo asked, “Can you guess who that young man was just now?”

Dong Shuijing hadn’t given it much thought. His interactions with Gao Xuan were devoid of ulterior motives, and he enjoyed such exchanges. He was naturally inclined to business, but business wasn’t everything. Yet, since Xu Ruo had brought it up, and not being foolish, Dong Shuijing answered, “Is he the son of the Gao family from the Da Sui dynasty? Here as a hostage for our Da Li?”

Xu Ruo nodded.

Dong Shuijing hesitated for a moment before asking, “Can we avoid doing business with Gao Xuan?”

Xu Ruo chuckled, “What’s wrong with that? The reason I mention this is to help you understand a principle.”

Dong Shuijing straightened up and said, “Please, go ahead, sir.”

It was only in such moments that Dong Shuijing referred to Xu Ruo as "sir."

Xu Ruo glanced at the shop counter, prompting Dong Shuijing to quickly retrieve a jar of rice wine and place it on Xu Ruo's table. Xu Ruo took a sip of the lingering rice wine and said, “In small businesses, hard work is essential. Once you grow, while hard work remains important, information will become increasingly crucial. You must hone your ability to uncover the details that others overlook, as well as the ‘information’ hidden behind those details. One day, it will prove invaluable. Don’t harbor any resentment over it; the world is vast, and knowing information doesn’t mean you must harm others’ businesses. Good trades are always mutually beneficial.”

Dong Shuijing nodded in understanding.

Xu Ruo then asked, “What do you think of Wu Yu, County Magistrate Yuan, Supervisor Cao, and Gao Xuan? How would you describe their personalities?”

Dong Shuijing slowly replied, “Governor Wu is gentle, County Magistrate Yuan is strict, Supervisor Cao is suave. Gao Xuan is aloof.”

Xu Ruo pressed further, “Why do you think so?”

Dong Shuijing had already considered this and answered without hesitation, “Governor Wu’s mentor, National Teacher Cui Zhan, is currently prominent. Governor Wu must remain humble and not become complacent; it’s easy to attract unnecessary envy and attacks. The Yuan family is traditionally cautious. If I recall correctly, their family motto emphasizes gathering and preserving. The Cao family has many military descendants, with a bold character. As for Gao Xuan, being a Da Sui prince and having fallen to this place, he naturally feels somewhat disheartened. Even if he harbors resentment, he must at least appear calm on the surface.”

Xu Ruo replied, “That’s accurate, but it only scratches the surface. Many people can think of these things, so they don’t constitute ‘information’ that can create wealth. You need to delve deeper and consider the broader political landscape, the trends of the dynasty. While it may not directly benefit your current business, developing good habits will provide lifelong benefits.”

Dong Shuijing nodded, “I understand.”

Xu Ruo smiled, “I’m not truly a merchant with secrets to share; what I can teach you is rather shallow. However, you have a talent for digging deeper, and soon, I’ll be visiting you less frequently. Also, I represent the ‘information’ of Dong Shuijing. I’m not boasting; this unique information is quite valuable. So, if you ever encounter a difficult situation in the future, you can do business with me without shame.”

Dong Shuijing acknowledged with a sound.

Xu Ruo took out a Peaceful No-Worries Token, “Your current business doesn’t quite qualify you for this Da Li token, but over the years, I’ve accumulated a few that are better left with someone else. Consider it a sign that I’ve recognized your potential early on; I’ll be seeking dividends from you in the future. Tomorrow, visit the governor's office, and you’ll soon find your name recorded in the local government and the Ministry of Rites.”

Dong Shuijing didn’t refuse and carefully accepted the token, tucking it away in his robes.

This Peaceful No-Worries Token was truly invaluable.

Across the vast northern lands of Baopinzhou, countless emperors, generals, scholars, and deities yearned to possess one.

Xu Ruo teased, “I heard your future father-in-law passed through Tongyezhou on his way back to Beijulu, and he appeared in this hometown town. Didn’t you take the chance to visit?”

Dong Shuijing found it amusing yet frustrating, saying, “By the time I heard the news, Uncle Li had already left the town.”

Xu Ruo asked with a smile, “Would you like to know how your rival, Lin Shouyi, is faring at the Cliffside Academy these days?”

Dong Shuijing nodded, “I want to know.”

Xu Ruo smiled without speaking.

Dong Shuijing directly asked, “How much?”

Xu Ruo extended a hand and picked up a jar of rice wine from behind the counter, saying, “He hasn’t yet reached the Intermediate Fifth Realm, but his reputation in the Da Sui capital is rising. If you don’t work hard, once Lin Shouyi becomes an Intermediate Fifth Realm immortal, he’ll have countless opportunities flooding to him. Even a mere flick of his fingers could yield tens of thousands of taels of pure gold and silver, easily allowing him to surpass you.”

Dong Shuijing hesitated, “I certainly don’t want to lose to Lin Shouyi, but some things aren’t just about making more money.”

Xu Ruo chuckled, holding the wine jar as he stood up, “Having some is better than having none, and having more is better than having less. Many issues that seem unsolvable by money ultimately come down to simply not having enough money.”

Dong Shuijing also stood, “Why haven’t you told me the true meaning of being a merchant with secrets? You’ve only taught me these business tricks?”

Xu Ruo smiled and countered, “Only?”

Dong Shuijing was left puzzled.

Yet Xu Ruo didn’t elaborate further and left the shop.

After cleaning up the remnants on the table, Dong Shuijing closed the shop door and headed down the mountain toward the new city of Longquan County.

The young man, who felt a bit of copper odor about him, walked under the night sky, adorned with stars.
