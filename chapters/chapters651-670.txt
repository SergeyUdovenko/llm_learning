 ### Chapter 651: The Sword Across the Knees, Lost in Thought

At the city gate of the Dragon Palace Cave, there was a cacophony of voices. The doors had been shut after a pair of young men and women entered the city.

Even the gatekeeper of the Water Dragon Sect, who practiced water magic, was unable to detect the glimmering golden light that slipped from the many plaques, falling to the ground like fireflies gathering together. The light coalesced into a young man adorned with a high crown and flowing robes, who strode boldly through the city gate. As the gate closed behind him, the gatekeeper of the Water Dragon Sect was left bewildered, for this was an unprecedented phenomenon in a millennium. He immediately flew off to send a message to the Northern Sect's Ancestor Hall.

Not long after Chen Ping'an stepped down from the white jade steps, this young man appeared beside Li Liu, performing an ancient bow of respect. His words were obscure and cryptic, and his voice sounded hoarse and aged, an odd contrast to his youthful appearance.

Li Liu, sitting still, gazed at the figure descending the mountain. Displeased by the boy’s presence, she waved her hand lightly, shifting him aside a full yard.

Standing upright, the boy felt slighted but showed no signs of anger. Instead, he glanced back at the small figure approaching the city gate and softly remarked, “The Great Way is intimately connected to water; it is indeed not easy.”

He dared not pry into the white jade steps, treating the young swordsman in green as one of her pawns.

Li Liu's expression was indifferent as she slowly spoke, “Li Yuan, the incense offerings at the middle shrine of the Ji Du (Jidu) Temple have never compared to those at the upper shrine of the Da Yuan (Dayuan) Dynasty’s Chong Xuan Department.”

The eccentric boy named Li Yuan felt a pang of guilt and replied, “I have failed my duty; I deserve to die a thousand deaths.”

The Ji Du Temple, which spanned east and west across the Northern Ju Lu (Beiju) Continent, once had three shrines. The lower shrine had long since crumbled away, the middle shrine had been transformed into the Water Dragon Sect’s Ancestor Hall, and the upper shrine was held by the Yang family of the Chong Xuan Department’s Cloud Palace.

Li Liu had once met Yang Ningzhen at the Ghostly Marsh in the Bone Beach, exchanging words that left him both incredulous and compelled to believe. Yang Ningzhen, as the eldest son of the Yang family, known as the “Little Celestial Lord,” had risen to prominence among the continent's youth purely through martial prowess and an alias. Yet during the battle at Treasure Mirror Mountain, when facing Li Liu, who had only recently returned to the path of cultivation, Yang Ningzhen found himself at a complete disadvantage.

Li Liu inquired, “Failed your duty? Is it such a significant matter to watch over the incense at this small shrine?”

Li Yuan fell silent.

His golden eyes dimmed, accentuating his aged appearance.

This boy, despite his youthful looks, was one of the last two Water Spirits of Ji Du. His age might even surpass that of the founding ancestor of the Water Dragon Sect.

In the vast world, the Water Spirit was an ancient position that had not completely faded from memory, yet it was little known, often tasked with managing the incense offerings of large temples. The Central Plains would hardly pay attention to it, allowing it to wither away. Thus, each time a Water Spirit’s golden body decayed, the world lost one.

Such beings were neither governed by earthly dynasties nor overly mingled with the immortal sects.

However, in the Daoist-controlled Qing Ming world, the Water Spirit held immense significance and a structured lineage. Each large temple only had one Water Spirit, whose status surpassed even that of water gods from rivers and lakes, far exceeding the mountain deities of various dynasties.

While the Water Dragon Sect seemed to have absorbed the Ji Du Temple and used it as a foundation to resist the many arrogant sword cultivators of the Northern Ju Lu, the truth was layered in complexity.

Faced with this exceedingly noble woman, Li Yuan felt like a lowly bureaucrat in the court, fortunate to see a central celestial official, and could not afford to be disrespectful.

Being chastised in person was already a grand blessing from the heavens.

In the vast Water Dragon Sect, aside from this small Water Spirit Li Yuan, only the successive sect masters who passed down the oral tradition knew her true identity.

That piece of Chi Dragon jade pendant appeared to be a token given by the Water Dragon Sect to the offerings of the Ancestor Hall, yet it was, in fact, the very ancestor of all subsequent pendants, carefully crafted to imitate the one in her hand. The Water Dragon Sect’s cultivators at the city gate could not discern the differences, but Li Yuan could see clearly. So even though the woman’s appearance had changed and her identity in this life had transformed, he rushed here nonetheless.

Suddenly, Li Liu burst into laughter.

The compatriot from her early years in the Li Zhu Cave, whom she had never met nor spoken to, had actually sensed something amiss the moment the Water Spirit Li Yuan appeared, yet had not turned to look, quietly descending the mountain.

As a result, Li Yuan, lacking subtlety, did not immediately break the restrictions and could only linger at the city gate.

Li Liu thought for a moment and said, “That’s fine; let Mr. Chen stay here for a few days to stabilize his mind.”

This was the first time Li Liu regarded Li Yuan directly. “Li Yuan, is there a place inside with abundant spiritual energy that is also relatively quiet? If so, bring it out to entertain our honored guest. If not, have someone clear a space for him.”

Li Yuan nodded and replied, “There is.”

Even if there wasn’t, there had to be one.

For someone Li Liu referred to as “Mr. Chen,” Li Yuan, as the gatekeeper of the Dragon Palace Cave and a messenger for the incense offerings at the Ji Du Temple, would have rushed to clear the area if not for concern about creating too much disturbance.

Whether the Water Dragon Sect wanted to hold a jade ritual or a Water Official's ceremony, or if it would anger the local earth immortals cultivating in the small cave, was of no concern to him.

Li Liu instructed, “At the Water Dragon Sect, do not disclose anything. Just say an old friend’s child has come to visit. If you have a better explanation, feel free to handle it, but do not let anyone disturb Mr. Chen’s quiet cultivation here.”

Li Yuan cupped his fists and said, “I will follow the command!”

Li Liu stood and stepped forward to the city gate, saying, “Mr. Chen, passing by one of the thirty-six small caves, it would be a pity to go through without entering. Inside the Dragon Palace Cave, there are plenty of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, especially those close to water and wood. Although they are expensive, their quality is exceptional. If Mr. Chen has anything in mind, with this jade pendant, you can charge it to the Water Dragon Sect for a hundred years for anything under a hundred grains of Gu Yu money.”

Li Liu wasn’t speaking the truth.

Credit? 

The Dragon Palace Cave, which helped the Water Dragon Sect, the Yang family of the Chong Xuan Department, and the Floating Weeds Sword Lake make a considerable profit, was once one of her summer retreats. Moreover, as long as Li Liu had the thought to reclaim it, no matter how brilliant the refining methods of the Water Dragon Sect’s ancestors were or how painstakingly they managed their mountain-water formations, what meaning could it hold against her?

Furthermore, how had the founding ancestor of the Water Dragon Sect, who had once been a dull-witted mortal teacher, stepped onto the path of cultivation? What fortunate coincidences had allowed him to advance step by step? Would the successive sect masters not be aware of this?

So who was really in debt to whom? It was evident.

Every time Chen Ping'an heard the words “Gu Yu money,” he felt a pang of anxiety.

Li Liu did not hurry to take down the jade pendant, continuing, “As long as Mr. Chen’s mind is not calm, no matter how far you walk, you will still be going in circles.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Alright, then I’ll trouble Miss Li.”

Li Liu shook her head with a smile, “Mr. Chen need not be polite. Li Huai has been thinking of you for many years. Every time there was correspondence between the Cliffside Academy and the Lion’s Peak, he would mention you. This immense favor of teaching and protecting, I, Li Liu, will never forget.”

Chen Ping'an replied helplessly, “Miss Li is far too polite.”

This was true. When he took care of Li Huai on his way to the Great Sui Academy, it was merely fulfilling a promise. Besides, Li Huai had been a bit mischievous but had not caused Chen Ping'an much trouble.

Of course, that little brat’s mouth was like honey smeared with arsenic, especially when he was being cheeky, but he was ultimately just a pure-hearted child who could not hold onto grudges and remembered the good done to him.

Chen Ping'an looked up and found that the eccentric boy had vanished.

Li Liu explained, “That person is the local gatekeeper.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Is he similar to Zheng Dafu?”

Li Liu chuckled, “Their duties are somewhat similar, but compared to Uncle Zheng, it’s like the heavens and the earth.”

Recalling the past when her younger brother Li Huai was still a child, Zheng Dafu often carried him to the Yang family’s shop.

Li Huai would shout that he couldn’t hold it anymore, and Zheng Dafu would dash off, saying that a hero must hold it a bit longer, allowing him to relieve himself in the shop's backyard.

Regardless of whether Li Huai made it or not, in the end, both would take a trip to the Dragon Riding Lane to buy pastries from the new year’s shop.

Over the long years, Li Liu had seen many tranquil cultivators, pure and untainted, with unblemished hearts, detached from worldly matters.

It was only in this lifetime in the Li Zhu Cave that she encountered many “real people” irrelevant to realms, and the small places had a grand appearance, making Li Liu often reminisce.

The two walked side by side, climbing again.

It seemed that after discussing important matters, there was nothing left to engage in idle chatter.

Chen Ping'an thought too much, finding it hard to speak, worried that an accident might bring unnecessary trouble to Li Liu.

Li Liu was always carefree and unconcerned about matters.

Inside the Ancestor Hall of the Water Dragon Sect in Northern Ji Du, upon receiving the message from the Dragon Palace Cave’s gate, most of the sixteen chairs were already occupied. The remaining empty ones belonged to sect masters who were away on journeys, and aside from a Yuan Ying who had been in closed-door cultivation for many years, no one else was absent.

Among those in the Ancestor Hall was Bai Bi, a Golden Core cultivator and the current sect master of the Water Dragon Sect, Sun Jie.

There was also Wu Lingting, the mentor of the young Marquis of North Pavilion, Zhan Qing. However, as a relatively inexperienced Yuan Ying elder from a wild cultivation background, he sat further back.

Recently, Wu Lingting had been in an extremely foul mood. His only disciple, Zhan Qing, had mysteriously vanished without a trace, neither alive nor dead, which was utterly ridiculous.

If it weren’t for the well-regarded talisman master Huan Yun from the mountain, who helped Bai Bi’s little girl confirm the circumstances, Zhan Qing’s sudden disappearance would have been directly linked to Bai Bi, and Wu Lingting would have caused a ruckus in the Water Dragon Sect’s Ancestor Hall, demanding accountability from Sun Jie. So at this moment, Wu Lingting was seething with a belly full of anger, his expression extremely grim. Zhan Qing was a disciple he valued greatly, a wild cultivator from the mountains, especially since taking a direct disciple was far more significant than for a sect master to take on a student, viewed as a wild cultivator sacrificing half a life to gain the incense inheritance.

After all, wild cultivators harm wild cultivators; it was not uncommon for a master to kill a disciple or a disciple to kill a master. In contrast, no one dared to act so recklessly in the presence of a sect master with an Ancestor Hall.

The Dragon Palace Cave's doors closed on their own.

This was certainly no small matter.

Sect Master Sun Jie immediately summoned all members of the Ancestor Hall.

In the past, when the sword immortal lay low for many years, stealing treasures from the cave and successfully escaping, the process from the loss of the sect’s treasure to its retrieval had been nothing short of tragic.

The Water Dragon Sect’s Ancestor Hall had more than a dozen chairs, with the leftmost chair always occupied by the sect master, while the rightmost chair had hardly ever seen anyone sit down.

This rule had been upheld for as many years as the Water Dragon Sect’s Ancestor Hall had existed, unshakable.

Any offering or guest who inquired about this matter would be met with silence from the Water Dragon Sect’s cultivators.

The situation was simple.

Sun Jie explained in a few words.

Yet, within the Ancestor Hall, everyone wore solemn expressions.

First, a stranger woman revealed a pendant token for offerings, entered the city, and ascended the white jade steps. Then the city gates closed, cutting off the world, and attempts by the cultivators to investigate yielded no results.

The Water Dragon Sect’s female cultivator, Shao Jingzhi, who was of the Jade Purity Realm, appeared like a young woman, graceful and composed, and slowly spoke, “Sect Master, why not let me rush to the cave's harbor in the sea of clouds, and wait for the rabbit?”

Sun Jie frowned and said, “Aside from that, we must truly consider whether the entire cave should go into lockdown. If we choose lockdown, it is bound to cause unrest, affecting this year’s Golden Jade Ritual and the subsequent Water Official’s Exorcism ceremony. Our Dragon Palace Cave is renowned for its stability; this time, with two major events in succession, we shouldn’t just consider our friends in the mountains, but also the many emperors and generals from the Da Yuan Dynasty participating. A single mistake could give the Chong Xuan Department and Floating Weeds Sword Lake a handle to grasp.”

Wu Lingting scoffed, “These pampered and spoiled short-lived folks from the mountains are not very capable; they’re all just delicate and soft.”

An old woman, leaning on a dragon-headed staff and appearing half-asleep with her eyes closed, sat beside Shao Jingzhi. When she finally opened her eyes slightly and turned to glance at Sect Master Sun Jie, she hoarsely said, “Sun Nephew, in my view, it would be better to let Jingzhi take the mountain’s treasure; if there are any unscrupulous intruders, we can eliminate them cleanly. I simply don’t believe anyone can stir up much trouble in our Dragon Palace Cave.”

Wu Lingting, sitting opposite, looked somewhat admiringly at this old woman, who, despite being a Yuan Ying, was quite irritable towards everyone in the Water Dragon Sect.

Relying on her seniority, she addressed Sun Jie as “Sun Nephew,” while speaking more intimately to Shao Jingzhi.

If it were Wu Lingting in Sun Jie’s position, he would have likely slapped that old woman’s face to a pulp long ago.

Just as Sun Jie was about to speak, a sprinkle of golden light appeared on the chair across from him, gradually coalescing into a youthful yet weary-looking boy.

It was the Water Spirit of Ji Du, Li Yuan.

Li Yuan saluted Sun Jie, observing the necessary decorum.

Sun Jie also rose to return the greeting but did not reveal Li Yuan’s identity.

The old woman suddenly opened her eyes and trembled, “Li Lang? Is that you, Li Lang?”

Li Yuan felt a pang of emotion and glanced at the old woman, whose hair was now silvery. He said nothing.

The old woman’s eyes turned red, and she no longer leaned on her dragon-headed staff, gently resting it against the chair. She placed her hands on her knees, smoothing her skirt, lowering her head to look at her withered fingers, and murmured softly, “Li Lang, you still hold your charm, but alas, I have grown old, far too old. In the time since we last met, I’ve been waiting expectantly, only to be left with white hair. Now that we meet, I realize sometimes it’s better not to meet.”

Wu Lingting’s expression turned thoughtful.

What was this? 

A charming young lad and an old woman past her prime; they must have had some unfinished business in the past? 

That could indeed be quite an old tale.

This was one of the interesting aspects of the mountains; strange matters were never surprising. As long as cultivators had the spare time to mingle, lively scenes were everywhere.

Li Yuan spoke directly to Sun Jie, “Sect Master, it is my old friend’s descendant visiting. The pendant is also something I gifted long ago. I simply wish to show up and catch up. I didn’t wish to be disturbed, so I used a little method that caused the Water Dragon Sect to gather here in the Ancestor Hall. This is my fault, and I am willing to accept the sect’s punishment.”

Sun Jie smiled and replied, “Water Spirit, you are too modest. Since it’s an old friend’s descendant visiting the cave, it’s a chance for goodwill; this is a good thing for Li Water Spirit, and also a good thing for our Water Dragon Sect. How about taking our esteemed guests to my residence in the main city of the cave?”

Li Yuan smiled and said, “There’s no need to trouble the Sect Master; I will take them to Fushui Island.”

Sun Jie nodded, “If there are any needs later, Water Spirit, you can just speak up.”

Li Yuan stood, bowed to the members of the Ancestor Hall, and said, “I apologize for disturbing everyone’s cultivation by making this trip; I will make it up in the future.”

After Li Yuan finished speaking, he transformed into golden light, vanishing in an instant.

To be able to travel back and forth within a sect's Ancestor Hall like that demonstrated his remarkable ability.

In any sect’s Ancestor Hall, any offering or guest would have to enter and exit through the main gate, the same as the commoners.

Moreover, with the position of the chairs and the old woman’s lapse, everyone, including Shao Jingzhi, understood the gravity of the matter.

Thus, when Sun Jie spoke up, “It was a false alarm; you may disperse,” no one showed any signs of complaint.

Heaven knows whether that elusive “young man” bore a grudge.

Every elderly member of the Ancestor Hall, seemingly amiable, was often the most difficult to deal with.

Sun Jie was the last to leave the Ancestor Hall, and outside, Shao Jingzhi waited in silence.

After everyone had flown away on their winds, Sun Jie smiled and said, “You guessed correctly; it was Li Yuan, the Water Spirit of Ji Du, a close friend of our Water Dragon Sect’s founding ancestor.”

Shao Jingzhi’s expression darkened.

To put it bluntly, behind them, this place was not really the Ancestor Hall of the Water Dragon Sect at all. All the cultivators sitting in those chairs, though seemingly glorious, were in an awkward position, including her and Sect Master Sun Jie, who were merely guests!

Sun Jie appeared as though he was speaking casually, “Remember where you came from.”

Shao Jingzhi’s expression stiffened, and she nodded.

Sun Jie continued with a smile, “Founding a sect is not easy, and maintaining it is even harder. Jingzhi, there are some things I can let go of; after all, what’s mine will always stay mine. But if someone does something out of line, I, Sun Jie, though often deemed the least competent sect master of the Water Dragon Sect, must still put my foot down and manage it.”

Shao Jingzhi’s expression grew increasingly grim as she flew away, crossing the lake to return to the southern shore.

Sun Jie was clearly using the Water Spirit of Ji Du to send a message to her and the entire Southern Sect.

Sun Jie did not employ any techniques but shut the doors of the Ancestor Hall with his hand and slowly walked down the mountain.

In a sect, there were countless matters to attend to.

Leaving one little time to spare.

For instance, after Wu Lingting had expressed some resentment, Sun Jie promised him that in the next three selections for disciples in the Ancestor Hall, Wu Lingting would get the first pick for a named disciple.

Wu Lingting was not easy to deal with either; he asked directly what would happen if he happened to choose a good candidate from the ones Shao Jingzhi had her eye on?

Sun Jie simply replied, “The Southern Sect is also the Water Dragon Sect.”

Wu Lingting was slightly satisfied with this.

However, in reality, promises were easily made but not easily kept. A small misstep could lead to conflict with Shao Jingzhi’s Southern Sect, causing mutual resentment.

The confrontation between the Northern and Southern Sects of the Water Dragon Sect had not formed overnight; it had its pros and cons. The sect masters of past generations had both suppressed and guided it, not all were hidden dangers. However, many disciples from the Northern Sect believed that it was Sun Jie’s lack of authority that had allowed the Southern Sect to grow strong.

Thus, Sun Jie’s reminder to Shao Jingzhi today carried its weight.

Li Yuan concealed himself in the sea of clouds above the cave, sitting cross-legged, looking down at the green snails in the jade plates below.

Years spent in the mountains felt like a fleeting moment, a blink of an eye spanning centuries.

An eccentric old woman known for her idiosyncrasies stood at the peak of her mountain, gazing at the sea of clouds, lost in thought, her expression softening. It was unclear what this aging woman of the mountain was truly contemplating.

Li Yuan did not look at her.

He vaguely recalled many years ago, a reclusive and introverted little girl, who was not at all charming, and liked to wander alone on the water’s edge at night, holding a handful of stones, smashing the reflection of the moon in the water time and again.

Chen Ping'an turned to look, the city gates had opened, and tourists were once again climbing the white jade steps.

After climbing the 9,999 steps, Chen Ping'an and Li Liu reached the summit, a white jade platform covering more than ten acres. The ground was carved with a pattern of dragons, depicting sixteen coiled dragons, resembling a horizontally placed white jade dragon wall. However, unlike the auspicious atmosphere of worldly dragon walls, the twelve seated dragons carved into the ground were bound by iron chains, and blades were driven into their bodies, each displaying an expression of pain and struggle.

Chen Ping'an walked carefully between the gaps in the seated dragon patterns, while Li Liu showed no hesitation, stepping upon the bodies and heads of the dragons, smiling, “These beneath Mr. Chen’s feet are all ancient prisoners of the past; they are no longer true dragons. We walk here without taboo.”

In ancient times, true dragons were responsible for controlling the rain and clouds throughout the land, and while they could accumulate merit and receive orderly rewards, they could also suffer severe punishments for neglecting their duties. They would be skinned on the Dragon Execution Platform, have their claws and heads severed, and their true bodies and souls would be detained. Some would be executed for their heavy dereliction of duty, thrown into the water, while others might not deserve death but would lose their identities, with their blood staining the waters and mountains, giving rise to many true dragon descendants.

Chen Ping'an whispered, “Are they all still alive?”

Li Liu replied, “Most cannot withstand the erosion of time and have perished. A few are barely hanging on. The dragon wall beneath is both their prison and a form of protection. Once the cave shatters, they cannot escape death. Thus, they are considered the guardians of the Water Dragon Sect. When great enemies approach, after receiving the Ancestor Hall’s decree, they can temporarily escape and participate in battle, demonstrating their loyalty. The Water Dragon Sect has always treated them well, adding some essence of water each year to help these ancient serpents cling to life.”

Chen Ping'an grew increasingly curious about Li Liu’s vast knowledge.

However, such matters should not be pried into too deeply.

Everyone has their privacy and secrets; if both parties are truly friends, and the other is willing to share, it is a sign of trust. The listener should honor that trust by keeping secrets rather than thinking that being friends grants permission to pry into everything, let alone using the old friend’s secrets to gain the friendship of new acquaintances.

Thus, some people seem to have friends everywhere, appearing to drink with everyone as if life is a continuous feast. Yet, when faced with difficulties in life, they struggle, and when they leave the table, they find they have no friends left, only resentment for the world’s coldness. 

True friendship cannot be built without sincerity. Shrewd people rarely have friends in times of trouble, even more so.

Li Liu seemed to see through Chen Ping'an’s thoughts and spoke candidly, “The reason my parents and I moved to the Northern Ju Lu is due to certain circumstances. Compared to other continents, the environment here is more suited for my cultivation. My father wants to break through further, but remaining in the Treasure Bottle Continent offers him little hope. Here, it’s difficult, but at least there’s a glimmer of opportunity.”

The size of a continent often determines the number of cultivators in the upper five realms. The Northern Ju Lu, rich in resources, has far more spiritual energy than the Treasure Bottle Continent, hence the number of upper five realm cultivators is significantly greater.

However, the number of mountain peak warriors, especially those at the limit, does not differ much.

Among the limit warriors from the Northern Ju Lu, including the recently fallen Gu You, there were only three.

In contrast, the smallest Treasure Bottle Continent also has three: Li Liu’s father, Li Er, the feudal prince Song Changjing, and the downtrodden mountain’s Cui Cheng.

With Gu You’s death, it is a chance for all the warriors in the Northern Ju Lu to share the continent’s fortune, and how much one can gain depends on their own abilities.

This is where the saying “When a refined martial artist dies, it affects their home country; when a limit martial artist dies, it affects their home continent” is rooted.

Suddenly, Li Liu asked, “Mr. Chen, did you recently visit a small world-like mountain water secret realm?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Not long ago, I just visited an ancient site that was not recorded.”

Li Liu said, “No wonder. After Gu You’s death, the martial fortunes scattered, but among them, there was a dense martial fortune that seemed to contain Gu You’s lingering will. It lingered around the North Pavilion and Shui Xiao Kingdom for a long time, remaining for about half a month before gradually dissipating. It should be because it couldn’t find you. If you had received this gift, the possibility of advancing to the Golden Body Realm with the strongest sixth realm would be much greater. Even if someone from the Golden Armor Continent was raising their fist intent, they shouldn’t pose much threat to you. However, it’s hard to predict what might happen if they keep escalating their fists and you remain stagnant. If you break through to the seventh realm before they do, you would lose that opportunity.”

Chen Ping'an understood.

It was due to his years of practicing the Mountain Shaking Fist and receiving guidance from the late Gu You with three punches.

So even as an outsider, Gu You was still willing to share a portion of his martial fortune as a gift to him.

Missing out on Gu You’s gift would be regrettable, yet he felt no real remorse.

Holding a green bamboo walking stick in one hand and lightly clenching a fist with the other, Chen Ping'an said, “No worries. Senior Gu You is a person from the Northern Ju Lu; it’s only natural for his martial fortune to belong to the warriors of this continent. I will only train harder to live up to Senior Gu You’s expectations.”

For Chen Ping'an, this gift was divided into two parts: the martial fortune he didn’t grasp and the sentiment he must hold onto.

When the time comes for him to truly sacrifice his own interests, he will still be able to discern right from wrong, clearly make choices, and not let gains and losses disturb his state of mind; that is the true principle.

Li Liu smiled, “It shows that Senior Gu You has good judgment; my younger brother Li Huai is not bad either.”

Chen Ping'an always felt that something was off about Li Liu’s words, yet it seemed perfectly natural, as it should be.

He thought about the local customs and traditions of his hometown, and it seemed unsurprising. Just the alley where his ancestral home is located has the likes of the sword immortal Cao Xi from the Southern Pavilion, the scholar Gu Can from the Booklet Lake, and of course, himself, Chen Ping'an.

Tourists began to ascend the high platform in succession, and Chen Ping'an and Li Liu fell silent.

When there were sixteen people, sixteen misty snow-white serpents formed from clouds appeared on all sides of the high platform, their heads leaning close, each cloud-sea serpent resembling a ferryboat.

Li Liu said, “At once, sixteen people can ride the serpents, bypassing the restrictions of the small realm, smoothly entering the Dragon Palace Cave. This is also a gimmick of the Water Dragon Sect.”

Li Liu was the first to step onto the head of one of the serpents.

Chen Ping'an followed suit, stepping onto the head of the cloud-white dragon, standing steadily.

Just as someone at the high platform was about to rush forward, a figure of a blue-robed deity appeared, saying, “Below is the pit; the corpses are all from those who competed for the passage. Life and death are significant matters; you all should weigh them carefully.”

Only Chen Ping'an noticed that the figure of the blue-robed deity stood furthest from Li Liu.

The sixteen serpents, transformed from the essence of water fortune, began to slowly ascend into the sky. Just as they were about to break through the thick clouds, revealing a glimmer of golden light suspended in the heavens, they suddenly plummeted without warning.

The surroundings were shrouded in mist.

Li Liu steered her serpent to Chen Ping'an’s side and smiled, “That glimmer of gold above is the essence of the incense offerings from the Ji Du Temple, forming a sun-like shape. It is also one of the foundations of the Water Dragon Sect, though its development is slow because it lacks the right method; the embryo is rough and crooked. Based on the current rate of incense accumulation at the temple, even if the Water Dragon Sect had ten thousand years, it would still not succeed. The likelihood of the Water Dragon Sect creating its own sun and moon in the Dragon Palace Cave is far less than stealing them from Chen Chun’an’s shoulders.”

Chen Ping'an looked up, seeing only the vast, unending sea of clouds, with no trace of that golden light.

Chen Ping'an muttered, “If I were a cultivator of the Water Dragon Sect, I would make the same choice. Even if there’s only that one glimmer of light, I would still willingly accumulate incense.”

Li Liu replied, “Mr. Chen, the matter of cultivation is quite different from the path of martial artists. It’s not that one cannot emphasize the persistence of dripping water wearing through stone, but once a cultivator solely focuses on this, it won’t work. A Qi Practitioner may live long, but they cannot withstand sitting in the mountains for several rounds.”

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, “Noted.”

About a stick of incense later, the cloud serpents gently swayed, their four claws touching the ground, and the mist around them dispersed, revealing a clear view.

Chen Ping'an found himself standing atop a sea of clouds.

Looking down, he saw an imposing city built on a massive island, resembling the capital of a dynasty, surrounded by lush mountains, with radiant treasures flowing around.

Outside the island’s grand city, there were various large and small islands, each boasting ancient architecture, nestled against mountains or by waters, like stars encircling the moon, protecting the central city as if it were at the center of heaven and earth.

The emerald waves stretched for miles, seemingly endless.

Suspended above the sea of clouds were numerous green-colored talisman boats, some as small as a flat-bottomed boat and others as large as warships.

The Water Spirit Li Yuan stood not far away.

Li Liu led Chen Ping'an toward the young man whom even the direct descendants of the Water Dragon Sect’s Ancestor Hall did not recognize.

Li Yuan guided them to a large boat. After they boarded, there were no visible actions, nor any cultivators seen on the ferry; the boat set off on its own.

Li Yuan softly said, “Fushui Island is rich in water fortune and spiritual energy, uninhabited for a hundred years, allowing Mr. Chen to stay there to cultivate, not far from the old site of the palace, reachable by the talisman boat in half an hour.”

Li Liu nodded, “Thank you.”

Li Yuan felt a bit uneasy, his heart not fully at ease.

Li Yuan cautiously asked, “Would you like me to arrange for some nimble maidservants on Fushui Island?”

Li Liu replied, “Why ask me? Ask Mr. Chen.”

Li Yuan immediately turned to inquire of Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “It’s already quite a bother; there’s no need to go through such trouble.”

Li Yuan said no more.

Above the sea of clouds, a slightly conspicuous tall building stood. A Yuan Ying cultivator stationed at the top of the building saw the dragon pendant hanging from the young girl and the boy and withdrew his inquiring gaze.

However, there was some doubt. Most of the offerings and guests of the Water Dragon Sect were known to each other, so why were these two unfamiliar faces? Could they be related to the Chong Xuan Department and Floating Weeds Sword Lake?

As long as the two pendants were genuine, the old Yuan Ying guarding the sea of clouds would not cause any unnecessary trouble.

This boat flew like a sword, not stopping at the ferry of Fushui Island, but directly hovering over a deserted courtyard of a celestial mansion, the plaque reading “Dragon Palace Stopping Clouds.”

As the three disembarked, the gates of the mansion slowly opened.

Li Yuan explained, “Fushui Island was once a cultivation place for an old offering of the Water Dragon Sect, who passed away a hundred years ago. The disciples inside have little to show for themselves, and a Golden Core cultivator, in an attempt to force a breakthrough, secretly sold Fushui Island back to the Water Dragon Sect. After he luckily became a Yuan Ying cultivator, he traveled to other continents. The other disciples had no choice but to move out of the Dragon Palace Cave.”

The three crossed the threshold together, and Li Yuan continued, “Aside from this cultivation mansion, Fushui Island also has a spring pool, the Stone Caves of Yongle Mountain, the site of the Iron Workshop, and the Stele of Ascending Immortality. The island is uninhabited and ownerless; Mr. Chen can freely explore these places during your cultivation leisure.”

Finally, Li Yuan took down the jade pendant from his waist, one side carved with a dragon pattern, the other inscribed with ancient script reading “Jun Qing Yu Xiang,” and handed it to Chen Ping'an. “Mr. Chen, this item is the key to the mountain-water formation of Fushui Island. There’s no need to refine it; simply wearing it allows you to control the formation. Yuan Ying cultivators cannot investigate the island’s mansion, and Jade Purity Realm cultivators who try to spy here will trigger a ripple in the great formation.”

Li Liu seemed fairly satisfied.

This place was evidently Li Yuan’s private residence.

As for the tales of the Water Dragon Sect’s offerings passing away and the disciples’ infighting, Li Liu certainly remained unconcerned.

What was true or false had nothing to do with her.

Chen Ping'an did not decline the jade pendant, thanking Li Yuan before accepting the heavy token and hanging it on the side of his waist beside the one he received from the Water Dragon Sect.

At this moment, Li Liu finally removed her pendant, which was inscribed with the words “Three Feet of Sweet Rain,” smiling as she handed it to Chen Ping'an. “Mr. Chen, consider this as helping my brother repay some kindness.”

What she meant was that it need not be returned.

This scene made the Water Spirit Li Yuan’s eyelids tremble.

If it were him, he would probably kneel down to receive thanks.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, saying, “This gift is too heavy; I cannot accept it without returning the favor.”

Li Liu said nothing further, simply handing the jade pendant to Chen Ping'an.

Li Yuan didn’t dare look any longer and, with utmost respect, took his leave.

Thus, Chen Ping'an hung three tokens by his waist.

Li Liu and Chen Ping'an walked together in the mansion, planning to make a brief stop before leaving this place, which held no fond memories.

When the time came to leave, how would Chen Ping'an repay it? Did Li Yuan have the courage to take charge of that jade pendant?

As a small Water Spirit of Ji Du, did he not fear being drowned?

How many deities of fire had been killed by flames?

How many water gods of heaven and earth had been subdued by her with great floods?

Chen Ping'an pulled out a statue of a deity from his belongings, smiling, “Miss Li, I originally planned to give this to Li Huai when I met him next, but now, you can help me deliver it to him.”

Li Liu’s gaze softened suddenly, seeming to transform into that girl from the small town who used to carry a bucket to the ancient well for water, gentle and unassuming, with no sharp edges.

She accepted the small gift, raised her hand to shake it lightly, and joked, “See, I’m different from Mr. Chen; I never hesitate to accept heavy gifts, and I do so with peace of mind.”

Chen Ping'an felt a little lighter, smiling, “I should learn from Miss Li.”

Li Liu looked at the young man with the warm smile and felt a pang of emotion.

Her younger brother, Li Huai, when he traveled far, seemed like the most ordinary child in the academy, incomparable to Li Baoping, Lin Shouyi, and others.

During the journey through the Great Sui, Chen Ping'an treated Li Huai with normalcy.

Even when her father Li Er appeared later, Chen Ping'an still approached Li Huai with the same demeanor.

Now that she had appeared in the Water Dragon Sect, it remained unchanged.

You are Li Huai’s sister, Li Er’s daughter; regardless of your realm or opportunities, I, Chen Ping'an, will do my best not to trouble you. As long as I know you are doing well, I will be happy, and that’s it.

To be kind to others and strict with oneself.

This is what a true scholar is about. Today, not being a true teacher doesn’t mean one won’t be in the future.

Thus, Li Liu smiled, “So you don’t think I only bring bad news. There are two things I must congratulate Mr. Chen on.”

Chen Ping'an’s eyes brightened; could it be that the lotus root fortune didn’t require two to three thousand grains of Gu Yu money, and that was an overestimation from the Downtrodden Mountain side?

Li Liu said, “This sword has actually long been a celestial weapon.”

Chen Ping'an was left stunned.

That robe of the sword immortal from the Dragon Pool could be upgraded to a celestial weapon tier by feeding it a large amount of metal coins, a truth he had long known, but had yet to realize due to lack of resources.

But how had this sword suddenly transformed from a semi-celestial weapon into a legendary celestial weapon?

Li Liu revealed the secret, “The sword bears a hint of the righteous aura and contains a drop of refined Dao intent.”

Chen Ping'an fell into contemplation. The latter he could understand, for the sword immortal had refined the fragmentary sword qi given by Daoist Sun.

But where did the former righteous aura come from?

Li Liu said no more on the matter, “Also, staying on Fushui Island, Mr. Chen can freely absorb the surrounding water fortune spiritual energy without any worries. This small loss won’t concern the Dragon Palace Cave, as it is Fushui Island’s rightful share.”

“There’s also a piece of not-so-good news, which is that the one named Li Yuan will help send a letter to the Downtrodden Mountain, and there won’t be any traces left.”

Li Liu paused, “I will explore the main city of the Dragon Palace.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Miss Li, please be sure to inform me before you leave the Water Dragon Sect, so I can return the jade pendant.”

Li Liu smiled helplessly.

Chen Ping'an also found it quite amusing; he had indeed guessed right about Miss Li’s little schemes.

Li Liu nodded, “Alright, before leaving, I will make a trip to Fushui Island.”

Chen Ping'an made no further attempts to retain her.

Li Liu transformed into a rainbow and departed, leaving no trace of spiritual energy ripples in the world.

It was akin to the aura of sword immortal Li Cai.

Chen Ping'an wandered around the mansion, preparing to find a suitable quiet place for cultivation, intending to roughly survey the place before checking out the spring pool and the stele of ascending immortality.

Li Liu silently soared into the sky and then landed near the mansion before heading toward the sea of clouds.

She considered it a promise kept.

In the sea of clouds, the Water Spirit Li Yuan stood with his hands clasped.

Li Liu asked, “How is it in the Ancestor Hall of the Water Dragon Sect?”

Li Yuan succinctly replied, “All is well.”

Li Liu smiled, “Li Yuan, you’re left with only some hard work.”

Li Yuan broke into a smile.

Li Liu then asked, “What’s your relationship with that old woman?”

As long as she was within the Dragon Palace Cave, she felt superior to all other worldly celestial beings.

Li Yuan shook his head, sighing, “I regret scaring a little girl while pretending to be a water ghost back then.”

Li Liu lost interest and instructed Li Yuan to keep an eye on Mr. Chen’s cultivation. Then, she casually opened the heavenly curtain, and as she broke into the Ji Du waters connecting with the small cave, she vanished in an instant, disappearing hundreds of miles away, more stealthily than any celestial being’s earth-shrinking techniques.

In any rivers, lakes, or seas, all belonged to Li Liu’s jurisdiction.

In truth, regarding Chen Ping'an’s matters concerning the Water Spirit, Li Liu was perhaps the most qualified person in the world to comment, yet she simply chose not to speak on it.

Chen Ping'an first selected a place for cultivation and then wandered alone, observing the ancient sites around, before returning to the mansion and taking out six pieces of Daoist green bricks to lay on the ground, beginning to practice his stances.

He had hung the sword immortal on the wall, leaning his walking stick against it.

After finishing his martial arts practice, Chen Ping'an went to a study to write a letter to Zhu Lian, discussing matters regarding the Lotus Root Fortune, as well as many trivial matters. At the end of the letter, he informed Zhu Lian that he would be waiting in the Dragon Palace Cave for a reply from the Downtrodden Mountain before continuing his journey. He candidly mentioned in the letter that his half-hearted wandering around the Northern Ju Lu had indeed yielded some surplus, but if the Downtrodden Mountain could lend him some money without hidden dangers or long-term worries, he would not hastily sell his possessions. If there were any gaps, he would not hide them either; he would strive to act as a packrat once more in the Dragon Palace Cave and also let the Spring Dew Garden’s Ant’s Store clear the inventory, making whatever profits he could.

After putting down his pen, Chen Ping'an did not rush to have the young man named Li Yuan help send the letter to the Downtrodden Mountain.

After packing away the paper and letter, Chen Ping'an began to seriously consider a matter.

Should he refine a third fateful object in this Dragon Palace Cave?

He glanced at the sword immortal on the wall, contemplating that since he already possessed a celestial weapon, a debt of a few thousand grains of Gu Yu money was not excessive.

At the Bone Beach of Wooden Garb Mountain, Pang Lanxi had persuaded his grandfather to pick up the brush again and draw several sets of divine lady portraits worthy of presentation so that he could gift them, allowing him to travel across continents with his head held high.

At Ghostly Marsh, a little mouse spirit was still faithfully guarding the steps outside the Sheep Intestine Palace, lying in the sun with a wooden spear across its legs, keeping watch for its ancestor, but when the ancestor was away, it would sneak out books and read carefully.

In Jingguan City, Gao Cheng had recently been feeling somewhat restless, unsure where the flaw lay.

At Dumb Lake, the amiable little water monster had vanished, reportedly having traveled far with a young cultivator.

In the Golden Crow Palace, the highest-ranking Golden Core sword cultivator, Liu Zhiqing, still sat in silent meditation at the peak of his mountain, having sealed the mountain and entered closed-door cultivation. He coldly observed the myriad emotions of the sect’s disciples, watching their joys and sorrows, cleansing his sword with human sentiment.

In the Spring Dew Garden on Old Huai Street, that little shop employing a shopkeeper was making a modest living, but unfortunately, there were now fewer big spenders, which was somewhat disappointing.

The young assistant who carved seals from jade and crystal rocks had become increasingly skilled with his knife, earning a fair amount of honest money.

After arriving at the Tai Hui Sword Sect, Liu Jinglong was currently in closed-door cultivation, and it was said that two of the questioners had already been confirmed: Li Cai from Floating Weeds Sword Lake and Dong Zhu.

At Peach Blossom Ferry in the Fu Hu Kingdom, Liu Guibao was studying a book on the Dao but occasionally thought of a young scholar named Huai Qian from afar, feeling somewhat resentful for not having a keen eye, mixed with a tinge of sadness that lingered in his heart, hard to shake off, yet quietly returning.

In the Cloud City, Xu Xingji successfully broke through, entering the Sea Watching Realm, planning to visit the young sword immortal he admired, Liu Zhiqing, whenever Liu Zhiqing ascended to the upper five realms and managed to withstand the questioning from three sword immortals. He would bring enough good wine, for it was said that Liu Zhiqing loved to drink, but generally preferred not to, for this reason, Xu Xingji had been training his alcohol tolerance, which worried Shen Zhenze and Zhao Qingwan, fearing that Xu Xingji might become too indulgent. Xu Xingji had to explain that it was Chen Ping'an who had told him that if his drinking capacity was inadequate, he would have nothing to discuss with Liu Zhiqing, let alone enjoy a drink.

On a peak of a mountain at the Tai Hui Sword Sect, a white-haired boy, who had officially become a disciple of the sect, sat alone on a long bench, rocking back and forth, feeling utterly listless. He initially thought that surnamed Liu, being a renowned sword immortal, would at least have a grand celestial residence in the Tai Hui Sword Sect. However, he found only this little dilapidated hut behind him. There were plenty of books inside, but he didn’t love to read them. Therefore, with nothing to do, the white-haired boy wondered if he could deal with those talented youths of the Tai Hui Sword Sect if he were still an assassin from the Cutting Deer Mountain. Yet, those peers were all polite to him, and he felt that he truly couldn’t bring himself to strike them. Those fellows looked at him with envy, and he was puzzled, “Why do you all love being disciples of that Liu guy? Would it work if we swapped places?”

Unfortunately, when they heard this, their expressions turned strange, and they no longer came around the little hut, which made things quieter for him.

At the western coast of the Northern Ju Lu, near the Thunder God’s residence by Infant Mountain, a young and an old Taoist appeared.

The young Taoist crouched down, retching. This was the benefit of experience; after eating and drinking enough, he felt much better than dry heaving for half a day.

The old man crouched down, gently patting his disciple’s back, “It’s a pity my Taoist skills aren’t high.”

Zhang Shanfeng turned his head with a forlorn face, “Master, if you say that, it doesn’t make me feel any better.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “The master’s heart is indeed feeling better.”

Zhang Shanfeng took a deep breath, just about to get up, but he continued to crouch down and retch again.

Just as the Fire Dragon Real Man was about to complain about himself, a group of cultivators flying toward Infant Mountain passed overhead, seeing the young Taoist’s embarrassment, and they burst into laughter.

Zhang Shanfeng had no time to mind them, as he felt dizzy.

However, the old man vanished without a trace, appearing beside the two earth immortals, placing a hand on one of their heads, smiling, “What’s so funny? Tell me; let me have a laugh too.”

The two earth immortals felt their scalps tingle and immediately shrank their necks, looking like two frightened chicks. One bravely said, “We saw the old immortal, and we’re happy!”

The other, slower to react, hastily added, “Happy! We encountered the old immortal; we’re super happy today!”

The Fire Dragon Real Man gently pushed them, sending the two earth immortals stumbling forward in a hurry, laughing as they returned to Zhang Shanfeng's side.

After Zhang Shanfeng stood up and wiped the sweat from his forehead, he said, “Master, we can continue on our way now.”

The old man smiled, “No rush, take your time. For cultivators, time is slow and boundless; if you hurry, you might miss the scenery.”

Zhang Shanfeng complained, “I want to deliver the water pill to Chen Ping'an sooner.”

Sun Jie nodded, counting the numbers in his mind, recognizing that this matter could indeed be urgent.

In the ruins of the Golden Armor Continent, Liu Youzhou yawned. That white-clothed woman was still continuously punching, showing signs of being truly addicted. Cao Ci still did not strike back, remaining silent, merely observing the collapsed statues scattered around. Occasionally, she would face them, bow her head, clasp her hands together, or perform a bow.

The young woman, whose fist intent was rising increasingly high, simply kept punching. Liu Youzhou, not a pure martial artist, merely felt that she was becoming increasingly erratic, punching capriciously without any clear pattern.

However, it seemed there was no difference for Cao Ci; she continued to focus on her own statues, watching them quietly.

Suddenly, she halted, her hands and the back of her hands exposed, white bones visible, skin missing. She asked in a deep voice, “Am I still wrong?”

Cao Ci turned her head, smiling, “What? If you can’t defeat my punches, then is it wrong? Among the same generation, is there a correct fist technique?”

Cao Ci rarely spoke, but this time, she spoke two full sentences, “There’s no such thing as a wrong fist technique; only martial artists who practice incorrectly, and those who do not exert enough effort.”

The young woman gritted her teeth, “It’s not about ‘not able to defeat,’ but ‘not able to hit!’”

Cao Ci acknowledged with a sound.

And did not speak further.

Since that was the case, as long as it wasn’t blind, they could all see what was in front of them; it was clear in their hearts. For her, it was easy to offer a few polite words, but what benefit would it bring her?

If a pure martial artist, determined to reach the top, could not endure a few truths and facts, how could they climb the mountain of fist intent and ultimately stand firm at the peak?

This point had been well demonstrated by that peer she had met on the Sword Qi Great Wall years ago, who willingly accepted fate, ultimately striving for a day when he would reject fate.

Cao Ci continued forward, recalling something, and asked, “Do you remember how many punches you’ve thrown?”

The young woman shook her head, “I didn’t keep track of that.”

Facing away from her, Cao Ci slowly said, “Then from now on, only remember this: you don’t need to think about how to throw punches or the strength to release; just remember the number of punches.”

The young woman frowned, “Cao Ci, why are you willing to guide my fist technique?”

Cao Ci raised her head, looking at the sky, “It’s not guidance; it’s just that you are worthy of me saying a few more words. It’s nothing monumental. You may encounter other martial artists in the future, and I trust you will do the same. The path of martial arts isn’t a narrow path of life and death; the fortune of martial arts is… never mind, it seems a bit inappropriate to say to you.”

She smiled bitterly, “That’s because you’re Cao Ci. You’re destined not to encounter despair among your peers, so you can say this.”

Cao Ci nodded, “I don’t need to think about that.”

She felt a bit irritable.

Cao Ci said, “True martial artists are pure; they won’t let others feel like they are just a wrathful brute.”

Liu Youzhou clicked his tongue in wonder; it was rare for Cao Ci to chatter so much in one breath.

Perhaps this is what Cao Ci deemed “purity.”

After all, once this girl ascends to the Golden Body Realm as the strongest sixth realm, Cao Ci would gain a peer of equal standing, at least in terms of realm.

As for the heights of their respective fist techniques at that time.

Cao Ci was likely the most aware of it; she would still feel a sense of despair. To fight against a seventh realm with a sixth realm was already difficult; if it were a seventh realm against another seventh realm, and she still felt as lost as ever, Liu Youzhou would feel frustrated for her.

In a bustling street of a city in the Qing Ming world, a dashing young Taoist set up a stall, claiming to read palm lines, a family trade. Young women and girls flocked to him.

As for his little junior brother, after witnessing a tragic story about a cultivator’s vengeance, he chose to blend in, finding a peer who felt like a brother and a childhood sweetheart.

The young Taoist, while stroking the fair hand of a beautiful girl, spoke mystically and chanted incantations, while simultaneously pondering whether his little junior brother would spare the originally close friend, who had once been like a brother to him, and whether he would ask him to take that girl back to the White Jade Capital together. This was yet another not-so-cheerful little story, as the little junior brother had many choices, but ultimately, it all hinged on how he viewed the so-called heart toward the Dao.

Lu Chen gently placed the girl’s delicate hand down and spoke to her about matters of fate.

He turned his gaze to a certain point, neither disappointed nor surprised.

The little junior brother was embracing the corpse of a peer, quietly shedding tears, and the girl stood nearby, seemingly struck by lightning, appearing somewhat innocent and adorable in Lu Chen’s eyes.

But after killing one person, three hearts had died.

This business was hard to say whether it was a good deal or a loss.

Lu Chen supported his chin with one hand, observing the bustling street, smiling at a woman who had paused at a distance, glancing back at him.

The young woman likely hadn’t expected to be noticed by the handsome Daoist. She turned her slender waist, lowering her head shyly and walked away.

The smile of the woman was captivating, a sight to behold.

Lu Chen estimated that even if he looked at her for ten thousand years, he would still find her delightful.

Sighing, Lu Chen thought that the little junior brother was somewhat acceptable; killing others was akin to killing oneself, barely getting by, passing through one heart's barrier.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t mind giving him another slap to turn him into a puddle of mud.

But there was still quite a gap between this little junior brother and Lu Chen’s best expectations.

The human body is the universe; the Daoist cultivates the great Dao. How can the two great sayings of heaven and purity be so minor in meaning?

The more Lu Chen pondered, the less happy he felt, and he irritably plucked a bamboo stick from the sign tube, breaking it gently.

That little junior brother appeared as if he had been severed in two by a flying sword, not dead, merely half-dead.

After all, this little junior brother possessed three white jade treasures from the White Jade Capital; it wasn’t so easy to die.

Another Lu Chen appeared beside the little junior brother, who was struggling to piece himself together, crouching down and smiling, “Little junior brother, put in some effort to reassemble yourself; you’ll definitely survive.”

As for the Lu Chen at the fortune-telling stall, he was all smiles as he extended his hand to a young girl who had already taken a seat, “I’m proficient in palm reading, and my predictions on matters of fate are remarkably accurate; I’m practically the sworn brother of the Matchmaker.”

By the riverbank of the Southern Posa Continent, on a stone cliff, Liu Xianyang discovered for the first time that the old Confucian scholar had arrived earlier than he had.

After walking up the cliff, Liu Xianyang performed a bow and called out, “Old Sir.”

They often met, and the old man claimed to be a teacher. Due to the existence of a school in the Southern Posa family, many came here to study, and even more came to travel, so Liu Xianyang didn’t find it strange not to recognize the old man.

Today, however, Liu Xianyang noticed that the old man seemed somewhat different; he no longer frequently inquired about his academic progress or whether he had any doubts about the texts. The old man had once said that if one’s learning was shallow, they must not stick too strictly to the wording, and abandoning the text was not ideal. If one’s learning deepened, and one became attached to the text, merely guarding it was also not right; knowledge in the world must be pursued step by step.

Standing on the cliff, the old scholar gazed at the river, remaining silent for a long time before turning to ask, “Liu Xianyang, what do you think of the family and academic traditions of the Southern Posa family?”

Liu Xianyang was somewhat surprised; this was the old man’s first question since they had met. He didn’t know why the old man would ask this again.

Liu Xianyang still gave a similar answer, “Good.”

The old man asked, “What is good about it?”

Liu Xianyang smiled and said, “It’s good because it is useful.”

The old man nodded, “That’s truly not bad.”

Liu Xianyang quietly asked, “What were you thinking about earlier, Old Sir?”

The old man smiled, “As an old man, I often think about the affairs behind me.”

Liu Xianyang was left speechless.

The old man continued, “Young people shouldn’t be so gloomy; you should be full of vitality, willing to point out the wrongs in the world, question the flaws in the principles, and think about how to apply the knowledge learned from books to benefit the world.”

Liu Xianyang nodded, “I will strive to do so.”

The old man sighed, “Seeing you young people makes us old folks feel that time is always insufficient; it seems I haven’t done enough as a teacher.”

Liu Xianyang sighed.

The old man smiled, “Don’t sigh; good fortune might run away.”

Liu Xianyang paused, wondering if this was a thing to consider.

The old man burst into laughter, “When I was young, my elders used to scare me like this.”

Liu Xianyang found it quite amusing.

In his memory, Chen Ping'an never sighed. Yet he and the little snot-nosed kid often lay under the shade of trees in summer or on the fields at night, sighing back and forth in a playful manner. But it seemed that during those years, the one with the worst luck was always Chen Ping'an. He wondered if becoming the mountain lord of his hometown counted as a change in fortune.

On the tenth day of the tenth month, Chen Ping'an boarded the talisman boat prepared for Fushui Island, heading to the main city of the Dragon Palace Cave. The incense offerings were plentiful, and even the cultivators burned paper and crafted mourning clothes in accordance with ancient customs to send clothes to their ancestors. Chen Ping'an was no exception; he bought many multicolored paper clothes cut by the Water Dragon Sect, filling a large basket. After returning to Fushui Island, he wrote the names on each piece, and the shop also provided a simple little stove for burning the paper. 

On the following day, the eleventh of the tenth month, he burned the paper, as it was said that it was best not to perform this act on the ghost festival day itself but rather in the days before and after, ensuring that one did not disturb the ancestors while allowing one’s ancestors and various passing spirits to benefit the most.

Some customs here in the Water Dragon Sect felt familiar to Chen Ping'an, such as those during the grave offerings in his hometown. Aside from adding soil, it was remarkably similar, just like the practice of men bowing without crying and women crying without bowing.

On this day, he burned paper for a full hour.

It left even Li Yuan, the Water Spirit in the sea of clouds, slightly dazed, nearly unable to resist looking at the numerous names written on the colorful paper clothes.

Yet, recalling that she addressed him as “Mr. Chen,” Li Yuan did not dare to act carelessly.

On the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the Water Dragon Sect held a grand Golden Jade Ritual, preparing offerings and rites to alleviate misfortune and bless the deceased.

Compared to the expenses incurred during the previous ghost festival for multicolored paper clothes, sponsoring incense and lighting lamps at this Golden Jade Ritual would not come cheap.

Chen Ping'an actively activated the mountain-water formation of Fushui Island, and Li Yuan pretended to have just arrived.

Chen Ping'an inquired in detail about the regulations of the Golden Jade Ritual and eventually handed Li Yuan a thick booklet filled with densely packed names and origins, giving him two grains of Gu Yu money.

He asked him to participate in the Golden Jade Ritual, requesting the high-level cultivators of the Water Dragon Sect to write down those names on specially crafted talisman paper, to accumulate blessings for those deceased in the book.

Li Yuan could no longer contain himself and asked, “May I ask, Mr. Chen, are these deceased old friends?”

Chen Ping'an said, “It’s merely an attempt to make amends; it’s still far from enough. I only hope it’s still useful and that it’s not too late.”

Li Yuan held the booklet, nodding, “Rest assured; the heavens resonate with sincerity, and the spirits communicate through sincerity. Don’t underestimate your own earnestness.”

Thus, Li Yuan personally set about handling this matter.

Chen Ping'an went up to the roof, bringing the sword immortal with him, resting it across his knees, alone, gazing blankly in all directions.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 652: Too Bad It Rains Instead of Money (Part One)

Chen Ping'an had been staying on Fushui Island for almost ten days. During this time, he had asked Li Yuan to help with two tasks: first, to attend the Jinlu Daoist temple for resolving water-related calamities, and second, to send a letter to Luopo Mountain.

Chen Ping'an could not guess the identity of the person he had seen. The youth had a weary face, looking utterly exhausted, as if he had hit a bottleneck in his cultivation. Chen Ping'an had observed this same kind of decline in spirit and vitality in some old cultivators who had long since given up on their paths. Li Yuan, aside from being startled by the island's formation, would not dare to set foot on shore without permission. This only deepened Chen Ping'an's confusion about Li Liu's cultivation experiences in Beiju Luzhou over the years. Yet, none of the numerous reports from the mountains and rivers mentioned anything about it.

During these days, aside from diligently refining the spiritual energy of the mountains and rivers, stabilizing and expanding the key formations at the Shui Fu Shrine and the mountain altar, Chen Ping'an would meditate with intense focus, visualizing the sword energy surging like iron cavalry pounding on gates. He would also practice his sword techniques, sharpening the Dragon-slaying Platform during the new and full moons, sending sparks flying like a blacksmith crafting swords, filling the room with brilliant light.

The Dragon Palace's cave paradise experienced spring-like weather all year round, with winters that were not too cold and summers that lacked excessive heat. It often rained, ranging from gentle drizzles to torrential downpours. Whenever it rained, Chen Ping'an noticed that nearby islands would have cultivators—mostly earth immortals—bathing in the sweet rain, expanding their personal realms and absorbing the misty spiritual energy with open doors. Some would even summon treasures akin to jade pots or inkstones to collect rainwater, ensuring not a drop touched the island's ground.

In his leisure time, he began to peruse a story collection about the inevitability of death, where the paths taken were varied, and the fates were bizarre. Most stories featured characters with different temperaments, each meeting their end in peculiar ways, and the identities of their killers were diverse.

This collection had fallen to the ground after a great demon’s demise on the peak of a celestial ruin, later gifted to Chen Ping'an by Daoist Sun.

On Fushui Island, Chen Ping'an discovered a bamboo-handled oil paper umbrella. Whenever it rained, day or night, he would take a walk around the island, covering roughly thirty miles of scenic trails, all while holding the umbrella.

He had already taken down Li Liu's jade plaque inscribed with "Three Feet of Sweet Rain," placing it within arm's reach. Li Yuan's plaque, used to control the mountain and water formations, and the Water Dragon Sect's resting plaque, remained hanging by his waist. When he walked in the rain, the slightest shift in his steps would produce subtle clinking sounds.

One rainy night, Chen Ping'an once again took his umbrella and stepped outside, counting the time; Zhu Lian's reply should be arriving soon.

He paused, gazing towards the distance between the white-armored and gray-bearded islands, when suddenly a magnificent carriage leaped from the lake's surface. The carriage was as large as a loft, with eaves that resembled flying roofs, adorned with bells. Four snow-white steeds charged through the water, the bells jingling in harmony with the rain, creating a celestial melody. Following the carriage were clusters of beautifully dressed maidens and officials in red and purple robes, moving gracefully across the water.

On the carriage, there was no coachman to guide the steeds; instead, stood the young Li Yuan alongside a tall, graceful woman with hair styled like white jade buds. She wore a finely woven, short-sleeved robe, draped in light gauze that floated like mist.

Li Yuan had changed into a round-collared yellow robe, a white jade belt cinched around his waist, and black boots on his feet.

As this procession appeared, Chen Ping'an sensed an anomaly on the white-armored and gray-bearded islands. Surrounding fog enveloped the area, obscuring their outlines. He was unsure whether the island's cultivators had activated protective formations or if someone from the carriage was manipulating water techniques to prevent the island's cultivators from spying on the scene.

The carriage approached Chen Ping'an but did not land directly. It stopped about a mile outside Fushui Island, where only Li Yuan and the woman disembarked, walking towards the island.

The woman seemed to have temporarily lifted an illusion, revealing her previously indistinct features, unmistakably a local water deity with golden eyes.

Li Yuan and the woman walked up to Chen Ping'an, and Li Yuan smiled, introducing her: "This is Madam Shen, the lady of the Nanxun Water Palace, responsible for the winds and rains of the Dragon Palace cave paradise. You can address her as Madam Shen."

Despite the heavy rain, Chen Ping'an quickly folded his oil paper umbrella and greeted her, "Madam Shen."

The water deity, Shen Lin, performed a gracious bow. "I am Shen Lin, an old acquaintance of the South Xun Palace, and I greet you, Young Master Chen."

Once she straightened up, she gently swept her sleeves, causing the rain above Fushui Island to cease.

Chen Ping'an was accustomed to speaking directly to others, but he inadvertently caught a glimpse of the water deity's true appearance. Her complexion resembled blue porcelain, and her "porcelain face" was covered with numerous fine cracks, creating a rather eerie impression upon closer inspection. Chen Ping'an understood the situation and did not pretend not to notice, tucking the oil paper umbrella under his arm and cupping his fists in apology to the water deity.

Shen Lin seemed a bit surprised and chuckled, "Young Master Chen need not be so formal; if my appearance frightens you, that would be a greater offense."

Li Yuan burst into laughter, finding her words amusing.

However, Chen Ping'an did not smile, causing Li Yuan to reluctantly suppress his grin, realizing it was not the time for levity. If the old masters of the Water Dragon Sect were still alive, they would surely be laughing heartily at the scene.

Chen Ping'an held the oil paper umbrella in one hand and extended the other.

Shen Lin glanced at Li Yuan, who quickly gestured for her to follow suit. Only then did she walk alongside Chen Ping'an, while Li Yuan leisurely trailed behind, arms crossed behind his head.

The Nanxun Water Palace was the foremost among the many water deities of the Dragon Palace cave paradise. As for the mountain deities, they were even less significant. Within this small cave paradise, the ones with the least status were those mountain deities seemingly confined by the surrounding waters. Some noble spirits of the Great Lyu Dynasty, waiting for the Lu family court to bestow titles, or famous ministers and heroes from small nations whose souls had not scattered after death, would jump at the chance to be thrown into the Dragon Palace cave paradise and be recognized as deities, even if it meant facing death again. Their motivations were not only selfish; they feared being restricted in this small paradise and lamented that the fragrance of mountains could never compare to that of water. More importantly, once entering this small realm, they would be away from their homelands, and as deities, how could they repay their country's spiritual energy? Thus, any noble spirit viewed serving as a mountain deity in a small paradise as a form of demotion or exile, preferring to be a minor city god than a deity of a cave paradise.

Shen Lin referring to herself as an old acquaintance of the Nanxun Palace was quite a noteworthy statement, for the Dragon Palace cave paradise spanned eight thousand miles and had over a thousand islands. Its waterway was the richest in the region, with a total of thirty-two water deities, including the Lord of the Water God Lake and the River Gods, alongside the twelve major islands that housed mountain deities, city gods, and both civil and military temples, far outnumbering the water deities.

Li Yuan looked at the "woman" ahead, feeling a deep sense of sympathy.

They were kindred spirits. 

However, the Water Dragon Sect could only do so much, relying on the annual Jinlu Daoist temple to increase its incense offerings. While they could provide some assistance to the Nanxun Palace, akin to repairing buildings in a marketplace, it was still not as effective as Shen Lin, who naturally absorbed offerings and refined their essence. In the end, this was the fundamental difference between a cave paradise and a blessed ground. A cave paradise was suitable for cultivators who wished to meditate in peace, while a blessed ground was expansive and populous, conducive to the gathering of incense from the masses, making it a true celestial temple for deities.

Chen Ping'an enjoyed pleasant conversation with Madam Shen.

Unfortunately, the Dragon Palace cave paradise was not like the celestial peaks of Chunlu and Caique, which had compiled collections of local customs for people to learn about. In fact, it was Chen Ping'an's first time hearing about the Nanxun Water Palace.

However, deities with the title of "water palace" often had significant backgrounds. 

At Shujian Lake, the island owner Liu Chongrun, a princess of a fallen nation, had a legendary water palace in her homeland, which attracted the attention of the Zhu Ying Dynasty's sword cultivators. Of course, that young sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying imperial family was also eyeing both wealth and beauty. Chen Ping'an had witnessed the marvels of the treasures stored in the water palace, which even earth immortals coveted. According to Liu Chongrun, the most coveted water elixirs could stir up waves a hundred feet high in Shujian Lake with just a single pill.

Before Chen Ping'an left Luopo Mountain, Liu Chongrun had yet to finalize the relocation details with Zhu Lian. Chen Ping'an did not quite understand why Liu Chongrun insisted on splitting the female cultivators of Zhu Chai Island in two. While leaving the ancestral hall at Shujian Lake, most of the disciples would be sent to Longquan County for cultivation. Now that Shujian Lake had its rules, and with Jiang Shangzhen stationed there, it was a world apart from the lawless days of Shujian Lake. To put it bluntly, Liu Chongrun's meager possessions would not entice the True Realm Sect.

Once relocated to Longquan County, she would still be living under someone else's roof. Chen Ping'an would collect the spirit offerings from Zhu Chai Island without losing a single coin. Since Zhu Chai Island had mobilized, Liu Chongrun had expended considerable effort, and Chen Ping'an could not fathom her reasoning.

Just as Chen Ping'an could not comprehend the relationship between Li Liu and Li Yuan, nor understand the connection between Shen Lin and Li Yuan. Thus, this journey consisted mainly of polite small talk with the Nanxun Water Palace deity.

Having become accustomed to this from his time at Shujian Lake, Chen Ping'an was adept at handling these interactions with utmost politeness, ensuring he did not come off as distant or cold. For instance, he would humbly inquire about the origins of the Princess Ascension Monument on Fushui Island, and Shen Lin, as one of the oldest deities in the Dragon Palace cave paradise alongside Li Yuan, would share her knowledge freely.

Li Yuan observed the two old acquaintances chatting animatedly ahead, finding it somewhat amusing.

Yet, amidst the amusement, he felt a tinge of sadness.

That lofty leader of the martial world, after countless years, finally visited this summer retreat of the Dragon Palace cave paradise, only to neglect even a glance at the Nanxun Water Palace. He could not even spare a word for Shen Lin, who had worked hard without any credit.

Li Yuan was certain that if it were not for this "Mr. Chen" gracing them with his presence, that leader would not even have cast a glance at the water deity who had dutifully guarded this summer palace for many years.

What a heartless situation.

Li Yuan felt that both he and Shen Lin were deities of considerable rank and status, sufficiently detached from worldly affairs. Yet, compared to that ancient and unreachable divine figure, they seemed like foolish mortals.

Shen Lin appeared to be in high spirits, actively introducing the customs of the Dragon Palace cave paradise to Young Master Chen.

This was precisely what Chen Ping'an wanted to hear.

Since his first journey with the Little Treasure Bottle and the others, this had always been the case.

He would ask woodcutters when climbing mountains, fishermen when wading through rivers, and inquire with local folk when entering towns and cities. Even when his most diligent disciple, Li Baoping, wanted to help alleviate his burdens, Chen Ping'an was still not at ease.

Afterward, even during his solitary travels, he continued this pattern.

Any unfamiliar land that Chen Ping'an felt he could not fully grasp left him restless.

This was likely deeply connected to the series of events he had encountered: the ghost bride blocking his path, the upheaval at Flying Eagle Fortress, his inadvertent entry into the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, and the lurking dangers of Ghostly Valley, among others.

Chen Ping'an recognized that if he allowed his mindset to become extreme in this regard without making any changes, it would become a significant obstacle on his path to cultivation.

This thought had only recently dawned on him after meeting Li Liu.

Reflecting on Li Liu's demeanor and actions here, Chen Ping'an realized that even when he returned to his hometown, aside from sitting alone in the ancestral home at Mud Bottle Alley, where he could at least refrain from overthinking, he had become accustomed to immersing himself in a state of obsessive certainty, feeling he knew everything down to the smallest details.

Thus, he envied those two celestial skills—shrinking distances to mere inches and the ability to command mountains and rivers.

Especially when Li Liu casually remarked, "If your mindset is unstable, no matter how far you travel, you’ll just be walking in circles," it struck Chen Ping'an like a clarion call.

Chen Ping'an could confidently assert he had always known what he wanted, where he wanted to go, and what kind of person he aspired to be.

Yet, on this journey, he had stumbled and faltered, realizing it had not all been due to the capriciousness of fate; he, Chen Ping'an, had also invited many "blessings and woes" upon himself.

And so, he found himself sitting on the roof that day, feeling the vastness of the world, unsure of how to take the next step.

A ten-year vow to become a Golden Body martial artist and return to the Upside-Down Mountain.

To rebuild a bridge to longevity and successfully refine five of his life’s treasures.

To become the true swordsman he envisioned in his heart, striving to also become a great sword immortal with boundless freedom.

But human strength is limited, and so is willpower.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an had countless thoughts swirling through his mind, weighing intricate matters beyond just these three major goals. It was not merely a simple matter of owing a few thousand Rain Money coins.

The things he had to do, were they not more than just his personal affairs?

A tangled mess, with matters of all sizes.

How should he prioritize them? Each day, how should he allocate his thoughts, energy, and time to his own principles, translating them into concrete actions?

Chen Ping'an subconsciously came to a halt.

Madam Shen, the water deity, also halted discreetly.

Li Yuan, having done nothing behind them, meticulously counted the number of tiny pearls embedded in Shen Lin's light gauze robe, which weighed no more than three or four taels. He had already counted over nine thousand.

Shen Lin’s visit was not something Li Yuan had initiated; rather, it was triggered by the earlier fleeting appearance of that leader from the martial world, which had stirred a faint sense of connection in Shen Lin. However, she dared not make her presence known directly and instead waited until that connection faded completely before cautiously seeking out Li Yuan, without daring to ask directly. Li Yuan found this tedious; after all, pretending to be foolish in such significant matters, even with his sympathy for the water deity, he did not dare to reveal too much.

But it was hard to refuse Shen Lin, so he had no choice but to compromise and take her on a tour of Fushui Island, as it was her duty as the head deity of a small paradise to patrol the waters.

Unfortunately, that "Mr. Chen," who had been referred to as "Young Master Chen," did not have the "Three Feet of Sweet Rain" jade plaque hanging at his waist. The young man, though not very old, was exceptionally wise and cautious in his words, leading Li Yuan to estimate that Shen Lin would likely return empty-handed.

As the head deity of the Nanxun Water Palace, Shen Lin’s title did not hold true legitimacy, as no dynasty could interfere with the decrees of her deities, and even the heads of the academy seldom meddled. For instance, the recently appointed sage of the academy, Zhou Mi, had sent a gentleman to the Water Dragon Sect’s ancestral hall with ten sealed scrolls concerning the various deities of the Nanxun Water Palace, leaving only the names blank for the sect leader, Sun, to fill in with those from the Nanxun Water Palace. The meaning was simple: let this already bloated "little court" deal with its own affairs; Zhou Mi had come to Beiju Luzhou to pursue knowledge and could hardly be bothered with such trivial matters.

Shen Lin quickly reciprocated, keeping a few key deities intact while abolishing many ceremonial positions based on ancient rites. In the end, according to the positions listed on Zhou Mi's decree, the Nanxun Water Palace, which originally had over twenty water deities, retained only ten recognized by Confucian standards.

In the beginning, Shao Jingzhi, the leader of the southern sect who had a close relationship with the Nanxun Water Palace, had privately advised Shen Lin against such measures, arguing that she would lose over ten deities unnecessarily. After all, the academy's sage, Zhou Mi, had made it clear he would not involve himself in the operations of the Nanxun Water Palace, so why bother?

However, after Zhou Mi later intervened and left the academy, defeating several arrogant cultivators, Shao Jingzhi had to visit the Nanxun Water Palace again and admit he had nearly caused Shen Lin's downfall.

Noticing the young man beside her lost in thought, Shen Lin did not regard it as disrespectful; for a cultivator to have such a relaxed mindset could even be seen as an implicit trust.

Chen Ping'an soon collected his scattered thoughts and apologized, "Madam Shen, I’m sorry; I was lost in thought for a moment."

Shen Lin smiled and shook her head.

However, she had already shown signs of wanting to leave, so she invited the young man to visit the Nanxun Water Palace whenever he had the time.

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement but felt a bit helpless. Li Liu had mentioned she wanted to visit the main city before returning to Fushui Island, but it seemed she might have directly left the Dragon Palace cave paradise and the Water Dragon Sect.

When he inquired of Li Yuan, he simply replied that he did not know.

Shen Lin bid farewell and walked towards the shore, where the mist rose around her feet. In an instant, she returned to the carriage, turned the horse's head, and sped away. After a few miles, it seemed she vanished into the lake beneath the surface, along with the maidens and officials.

Li Yuan slowly withdrew his gaze, feeling a sense of regret.

If only this young man were a bit more clever, or perhaps a bit less so, Madam Shen would have invited him to visit the Nanxun Water Palace with more than just pleasantries. It would have been a gift that he could never refuse, a proper offering that could only be understood as a tribute to the owner of the "Three Feet of Sweet Rain" jade plaque. If "Young Master Chen" were willing to accept, Shen Lin would not only be grateful for his acceptance but would also feel compelled to offer even more. As long as he showed any hint of wanting it, even if the Nanxun Water Palace had to dismantle half of its treasures, she would certainly have more gifts to bestow.

Unfortunately, "Mr. Chen" quietly missed out on this stroke of fortune.

Is there anyone in this world who despises the riches of celestial treasures? Just like the water deities, who would disdain a few extra pounds or taels of incense essence?

Probably not.

What was even more regrettable was that Li Yuan could not remind him of anything. Otherwise, he would risk complicating the matter, ultimately harming Shen Lin, whose golden body was already crumbling, and putting himself, a mere minor water deity, in a difficult position.

Chen Ping'an watched as the carriage disappeared into the distance, standing beside the young man in the yellow robe and jade belt. He quietly took note of the fleeting complexity in Li Yuan's expression.

Li Yuan took out a sealed letter and said, "Mr. Chen, this is your hometown's reply. From the moment it was sent to its arrival, the Water Dragon Sect will have no way of detecting it."

In truth, the letter felt somewhat weighty.

This was the consequence of the separation of mountains and waters.

The letter was protected by a cleverly crafted mountain deity's prohibition.

As the Great Lu Water Deity, holding this letter made Chen Ping'an feel a bit "scorched."

He took the letter, noticing the four large characters on the envelope, and a smile crept onto his face.

The four characters read "For Master’s Eyes Only."

It was clearly the handwriting of his first disciple, the strokes neat and evidently written with care.

Chen Ping'an tucked the letter into his sleeve.

Li Yuan was about to take his leave, as that person had mentioned that Mr. Chen was here for secluded cultivation and must not be disturbed.

Once the water deity of the Nanxun Palace departed, the rain over Fushui Island quickly resumed.

Chen Ping'an raised his umbrella. Li Yuan smiled and said, "Mr. Chen, don’t mind me."

Chen Ping'an hesitated, quickly dismissing the urge to ask questions.

Did he really need to know the general standing of Madam Shen in the Dragon Palace cave paradise? What significance did that hold? Was it really necessary to pull on a thread that could unravel a whole tapestry?

It seemed unnecessary.

The aging features on Li Yuan's face, the crumbling edge of Shen Lin's golden body, and Chen Ping'an's arrival here, meant he had pulled on a few threads buried deep beneath the water. Knowing the truth, if it aligned or conflicted with his own principles, did that mean he should intervene?

In many external matters, whether or not to know, he found himself seeking trouble instead. Wasn’t this the other extreme of a cultivator who completely disregarded worldly affairs?

Chen Ping'an felt that as long as he could clarify this fundamental thread, it would amount to a significant practice of the heart for him.

Thinking of this made Chen Ping'an envious of those who had unwavering "hearts for inquiry" from the start.

For instance, Lin Shouyi, who immediately resonated with the book "Above the Clouds," and the decisive young woman, Zhu Lu.

There were many such individuals he had encountered.

In terms of cultivating the heart, they were all direct and efficient, adept at simplifying complex matters.

Li Yuan asked, "Mr. Chen, do you seem to have some worries?"

This was a redundant question.

A cultivator free of doubts and worries would never be so idle as to step out into the rain with an umbrella, stopping intermittently, appearing restless, and occasionally jotting down notes or sketches in the dirt with a walking stick.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "I’m just a bit anxious waiting for my hometown's reply; it’s nothing significant."

Li Yuan didn’t press further.

After parting ways with Li Yuan, Chen Ping'an returned to his dwelling, leaning his oil paper umbrella against the door. The heavy rain had not yet stopped.

After gently shaking off the rainwater from his clothes, he settled down in the room.

He believed Zhu Lian would reply in detail about the recent happenings at Luopo Mountain and the situations surrounding Longquan County. 

Of course, the priority would be to elevate the Lotus Flower Blessed Land from a lowly status to a mid-tier one.

In truth, as soon as he received this reply, Chen Ping'an already knew one monumental piece of good news.

Wei Ban had broken through.

Otherwise, the letter would not have the mountain deity's prohibition unique to Piyun Mountain.

Chen Ping'an did not open the letter immediately. Instead, he got up, left the house, and stood under the eaves, gazing at the rain curtain.

When it rains on earth, one either seeks shelter at home or carries an umbrella when away. Otherwise, one can only get wet.

Chen Ping'an turned to look at the oil paper umbrella leaning against the wall.

Perhaps it was true that the umbrella need not be taken out when the sun was shining.

But when it rains, it should be used.

However, in town, who could predict when it would rain? Carrying an umbrella everywhere becomes a troublesome choice. Having it with him would add to the burden, and on sunny days, holding it in hand for others to see would be even less agreeable.

For those traveling in the mountains, there was no need for an umbrella in the rain.

Chen Ping'an scratched his head, feeling a bit troubled.

After much contemplation, he turned back toward the last thought in his mind: if only this heavy rain could bring down some Rain Money coins; if not, even snowflake coins would suffice.

---

Li Yuan had just headed to the sea of clouds when the water deity Shen Lin arrived.

As long as they were careful to hide their movements within the Dragon Palace cave paradise, even the two Yu-Pu realm cultivators guarding this area would not find any clues.

The two jade-pool realm cultivators of the Water Dragon Sect had not chosen to remain stationed at the sect's core.

This was a silent respect toward Water Deity Li Yuan and Water Deity Shen Lin.

Sect leader Sun would only attend the highest-level Jinlu Daoist temple ceremonies, never entering for the other jade and yellow Daoist temples.

Compared to the northern sect, the southern sect led by Shao Jingzhi had a better relationship with the Nanxun Water Palace, visiting Shen Lin every few years.

Shen Lin's expression was complicated. "Li Yuan, can't you say something casual?"

Li Yuan merely smiled, remaining silent.

Even if the answer was a simple "cannot," it would be enough for Shen Lin to guess the correct direction.

But Li Yuan said nothing, even referring to Mr. Chen merely as one of two old friends' disciples, leaving Shen Lin unable to discern the truth.

As long as there was uncertainty, any unnecessary actions taken by the old acquaintance of the Nanxun Water Palace would be gambling with her life.

Shen Lin changed her approach and tentatively asked, "Shall I ask Shao Jingzhi?"

Li Yuan chuckled, "As you wish."

The golden light in Shen Lin's eyes shimmered, fixating on her fellow water deity.

Li Yuan remained unperturbed.

One was a Great Lu Water Deity, the other a serving deity of a summer palace.

Both held similar ranks, as if one were a servant managing incense offerings and the other a maid handling courtyard chores.

Neither could interfere with the other, nor were either indispensable figures.

If Shen Lin were to truly inquire with Shao Jingzhi, at best, it would be a trivial matter, and at worst, should he learn of Shen Lin's actions and take offense, it could result in a death sentence for her, who was already crumbling.

Li Yuan did not wish to assist Shao Jingzhi in this trial, for he too was like a mud bodhisattva crossing the river, struggling to save himself.

Having promised to take her to Fushui Island was already as much courage as Li Yuan could muster, doing his utmost.

Shen Lin forced a smile. "They say distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors. We have been neighbors for so long…"

Li Yuan's expression darkened, and he frowned. "As the lady of the Nanxun Water Palace, Shen Lin, I advise you to know when to stop!"

Shen Lin was taken aback and bowed in apology.

Li Yuan waved his sleeve and left.

Dejected, Shen Lin departed the sea of clouds and returned to the lake, using her water manipulation techniques to make her way home.

Upon reaching the grand water palace, as immense as a royal capital, she did not head straight towards her residence but had to pass through the large gate bearing the plaque "Favorable Winds and Rain," entering only through the side entrance.

That great door had never been opened, not even when the sect leader of the Water Dragon Sect visited, nor the rulers of the Great Lu Dynasty's Chongxuan Department, or even the sword immortal Li Cai from Floating Duck Lake. They all had to enter through the side door.

After passing through the side entrance, Shen Lin vanished in a flash, appearing beside her garden, filled with various exotic flowers and plants. The rare birds that flitted through the blossoms were long extinct in the wild.

A deity appeared to report, "Madam, Shao Jingzhi from the southern sect has come to visit. Should we meet?"

Shen Lin hesitated for a moment and shook her head. "Tell him I'm in closed-door cultivation and cannot receive guests."

At the same time that Shen Lin was rejecting Shao Jingzhi, Li Yuan had transformed his appearance, using a concealment technique to become an ordinary-looking young man in a yellow robe. He made his way down the white jade steps and began to descend the mountain, heading across the city gates toward a bridge-side tavern to drink.

Rather than going to the fifth floor, he chose a seat in the bustling first-floor hall, as it was livelier there. With the two ceremonies concluded, compared to the crowded scene when Chen Ping'an was drinking, where it was difficult to find a seat and required sharing tables, there were now plenty of open spots.

Li Yuan, moving freely between the Dragon Palace cave paradise and the Great Lu Bridge, found it quite convenient. Since the founding of the Water Dragon Sect, he had only slightly refined the shrine within Jidu, and aside from guarding the cave paradise, he had rarely traversed this long bridge, changing his appearance each time he returned.

After serving his duties for hundreds or even thousands of years, even if he had done so for ten thousand years, it would be considered part of his responsibilities. Yet, violating certain rules, even just once, could lead to an irreparable disaster for a deity like him.

Now that Shen Lin's golden body was on the verge of collapse, there were signs of her desire to break the rules to maintain her position, which Li Yuan could not bear to witness.

In truth, ever since he had seen that person in this life again, he had completely lost hope, and there was no longer any room for luck.

For he finally confirmed that whether it was Water Deity Li Yuan or Water Deity Shen Lin, they were both indifferent to the life or death of their golden bodies; that person simply did not care.

This was also why Li Yuan did not offer further reminders to Shen Lin. Since that person had ceased to care about the Dragon Palace cave paradise or the waters of Jidu, why would they mind if Shen Lin crossed the line?

If by chance Shen Lin were to succeed against the odds, would that imply Li Yuan could do the same, repairing his golden body and prolonging his life?

Li Yuan did not care for this wretched feeling.

Thus, he sought refuge in this bustling tavern, drowning his sorrows in drink.

Li Yuan had no idea what Mr. Chen was troubled about on Fushui Island, needing to repeatedly step out with an umbrella on rainy days. He felt that even if the Dragon Palace cave paradise were a rain of wine, drinking it all would not quench his worries.

Moreover, deities were never drunk, regardless of whether the wine was from the marketplace or celestial brews.

Li Yuan attempted to squeeze out a tear to feel pity for himself but found it impossible.

He began drinking the late-night wine, slamming his palms on the table, howling like a drunken youth.

Nearby, a drunken patron shouted, "You brat, shut up! You're driving me crazy!"

Li Yuan wiped his face and turned toward the man, feeling wronged. He gently caressed the table, "What's wrong with howling a bit when I'm in a bad mood?"

The man sneered, "You’re ruining my drinking mood! Are you asking for a beating?"

Li Yuan raised his hands and rubbed his cheeks.

He considered taking that fellow to Jidu and treating him to water instead of wine, all free of charge.

Just then, an old man and a young female cultivator descended from the upper floor. The latter bore the jade plaque of the Water Dragon Sect’s ancestral hall at her waist.

The old man looked at the man and smiled, “Quiet down, we don’t want to stir up trouble.”

The man angrily retorted, “Who do you think you are, old man?!”

The old man chuckled, “I’m just here to settle the bill. Today, I’ll cover the drinks for all the guests on the first floor, as a gesture of goodwill. Consider it a favor for my old friend Huan Yun.”

The man was momentarily stunned, then stood and cupped his fists, “Ah, it’s Elder Huan! My apologies!”

Huan Yun returned the gesture, descending the stairs and settling the bills for all the patrons, which led to applause throughout the hall.

Earlier, Li Yuan had caught a glimpse of the elder, recognizing him as an earth immortal nearing a breakthrough, accompanied by a young woman who had just entered the Golden Core stage. If he recalled correctly, her name was Bai Bi, who held considerable favor with Sect Leader Sun. This young lady was fortunate indeed, which explained Sun's efforts to nurture her. Sun was determined to bestow the coveted inch-gold talisman upon his direct disciple, even if it meant taking advantage of Bai Bi’s position in the sect—a suspicion of personal gain lingered.

Within the ancestral hall of the Water Dragon Sect, the northern and southern sects were often at odds, especially with Shao Jingzhi, who typically did not engage directly with Sun. Li Yuan had once hidden within an ancestral portrait, secretly watching the unfolding drama, finding it quite entertaining.

In truth, Sun was quite a capable leader.

He treated both northern and southern sects fairly.

Yet, this fairness had also become a source of discontent.

If Sun could simply favor the northern sect’s disciples, there would be far fewer grievances.

What if he were to finalize the heir to the Water Dragon Sect's leadership soon, resolutely continuing the tradition of favoring the north over the south? Would Shao Jingzhi and the southern sect be able to endure and ultimately have to bow in submission?

Being too accommodating and just was precisely why Sun struggled to command genuine loyalty.

Otherwise, among the offerings and guests in the ancestral hall, some of those who once sat in the southern sect’s row would have switched to the northern sect long ago.

Of course, if Sun could ascend to the realm of the immortals, all problems would vanish.

But regrettably, Sun lacked that aptitude and fortune.

At this moment, Li Yuan was lost in his drink.

Huan Yun and Bai Bi did not approach him to pester him, behaving quite appropriately.

After exiting the tavern, Bai Bi and Huan Yun walked to the end of the long bridge. Bai Bi smiled softly, “Elder, though I have entered the Golden Core stage, my time is limited, and my aptitude shallow. I have yet to establish a separate residence. I hope that next time you visit our sect, I will have secured an island in the Dragon Palace cave paradise, and I will be sure to host you well.”

Huan Yun chuckled, “As long as you confirm you can set up residence on that island, feel free to send a letter. I’ll come personally to congratulate you.”

Bai Bi smiled and nodded, bowing to the elder. “Thank you for your kindness.”

Huan Yun felt a bit reflective, returning the gesture. “Cultivation is not easy; let us encourage each other.”

Becoming a Golden Core cultivator marked them as equals.

As long as Huan Yun was not an infant in the realm of Nascent Soul, regardless of the age gap, he was indeed a peer to this young disciple of the Water Dragon Sect.

Bai Bi did not overly fawn on him, merely watching the elder head down the bridge, departing.

Yet, the gratitude this young Golden Core earth immortal felt came from the heart.

After returning to the Water Dragon Sect, she regretted not discussing the conclusion of matters with Huan Yun earlier. Even if it required her to offer a substantial gift, Bai Bi would have done so without hesitation. This way, the southern sect would not take advantage of the opportunity to undermine her prospects within the Water Dragon Sect, nor would it implicate her master.

For example, the martial artist from the wilds, who was a servant of the Water Dragon Sect, was actually more of a servant of the northern sect, nearly causing the ancestral hall’s chair to shift to the opposite side because of this incident. Her master had been quite irate.

Fortunately, there was light after the darkness.

Bai Bi never expected that under the condition of no transaction, Huan Yun would be willing to speak up for her, not only providing assistance in clearing her name within the sect but also enhancing her reputation. During her experience in the ruins, she had become a cautious and mature individual, knowing what to say and what to withhold. 

So when she heard about Huan Yun’s involvement after he became a recognized offering in Yunzhi City, her master had to remind the inexperienced Bai Bi that if she had the chance, she could subtly return to the Fuhua Kingdom and then "conveniently" visit Yunzhi City, considering that the city lord, Shen Zhenze, was also a Golden Core earth immortal.

Bai Bi noted everything.

Thus, this time, she sincerely invited Huan Yun, who was traveling through the northern Pavilion Kingdom, to visit the Water Dragon Sect.

When Huan Yun learned that she had not yet opened a residence on the island, he became even more considerate, claiming that he had been away for too long and needed to return to the mountain.

Thus, their conversation on the bridge unfolded.

All of these were life skills and social abilities that neither her master nor the teachings could impart or emphasize.

Bai Bi stood on the bridge, deep in thought.

She had previously been obsessed with that saying from the mountain: "If one cannot let go of worldly matters, one cannot become a person of the mountain."

Now it seemed that in mountain cultivation, there were so many cultivators all around her, high and low, scattered across every corner of the mountain. Perhaps the so-called letting go was not about being indifferent or self-serving.

Li Yuan leaned against the bridge railing, still over a hundred miles from the bridge's end, yet he could clearly see the figure of the young Golden Core female cultivator, feeling that her aptitude was quite good.

Suddenly, he heard someone behind him shout, "Hey, you brat!"

Li Yuan turned to see a man smiling as he tossed a wine jug over. "This jug of late-night wine was bought with my own money. From now on, don’t scream like a banshee in the tavern, you big guy. Aren’t you embarrassed?"

Li Yuan beamed as he caught the jug, bending slightly and calling out, "Thank you, sir! You take care!"

The man was momentarily stunned, then cursed a few times before striding away.

Li Yuan walked while sipping wine, feeling his mood lighten a little.

Huan Yun did not use a ferry or ride the wind, but rather strolled along the broad waters of Jidu.

Once, he had walked with a young man along the heart path.

That person had spoken some seemingly empty truths.

He said that some wisdom flowed like water, gradually circulating and helping people find their way, allowing them to walk steadily.

He also said that some wisdom was rooted in the mountains, with the ever-changing world, yet one’s heart remained as steady as a rock.

Both forms of wisdom were valuable, but the challenge lay in the constant conflicts between the two, resulting in bruises and bloodshed, sometimes even leading to self-inflicted harm.

Huan Yun could understand this because he himself had suffered greatly during a tumultuous expedition in search of treasure.

Whether Huan Yun was a good person was undeniable, as it was widely acknowledged by others, and he himself considered himself to be quite good.

Otherwise, he would not have traversed Yunzhi City to cheer on Shen Zhenze, who had no hope of becoming a Nascent Soul, and ultimately even promised to protect Xu Xingji and Zhao Qingyan.

Would a good person make mistakes? Certainly, especially when a precious treasure lay before him, risking his lifelong reputation, Huan Yun had indeed strayed from his conscience and true self, nearly leading him to commit heinous acts for the sake of reputation.

Often, it seemed that just a breath's difference could create an enormous divide between right and wrong, good and evil.

Under the night sky, with the moon shining brightly, Huan Yun took a deep breath, feeling refreshed.

He wondered if that young sword immortal, so open-minded, also harbored insurmountable heartaches.

If so, would that not be a chasm too wide to cross?

Huan Yun could only hope that person could build bridges over the waters and pave roads in the mountains, facing all storms without worry.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 653: Too Bad It Rains but Not Money (Part Two)

In a secluded area near the Water Dragon Sect (Shuilong Zong), an old Daoist priest extended his hand to support a young Daoist beside him.

The young Daoist, with a sword strapped to his back, swayed unsteadily, but his face was full of joy as he exclaimed, “Master, why do I feel like I’m not nauseous at all today?”

The old priest replied with a serious expression, “It must be because your cultivation has improved. When we return to Prone Peak (Pali Feng), your senior brothers will definitely praise you well.”

The young Daoist looked skeptical. “Master, be honest with me.”

Only then did the old priest say, “As your master, I have a wide circle of friends. Although we’ve been traveling quickly, it’s still unavoidable to take breaks. This is the closest we’ve come to our destination this time.”

The young Daoist complained, “Master, you really don’t know how to speak. No wonder your friends on the mountain are never eager to invite you up for a visit. I can see it clearly; they are all overly polite when chatting with you. Master, if you continue like this when you go down the mountain, it really won’t do.”

Realizing this, the Fire Dragon True Man nodded. “I’m not very skilled at making friends.”

Zhang Shan Feng glanced at his master but said nothing.

The old priest had to nod again. “In matters of cultivation, it’s not easy to find common ground either.”

Zhang Shan Feng chuckled. “It’s alright, Master. If your Daoist skills aren’t high, neither are mine.”

Zhang Shan Feng shook his head and looked around before continuing, “Master, with such a large sect as the Water Dragon Sect, you must have no friends here, right?”

The name of the Water Dragon Sect was clearly mentioned by his master since it was their destination. Master had said that his friend Chen Ping An was likely nearby. As for the other high mountains and lakes where the two had stopped, Zhang Shan Feng didn’t recognize them anyway.

The Fire Dragon True Man paused for a moment and then smiled and nodded.

He then conveyed silently to the sect master, Sun Jie, that there was no need for him to make an appearance and that he could return to the Ancestor Hall.

Not observing proper etiquette? 

Isn’t it enough for me to be standing here?

Chen Ping An entered the room and began to read through a confidential letter.

Zhu Lian first mentioned in the letter that Wei Bo had broken through, becoming the first mountain deity of the Fifth Level in the history of the Baoping Continent (Baoping Zhou).

The emperor of the Great Li Dynasty (Da Li), Song He, personally visited Longquan County. Just the six ministers who came included the Ministers of Rites and Justice, who ascended Cloud-Splitting Mountain to congratulate Wei Bo. Not only that, but the Great Li court also presented a treasured half-immortal weapon from the imperial treasury, named “Water Affinity,” as a gift to Cloud-Splitting Mountain, serving as an additional boon. With this, even a mountain deity would find it easier to control the waterways of his jurisdiction and could even suppress all the highest-ranking river deities in the Northern Great Li territory with ease. This shows that the new emperor, Song He, not only treated Wei Bo, a former minister of the last dynasty, with respect, but actively delegated power to Cloud-Splitting Mountain. Wei Bo, practically on his own, now shared control over the waters and mountains of the Great Li’s Song family’s territory with the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of Justice.

Thus, Zhu Lian urged Chen Ping An, the mountain lord, not to worry about selling off their assets. When Wei Bo broke through, his momentum was tremendous, and auspicious signs appeared everywhere. It was said that the entire populace of the Great Li capital was stirred up, with many wealthy families flocking to the newly opened Longzhou, eager to pay their respects at Cloud-Splitting Mountain to honor the Great Mountain Deity Wei. Furthermore, the Ministry of Revenue even gifted Cloud-Splitting Mountain nearly a hundred gold coins as part of the court's presents. Other ministries also showed their sincerity. Of course, all of this was done only after the young emperor gave his approval, allowing them to present gifts to Cloud-Splitting Mountain in broad daylight.

The young emperor was evidently somewhat surprised himself. Initially, he had overestimated the various ripples caused by Wei Bo’s breakthrough, but he hadn’t realized he had still underestimated the joyous atmosphere shared by the court and the people—a rare nationwide celebration since the establishment of the Great Li Dynasty. The last time was when the Great Li’s Prince Song Changjing achieved national merit by overthrowing the Lu Dynasty, which had long been a burden to the Great Li. Only then did the capital witness such a grand event where the people filled the streets. Looking back further, it was almost several hundred years ago, marking the Great Li’s complete liberation from the Lu Dynasty’s status as a vassal state, finally able to stand as a dynasty in its own right.

Zhu Lian mentioned that just the third Divine Night Celebratory Feast hosted by Wei Bo could conservatively fill half the deficit in the Grain Rain Fund.

Additionally, Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island had signed a water-and-land contract, choosing to settle in the abundant water transport area of the Crawfish Back. The Ancestor Hall remained at the Book Letter Lake and had not been relocated to avoid any petty grievances from the True Realm Sect. However, around a dozen of the most talented direct disciples would cultivate at Crawfish Back. Currently, Liu Chongrun had begun hiring Mo family craftsmen and mechanics to construct a residence at Crawfish Back. According to the agreement, these buildings, along with the mountain itself, would automatically become the personal property of mountain lord Chen Ping An unless the contract was renewed after three hundred years.

However, the lease of Crawfish Back by Zhu Chai Island was only secured with a down payment of thirty Grain Rain coins. Liu Chongrun firmly asserted that her family’s business was too small and lacked savings. Considering the moving expenses and managing various connections, paying out thirty Grain Rain coins had nearly left her penniless.

As a result, Zheng Dafeng’s joking comments led Liu Chongrun to reveal a significant secret related to her worldly identity, marking a rather unexpected delight.

This fallen country’s princess was willing to secretly assist the Ruined Mountain in recovering the Water Palace and a sunken dragon boat, both of which had never been acquired by the Zhu Ying Dynasty. If both items could be retrieved, Liu Chongrun could offer up the immensely valuable dragon boat as a ferry. If only one item could be reclaimed, be it the dragon boat or the Water Palace, the division between Crawfish Back and Ruined Mountain would be fifty-fifty.

Zhu Lian did not immediately agree, as this would involve the local Great Li cavalry and could easily trigger disputes. Thus, he inquired in the letter whether Chen Ping An thought this could be pursued.

As for the new magistrate Wei Li, who came from the vassal Huangting Kingdom, and the newly appointed city god from the confluence of the Three Rivers, these unexpected developments in the Great Li bureaucratic waters were also noted in Zhu Lian’s letter.

Regarding the two water-and-land ceremonies and the grand ritual at Book Letter Lake, Zhu Lian wrote in detail, covering every aspect he could.

He even detailed the reputation of the Blind Daoist and his two disciples at the Grass Head Shop in Qilong Lane, describing how things were going.

He also mentioned that Lu Baixiang had recently taken in two disciples, a pair of siblings named Yuanbao and Yuanlai, both promising martial arts talents. When Chen Ping An, the mountain lord, returned to his homeland, he could take some time to record their names in the genealogy of the Ruined Mountain’s Ancestor Hall.

There were also accounts of studying experiences at the Dasi Cliff Academy.

The most crucial matter was on the last piece of paper, concerning the spiritual aura of the Lotus Root Blessed Land. With the arrival of two significant deposits of Grain Rain money, several key waterways had been greatly solidified and nourished. Next, they needed to start engaging with the emperor of the Southern Garden Kingdom, who had already expressed his intention to abdicate and retire to become a cultivator. Given the instability of the new emperor’s position, there would naturally be more concessions to be made.

However, regarding the overarching decisions for this small blessed land, Zhu Lian hoped Chen Ping An would personally provide a conclusive answer. He and Zheng Dafeng, along with Wei Bo, would proceed methodically according to the plan.

In addition to various matters related to his own mountain, Zhu Lian also mentioned numerous external affairs.

The Great Li Dynasty had promoted two cavalry generals who had fought their way into the Zhu Ying Dynasty, Cao Ping and Su Gaoshan, to become newly established Inspectors in Great Li’s history.

It was said that this was a position specially created by the late emperor for meritorious military generals, dubbed “Supreme Pillar.” The Cao family was originally a surname associated with the Supreme Pillar, while Su Gaoshan now had enough confidence to stand on equal footing with the elite families of the Supreme Pillar. Rumors suggested that the Great Li Dynasty would ultimately establish six “Inspectors” positions: one in the heart of the Great Li, one near Old Dragon City, and one in the lands previously belonging to the Zhu Ying Dynasty. As for who would sit in the remaining three chairs and their locations, that had yet to be determined, with no speculations even available.

Moreover, in many places of fallen nations, unrest was rising, and local cultivators were openly assassinating Great Li officials stationed there.

Apart from Cao Ping and Su Gaoshan continuing southward, the last cavalry unit halted its advance, with some troops remaining in the territory of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, splitting forces to return north and quell the rebellion.

The letter was filled with numerous pieces of information, large and small.

After carefully reading Zhu Lian’s letter twice, Chen Ping An then picked up the letter from Pei Qian, which only contained two sheets of paper.

Both pages were filled with her self-praising words.

She was diligent in copying books, never on credit.

Her self-created Crazy Sword Technique was reaching new heights, practically at the pinnacle.

She had a close relationship with Zhou Mi Li, and now the little water monster had become the right protector of the Grass Head Shop in Qilong Lane. She inquired whether her master would appoint her as the right protector of the Ruined Mountain upon returning home. There was a hint of “there’s no silver here” in her letter, as Pei Qian stated she wouldn’t casually promise Zhou Mi Li such a significant title, maintaining a clear distinction between public and private affairs. Despite her good relationship with Zhou Mi Li, she would remain impartial, so it was necessary for her master to make a decision upon returning home.

She also mentioned that her sister Cen Yuanji practiced her boxing very seriously, proving to be a martial genius personally chosen by the old chef to join the mountain. However, one time, while Cen sister was too focused on her practice and accidentally twisted her ankle, Pei Qian happened to pass by and couldn’t catch her in time, which left her feeling guilty until the moment she wrote the letter. 

Thus, if Cen sister ever brought it up, her master must not blame her, as it was truly an unintentional mistake on Pei Qian's part.

Upon reading this, Chen Ping An sensed there was something more to it.

She must have done something related to eating chestnuts and was laying the groundwork in the letter.

Moreover, Pei Qian likely didn’t realize that she had written so much about what she saw and heard in Ruined Mountain while not mentioning even a word about how much silver the Grass Head Shop earned. From Chen Ping An's perspective, it was clear she had skipped class too often at the academy.

Chen Ping An didn’t dwell on it, as Zhu Lian was keeping an eye on things, and it shouldn’t lead to anything too outrageous. If it did, he believed Zhu Lian would directly point it out in the letter.

However, when he returned, a good serving of chestnuts would be in order to make sure she was well-fed. In her letter, she hadn’t mentioned a single word about her academic progress, so could it be said she was attentive to her studies? With her personality, if she received even a small compliment from the academy master, would she not find a way to show it off?

Pei Qian also mentioned that Xiu Xiu was no longer at Shen Xiu Mountain, having heard that she had moved elsewhere to cultivate. Pei Qian was somewhat worried about Xiu Xiu, as it had been a long time since she bought pastries at the Grass Head Shop.

Pei Qian wrote that a beautiful sister named Sui Jing Cheng had arrived on the mountain. Not only was she good-looking, but she was also very generous, spending money without a second thought. However, as the master’s first disciple, Pei Qian maintained her dignity and never once asked Sui Jing Cheng to buy anything for her.

At the end of the letter, Pei Qian wished her master a smooth journey, abundant wealth, happiness every day, safety, and a quick return home.

Upon seeing this, Chen Ping An felt a pang of reluctance to scold her for the chestnuts.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 654: When the Real Man Arrives, He Knocks on the Door**

At one end of the long bridge, two Taoists, one old and one young, spent two Snowflake Coins to get two wooden tokens made from the Celestial Mandarins tree.

Zhang Shanfeng quietly asked, "Master, does your illusion really work? It feels like there are still so many people watching us. Besides, we come from the Prone Peak, so there’s nothing embarrassing about it. Back when I traveled, no one ever guessed I was from Prone Peak, not even when they mistook me for disciples of Taoshan or Zhixuan. According to you, Master, when I just say I'm an outsider Celestial Master from Zhongtu Longhu Mountain, no one believes that either.”

The Fire Dragon True Man smiled, "It must be that your senior brothers don’t have much of a reputation."

Zhang Shanfeng sighed, “I think the skills of my senior brothers are quite high.”

The Fire Dragon True Man chuckled, "Every time they slowly make their way up the mountain and awkwardly come down, how can you tell their skills are high?”

Zhang Shanfeng nodded vigorously and lowered his voice, "I’ve heard from the disciples on the mountain a few times that senior brothers and sisters who can venture out to establish a sect have astonishing realms."

The Fire Dragon True Man asked with a grin, "What kind of high is that?"

Zhang Shanfeng shook his head, "There’s no certainty. Some say they're Golden Core Earth Immortals, others say they must be Dragon Gate Realm Immortals."

At this point, Zhang Shanfeng spoke with utmost seriousness, "Master, even though we at Prone Peak don’t allow casually discussing realms, the younger disciples are just being naive. Please don’t get angry when we get back; otherwise, how can I continue cultivating at Prone Peak? They’ll just end up cursing me behind my back for being a nosy little uncle!”

The Fire Dragon True Man nodded with a smile.

Still feeling uneasy, Zhang Shanfeng insisted, "Master, you have to assure me, or I’ll feel uneasy."

He couldn't help but be nervous; ever since he could remember, he had only seen his master lose his temper once.

A senior brother who could leave Prone Peak to establish his own mountain got into an argument with another senior brother who stayed at Prone Peak. Perhaps the reasoning was unclear, and they ended up discussing their realms. 

The senior brother who was criticized didn’t think it was a big deal, but unexpectedly, the master, who had been sleeping for two or three years, shook off the snow from the peak and vanished from Prone Peak.

At that time, young Zhang Shanfeng was busy having a snowball fight with a few peers. When they noticed the master’s sudden departure, they exchanged glances and continued their snowball fight. After all, snow was a rare occurrence at Prone Peak, and it only happened when the master was asleep; it was a delight, even more joyous than the New Year.

Later, Zhang Shanfeng learned that the senior brother who had merely misspoken was expelled from the sect that very day. He knelt at the edge of Prone Peak for an entire month, bowing his head for a month without any change of heart from the master. The other senior brothers had all gone up to Prone Peak, but none dared to speak, standing there like they had committed grave errors, just as severe as that senior brother.

As someone who was still quite young, Zhang Shanfeng was the only one brave enough to inquire about the matter, driven by curiosity as to why his master was so angry.

When all the other disciples had already left Prone Peak, the master only said two things to Zhang Shanfeng.

“There are no such things as heartless words in this world, only heartful words that are spoken carelessly.”

“People down the mountain are inconsequential, but people up here are critical; it either takes the life of a cultivator or claims the lives of countless ordinary folk down below.”

Zhang Shanfeng had wanted to plead for that senior brother, but the Fire Dragon True Man just shook his head, gently patting the young Taoist on the head, saying it was best this way. Since that senior brother had reached the end of the road in his cultivation on the mountain, it was better for him to go outside and reflect on himself.

At this moment on the long bridge, the old true man could only promise, “Alright, Master will pretend he hasn’t heard about this.”

As they walked along the bridge, Zhang Shanfeng noticed a sharp-eyed boy in yellow standing not far away, seemingly lost in thought, looking at the two of them. Then the boy turned and ran away, disappearing in an instant.

Zhang Shanfeng asked in confusion, “What’s going on with that boy, Master?”

The Fire Dragon True Man smiled, “I’ve seen him before; we’ve interacted.”

On the other side, Li Yuan was sweating profusely, running for his life. “I’ve seen you, old man! You’re the one who trapped me under the Great Flood with your water techniques for a whole month!”

The Fire Dragon True Man frowned and turned to look. It was Sun Jie, the sect leader, who had also employed an illusion technique.

Sun Jie forced himself to step forward quickly. There was no choice; if this old true man were merely passing by the Water Dragon Sect, he wouldn’t mind not showing up, but since the old man was clearly going to the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven, it would be improper for him to still be at the Patriarch Hall. It was better to at least receive some reprimands from the old man than to lose face for his own sect.

Although the Fire Dragon True Man was reluctant to engage in social pleasantries, the other party was a sect leader after all, so he said, “I’m just here to take a stroll with my disciple.”

At the same time, he communicated clearly to Sun Jie, “Sect Leader Sun, my disciple isn’t very aware of the matters down the mountain; please cover for him a bit.”

Sun Jie immediately understood, bowed, and smiled, “I’ve seen the true man.”

The Fire Dragon True Man nodded in acknowledgment.

Zhang Shanfeng was puzzled, not even knowing how to address the other party, so he could only return the greeting with a bow, “Junior Zhang Shanfeng pays respects to the senior.”

Sun Jie quickly returned the courtesy.

The Fire Dragon True Man’s direct disciple deserved this single salute from the Water Dragon Sect leader.

This left Zhang Shanfeng feeling flustered, and he could only bow again in respect.

The Fire Dragon True Man felt somewhat helpless.

Sun Jie also felt that the situation was awkward, so he stopped with the formalities and simply said he would accompany the true man for a while.

Whenever the Fire Dragon True Man descended the mountain to travel, he usually did so alone, rarely having disciples by his side. Whether it was the unfortunate Taixia Yuanjun who had passed away or various disciples from Taoshan and Zhixuan, none had ever followed that old man who loved to nap on his journeys. In fact, Zhang Shanfeng’s descent this time was the second part of a journey after many years. He had traveled south to a different continent, only to be found by his master later, and they had journeyed together through the Central Divine Continent and the Southern Poso Continent. Before that, even during difficult travels, Zhang Shanfeng had been alone, saying he was honing his skills, but in truth, he had just experienced hardship.

Sun Jie escorted the Fire Dragon True Man and Zhang Shanfeng to an inn before taking his leave.

Throughout the journey, it was mostly Zhang Shanfeng chatting with him, worried that his master wouldn’t engage with others, so he had to take on the responsibility.

Just as Sun Jie was about to turn around, the Fire Dragon True Man spoke up, “About Li Yuan, I’ll have a word for you.”

Sun Jie was about to bow again.

The Fire Dragon True Man waved his hand, “No need.”

After Sun Jie, the polite senior, walked away, Zhang Shanfeng quietly said, “Master, why didn’t you talk to him?”

The Fire Dragon True Man smiled and said, “He’s not a friend; there’s no need to chat. Friends aren’t made through conversation.”

With a hint of nostalgia in his expression, he wondered if he had any friends? Of course, he did, and many, but sadly, they were all old acquaintances now.

Living for too long often meant bidding farewell to friends one by one. Some could be bid farewell to in person, while others could not.

Whether it was possible or not was a source of melancholy.

This had nothing to do with the heights of cultivation.

So, this disciple beside him, who could recognize the philosophical Chen Pingan and the landscape writer Xu Yuanxia, was already a good thing.

And Zhang Shanfeng and Chen Pingan both genuinely respected that bearded wanderer even more.

Like-minded spirits, sharing trials and tribulations, even sharing a drink was better than mere alcohol.

Some brotherly bonds could be superficial, hidden beneath a veneer of flowers with hidden daggers.

But certain timely assistance was like friends bringing warmth in the cold, and after delivering it, they would part ways with a smile, saying it was nothing.

With thirty-four more miles to the "Water Dragon Summer Resort" city gate, Zhang Shanfeng asked, “Master, how did you figure out where Chen Pingan is?”

The old true man replied, “It’s quite a difficult task, but Chen Pingan is deeply connected to you. For example, that Celestial Master Seal and the ancient sword you carry were all first obtained by him and then gifted to you. That gave me some clues. Moreover, Chen Pingan happens to be in the North Julu Continent; if he were in another continent, it would be even harder for me to divine.”

In fact, there was another secret the Fire Dragon True Man hadn’t revealed to Zhang Shanfeng. That was the time they met in the alley of a village in the southeast of Baopin Continent; as a return gift, the old true man had given Chen Pingan a meeting gift to help the young man advance on his martial path. After all, this piece of incense-related kindness wasn’t something one could make a topic of conversation.

Moreover, this disciple thought his master’s skills were not high.

The Fire Dragon True Man didn’t feel there was anything wrong about it.

Could the skills of a poor Taoist surpass those of the Dao Ancestor? 

Not at all.

So, they weren’t high.

When they reached the entrance of the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven and heard that they needed to pay two Small Heat Coins, Zhang Shanfeng immediately thought that the Water Dragon Sect was a bit greedy.

Grinding his teeth, Zhang Shanfeng reluctantly pulled out two Small Heat Coins from his sleeve and handed them to the Water Dragon Sect disciple guarding the gate.

As they passed through the city gate, Zhang Shanfeng touched the door nails embedded in the red lacquered door and turned to his master, saying, “Master, do you want to touch it too? Chen Pingan once mentioned many local customs, like walking on the city walls to ward off sickness and touching the door nails to dispel impurities and bad luck.”

The Fire Dragon True Man shook his head, smiling, “I’ll pass.”

After Zhang Shanfeng passed through the gate, he saw a long staircase made of white jade, extending up to 9,999 steps, and couldn’t help but exclaim, “Impressive! Truly impressive! No wonder it’s a sect with a revered name!”

At his own Prone Peak, there was only a winding, overgrown path up the mountain, but it was rich in wild fruits. Before setting out on his travels, Zhang Shanfeng often led a group of young disciples to forage in the mountains, returning each time with an abundant haul.

Reaching the summit, when he saw the sixteen dragon walls beneath him, Zhang Shanfeng felt even more that the Water Dragon Sect was wealthy and extravagant. Thinking that his own two Small Heat Coins contributed to this, he felt somewhat pleased.

The Fire Dragon True Man asked with a laugh, “Are you still thinking that no matter how grand the golden or silver nests, they can’t compare to your own grass nest?”

Zhang Shanfeng nodded, “Of course. After seeing Chen Pingan, I just want to go home!”

The sixteen snowy white dragons soared through the clouds, heading toward the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven.

---

Inside a house on Fushui Island.

Chen Pingan closed his eyes to rest his mind, pondering for a long while. He took out a brush and ink, spread out a sheet of paper, and began to compose a letter.

The name "Lotus Root Blessed Land" was quite fitting; that would be its name.

After the gap was filled, this blessed land was upgraded to a medium blessed land. The future sites for the shrines of the mountain and water deities could continue to be secretly explored to select auspicious locations. However, the Luopo Mountain wasn’t in a rush to sign any contracts with the emperor of the Nanyuan Kingdom; they would wait until he returned to Luopo Mountain to discuss it. By then, he would personally make a trip. Until that time, regardless of how good the emperor’s conditions might be, Zhu Lian would just have to delay.

The breaking of Wei Ban’s realm was a significant event. Luopo Mountain needed someone to prepare a congratulatory gift. Chen Pingan’s gift must be a mountain treasure of a magical quality that could be temporarily borrowed from the True Realm Sect’s Jiang Shangzhen. If Zhu Lian found it appropriate, he could even agree to serve as a nominal protector of Luopo Mountain under the guise of a Nascent Soul identity and Zhou Fei’s alias, with the condition being an extra magical treasure.

As for the congratulatory gifts from the other juniors, such as Pei Qian, a lighter gesture would suffice; for example, Pei Qian could write a festive couplet. Of course, if Pei Qian had more thoughtful ideas, that would be even better.

For Liu Chongrun, Zhu Lian could bring along Lu Baixiang to secretly dig up the Water Palace and the dragon boat; that would be the best outcome. However, before proceeding with this matter, they must first inform Cui Dongshan and wait for his specific reply before both sides could set off from the Great Li. If Cui Dongshan thought this matter wasn’t feasible, then they should directly refuse Liu Chongrun. Moreover, they should remind her to completely give up on this matter, speaking firmly. It wasn’t a big deal; since both sides had become long-term neighbors on the mountain, some harsh truths may be difficult to hear, but saying them was a different matter altogether.

As he wrote this letter, Chen Pingan paused for a moment before continuing.

If Liu Chongrun insisted on taking risks, Luopo Mountain would retract the borrowing of the claw fish back, and the consequences and compensations for breaking the contract would be borne completely by Luopo Mountain. 

It was better to clarify the situation early on than to be caught in an unnecessary disaster caused by the Zhu Chai Island cultivators later. If they wanted to manage Luopo Mountain in the long term, they had to make some choices. It was better to cut ties earlier than to let a greater feud develop later and harbor mutual resentment, even if it meant complaints from Zhu Chai Island for a wasted trip. 

If things really reached that deadlock, they would need to make some additional compensations in secret, such as reaching out to Jiang Shangzhen and Guan Yiran to ask them to look after the situation regarding the Book Lake and Zhu Chai Island, and this matter wouldn’t need to be communicated to Liu Chongrun. These two debts of gratitude owed by Luopo Mountain would be kept in mind for now, and when Chen Pingan returned to Baopin Continent, he would have other plans.

As for Dong Shuijing, Luopo Mountain could help with anything that didn’t involve major issues and would do its best to assist without fussing over profit and loss. However, any help given to Dong Shuijing could not harm the slightest interest of the general Guan Yiran stationed at Pool Water City. This needed careful consideration from Zhu Lian to ensure the right balance. As for the private relationships between Dong Shuijing and the district governor Yuan and Supervisor Cao, Luopo Mountain should not interfere in the least.

However, he could frequently interact with Wei Li, the newly appointed magistrate of Huang Ting Kingdom, who was worth befriending. How he managed this was up to Zhu Lian himself. 

Additionally, regarding that newly emerged city god, since the incense boy of the City God’s Hall was already familiar with Pei Qian, he could remind Pei Qian to take things easy while interacting with that little incense boy. Beyond that, Luopo Mountain should maintain a light and shallow relationship with the newly emerged city god, as the other party’s sudden rise to this position suggested a complex background. For now, Luopo Mountain should prioritize stability to avoid being caught in the crossfire of conflicts among some deities on the Great Li’s temple scene, as the central area of the Great Li was undoubtedly fraught with danger.

For Fan Er and Sun Jiashu in the Old Dragon City, Zhu Lian should take the time to personally visit as a gesture of appreciation on behalf of Chen Pingan. During this time, if Madam Gui from Guihua Island hadn’t traveled across continents, Zhu Lian should also take the initiative to pay a visit. Additionally, for the Golden Core sword cultivator from the Fan family, Old Mr. Ma Zhi, Zhu Lian could bring a flask of wine when visiting. The celestial wine stored near the bamboo house could be dug up to make two jars to present to the old gentleman.

There was no need to concern themselves with the matter of Liu Zhimiao breaking through to the Jade Purity realm.

The Yangzhong Mountain and Qingfeng City Xu family should continue to gather any related news through others.

Additionally, there were over twenty other matters, which Chen Pingan wrote down in this letter. The vast majority were just reminders for Zhu Lian to handle personally. Chen Pingan merely wanted to make him aware of these issues.

Lastly, if there were any matters Chen Pingan had already reached a conclusion about, but Zhu Lian and the other two felt the direction was not right and needed further consideration, they could send a letter to Li Liu. He would definitely visit Lion Peak before returning to Baopin Continent.

Finally, Chen Pingan did not write a separate letter to Pei Qian; he only mentioned at the end of the letter for her to correspond more with her Baopin elder sister and to help him, as her master, send greetings to Chen Ruchu, Chen Lingjun, Zhou Mili, and Shi Rou, who ran the New Year’s shop in Qilong Alley. He also reiterated for her not to be mischievous at school; if she thinks the teachers are lacking in teaching ability, she should learn to be a good person from them. If she felt the teachers were decent, then she should only learn the doctrines of the sages from them.

At the end of this family letter, Chen Pingan assured Pei Qian that he had already agreed to promote the mute monster Zhou Mili from Daba Lake to be Luopo Mountain’s Right Protector, and he allowed Pei Qian to announce this to everyone at Luopo Mountain.

As he wrote this light-hearted line, Chen Pingan himself was unaware, but his face was filled with smiles, his eyes warm.

After completing this, Chen Pingan leaned back in his chair, cradling the back of his head, eyes closed. He thought of the lotus little one, who supposedly still shunned the limelight.

He wondered if the grass and trees along the mountain paths back home would bloom more abundantly with the warmth of spring next year.

Every time the Golden Luofu Daoist Temple was over, the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven would see more rainfall.

Chen Pingan stored the letter away, stepped out of the house, picked up his oil-paper umbrella, and continued on his walk.

He intended to deliver this letter to Li Yuan to be sent to Luopo Mountain after his stroll.

Walking along the bluestone path adjacent to Fushui Island’s mountains and waters, he suddenly turned to look in a direction, faintly seeing a talisman boat slowly approaching.

Aside from Li Yuan and the Water Palace Lady of South Xun, he didn’t have many acquaintances in the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven.

The talisman boat suddenly sped like a flying sword, landing on the lake and stabilizing at the shore.

As Chen Pingan focused, rubbing his eyes to confirm he wasn’t mistaken, he quickly used the "Junqing Yu Xiang" jade token to remove the magical prohibitions of Fushui Island.

The Fire Dragon True Man had already lifted the illusion covering the two of them, and Zhang Shanfeng laughed, “Chen Pingan!”

Chen Pingan smiled and asked, “What brings you here? I was planning to finish my stroll here before going to find you at Prone Peak!”

Zhang Shanfeng strode forward, approaching Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan handed the oil-paper umbrella in his hand to Zhang Shanfeng, then bent slightly and clasped his fists, saying, “Junior Chen Pingan pays respects to the old true man.”

“Not old, not old; just call me true man.”

The Fire Dragon True Man nodded at the young man with a smile, and as soon as they touched down from the talisman boat, the rain on Fushui Island instantly ceased.

Zhang Shanfeng was taken aback, putting away the oil-paper umbrella and cheerfully saying, “Good omen! Good omen!”

Then, he gestured at Chen Pingan’s height, wondering, “Chen Pingan, you’ve grown so tall!”

It turned out that Chen Pingan was now about a fist taller than the young Taoist.

In fact, several years had passed since they last met.

Chen Pingan felt a bit embarrassed next, as he was alone on Fushui Island, and it was naturally fine, but it was a different story with the old true man present. He had wine, but that was clearly not suitable, and while there were some refreshments at the Caique Mansion, he was utterly clueless about how to brew tea, having mastered six out of seven skills but lacking the final one, and he had no tea set either.

The Fire Dragon True Man looked at the young man and teased, “If you’re limping, then you must be in trouble, right?”

Chen Pingan苦笑着点头。

Under the watchful eye of the old true man, Zhang Shanfeng gently elbowed Chen Pingan, who returned the gesture. 

The Fire Dragon True Man ignored this, continuing to walk slowly, while the two young men walked beside him.

The old master then asked, “Such a good literary heart, yet you lost it; how did that happen? If you had the support of gold, water, and soil, you wouldn’t be struggling to climb the mountain.”

Upon hearing this, Zhang Shanfeng immediately ceased his playful banter with Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan replied, “I encountered some challenges and couldn’t convince my heart. Some principles can’t just be used to constrain others.”

The old true man laughed and asked, “I’m curious; what principle needed such a heavy price?”

Chen Pingan hesitated for a moment but still provided a rough answer, “A person I could easily kill hundreds of times if we met, yet I just can’t bring myself to do it.”

The old true man responded with an “Mm,” adding, “When the literary heart shatters, that little bit of moral atmosphere you gathered will collapse and scatter. So, what’s next? When will it come to an end?”

Chen Pingan fell silent.

The old true man chuckled, “Drink a little wine, think it over, and then speak again.”

Chen Pingan took off the sword-raising gourd, which was now filled with hometown glutinous rice wine, took a gentle sip, and offered it to Zhang Shanfeng, who gestured with his eyes, indicating that his master was present.

The old true man continued, “With such a heavy selfishness, why can’t you just kill? If that’s the case, in my opinion, that literary heart will shatter on its own if you don’t break it.”

Chen Pingan took another sip of wine.

The old true man laughed and extended a hand, “Did you exhaust all your calculation, using every bit of knowledge, and barely reach today? For example, using the Buddhist method of subduing the heart’s monkey, turning one of your thoughts into a monkey and locking it in your heart, seeing that detestable person as a wild horse, confined in a certain place? As for how to correct the mistake, that’s even more complex, combining the laws of the Legalists, the measurements of the magicians, the Buddhist teachings, Taoist fasting, trying to piece together the Confucian rules into practical compensatory measures, isn’t that right? Hoping that one day in the future, you and that person will realize the error year after year, eventually repaying this world? If one wrong leads to another, then make up for the larger one, and eventually, you’ll find some peace, right?”

Chen Pingan’s expression darkened as he tightly gripped the sword-raising gourd.

The old true man nodded but then shook his head, sighing, “How difficult it is.”

Zhang Shanfeng didn’t dare to breathe.

The old true man smiled and asked, “Have you considered where the key in this heart’s examination lies?”

The old true man answered his own question, “Whether it is killing others first, then yourself, or killing yourself first, then thinking about killing others.”

Chen Pingan was lost in thought, muttering, “Isn’t it necessary to first look at right and wrong before discussing anything else?”

The old true man laughed, “Then I must ask you again, why is it that this person, right before you, cannot be killed?”

Chen Pingan had no answer.

The old true man laughed, “Because you know that if you harbor the intent to kill, it is already killing yourself. Before you kill him, you have already died. Chen Pingan, is this hard to understand? You are too intelligent, your understanding of human nature far exceeds your peers. Many of the choices made in the dark are entirely in line with your heart; it has nothing to do with the principles you uphold. That is the most fundamental thought and recognition hidden deep within you, and you don’t need to twist it around in your mind. Hence, it seems like you’re unaware, but in reality, it’s very clear.”

Zhang Shanfeng found this particularly hard to comprehend.

And he also felt heartbroken.

The young Taoist had thought that this long-awaited reunion would only bring good things and that there wouldn’t be any troubling matters.

Zhang Shanfeng regretted bringing his master to Fushui Island.

The Fire Dragon True Man shook his head, “In your eyes, Chen Pingan, if you kill this person, it seems all the stages of your life, from childhood to youth and the travels that followed, would die entirely. Everyone you know and who knows you, especially those who are no longer in this world, seem to die along with them. Ultimately, is it not your own selfishness at work? You are too afraid of death. You fear your own death, and you fear others’ hearts towards you dying.”

Chen Pingan stood still, the sword-raising gourd gently falling to the ground.

The Fire Dragon True Man smiled at Zhang Shanfeng, “Let’s keep walking, so that Chen Pingan can think it over; there’s no rush.”

Zhang Shanfeng felt like he was about to burst into flames from anxiety.

Only when the old true man shook his head did Zhang Shanfeng tightly grip the oil-paper umbrella that Chen Pingan had handed over, accompanying his master as they continued their walk.

After walking a distance, Zhang Shanfeng, worried, turned to ask softly, “Master, leaving Chen Pingan alone there, is that really okay?”

The Fire Dragon True Man replied calmly, “When has Chen Pingan ever not been alone?”

Zhang Shanfeng was stunned.

The old true man smiled, “It’s not that Chen Pingan isn’t sincere with you; it’s just that this kid has been accustomed to it since he was young.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked, “Is that a bad thing?”

The old true man pondered, “To reach today’s point is naturally not a bad thing; it’s a good thing. But if it remains the same after today, then….”

Zhang Shanfeng asked the same question again, “Is it a bad thing?”

Unexpectedly, the Fire Dragon True Man shook his head and smiled, “A greater good thing. It’s just that he hasn’t fully realized it yet. If he can’t break through that bottleneck, then it becomes a bad thing. This point, if he can’t see through it, can’t acknowledge it, it’s a disaster of the greatest kind; it’s the greatest inner demon.”

The heart barrier is the ghost gate; lingering outside the ghost gate, one can easily blur the line between human and ghost. So often, there are people from the underworld and ghosts in the living world, hard to distinguish.

Common folk are easier to discuss; they merely seek to live and live better. Whether they are human or ghost, there’s no definite theorem. But for cultivators, a muddy heart can lead to troubles.

Zhang Shanfeng scratched his head, “Master, I really can’t understand all this.”

The old true man chuckled, “Because you don’t need to understand. People are merely a difference between one world and another.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked, “Master, if you say others have heavy selfishness, I can’t argue, but if you say Chen Pingan has heavy selfishness, I don’t think that’s right.”

The old true man shook his head, “It’s not a derogatory term, so there’s no need to defend him.”

Suddenly, Zhang Shanfeng stopped and said, “Master, I won’t walk anymore. I’ll just stay here and watch Chen Pingan; otherwise, I won’t be at ease.”

The old true man nodded, “Very well.”

Zhang Shanfeng grumbled, “What’s so good about it?”

The old true man smiled as he continued forward, walking a circle around the island.

Moreover, the old true man was also curious about what answer the young man would eventually come up with.

Zhang Shanfeng squatted in place. Although it wasn’t raining, feeling too idle, he opened the umbrella and gazed at the distant figure standing by the water.

The Fire Dragon True Man continued walking, moving slowly.

But Fushui Island was only about thirty miles in distance; the Fire Dragon True Man still reached near Chen Pingan, gazing out over the lake scenery together. It was rain-free on Fushui Island, but other islands in the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven were drenched in heavy rain. The night sky and the rain intertwined, with the rain falling into the lake, further blurring the view.

Chen Pingan slowly spoke, “Old true man, there’s something I’ve never shared with anyone.”

The Fire Dragon True Man said, “Feel free to speak; let it out.”

Chen Pingan took a deep breath. “I’ve traveled quite a bit in my life, but looking back, the greatest test of my life was that peaceful period over the mountains and waters. It wasn’t the mountain-moving ape that almost killed me in my hometown, nor was it Master Lu from Qingming Heaven, and it wasn’t the sword boat that pierced my abdomen, nor the endless schemes and battles. The most unsettling time was spent with one of the people I respect most; he’s a swordsman named A Liang.”

The Fire Dragon True Man calmly replied, “A child who views a strange world with trepidation must speculate on others with the worst intentions, only to find later that their own good intentions were so fragile. The higher A Liang’s swordsmanship, the higher his nature, the more he can embrace the world. In the future, this child will feel more lost, feeling more guilt. This is a stark contrast to the mindset of Mr. Qi, who was initially seen as a god.”

The Fire Dragon True Man encouraged, “Continue; I’ll listen and forget after hearing.”

Chen Pingan continued, “I later learned that worldly relationships can indeed be influenced by those at the mountain’s peak, so I’m very afraid that the girl I like doesn’t actually like me for who I am. That frightens me.”

At this point, Chen Pingan chuckled, “But after thinking it through, I still believe she wouldn’t, because she is Ning Yao. There’s only one Ning Yao in a thousand or ten thousand years. So, there are no ‘what-ifs’ or ‘retreating ten thousand steps.’”

The Fire Dragon True Man laughed, “What else?”

Chen Pingan said, “I’m very afraid I will become the kind of person I hated the most when I was younger. So I’ve always feared becoming one of the people on the mountain. After witnessing the sword immortal’s brilliance, I admired them greatly. However, after traveling far and wide, seeing the sufferings of the world, I increasingly resisted the so-called grand feats of leveling mountains with a sword or shattering cities with a punch. But then I realized I didn’t need to fear it. If I cultivate my strength to the peak and keep my heart in check, I can make those who act solely for their own pleasure feel absolutely unpleasurable. In that case, I would find joy.”

The Fire Dragon True Man exclaimed, “This notion is something I’ve never heard before as an old true man; it has some substance, good, very good.”

Chen Pingan said, “That heart examination was a loss for me, but thanks to the old true man’s insight, I had no choice but to admit my selfishness. Before that, I always deliberately thought of the complexities of the world as deeper and messier. Regarding myself, I would subconsciously think that if the literary heart shattered, I could avoid the deeper inquiry. In reality, that was an evasion. Just as the old true man said, selfishness takes its toll. While heavy selfishness isn’t terrifying, what’s terrifying is acting according to that heart without realizing it. Once you know, you don’t have to fear it. When something reaches its worst state, as long as you have the spirit to rise again, it can get better.”

The old true man shook his head, “That’s still not enough.”

“I hold grudges, and there are quite a few people I wish to kill but can’t. I can only endure it. But I don’t fear waiting; I fear that after waiting too long, I’ll find that my reasoning has changed, and I’ve lost my motive for killing. That’s why I hope to have the power to kill before new reasoning emerges!”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment before saying, “Moreover, I’ve always had the least courage. As a child, I feared ghosts. After my parents died, I didn’t stop fearing ghosts, I just changed my way of escaping. My best friend, Liu Xianyang, knew that when I was an apprentice at the Dragon Kiln, the thing I feared most was getting sick. During those days when I hadn’t trained in martial arts or cultivated, I had already begun to grasp any clues about the small world of the human body. I started trying to connect the subtle changes of the seasons and the shifts of the atmosphere.”

“Even before I left my hometown, I began to disguise myself. I wanted to be a grateful child in the neighborhood, making everyone feel that I wasn’t a troublemaker. I wouldn’t steal or rob; I would never become the troublemaker of Mud Bottle Alley, nor the disaster child in the mouths of the old folks, because I knew that once I lost certain protections, I would be doomed to perish. Even when I was young, just starting to understand things, I learned how to please everyone around me. I often stared at the empty medicine pot that no longer boiled medicine; looking at it for a long time made me realize I needed to master the timing. So I secretly cleaned the winter snow in the streets, knowing that if I did it once or twice, no one would notice, but if I did it ten or twenty times, someone would notice. I helped the elderly fetch water, helped my peers climb trees to retrieve paper kites, and I would lend a hand during joyful events. I would do as much farming work as I could, making sure they didn’t see me as the clever boy who had thought of doing all these things but as the kind-hearted child. Before going to the Dragon Kiln as an apprentice, I had already been doing these things, and it became second nature. Even after becoming an apprentice, I continued this way. So even now, arriving at Fushui Island in North Julu, I can’t help but think, who exactly is Chen Pingan? Am I truly a good person? Previously, when I observed the night trial beside a city god’s temple, the city god said that having a heart for good deeds, while good, isn’t rewarded, and that made me feel guilty. The water and land Daoist ceremonies at Shujian Lake and the recent Golden Luofu Daoist Temple events made me feel even guiltier when Li Yuan said that heaven and humanity resonate, and I heard it, which made me feel even more guilty.”

After patiently listening to this young man’s endless thoughts, the Fire Dragon True Man asked, “So, Chen Pingan, do you feel there are things or people that are just and right?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Of course. For example, my parents were good people. In this life, I will only love Ning Yao. I want Mr. Qi to see more of the mountains and rivers. I want to become a swordsman like A Liang! I’ve met many truly good people, and I don’t want my cultivation to be just about myself. I hope that when I encounter any injustices in the future, I can strike with my fist or sword without hesitation. I hope that principles are principles, not something to be used when convenient and dismissed when not, that all weak people in the world can speak up and that the strong are willing to respect others.”

After a pause, Chen Pingan slowly added, “I also hope that every child growing up in Mud Bottle Alley can be a truly good person without needing to calculate so much.”

The Fire Dragon True Man asked, “So, to conclude, I ask you, has your heart truly understood? Who exactly is Chen Pingan from Mud Bottle Alley?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “It seems there’s no answer.”

The old true man chuckled and asked, “Then do you want to keep thinking? If you keep thinking, when will it end?”

It was still an old question.

Going in circles, it was as if the old true man had walked a circle around Fushui Island and returned.

But don’t underestimate this circle.

Daoism advocates returning to simplicity.

Seeking the truth.

Chen Pingan clasped his hands in his sleeves, staring blankly into the distance. After a long silence, he smiled and spoke a line that wasn’t quite an answer but also felt like one.

After hearing this, the Fire Dragon True Man nodded, not feeling that this young man was being perfunctory. For someone as intelligent as Chen Pingan, it would be too easy to deceive others; self-deception, however, was challenging.

Thus, the old true man sighed inwardly, thinking that the way the sage received his disciples’ insights was indeed as good as his own.

The Fire Dragon True Man asked, “Have you given any thought to the third life item? Do you have any plans?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I do.”

The Fire Dragon True Man asked, “Do you need me to lend a hand?”

Chen Pingan smiled and said, “I do.”

The Fire Dragon True Man nodded, “That’s settled.”

This was a straightforward exchange, devoid of any lingering doubts after that heart examination.

The old true man patted the young man on the shoulder, “Go on, catch up with Shanfeng. I’ll stay here to enjoy the scenery.”

Chen Pingan took his leave.

The old true man remained in place.

The Fire Dragon True Man let out a slight sigh.

He recalled Chen Pingan’s earlier response.

What a fine remark: “I’ve wrestled long enough with myself; I would rather be myself.”

**(The End of This Chapter)**

 **Chapter 655: Not Just Farewells to Others**

Upon noticing Chen Ping'an walking towards him, Zhang Shanfeng stood up, tucked away his oiled paper umbrella, and approached Chen Ping'an, then began to back away, worriedly asking, “Is everything alright?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, saying, “If there’s a problem, it’s not a big one.”

Zhang Shanfeng snapped, “Speak in a way I can understand!”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “That means there’s nothing wrong.”

Zhang Shanfeng pressed, “Really?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “More real than the money of the immortals.”

Thinking of this, Zhang Shanfeng groaned, “The Water Dragon Sect is not being fair; just to enter the Dragon Palace’s cave heaven, they charge a small fortune.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “I currently owe over two thousand Grain Rain coins.”

Zhang Shanfeng calculated quickly. Just as Chen Ping'an said to stop, Zhang Shanfeng blurted out, “That’s over two hundred thousand Snowflake coins?!”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his face. 

When it came to making money, he loved converting one Grain Rain coin into Snowflake coins, but when in debt, he couldn’t bear it at all. 

Suddenly, Zhang Shanfeng said, “Chen Ping'an, some things, friends can’t help with; you can only figure them out on your own, bit by bit.” 

The first time he descended the mountain and ventured out, as an outsider disciple of Longhu Mountain, he had a tough time almost not making it through. Eventually, he steeled himself and went straight to Baoping Continent, where he met Chen Ping'an and Xu Yuanxia, slowly opening up his heart and even realizing a clumsy set of martial arts that was not meant for the stage.

Chen Ping'an lightly hummed in agreement.

The deepest inquiries of the heart were the sharpest.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an’s state of mind was, of course, far from as relaxed as his words and expression suggested.

Zhang Shanfeng pulled out a porcelain bottle from his bag. “This bottle of water elixir was given to me by a friend of my master from the Middle Earth Shenzhao. He said since you gifted me the Tianshi Seal and the Zhenwu Sword, I should return the favor.”

Chen Ping'an was taken aback. He didn’t hesitate to accept the porcelain bottle, and feeling the coolness in his palm, he couldn’t help but ask curiously, “The Water God from Shenzhao gifted this?”

The Lord of Cangyun Lake had also sent him water elixirs before. He had once seen the water elixirs from Liu Chongrun's secret collection, but compared to the bottle of Shenzhao Water Elixir in his hand, it was like comparing clouds to mud.

The book on the upside-down mountain mentioned Shenzhao as a large swamp in Middle Earth, could it be the water elixir refined from the life water of the Lord of Shenzhao?

Zhang Shanfeng nodded. “It’s indeed the Shenzhao Water Elixir, but my master said its quality isn’t too high. He mentioned that his relationship with the various Water Gods around the world is average, so he couldn't get the best elixirs.”

Chen Ping'an found this a bit amusing. What the Fire Dragon Real Man considered “the best” would indeed be the best in all of Haoran World. What he referred to as “not too high” must still be quite impressive.

Shenzhao was extremely famous in Middle Earth. Its vast waters were guarded by a deity of the upper fifth realm, and the water palace was the renowned Chenchi Palace, reputed to be the largest dragon king's lair in the world. The legends surrounding the ruins of Shenzhao were numerous; it was said that an unknown Daoist once rowed a boat on a bright moonlit night, where a flood dragon fleeing from heavenly calamity entered Shenzhao, and the chains of thunder and lightning obscured the sky. That flood dragon escaped into the Daoist's sleeve, with the Daoist casually repelling the heavenly calamity, allowing the flood dragon to avoid disaster, leading to later poetry that described, “Under the thunder, there’s nowhere to hide, it flew into the scholar’s robes.”

Chen Ping'an held the heavy bottle of water elixir and turned to Zhang Shanfeng, softly saying, “You have a good master, Zhang Shanfeng.”

Zhang Shanfeng smiled, “I’ve known that for a long time.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “And the old real man has a good disciple.”

Zhang Shanfeng shook his head, “Disciples like me are plentiful on the Padi Peak.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I don’t see many.”

Zhang Shanfeng’s face lit up with a smile, “Just saying some big truths.”

Chen Ping'an pulled the young Daoist into an embrace, and Zhang Shanfeng bent down, ready to return the gesture.

They joked and laughed.

Chen Ping'an led Zhang Shanfeng into the courtyard, into the house.

Zhang Shanfeng caught sight of the green bamboo walking stick and the sword immortal on the wall, laughing, “Same old, same old.”

Chen Ping'an fetched a chair for him, and they sat facing each other.

Zhang Shanfeng began sharing stories of his travels with his master through Middle Earth and Nanpusa Continent, eventually talking about Liu Xianyang, who studied under the esteemed Chen family.

Chen Ping'an quietly listened to Zhang Shanfeng’s account, his mind at peace, the ripples settling.

Zhang Shanfeng then began to recount his journey back home but suddenly noticed that the guy across from him had listened so intently that he had fallen asleep.

Zhang Shanfeng felt a bit helpless, quietly stood up, and softly left the room. After gently closing the door, he squatted under the eaves, lost in thought.

The world was strange; some people focused solely on what others had without considering why. His master said this was called a “leaf obstructing the eye” and that the stranger part of the world was that such thinking wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.

Zhang Shanfeng always felt out of place in this world, and it had little to do with levels of achievement.

He could only slowly cultivate on Padi Peak, or travel the rivers and lakes with Chen Ping'an and Xu Yuanxia, or simply be alone, facing the silent and serene mountains and waters, keeping his distance from the hustle and bustle. He wouldn’t make mistakes that harmed others, and the world wouldn’t harm him. Only then would he feel a bit better.

Zhang Shanfeng asked his master if there was a significant problem with his questioning heart.

His master said there was no issue, explaining that Confucianism was about addition—cultivating oneself, governing the family, ruling the state, bringing peace to the world—all responsibilities taken upon oneself, leading to the Middle Earth Confucian Temple. Daoism was about subtraction, where one could clearly draw lines, sever connections, and forget the self and object without worry, leading ultimately to tranquility. Buddhism transitioned from self-liberation to liberating others, gradually realizing enlightenment, with the precepts, concentration, and wisdom being stages of increase and decrease. While the three teachings seemed to differ greatly, their paths and directions were fundamentally the same, as cultivation was ultimately about the person on the road.

Zhang Shanfeng squatted on the steps, turning to glance at the closed door.

His master was right; everyone is a small universe. Once the door is closed, outsiders cannot see the true scene inside.

At that moment, inside the house, Chen Ping'an gently called out, “Zhang Shanfeng.”

Zhang Shanfeng quickly replied, “Here, just outside.”

Chen Ping'an then said, his tone slightly weary, “Then I’ll sleep a bit more. I never felt it before, but I’m a bit tired.”

Zhang Shanfeng said, “Rest well.”

Zhang Shanfeng, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, squatted in place, gently swaying back and forth, a smile on his face.

There were some children down the hill, extremely precocious. Whether they would ultimately become cultivators on the mountain wasn’t surprising.

What was truly strange was the coexistence of two extreme philosophies and characters constantly clashing without harming anyone. From Fire Dragon Real Man’s perspective, that was true cultivation and refinement.

The innate pure mindset was hard to maintain without losing it, while the acquired sincerity was challenging to find. The true essence of sincerity, when achieved, shone like the sun and glimmered like the moon.

His disciple Zhang Shanfeng and his friend Chen Ping'an had two different mindsets, requiring two different teachings.

Fire Dragon Real Man felt a bit frustrated with the Confucian sage and Qi Jingchun. Why, having recognized disciples and junior disciples separately, didn’t they pay more attention? Why let Chen Ping'an wander so far alone? Didn’t they fear he might meet misfortune or abandon his path to become a monk, or perhaps truly understand and turn to Daoism? This was something Fire Dragon Real Man couldn’t comprehend—why the Confucian sage didn’t choose to keep Chen Ping'an close, teaching him by example. It was also odd that Qi Jingchun, even if he had to die, could have done so much more with his knowledge and abilities, yet he didn’t.

Truly, each was bigger-hearted than the last.

Fire Dragon Real Man considered himself quite broad-minded, yet compared to these two scholars, he felt he still fell short.

Suddenly, Fire Dragon Real Man uttered a soft “eh,” looking around as if he encountered something perplexing, but after a moment’s thought, he lazily dismissed it.

**Between the Islands of Baijia and Cangyan.**

A carriage suspended in the water, with Li Yuan and the goddess Shen Lin standing side by side.

Shen Lin was surprised, “This person actually knows Fire Dragon Real Man?”

Li Yuan sneered, “I know that old man too.”

Shen Lin smiled, of course she recognized him, having been suppressed by Fire Dragon Real Man with water techniques for over a month at the bottom of the lake.

Though the North Julu Continent firmly believed that this old real man from Padi Peak was the world’s most skilled practitioner of fire techniques, few knew that Fire Dragon Real Man was also quite proficient with water techniques.

Shen Lin had many thoughts.

Just then, Li Yuan felt a chill on his scalp.

It turned out the old real man on the shore waved cheerfully at the carriage.

Li Yuan was about to scatter into golden light and escape but hesitated, for Fire Dragon Real Man had already appeared next to the carriage, standing on the back of a pure white steed.

Shen Lin immediately bowed respectfully, saying, “This is Shen Lin from South Xun Water Palace, I pay my respects to Fire Dragon Real Man!”

Fire Dragon Real Man was relatively polite towards this water goddess, smiling, “All things follow nature, and walk with fate; when the water flows, it naturally gathers.”

A face as delicate as shattered green glaze trembled slightly, and Shen Lin replied in a trembling voice, “Thank you for your teachings, Real Man.”

Fire Dragon Real Man smiled and remained silent, glancing at Li Yuan, “Oh, isn’t this our Li Yuan from the Jidu Temple? Wherever I go, I can always see you, Li Yuan. What a fated encounter, truly unstoppable.”

Li Yuan kept a straight face, pretending to be deaf and mute.

What’s the deal? Just because your Dao techniques are high doesn’t mean you can bully me, right?

Fire Dragon Real Man chuckled, “Li Yuan, since you’re free, why not have a chat with me?”

Li Yuan looked confused, “I’m busy, very busy.”

Fire Dragon Real Man shook his sleeve, “Oh?”

Li Yuan immediately said, “I can not be busy for now.”

An old Taoist and a young man left the carriage and walked on water.

Shen Lin used her divine powers to steer the carriage back to the summer palace.

Once Shen Lin left, Li Yuan immediately began to flatter, “Old Brother Fire Dragon, why did you come to the Water Dragon Cave Heaven as a guest without a word? Isn’t that a bit cold? Do you look down on your little brother who’s struggling?”

Fire Dragon Real Man hummed in acknowledgment.

Yes, indeed, I look down on you, Li Yuan.

Li Yuan felt it was pointless to continue the conversation.

As the esteemed Water Justice who was currently in the water, he felt as if he was in a cage, completely out of sorts.

After a long silence, they swiftly traveled through the water, their forms light and ethereal like smoke.

Fire Dragon Real Man finally spoke, “Since the establishment of the Water Dragon Sect, they haven’t treated you poorly, so why do you still act so high and mighty? Do you need to place the ancestral hall’s seats at the forefront? Always reminding the Water Dragon Sect’s past leaders that the ancestral hall is your territory? Are they just tenants? Have you lost your mind, Water Justice? Do you really think of yourself as the lord of the rivers and lakes, acting so arrogant and domineering?”

Li Yuan looked weak, “To add a crime, there are no words to argue against it. Just say whatever you want, I’ll accept it.”

Fire Dragon Real Man sneered, “Even the greatest incense offerings can’t withstand your spendthrift ways. The harmonious weather of the Water Dragon Cave Heaven is generally fine, what does it have to do with you? Isn’t Shen Lin the one working hard? Back then, when that sword immortal stole the treasures of the cave heaven’s water, why did you sit by and do nothing? Could he deceive the busy Shen Lin and the South Xun Water Palace, but not you, who’s always loitering around?”

Li Yuan pouted, “But the Water Dragon Sect hasn’t said anything.”

Fire Dragon Real Man knew there were many more complexities involved, it was not merely a matter of right or wrong. Yet in all matters of the world, one could still see the general outcome. And outcomes often served as the cause for the next cycle of karma. Just like those ripples on the lake; it’s not easy to see the vast waters, but each ripple’s rise and fall, as a cultivator, one should be able to perceive clearly, otherwise, what’s the point of cultivating?

The old real man said solemnly, “If it weren’t for my old ties with that person, do you think I would be willing to waste a word with you?”

Li Yuan sighed, no longer pretending to be foolish, his expression bleak, “I’ve watched the rise and fall of the Water Dragon Sect and the fluctuations of its incense offerings for many years, and I’ve seen too many hopes die. Now I feel it’s pointless. This generation’s sect master, Sun Jie, is decent, but what can be done? I’ve thought about refining the Jidu Temple within the Water Dragon Sect, but both of the two people I once valued couldn’t become the sect master. One was partly harmed by me and the Water Dragon Sect in partnership. The Water Dragon Sect has become my burden year after year; they brought this upon themselves.”

Fire Dragon Real Man seemed to be lamenting his misfortune and was angry at his lack of progress, “Stubborn and unyielding!”

On the mountain, painting the dragon’s eyes, nodding at the stubborn stone, playing music for a cow, communicating with a chicken, wasn’t that all knowledge?

The only difference was the immortals; they couldn’t engage in conversation at all.

Fire Dragon Real Man said, “Why not try being a decent human?”

Li Yuan, feeling humiliated and angry, retorted, “Fire Dragon Real Man, don’t bully me just because your Dao techniques are high!”

Fire Dragon Real Man pressed his palm on this young Water Justice’s head, cheerfully asking, “What’s wrong with bullying you?”

Li Yuan wanted to cry but had no tears, frowning, “Then I’ll heed your advice and behave like a good person.”

Fire Dragon Real Man lightly slapped him, sending Li Yuan tumbling into a deep pit at the bottom of the lake, laughing, “You remember the beatings but forget the lessons.”

Li Yuan lay at the bottom of the pit, playing dead.

Fire Dragon Real Man floated down into the pit, speaking solemnly, “Don’t really think of yourself as a high and mighty deity.”

Li Yuan opened his eyes, “If I’m caught between two extremes, wouldn’t that be even more distressing?”

Fire Dragon Real Man shook his head, “Self-righteousness is indeed hard to teach.”

Li Yuan rested his hands behind his head, looking woodenly, “I’m just a frog at the bottom of a well, unable to see the sky.”

Fire Dragon Real Man had quietly left without him noticing.

Li Yuan sighed, feeling he had taken a slap for nothing.

Fire Dragon Real Man slowly walked into the Fushui Island residence.

Chen Ping'an had already woken up, watching Zhang Shanfeng practice martial arts in the courtyard.

Upon seeing the old real man, Chen Ping'an was about to pay his respects, but Fire Dragon Real Man waved his hand, “Tired or not, as long as your heart is in it, I have some insight. Go inside and take a look at your third innate item. If there are no flaws, you should refine it soon. You can ponder as much as you like while climbing the mountain; that’s fine, but it doesn’t mean you should take your time. Also, moving slowly doesn’t mean you can actually dawdle. Chen Ping'an, you need to clearly differentiate between the two.”

Chen Ping'an silently noted this in his heart.

Zhang Shanfeng stopped his martial arts, and the three of them entered the house together.

Chen Ping'an carefully took out the fragments of wooden statues dedicated to the mountain top Daoist temple.

Fire Dragon Real Man waved his sleeve, and a layer of greenish gas rippled into a surface that looked like jade, smooth and bright as a mirror.

Chen Ping'an also took out the thirty-six blue bricks that paved the ground of the Daoist temple.

One hundred and twenty-two pieces of emerald green glazed tiles.

And a large bunch of bamboo branches and leaves he had gathered from that green bamboo.

Fire Dragon Real Man asked, “Have you accumulated these possessions after visiting many cave heavens and blessed lands?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “They were all found in one place.”

He felt embarrassed to say he had “picked them up.”

Fire Dragon Real Man looked at him oddly, “Are you a bandit?”

Chen Ping'an was about to pull out several other treasures from the mountain but had to withdraw his hand.

The lady’s round fan bought from “Daoist Sun,” and a pair of Dragon King baskets. There was also an ancient mirror gifted by Huang Shi, as well as the heart-shaped token of the Daoist gate, the jade bracelet with a reversed poem, and a tree gnarled pot.

He originally intended for the old real man to take a look and give an estimate.

Fire Dragon Real Man glanced at the pile of fragments without hastily revealing secrets, only pointing to those blue bricks, “The toughness of these bricks is comparable to the Dragon Slaying Platform that sword cultivators dream of. Because they have absorbed Daoist truths over many years, the essence of water contained within is merely superficial. If you choose to discard the blue bricks for the sake of the water essence, that would be a truly extravagant waste.”

Chen Ping'an looked at Zhang Shanfeng beside him.

Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “Whatever you want to give, keep it for yourself! The thirty-six celestial numbers are proof of your connection to the Dao. If even one is missing, it won’t work.”

The old real man pointed to a key acupoint on Chen Ping'an, “A person is a small universe. The celestial number corresponds to the four directions, taking the center of the four corners, which is my heart. The heavenly celestial number, the essence of yin and yang, is the true soil. The virtual and the real are both fundamental teachings of our Dao. Didn’t you refine the five-colored earth into the five elements as your innate item? Just right, you can properly refine these thirty-six blue bricks as the root of that mountain in your heart, which can also nourish the thoughts of the cultivator—killing two birds with one stone. However, refining this item requires consuming a large amount of spiritual energy; shaping the mountain root is no simple task. Later, I’ll teach you a mantra; dragon veins also differ between mountains and waters, and your method of refining items isn’t quite suitable for mountain-making.”

Fire Dragon Real Man picked up a piece of glazed tile, smiling, “Do you know how much this piece of glazed tile would be worth if sold to the right person?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

Fire Dragon Real Man extended a palm, shaking it slightly.

Chen Ping'an tentatively asked, “Ten Small Summer coins?”

Fire Dragon Real Man teased, “Ten Small Summer coins? Is it worth my shaking my hand?”

Zhang Shanfeng gently reminded, “Ten Grain Rain coins, Grain Rain coins!”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Would it have to be sold to the Glazed Pavilion in the White Emperor City of Middle Earth?”

Fire Dragon Real Man nodded, “Chatting with an intelligent person is indeed easier. For an ordinary cultivator, a piece of glazed tile is worth at most one Grain Rain coin. For those who don’t know any better, they wouldn’t even want to accept a few Small Summer coins because such items require accumulation to yield remarkable effects; otherwise, they’re just flashy gimmicks and not substantial.”

Chen Ping'an was fortunate he hadn’t sold his possessions at a low price; otherwise, if he were to learn the truth later, his Dao heart would surely be thrown into chaos again.

Fire Dragon Real Man picked a bamboo branch, smiling, “This is one of the ten ancestral bamboos from the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven’s green mountain god. You could call it a direct descendant. The bamboo is as sturdy as stone, thus able to become a tool, its virtue lies in its toughness. The bamboo stands straight, its joints advancing, humble as a valley, carrying literature and passing it down through generations; all of these are moral qualities. What do you think this particular bamboo you encountered represents? Why do you think you chanced upon it?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I can’t guess.”

Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “That’s exactly right.”

This was essentially Chen Ping'an’s introspection and subsequent refutation of many certainties.

If the inquiry for truth by a cultivator merely sought a dead heart, then what was the point of so many schools and disciples outside of Daoism? 

Ultimately, it didn’t matter what kind of bamboo one encountered. 

Chen Ping'an actually didn’t know where he stood.

Beside him, Zhang Shanfeng thought his master was right; if that was the case, it would be fine. 

Otherwise, if his master kept making things difficult for Chen Ping'an, it wouldn’t be good.

Fire Dragon Real Man suddenly said, “Shanfeng, go practice your martial arts in the yard.”

Zhang Shanfeng responded with an “oh” and, without asking why, stepped outside.

Fire Dragon Real Man reached out, and the fragments of wooden statues either flew or hovered, gently bumping against each other, swaying, and eventually reassembling into the likeness of a middle-aged Daoist.

It was like the remolding of a mountain and water deity’s golden body.

Looking at this “middle-aged Daoist,” Fire Dragon Real Man sighed gently.

Then he set aside his nostalgic thoughts, his expression serious, and solemnly asked, “Chen Ping'an, where did this deity statue come from?”

Chen Ping'an recounted his experience of visiting the mountain for treasure hunting in general.

He skipped over many details regarding Daoist Sun’s deeds at the immortal estate ruins.

However, Chen Ping'an still underestimated Fire Dragon Real Man’s knowledge and Dao techniques.

Fire Dragon Real Man gazed at the wooden deity statue and slowly said, “This person was killed by Daoist Lao Er while wearing Daoist robes and wielding a celestial sword. Among his direct disciples, there was one named Song Maolu, a prodigy beyond compare, who gathered nearly sixty percent of the Daoist forces outside Baiyu Jing with his own strength. Imagine what it would be like in our Haoran World if someone could contend with half of Confucianism?”

Chen Ping'an couldn’t imagine it.

Fire Dragon Real Man continued revealing the secrets of other realms, at his level, especially with merits to his name, casually calling out the names of sages and wise men, no longer concerned about taboos. He continued, “As for this deity statue, it’s not the kind of ordinary statue worshipped in various small Daoist temples. It’s an important divine seat second only to this sect’s main image, which you can understand as the Yang Spirit of a cultivator. This wood is refined from the ancestral peach trees planted in Xuandu Temple.”

Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “And the temple master of Xuandu is the senior brother of this figure, continuously listed among the top ten in the entire Qingming World, hailed as the fifth person who cannot be shaken. The lineage of Daoist sword immortals can be said to be supported by this temple master.”

At this point, Fire Dragon Real Man asked, “Can you be sure there are no hidden dangers?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’m certain!”

Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “What a good fellow, you’ve struck it rich.”

If an ordinary junior dared to speak such words, Fire Dragon Real Man would truly advise them to think twice. 

But since it was Chen Ping'an, he let it pass.

Moreover, since that Daoist Sun, who ascended back to the Qingming World, was willing to leave behind this item, it itself was an acknowledgment of Chen Ping'an.

Fire Dragon Real Man paused for a moment, glanced at Chen Ping'an, and at that moment, it seemed he understood something, vaguely guessing Qi Jingchun’s good intentions, though he wasn’t sure if he was correct.

Fire Dragon Real Man asked straightforwardly, “Do you have the rare materials prepared for refining the five elements innate items?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I do.”

Fire Dragon Real Man nodded, “That’s enough, no need to overdo it.”

Chen Ping'an felt a weight lifted off his shoulders. After all, opportunities only come once. It wasn’t like Cui Dongshan, who prepared three portions of five-colored earth, originally intending to pursue a stable outcome—timing, location, and harmony must all align before starting the refinement. This hesitation was also the reason Chen Ping'an had pondered whether to refine this item upon arriving at the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven.

Fire Dragon Real Man watched this young man who liked to think things through, chuckling.

If it were a mountain and forest cultivator, they would have hurriedly refined it as soon as they got their hands on it.

If it were a lineage-based immortal master, their seniors would have helped strategize, perhaps even more than the disciples themselves would care.

Fire Dragon Real Man reminded, “Before refining, calm your mind first.”

He jokingly added, “Do you have any other treasures? Bring them out for a look?”

Chen Ping'an didn’t hold back, taking out item after item from his storage.

Eventually, he even brought out a page of scripture and a Buddhist scripture.

Upon seeing that page of scripture, Fire Dragon Real Man seemed to understand something.

Fire Dragon Real Man helped evaluate the treasures from the mountain, during which he picked up the exquisite round fan, gently shaking it as if dusting it off, and smiling while handing it back to Chen Ping'an, “Take another look.”

Chen Ping'an accepted the fan, still decorated with a lady holding a fan, but upon closer inspection, he noticed that on the small fan in the lady's hand, there was another depiction of the lady holding a fan, and within that image, there was yet another image. Moments later, Chen Ping'an quickly closed his eyes, clenched his fist, and gently pressed it against his forehead.

Fire Dragon Real Man laughed, “Put it away, cherish it well.”

Fire Dragon Real Man tucked the pair of bamboo Dragon King baskets into his sleeve, “They’re too worn out. I’ll help you repair them. This isn’t just a matter of a few divine coins; only by blending water and fire carefully can they be restored without damaging the essence. You’d best not sell these small baskets; if there’s ever a heavy flood on your own mountain, they can be used for the flood dragon. Remember, the Dragon King baskets, besides being used for suppression, are also miniature dragon palaces in the world; when cultivators use them, they serve as weapons, and if flood dragons dwell within, they become natural water residences.”

Chen Ping'an thanked him.

After Chen Ping'an put away all the items, Fire Dragon Real Man seemed to hesitate, wanting to say something but holding back.

Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “It shouldn’t be personal matters; I understand. You’re curious about the customs of Padi Peak, right?”

Chen Ping'an gritted his teeth, saying, “Old Real Man, I dare to say, can I teach Zhang Shanfeng some profound Dao techniques?”

Fire Dragon Real Man laughed heartily.

If the realm of cultivators is the most tangible divine coin in the world, then the policies of Fire Dragon Real Man’s Padi Peak precisely do not allow any disciple to discuss matters based on their level of achievement.

The reason for this is not something outsiders should know.

But this young man, at least, was not considered an outsider.

So Fire Dragon Real Man teasingly asked, “Isn’t it strange that I intentionally hide things from Shanfeng?”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Fire Dragon Real Man turned and walked near the sword immortal hanging on the wall, smiling, “I only select disciples based on their character, not their aptitude. Who says a mountain must contend for those so-called geniuses for its foundation? A stable mountain with many conscientious men of the lower five realms, versus a reckless one of the upper five realms—who’s superior?”

Fire Dragon Real Man withdrew his gaze; it was a good sword, but it was also in conflict.

No wonder it’s Chen Ping'an.

Fire Dragon Real Man turned and smiled, “It’s not because I’ve reached this realm that I can say such things. It’s because I’ve always acted this way, steadfast in pursuing the Dao, cultivating strength and heart, that I’ve achieved the realm I have today. Do you understand?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Of course.”

Fire Dragon Real Man said, “It’s like I’ve planted a large tree on Padi Peak, producing many branches that bloom and bear fruit in different ways, some high, some low, some earlier, some later.

Some are limited by aptitude, with branches and leaves falling, like many older brothers who ascended the mountain for cultivation before Zhang Shanfeng, who couldn’t break through their bottlenecks and passed away. Some disciples are indeed naturally more suited for cultivation, and their years are longer; their Dao techniques are even higher. For instance, the mountains of Tai Xia, Peach Mountain, Zhi Xuan, and Baiyun—these mountains don’t mean the disciples have reached a higher realm.

The level of Dao techniques doesn’t depend on fists but on the heart of the person. However, it is indeed easier to talk about reason when the Dao techniques are high; the same principles would seem more reasonable. Padi Peak has always tried to avoid the spread of such situations. In my eyes, many disciples who have already passed away are no less than the upper five realms of Baiyun’s lineage; their every word and deed remains in my heart.

Regardless of whether one practices on Padi Peak or goes out to establish their own mountain, I will follow their true nature; I will teach different Dao techniques. Some need to be scolded by their master to correct their path and avoid detours, while others need a push from their master to move faster and be bolder. Generally, though, cultivation depends on the individual after the master leads them in.

Zhang Shanfeng is different. I don’t intentionally teach him; ordinary masters would make their disciples aware. But the way I teach Shanfeng is the most natural; he must know it himself, without needing to know more. Is this selfish? It can be, or it may not be. Whether Zhang Shanfeng’s senior brothers see this is up to them. This is the Padi Peak of true cultivation.”

Fire Dragon Real Man laughed, “The way cultivators view realm, treasures, and opportunities is no different from how common folk view money, power, and fortune; fundamentally, there’s a difference. If cultivators wish to be genuine immortals on the mountain, they must have a different perspective, right? Tough fists, long lives, many techniques—does that make one a superior immortal? There are truly a lot of immortals in this world.”

Chen Ping'an carefully pondered the old real man’s words. 

Today’s words and reasoning from the old real man might become the rules that could be directly applied to the Ruined Mountain.

Fire Dragon Real Man said, “Once you gain higher cultivation, and your reputation grows, naturally, you will encounter more and more outsiders pointing fingers at you, trying to teach you how to be Chen Ping'an.”

The old real man smiled, “So you must remember, people today speak of the ancients, the living speak of the dead; it’s merely bullying the other side for not opening their mouth. Therefore, first, Chen Ping'an, don’t die. Furthermore, the true villains of this world actually love the existence of good people. Only fools continuously despise good people, complaining day and night that they haven’t done enough good deeds. These people can’t understand, can’t be taught, can’t change; their heads are filled with mush, and they’re full of resentment. In my view, they are the most formidable figures in this world, and I can’t do anything about them. 

People talk reason for many reasons, merely to argue for winning and losing, to feel good, thus preferring extremes. They fear that if they don’t do this, their reasoning won’t be sufficient or grand enough. Such people seem full of reasoning; in fact, they are the least reasonable. You must be careful of these clever ones. That’s why I genuinely admire the Confucian sage. When talking reason, right is right, good is good; reasoning isn’t fighting. It isn’t winning by knocking the other person down and forcing them to plead for mercy. It’s about connecting reason, benefiting each other in the end.”

Although Chen Ping'an had remained silent throughout, Fire Dragon Real Man already knew part of the answer to a certain conjecture.

That was enough.

What a long and profound intention spanning thousands of years.

It turned out one could also protect the Dao like this.

It seemed he had underestimated Qi Jingchun’s knowledge earlier.

Surely the lineage of the Confucian sage, each of them was fiercely protective of their own.

Thus, Fire Dragon Real Man said a profoundly meaningful phrase, “Chen Ping'an, sometimes, what you think you have completely lost is what you truly hold onto. Therefore, some disappointments you think are actually where others find hope.”

Finally, the old real man patted the young man’s shoulder, “Alright, seize the moment and refine your third innate item quickly! This treatment of me personally guarding your refinement, ordinary cultivators wouldn’t even dare to dream of it. Otherwise, how would a third realm Qi practitioner have the audacity to wander around?”

Chen Ping'an smiled wryly, “But you just said you don’t judge cultivators based on their realm.”

Fire Dragon Real Man laughed, “You, Chen Ping'an, are not a Padi Peak cultivator.”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “That’s reasonable.”

The old real man clicked his tongue, “You really aren’t good at flattery.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’m not good at speaking.”

Fire Dragon Real Man chuckled, “Being a scoundrel is also a way of being a good person without regrets.”

With Fire Dragon Real Man around, it would be hard for anything to happen on Fushui Island.

Chen Ping'an was currently in seclusion refining his third innate item.

Before this, Fire Dragon Real Man first taught him an ancient refining mantra named “Refining the Three Mountains,” allowing Chen Ping'an to refine the Daoist essence of those thirty-six blue bricks, solidifying the mountain shrine as the root vein of a mountain. In the end, this young man actually asked whether he could refine just the essence without refining the blue bricks themselves. Fire Dragon Real Man didn’t question further about what use the thirty-six blue bricks would have without their Daoist essence and water essence, simply saying he could.

Otherwise, once the wooden innate item was successfully refined, the spiritual aura would be immense; the movements from the water palace would be manageable, but since the mountain shrine was crafted from the five-colored earth of Baoping Continent, it would inevitably influence the spiritual aura. If the balance among the three items was lost from the start, without care, it would require Chen Ping'an to spend a lot of time, materials, and finances on repairs—Fire Dragon Real Man couldn’t afford to lose face over that.

Fire Dragon Real Man was truly a person at the peak of the mountain, observing Chen Ping'an’s current realm and situation with clarity.

In the water palace, whether it was the innate item of the water character seal or the wall painting that hadn’t yet been completed but already had a semblance of form, along with that small pond, there was no need to demand more.

Among the sons of heaven of the North Julu Continent, those with such a water palace formation were few and far between; moreover, it was crucial to look ahead to when Chen Ping'an could turn that pond into a deep well and eventually into a dragon pool.

As for Chen Ping'an’s innate mountain shrine, its material was relatively ordinary, yet it was no less than the ancestral hall of the sect. However, it excelled in longevity. Regardless, it could not compare to the water palace and the future wooden residence.

However, Chen Ping'an refining the Daoist essence of those thirty-six blue bricks and separating the water essence actually consumed a whole ten days.

If it had been one of his fellow disciples who opened their own mountains, three days would have sufficed.

Fire Dragon Real Man didn’t think it was a big deal; on the path of the Dao, some people walk quickly because they started early, but climbing mountains is more challenging at later stages. It’s inevitable to slow down as one progresses, which is why only those who burst through their limits at the beginning are considered geniuses. Those who reach the Earth Immortal stage don’t continue to charge forward as they did before. Even Li Liu is no exception; everyone will linger for a time at the Nascent Soul stage before slowing down after reaching the upper five realms.

However, there are a few, an extremely small number, who grow faster as they continue walking.

The former are the typical sons of heaven, the latter can make those sons of heaven happy for many years, only to suddenly find out they’re also ordinary.

Chen Ping'an was busy cultivating.

Zhang Shanfeng lounged around on Fushui Island, refining his Qi, practicing martial arts, and chatting with his master.

One rainy day, Zhang Shanfeng held his umbrella and strolled along the shore, encountering a boy poking his head out of the water, who asked him a perplexing question about whether he would cry and run back to tell his master if he punched him.

Zhang Shanfeng squatted by the water, inquiring about the punch’s weight.

That boy was also bored and began discussing the punch’s intensity with the young Daoist.

After their conversation, Water Justice Li Yuan felt hopeful.

In the end, however, the young Daoist directly said, “I think it’s better to ask my master first before deciding whether to take that punch.”

Li Yuan felt as if struck by a bolt from the blue; for the past few days, he had secretly observed this person, thinking that this little Daoist seemed quite silly. How could he be so unassuming?

Zhang Shanfeng couldn’t help but laugh, “I’m just joking with you. I’ve wandered around Fushui Island many times; it’s rare to chat with someone.”

Li Yuan, who had only shown his head, leaped out of the water, sitting cross-legged, hands on his knees, and asked, “Little Daoist, why do you have such a master, and yet your realm is still so lacking?”

Zhang Shanfeng smiled, “My master can’t replace his disciples in cultivation.”

He actually felt that this boy before him seemed to have some issues with his head.

Li Yuan shook his head, feeling pity for the little fool from Padi Peak, clicking his tongue, “Little Daoist, you really don’t know how to appreciate your luck. Your aptitude must not be great either; if it were someone else, they would have swiftly reached the Golden Core and Nascent Soul realms. Then they would cry and ask their master for some heavy treasures to carry with them, and every time they descended the mountain, wouldn’t they walk with everyone calling them ‘Grandpa’?”

Zhang Shanfeng smiled, “But it’s not that I’m a little Daoist from Padi Peak, just boasting here. With your temperament, you wouldn’t be able to become a Daoist from Padi Peak. However, everyone has their own fateful path. Just because you can’t become a Daoist from Padi Peak doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. I think you must be some water god from the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven, right? I’m quite envious of you; you were born with that water-dividing divine ability. I can’t do that; I can only follow my master to learn immortal techniques on the mountain, and I learn slower than each one.”

Li Yuan squinted with a sneer, “But I see you, little Daoist, don’t seem to be anxious at all?”

Zhang Shanfeng rolled his eyes, “If being anxious works, do you see me anxious? I know being anxious doesn’t help, so why bother?”

Li Yuan sighed, “Your old real man has taken on such a mundane disciple; he must be heartbroken.”

Zhang Shanfeng chuckled.

Li Yuan became more convinced that this guy was indeed a little fool.

Then Fire Dragon Real Man must be an old fool too?

Thinking of this, Li Yuan felt a bit relieved and laughed along with the young Daoist.

But soon, Li Yuan found himself unable to laugh anymore.

Fire Dragon Real Man stood beside Zhang Shanfeng, smiling.

Li Yuan stood up and said, “Congratulations, old real man, for taking on such an astonishing disciple. He’s not just one in ten thousand; the Dao is promising, indeed promising!”

This was likely what made Li Yuan more impressive than the sect master of the Water Dragon Sect, Sun Jie. 

Sun Jie, along with the Lord of Shenzhao and his colleague Shen Lin, who had the guts to say such things in front of Fire Dragon Real Man?

Fire Dragon Real Man said, “Go inform the islands of Baijia and Cangyan, and then greet the South Xun Water Palace. No matter what happens next, don’t be nervous.”

Since it was a serious matter.

As the Water Justice, Li Yuan stopped being playful, nodded, and transformed into streaks of golden light, disappearing. He didn’t want to show his face at Baijia and Cangyan Islands, so it would be simpler to let Shen Lin and the South Xun Water Palace clean up the mess.

As long as it didn’t involve the Jidu Temple and the incense of the cave heaven, Li Yuan couldn’t be bothered to meddle.

Zhang Shanfeng noticed that it had stopped raining on Fushui Island, so he put away his oiled paper umbrella and quietly said, “Master, I feel there’s something odd about Fushui Island; this rain comes and goes without any sign.”

Fire Dragon Real Man nodded, “Shanfeng, you’re quite observant and perceptive.”

Zhang Shanfeng smiled, “I learned it from Chen Ping'an.”

Fire Dragon Real Man asked with a smile, “Then what has Chen Ping'an learned from you?”

Zhang Shanfeng thought carefully, “Crying poor and hungry?”

Fire Dragon Real Man chuckled, “That’s not bad.”

Approximately a stick of incense later.

Zhang Shanfeng and Fire Dragon Real Man boarded the talisman boat leased from the Water Dragon Sect, heading toward the sea of clouds, looking down at Fushui Island from afar.

Zhang Shanfeng suddenly noticed a carriage leaping out from between the islands of Baijia and Cangyan, with a goddess standing in front, seemingly using divine power to harness the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, gathering it towards Fushui Island.

Zhang Shanfeng suddenly remarked, “If Chen Ping'an learns of this water goddess’s actions later, he’ll probably be grateful for a long time.”

Fire Dragon Real Man slowly said, “Heaven and earth give birth to all things to nurture humans; how one views heaven and earth is the great scholarship of a cultivator. It’s the same table of food; some people gorge themselves, some chew slowly, some express thanks and gratitude—that’s the good-hearted; some settle accounts and worry about owing even a copper coin—that’s us cultivators. Some people flip the table after eating, fearing others can also feast; those behind will call out for the strong, filled with reverence, and seek food elsewhere, imitating this behavior. They won’t overturn the table but will put down their chopsticks and curse before leaving, perhaps even spitting in the bowls and dishes on their way out. 

Some people, after standing up, tidy up the bowls and dishes, unwilling to leave immediately, helping to stabilize the shaky table and chairs. Those waiting to eat will complain and might even kick that person.”

Zhang Shanfeng felt a bit confused.

Fire Dragon Real Man sighed, “What disappoints Confucian sages the most is always the scholars. What tarnishes Daoist teachings are cultivators. What corrupts Buddhist teachings is always those who merely chant scriptures.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked, “What should we do?”

The old real man slowly said, “Restrain oneself. Seek truth. Self-liberation.”

Zhang Shanfeng, full of worry, softly asked, “How is Chen Ping'an doing?”

Fire Dragon Real Man considered for a moment, “Qi Jingchun’s teachings have never fallen to the ground.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked again, “Does Chen Ping'an know?”

Fire Dragon Real Man shook his head, “He has never known.”

Zhang Shanfeng suddenly said, “I think this is how it should be.”

Fire Dragon Real Man was taken aback for a moment, focusing his gaze, shaking his head and laughing, “What a quaint wooden house in a small alley, seemingly appearing out of nowhere with a locust tree door. This is a bit unreasonable!”

The locust tree door was slightly ajar, and as one passed by, they seemed to hear faint cries.

Inside stood a peach tree, without any leaves or flowers.

Unbeknownst to when, those soft sobs, like a gentle knock on the heart, would gradually dissipate, and no one knew when the peach leaves and blossoms would meet.

It could be next spring.

Or it might take longer.

Outside the small alley stood a solitary young man in a blue robe, staring intently towards the not-so-distant alley, where a gleeful child was bouncing home, exclaiming that he would soon be able to eat candied hawthorns.

The Chen Ping'an who was no longer a child slowly reached out his hand as if greeting that child.

That carefree, innocent child paused, tilting his head to gaze at the adult.

In the end, it seemed the child didn’t recognize who the adult was.

Yet the child’s laughter faded, and without a sound, he quietly walked past the adult, entering the house and closing the half-open courtyard door.

Leaving only an adult self standing outside the door.

Eventually, that child seemed to grow a little, taller than before, becoming much darker. The child opened the door, stepping out of the house, carrying a large basket, filled with pots and bowls, a ceramic jar for boiling medicine, and tattered, faded spring couplets.

The child lowered his head, gripping the rope tightly that held the basket, swaying as he left the house and the alley, never to return home.

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 656: Reunion at the Estuary

The activity on Waterfowl Island (Fushui Dao) was quite intense.

It required the Water God, Shen Lin, to personally navigate the waters to reach Waterfowl Island. Fortunately, the cultivators from the White Armor (Bai Jia) and Azure Beard (Cang Ran) islands had received prior notice from the Southern Breath Water Palace (Nanxun Shuidian), informing them that a certain wild and free expert on Waterfowl Island was about to break through a vital barrier.

Two trusted attendants of the Water Goddess, one a lamp-lighting official from the Southern Breath Water Palace and the other a water vein examiner, were each staying as guests on the White Armor and Azure Beard islands. This was not only a matter of respect but also a form of "military oversight."

On the clouds above the sea, Zhang Shanfeng asked, “Master, how long has it been? Chen Ping'an has clearly succeeded in refining his life-bound object, so why hasn’t he come back to his senses yet?”

Real Master Huo Long replied, “It’s that simple to shut oneself away and think. Smart people who get stuck in a rut find it hard to get out. They either have to retrace their steps step by step or break through it forcefully, creating a new path.”

Li Yuan sat cross-legged at a distance, resting his chin on his hands, breathing in and out like a fish blowing bubbles. Even the revered Water Rites Master had become so bored that he had no one left to talk to.

Real Master Huo Long turned to Li Yuan and asked, “Old Li, still playing? Do you know what you’ve missed?”

Li Yuan replied, “I haven’t missed this excitement at all; I’ve been watching with my eyes wide open from start to finish.”

Real Master Huo Long chuckled, “It’s fortunate that the divine spirits don’t have such guts.”

Li Yuan rolled his eyes, “What, regret?”

Real Master Huo Long inquired, “Want me to sell you a bottle of regret medicine? Once this village is gone, there won’t be any more shops. You’d better think it over.”

Li Yuan’s eyes darted around; he figured this old fellow wasn’t just toying with him out of boredom. So he asked, “What’s the price?”

Real Master Huo Long laughed, “A bottle of top-quality Water Rites Pills, not the kind used to fool river gods.”

Li Yuan grinned and shook his head, “No thanks. Old Master, I really can’t take out a bottle of my life-bound pills. After all, even if I don’t manage things anymore, I still have to hand over one water pill to the Water Dragon Sect every ten years.”

This decade he would give one to Sun Jie, and next decade, one to Shao Jingzhi. The Northern and Southern sects would take turns receiving them. As for what was done with the water pill afterward—whether it was used as a favor to some shrewd guest or kept for himself to reward the direct disciples of the Patriarch Hall—Li Yuan wouldn’t pry.

Real Master Huo Long wasn’t talking about just one or two Water Rites Pills, but an entire bottle filled with rich incense and vital essence, at least nine pills.

If it were three to five hundred years ago, Li Yuan might have considered it.

But now, in his current pitiful state, he was no better off than Shen Lin, whose golden body was on the verge of collapse. The Southern Breath Water Palace was so shamelessly trying to add luster to Waterfowl Island. Was it really due to Shen Lin’s magnanimity? This woman was frugal and prudent; it was more likely she thought she had grasped a lifeline, treating Real Master Huo Long as a living bodhisattva to save her from disaster. It was all a matter of breaking something that was already broken.

Li Yuan shook his head, thinking to himself that when people speak of the mercilessness of the Great Dao, they are not just talking about the mountains but also about the heavens.

And that “Li Liu” was one of the few existences in the heavens.

To put it frankly, Shen Lin’s commotion would cost her several decades of time. Had she forgotten Real Master Huo Long’s original words? The Southern Breath Water Palace could simply watch from the sidelines.

Zhang Shanfeng looked puzzled.

Real Master Huo Long smiled and said, “Forcing a cow to drink water is hard.”

Zhang Shanfeng softly asked, “Has Chen Ping'an broken through?”

Real Master Huo Long shook his head, “Still at the third realm, but he’s at a bottleneck. For Chen Ping'an, his willow tendon realm can be considered a genuine ‘stay’ realm. There’s no way around it; he has faced the three major difficulties of breaking the heart demon, merging the Dao, and seeking truth early on, and with the Long Life Bridge now broken, it’s only right that he stumbles along. Otherwise, I’d have to suspect this kid is the reincarnation of some mountain-top figure.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked, “Isn’t it good to be a reincarnation of a celestial being after leaving the world? I’ve heard that many ancestral masters of sects leave a path back for themselves before closing the life-death barrier, seeking their reincarnated selves and paving the way for the continuation of their sect’s incense.”

Real Master Huo Long shook his head, “Not good. I am not my past self. If one can’t recall previous lives, that’s somewhat acceptable, but if they remember some things but not all, that’s a big problem.”

Of course, the natural-born Li Liu was an exception; for her, it was just a change of skin, effectively meaning she had never died.

Sleeping every night was merely a nap; it was death that was a deep sleep.

If a cultivator only seeks to evade death and forcibly seizes the heavenly secrets, it would be akin to sneaky thieves moving at night, reincarnating without their original soul, piecing together a person from fragments. In the end, who is who in that half-alive state?

However, Real Master Huo Long could understand some of the fears of the higher realm cultivators, even if he didn’t fully approve.

Some demonic sects that like to take alternative paths would even light a stick of life incense for their cultivators. Historically, many cultivators who merely stared at that stick of incense for a moment would have their Dao hearts collapse, completely falling into madness. This was simply a case of scaring oneself to death.

Real Master Huo Long seldom comforted his disciple’s thoughts and smiled, “Earlier, when I said Chen Ping'an was limping along, it was more about the muddled path of his heart, which has affected his true nature. In fact, a temporary low realm is not a big deal.”

Zhang Shanfeng remained worried, “Chen Ping'an owes so much debt; what should he do? This guy fears owing favors and money the most.”

Real Master Huo Long laughed, “Some big worries, Chen Ping'an actually doesn’t fear. For example, on the road to climbing a mountain, if he’s focused on walking slowly but discovers he can bend down to pick up money just a few steps ahead, even if it’s just a snowflake of money, do you think Chen Ping'an would walk faster? Each time he picks up a piece of money, a burden is lifted, and over time, he’ll naturally walk faster.”

Zhang Shanfeng suddenly understood; his master was really sharp, having seen Chen Ping'an just twice and understanding him so well.

Real Master Huo Long suddenly said, “With everything settled, we can return to Waterfowl Island now.”

Li Yuan finally couldn’t hold back and asked, “What realm is this Mr. Chen exactly?”

Real Master Huo Long and his disciple’s conversation was lost on Li Yuan.

The foremost fire law cultivator in the world. As for water law, he should be firmly within the top ten.

Let’s not forget that Real Master Huo Long was also the external Grand Master of Longhu Mountain. What kind of place was the Longhu Mountain Grand Master’s residence? The mountain cultivators have always revered worldly techniques, especially thunder law, as the most supreme. The heavenly pivot governs all laws. The Grand Master’s five thunder orthodox method of “creation lies in my hands” is the legitimate doctrine of thunder law throughout the world. Can Real Master Huo Long’s thunder law be weak?

Generally speaking, the various external Grand Masters of Longhu Mountain can study all forms of Longhu Mountain techniques except for the Grand Master seal and the immortal sword.

Thus, Real Master Huo Long could stand out in the sword-fighting-laden North Julu Continent, remaining so ethereal and unique.

Ignoring Li Yuan, Real Master Huo Long descended from the clouds with Zhang Shanfeng, arriving at the residence on Waterfowl Island.

Chen Ping'an had already exited his seclusion, his divine aura restrained and his skin glowing. However, having just refined his life-bound object, he had yet to stabilize his energy field, causing the spiritual energy within him to fluctuate, making him appear even more ethereal and detached. Once the wooden residence settled, this minor celestial quality would be easily controlled.

Real Master Huo Long nodded in appreciation, “When I was at the fifth realm, I didn’t have this kind of bearing.”

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists in thanks.

Real Master Huo Long didn’t mind Chen Ping'an's formalities this time; in the cultivation path, when guarding a barrier for someone in seclusion who successfully emerges, some surface formality is still required.

Real Master Huo Long said, “Since you’ve succeeded, my Dao and Shanfeng won’t linger much longer; there are still a lot of matters to attend to at the Flat Earth Peak.”

Zhang Shanfeng muttered, “Isn’t sleeping anywhere the same as sleeping?”

Real Master Huo Long wasn’t the least bit annoyed by his disciple’s mockery; instead, he laughed and explained, “Of course, it’s more comfortable to take a nap in your own grass hut.”

Cultivators occupy the world's famous mountains and rivers to distance themselves from mundane affairs for good reason. Immortals move into the mountains. The world is filled with troubles, and it’s hard to let go of attachments. Therefore, it is best to enter the famous mountains, as it purifies the body and mind.

Zhang Shanfeng nodded, “I do miss those senior brothers and nephews.”

Chen Ping'an said, “I might trouble the old master with one more thing.”

Zhang Shanfeng quickly replied, “Not troublesome at all.”

Real Master Huo Long smiled but said nothing.

Zhang Shanfeng was afraid his master would think he was being selfish, so he quickly said, “Master, Chen Ping'an knows his limits. If he says it’s troublesome, it shouldn’t be too much trouble. This is like us getting a favor for free. Before he returns to the Bottle of Treasure Continent, he’ll definitely come to visit our family. When the time comes, I’ll show him around, especially places like Peach Mountain and the vicinity of Tai Xia Peak, which I haven’t visited much. That’s just not right.”

Real Master Huo Long nodded, smiling at Chen Ping'an, “Go ahead.”

Chen Ping'an then expressed that he hoped to keep one of the 122 green glazed tiles for himself, while the rest could be sold in the City of the White Emperor in the Central Continent, for a total of six hundred Gu Yu coins.

Zhang Shanfeng was dumbfounded, about to speak, but was stopped by Chen Ping'an’s glance.

Real Master Huo Long seemed to weigh the pros and cons, smiling but saying nothing.

Chen Ping'an quietly waited for a response.

Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst.

The current situation on Ruined Mountain desperately needed divine coins; there were holes everywhere that needed filling, and none were small. 

Upgrading the Lotus Root Blessed Land to a middle blessed land was one thing, but it was of utmost importance. If not counting the proceeds from Wei Ban's third Mountain Water Spirit Night Feast, if he could sell that pile of glazed tiles, he could immediately earn six hundred Gu Yu coins, enough to close all the gaps and perhaps even have a surplus of about two hundred Gu Yu coins. He would send half of this surplus to Zhu Lian as savings for Ruined Mountain, to avoid being caught in a bind with every expense. 

As for the favors owed, since there was no choice, it was better to owe a great deal but ensure it was infrequent. This was far better than having to owe smaller favors to many people, which could never be returned, thus negating the essence of mutual aid and leaving friends feeling they had met with bad luck. In the end, the kindness in this world always requires a give and take.

Moreover, how could he continue to take advantage of Wei Ban? A dignified divine spirit of the Northern Sacred Mountain—was it appropriate to sweep the ground in his jurisdiction? After all, Chen Ping'an was a burden-carrying monk. Even if he had to run far with a well, wasn’t that something?

Chen Ping'an could keep a hundred Gu Yu coins for himself to purchase two or three imitation swords from the Sword Immortal Mountain. If the price were right, much lower than expected, perhaps he could buy a few more and give them as gifts.

Additionally, the construction and operation of the mountain protection formation on Ruined Mountain would be another considerable expense.

Including Gray Mist Mountain and Ao Bei Mountain, the selection and placement of the numerous new mountain peaks were third on the list. In fact, Jiang Shangzhen had initially come up with a pretext to thank Chen Ping'an for helping the True Realm Sect gain an additional Sword Immortal for their absent attendance at Wei Ban's two Night Feasts, but they already had three significant treasures. The Dragon King’s basket that Real Master Huo Long took for repairs also counted among them; the rest would need Ruined Mountain to continue financing.

Thus, Chen Ping'an could only keep two green glazed tiles for himself as a token. After all, this item was hard to come by, and keeping it on Ruined Mountain would serve as a good omen for double blessings.

Real Master Huo Long laughed, “Six hundred coins? At half price? Chen Ping'an, you’re making a bad deal.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “It depends on the person. If it were some wealthy merchant, I’d sell it to him for two thousand coins without batting an eye.”

According to Real Master Huo Long’s earlier appraisal, one hundred and twenty glazed tiles could fetch twelve hundred Gu Yu coins at the Glazed Pavilion in the City of the White Emperor.

However, some calculations aren’t that simple.

Accidentally picking up such a large pile of glazed tiles was a stroke of immense fortune. Otherwise, based on Chen Ping'an's own thoughts, factoring in Old Master Huan Yun's uncertainty about the price of the tiles, he would probably be overjoyed to sell each tile for a small summer coin, and he might even end up leaving behind the last two tiles.

Selling it at Flat Earth Peak for half price.

Such a choice would not only allow him to immediately obtain an unimaginably large amount of Gu Yu coins, but it would also serve as a token of gratitude for Real Master Huo Long’s guidance and protection. Furthermore, it would spare him the trouble of dealing with potential mishaps in trading with the Central Continent’s City of the White Emperor. Ultimately, Chen Ping'an hoped that before returning south, he could visit Flat Earth Peak and seek out Zhang Shanfeng, giving him a bit of confidence instead of being heavily indebted to the old master for a significant favor while still shamelessly mooching off his food and drink.

This plan contained both calculation and spontaneity.

Good intentions lay within, alongside numerous private thoughts, allowing Chen Ping'an to act openly without concern.

Real Master Huo Long said, “Hurry up and refine the scattered and chaotic spiritual energy within the three critical energy fields; otherwise, it will have to be returned to Waterfowl Island and Dragon Palace Cave, wasting Li Yuan and Shen Lin’s good intentions. It’s like when a host kindly offers a cup of tea, and the guest only takes a few sips before leaving—what’s that all about? That’s the first point.”

“Second, human efforts are limited. It’s impossible to gather all the spiritual energy; it’s unavoidable. After all, he’s just a third realm qi refining cultivator. You can’t truly drink tea to the point of bursting; the host sincerely entertains the guest and doesn’t wish to help the guest collect their corpse afterward; doesn’t that bring bad luck? So you should study the alchemical formulas for refining mountains and rivers and continue refining the Dao intent within the Daoist bricks; this is also a part of cultivation. Before this, you were in a treasure mountain but didn’t know it. These high-level alchemical formulas aren’t just for refining objects. Spend more time pondering them yourself.”

“The third point is the one hundred twenty glazed tiles. Six hundred Gu Yu coins is the price you set yourself; no buyer in the world will raise the price on their own. The impoverished Daoist is indeed famous for being broke in the North Julu Continent. Luckily, it shouldn’t be difficult to borrow a few hundred Gu Yu coins from disciples like Peach Mountain and Zhi Xuan.”

At this point, Real Master Huo Long smiled, “Rest assured, not a single Gu Yu coin will be shorted to you.”

Chen Ping'an once again bowed in thanks.

Zhang Shanfeng felt conflicted.

He was torn between realizing his master and senior brothers were so wealthy and that Chen Ping'an must be suffering a loss, which amounted to six hundred Gu Yu coins. Chen Ping'an wasn’t upset, but Zhang Shanfeng felt a pang in his heart. After all, their sect had earned six hundred Gu Yu coins. Isn’t this what people call “the fat water doesn’t flow to outsiders’ fields”?

So no matter what he said now—whether happy or not—it would seem suspicious.

Zhang Shanfeng felt a bit uncomfortable.

Life is hard.

Real Master Huo Long suddenly asked, “Chen Ping'an, what do you think of Zhang Shanfeng’s fist technique?”

Chen Ping'an was taken aback and honestly replied, “It’s a bit slow, not yet complete.”

Zhang Shanfeng felt embarrassed, nearly wanting to dig a hole to bury himself. Master, you don’t think Chen Ping'an’s talent is too good and are trying to inflate your disciple’s ego to save some face, do you? There’s no need for that.

He knew his own capabilities; Zhang Shanfeng had a good grasp of his own weight. No matter what he learned, it was all half-baked. Going down the mountain to travel and slay demons, he was still far from adequate. Therefore, Zhang Shanfeng had firmly decided to only descend the mountain once he could genuinely claim to have achieved some mastery in Dao techniques.

Furthermore, Zhi Xuan was the one with good talent. The little disciples from Flat Earth Peak loved to speculate on whether this Master Uncle Yuan was an immortal at the Golden Core level.

Real Master Huo Long said, “Chen Ping'an, your path into martial arts was indeed not a mistake.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Actually, it wasn’t my choice. Initially, there was no choice; if I didn’t rely on practicing martial arts to survive, I wouldn’t have made it far.”

Real Master Huo Long nodded, “No matter what, treating yourself well is the first step to treating others well. You must be clear about this. Afterward, when giving this world good deeds, ask yourself what your heart needs. For me, I feel it’s not really necessary.”

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment and smiled, “Understood.”

Real Master Huo Long remembered something and smiled, “Since you enjoy thinking so much and walking around Waterfowl Island, and you can even articulate ‘not yet complete,’ I’ll share a little story with you. After hearing it, whatever you think is what it is. There was a scholar who crossed a river with a boatman. The scholar, well-versed in literature, preached many great principles, making the boatman, who couldn’t read, blush with shame. Suddenly, a great wave overturned the boat, and both fell into the water. The drowning scholar could only rely on the boatman’s one skill, contemplating whether to save him or not.”

Chen Ping'an said, “I’ll remember that; I’ll think more about its deeper meaning.”

Real Master Huo Long seemed to smile and said slowly, “Is there really a need for deeper meaning? Just because I’m a Daoist with a certain status, you feel compelled to listen and think carefully.”

Chen Ping'an was about to say something.

Real Master Huo Long waved his hand, “I’m just a person on the shore; I don’t need to listen to the boatman’s answer.”

Finally, Real Master Huo Long waved his large sleeve, casually collecting the green glazed tiles into his robe. 

It is said that cultivators on the mountain can hold vast amounts in their sleeves.

Chen Ping'an felt a bit envious. With such mountain-level divine powers, being a burden-carrying monk would feel so natural.

Real Master Huo Long led the way to the bank, and the talisman boat quietly hovered at the ferry, floating with the water’s rise and fall.

Zhang Shanfeng and Chen Ping'an slowed their pace, walking side by side.

Chen Ping'an said, “I can only perceive a bit of meaning in your fist technique. After you reach Flat Earth Peak, make sure you don’t neglect practicing this fist technique alongside your other studies.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked with a smile, “Then do I count as your half-fist technique master?”

Chen Ping'an gave a single word: “Scram.”

Zhang Shanfeng softly said, “Don’t worry; I’ll urge Master Yuan from Zhi Xuan Peak to hurry over to Dragon Palace Cave. Although he’s skilled in Dao, his temperament is quite good.”

In front, Real Master Huo Long chuckled.

As for the disciple Yuan Lingdian, it was hard to say whether his temperament was good or not. In the past, this kid had been the most unruly, having earned his realm through sheer effort, but later he was confined by his master in the Peach Mountain stone cave for ten years. After emerging, he was then grounded for sixty years, which had significantly improved his character.

Chen Ping'an stood at the ferry, watching the talisman boat ascend into the sea of clouds.

He planned to take the initiative to visit the Southern Breath Water Palace to thank the Water Goddess. However, how to go would need to be first discussed with Li Yuan.

Li Yuan waited anxiously, and once the talisman boat finally left, he immediately appeared on Waterfowl Island.

Without Real Master Huo Long’s presence in Dragon Palace Cave, everything looked friendlier and more approachable.

Upon hearing that Chen Ping'an wished to go to the Southern Breath Water Palace, Li Yuan said it would be simple. He employed water law divine powers to take Chen Ping'an on a distant water journey.

He wasn’t petty enough to disallow this Mr. Chen from establishing a good relationship with Shen Lin.

Shen Lin had diligently maintained the operation of the Water Palace summer retreat for so many years; Li Yuan just acknowledged that he had been slightly lazy. Besides, they each had their own duties and wouldn’t overstep. In fact, Li Yuan’s intentional or unintentional “failure to be sociable” and his deliberate distance from the Water Dragon Sect’s leader, Sun Jie, had made the private friendship between the Southern Breath Water Palace and the Southern Sect’s Shao Jingzhi exceptionally precious, allowing Shao Jingzhi to feel grateful, even though she had entered the Jade Purity realm. Facing the Water Goddess Shen Lin, who was merely at the Nascent Soul realm, she still maintained a respectful demeanor as a junior.

Upon arriving at the summer retreat, they entered through the side door without obstruction.

Being the Water Rites Master still held considerable weight.

Moreover, the ladies of the Southern Breath Water Palace were familiar with Li Yuan, viewing him as a member of their own. 

Additionally, in this strictly regulated Southern Breath Water Palace, Li Yuan’s slightly risqué jokes were even more popular. Many qualified attendants and palace maids enjoyed listening to this seemingly youthful Water Rites Master recount tales of talented men and beautiful women from the mortal realm. When he struck the right chord, they would burst into laughter, and those with a bit of shyness would leave with a blush, murmuring a playful “disgusting” as they sauntered off, their slender waists swaying enticingly.

Walking in the familiar Water Palace, Li Yuan couldn’t help but lament that if he still had an unblemished golden body, he would truly be living the life of an immortal.

Shen Lin quickly came out to personally greet the two.

Li Yuan initially hadn’t intended to get involved; having led Chen Ping'an to meet Shen Lin would be a job well done, and he intended to find some of the ladies to chat, asking if they had taken a liking to any young talents from the Water Dragon Sect and whether he needed to play matchmaker to create some subtle encounters or misunderstandings. But that Mr. Chen, however, said he would only sit for a while before returning to Waterfowl Island. So, Li Yuan had to feel a bit guilty, putting aside those embarrassing stories he had recently heard for now. Over the past few centuries, he had told countless embellished tales about the mountains and valleys, yet it seemed the most popular ones were always about Jiang Shangzhen’s romantic escapades. It really was a matter of no justice in the world.

Chen Ping'an held a small tea cake made from Xuanbi tea in his hand; the gift was light, and the sentiment not heavy. It could only be described as humble.

There was no way; this visit, Chen Ping'an truly hadn’t prepared any suitable gift to show his gratitude.

However, Shen Lin was very happy, showing no signs of pretense. Upon hearing it was from the Cai Que Mansion’s Xuanbi, she even insisted on keeping Chen Ping'an and Li Yuan to brew tea in the pavilion beside the flower garden, telling Chen Gongzi not to mind, saying she would serve the gift to her guests.

This time, Shen Lin didn’t reveal her true appearance but instead used magic to conceal her scarred face.

As Chen Ping'an enjoyed the tea, he couldn’t help but feel emotional. This being was clearly a mountain and water spirit yet knew how to interact with people so well.

Shen Lin also had her own thoughts. This young cultivator, able to have Real Master Huo Long personally guarding him, just from his demeanor while drinking tea, suggested he surely came from a sect with a notable lineage or a family of wealth.

Chen Ping'an asked about the methods of refining water pills and how to reduce waste.

Shen Lin naturally wouldn’t hide any secrets, explaining many critical points, allowing Chen Ping'an to gain a lot. This was the difference made by having a wise mentor on the cultivation path.

Perhaps wild cultivators could also seize many opportunities from the immortal sect’s teachings, but the key to successfully utilizing those opportunities and treasures lay in the orderly inheritance and continuous lineage of the immortal family. Many subtle discrepancies, accumulated over time, could lead directly to discrepancies in realms, especially the significant difference between the Dragon Gate and Golden Core realms.

Throughout the conversation, Shen Lin didn’t ask a single question about Chen Ping'an's background, not even testing him.

After finishing the tea, Chen Ping'an took his leave and hurried back to Waterfowl Island.

It was still Li Yuan who personally escorted him.

Upon arriving at the residence on Waterfowl Island, Chen Ping'an sat on a mat and began to plan his next steps in cultivation.

Li Yuan returned to the Southern Breath Water Palace, where he bumped into Shen Lin, who hadn’t even tidied up the tea set in the pavilion.

Li Yuan actually didn’t enjoy drinking tea. However, since Shen Lin had brewed it again, he didn’t mind and leisurely sipped the tea. It was better than plain water, right?

After Real Master Huo Long’s arrival and departure, Shen Lin seemed to feel much lighter in mood.

The two chatted about some recent events on the North Julu Continent.

For instance, Ji Yue and Gu You had both perished together, Liu Jinglong from the Taihui Sword Sect had begun seclusion, and the female head of the Qingliang Sect had surprisingly found a Dao partner.

When Li Yuan mentioned that Sect Master He, Shen Lin, couldn’t help but pound her chest and exclaim how such a divine beauty should never fall into the hands of filthy men.

Shen Lin looked at Li Yuan, her expression a bit dazed.

She somewhat envied this Water Rites Master, who was idle all year round, frolicking in the mortal realm with a divine body.

On Waterfowl Island,

Chen Ping'an felt that from now on, he wouldn’t have a moment of idleness.

The Dao intent contained within the thirty-six green bricks had only just completed its first step, barely inviting the gods into the mountain and taking root in the mountain shrine. The next step of fully refining it into the mountain base was of utmost importance, otherwise, it would merely be a flower stand. However, the difficulty of refining Dao intent was even greater than peeling strands of water laws to transport to the water palace. This task consumed much more time; there were no shortcuts, only the slow and steady grinding of effort like dripping water through stone.

Chen Ping'an roughly estimated that completely refining the first green brick would take a full month, requiring at least six hours a day. Perhaps the refining of the remaining thirty-five bricks would become gradually faster, but at the very least, it would take two to three years of slow progress.

Moving the bricks up the mountain and transporting the water laws into the palace were long-term matters.

Fortunately, Chen Ping'an realized that he was practicing martial arts with some tendency toward mindless repetition, which allowed him to cultivate with reassurance under the identity of a qi refining cultivator.

In fact, he no longer needed to pursue a specific number of daily repetitions; as long as the intent of his fists flowed continuously, whether the bottleneck broke or not, he would allow things to happen naturally. As for whether he could reach the Golden Body realm as the strongest sixth realm, it wasn’t that he didn’t seek it, but he would no longer be overly demanding. If it came, it came; if it didn’t, then so be it. There was no need to practice the punching post relentlessly just to gain more martial fortune to present to Pei Qian. 

If he lost his way, how could he still teach the first disciple of the mountain?

When had he ever forced himself for martial fortune? Just because Pei Qian was your disciple, did he deserve such good fortune?

Moreover, Chen Ping'an had a vague feeling that after the martial fortune of Senior Gu You had dissipated, this strongest sixth realm would be difficult to attain. In truth, the gifts from Senior Gu and the martial fortune Chen Ping'an pursued were not necessarily connected, but the intricacies of life were hard to articulate. 

Furthermore, martial artists from the nine continents had their own opportunities and experiences, and Chen Ping'an wouldn’t dare to claim that he was the most pure.

The scene of the eighteen sword qi knocking on the last barrier was no longer something Chen Ping'an paid attention to.

The sharpening of the sword edge on the first and fifteenth day would eventually refine the two flying swords into life-bound objects, and there was no need to rush.

Next, while staying on Waterfowl Island, he still had to follow the old master’s advice and refine the abundant spiritual energy accumulated at the three critical energy points.

It was raining outside again.

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and then stood up from the mat, holding an umbrella as he stepped outside.

The mountains and waters remained the same, and there were still issues to self-reflect on regarding his mindset. However, Chen Ping'an felt that he had one good thing: as long as he no longer found himself in a state of confusion, taking the first step was still something he could endure.

Chen Ping'an strolled slowly in the rain.

One fundamental matter, once understood, opens the door to all methods.

Clearing the clouds and mist to see the blue sky, and the bright moon.

With many flaws in his heart, he just needed to mend them.

For instance, having the heart to do good but not being rewarded is still good; if not rewarded, what does it matter? If the good fortune that falls upon others is not considered good fortune, then if one truly has the heart to do good but cannot amend more mistakes or accumulate merit for those wronged spirits, he should continue seeking ways to correct his mistakes. Over these years of going up mountains and down rivers, how many paths weren’t walked out through experience?

Chen Ping'an had always upheld the principle that a gentleman gives favors without seeking recompense. Was it merely to deceive himself and others? Once the same principle fell upon himself, did it make him uncomfortable?

This kind of self-deception with deep selfishness, if allowed to spread, would indeed lead to deceiving and harming others. Eventually, the so-called principles piled up behind his back would only make him increasingly unaware of his ignorance.

He resolved his mental knots.

His mindset lightened, but his shoulders felt heavy.

However, Chen Ping'an felt nothing amiss. He didn’t wear straw sandals, yet he remained Chen Ping'an. Among all the impoverished households in the world, there was one thing that didn’t need to be said: enduring hardship.

Only by enduring hardship can one enjoy blessings.

Chen Ping'an walked a circuit around Waterfowl Island, returning to the residence to sit on the mat and began to forget himself while regulating his breath, slowly refining the spiritual energy that lingered in the wooden residence.

Heaven and earth’s spiritual energy were the greatest divine coins for cultivators.

It was just another way to earn a living.

While awaiting the arrival of Yuan Lingdian from Zhi Xuan Peak to Waterfowl Island, Chen Ping'an, in addition to his unwavering six hours of qi refining each day, certainly didn’t forget to draw talismans.

Chen Ping'an didn’t exhaust himself day and night to practice; it was just six hours.

On this day, a thin middle-aged Daoist arrived at Waterfowl Island, not taking the talisman boat but breaking through the sea of clouds, riding the wind.

The Daoist smiled as he looked toward Chen Ping'an, who had come out to greet him.

The Daoist bowed, “Yuan Lingdian from Zhi Xuan Peak, Zhang Shanfeng's fifth senior brother. You can call me Yuan Zhi Xuan.”

Chen Ping'an quickly clasped his fists in return, naturally not addressing him as Yuan Zhi Xuan but as Senior Yuan.

He led this ageless-looking, older yet skilled Daoist from Zhi Xuan Peak to the residence.

Zhang Shanfeng was unaware of the true background of his sect, but Chen Ping'an wanted to know more. Before traveling on the North Julu Continent, Wei Ban had briefly mentioned many interesting stories about Flat Earth Peak. There was nothing particularly hidden; those who cared to learn would find out.

Of course, ordinary immortal mountain peaks were hard to discern from the reports of mountains and waters.

Flat Earth Peak and those who could independently establish their own mountain and residence were not the type who enjoyed flaunting their cultivation.

The high-ranking figure beside him, Yuan Lingdian, was not the one with the highest realm among Real Master Huo Long's disciples, but he was universally recognized in North Julu Continent as a Daoist immortal who could be treated as an immortal at the Jade Purity level.

After Yuan Lingdian handed over six hundred Gu Yu coins to Chen Ping'an, he invited him to visit Flat Earth Peak and Zhi Xuan Peak, but there were no more polite exchanges.

It wasn’t that this Zhi Xuan Peak immortal looked down on Chen Ping'an, a third realm cultivator. It was just that there was nothing much to chat about between them.

So it was a brief visit.

Chen Ping'an saw Yuan Lingdian off to the island’s ferry.

Yuan Lingdian smiled, “Chen Gongzi, I must thank you for taking care of the mountain peak along the way.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Senior Yuan is being overly kind.”

“Overly kind or not, it doesn’t matter to me.” 

Yuan Lingdian smiled and took out a small peach wood box from his sleeve, “Inside is an imitation sword crafted by Hate Sword Mountain. Please don’t mind the gift being too light.”

Chen Ping'an was somewhat taken aback.

He accepted the gift without delay.

Wasn’t it foolish to pretend to be polite with these immortals?

Yuan Lingdian transformed into a rainbow and left.

Chen Ping'an stood there holding the peach wood box.

He thought that from now on, when purchasing imitation swords from Hate Sword Mountain, even if the price were high, he would need to buy a couple more.

Just in cash, Chen Ping'an now had over a hundred Gu Yu coins on hand, feeling quite confident.

As for the debts, he would let Zhu Lian worry about it alone for now.

As for the remaining five hundred Gu Yu coins, Chen Ping'an wasn’t worried about Li Yuan sending them to Ruined Mountain. He simply didn’t want to disturb too much; even asking someone for help should be done within reason.

So he would discuss it after reaching Lion Peak.

At the end of winter,

Chen Ping'an left Waterfowl Island.

He had already written a letter addressed to Lion Peak. He placed it on the desk, leaving behind that “Three Foot Sweet Rain” Chi Long pendant on top of the letter.

Initially, he planned to have the Water Goddess Shen Lin help deliver the letter and jade pendant. After consideration, he decided to ask Li Yuan for this third favor instead.

After all, some matters needed to be communicated fully and accurately.

As for that “Junqing Rain” pendant, of course, it needed to be returned to Li Yuan.

Li Yuan had initially refused to keep the “Three Foot Sweet Rain” jade pendant, expressing a long and righteous speech.

Chen Ping'an had to persuade Li Yuan, assuring him that if Miss Li became upset, he would be there to explain things clearly.

Only then did Li Yuan feel somewhat reassured.

He thought that since she was willing to refer to this young man as “Mr. Chen,” and this Chen Ping'an was willing to guarantee such, there shouldn’t be any major issues.

Chen Ping'an asked Li Yuan to say goodbye to the Southern Breath Water Palace on his behalf. Li Yuan, who had already taken on such a huge task, found this trivial matter even more manageable.

Li Yuan insisted on escorting Chen Ping'an to the bridge outside Dragon Palace Cave.

Chen Ping'an returned the “Rest” wooden plaque engraved with the characters and continued his journey to the great estuary.

He wore only a simple blue robe, carrying a bamboo box and a mountain walking staff.

His sword immortal and sword nurturing gourd were temporarily placed in the bamboo box.

Li Yuan still didn’t step down from the bridge, watching the young man venture westward.

Li Yuan returned to Waterfowl Island, not daring to touch the jade pendant but carefully and quickly extracting the letter and sending it off to Lion Peak.

A ten-day period passed.

Li Liu returned to Dragon Palace Cave, finding the nervous Water Rites Master Li Yuan, who astonishingly gave her a proper look and a smile, saying he had finally done something of worth.

Upon hearing this decree, Li Yuan nearly buckled at the knees, wanting to kneel to the ground. It was the first time he felt tears welling up in his eyes.

Li Liu took back the Chi Long jade pendant and casually tossed it to Li Yuan, instructing him to enshrine it in the shrine to help gather incense essence.

Li Yuan lay on the ground, trembling in gratitude.

However, Li Liu had already gone to the Southern Breath Water Palace.

When Shen Lin saw her, she remained prostrated, unable to rise.

Li Liu reached out and grasped, separating this Water Goddess’s golden body, then pressing down on the golden head. In an instant, countless fine cracks on the golden body began to mend one by one.

Li Liu’s wrist flicked, sending the golden body crashing back into Shen Lin’s skin.

Li Liu sat on the long bench in the pavilion.

Shen Lin remained prostrated, not daring to raise her head.

Li Liu said, “You’ve worked hard. If there are no major surprises, you will become the Water Source Master of the Water Rites.”

Shen Lin trembled as she responded, “This servant would never dare to have such extravagant hopes! Being able to continue guarding the Southern Breath Water Palace for a thousand years is already enough for me.”

Li Liu frowned, “Hmm?”

Shen Lin didn’t dare to disobey, immediately knocking her head heavily against the ground, “I accept the decree!”

Li Liu stood up, and in the blink of an eye, vanished without a trace.

Shen Lin remained kneeling, motionless for a long time.

Until Li Yuan swaggered into the summer retreat, arriving at the pavilion, Shen Lin finally slowly rose, as if from another world.

Li Yuan, with the “Three Foot Sweet Rain” jade pendant hanging from his waist, strutted in, chest out, walking with purpose, and winked at the seemingly dazed Water Goddess, pointing at the jade pendant on his waist with his finger.

“Look, what’s this?”

Shen Lin ignored Li Yuan’s gesture; she hesitated for a moment before plopping down on the bench again, still in a daze, murmuring, “Li Yuan, I might become the Water Source Master; do you believe me?”

Li Yuan seemed to have received a thunderbolt from Real Master Huo Long, staring blankly for a long time before suddenly burying his head in his hands, collapsing to the ground, flailing about, “Why isn’t it me? I could have been the Water Source Master, who hasn’t been around for thousands of years—why not the hardworking Li Yuan?”

Although Shen Lin had lost her composure when she mentioned this, she didn’t regret revealing this heavenly secret. Sooner or later, Water Rites Master Li Yuan would need to know, and rather than hiding it, it was better to be frank and straightforward to avoid causing greater distress later.

Otherwise, their mutual knots would only grow larger.

Li Yuan lay still as if he had become a corpse.

Shen Lin felt a bit helpless.

Li Yuan sniffled, finally showing a hint of life in his expression, and mumbled, “Congratulations, Mrs. Shen, on attaining the position of Water Source Master.”

Shen Lin smiled and said, “Next time you visit the Southern Breath Water Palace, don’t tease the attendants here.”

Li Yuan began kicking his legs again, loudly declaring, “Nope, absolutely not!”

Li Yuan completely quieted down and pitifully said, “I’m going to ask the old master for a large jar of regret medicine; I might as well eat myself to death!”

Shen Lin softly laughed, “The matter of Water Rites sealing has not been finalized yet.”

Li Yuan turned his head, rubbing his face against the ground, feeling aggrieved, “You just keep pouring salt into my wounds.”

Shen Lin stared blankly, grateful to Real Master Huo Long and appreciative of the courteous and polite young man.

Suddenly, Li Yuan jumped up, breaking through the heavenly curtain of Dragon Palace Cave and diving into the great estuary, chasing after the heartless Mr. Chen.

At the banks of the estuary,

Chen Ping'an was splashing water on his face.

Suddenly, a head popped up silently, causing Chen Ping'an to nearly punch out of reflex.

Seeing it was Li Yuan, he relaxed the sudden surge of martial intent and smiled, “What brings you here?”

Li Yuan reached the shore and smiled, “Mr. Chen, are you tired? Let me carry your bamboo box. I can also massage your shoulders and back.”

Chen Ping'an felt a bit of a chill run down his spine and smiled wryly, “What’s going on?”

Li Yuan squatted down, hugging Chen Ping'an’s leg and howling, “Mr. Chen, do you need water pills? If you do, I have two bottles here; they’re just a burden to me…”

Damn it! What’s with Li Da Ye throwing away his dignity? He was throwing it all away today!

Shen Lin could be the Water Source Master; the Water Rites could still have a Dragon Pavilion Marquis, even if the rank was a bit lower. However, the Dragon Pavilion Marquis wasn’t under the jurisdiction of the Water Source Master, only managing a water domain, slightly inferior to the Water Source Master, yet both could manage the Water Rites without interfering.

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to squat down helplessly and say, “If you keep this up, I’ll leave.”

Li Yuan released him, sitting on the ground, softly asking, “Mr. Chen, do you really not know who she is?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “You know I definitely don’t know. I only know that Miss Li is a fellow townsman and the sister of a certain troublemaker.”

In fact, Chen Ping'an still hadn’t figured out Li Yuan’s identity.

As for the status of the Southern Breath Water Palace within Dragon Palace Cave, Chen Ping'an didn’t want to delve deeply. He could only vaguely guess that the Madam Shen must have a special status among the many water spirits in Dragon Palace Cave, given that she managed a “water palace.”

Li Yuan didn’t dare to say much either.

Lest he end up losing something, even the Chi Long jade pendant that was already enshrined in the shrine.

Li Yuan felt a bit downcast.

Chen Ping'an could only sit down beside him, leaning against the bamboo box, softly saying, “How can I help? Just tell me. As long as it’s something I can agree to, I won’t be vague.”

Now it was Li Yuan’s turn to be at a loss for words.

In fact, this exceptional trip outside the Water Dragon Sect’s territory was merely about feeling a bit unsatisfied inside.

It wasn’t necessarily about striving for the title of Dragon Pavilion Marquis; he knew well that in life, those who pass by may cross paths, but missed opportunities can never be reclaimed.

However, Li Yuan couldn’t give up hope, feeling he could still struggle a bit. He blinked his eyes, trying to make his smile more sincere, and asked, “Mr. Chen, if I give you two bottles of water pills, will you accept them?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled and shook his head.

Li Yuan sulked, looking mournful, “I knew it.”

Chen Ping'an took out two jars of wine: one jar was purchased from the bridge, and the other was sweet rice wine.

Buying immortal wine from everywhere had become a habit for Chen Ping'an.

Li Yuan accepted the jar of evening wine and gulped it down heartily.

Chen Ping'an had not drunk any wine along the way, sipping the hometown rice wine in small sips, remaining quiet.

Li Yuan remembered something he had half-done earlier. He had felt it was too pretentious before, so he hadn’t completed the other half.

It was the “Rest” wooden plaque he had requested from the Water Dragon Sect. He had just never had the courage to give it to Chen Ping'an, fearing the other party would see it as a hidden agenda.

Now that he had drunk Chen Ping'an’s evening wine, he tossed the wooden plaque to him, smiling, “Consider it payment for the wine.”

Chen Ping'an accepted the wooden plaque, smiling, “Thank you.”

Li Yuan seemed to have given up hope and figured things out. He stood up, “I’m off to cry at home.”

Chen Ping'an stood up as well, clasping his fists, “Mountains high and waters long, we shall meet again.”

Li Yuan paused for a moment, nodded, and sniffled, “This return journey feels unclear, countless mountains and waters clash against the sky.”

Chen Ping'an was stunned for a moment. Was this a poetic duel? He felt confident that he could recite poems from books for an entire day and night without issue.

Li Yuan felt aggrieved, “What are you staring at?”

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine, thinking he might have been overthinking things.

Li Yuan leaped into the great estuary but didn’t sink underwater. Instead, he danced over the water’s surface, returning home, occasionally kicking a large fish into the air for a few meters before it dazedly plopped back into the water.

Chen Ping'an withdrew his gaze, amused by it. He began to look forward to the future when Chen Lingjun would also stroll over the great estuary with Li Yuan. They should get along quite well.

Chen Ping'an continued his journey along the estuary without any hiccups, occasionally encountering some small scenic spots.

Once, a large boat had anchored at the ferry for the night, and on the second floor, someone lit a lamp. Chen Ping'an saw a noblewoman remove her head and place it on the table, holding an ivory comb as she gently brushed her long hair.

Seeming to sense Chen Ping'an’s gaze, she tilted her body, allowing her head to look out the window. Upon seeing the young man in the blue robe, a hint of shyness appeared on her face. She set the comb down, returned her head to her neck, and bowed deeply to the young man on the shore, not daring to meet his gaze directly. Her hairpin tilted, body graceful, as she performed a full bow.

Chen Ping'an chuckled.

Upon hearing a baby cry, the woman hurriedly walked into the neighboring chamber.

Chen Ping'an continued on his way.

On that official ship, instead of a ghostly and oppressive atmosphere, there was instead a hint of literary elegance lingering about.

Passing through a riverside village, Chen Ping'an saw a simple-minded village child and gently patted him on the back. It seemed that in every rural settlement, there often existed such a pitiable soul.

That night, Chen Ping'an quietly burned incense in the village shrine, then stood by the courtyard all night, listening to some mundane “family matters”, doing small deeds, before leaving at dawn.

Another year passed with winter giving way to spring.

Unknowingly, Chen Ping'an had arrived at the mouth of the great estuary.

On that New Year’s Eve, he still camped outdoors.

At the estuary, there was a large city. Chen Ping'an stood in front of a shop, where a customer was asking the shopkeeper if the oranges were sweet. The shopkeeper smiled and replied, “If I say they’re not sweet, you’ll buy them, so they’re not sweet.”

Chen Ping'an thought it was quite bold for the shopkeeper to speak so firmly. He thus bought an extra pound of oranges, keeping one for himself while placing the rest in his bamboo box. He planned to head out of the city to enjoy the view of the great estuary flowing into the sea before heading to the ferry at Yinger Mountain to take a boat to Lion Peak.

Holding the orange, Chen Ping'an walked slowly through the streets when he suddenly stopped, turning to look down an alley.

In the alley was a female Daoist and a young man.

They were of similar ages but starkly different in social standing; one was the sect leader, while the other was the chief disciple of the sect.

The young man, initially bewildered by the leader's sudden change of route to this bustling city, finally understood the reason.

He was waiting for someone.

A shabby and downtrodden traveling scholar?

Chen Ping'an didn’t turn away but instead walked directly into the alley.

He Shuangliang smiled casually, “Long time no see, Chen Ping'an.”

Chen Ping'an paused at the alley's entrance, smiling, “The longer we don’t see each other, the better.”

The young man standing one step behind his sect leader squinted, not speaking, but a flash of murderous intent flickered and vanished.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Are you here specifically to find me again?”

He Shuangliang regarded him with a complex expression and shook her head, “Not specifically; I just happened to run into you and came to see how you’re doing.” 

The young man felt as if the world had crumbled beneath him; what killing intent could he harbor now? His Dao heart was nearly shattered.

In his mind, the seemingly divine sect leader, He Shuangliang, was someone he believed was just a step away from him, but in reality, there was an insurmountable chasm between them. He could never have any improper thoughts, especially since the sect leader didn’t even look kindly on Xu Xuan, so how could she treat any other man like this?

He Shuangliang looked at the young man in the blue robe before her, and for the first time, she felt a bit dazed.

In her memory, he should always be that dark-skinned boy wearing straw sandals, but now his eyes sparkled with brilliance, clear as a bottomless pool.

That wasn’t supposed to be the case with the person before her.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 657: A Visit with a Meal of Fists

Many years ago, the two had met once in one person’s hometown and the other’s foreign land. Now, the situation was much the same, only with their roles reversed. After all, Northern Ju Lu Continent was considered half a hometown for this founding master of the Qingliang Sect.

For the common folk at the foot of the mountain, recognizing their roots was of utmost importance. For the ascetic practitioners on the mountain, who were focused and detached from worldly desires, the matter held even greater significance.

He Xiaolian turned to her disciple, a direct and loyal follower of the sect, and said, “Li Zhou, you should head back to the mountain first.”

Although Li Zhou looked somewhat lost in thought, he promptly collected himself and respectfully took his leave.

He Xiaolian smiled and asked, “Just taking a stroll?”

Chen Ping’an nodded and replied, “It’s time for a good chat. There’s no need to beat around the bush; that’s not how a sect master should conduct herself.”

He Xiaolian walked into a narrow alley, deliberately stepping aside to lean against the wall, while Chen Ping’an walked on the opposite side.

He Xiaolian inquired, “In Ghostly Trick Valley, how did you figure out that Gao Cheng and I were plotting against you?”

Chen Ping’an answered, “It was a series of vague coincidences. I thought Sect Master He must have a higher understanding of the Dao and a more intricate mind, so I made a quick getaway.”

He Xiaolian said, “I was fine in my own territory, practicing my cultivation, yet I almost fell from my realm. How many sect masters, having just entered the Jade Pure realm, would face such a situation?”

Chen Ping’an recalled the experience he had while purchasing oranges earlier and chuckled, “If simply apologizing could allow me and Sect Master He to go our separate ways peacefully, then I would have been mistaken.”

He Xiaolian didn’t respond directly and changed the topic, saying, “You wouldn’t have said such things in the past.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “In the past, as long as I could survive, I’d even bow and plead for mercy.”

He Xiaolian remarked, “For instance, if you could, would you beg that the Mountain Ape does not severely injure Liu Xianyang?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Of course. If that old brute thought my humble bowing lacked sincerity, I’d strive to bow so deeply that I’d bloom a flower for him.”

He Xiaolian asked, “And what happens after the bowing?”

Chen Ping’an showed no hesitation, “What else could I do? Just live a plain and ordinary life. If by chance, I get an opportunity to settle old scores, then that’s a different story. The wine on the mountain only gets more fragrant with time.”

He Xiaolian pressed further, “And now?”

As they walked, Chen Ping’an tossed the orange in his hand lightly and said slowly, “With insufficient skills, I can only rely on drinking to fill the gaps. What else? Should I blame the heavens and wail, shouting that the heavens are blind, and expect them to respond?”

Just as He Xiaolian was about to ask another question, she wondered how things should be now compared to the past. Her master, Lu Chun, had taken her through a more complex timeline, allowing her to witness various futures of Chen Ping’an. 

Only the present Chen Ping’an was not among those “various Chen Ping’ans.”

“There’s no need for nostalgia,” Chen Ping’an said, grasping the orange and turning to smile, “Sect Master He, let’s be direct. In the future, can we truly walk our own paths, you on your sunny way, and I on my narrow bridge?”

He Xiaolian pointed to the sky, smiling, “Why not ask my master? If my master truly issues an edict, as the gatekeeper disciple, I wouldn’t dare disobey.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Then I’ll need to be stronger. I just don’t know how much more liquor I need to drink before that.”

Since the other party lacked sincerity, the conversation became increasingly difficult. He Xiaolian didn’t care much about what Chen Ping’an was thinking; her only concern was how he would proceed and whether he would become a significant hindrance on her path to greatness.

Recalling the past, that boy in straw sandals carrying a basket full of snake gallstones, their first meeting by the water was not merely a matter of status disparity but also reflected the boy’s spirit then, muddied by the road ahead.

Who would have thought that years later, despite the still significant gap in realms, his spirit had indeed risen considerably.

He Xiaolian said softly, “Chen Ping’an, do you realize that with your temperament, every time you climb a little higher, the more cautious and meticulous you become? Once your enemies catch a whiff of your intentions, their desire to kill you will only grow stronger.”

“Is this still my fault?” Chen Ping’an replied with a smile, “Then I must speak honestly to Sect Master He. Do you think that if I didn’t gradually rise, there wouldn’t be countless fingers ready to crush me? I believe there are many who either feel it’s not worth the risk or are simply training poorly, yearning for something unattainable. Just thinking about this, my good mood upon meeting Sect Master He after all these years only brightens.”

He Xiaolian seemed to casually remark, “You believe they are at fault first. Have you considered the possibility that you may not have done anything wrong, but you are simply a mistake?”

Chen Ping’an remained calm, “This kind of streetwise talk isn’t something that requires Sect Master He to say. For so many years, in my hometown near Mud Bottle Alley, not only have my peers made such remarks in jest, but there are also some bastards who deliberately bring it up to irritate me. Many elderly neighbors, many kind-hearted folks, sometimes when they look at me, they express similar sentiments.”

He Xiaolian was silent for a long time.

At the end of the alley, she stopped and said, “So you’ve known the truth all along.”

Chen Ping’an said, “What are you talking about, Sect Master He? I don’t quite understand.”

He Xiaolian smiled, “As long as you understand in your heart, that’s enough.”

Chen Ping’an retorted, “Enough?”

He Xiaolian smiled, “Not quite enough.”

It seemed she had suddenly realized a heart knot, and turning to face Chen Ping’an, she said, “I’ll be waiting for you at the peak of the Great Harmony world. Other than that, we should each walk our own paths.”

This reunion at the confluence of Jidu was both coincidental and inevitable. 

Whenever He Xiaolian aimed to achieve something, she often found it came to fruition. 

If one were to challenge her good fortune, they would simply have to endure.

Chen Ping’an received a better answer than he had expected and smiled, “Then I won’t see Sect Master He off.”

He Xiaolian smiled, “I never said I was leaving right away. As a sect master, burdened with worries, it’s rare to go out, and upon meeting someone I can’t let go of, shouldn’t I cherish it well?”

Chen Ping’an mentioned two names: “Xu Xuan, Li Zhou.”

He Xiaolian smiled brightly, “One keeps your hands in check, the other keeps your mouth busy, so you won’t be distracted.”

Chen Ping’an remained silent.

He Xiaolian feigned surprise, “What, is it still my fault?”

At that moment, Chen Ping’an genuinely considered punching her in the face.

He Xiaolian, with her “understanding,” said, “With insufficient skills, we can only drink to compensate. Do you have good wine? I have some of the best celestial brewing from Northern Ju Lu, I’ll give it to you.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “It would be a shame to kill Sect Master He with a punch. I’m just rambling, don’t be angry, Sect Master He.”

Even if he could kill her with one punch, it would take two.

He Xiaolian actually squinted and smiled, placing a hand gently on her mouth, shaking her head, “I’m not angry. You and I have formed a late-blooming sincere rapport, which is a good thing.”

As Chen Ping’an exited the alley, He Xiaolian, who had once again activated her illusion technique, walked alongside him. The distance between them was still not close enough to be considered walking side by side.

Chen Ping’an looked ahead at the bustling street, filled with people and vehicles, and asked, “When will you leave?”

He Xiaolian replied, “Probably a bit later than you think.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “He Xiaolian, have you always been this kind of person?”

He Xiaolian laughed, “Aren’t you the same? It’s just that I’ve known myself from the beginning while you, Chen Ping’an, came to know yourself much later, making it harder for you.”

The two left the city, walking along the river toward the western sea of Northern Ju Lu.

Chen Ping’an climbed onto a seaside platform and suddenly said, “He Xiaolian, the path you desperately seek is just like Ning Yao in my heart. Does that make sense?”

He Xiaolian nodded, “Of course it makes sense; what’s difficult about that? But the problem is, I don’t want to accept this outcome.”

Chen Ping’an gazed into the distance, falling silent.

After a moment of hesitation, He Xiaolian squatted down beside him and asked, “Since we passed by earlier, why not visit the academy?”

She had actually just left the academy not long ago.

Chen Ping’an tugged at the corner of his mouth, his hands clasped on his knees as his sleeves naturally drooped, “If Lu Chun died because of you, would you go to the Baiyu Capital and the Three Veins to see for yourself?”

He Xiaolian remained silent for a long time before slowly saying, “Chen Ping’an, it is only today that I realize becoming your Dao partner is not a hindrance for me at all. It turns out this is the best fate in the world.”

Chen Ping’an took off his bamboo box, took out the Sword Nourishing Gourd, sat cross-legged, and slowly drank. He inexplicably said, “The Dao shouldn’t be this trivial.”

He Xiaolian, for some reason, changed her mind. She stood up and left the place early, turning back before she left to say to Chen Ping’an, leaning against the bamboo box, “Romantic love between men and women is ultimately a small matter.”

Chen Ping’an replied indifferently, “This matter, don’t say it’s your master Lu Chun. Even if the Dao Ancestor said it, it wouldn’t count.”

He Xiaolian chuckled in disbelief and rode the wind away.

**Last Winter.**

After leaving the Long Palace Cave Heaven, Yu Lingdian traveled north, suddenly plummeting down to a remote mountain peak, not a celestial mountain but an ordinary secluded spot with common spiritual energy.

There, Yu Lingdian saw her master engaged in a game of chess with a woman, using casually refined mountain roots as black pieces and water as white pieces.

Yu Lingdian bowed to both of them and stood beside the Fire Dragon Real Man, not casting a glance at the game, fearing it would disrupt her Dao heart.

The valley below didn’t truly have the arts of the zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting, as they merely lingered on the word “technique.” 

Even among the various schools on the mountain, there were distinctions between upper, middle, and lower realms. The zither players and those who carved the zither were better off, since they had received the Sage’s judgment and were associated with merit. However, the calligraphers were the least respected, and those who painted looked down upon the calligraphers. The calligraphers, in turn, had to highlight the divine merit of the Sage’s creation of characters, arguing heatedly, as had been the case since ancient times.

The Fire Dragon Real Man picked up a piece and gently placed it on the intricately intertwined chessboard of Dao intent, asking, “Is it just a matter of sending a fake sword from Hate Sword Mountain?”

Yu Lingdian nodded, “Nothing more was done.”

Yu Lingdian understood her master’s intention, as she had been a pure martial artist in her early years, even reaching the distant realm through the strongest golden body. However, with her master’s guidance, she abandoned that gift, accumulating martial fortune for Northern Ju Lu. In the end, with great determination, she set aside martial arts and focused on seeking the Dao, facing hardships that surpassed the usual ascension to the fifth realm.

Yu Lingdian knew her master wanted her to guide the other party’s boxing techniques, but she was not very interested, nor did she think her instructions would be truly useful.

On the Ground Peak, unless the Fire Dragon Real Man explicitly stated what his disciples should think or do, the thoughts and actions of many disciples were free to roam.

The Fire Dragon Real Man said nothing. Although he had clearly lost the game, he suddenly laughed, “Seeking life in death is indeed a challenge.”

Li Liu remarked, “The chessboard is so small; if one is determined, they are quite literally seeking death.”

Li Liu casually shattered the mountain root water’s essence, returning it to the heavens and earth. The Fire Dragon Real Man also put away the Dao intent chessboard.

Only then did the Fire Dragon Real Man ask, “What did that letter from the Lion Peak that you intercepted say?”

Li Liu answered indirectly, “Just as you said, it was indeed sent by Water Zheng Li Yuan, not asking the Nanfeng Water Palace for help, nor not writing, but directly sending the message to Lion Peak.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “So since you have chosen this path, your burden is heavy. It’s not that others have only one lifetime; you, Li Liu, have accumulated so many lifetimes that you certainly know the most and the best. Good, losing the game outside the board has allowed me to regain some face.”

Li Liu didn’t care much about winning or losing the game; it was all the same to her. She had been through too much in life, and she didn’t really care about her current life. 

More importantly, it was just a journey through the mountains and waters.

Since Li Liu was born with knowledge, she naturally knew more than just worldly matters; she also understood the various human hearts through her observations.

In the world, the statues in temples were often gilded, and Elder Yang required these inmates to act contrary to their nature, first wrapping a layer of humanity around themselves, even if it was just for appearances, they had to truly experience the world.

However, Li Liu now had something genuinely important on her mind, such as the major battle for the Dao that had once turned the world upside down, which had once again begun to unfold. Occasionally, she would wish that the curtain would rise only to fall again, teaching that person a thorough defeat in this lifetime.

The Fire Dragon Real Man’s move in the Water Dragon Sect’s chess game was not merely about Chen Ping’an; it also had some intention regarding Shen Lin’s eventual success, for the Water Dragon Sect’s lord, Sun Jie, and a few words about Water Zheng Li Yuan.

In truth, the Fire Dragon Real Man was helping the three parties navigate their respective challenges, but he also hoped to convey some “words” to the current Li Liu through Li Yuan’s awakening.

After all, in matters of “being human,” even though Li Liu had lived for thousands of years, she remained a junior.

Unfortunately, Li Yuan could not grasp this, so the Fire Dragon Real Man was unwilling to intervene too much.

Yu Lingdian felt a sense of emotion.

Her master had actually already noticed the unusual martial fortune at the ancient battlefield in Golden Armored Continent. For Chen Ping’an, if he could obtain the martial fortune, winning the game would mean that he and that peerless female practitioner from the Central Plains would be in a very delicate position against each other.

Since there was an unintentional Cao Ci present, the situation became even more complicated.

If Cao Ci had not gone to that battlefield relic, the strongest female practitioner, Shi Zhaixi, might have already broken through smoothly, yet she could not attain the title of “strongest,” because of Chen Ping’an’s solid foundation in Northern Ju Lu, making his boxing intent heavier. However, after Cao Ci’s appearance, Shi Zhaixi’s fighting spirit surged, her competitive nature pushing her to elevate her martial arts ceiling, determined to use her strength in the sixth realm to land a single blow on Cao Ci, not willing to break through until she had done so. 

In contrast, Chen Ping’an initially had a higher martial arts ceiling than her, but of course, he had to stubbornly take his time breaking through.

It became a game where both sides were unaware of each other’s distant maneuvers.

The Fire Dragon Real Man only knew that Shi Zhaixi was at the ancient relic in Golden Armored Continent when the idol collapsed, and he had heard that Cao Ci had gone there as well.

Thus, he deduced the situation and patterns.

The Fire Dragon Real Man smiled, “If Shi Zhaixi were to wholeheartedly avoid thinking about the title of ‘strongest,’ it would be a remarkable demeanor. For ordinary martial artists, it might lead to a drop in spirit, but for her, it’s about seeking life in death, liberating her boxing intent. I believe this is precisely what Cao Ci wishes to see; that’s why she has not left the ruins, actively assisting Shi Zhaixi in sharpening her skills. Although Cao Ci is merely in the golden body realm, for the proud Shi Zhaixi, she is the best sharpening stone in the world. Otherwise, facing a formidable opponent in the summit realm would not yield the same result.”

Yu Lingdian nodded, “Shi Zhaixi’s true bottleneck before was not on her fists but rather in her heart.”

Then, Yu Lingdian smiled, “Actually, as long as Chen Ping’an is lucky enough to continue dragging things out and not break through before Shi Zhaixi reaches her limit, he can still become the strongest in the sixth realm, gaining a share of martial fortune.”

“The way I see it, it’s somewhat precarious.”

After the Fire Dragon Real Man concluded, he turned to look at this disciple, “I want you to send money to Fushui Island because I hope you can personally tell Chen Ping’an this fact. For martial artists, it’s more meaningful for family to speak among themselves than for an old master to discuss the profound truths of martial arts with a third realm practitioner. I originally wanted to see if Chen Ping’an would show any signs of slowing down for the sake of that martial fortune, or if he would employ a different method of seeking life in death that is in tune with the Dao. Chen Ping’an, having honed his fists to death, is not due to laziness; engaging in fierce battles is also quite right. Clearly, he can comfort himself with the saying ‘human strength has limits,’ but why must he insist on punching through a dead end, forcing a way out based on his spirit?”

However, the old master shook his head, knowing it was impossible unless that kid came to understand on his own and quietly passed through a small threshold to have a chance to succeed.

Yu Lingdian wore a bitter smile, feeling somewhat guilty, “It’s the disciple who has delayed the master. Should I return to the Long Palace Cave now?”

The Fire Dragon Real Man laughed, “Forget it; all things and methods should follow their natural course. Do you think just saying this is necessarily a good thing? Do you think Chen Ping’an can surely grasp the title of the strongest? Do you think on the path of the heart, every effort will go without consequences? If a person never accepts their fate, thinking that pursuing the extreme is good, they may end up dead on the path of cultivation. Competing for the strongest in the sixth realm, if they attain the seventh realm, the eighth should be mine; if the eighth is mine, who dares compete for the ninth? Shouldn’t that person die? Isn’t that the battle of the Dao? Along the way, it’s just the rage of an ordinary person gnashing their teeth. When did martial arts become so trivial?”

Li Liu shook her head, “That reasoning is too extreme.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man also shook his head, “A pure-hearted person should promptly eradicate extreme thoughts.”

This point of reasoning left no doubt for Yu Lingdian.

Cao Ci did very well, on the martial path, she had her own way, yet she wouldn’t obstruct others from rising; if given the chance, she would lend a helping hand, just like assisting Shi Zhaixi in honing her realm.

This was also one of the reasons why Cao Ci could be “invulnerable” in the Central Plains.

Not only was her master, the Valkyrie Pei Bei, protecting Cao Ci from unexpected attacks by higher realm practitioners, but if the previously annihilated dynasty were to seek revenge, there would be more than just one or two high realm practitioners. 

Killing Pei Bei might be wishful thinking, but killing her disciple Cao Ci, who was wandering across the continent, wouldn’t be too difficult, there was at least a chance.

Cao Ci’s thoughts, actions, and behaviors were her greatest protection. For instance, this time, she traveled to Golden Armored Continent with her friend Liu Youzhou, who was willing to weigh Cao Ci’s life against the value of the treasures, which seemed to be a choice made after weighing the pros and cons. In essence, it was still Cao Ci’s decision.

In the Central Plains, the truly pure martial artists were mostly willing to extend varying degrees of goodwill toward Cao Ci; they might casually speak well of this junior during idle talks, and perhaps even personally intervene to eliminate some ripples of crisis.

How to turn bad into good is a skill, and to increase good even further is a capability.

The true observer of all things is not the eyes, but the human heart.

When looking at Cao Ci, they only saw her unprecedented talent and the fact that her master, Pei Bei, stood behind her.

That’s why eyes can be so useful, while hearts close the door.

Li Liu had probably gotten used to sparring with the Fire Dragon Real Man, smiling, “These principles won’t apply to many.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man laughed heartily, “Let’s discuss matters as they are, judging people as they are, not discarding all matters based on individuals, nor dismissing an entire person based on a single matter. Right and wrong, good and bad, will no longer be a muddled mess.”

Li Liu said, “That’s difficult.”

Yu Lingdian nodded, “Master is right.”

If not helping the master, should they help outsiders?

Moreover, Yu Lingdian truly believed her master was more reasonable.

Eventually, the Fire Dragon Real Man asked, “Then I must ask you, what do you think about Cao Ci and our Northern Ju Lu’s current top youth? When and where will their introspective battle take place?”

In her heart, Yu Lingdian was accustomed to speaking in terms of “strength.” After so many years of cultivating her heart and nature, it was still not entirely complete, hence she remained stuck at the bottleneck of the Jade Pure realm. This didn’t mean she was arrogant or domineering; the Ground Peak must have its Dao and reasoning, and Yu Lingdian had not been lacking in that regard. In fact, in terms of experience, she was the most respected among her peers on the mountain, but she was also the one most often punished by the Fire Dragon Real Man.

After a moment of thought, Yu Lingdian smiled and said, “Naturally, it’s when the unprecedented Cao Ci meets those who come after her, standing beside or not too far behind her. Moreover, the later contenders may have the opportunity to surpass Cao Ci, and that moment will be the key to revealing her true heart. As for Lin Su, who wins unconditionally by choosing to strike, when will she experience a genuine defeat and suffer the trials that follow?”

The Fire Dragon Real Man nodded, seemingly approving of these two answers, then asked, “And you, Lingdian, why can’t you break through? Is there any other Daoist practitioner in the world who has attained immortal cultivation yet is still at the Jade Pure realm? I’m looking around, and I can hardly find a few.”

Yu Lingdian replied, “Naturally, it’s because I have enough strength but not enough heart.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man chuckled, “It’s because in your early cultivation, your strength was too great, and you thought too little. Breaking through too quickly seems to leave you with the least understanding of the true meaning behind the Dao compared to your seniors from Taixia and Baiyun. Or perhaps you were punished too harshly by me later on, feeling that even if you had done nothing wrong, you simply hadn’t thought it through, leading you to ponder and reflect on where you went wrong. Once you understand, that will be when you break through.”

Yu Lingdian nodded in acknowledgment, “That’s indeed the case.”

“Have you considered the possibility that you’re mistaking a lack of fault for a fault? Are you stuck at a crossroads?”

The Fire Dragon Real Man sighed, “Fool! When it comes to teaching the Dao, does it mean that the master can only help the disciple find a shortcut? Isn’t it allowed for a master to set up various barriers along the way, making the path difficult to traverse, so that the disciple’s heart in seeking the Dao can be more steadfast?”

Yu Lingdian, for the first time, looked somewhat aggrieved, “Master’s Dao is so lofty, and the knowledge is so vast, I don’t wish to question even a bit.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man pointed at this disciple of the Zhi Xuan Peak and angrily said, “Ask that young man from Fushui Island if he, at such a young age, has ever thought that even the most respected Qi Jingchun is not necessarily right about everything?! Ask him if he dares to think like this! Does he dare to seriously consider the principles from outside the lineage of the Sage, not fearing to overshadow the oldest principles?!”

“Lingdian, if you only think that all principles in the world lie with your master, and that you can only learn to walk in a haphazard manner, then how many principles will remain when the disciples pass down their teachings? If you, Yu Lingdian, don’t dare to think this way after laboring for six hundred years, does that mean you only gain strength without gaining a heart for the Dao?! How can the Ground Peak, which requires effort akin to transporting mountains or chopping wood, only have you, Yu Lingdian, with this physique?!”

Yu Lingdian cast a sidelong glance at her master’s slightly swaying sleeves and cautiously said, “Master, please don’t be angry, let’s talk this through.”

Li Liu interjected, “Yu Zhi Xuan said ‘not willing,’ not ‘afraid.’ Don’t just focus on your reasoning, Master, and wrong Yu Zhi Xuan.”

Yu Lingdian almost felt like her heart was about to burst from anger; she did not need Li Liu’s help right now.

She knew her master’s temperament very well. After all, Yu Lingdian had received the most beatings among all disciples, and she claimed to be second among the Ground Peak, with no one daring to claim the first.

“‘Not willing’ is worse than ‘afraid!’ Afraid means you’ve at least thought it through but simply haven’t taken the step out.”

As expected, the Fire Dragon Real Man’s anger surged, and he ultimately coldly stated, “Go to the Peach Mountain Caves for ten years of closed-door training; think it through before you come out!”

Yu Lingdian remained silent for a moment, then sighed internally. Ten years was nothing; a nap, closing her eyes and opening them again, would soon pass. But it was the loss of face that stung. After her master’s return from this journey, only she would need to roll up her bedding and go to the Peach Mountain Caves for confinement. Meanwhile, the two seniors, Baiyun and Peach Mountain, would probably come to the cave often, leisurely brewing tea and chatting, even asking if she was thirsty.

Yu Lingdian suddenly had a bright idea and gently said, “Master, the disciples agreed to go down the mountain together at some point to help him fulfill a wish.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man no longer maintained a stern expression but smiled gently, “Although it was your fault, you must not harbor a competitive spirit against yourself. If you have a senior brother to assist, never hesitate. On the surface, admit that your personal little world is not as vast as the outside world, yet in reality, the human heart does not lose to the heavens. This is the pure intention that a cultivator should possess. Good, good. In that case, Lingdian, you need not go to the Peach Mountain Caves; stay by the mountain and help your junior brother protect the Dao for a while, but remember, do not reveal your identity and just travel around the foot of the mountain.”

Yu Lingdian bowed, “Master, rest assured.”

Oh dear, now it should be Zhang Shan Peak and Peach Mountain who envied her.

Yu Lingdian feared her master would change his mind and retract his promise, so she immediately transformed into a rainbow and dashed away.

Li Liu said, “Yu Zhi Xuan has figured it out. After going down the mountain, the day she returns to the mountain will likely be when she breaks through.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man nodded, “So whether or not she goes to the Peach Mountain Caves to face the wall is of no consequence.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man aimed to use the reasoning most acceptable to Yu Lingdian to gently guide and enlighten her.

Otherwise, as a master imparting knowledge to disciples, it was possible to guide from the pinnacle of ascension to the Jade Pure realm, but it would be of limited use and fraught with risks.

Reasoning is not as simple as a few words; it’s when the listener truly opens their heart after hearing them, thinking more beyond the words of others, ultimately achieving a harmony of the Dao.

Li Liu smiled, “Yu Zhi Xuan is quite perceptive; if you don’t deliberately restrain her heart, she may very well reach the Ascension realm sooner.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man sighed, “There’s no other way; this kid’s innate character is too capricious, and it’s necessary to hold him back a bit. Otherwise, the Ground Peak would attract unwanted attention; that’s a minor issue. Once Yu Lingdian breaks through too quickly, aside from her own heart not being fully ripe, the remaining senior brothers might inadvertently damage their own Dao hearts, and this is a major concern. One Fire Dragon Real Man is already a mountain pressing down on one’s heart; adding another Yu Zhi Xuan, even a person would feel the burden. Moreover, the Ground Peak has no need to rush to have another Ascension realm practitioner; let Yu Lingdian take her time, what belongs to her will not escape. Otherwise, if one day I am no longer present at the Ground Peak, with Yu Lingdian’s temperament, she would take the initiative to shoulder the burden herself. If her heart isn’t sufficiently strong, the principles of the other several lineages will diminish, and both the speaker and listener will subconsciously believe that way. This is human nature; there are no exceptions. A celestial mountain, filled with smoke and gathering dust, is a murky pool of stagnant water. The rules are written down on paper, left to gather dust in the ancestral hall, and have not taken root in the hearts of the practitioners.”

Li Liu said, “The rules established by any founding ancestor are of utmost importance.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man nodded, “Of course. For instance, sword immortal Bai Chang and others each have their own principles; naturally, they will branch out and bear fruit according to their thoughts. Anyone who can become the head of a celestial sect must have their own complete set of regulations. The key is who can persist in the long run, keeping the doors from rotting and gathering the wind and water. However, when it comes to guiding the path and walking it, the Ground Peak can truly deserve the saying that it is rare in the world; it now just lacks someone who can help the Ground Peak advance further.”

Li Liu laughed, “Zhang Shan Peak?”

The Fire Dragon Real Man said, “One can only say that the hope is greatest with him, but I hope that Yu Lingdian and her fellow senior brothers can also achieve that. However, I view the disciples and grand-disciples of the Ground Peak with different hopes; it’s not that the peak has the highest potential for achievement, so one can ignore the others.”

Li Liu shook her head, “You’re just speaking from a position of comfort. Would a golden immortal practitioner, a Jade Pure realm sect master, wish to think like this?”

The Fire Dragon Real Man laughed, countering, “Have I ever forced other sects to think like this?”

Finally, the Fire Dragon Real Man spoke solemnly, “But you should understand that if practitioners at my level do not wish to think this way, then the world will be in trouble.”

Li Liu smiled with a hint of mischief, “In trouble?”

The Fire Dragon Real Man said, “In our little chess game, losing a few games to you, even thousands of games, what does it matter? But in the grand chess game of the world, it’s not that I’m boasting; you all really can’t win.”

Li Liu smiled, “We don’t care.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man said, “Coincidentally, we care.”

Li Liu was about to set off for the Long Palace Cave.

The Northern Ju Lu had already reached the stage of official pieces. Lion Peak, the Da Yuan Dynasty’s Chong Xuan Office, the Yang family, and the Water Dragon Sect were all pieces. In truth, more pieces were her unreasonable hands, and with a wave, they would vanish, ultimately leaving only a few pieces placed according to the rules on the board, not many remaining.

In the end, she could obtain one of the two positions between the Spiritual Source Duke of Jidu and the Dragon Pavilion Marquis.

Moreover, even if she could gather both the Spiritual Dukes of Jidu, she would only take one.

After all, times had changed.

Originally, the Water Palace’s Shen Lin and the Spiritual Source Li Yuan could both aspire to this extremely esteemed position of Water God in Northern Ju Lu, with Li Yuan’s path seeming even more natural.

However, Li Liu’s “indifference” was her own affair; the little Water Zheng had been indifferent for hundreds of years, what could it be? If it were not for the Fire Dragon Real Man’s willingness to chat with Li Yuan a few more words at the start of the previous chess game, saying a few things, she would have gone to the Long Palace Cave and slapped down, smashing Li Yuan’s golden body to pieces, returning the water essence to Jidu. A new Water Zheng, willing to support the Water Dragon Sect, would only be more grateful.

The Fire Dragon Real Man suddenly said, “Li Liu, let’s open a new game; you surrender half, how about that?”

Li Liu certainly didn’t wish to play another game.

This was merely the Fire Dragon Real Man waiting here for Yu Lingdian, doing nothing and dragging her into a game. After all, a peak practitioner at the Ascension realm is not focused on their heart, let alone the absorption of earthly spiritual energy.

The Fire Dragon Real Man’s many seemingly casual words contained deep meanings, pointing out Yu Lingdian while also clarifying his relationship with her as a friend, sorting out the various connections of the Ground Peak, helping Li Liu see more of the human heart. However, this was the first time the Fire Dragon Real Man had explicitly revealed the true nature of their somewhat adversarial relationship.

Subsequently, Li Liu returned to the Long Palace Cave.

There would also be Li Yuan receiving a “Three-Foot Sweet Rain” jade token, while Shen Lin would eventually achieve the position of Duke of Spiritual Source in Jidu.

Shen Lin was incredulous, while Li Yuan could only pound his chest in despair.

As for whether Li Yuan knew that he was originally doomed to die and that someone would impersonate him as the Water Zheng at Jidu later on, he was merely saved by the Fire Dragon Real Man. The jade token of the dragon was obtained because of Chen Ping’an, and perhaps Li Yuan was still oblivious, living in a daze. 

To say this was bad, Li Yuan didn’t do much; it was as if he lay back and enjoyed the rewards, doing a few trivial things, obtaining a jade token that gathered incense without any effort. To say it was good, however, was ultimately because of his long-standing indifference to actions, which cost him the position of the Water God of Northern Ju Lu.

The Fire Dragon Real Man remained on the mountain peak, alone, recalling some past trivial matters, feeling quite troubled.

There were matters relating to the Ground Peak itself, the Northern Ju Lu beneath his feet, and the entire Great Harmony world.

The old master thought of these things and began to feel drowsy. Earlier, he had stomped his foot to come to this place, and now, with another stomp, he would return to the peak of the Ground Peak.

With a nap, snow would fall on the Ground Peak, allowing those little ones to have a snowball fight and enjoy themselves.

Zhang Shan Peak was crouched in the square, surrounded by a large circle of young disciples, most of whom were new faces. However, Zhang Shan Peak had always been familiar with dealing with children. At this moment, the young Daoist was telling them about the great difficulties of slaying demons and dispelling evil down the mountain. The little ones listened with wide eyes, eagerly leaning in, their fists clenched, each one more engrossed than the last, anxious about why their little master hadn’t yet arrived at the exciting part of the tale, where the peachwood sword swooshed through the air, triumphantly dispatching the demons.

Zhang Shan Peak paused his storytelling, lifted his head, and smiled, “Master, you’ve returned?”

The little disciples looked lively, bowing deeply in salute to their ancestral master. One of the bolder ones quietly tugged at the little master’s robe sleeve. Zhang Shan Peak looked around, and each of them nodded vigorously, signaling him.

Zhang Shan Peak said, “Master, it’s almost New Year’s down the mountain. It’s unusual for it not to snow in this big winter.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man walked over, reaching out to pat one little disciple’s head, smiling, “Then let the ancestral master put in a bit of effort and take a nap? In my dreams, I’ll ask the heavens for some heavy snow?”

All the little disciples perked up, nodding eagerly.

Only when the ancestral master fell asleep would it snow on the mountain.

This had been passed down from the master of the Ground Peak’s generation and the even older senior brothers.

The Fire Dragon Real Man smiled at Zhang Shan Peak, “After Yu Shixiong returns to the mountain, he will go down the mountain with you to fulfill a wish.”

Zhang Shan Peak was taken aback, “I asked that Baiyun Shixiong about this, and Baiyun Shixiong agreed; it has nothing to do with Yu Shixiong.”

The Fire Dragon Real Man laughed and scolded, “This little brat even deceives his own master.”

The little disciples gasped in surprise.

The ancestral master can curse too?!

The Fire Dragon Real Man felt somewhat helpless and was about to leave to find a place to sleep.

Zhang Shan Peak began to tidy up the mess for his master, earnestly advising the little ones, “Don’t learn to casually curse like your ancestral master.”

One little disciple crossed his arms and huffed, “The ancestral master has the highest status on the mountain. What’s wrong with cursing?”

Zhang Shan Peak gave this kid’s ear a gentle twist, lifting him slightly off the ground. The little disciple exclaimed and quickly stood on tiptoes, pleading, “Little master, don’t hit, I know I was wrong.”

Zhang Shan Peak laughed, releasing his grip, and the little disciple indignantly said, “My master said that if you don’t respect your elders, you’ll get spanked. Little master, you better watch out.”

Zhang Shan Peak squatted down and continued telling the story about slaying demons down the mountain.

The little disciple listened attentively, suddenly complaining, “Little master, aren’t there any good demons or ghosts down the mountain? If so, how come the ancestral master and the senior uncles allowed them to do bad things?”

Zhang Shan Peak smiled, “Well, of course, there’s an explanation for that. When my friend comes to our house as a guest, I’ll let him tell you; he has so many interesting stories about mountains and rivers.”

One little disciple shook his head vigorously, “I think he definitely can’t tell it better than little master!”

Zhang Shan Peak waved his hand, a bright smile on his face, “You’re just talking nonsense. Once it snows, we’ll have a snowball fight, and I’ll ally with you.”

The little disciple immediately refused, “No way!”

Having heard from the senior brothers that during every snowball fight, the little master received the worst of it because he was the tallest and ran fastest. Even if he was hit, he wouldn’t get angry.

Zhang Shan Peak tugged at the collar of his robe, adopting a serious demeanor, “Dare not respect your little master? Don’t you fear getting spanked?”

The little disciple frowned, softly murmuring, “Master left last year.”

Zhang Shan Peak was taken aback, letting out a sigh. He then pointed at the little disciple and smiled gently, “Actually, he hasn’t left. Don’t you remember your master?”

The little disciple lowered his head, tears in his eyes, and replied, “When my master left, he said this. Just think of him, and he hasn’t really left. No need to think about him all the time; just remembering him occasionally would be good. He also said that when I can think of him without being too sad, that means I’ve grown up. At that time, I can go down the mountain to slay demons and disperse evil. Little master, it’s been so long; over a year, and I still feel so sad.”

Zhang Shan Peak thought for a moment but couldn’t find any comforting words to say.

Perhaps Chen Ping’an would do better here. For all the separations in the world, despite his young age, Chen Ping’an had to undergo much more.

Unfortunately, he wasn’t here.

When he was younger, days seemed to pass one by one, counted on fingers.

As he grew older, months turned into years.

If he became a cultivator on the mountain, after reaching a higher realm, ten years or a hundred years would seem to pass in an instant. How many people around could he remember? And how many could truly be called people close to him?

Zhang Shan Peak had once asked his master many questions, but the Fire Dragon Real Man often would say that there were no answers, that the questions themselves were the answers, and many seemingly straightforward answers were just the next question.

Zhang Shan Peak didn’t feel his master was brushing him off, so he became even more bewildered.

Was the master’s Dao high?

Of course, it wasn’t high.

Because the master’s Dao was not on the mountain or in the sky, but in the human world at the foot of the mountain.

One little disciple curiously asked, “Little master, what are you thinking about?”

Zhang Shan Peak was just about to speak.

But one little one quietly remarked, “He’s definitely secretly thinking about some pretty girl down the mountain.”

Another little disciple chimed in, “Just speaking nonsense about important matters.”

Zhang Shan Peak chuckled, “Let’s put aside that story about slaying demons and dispersing evil for now; let me share a more exciting story from my reserved collection.”

Unexpectedly, one little disciple immediately said to his companions, “Don’t be scared; little master is definitely going to use ghost stories to scare us.”

Zhang Shan Peak looked at this group of clever little rascals. These little disciples were much more difficult to handle than the ones he had before going down the mountain.

Zhang Shan Peak had no choice but to bring out his trump card, loudly shouting, “Master, why hasn’t it snowed yet?”

The old master, who was napping on a distant cliff, opened his mouth and laughed, “After using the toilet, don’t you have to eat first?”

All the little disciples looked at this little master with pity, feeling he seemed a bit slow.

Zhang Shan Peak stood up, “Forget it, I’ll teach you all some boxing techniques.”

A hush fell over, and they all scattered.

Without snow, there were no stories, and in the cold winter, there were no wild fruits on the mountain. None of the masters allowed anyone to get spanked, so the little master was of no use.

Suddenly, Zhang Shan Peak noticed one little disciple had stopped and wasn’t leaving.

Zhang Shan Peak, feeling satisfied, smiled and waved, “Good, good, good! Little master will teach you some boxing techniques.”

That little disciple grinned, mumbling something, and then threw a few awkward punches before running away, leaving behind, “Did little master learn it?” 

Zhang Shan Peak scratched his head.

These little disciples were too slick. The little master simply couldn’t keep up.

As dusk fell, in a small town at the foot of Lion Peak.

A young outsider wearing a blue robe, carrying a bamboo box and mountain staff, walked into a popular fabric shop.

A woman serving customers turned around upon noticing a guest entering and smiled, “Oh, this young man has come to pick out some silk for your wife, to make a nice outfit?”

Chen Ping’an replied in the local dialect, “Aunt Liu, I’m Chen Ping’an, I live in Mud Bottle Alley.”

The woman was taken aback, “Isn’t my son Huai often talking about that Chen Ping’an?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, gently placing the large and small gifts he had bought from the town on the counter.

The woman quickly set aside her work, letting a few well-off town ladies select their fabrics, bringing Chen Ping’an a long bench and inviting him to sit, “Sit down quickly. Li Huai’s father has gone up the mountain, and it’s uncertain when he’ll be back. But as long as there aren’t any fox spirits up there, he’ll surely be back before dark. But if you ask me, if there are really any fox spirits up there, they wouldn’t even look at that blockhead Li Er, right? It’s just that I was blind back then, foolishly falling for him.”

The woman sat on one end of the long bench, chatting comfortably with Chen Ping’an, “Mud Bottle Alley, I know it well. It’s quite close to the Iron Lock Well, a small alley with not many people. At the end of the alley, there’s a young widow, not as pretty as me, and not far from Mud Bottle Alley is that Ma Shenpo from Apricot Blossom Alley. You should know her, right? That woman, the older she gets, the sharper her tongue becomes. Tsk, tsk, tsk. If you ask me, she can bring the dead back to life. The widow from Mud Bottle Alley can’t compete with her in arguments.”

Chen Ping’an gently placed the gifts on the counter, having taken off his bamboo box and placed it at his feet, leaning his mountain staff aside, quietly and patiently listening to the woman chat about hometown matters.

Suddenly, the woman slapped her thigh, “My daughter Li Liu, that heartless girl, have you seen her? I suppose you haven’t had a chance to meet yet. Oh, Chen Ping’an, you don’t know, our girl has rebelled; she’s gone to serve tea for the mountain deity and has completely forgotten her parents. She hasn’t come home for quite a while, and if she really gets swayed by some smooth-talking scoundrel out there, I won’t be heartbroken. I’d just consider it a waste of raising such a girl. It’s just a pity that my son Li Huai can’t count on his sister and brother-in-law.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “Li Huai will have a bright future. I know Li Huai; although he isn’t the fastest reader, he has persistence. Most importantly, this child has a good heart; he’s kind to uncles and aunts, which isn’t something that can be learned from books. Moreover, Miss Li has become a deity on the mountain, with no worries about food and clothing, and it’s close by, right up at Lion Peak. Aunt Liu, this is quite rare for many families with children going up to cultivate. You can trust that Miss Li will definitely find a good family member who can talk about family matters. I’m not just saying this to flatter you; Aunt Liu, you are blessed. For us common folk, we always look forward to better days, adding a jar or two today, saving up for a table tomorrow, gradually filling our homes with things, and naturally, life will become prosperous.”

The woman beamed, “This young man looks handsome and speaks so well. And it’s not some flashy flattery; it’s all real talk that even I find reasonable.”

Moreover, being able to take such good care of Li Huai along the way, how bad could his character be? Although he didn’t seem like a wealthy person given his attire, as long as he was honest, he wouldn’t treat Li Huai poorly when he eventually became her brother-in-law. Rather, he would surely do his utmost to support Li Huai.

Why not play matchmaker between Chen Ping’an and her daughter? The moment she thought of this, she began to look at the young man from afar with the eye of a potential father-in-law.

Not bad, not bad. He was neat and tidy, a meticulous young man who could take care of others. It wasn’t that she disrespected that boy from the academy named Lin Shouyi; it was just that she always felt the two were worlds apart. The Grand Sui Capital was so big and bustling, how could it lack beautiful women? What if Lin Shouyi changed his mind one day? Wouldn’t her daughter end up as an old maid, without a marriage?

Li Liu, that girl, indeed took after her mother; it was true she was beautiful, but the woman knew that beauty alone didn’t amount to much. If not careful, she could end up with a heartless man. Originally, the prettier the face, the more troublesome it became. If one wasn’t careful, the little life could turn miserable, and after seven or eight years, she might not even dare look in the mirror.

The more she thought about it, the more she felt pleased. It was not that she was fickle; that honest child who used to help around the house, Dong Shueijing, was indeed upright and honest. Still, she always felt something was off about him. Lin Shouyi, who was said to be a scholar, seemed too high to reach. After all, she had heard that boy’s father worked in the Bureau of Construction, and his position was not small. Moreover, families who could move to the capital must have a high threshold. If Li Liu truly married into that family, that naive girl who had no understanding of social nuances would definitely end up suffering. She couldn’t allow Li Huai to just visit her sister, only to be looked down upon by the gatekeeper.

Chen Ping’an could never have imagined that Aunt Liu was calculating something. Seeing the elder smile and fall silent, he feared the atmosphere would drop. He took the initiative to engage in small talk.

Chen Ping’an suddenly turned his head and then looked back, smiling, “Aunt, Uncle Li is back.”

The woman leaned out to peek at the entrance and saw that it was indeed true. She smiled, “It’s time for dinner. Aunt will make you a home-cooked meal.”

The woman stood up, habitually calling out loudly, “Li Er!”

A man immediately jogged over.

The woman complained, “Didn’t you see that Chen Ping’an is at our house? Why did you take so long to come back? Did it seem like you found money outside?”

Li Er smiled as he crossed the threshold, “I’m here.”

Chen Ping’an had already stood up, calling out, “Uncle Li.”

The woman saw Li Er intending to sit in her spot and scolded, “Are you going to buy some wine? Are you saving your pocket money to buy those fox spirits some rouge?”

Li Er mumbled, “I never have money.”

The woman slapped the counter heavily, “Take the money from the drawer yourself and quickly buy two jars of good wine. After buying the wine, let Chen Ping’an stay in the room prepared for Li Huai. Think about whether there’s anything missing while you’re at it. When you go to buy wine, buy everything at once.”

Turning to Chen Ping’an, she switched to a smiling face, “Chen Ping’an, once you arrive here, it’s just like coming home. Don’t be too polite; Aunt might get angry.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “No need to be polite with Aunt. A plate of winter bamboo shoots stir-fried with meat must be included.”

The woman laughed, “Of course, it must be included.”

Li Er took the money and left with Chen Ping’an, both heading out to the gradually quieting street.

Chen Ping’an quietly asked, “Uncle Li, do you know where Li Xisheng from Fulu Street is? He’s Li Baoping’s elder brother, do you know where he is in Northern Ju Lu?”

Li Er replied, “I know. He brought a rather peculiar companion, a student, to visit me here. I’ll tell you the details later.”

Chen Ping’an let out a sigh of relief.

Otherwise, it would be quite hard for him to find.

After a moment of hesitation, Li Er looked around and finally turned to a specific direction, furrowing his brow, and then threw out a punch.

On the entire street, only Chen Ping’an vaguely sensed a cue.

Even if someone was nearby, they wouldn’t have the ability to see Li Er throw a punch.

Then, in the distant sea of clouds, a dull thunderous sound erupted that could be heard throughout the small town.

After throwing the punch, Li Er didn’t explain anything, merely saying, “Li Xisheng asked me to tell you something before you look for him: the peach talisman he sent you back then was not some impulsive act. Of course, in the end, you didn’t accept it. Subsequently, he drew a talisman for the Falling Rock Mountain Bamboo Loft, resolving a rather significant karmic relationship with you, so Li Xisheng wants you to not feel grateful. If you can’t do that, you don’t need to seek him out.”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Understood.”

Li Er arrived at a tavern at the street corner, took out money, and bought two jars of the finest wine, saying, “Thanks to you.”

A young wine drinker laughed and asked, “Li Er, isn’t Li Liu down the mountain? She hasn’t become accustomed to living in the mountain deity’s abode and now looks down upon the little hovel down here?”

Li Er paid no mind.

On the way back, Li Er nodded and smiled, “Your sixth realm is quite solid.”

At Li Er’s side, Chen Ping’an felt little need for caution and said, “In the eastern part of Jidu, I received pointers on three punches from Senior Gu You.”

Li Er responded with an “mm” but quickly added, “Three punches are still a bit insufficient.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “It couldn’t be helped; at the time, Senior Gu had to rush to an appointment to duel with the senior from Yuanting Mountain.”

Li Er hadn’t gone to watch that fight.

Because it wasn’t necessary.

Li Er said, “That’s fine; there’s no shortage of food at my place, and I have punches too.”

Chen Ping’an contemplated, “Let’s eat well first before discussing this.”

Li Er rarely displayed a serious expression. He turned and asked, “I need to know one thing first, what are you seeking? The title of ‘strongest’?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head with a smile, “From the first day of practicing boxing, I never sought that. During the period, due to others, I thought about the strongest and martial fortune, but in the end, I found that the two are not mutually exclusive.”

Li Er continued to watch Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an continued, “If practicing boxing relies solely on myself, whether it’s spirit or strength, my boxing intent has reached its peak. Then, since I know Uncle Li, of course, I can seek once externally. I have no interest in martial fortune, but I must break through with a heavier boxing intent. To put it simply, this golden body realm must be the golden body realm that surpasses my physical limits. I only seek this.”

Li Er didn’t say anything about practicing boxing but grinned, “If you don’t eat your fill, Aunt Liu won’t allow it. If she doesn’t allow it, I wouldn’t dare clear the table.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled softly, “That’s wonderful.”

Only then did Li Er pat Chen Ping’an’s shoulder, “Eat well and drink enough, then we can talk about this.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 658: Both Master and Apprentice Practice Boxing in Vain

At the dining table, Li Er was feeling a bit uneasy. This was the second time his wife had insisted that he drink more, even though he had opened up a bottle. It had been many years since the last time this happened. 

Seeing Chen Ping'an deliberately suppressing his martial intent, he quickly drank a few cups, and soon his face was flushed. Li Er felt something was off. Was he thinking that getting drunk and passing out would save him from a beating? But this didn’t seem like something Chen Ping'an would do.

However, he was glad to drink freely with someone, so Li Er propped one leg on the bench. Just as he raised his foot, reaching for the stir-fried winter bamboo shoots and meat that was placed far from him, his wife shot him a glare, instructing him to behave like a proper elder. Li Er felt tangled up and had no choice but to sit up straight. He had never seen her so particular before. In the past, when he had a drink or two, she would ignore it. This was just how their family operated; when Li Huai was young, he would sit on the bench eating chicken legs and pig trotters without any regard for decorum. In Li Er's household, there were no rules about women not eating at the table.

Li Er glanced at the plate of food intentionally placed next to Chen Ping'an and noticed his wife looking at him. He understood immediately that the stir-fried bamboo shoots and meat had nothing to do with him.

At the table, all the meat dishes were in front of Chen Ping'an, while Li Er was left with some plain vegetable dishes. He took a sip of wine and smiled, feeling oddly nostalgic. This scene was familiar to him.

When Li Huai was away studying and traveling, their family had always been like this.

Now that Li Huai was at the Daxu Academy, they had moved to the foot of Lion Peak in North Julu Prefecture. Even though Li Liu often came down from the mountain, and the three of them would gather for meals, without Li Huai's lively presence, Li Er felt something was missing. He didn’t have any preference for sons over daughters; it had nothing to do with who Li Liu was. Over the years, Li Er had one requirement of Li Liu: solve external problems outside the home and don’t bring them back. Of course, his son-in-law could be an exception.

Chen Ping'an was about seventy to eighty percent drunk, not to the point of slurring his words or stumbling as he left the Eight Immortals table and went to Li Huai's room to rest. He took off his boots, lay down gently, and closed his eyes. Suddenly, he sat up, turned his boots around so that the toes faced inward, and then lay back down peacefully to sleep.

He found himself missing the dilapidated mountain of his hometown and his first disciple.

While Li Er was busy clearing the table, his wife, still sitting there, suddenly asked, “Li Er, what do you think of that Chen Ping'an boy?”

Li Er smiled, “He’s a good kid.”

Otherwise, that man back then wouldn't have thought of selling the Dragon King’s basket and golden carp to Chen Ping'an without permission, which led him to get a scolding at Yang’s shop.

His wife lowered her voice, “Do you think he has an eye for our daughter?”

Li Er paused his actions and helplessly replied, “It’s not about whether he likes her or not; Chen Ping'an already has someone he likes.”

His wife was deeply disappointed, “Our daughter just doesn’t have good luck.”

Li Er smiled and remained silent.

His wife slammed the table, annoyed, “What are you laughing at? Is Li Liu really your biological daughter? Did I steal her from another man?”

Li Er shrank his neck and mumbled, “What nonsense are you saying?”

His wife sighed, “Our daughter is naïve, and her father is useless and careless. What kind of karma did our daughter accumulate in her past life to be reborn into this family and suffer? Is Li Huai going to have to take care of his parents and wife in the future? In the end, will even his married sister have to look after them for a lifetime?”

Li Er curiously asked, “But what about Dong Shuijing and Lin Shouyi, who studied with Li Huai? Didn’t they both like our daughter since they were kids? I’ve never seen you care this much before. And that scholar we walked with last time, didn’t he seem pretty decent?”

His wife shook her head, “That’s different. No matter how I look at it, I still think Chen Ping'an is most like Mr. Qi from our academy. I can’t explain the reason, but I have a knack for reading people.”

Li Er didn’t reply, nodding as he continued to clean up the tableware.

The last time his wife had urged him to drink, it was when Mr. Qi came to visit.

His wife tentatively asked, “Do you think our daughter really has a chance?”

Li Er felt a little guilty. After all this drinking, he might have missed out on a chance for Chen Ping'an, who could have been well-fed and satisfied.

The next day, as dawn broke, Chen Ping'an woke up, helped draw water and returned. At the well, the neighbors mentioned that he was a distant relative of the Li family.

Then Li Er took Chen Ping'an out to Lion Peak, telling his wife they were going for a walk in the mountains. His wife beamed with joy, laughing heartily and not saying anything further. Li Er was a bit confused, unsure of what she was planning.

He led Chen Ping'an directly to the Patriarch Hall of Lion Peak.

On the way, they chatted about Zheng Dafu guarding the dilapidated mountain, and Li Er expressed his gratitude.

Chen Ping'an said it was nothing.

Li Er, however, remarked that with Zheng Dafu’s temperament, if it had been in the past, he would have become a good-for-nothing in a foreign land, never wishing to return to Yang’s shop, just waiting to die. He would have lived a haphazard life, and in the end, his master would not have regarded Zheng Dafu as a disciple even once, nor would Zheng Dafu have dared to consider himself a disciple. Now, despite being dilapidated, the master-disciple relationship was still established, which was quite different.

Chen Ping'an always felt that Uncle Li was the kind of person who understood life the best.

Now it seemed indeed true.

The master of Lion Peak, Huang Cai, was a celestial figure with an extraordinary demeanor.

Huang Cai was famous among the Yuanying cultivators of North Julu Prefecture for his fighting prowess.

Li Er wasted no time on pleasantries and directly ordered the renowned old Yuanying cultivator to seal off the mountain.

Without a word, Huang Cai immediately sent out orders to seal Lion Peak, without mentioning when it would be reopened.

For a celestial mountain, sealing it was an extraordinary matter.

Either there was a great enemy approaching, or an ancestor was going into seclusion to break through.

Li Er handed Huang Cai a piece of paper, instructing him to gather herbs according to what was written. 

Huang Cai still didn’t ask a single question.

However, the way he looked at the young outsider was a bit strange.

If Chen Ping'an had thought that things were a bit dark at the foot of the mountain, now, when dealing with outsiders, he had opened up completely, but he didn’t explain anything further.

Everything could wait until Li Liu returned to Lion Peak.

Li Er took Chen Ping'an to an ancient estate at the summit of Lion Peak, which had been the place where the mountain’s founding ancestor practiced cultivation. After the ancestor passed away, it had never been opened again. Only when Li Liu returned to Lion Peak did the gates reopen. Inside was a hidden world, one that even Huang Cai was not qualified to step into. 

Upon entering, Chen Ping'an discovered it was actually a waterway cave. Once past the mountain water barrier at the gate, it led to a ferry where the water flowed with a greenish hue and a small boat was moored. Li Er personally took the pole and moved forward. Inside the cave, there was neither sunlight nor moonlight, nor did it have the luminous stones or candles of celestial beings, yet it was still bright as day.

After traveling for several miles in the small boat, the view suddenly opened up. In the distance was a peculiar mirror, as large as a lake, slightly below the surface of the water, with streams rushing into it from all directions, disappearing without a trace.

Li Er explained, “This mirror is the entrance to an ancient cave. Someone didn’t like that cave, so they created this formation to keep it flooded. The mirror surface is remarkably tough; ordinary punches at the tenth realm are ineffective. Even when I once broke it for a moment with my ‘Return to True’ eighty punches, it still restored itself. It is said that only the last stage of the tenth realm, ‘Divine Arrival,’ can completely shatter the mirror. I still need to polish my martial intent for a long time before I have a chance to reach ‘Divine Arrival.’ Only then will I have broken through the dead end of martial arts and walked the true path to ascend.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and couldn’t help but say, “What a rare celestial treasure. How regrettable it would be to completely shatter it.”

As for the three realms of a martial artist’s tenth level, he had heard of them and just needed to remember.

Li Er laughed, “When you’re capable of breaking the mirror with just your fists, then you can talk about regret.”

At this moment, Chen Ping'an felt that the person standing beside him was no longer Li Er.

But rather, a martial artist at the tenth realm.

With Li Er’s figure fading away, Chen Ping'an instinctively felt something was wrong. Sure enough, without warning, a sweeping kick came from behind.

Chen Ping'an’s stance seemed to collapse, his martial intent retracting. He didn’t care about maintaining any form as he tried to lunge forward but was unexpectedly kicked hard in the lower back, the sound echoing like a series of firecrackers. 

Even someone as strong as Chen Ping'an, who could treat an ordinary martial artist’s physique as if it were made of paper, was kicked backward as if a bow had been drawn, and with a bang, he should have been sent flying several dozen feet. However, Li Er’s punch was far quicker than Chen Ping'an’s retreat. Standing beside him, he delivered a punch downwards, striking Chen Ping'an in the chest.

This punch caused Chen Ping'an's back to hit the ground instantly.

Li Er extended a leg, twisting his ankle and effortlessly flipping Chen Ping'an, who had crashed onto his back, onto the mirror.

Feeling as if his pure true energy was about to shatter, Chen Ping'an crashed heavily onto the mirror, bouncing a few times. He slammed his palm against the mirror, spun to his feet, but couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

Li Er remained standing on the small boat, both he and the boat completely still. The man slowly said, “Be careful, I don’t hold back when I punch. Back when I was at the peak of the ninth realm, I fought with Song Changjing at Liuzhu Cave and almost accidentally killed him.”

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, seeing that Li Er had no intention of attacking immediately, he gently rolled up his sleeves, lightly pressed his toes against the mirror, and indeed found it exceptionally solid. 

It felt like getting used to walking on the muddy paths of Muddled Bottle Lane and then stepping onto the cobblestones of Fortune and Lu Streets. This meant that being hit by Li Er’s punch was one kind of pain, and then crashing against the mirror was another, adding fuel to the fire, even worse than hitting the walls of the bamboo house on Dilapidated Mountain.

Chen Ping'an swayed unsteadily, smiling wryly as he asked, “Uncle Li, are you only using the ninth realm to punch?”

Li Er shook his head, “Of course not.”

Before Chen Ping'an could feel a bit better, Li Er added, “There’s also the tenth realm.”

Since this kid dared to call him Uncle Li, he wouldn’t let Chen Ping'an off the hook easily.

Li Er believed in being generous.

After dinner and drinks, there was another big piece of news coming from the mountains of North Julu Prefecture.

The leader of the Qingliang Sect, He Xiaoliang, had a mysterious conflict with the infatuated Xu Xuan on his way back to the sect. 

They were supposed to be a pair of celestial lovers, but instead of achieving anything, following some quarrel, they ended up in a fight. In a secluded mountain area of the Hualing Dynasty, after claiming their territory, He Xiaoliang and Xu Xuan fought so fiercely that the landscape changed for hundreds of miles, and the spiritual energy of the mountains and rivers became chaotic.

Xu Xuan was heavily injured and fled, but not only did He Xiaoliang directly kill his two close maidservants, but two young Golden Core female cultivators also perished. He Xiaoliang managed to seize the two precious weapons, the cough pearls and the talismans, taking them back to the Qingliang Sect. Then he casually discarded the two treasures outside the sect gate, proclaiming that if Xu Xuan had the ability, he could come and take them back. If he didn’t have the ability and lacked the courage, he could let his master Bai Chang take them instead.

After Xu Xuan returned to his mountain, he entered seclusion to heal. Rumor had it that what had originally been a sure thing for him to ascend to the fifth realm would be delayed by at least ten years. This meant that once Liu Jinglong broke through, he would be able to withstand Xu Xuan’s three challenges, including those from Li Cai and Dong Zhu. Xu Xuan would not only be ten years behind Liu Jinglong in cultivation but also, among the young disciples of North Julu Prefecture, second only to Lin Su, he would be demoted in status.

The first swordsman of the North, Bai Chang, did not stand by idly. However, he did not rely on his status as a swordsman or his celestial realm to go to the Qingliang Sect and demand an explanation from He Xiaoliang. Bai Chang only said one thing: as long as he was in North Julu Prefecture, He Xiaoliang would never ascend to the realm of ascension.

The two sects, which were once expected to unite through marriage, had now become deadly enemies.

Many fence-sitters, including the Qionglin Sect, began to sever ties with the Qingliang Sect, complicating various business dealings.

Many secular powers, including the Han family of the Hualing Dynasty, began to secretly backtrack, with many aspiring cultivators who had planned to head to the Qingliang Sect turning back halfway.

Many celestial mountains surrounding the Qingliang Sect also started to distance themselves from the already unstable sect, strictly forbidding their disciples from having too much contact with the Qingliang Sect.

A direct disciple of the Heavenly Lord Xie Shi came to the Qingliang Sect aggressively. However, He Xiaoliang had no regard for propriety, and what should have been a close relationship turned into a heated argument. After that, the Qingliang Sect appeared increasingly isolated, with no support from all sides, allies no longer allies, and those who were not allies turning into potential enemies, causing all sorts of trouble. No one believed that a newly established sect that had thoroughly angered the great swordsman Bai Chang could thrive for long in North Julu Prefecture.

Meanwhile, the Qingliang Sect was also in turmoil.

Half of the offerings and guest elders had severed ties with the Qingliang Sect, sending letters of separation. The seats in the Patriarch Hall were reduced by more than five in one night.

He Xiaoliang was also a peculiar person; he didn’t break or smash those seats but simply moved them out of the Patriarch Hall and placed them under the eaves outside.

With so few disciples in the Qingliang Sect, the mountain seemed increasingly desolate.

Fortunately, during her travels in North Julu Prefecture, He Xiaoliang had gathered nine named disciples, and they remained stable, with no one choosing to defect from the Qingliang Sect. To the outside world, it seemed these individuals were unaware of the significance of Bai Chang’s name and were completely ignorant of the dangers after the mountain's feud and broken relationships.

These nine disciples were the first generation of disciples after the establishment of the Qingliang Sect. They were mostly ordinary folks who had not practiced cultivation before, with age differences not significant; the oldest was barely thirty, and the youngest was only five or six.

He Xiaoliang had a rather strange approach to accepting disciples. While she did consider their talent and potential, she didn’t prioritize it above all. As long as they were willing to walk the path of cultivation, it was sufficient, and more so, she relied on her own intuition.

Today, He Xiaoliang left her secluded cave and occupied a feng shui treasure spot. However, she didn’t make any major constructions; she only opened up a small piece of land on the mountainside, with each thatched cottage close together. The nine disciples lived there, while the place used for teaching and resolving doubts resembled a wealthy family’s ancestral hall, serving both for ancestor worship and inviting scholars to educate disciples.

He Xiaoliang only taught her disciples a single Daoist mantra without distinctions of rank, and beyond that, she didn’t interfere much. She had invited an outsider to teach her disciples daily. This person was neither an offering nor a guest elder, yet he had been teaching the nine disciples for several years. He did not confine himself to the intricacies of Daoist scriptures but taught various teachings from the three teachings and a hundred schools of thought. 

He Xiaoliang seemed to trust this “Mr. Li” very much, not worried that his teachings might mislead the students or hinder their cultivation. She was also not concerned that her Qingliang Sect, which she had vowed not to accept disciples for a hundred years, would become a mishmash of a celestial sect.

The nine temporarily unnamed disciples had great respect for the young teacher, whose surname was only known as Li.

He Xiaoliang arrived outside the lecture hall.

That Mr. Li was discussing Confucian poetry, first mentioning the merits of lines like “The pond grows spring grass” and “The bright moon shines on tall buildings,” lamenting how such seemingly straightforward verses reflected profound skill, leaving future poets regretting being born too late. He then smoothly transitioned to discussing the character of an ancient ancestor of a powerful family or mountain sect, how their temperament would influence family and sect traditions, and finally told the nine, that if they became the founding ancestors in the future, they should act accordingly to minimize errors and maximize correctness.

Seeing the master appear, some disciples began to rise to pay respects, but He Xiaoliang gestured for them to remain seated, indicating that the teacher held the highest authority in the teaching place.

That young Mr. Li threw out a question for the nine students to ponder before leaving the classroom to catch up with He Xiaoliang.

He said, “Sect Master He, there really was no need for you to act like this… But never mind, as an outsider, I won’t pry too much. However, I can assure you, Bai Chang’s words have always held weight.”

Even though He Xiaoliang was a direct disciple of the Daoist master, they were still separated by a world.

Moreover, the actions of the swordsman of North Julu Prefecture, if he truly wanted to act, would hardly consider these things.

Now Bai Chang was clearly indifferent.

It was said that a long time ago, there was an ancient swordsman who pointed his sword at a student of a sage, laughingly asking whether he thought the sword would strike down.

Of course, the answer would be a resounding yes.

But in the end, that swordsman died at the Sword Qi Great Wall, while that Confucian sage went on to establish the Fushui Academy in North Julu Prefecture, offering protection to the descendants of that swordsman during his lifetime.

He Xiaoliang smiled and said, “Mr. Li, I’ve only been in the Jade Purity realm for a few years. By the time I reach the next celestial realm, and hit a bottleneck, it’ll take a few hundred years. If Bai Chang is willing to wait, then so be it.”

This scholar, whom He Xiaoliang addressed as Mr. Li, responded, “Earlier, the disciple of Heavenly Lord Xie Shi was rather aggressive.”

He Xiaoliang replied, “During his travels, he received guidance from Bai Chang, who had a debt of teaching towards him. Moreover, the establishment of the Qingliang Sect has encroached upon a considerable amount of the Daoist luck in North Julu Prefecture. Naturally, he would side with Xu Xuan and Bai Chang.”

Mr. Li shook his head, “If the reasoning can be applied that way, I think there are significant issues with Heavenly Lord Xie Shi’s teachings.”

He Xiaoliang couldn’t help but laugh.

Mr. Li questioned, “Did I make a mistake?”

In all matters, one should first consider their own mistakes; this was the foundation of this scholar’s learning.

He Xiaoliang shook her head, “I hope that one day you can speak these words directly to Heavenly Lord Xie Shi.”

Mr. Li chuckled, “If the opportunity arises, I might try. But given how Xie Shi and the whole sect behave, it may not be well-received.”

He Xiaoliang didn’t linger on this topic, afraid she would burst into laughter, while also feeling a bit sorry for the aggressive disciple of the Heavenly Lord.

She turned her head to look at a handsome young man named Cui Ci, who was the attendant and student of Mr. Li, running alongside him for many years.

Mr. Li said, “I should go down the mountain now.”

He Xiaoliang bowed, “I dare not keep you any longer, sir.”

Li Xisheng, as a student of Confucianism, performed a bow of respect.

Even though the other party did not return the gesture with a bow, He Xiaoliang still shifted her steps, moving aside. Yet, being in the Jade Purity realm and on the mountain of the Qingliang Sect, her movements were so subtle that at least in Cui Ci’s eyes, the sect master seemed to have remained in place, gracefully accepting a bow from her teacher.

In the royal study of the Great Li capital.

The small morning court had just dispersed.

The national teacher Cui Zhan, however, rarely did not leave.

This was unprecedented.

Emperor Song He said nothing, simply waiting for the national teacher’s next words.

Cui Zhan stood from his chair, gently brushed his fingers together, and a large scroll appeared in the royal study, depicting the lands of Baoping Continent, North Julu Prefecture, and Tongye Continent.

The young emperor quickly rose and approached Cui Zhan.

Cui Zhan slowly stated, “In large morning assemblies, a monarch discusses present matters with civil and military officials, usually looking ahead no more than three to five years. In small morning assemblies, a monarch discusses long-term plans of thirty to fifty years with ministers. What I discuss privately with Your Majesty is a plan for a hundred years. You might see part of the process, but you may not witness the final outcome.”

Song He softly replied, “Just like my father back then, who couldn’t foresee the Great Li iron cavalry’s hooves trampling on the shores of the Old Dragon City?”

Cui Zhan spoke frankly, “Exactly.”

Song He not only felt disheartened but was instead filled with joy, laughing, “Sir, I’ve actually been waiting for this day.”

In front of the national teacher, as long as there were no other ministers present, the young emperor maintained a student’s demeanor.

He didn’t need his mother, the empress dowager, to remind him of this.

Cui Zhan continued, “Once the situation on Baoping Continent stabilizes, it will inevitably need to be entrusted to the Hanlin Academy to compile the biographies of the ministers from various vassal states, both loyal and treasonous. This is not something that can be revealed while you are still on the throne, lest it cool the hearts of the ministers in court. Only the successor can handle this matter. This is a family matter between Baoping Continent and the Great Li Dynasty; Your Majesty can think it over first and draft a set of regulations for me to review later, to check for any omissions. Repairing the hearts of the people is as important as repairing the old mountains and rivers.”

After discussing this matter, Cui Zhan pointed to the vast North Julu Prefecture, “Looking at such a vast expanse of North Julu Prefecture, what do you think, Your Majesty?”

Song He answered, “Compared to before, it feels rather hollow.”

A continent of sword cultivators had already headed towards the Upside Down Mountain.

Cui Zhan nodded and added, “I advise Your Majesty, the Song family of the Great Li should never think about extending their influence over other continents; it’s impossible.”

Song He felt a bit regretful.

He thought that this national teacher of the Great Li, his own teacher, would have ambitions larger than he had imagined.

Cui Zhan smiled, “Great ambition with little talent also results in hollowness.”

Song He’s expression turned awkward.

Cui Zhan pointed to the Bone Beach, the southernmost part of North Julu Prefecture, “To build a long bridge between the Cloud Mountain and the Bone Beach, what do you think should be done?”

Song He laughed, “Rely on celestial money.”

Cui Zhan nodded but then asked, “But where does the true source of celestial money come from?”

Song He’s gaze swept across the scroll, looking towards the southernmost continent beyond Baoping, “Is it destined to be fragmented Tongye Continent?”

Cui Zhan neither nodded in agreement nor shook his head in denial but instead asked, “What is the fundamental way to earn and spend money?”

Song He shook his head, finding the question too broad.

Cui Zhan stated, “Understanding how to earn money should revolve around how to spend it. Otherwise, what’s the point of leaving it in the treasury? Can the gold and silver of each household still be eaten? This is the self-rescue act of the Song family of the Great Li after establishing a territory on a continent.”

Cui Zhan raised his sleeves, pointing simultaneously to the northern and southern ends of Baoping Continent, giving his answer, “How to earn money from North Julu Prefecture is for how to reasonably remedy the broken rivers and mountains of Tongye Continent. This back and forth may seem like the Great Li is not earning money, but in fact, it has always been accumulating national strength. At the same time, we have received the endorsement of the Confucian temple. It is not because I, Cui Zhan, or you, Emperor Song He, know how to govern, but because the national policy of the Great Li truly aligns with the rituals and rules of Confucianism, becoming the trend of the times. In this way, you, Song He, and I, Cui Zhan, can make some people unhappy. Even if they have the ability to make us and the Great Li uncomfortable, the Confucian temple will observe coldly, ensuring that they’ll be dealt with swiftly.”

Cui Zhan withdrew his hands and turned to focus on Song He, his expression slightly cold, “What I mean by saying all this is not to imply that you, Your Majesty, are wiser and more capable than the late emperor. It’s just that your luck is better, having ascended to the throne a bit later and seated higher. But you need not be angry. The merits and demerits of the previous emperor are all his. In the future, both the merits and faults should belong to you alone. When you govern the country, there’s no need to compare yourself to a dead emperor. If you can’t recognize this, then what I’m saying today is still too early.”

Song He bowed, “Thank you for your guidance, sir. I will remember it.”

Cui Zhan said, “Erasing some of the late emperor's governance traces is not difficult; the late emperor has died, and a new emperor has ascended. What’s so hard about it? Those old foxes in the Ministry of Rites will only mock you for being petty. In fact, you don’t need to say or do much; just wait a few more years, and the old and young civil and military officials will naturally become wise enough to leave no traces. As the emperor of the Great Li, aiming for a continent where the nation’s four corners are vast seas, this is unprecedented in history. You should show some imperial aura to match it. When the day comes that the old ministers of the previous dynasty remain loyal and respectful even after I, Cui Zhan, have left the small morning court, that will be your true ability, Song He. If one day I, Cui Zhan, also cannot regard you as a student, then that will be the true mark of a thousand-year emperor.”

Cui Zhan continued, “Of course, these two tasks are very difficult, but Your Majesty can give them a try. The notion that the emperor’s temperament is hard to gauge is merely a technique, not to be entirely disregarded, but it must not be the main focus. Even if the Song family’s dynasty will eventually come to an end one day, every history book that writes about the Great Li will unavoidably include a detailed account of you, Song He. You cannot escape it, whether in praise or condemnation.”

Finally, Cui Zhan smiled, “Next, I must discuss the strategies and existing pieces for the two continents. After all, you are still you, and the national teacher will remain the national teacher. As the national teacher, it is my duty to propose strategies, while as a monarch, it is your responsibility to steer the nation.”

Song He smiled, “National teacher, please speak; I wish to hear more details.”

After a brutal practice session, Pei Qian was carried back to the first floor by Chen Ruchu and surprisingly received three days off, not including the day and night spent lying in bed unable to move.

Just in time, she heard that Wei Ban was about to hold the third Divine Night Tour Feast, which made Pei Qian, who had just finished copying books, overjoyed.

Zhu Lian called this a case of “Three days of no beatings bring a roof down.”

With her spirits high, Pei Qian didn’t argue with the old chef.

Besides, her master had officially promised in the letter sent back to the dilapidated mountain that he would promote Zhou Mili to be the right protector of the dilapidated mountain. After reading the letter seventeen or eighteen times, when she returned to the second floor to practice boxing for the first time, she strode with her chest held high down the bamboo house stairs, shouting for Old Chen to hurry and open the door to spar, lest he dawdle.

Seeing this, Chen Lingjun on the first floor thought Pei Qian had either gone mad or was possessed.

Meanwhile, in Zhu Lian’s courtyard, Wei Ban was playing chess with Zheng Dafu.

Chen Ruchu was lightly cracking sunflower seeds.

Chen Lingjun bet on Zheng Dafu winning and placed a large handful of snowflake coins next to Dafu’s chess jar. Zhu Lian kept mumbling that Wei Ban was already a Jade Purity realm celestial being, and his chess skills had greatly improved, so he should have a better chance of winning. Chen Lingjun, however, watched the chess game unfold and placed a small summer coin beside Wei Ban’s jar.

Pei Qian, carrying a hiking stick, ran around the stone table with Zhou Mili, both of them laughing wildly.

Pei Qian swaggered about, arms flailing, singing, “Cheng dong cheng, lang li ge cheng, lang li ge cheng, dong dong cheng... We’re going to set up a feast from the village head to the village tail... Liu family gold, Li family silver, Han family copper coins, all obediently come sleep in my pocket.”

Wei Ban leaned his elbow on the table, lightly tapping his finger on his forehead.

Once you’re on the boat, it’s hard to get off.

After all, his reputation as the North Yu God had been completely ruined.

Zheng Dafu shouted angrily, “You noisy brat, keep it up, and I’ll lose the game and drag Lingjun Ge into the mess, then you’ll have to pay!”

Pei Qian sprinted off, not stopping, “Pay what? Are you not a proper person?”

Pei Qian continued to hum her folk tune.

Zhou Mili, following closely behind Pei Qian, asked curiously, “What song is this? I’ve never heard it before.”

Pei Qian stopped and crossed her arms, “It’s a song from my hometown. It’s a pity it’s so well written but hasn’t spread.”

Zhou Mili felt that there was something off about Pei Qian’s words and frowned, pondering deeply.

Zhu Lian was waiting for the letter from Cui Dongshan and also had to wait for Lu Baixiang to arrive at Dilapidated Mountain. After participating in Wei Ban’s Divine Night Tour Feast, he would go treasure hunting with Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island.

Unlike what was mentioned in the letter to Chen Ping'an, after receiving Cui Dongshan’s reply, Zhu Lian no longer needed to worry about the Great Li iron cavalry and spies; Cui Dongshan would handle it properly. He should have taken the exiled princess back to her homeland.

However, Zhu Lian still warned Liu Chongrun of the inherent dangers, advising against pursuing the water palace dragon boat. After weighing the pros and cons, Liu Chongrun gritted his teeth and decided not to pursue it any further. Only then did Zhu Lian give Liu Chongrun a few days' break before he casually visited the Scallop Fish Back, cheerfully announcing that things had changed. Dilapidated Mountain had decided to bear some of the risks, so both sides could actually give it a try. However, the profit sharing could no longer be a 50-50 split; Dilapidated Mountain had to take 20 percent more. After some bargaining, it became a 60-40 split between Scallop Fish Back and Dilapidated Mountain.

Zhu Lian didn’t truly want that extra 1% of profit; when he and Lu Baixiang accompanied Liu Chongrun on their treasure hunt, he had a reason to say that their distant mountain lord had replied and instructed him to follow the original plan of a 50-50 split.

At that time, everything would seem as usual, returning to where it was.

Of course, this wasn’t just Zhu Lian’s busy work for nothing.

When the Divine Night Tour Feast officially took place at Piyun Mountain.

Pei Qian and Zhou Mili didn’t attend the feast, as Pei Qian was busy copying more books to avoid falling too far behind due to her boxing practice.

Interestingly, even Chen Lingjun didn’t go to join the fun this time.

However, his brother, the River God of Yujiang, later made a special trip to Dilapidated Mountain to ask Chen Lingjun why he didn’t show up.

After that, Zhu Lian and Lu Baixiang went down the mountain to handle business. Liu Chongrun was worried and felt uncertain about the future, knowing that fortune and misfortune were intertwined, especially since they were digging for treasure right under the noses of the Great Li iron cavalry.

Lu Baixiang’s two disciples, Yuan Bao and Yuan Lai, brother and sister, stayed up on Dilapidated Mountain.

The two got along well with Cen Yuanji, who had been brought up the mountain by Zhu Lian.

The lively play outside the bamboo house three days after was worlds apart from the practice inside the bamboo house.

Zhou Mili, carrying her hiking stick, stood guard on the path leading from the estate to the bamboo house, not allowing anyone to visit the bamboo house.

This was the instruction given by Zhu Lian, and Zhou Mili didn’t dare to leave her post. However, as long as Chen Ruchu finished her tasks, she would come and gossip with Zhou Mili, sharing snacks. When it was time to do something else, Chen Ruchu would leave.

Zhou Mili obediently squatted in the circle Pei Qian had drawn for her earlier.

At first, Zhou Mili felt wronged, thinking that Pei Qian had drawn the circle too small, making her position as the right protector of the dilapidated mountain seem insufficiently grand.

Pei Qian asked her if those door gods pasted on the doors in the Longqi Lane of the mountain had a circle as big as the one under her feet? Would those door gods complain? Pei Qian then asked sternly, “Zhou Mili, are you getting a bit too proud with this right protector title?”

Zhou Mili quickly shook her head.

Zhou Mili squatted alone in the circle, inch by inch, moving around the nonexistent boundary.

Every time the little girl in black, carrying her hiking stick, took a step, a small figure sprang up from the ground behind her, following her a few steps.

On the second floor of the bamboo house.

Cui Cheng placed his foot heavily on Pei Qian’s forehead, twisting it roughly, and looked down at her, “Before today’s boxing practice, how dare you ask me when boxing will have an end?”

Cui Cheng kicked Pei Qian on the side of her temple, then turned to the girl curled up by the wall, “You can talk once you reach the dead end.”

Pei Qian, who had just spent the previous moment gathering herself, stood up unsteadily, bloodied and disheveled. With a mouth wide open and head tilted, she extended two fingers and wiggled one of her teeth, then gave it a hard pull, extracting it.

She carefully tucked the bloodied tooth away in her sleeve. Her master had once said that every child grows up, and during this time, one should toss any fallen teeth onto the roof to make a wish for safety.

Pei Qian bent at the waist, fists clenched, gently tightening and relaxing, staring intently at Cui Cheng.

With a swift movement, she launched herself off the ground, soaring into the air, and landed a powerful kick against the wall of the bamboo house, her body shooting forward like an arrow. Midway, she suddenly fell, twisting her ankle and sliding a few steps off course. With her stance wide open, she threw a punch at Cui Cheng, executing the God’s Drum style.

Pei Qian might not know that the God’s Drum style was the minimal stance her master used when confronting Cui Cheng.

Because he knew it was the least effective.

However, Pei Qian was the opposite; this punch was the most she could offer to the old man.

Time and again, returning with nothing, time and again, she threw another punch.

When the old man’s fist struck her head, unexpectedly, at the moment Pei Qian’s body flew back, she kicked out fiercely.

Clearly, she had the intention of “you hit me, I’ll kick you back” from the beginning.

Unfortunately, Cui Cheng caught her ankle with one hand, lifting her high before smashing her down heavily.

Pei Qian’s body curled up as she was hit, her breath alternating rapidly in that brief moment, a natural response.

Cui Cheng scoffed, “You’re such a waste that even Chen Ping'an can’t compare to you. If I were that great waste, I’d still disdain you for wasting my resources at the Dilapidated Mountain! You think you can cling to me? Do you think I’m Cen Yuanji, who practices boxing as if it were a nap? Want to come again? Don’t play dead; if you can get even a thread of my clothes, I’ll take your surname!”

Pei Qian banged her elbow heavily on the ground, her body soaring into the air, standing firmly, intermittently mumbling and incoherently saying, “No need to take my surname... Just take my master’s... But I have to see if he agrees.”

Cui Cheng stepped in front of Pei Qian, one hand behind his back, the other gripping her face, then took a step forward, slamming her against the wall.

Her limbs fell limply.

Cui Cheng released his grip, and Pei Qian sat weakly on the ground, leaning against the wall, a large smear of blood streaking down from her forehead on the wall.

Cui Cheng coldly laughed, “A scaredy-cat like Chen Ping'an would raise a scaredy-cat like you. You two should spend your lives in Muddled Bottle Lane, picking up chicken dung and dog feces! Chen Ping'an must be blind to have chosen you, Pei Qian, as his so-called first disciple—doomed to be a pathetic bug hiding behind him, and you dare to talk about ‘discipleship’ and ‘founding’?”

Pei Qian’s fingers moved slightly, and she finally struggled to raise her head, her lips moving.

But she was stepped on the forehead by the old man, who bent down and tilted his head, “What are you saying, little waste? I beg you to speak louder! Are you saying I’m right? You and Chen Ping'an should spend your lives dealing with chicken dung and dog feces?! How about you use your hiking stick to pick up that chicken dung and let Chen Ping'an carry it in a dustpan? That’s best; you won’t have to practice boxing for too long. When Chen Ping'an rolls back to the dilapidated mountain, you two, both big and small wastes, can just stay in Muddled Bottle Lane.”

Sitting on the ground, Pei Qian slowly raised her hand, swinging a punch toward Cui Cheng’s foot.

The old man pulled his foot back, and after her punch missed, he switched to another kick, heavily stepping down on Pei Qian’s head.

Moments later, Pei Qian switched hands and threw another punch.

Only then did the old man retreat a few steps, clicking his tongue, “With this kind of skill, it seems you can go to Fortune Street or Peach Leaf Lane with that waste Chen Ping'an to wipe boots for the wealthy lords. Once Chen Ping'an wipes their boots clean, you, as his disciple, can smile and bow, welcoming them back.”

Pei Qian pressed her hands against the wall, slowly pushing herself up, straining to open her eyes, opening her mouth, but ultimately couldn’t make a sound.

The old man, however, smiled, knowing exactly what the little girl was cursing him for.

Pei Qian bent down, breathing lightly, her vision blurry; she could hardly see anything.

The old man turned to walk toward the bamboo door, glancing back, “I’ll open the door now, and you can write to that Chen Ping'an, saying that you, as his disciple, can finally share some of the burdens with your master and have thought of a great idea for you two to make money together! After all, Chen Ping'an is from a muddy background; with a useless disciple like you, making money from this kind of lowly work, poor or not, what can he do? I see no way out!”

In a flash.

Cui Cheng halted, narrowing his eyes.

Almost fainting, Pei Qian instinctively widened her eyes, swaying a step forward. The next time her body swayed even more, she disappeared after several steps.

With a step, she dashed out, suddenly leaping high and pouncing down, throwing a punch at Cui Cheng’s head.

Like the boy in the grass shoe from the town, swift as a hawk, soaring over the stream.

Cui Cheng hesitated for a moment but ultimately turned his shoulder to evade Pei Qian’s punch. However, this time, the old man didn’t counter, only turning to see the little girl collapsed near the door, already fainted.

Perhaps she was trying to block him from opening the door?

Cui Cheng came to the girl’s side, sat cross-legged, gently pressing down on her bleeding little head, nodding with a smile, “Very good.”

 ### Chapter 659: What Moves the Heart Most on the Mountain

Yuan Lai had always preferred reading over martial arts. It wasn't that he couldn’t endure hardship or pain; he simply wasn’t as obsessed with martial arts as his sister. 

Following their master, Lu Baixiang, they returned to the dilapidated mountain once more, but he and his sister still hadn’t managed to etch their names into the ancestral hall's records. This was because the young mountain lord wasn’t present at the peak, which didn’t bother Yuan Lai too much, though his sister Yuan Bao was quite indignant, feeling that their master had been neglected.

Each day, Yuan Lai practiced his punches and stances alongside his sister, and whenever he had free time, he would read. This displeased Yuan Bao, who privately lectured Yuan Lai about the importance of cherishing their chance to study under such a master. Yuan Lai listened but wanted to express his own ideas. However, when he saw his sister’s stern expression and the wooden spear she gripped tightly, he dared not speak up.

The wooden spear was the only relic left behind by their father, a former escort master. In Yuan Bao's eyes, it was a family heirloom meant for Yuan Lai. She believed he was too soft-hearted and lacked the fighting spirit to wield it. Their father had died in the martial world, and as children of the Jianghu, they were expected to reclaim their family honor within it. Yet, Yuan Lai chose to read every day—what sort of behavior was that?

Yuan Bao preferred the bustling and strictly regimented true martial sect, once the stronghold of a demonic sect in the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Their master had first gathered a group of border bandits and horse thieves, later attracting many hidden talents, some elderly and scholarly, who could savor coarse meals and cheap wine while remaining at ease, while others, dressed plainly, would hesitate for long before they could touch a feast. Some silent men would shed tears at the sight of a single sword.

Yuan Lai liked the dilapidated mountain.

Because there was a girl there named Cen Yuanji.

Like his sister Yuan Bao, she practiced martial arts diligently, but she was more beautiful and gentle. 

He knew that Cen Yuanji walked the mountain steps twice daily, so he timed his strolls to the mountain god's shrine accordingly, arriving early to wander around before sitting on the steps to read. 

Tonight, under the moonlight, Yuan Lai sat on the top step reading. In about half an hour, Cen Yuanji would walk up from her practice. She usually rested for a while before descending the mountain. Sometimes she would ask him what book he was reading, and he would share the details he had prepared in advance—book title, where he bought it, and what it was about. Cen Yuanji never seemed to tire of listening; she would gaze at him intently, and when he caught a glimpse of her eyes, he could hardly look away, yet he found it impossible not to steal another glance.

Cen Yuanji's eyes were like the bright moon.

There was only one moon in the world; anyone could raise their head to see it, and it wasn’t special.

But the brightness in Cen Yuanji’s eyes was something only Yuan Lai could see, and only he could gently discern it.

For some reason tonight, Cen Yuanji was accompanied by a sister, practicing the basic stances together as they climbed the mountain.

Yuan Lai felt somewhat awkward, restless, worried that his straightforward sister would criticize him for not being serious in front of Cen Yuanji. Would she still ask him about his reading after that?

When Yuan Bao and Cen Yuanji reached the mountaintop, they paused their practice, the two girls, each beautiful in their own right, chatting and laughing. Yet, if one were to judge purely by looks, Cen Yuanji undoubtedly surpassed Yuan Bao.

Yuan Bao and Cen Yuanji had sparred privately before, each having won and lost in turn. They had agreed to strive together in the future towards the legendary Golden Body Realm.

Yuan Lai sat nearby, unable to read, unwilling to leave, his face slightly flushed, listening attentively to Cen Yuanji's clear and pleasant voice, feeling utterly satisfied.

The two girls sat side by side, with Yuan Bao discussing her master’s profound martial arts knowledge, showcasing her talents in various arts—music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, demonstrating her vast knowledge.

Cen Yuanji spoke highly of Mr. Zhu, describing him as kind and approachable, who prepared a feast of delicious dishes.

Yuan Lai looked down and saw three little girls. The tallest among them was a peculiar girl named Pei Qian, who was particularly boisterous. She had no reservations when speaking to their master and the elder Zhu Lian, showing remarkable boldness. Later, when Yuan Lai asked his master, he learned that Pei Qian was the mountain lord's top disciple, who had traveled far with their master and the others from their hometown to reach the dilapidated mountain.

The little girl in a pink skirt who could conjure a handful of seeds was known as Chen Ruchu, although she said it was fine to call her Nuan Shu, explaining that the name derived from a poetic line. The other girl, clad in black with a hiking staff, was naive and, upon their first meeting, had asked Yuan Lai if he had ever heard of the Mute Lake in North Ju Lu Prefecture, and whether he knew about the great water monster there.

Cen Yuanji felt a bit intimidated by Pei Qian.

Yuan Bao was not keen on mingling with these small mountain groups. Chen Ruchu was an acceptable child, but the other two, Yuan Bao found it hard to like, thinking they behaved like two children with their heads stuck in the door. The dilapidated mountain, along with Qilong Alley, wasn’t heavily populated, yet there were already three small groups—Zhu Lian, the Great Li North Peak God Wei Bo, and the gatekeeper Zheng Dafeng. Over time, Yuan Bao felt that these three were anything but ordinary.

Pei Qian’s group could barely be considered a small mountain faction.

The shopkeeper of the New Year’s shop in Qilong Alley, Shi Rou, seemed closer to the three disciples of the grass-roots shop.

The girl who preferred to dress in blue, Chen Lingjun, tended to keep to herself, not fitting in with any of the groups.

Yuan Bao had inquired Cen Yuanji about the young mountain lord, but Cen Yuanji couldn’t provide a clear answer. She only said he wasn’t a bad person, lacked any airs of a mountain lord, and preferred to be hands-off, traveling far and wide, leaving Zhu Lian to handle all the matters.

Pei Qian didn’t quite get along with Yuan Bao and Yuan Lai. She played outside the mountain god’s shrine with Chen Ruchu and Zhou Milin. If Yuan Bao and Cen Yuanji weren’t around, the mountain water colleagues would tease the so-called “Golden-Head Mountain God” Song Yuzhang, who would share amusing tales from the mountains he heard from the old cook and Piyun Mountain. Song Yuzhang would recount trivial matters from his past as a dragon kiln supervisor, while Pei Qian loved to hear about such mundane stories.

Some distance from Yuan Bao and the others, Zhou Milin suddenly stood on tiptoe and whispered in Pei Qian’s ear, “I think that girl named Yuan Bao is a bit silly.”

Pei Qian glared, “As the right protector of the dilapidated mountain, how can you speak ill of others behind their backs?!”

Zhou Milin looked a bit weak.

Pei Qian chuckled, “Silly or not, do we really need to say it? We all know it already.”

Zhou Milin smiled broadly.

Pei Qian reached out to pat Zhou Milin’s little head, bending slightly, her gaze soft. “You eat so many rice grains each day, bowl after bowl, how come you’re not growing taller?”

Zhou Milin puffed out her chest, standing on her toes.

Pei Qian gently pressed her down, comforting her, “Aiming high doesn’t always mean being tall.”

Zhou Milin beamed with delight.

Pei Qian cupped Zhou Milin’s cheeks in her hands and playfully closed her mouth, reminding her, “Milin, you’re already the right protector of our dilapidated mountain! Everyone, from Mountain God Song to Gatekeeper Zheng, and even the two big shops in Qilong Alley, all know your position. The higher you rise, the more you must reflect on yourself every day. You can’t let your tail stick up and embarrass our master, understand?”

Chen Ruchu looked toward the gray mountains in the north, which also belonged to their group and were very large. Now, the Crab Fish back had been rented out to the Book Simplifying Lake's Pearl Hairpin Island.

Chen Ruchu softly said, “Mr. Zhu seems to be gone for quite a while this time.”

Pei Qian nodded, “He’s traveling to many places. I heard he’s going as far as the southernmost Old Dragon City in Baoping Prefecture.”

Pei Qian pulled out a money pouch from her sleeve. “The Aunt Gui who sent me this money pouch is a celestial elder from Old Dragon City. She has a really beautiful smile.”

Zhou Milin asked, “Can I take a look?”

Pei Qian handed it over. “Don’t go rummaging through it; it’s filled with treasures worth a fortune.”

Zhou Milin took the money pouch. “It’s really heavy.”

Pei Qian smirked, “That’s called family wealth!”

Pei Qian jumped onto the railing at the mountain peak, mimicking her master, slowly throwing punches, moving like flowing clouds.

Every sudden halt and flick of her sleeve sounded like muffled thunder.

With a slight stomp, the entire railing shook, sending dust scattering.

Unfortunately, the three down the stone stairs had already descended the mountain.

A group of people took the ferry from Niu Jiao Mountain, just leaving the old Great Li territory to go towards the central region of Baoping Prefecture.

Now, most of Baoping had the surname Song.

Liu Chongrun was seated at a dressing table in her room, applying makeup while holding a facial mask sent over by Zhu Lian. She was in a mixed state of amusement and despair. 

She thought about the treasure hunt that was coming up, feeling restless. After all, as a former princess who had once ruled over her country, finding the water palace and dragon boat was easy, but bringing them back to Longquan County was a monumental challenge. However, since Zhu Lian said that the mountain man had brilliant plans, Liu Chongrun decided to take it step by step, trusting that the accountant from Qingxia Island, who had willingly handed over the authority of the dilapidated mountain, wasn’t the braggart type.

In Lu Baixiang's room, Zhu Lian sat cross-legged with a jar of wine, a porcelain cup, and a plate of roasted soybeans, sipping slowly.

Lu Baixiang sat opposite him, showing no intention of drinking.

In a letter from Cui Dongshan, it mentioned Wei Xian, stating that he had climbed up from being a soldier to assisting a military commander named Cao Jun, accumulating considerable military merit. He had already received the martial official title from the Great Li court and would be transferring to a civilian official role, thus gaining a foothold.

The four from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land had each chosen their own paths.

Wei Xian had joined the army, Sui You was cultivating in the Yu Gui Sect in Tongyezhou, while Lu Baixiang was establishing his own sect in the Jianghu. Only Zhu Lian remained at the dilapidated mountain.

After receiving a secret letter from Zhu Lian, Lu Baixiang had prepared three treasures from the mountain and a box of celestial money, all a mix of buy-back money from the remnants of the Zhu Ying Dynasty. However, later, when Chen Ping'an sent a letter back from the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven, Zhu Lian not only refused to accept Lu Baixiang's hard-earned savings but also returned him ten grains of Gu Yu coins. At the same time, he advised Lu Baixiang to gather various troops but cautioned against getting involved with the remnants of the fallen dynasty. The Great Li iron cavalry was likely to target those who still sought to revive their former state. Chen Ping'an had only suggested; he hadn’t insisted on how Lu Baixiang should act.

When discussing the treasure hunt with Liu Chongrun, Lu Baixiang was present, but it was Zhu Lian who was tactically orchestrating everything.

Zhu Lian was reaping multiple benefits.

He was helping the dilapidated mountain determine whether Liu Chongrun and Pearl Hairpin Island were worth establishing a long-term partnership.

Pearl Hairpin Island owed the dilapidated mountain a significant amount of incense.

Liu Chongrun also owed Chen Ping'an, the young mountain lord, a share of the account.

Of course, the dilapidated mountain, along with Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian, had no intention of coveting these debts of incense; if Liu Chongrun and Pearl Hairpin Island showed any goodwill in business in the future, the dilapidated mountain would find ways to repay it elsewhere.

It was believed that Liu Chongrun still didn’t quite realize that her ability to stay at the Crab Fish back to cultivate was entirely contingent on her own thoughts.

If her greed for profit led her to take risks after learning about the dangers of the treasure hunt, it wouldn’t be the current situation anymore.

Lu Baixiang chuckled, “If Liu Chongrun chooses poorly, will you, Zhu Lian, be overreaching? If you find out Liu Chongrun isn’t a suitable ally, what about the water palace and dragon boat that should have been the dilapidated mountain’s? Should we take them or not? If we don’t take them, we lose fifty percent of the share for nothing. If we do take them, we deepen our ties with Liu Chongrun and Pearl Hairpin Island, leading to endless troubles for the dilapidated mountain.”

Zhu Lian picked a few golden roasted soybeans and popped them into his mouth, crunching them gleefully as he smiled, “‘If’? That ‘if’ doesn’t exist now, does it?”

Lu Baixiang shook his head, evidently unconvinced by Zhu Lian’s reasoning.

If it were him overseeing this matter, when Cui Dongshan’s letter arrived at the dilapidated mountain, the situation would have been settled. Either the water palace or the dragon boat would be cleanly transported to the dilapidated mountain. As for everything else, Liu Chongrun and the Pearl Hairpin Island’s cultivators’ future rights and wrongs would be trivial matters. Lu Baixiang firmly believed that the rapid development of the dilapidated mountain would soon make the cultivators from Pearl Hairpin Island look up to them, and they wouldn’t dare to make mistakes. Even if they thought they had made a significant mistake, it would just be a minor error easily smoothed over by Lu Baixiang.

Zhu Lian took a sip of wine, savoring it, and then teasingly said, “Just be at ease and play your role as the demonic sect leader; don’t worry about this trivial matter of soybeans.”

Lu Baixiang chuckled, “If they ever need to fight for their lives, I’ll trouble you for assistance.”

Zhu Lian laughed, “As for Yuan Bao, it’s hard to say what she will become in the future. But if Yuan Lai wants to break through a bottleneck, I do have a clever plan.”

Lu Baixiang said, “These three treasures from the mountain, I’ll gift them to you in my personal capacity. As for how you, Zhu Lian, handle them—whether it’s to bolster the dilapidated mountain’s resources or for your personal collection, that’s up to you.”

Zhu Lian took a sip of wine. “Is that settled?”

Lu Baixiang nodded.

Zhu Lian then proposed, “In the future, in front of Yuan Lai, let Pei Qian land a punch that nearly knocks Cen Yuanji out—that would be perfect!”

Lu Baixiang burst into hearty laughter.

Zhu Lian pushed the remaining roasted soybeans toward Lu Baixiang, “It feels bad to always be taking from our own people. Luckily, you, Leader Lu, are righteous and have given me the chance to patch up one wall by tearing down another. I’ll take one of these to give to Chen Lingjun. Over the past year, he’s been gambling and losing nearly everything.”

Lu Baixiang recalled the proud little boy dressed in blue and chuckled, “He’s just asking for trouble.”

Zhu Lian remarked, “Having a bit of pride is a good thing.”

Lu Baixiang looked at him, his expression playful.

Zhu Lian confidently said, “It’s not my fault that Wei Dashan has no sense of shame; what does that have to do with me?”

Lu Baixiang smiled and reached out to pick up a roasted soybean.

Suddenly, Zhu Lian changed his tone, “That’s not very righteous. If we’re calculating carefully, it’s really Brother Dafeng who has a thick skin; I and Brother Wei are the ones who feel embarrassed every day.”

A charming figure in white with gold earrings appeared behind Zhu Lian, pressing down on his shoulder. With the other hand, he gently reached for the table, revealing a painting the size of a writing tablet, depicting a hunchbacked man sitting on a small stool at the mountain gate, basking in the sun and digging at his toes, extending his middle finger toward Zhu Lian. Zhu Lian exclaimed in surprise, leaning forward on the table, quickly raising the wine jug, smiling ingratiatingly, “Brother Dafeng! It’s been too long; I’ve missed you! Come, let’s have a good drink together.”

Zheng Dafeng continued to extend his middle finger, as if telling him to leave.

Zhu Lian ignored him, turning to complain to Wei Bo, “Why don’t you use your powers to bring Brother Dafeng a jug of wine?”

Wei Bo waved his sleeve, and a jug of wine floated from the dilapidated mountain, landing in Zheng Dafeng's hands.

With one hand holding the painting and the other the wine jug, Zhu Lian stood up and departed, drinking as he walked, exchanging farewell sentiments with Zheng Dafeng, the two of them sharing a drink across countless mountains and rivers.

Lu Baixiang smiled, gesturing for the mountain god to take a seat.

Wei Bo didn’t leave but didn’t sit either, placing a hand on the armrest of his chair, smiling, “I need to visit Zhongyue to see the new mountain lord; I’ll be passing by.”

Lu Baixiang questioned, “Isn’t that against the rules of the mountains?”

Generally, the sovereign gods of the five mountains of the secular empire wouldn’t easily meet.

Wei Bo chuckled, “During the three night banquet feasts, the lord of Zhongyue is close to the border of my North Peak. It’s only appropriate to attend at least one. Since the other party is busy, I’ll visit. Additionally, the former official of Longquan County, Wu Yuan, is now a county magistrate near Zhongyue Mountain. I can catch up with him. There’s also Mr. Xu of the Mo family who lives next to Zhongyue Mountain. We are old acquaintances from the previous night banquet. He asked me to deliver a gift to Piyun Mountain, and I should thank him in person.”

Lu Baixiang nodded; it made sense.

The Great Li iron cavalry had swept south, destroying countless vassal states of the empire and abolishing thousands of small shrines, shattering countless golden body statues.

Wei Bo, the North Peak deity, was the only mountain lord to receive over a hundred gold coins from the Great Li Ministry of Revenue.

The other four new mountain lords in Baoping had not yet received such distinguished treatment.

At his place, Zhu Lian drank with Zheng Dafeng. Although the ferry was still in the North Peak territory, this painting created by Wei Bo wouldn’t last long.

Zhu Lian asked, “Is something up?”

Zheng Dafeng nodded and said, “Old Cui suddenly wants to take Pei Qian to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. I didn’t refuse, but I also didn’t agree immediately. I can only say that Wei Bo isn’t at Piyun Mountain right now, and even with the Tongye Umbrella, it’s impossible to enter.”

Zhu Lian contemplated for a moment and said solemnly, “The longer we delay in agreeing, the better. We must wait until the young master returns to the dilapidated mountain before discussing it. If we allow this trip to happen now, Old Cui’s spirit will be completely shattered.”

Zheng Dafeng scratched his head and sighed, “Do we really need Chen Ping’an to meet him one last time? I feel it would only add to the sorrow of parting. Old Cui’s intentional timing for this request likely has his own motives.”

Zhu Lian helplessly said, “It’s still better to meet once.”

Zheng Dafeng asked, “What about the compensation matter?”

Zhu Lian shook his head, “Not a word about it.”

Zheng Dafeng sat on a small stool, gazing at the distant mountain gate, enjoying the warm spring sun and drinking wine, savoring the moment.

What moves the heart most on the mountain is the blooming apricot blossoms of February.

With a limp, he climbed to the peak, gazing at the small town to the east and the county city to the north, where sparse lanterns flickered in the moonlight.

Zheng Dafeng enjoyed spending such quiet days, one after another.

Moreover, he looked forward to more people settling in the future at the dilapidated mountain.

If there were more water spirits, that would be even better.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “You should keep an eye on things over there.”

Zheng Dafeng raised his wine jug, pointing toward the mountain gate, “Isn’t that what I’m doing? If a mother fly sneaks up the mountain, that’s me not doing my job!”

---

**Shizi Peak, the Immortal’s Cave.**

Chen Ping’an lay bloodied and near death on a small boat. Li Er paddled back to the ferry, saying, “Your punches are fast enough, but you still lack in power. I suspect you’ve been too focused on speed, thinking a few punches can decide life and death. In a martial fight, it sounds straightforward, but it’s really not that simple. If you get stuck in a deadlock, you’ll only be on a downward slope; that’s not how it should be.”

Chen Ping’an nodded slightly, indicating that he understood.

After the first feeding of punches, Li Er had noticed the flaws in Chen Ping’an’s intent. The second time, he allowed Chen Ping’an to throw a hundred punches without countering, then returned a single punch without using much force, with only one requirement: he had to stay upright. After that, Chen Ping’an had to maintain his pure true energy without dropping it while throwing another hundred punches, and if Chen Ping’an couldn’t muster a breath to exploit any openings Li Er intentionally exposed, Li Er wouldn’t hold back. That one punch, even for a martial artist at the traveling realm, would feel like a fate worse than death.

Today was the third feeding of punches, and Li Er switched up his strategy. They each threw punches, with Chen Ping’an putting in all his effort. When Li Er halted his punches halfway, he asked Chen Ping’an how many times he had died.

After Chen Ping’an provided a precise answer, Li Er nodded, affirming it, and then rewarded him with a punch from the tenth realm, sending Chen Ping’an flying from one end of the mirror to the other, emphasizing that in a battle of life and death, you must forget about life and death and not get caught up in unnecessary thoughts. Fortunately, this punch, like the last, only landed on Chen Ping’an’s shoulder.

Soaking in a medicinal barrel, what did it matter if he suffered? Regenerating bones was the real test of endurance, and during this time, a pure martial artist must intentionally amplify their perceptions, delving deeply into the growth of bones, muscles, and flesh, to gain even a small skill.

A crude thatched hut had been built at the ferry, and Chen Ping’an was currently healing there.

Li Er felt that he had been quite restrained in feeding punches, ensuring he didn’t hit Chen Ping’an so hard that he needed several days to recuperate. Each day, even when Chen Ping’an finished healing, he would still carry a lingering “pain debt.” In the second feeding, injuries piled upon injuries, requiring Chen Ping’an to stabilize his intent for every punch, which meant maintaining his peak intent despite gradually weakening physical strength.

Li Er didn’t mention what would happen if he couldn’t do it.

Regardless, Chen Ping’an managed.

Things in the world aren’t that complicated.

As for whether this approach would work with someone else, Li Er had never considered it.

Firstly, he was too lazy to teach, and secondly, with one punch, Chen Ping’an could endure without serious harm, allowing for the next feeding. The average person would just die—what was there to teach?

Li Er didn’t comment on whether Chen Ping’an was good or bad at it.

In the end, how much he could endure was entirely up to Chen Ping’an.

Li Er paddled to the ferry, where Chen Ping’an had already struggled to sit up.

Li Er said the feeding of punches was coming to a pause, urging not to rush, and it was better to wait a few days.

Moreover, he needed to head down the mountain to check on the shop.

Chen Ping’an asked if he could stay at the foot of the mountain for a day or two after he healed.

Li Er chuckled, “What’s the big deal? Just treat it like your own home.”

Li Er was the first to head down the mountain.

Chen Ping’an squatted by the ferry, enduring not only the pain from his injuries but also the turmoil within his soul. He gently slapped the boat's bow, and the small boat suddenly sank into the water before bobbing back up. This back-and-forth was enough to clean the blood inside the boat.

Only then did he head to the thatched hut, where he needed to fetch water to boil. Each step was a torment.

By the next morning, Chen Ping’an changed into clean clothes and descended Shizi Peak.

The fabric shop had just opened, and after having breakfast, he helped Aunt Liu attract customers.

The woman was astonished, realizing that she had learned quite a bit of business acumen from a younger generation.

Some neighbors who had previously quarreled with her now greeted her with smiles on the street.

While the woman was both pleased and troubled, she couldn’t help but think, how could such a good young man not be her son-in-law?

So, when Li Liu returned home a bit late, she found the young man enthusiastically selling cloth to customers.

Li Liu was taken aback.

As soon as she crossed the threshold, her mother discreetly pinched her slender waist, not putting too much force into it since she was her daughter, not her man. The woman complained, “You useless thing.”

Li Liu smiled, her eyes squinting with joy, always the obedient Li Huai sister when at home.

With Chen Ping’an helping draw in business and Li Liu overseeing the shop, the woman felt at ease to head to the back kitchen to cook, while Li Er sat on a small stool, blowing the fire with a bamboo tube.

While the store was momentarily empty of customers, Chen Ping’an walked over to the counter, softly saying to Li Liu, who was calculating behind it, “It seems I’ve caused Aunt Liu to misunderstand; I’m sorry. But Uncle Li has already helped clarify things.”

Li Liu looked up, smiling, “It’s nothing.”

Chen Ping’an sighed in relief.

He hesitated for a moment, lowering his voice to ask, “Can I ask you something?”

Li Liu gently tapped her abacus, her eyes flitting over her mother’s seemingly incomprehensible accounts, smiling as she said, “I don’t like Lin Shouyi or Dong Shuijing.”

Chen Ping’an was a bit surprised, thinking that Li Liu would at least prefer one of them.

But preferences don’t always follow logic.

Li Liu smiled and asked, “The reason you didn’t stay on Shizi Peak is that you feel like no one recognizes you here, it feels more like your childhood home? And now, your hometown town feels very strange?”

Chen Ping’an leaned against the counter, looking out at the street, nodding.

Li Liu fell silent.

After a brief pause, she closed the account book, smiling, “I’ve earned three taels of silver more.”

Chen Ping’an remained leaning against the counter, hands tucked into his sleeves, smiling, “In business, I have more talent than in pottery.”

Li Liu asked, “Have you heard about the incident with Qingliang Sect?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I saw it in the news on the ferry to Shizi Peak.”

After dinner, Chen Ping’an took his leave to head back up the mountain, opting not to rest at Li Huai’s house for the night.

The woman sighed softly, turning to see Li Liu still standing there, poking her daughter’s forehead with her finger, “What are you dawdling for? Send the guest off!”

Li Liu looked toward Li Er.

Li Er remained as still as a mountain.

The woman sighed again, muttering to herself, “Oh well, a forced melon isn’t sweet.”

Li Liu beamed, and Li Er grinned.

The woman glared at Li Liu, “Li Huai goes with me; you go with your father.”

Upon reaching the summit of Shizi Peak, Chen Ping’an walked past the mountain’s restrictions into the thatched hut, closed his eyes to meditate for a moment, then rose to head to the ferry, paddling out onto the lake’s mirror-like surface, leaving his boots on the small boat and rolling up his sleeves and pants to practice punching like the mountain peak.

 ### Chapter 660: A Jug of Wine and a Plate of Dishes

A group of women and young girls were washing clothes by the water's edge, where the mountains met the stream. The gentle flow of the creek was framed by the lush pine and cypress trees on the hills above.

The woman known as Aunt Liu (Liu Shanshan), referred to by Chen Pingan, was spreading clothes out to dry on the blue stone slabs by the creek alongside her daughter, Li Liu.

At the foot of Lion Peak (Shizi Feng), there was a small town with four to five hundred households. It seemed to border Lion Peak, yet there was a distinct separation, like heaven and earth, with little interaction between the two. Over the centuries, both sides had grown accustomed to this divide. Besides, the mountain path to Lion Peak was somewhat distant from the town. Even the most mischievous of children would only dare to run to the foot of the mountain and stop there; who would be brave enough to offend the celestial beings cultivating their immortality up there? If they did, their elders would drag them back home and punish them hard enough to make them cry.

In this small town, those who were well-known were either families with members employed at the county office, those who had earned a fortune and built lavish homes upon returning, or families with children who were studious. Then there were the flirty widows and women like Aunt Liu, who ran shops and dealt with customers. In the bustling market, sharp-tongued women often didn’t receive any mercy in return. Over time, they all came to know Aunt Liu by name. The women of the town used to make light of her frequent claims that her son was studying at a prestigious academy; few believed her. Not even the women were willing to accept whether she had given birth to a proper son or not. What good was having a beautiful daughter if she was already married off, like water spilled from a bucket? If she truly had such a lovely daughter, they would envy her greatly. It was rumored that the daughter had gone to Lion Peak to serve some old immortal as a maid. If she also had a son with hopes of achieving fame, it would mean she had taken all the fortune for herself; how could they live with that? Could their hearts ever feel at ease?

Recently, a young man who appeared quite familiar had come to the fabric shop, helping to fetch water several times. He was courteous and seemed to be well-educated, with a fair amount of strength. He also helped some elderly women draw water and remembered faces; after chatting with them just once, he could greet them warmly the next day. When he first arrived in town, he brought quite a few gifts. It was heard that he was a distant relative of Li Muga (Li's family), but the women thought he didn’t quite look the part. Most likely, he was the sweetheart of Li Liu. Some better-off women even went to the shop to see for themselves. As it turned out, not only did they find no fault with the young man, but they also ended up spending a fair amount of silver, buying quite a bit of fabric and muttering at home about the wasteful spending of their husbands.

If that young man had been a smooth talker, merely helping the shop to earn a dishonest profit, it would have sufficed. They could band together and gossip behind Aunt Liu's back about how she had found such a poor match for her daughter, who was unworthy of any attention. However, after a few complaints about their husbands, they would return and examine the fabric; the prices were not cheap, but they were fair enough. They had all grown accustomed to the dealings of daily life, so how could they judge good from bad? The young man helped them select cotton and silk fabrics, never steering them towards the more expensive options. If he really had an eye for quality, he wouldn’t let them overspend. He had a keen eye, choosing fabrics that suited their figures, clothing styles, and hair accessories. The women with daughters agreed that the fabrics made them look several years younger, and the prices were reasonable; it was clear that a discount had been given.

Thus, the women did not think poorly of Aunt Liu for having found a son-in-law that seemed too good for their station. After all, he did not dress ostentatiously nor carry himself with the airs of wealthy scholars. When conversing, he maintained eye contact and did not have a shifty gaze, a quality much valued in the marketplace.

So, while Aunt Liu's family had chosen such a son-in-law, they wouldn’t be envied by their neighbors, but they had to admit that the young man was decent and capable of living a long life ahead.

Though other families might find their sons-in-law lacking, they were not too bad either, which brought about a subtle difference in the women’s hearts.

Li Liu listened to her mother chat happily with others while she pounded clothes, drifting off into her thoughts, contemplating how small matters could lead to bigger ones. The small matters were happening at the shop and in the town, while the larger matters extended beyond a single world.

In this lifetime, she found herself in the Liji Cave (Lizhu Dongtian), a result of careful planning by the Yang family. She understood that this time would be different; otherwise, she wouldn't be so close to the Yang family’s shop. In fact, it was true. Years ago, she had accompanied her father, Li Er, to the shop, where Li Er worked as a helper while she went to the back courtyard. It was the first time old Yang had spoken sternly to her, telling her that if she continued to cultivate in the same way as before—changing identities and rushing up the mountain, merely to circle around at the summit—if she kept accumulating lifetimes worth of practice over a thousand years, she would still be nothing more than a half-hearted practitioner who couldn’t even be considered a person. She would remain stagnated at the threshold of immortality. Even if she managed to attain the ascension realm in this lifetime, what would that amount to? How much power could she really wield? Moreover, with so many saints in the Confucian Academy, would they really grant Li Liu opportunities to showcase her talents? Even if she did manage to succeed once, she would only end up dead again. Such a cycle of life and death held little significance; each death would merely accrue some merit, or perhaps she would break the rules and get scolded at the Confucian Temple.

During her years in the Liji Cave, Li Liu did not expose herself much, leaving the neighbors in the western part of the town with the impression that she was just a bit prettier than average, inheriting her mother’s beauty, but her personality mirrored her father’s. She was diligent and spoken little, as if there were nothing worthy to mention about her, having neither particularly close friends of the same age nor any faults for the elders to criticize.

Li Liu did frequently go to the school to fetch Li Huai after classes, yet she had never exchanged words with Mr. Qi. 

When Mr. Qi taught, if he happened to glance outside and see the girl, he would merely smile and nod gently, treating her with courtesy, as if acknowledging her presence.

Li Liu had seen enough of the world’s oddities and, given her background, had long since grown accustomed to ignoring the mundane. Initially, she hadn’t given it much thought, simply viewing this scholarly figure as a common Confucian sage who presided over a small realm.

She had once asked the Yang family if Mr. Qi was aware of his own origins, but old Yang had not provided an answer.

The only time Mr. Qi spoke to her was during one of his visits, sharing a drink with her father, Li Er. 

As she brought a few plates of rough snacks to the table, Mr. Qi smiled and said to her, “Li Liu, we are born into this world, and in reality, there isn’t much difference. It’s just a long journey of study, as if we would never return home again. Ultimately, what determines who we are isn’t the gradually decaying body but rather how we think. It doesn’t even hinge on what we want or how far we wish to go; it’s all about the ‘how.’ Life is fleeting, and there will come a time when we can no longer forge ahead. When that day comes, looking back at the path we took, it will be a reflection of how we walked it.”

Then Mr. Qi gently lifted a large bowl filled with homemade, low-quality wine, saying, “Let’s toast to you, for it is thanks to you that we exist, and in this vast world, I, Qi Jingchun, can enjoy this drink.”

Mr. Qi downed the drink in one go.

Li Liu said nothing, only following suit and drank a bowl as well.

Inside the house, the usual snoring of the woman was thunderous, while the child named Li Huai mumbled softly in dream, perhaps worrying about how he had played all day and neglected his studies, wondering what excuse he would come up with to fool the strict Mr. Qi the next morning.

As she walked back to the shop with her mother, Li Liu carried a bamboo basket, while a town man whistled along the way.

Her mother grumbled about Li Huai’s lack of conscience, how long it had been since he had sent a letter home, wondering if he had forgotten his mother while out playing. Yet she was also worried that Li Huai was alone outside, not eating well or dressing warmly, and could be bullied. People outside were not the sort to simply quarrel and move on; if Li Huai ran into trouble and had no one to back him up, what would he do?

Li Liu comforted her mother with words, but her mother turned back to say that she was the most heartless one. Li Huai was far from home and could not honor his parents, while she, as the older sister, was happily enjoying herself on the mountain, leaving her parents to toil at the foot of the mountain for a meager living.

Li Liu felt a bit helpless, as if this sort of problem was something that Chen Pingan managed much better, able to soothe others with just a few words.

At the reflection pool of Lion Peak Cave.

Today, Li Er did not rush Chen Pingan to punch, but instead, surprisingly, began discussing the principles of martial arts.

Li Er got straight to the point, saying, “As martial artists, the essence of our fighting techniques ultimately lies in nurturing the strength to defeat our enemies. Even the most mischievous children in the marketplace likely hope to punch through walls and kill with a single blow; it’s in their nature. Thus, I, Li Er, have never believed in the inherent goodness of humanity. It’s just that Confucian teachings have instilled such beliefs, making people think being a good person, however unclear that may be, is a virtue. As for whether they actually act on it or not, that’s another matter. That’s why wicked people commit crimes, and many martial artists bully the weak, often knowing deep down that they are doing wrong. This is the merit of scholars.”

Li Er flashed a grin at Chen Pingan, “Don’t be fooled by my lack of education; even a simple farmer like me has a few insights. However, practitioners of martial arts tend to be taciturn, as if they are cats caught in the wild, not adept at hunting mice. My junior brother, Zheng Dafu, is quite the opposite—always prattling on like a woman. It’s unavoidable. Once someone becomes clever, they can’t help but think and talk too much. Although Zheng Dafu may not have made a name for himself, he actually possesses quite a bit of knowledge, but it’s far too scattered and not pure enough, muddling his martial prowess.”

“Since I rarely teach martial arts, I’ll take this opportunity to share more with you today—just this once.”

Li Er looked at Chen Pingan, who stood a short distance away, and continued, “You and I stand in different places. Even if you face a tenth-tier martial artist at your sixth tier, you must secure a position where you cannot be defeated. The disparity in realms doesn’t mean you can’t lose to me; facing a powerful enemy, if your spirit is unsettled before you even move, it’s akin to seeking death.”

Li Er appeared to have not moved a muscle at all.

In an instant, Chen Pingan found himself sliding several feet away.

The surrounding waters of the immense mirror momentarily stilled, even showing signs of flowing backward.

This was the result of Li Er’s martial intent.

“Having that desire to win and survive doesn’t mean one should act recklessly without understanding the consequences. Even a retreat in martial intent is not a concession.”

Li Er nodded and continued, “A common scholar who often encounters blades and swords naturally becomes unafraid of clubs and sticks. Therefore, pure martial artists who seek the path must often find peers to spar with and hone their skills, or venture to the battlefield, facing ten with one, breaking through hundreds. Beyond defeating opponents, they must master various weapons, training their senses to observe all directions and hear all sounds, so as to cultivate a brave heart. No matter who you are, you must dare to strike.”

Li Er laughed, saying, “Without practicing true martial arts, one first suffers through hardships and injuries. It’s not just about strengthening the body and bones; it’s also about eliminating any fear when facing disparities in strength. However, once you have mastered the killing techniques of martial arts, indulging in them could eventually backfire.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “A punch should not be thrown lightly.”

He quickly added, “It should not be thrown carelessly.”

Li Er then withdrew his hands; otherwise, Chen Pingan would merely repeat, “A punch should not be thrown lightly,” but to withstand a solid hit, he would need at least the strength of a tenth-tier martial artist.

Training martial arts is hard work; it wouldn’t make sense to avoid throwing a punch if the opportunity arose.

Li Er stood in place, breathing normally, extending his left arm and gently tapping his left wrist, forearm, joints, and muscles, slowly saying, “The human muscles and bones resemble the roots of a dragon vein; every muscle is like a mountain peak. Strengthening one’s muscles and refining the body is all about polishing every subtlety, honing countless specifics to perfection, then accumulating them without conflict. When one punches down, even if a city gate does not open, it must still break through; even if mountains do not crumble, they must still shatter!”

Li Er withdrew his right hand and suddenly swung his left arm.

A gale surged forth, causing Chen Pingan’s blue robe to flutter wildly.

The water around the mirror began to flow backward once more.

Li Er’s words resonated deeply with Chen Pingan. This was akin to a Qi practitioner striving to open as many residences as possible to accumulate spiritual energy. 

It was all about facing perceived equals in a contest, yet still managing to overcome the odds through greater strength.

Li Er gradually formed a fighting stance.

Ultimately, the stance became fixed, and Li Er said, “Feet, hands, eyes, stance, strength, energy, intent, unity of the internal and external—this is what practitioners of Qi refer to as creating a small world. For us martial artists, a single pure martial intent is like an iron cavalry, expanding our territory, while Qi practitioners seek to protect what they have achieved, establishing prosperous cities and towns, arranging their troops. Of course, this is what Zheng Dafu says; I could never think of such flowery words.”

Li Er lightly stomped his foot, “If the legs lack strength, they’re like a ghost hitting a wall. At the beginning of martial training, if one takes a misstep, it’s like drawing a ghostly symbol. Don’t even think about reaching a realm where ‘one’s spirit fills the body and one becomes a perfect person.’”

Li Er casually extended his fingers, bending them slightly, pointing at his own eyes, and said, “When entering the world of martial arts, one must train their eyes to be keen, anticipating the enemy’s movements, watching their punches.”

In an instant, Chen Pingan felt as though he were being struck in the chest by two fists, sending him flying. He spun mid-air, his hands grasping the ground with fingers like claws. As he landed, sparks flew from the mirror surface, and he managed to stop himself from falling into the water.

Li Er stood where Chen Pingan had previously stood, saying, “That punch wasn’t heavy or fast, yet you still couldn’t block it. Why? Because both your eyes and heart aren’t trained enough. When facing a formidable opponent, life and death hang in the balance; many instincts can either save your life or lead to your demise. With that previous movement, you should have instinctively focused on my fingers and eyes; that’s human instinct. Even if you were careful enough, it would still be too late. This is how martial artists discern life and death; in a fight, it’s not like traveling through landscapes where you have time to think. Furthermore, your heart reaching before your hand is one of the greatest maladies of martial arts.”

At this point, Li Er inquired, “Do you, Chen Pingan, think you’re observant enough? Always cautious and aware?”

Chen Pingan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his palm and nodded.

Li Er stated, “This is where your punch intent is flawed. You always think your skill is sufficient, but on the contrary, it’s far from enough. You should understand that in the world of eighth and ninth-tier martial artists, life and death are often determined by their own strongest techniques. Why? Because they are more cautious of their weaknesses, and when they punch from their strengths, they often become self-satisfied and unaware.”

Li Er then displayed a fighting stance, taking up a familiar posture to Chen Pingan, the Grand Dragon stance, and the most adept at the Divine Beating Drum technique.

Li Er said, “The sayings in martial arts about having three heads and six arms refer to divine abilities; they aren't just idle talk. There are countless styles of martial arts in the world, each with different stances, foundations, and techniques. The stance is foundational, the foundation is the base, and the techniques are the façade. When combined, they create a variety of martial arts styles, resulting in the countless martial manuals in existence. You’ve traveled quite a bit in the martial world, so you should know that in the marketplace, people often refer to ordinary martial practitioners as ‘martial hands,’ and this is why.”

Li Er relaxed his stance, smoothly executing the Divine Beating Drum technique, which appeared soft and slow but contained immense spirit, striking Chen Pingan’s eyes as something entirely different from his own.

Li Er executed the Divine Beating Drum technique again, this time with a different martial intent—rapid like thunder, halting suddenly. He smiled and said, “When martial artists face opponents, as long as the realms are not too disparate, the different principles and techniques create countless possibilities for victory or defeat. However, once one becomes a mere ‘martial hand,’ it’s just flashy moves that look good but lack real substance. Does youth fear the old? Can chaotic punches kill a master? The master may not react, but with just one strike, the showy martial hand could easily perish.”

Chen Pingan suddenly tilted his head.

Li Er was already standing in front of him, a tenth-tier punch looming beside Chen Pingan’s face.

Li Er chuckled, “Once taught, understanding is achieved; once understood, it can be practiced. Quite good.”

This punch, though not fast, was still powerful. Had Chen Pingan not dodged, today’s sparring session would have ended there, and Li Er would have had to retreat.

Li Er withdrew his punch. Although Chen Pingan managed to avoid what should have been a solid hit to his forehead, he still felt the fierce wind cut across his face, leaving a trail of blood.

Li Er said, “You’re good at sneaking punches. After all this time of feeding you punches, you should take this chance to learn my stance and try it out.”

Chen Pingan nodded, mimicking Li Er’s punching stance.

Li Er stood to the side, moving with Chen Pingan’s punch while pointing out several flaws in his stance. In the midst of their practice, he lightly kicked Chen Pingan’s lower leg and lightly tapped his wrist, elbow, and shoulder with two fingers, finally saying, “Don’t let your stances become rigid; the differences in physiques are vast. Just your height alone is different from mine. Even though you’ve deliberately adjusted the punches for yourself, there’s still much lacking in meaning. The essence of martial intent is precious; the principle of the stance is paramount. It hinges on one word: ‘living.’ The punch is alive; it is our second life as pure martial artists, much more significant than a Qi practitioner’s astral body or his wandering spirit.”

Chen Pingan closed his eyes and, after a moment, threw another punch.

“You’re aiming in the right direction.”

Li Er nodded, “Training punches isn’t like cultivating. No matter how many layers of realms you break through, if you don’t begin with the subtleties, then your muscles will decline, blood will stagnate, and your spirit will falter. These are inevitable. Those practicing martial arts at the foot of the mountain can hurt themselves, especially those practicing external styles, merely exchanging their lives for strength. If the punch isn’t profound, it’s a path to self-destruction. Pure martial artists can only rely on martial intent to sustain their lives, but this matter is difficult to articulate.”

With that, Li Er sat cross-legged and beckoned for Chen Pingan to sit down as well.

Li Er remained silent for a long time, seemingly lost in thought, recalling some past events. “Outside of realism lies deeper meaning,” as Zheng Dafu often recited after learning martial arts, repeating it many times. I didn’t think much of it then, but I remembered. You might want to listen to see if it benefits you. Zheng Dafu’s approach to martial arts differs from mine; both styles of martial intent have their merits. If you get the chance, return to the Fallen Mountain (Luopo Shan) and discuss this with him. Zheng Dafu’s martial intent is just below mine, which makes it seem he’s inferior to his senior brother. In those early years, Zheng Dafu often complained about favoritism from our master, believing that the master deliberately chose our paths to delay him, step by step. In truth, he eventually understood this himself, though he would never admit it. Thus, I find his incessant chatter bothersome; he’s just a gatekeeper, yet he endlessly prattles on without proper decorum. So, whenever we sparred, I often ended up giving him a good beating.”

Li Er’s hands formed fists, and as he leaned slightly forward, this habitual motion radiated an imposing aura like mountains rising from the ground.

This was all martial intent.

Li Er slowly said, “When one reaches a small level of martial accomplishment, during deep sleep, one’s martial intent flows naturally, awakening them in the face of an enemy, as if blessed by the gods. If such is true even in sleep, let alone when awake, thus martial practitioners should seek protective treasures like this, similar to sword cultivators who need not rely on external weapons for combat.”

Li Er chuckled lightly, softly tapping the mirror’s surface with a fist. Then he opened his fist into a palm and feigned a punch, saying, “With the sky above and the earth below, when drawing back your fist, imagine cradling an infant. This exemplifies the balance of hardness and softness; pursuing any extreme is never true martial principle. Over time, the longer one practices, the more one can connect movements fluidly, executing them effortlessly. Why do I think the Divine Beating Drum technique by Cui Cheng is a good one? It could even be regarded as one of the best martial arts in the world. It appears fierce but embodies the true essence of ‘a person practicing martial arts,’ rather than the martial art just following the individual.”

Chen Pingan was puzzled yet curious, but he felt that asking about the old man from Cui’s perspective would be inappropriate.

As they discussed the Divine Beating Drum technique, it naturally led to a conversation about the elder. Li Er gazed into the distance and said, “Old man Cui Cheng is indeed a remarkable figure. He passed on his martial arts to you, which can be considered a true transmission, not merely feeding you punches and teaching you stances. What Cui Cheng appears to impart is pure strength and ferocity, yet he and you, Chen Pingan, share a complementary relationship. This is the demeanor of a top-tier master. I, Li Er, cannot compare.”

At this point, Li Er shook his head and repeated, “I certainly cannot.”

Chen Pingan sighed.

Thinking back to the painstaking training, back when he was on the second floor of the bamboo building, even someone like him who was unafraid of pain had to obediently lie on the wooden bed below, rolling up the covers and quietly crying once.

Li Er continued, “Thus, when you learn martial arts, you can only let Cui Cheng teach you the fundamental principles, while I, Li Er, will supplement your martial intent, and that is the right path. If I teach you first and Cui Cheng comes next, it would be like planting ten pounds of strength into the fields but only reaping seven or eight pounds of crops. Such a result holds little meaning, with limited benefits.”

This left Chen Pingan with a new question.

Why hadn’t Li Er sparred with Cui Cheng?

After leaving Liji Cave, Li Er had returned to Longquan County for a while.

Yet these two tenth-tier martial artists, standing at the pinnacle of martial arts, had never engaged in a match.

Regrettably, Li Er did not discuss this.

Li Er slapped his knee, rising with a smile, “Well, I’ve said enough. Today, I’ve spoken more than I have during my years in North Julu Prefecture combined. Next, I’ll challenge you to the Mountain Shaking Fist using my ninth-tier martial artist strength. Don’t worry; it won’t mix with any tenth-tier punches. However, I advise you not to get too pleased with yourself; this ninth-tier strength is quite substantial. Your Aunt Liu wants you to stay a bit longer at the shop; it would not be fair to delay your journey, would it? But since you sought out this sparring session, after I’ve fed you punches for two or three months, you’ll have to recover slowly. If you find it hard to walk, you can’t blame anyone else.”

Chen Pingan stared in disbelief.

Is this really happening?

As a punch came flying toward him.

Even though Chen Pingan was aware of the impending danger and attempted to block with his arms, the punch sent him tumbling, directly crashing into the mirror’s surface and plunging into the water.

That day, instead of teaching Pei Qian martial arts, Cui Cheng donned a Confucian robe, no longer barefoot, and wore the boots that Chen Ruchu had prepared for the old man ahead of time. He stepped out of the second floor and stood on the first floor, hands clasped behind him, gazing at the words scrawled on the wall of the bamboo building. These words were composed by Li Xisheng years ago, beautifully written. As the patriarch of the Cui family in Baoping Prefecture, Cui Cheng was well aware of the merits of literature, and his grandson Cui Zhan had built upon the foundation laid by the elder, undoubtedly understanding the distinctions of literary excellence.

The words on the bamboo building held heavy meaning; otherwise, they could not have left such an impression on the entire Fallen Mountain.

Nor could he have maintained a clear mind on Fallen Mountain, no longer the pitiful madman he had been for nearly a century.

Pei Qian had gone off to play, followed closely by the little shadow, Zhou Mili, who said she wanted to check on the business at Qilong Alley to see if it had lost money in her absence. She also wanted to carefully review the accounts to prevent Shi Rou, the named store manager, from embezzling funds.

The old man did not stop her. What could a child that tiny do? Should she not learn from the old folks, living in a state of gloom every day?

Cui Cheng pushed open the bamboo door leading to the first floor, which served as both a study and a place with a wooden bed.

It was cleaned spotless by Chen Ruchu, devoid of even a speck of dust.

After leaving the house, Cui Cheng took a stroll to the Linlu Academy at Piyun Mountain. Upon his return, he sat at the stone table by the cliff. Since Chen Ruchu hadn’t followed Pei Qian down the mountain due to the many affairs on the mountain, she was always busy. When she saw the old man leave the bamboo building, Chen Ruchu hurried to bring a large red lacquered food box, setting out the wine jug, bowls, and dishes neatly. Cui Cheng smiled and asked why there were no sunflower seeds. The little girl in a pink skirt blushed and fished out several handfuls of seeds from her pocket and placed them on the table.

Chen Lingjun still preferred wandering alone. Today, upon seeing the old man sitting alone at the stone bench, he rubbed his eyes vigorously, realizing he hadn’t misseen.

Chen Lingjun didn’t dare to get too familiar with this old man, as he was the type who could kill him with a single punch in Longquan County.

To his surprise, Cui Cheng waved him over, saying, “Come sit.”

Chen Lingjun made a pained face, saying, “Old senior, if I don’t go, are you going to hit me?”

Cui Cheng nodded.

Chen Lingjun immediately dashed over, thinking that a strong man must bend and stretch; otherwise, how could he have survived in Longquan County, relying solely on his cultivation?

Cui Cheng chuckled, “Every now and then, losing money on purpose is quite amusing.”

Chen Lingjun blinked, bewildered, “Huh?”

Seeing him pretending to be clueless, Cui Cheng didn’t elaborate further, casually asking, “Has Chen Pingan ever advised you to distance yourself from your brother, the River God?”

Chen Lingjun shook his head, gently lifting his sleeve to wipe the table, which was cleaner than the mirror. “He’s an even bigger fool than I am, spouting nonsense and throwing money around. He wouldn’t say that to me. He even helps me save face.”

Cui Cheng commented, “Chen Pingan’s journey to North Julu Prefecture is partly for you. Traveling thousands of miles along the river isn’t an easy task.”

Chen Lingjun fell silent.

Cui Cheng picked up a spare wine cup, poured some wine, and handed it to the young boy in green across the table.

Chen Lingjun, feeling nervous, said, “Old senior, this isn’t a punishment drink, right? I’ve been working diligently on Fallen Mountain, and I haven’t done anything bad at all.”

Cui Cheng laughed, “Just drink.”

Chen Lingjun took the wine cup, looking woeful, and took a small sip.

Cui Cheng asked, “With how Chen Pingan treats you, can you treat others half as well in the future?”

Chen Lingjun replied softly, “I suppose so?”

Cui Cheng smiled, “That’s enough.”

This time, it was Chen Lingjun who found himself confused. “That’s enough?”

Cui Cheng chuckled and remained silent.

Chen Lingjun muttered, “You’re not Chen Pingan, so how can you say that?”

Cui Cheng teased, “Shall we make a bet?”

Chen Lingjun wailed, “I really don’t have much spare change left! All I have is my wife’s dowry, and I can’t touch a single copper coin. I really can’t afford to gamble!”

Cui Cheng said, “Have you ever considered why you act so terrified of me when, in reality, you’re not that scared? If you ever face someone or something you can’t handle, would you dare to ask me for help?”

Chen Lingjun lowered his head, one fist rotating around the rim of his cup, murmuring, “Because of my good-hearted master.”

Cui Cheng then asked, “Have you thought about why Chen Pingan is willing to keep you on Fallen Mountain, treating you no differently than he would treat others?”

Chen Lingjun muttered, “He’s just a soft-hearted fool.”

Cui Cheng smiled, “Because in Chen Pingan’s eyes, you’re not lacking.”

Chen Lingjun softly retorted, “That’s nonsense.”

Cui Cheng inquired, “What did you say?”

Chen Lingjun quickly raised his head, holding the cup with both hands, and beamed, “Old man, how about we make a deal?”

Yet Chen Lingjun found himself frozen in place.

Make a deal? Wasn’t that courting death?

Ah, his little sense of martial arts had only served to make him the butt of the joke.

Chen Lingjun never expected that instead of getting angry, Cui Cheng would raise his cup with a smile, saying, “Then let’s make a deal.”

After drinking, Chen Lingjun still felt restless.

Cui Cheng did not linger on this little rascal, saying, “Chen Pingan isn’t very good at expressing himself with those close to him, so you might want to think about whether you’ve underestimated yourself. You possess certain qualities that even Chen Pingan feels he can’t match.”

Chen Lingjun nodded vigorously, standing up, bowing respectfully to bid farewell, and slowly left. But after running far away, he couldn’t help but pause and look back.

It seemed that today, old Cui had been a bit odd.

Cui Cheng drank alone.

In his youth, he felt his heart sharpening, unmatched in brilliance, eternal and unbroken.

After another round of training punches.

Chen Pingan found it rare to be bloodied all over yet still able to sit and wash his face with water.

Li Er sat nearby.

Chen Pingan took out two jars of glutinous rice wine and shared one with Li Er, casually chatting.

Because Li Er said there was no need to drink that celestial wine.

What was called casual chatting was essentially Chen Pingan rambling on about the past.

Before he knew it, they had moved from North Julu Prefecture to Tongye Prefecture, and then to Baoping Prefecture and back to his hometown.

Chen Pingan smiled, “I remember the first time I went to deliver letters and earn some copper coins in Fulujie and Taoye Alley. After getting used to the muddy roads of Mud Bottle Alley and Longyao, stepping onto those blue stone slabs for the first time made me fearful of dirtying my straw sandals, almost forgetting how to lift my feet. Later, when I sent Baoping and Li Huai to Daxu, visiting an old minister’s home in Huangtingguo for a meal felt similar; the first time I stayed at a celestial inn, I pretended to be calm and collected, managing my gaze to avoid wandering too much, which was somewhat taxing.”

“There was a banquet at Shujian Lake hosted by Gu Can, with exiled princes of noble birth, sons of generals, and disciples of celestial masters present. If I weren’t so disappointed in Gu Can, I’d have been somewhat pleased to see that natural and composed little snot-nosed kid. This is what Fire Dragon Real Person referred to as my selfishness; at that time, I felt that without me, the little snot-nosed kid at the end of Mud Bottle Alley could still live well. At Shujian Lake, only that occasion was when I most wanted to leave everything behind and not care about anything, rather than what happened later.”

“Many things are just hard to adapt to. It’s not about liking or disliking; it’s just about adapting.”

“What the martial world is, and what immortals are, are two different things.”

“I opened my eyes wide, straining to observe all unfamiliar people and matters. There were many things I didn’t understand at first, some I later understood but still couldn’t accept.”

Li Er asked, “Was it difficult to bear?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “It’s just that it feels a bit uncomfortable inside. However, there are times when I think that on this journey, it hasn’t only been about hardships. Moreover, having seen so many people suffer more than I have, who still didn’t live better, facing challenges without end, who could I turn to for an explanation? Isn’t it just about enduring? Surviving one day at a time. When they can’t endure anymore, it’s like many people in my hometown who got hit by a major illness; they just grab some medicine and boil a few bowls, and they’re gone. Family members understand, but those suffering on the bed are more aware in their hearts. It’s not that they aren’t sad; it’s just that there’s really nothing to say.”

“If one day I must leave this world, I want people to remember me. They might be sad, but it can’t just be sadness. When they eventually aren’t so sad anymore and carry on with their lives, they can occasionally think of someone named Chen Pingan, who existed between heaven and earth. Some matters, whether big or small, can only be accomplished by Chen Pingan.”

In the end, as Chen Pingan drank his wine, he gazed into the distance, smiling, “Just thinking about being able to eat a plate of stir-fried winter bamboo shoots with meat every winter brings me great joy. It feels like putting down my chopsticks means winter has passed, and spring has arrived.”

Li Er turned his head, looking at the young man.

It felt strangely familiar.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 661: There is True Meaning in This

As dusk fell, Li Liu brought a food box up the mountain. By the thatched cottage, Li Er and Chen Ping'an sat at the table, having their meal.

During today's training, it was rare for Li Er to not throw any punches. Instead, he spread out a detailed diagram of the "Fire Dragon" that illustrated the meridians and acupoints on the ground. He meticulously explained to Chen Ping'an several ancient martial arts styles, discussing the different pathways of pure true energy (Qi) circulation, each style's nuances and intricacies. He particularly elaborated on the classification of the human body's five hundred and twenty muscles, breaking down the principles and intentions behind various martial arts, including the unique techniques used by different sects to temper muscles and bones, refine true energy, and the hidden secrets that might lead some masters to become obsessed with their practice.

This was the first time Chen Ping'an had heard that ancient martial artists would categorize muscles into voluntary and involuntary types. He learned that many obscure techniques for muscle refinement, which seemed to originate from "barbaric lands," were typically overlooked by ordinary martial artists. As a result, even if they practiced the martial forms passed down through their sects, complete refinement was often unattainable, leading to significant differences in the foundational levels of martial artists at the same realm.

Cui Cheng's teaching style was grand and forceful, akin to a waterfall crashing down. A slight misstep in response could leave Chen Ping'an feeling worse than death. More importantly, it forged an instinct within him, compelling him to grit his teeth and endure, forcing his body to undergo a rigorous "mountain opening" exercise. Furthermore, Cui Cheng had helped Chen Ping'an refine his punches twice; during the first session in the bamboo tower, he not only attacked Chen Ping'an's body but also his very soul.

It was as if Cui Cheng had presented him with ten pounds of punch intent, and Chen Ping'an had to obediently absorb it all; losing even an ounce was unacceptable. Cui Cheng marched forward along the path of martial arts, completely unconcerned about whether the "child" in his charge would end up with blisters on his feet or suffer injuries.

In contrast, Li Er's approach to teaching martial arts also involved tempering the body, but he placed equal emphasis on imparting fundamental principles, encouraging Chen Ping'an to ponder them himself. Li Er was guiding him along the path.

There was no distinction of superiority between the two methods; it was merely a difference in the sequence of instruction. As Li Er said, had he swapped places with Cui Cheng to teach, Chen Ping'an would not have attained today's martial arts insights.

At the dining table, Chen Ping'an continued to ask Li Er about a specific pathway of true energy circulation depicted in the Fire Dragon diagram.

Li Liu sat quietly beside them, not interrupting.

Before long, the wooden table, benches, and bamboo chairs inside the cottage were all complete.

Chen Ping'an curiously asked, "Uncle Li, did you always practice martial arts with such detail from the start?"

Li Er chuckled, "I couldn't afford to be careless. My master keeps a close eye on the progress. He doesn't concern himself with the trivial details along the martial path. When the time comes, if he feels I should have a certain level of punch intent, he expects me to have it. If he senses any laziness, the consequences will be dire. I’m fine; I just follow the rules and practice diligently. Zheng Dafeng had it much worse back in the day. I remember he left Li Zhu Cave Heaven with a soul still trapped by my master. I don't know if my master ever released it; even though we are brothers of the same sect, some matters are too sensitive to inquire about."

Chen Ping'an was increasingly puzzled.

How could one practice martial arts with an incomplete soul?

Li Er took a sip of wine and said, "It’s fine for me to tell you this. Zheng Dafeng's martial arts method revolves around his different souls. Each strand of his soul practices separately. With three souls and seven spirits, he needed to practice martial arts within his ten thoughts. So when my junior brother was guarding the door, he often appeared drowsy, but that wasn’t real sleep—he was laboriously practicing martial arts. As for my junior sister Su Dian, her method is different; she emphasizes day and night practice and dream practice. My junior brother Shi Ling Mountain often travels through the river of time to refine his spirit and body, frequently drowning in the process. Fortunately, my master was able to fish out his 'body.' All methods are good, but in the end, whether one can reach the highest level depends on their own fortune. According to my master, on each person's unique path, there are many who take a wrong turn and end up as useless."

Li Liu smiled and said, "Chen Ping'an, my mother asked me to ask you if you think the shop is too shabby, which is why you never want to stay there overnight when you come down the mountain?"

Chen Ping'an replied helplessly, "If I stay there overnight, rumors could spread, which would tarnish your reputation in the town. Even if Miss Li herself doesn’t care, Aunt Liu has to deal with neighbors and friends regularly. If there’s ever a quarrel, outsiders might bring it up, causing Aunt Liu to feel upset for days. Even if you get married later, it would still be a point of contention. The better Miss Li marries, the more women enjoy digging up old histories."

Li Liu chuckled, "That’s true, but you should discuss this with my mother."

As for marriage, Li Liu had never given it much thought.

Chen Ping'an glanced at Li Er; there was still one last training session to go.

Li Er told him to rest well and that there was no rush, but Chen Ping'an felt a sense of foreboding.

Li Er asked, "Some predecessors in the history of the vast world have martial foundations similar to your 'Xiao Da Long' style. Where did you learn it?"

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine and smiled, "Uncle Li, can’t it just be my own realization of the martial style?"

Li Er chuckled. The look in his eyes was akin to that of a seasoned veteran sizing up a son-in-law, leaving Chen Ping'an with nowhere to hide.

Chen Ping'an didn’t continue to conceal it, saying, "This martial style was created by an old gentleman from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land in Tongyezhou, known as 'Zhong Qiu.' He is the national teacher of the Southern Garden Kingdom. In the martial world, he is revered as a scholar and martial master. I once wanted to invite him to leave the Lotus Flower Blessed Land with me, but unfortunately, he had many concerns at the time and didn't wish to leave. I wonder if he will change his mind in the future."

Li Er remarked, "He should come to the vast world."

Li Liu thought for a moment and recalled the atmosphere near the capital of the Southern Garden Kingdom, saying, "The current Lotus Flower Blessed Land cannot hold him. A curled dragon in a pond is not a long-term plan."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "When I return to Luo Po Mountain, I will talk to Master Zhong again."

After Li Er finished his meal and drink, he went down the mountain.

Li Liu stayed on Lion Peak to "cultivate her celestial arts with the old immortal on the mountain."

Carrying the food box, Li Liu headed to her residence, inviting Chen Ping'an to take a stroll together.

This time, Lion Peak was inexplicably closed off. Not only could no one enter or exit at the mountain gate, but the practitioners on the mountain were also effectively under house arrest, not allowed to move about freely.

As a result, the two encountered no practitioners from Lion Peak on their way.

Li Liu asked, "After leaving Dragon Palace Cave Heaven and Fushui Island, the spiritual energy on Lion Peak feels much thinner. Will you find it uncomfortable?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Not at all. The spiritual energy I've accumulated on Fushui Island, from the Water Mansion, Mountain Shrine, and Wooden House, hasn’t been fully refined yet. This is the first time I’ve felt overstuffed since becoming a cultivator. On Fushui Island, relying on the lingering spiritual energy, I drew nearly two hundred talismans, mostly waterway talismans. I used up all the celestial elixirs I bought from Chunlu Garden in one go."

Li Liu said, "These are trivial matters, you don’t need to feel too grateful to Fushui Island and Li Yuan. If Li Yuan were smart enough, he should have given you that 'Junqing Yuxiang' jade tablet, but unfortunately, he’s too petty. He’s like someone who, when it rains, only cups their hands to catch water without thinking of bringing a barrel to store it. After the heavy rain, it only quenches thirst temporarily."

Chen Ping'an took out the "Rest" wooden tablet, saying, "Li Yuan gave me this when he left the Water Dragon Sect along the Ji Du. It may be a small gift, but the sentiment is strong, not inferior to that 'Yuxiang' tablet."

Li Liu glanced at the crude wooden tablet and shook her head. "This orange wood tablet won’t help you much in your cultivation, especially regarding the efficient absorption of water element spiritual energy."

Chen Ping'an put away the wooden tablet, smiling, "But next time I come to North Julu Continent and Jidu, I can openly find Li Yuan to drink without any pretense. Just for drinking. If it were that 'Yuxiang' tablet, I wouldn’t accept it. Even if I forced myself to take it, it would feel like a burden."

Li Liu was silent for a moment before slowly saying, "Mr. Chen, you’re nearly at the breaking point."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "It seems like I'm just one punch away."

Li Liu suddenly said, "Still the same principle: on the path of cultivation, never hesitate. For martial arts, every step must be solid and progressive. Cultivators need a different mindset; they must dare to seek and accept great opportunities without fear or hesitation, without overly calculating the teachings about the interdependence of blessings and misfortunes. Mr. Chen might think that once all five elemental attributes are complete and he gathers five of the destined items to fully rebuild the Longevity Bridge, it won’t matter if he stays stuck at the third realm. In truth, such a mindset is a lower-level one."

Chen Ping'an contemplated slowly.

Li Liu continued, "Since you've become a cultivator, you should have a transcendent mindset, one that is miles away from the ground. Cultivating martial arts involves ascending with the flow, while cultivation involves going against the current. So when you reach the realm of a martial artist, Mr. Chen should think about how to break through the bottleneck of the Qi Refining realm. The three realms of the Liu Muscle realm have always been a place for people to stay; do you really expect to ascend to the heavens in one leap?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head with a smile, "I don’t dare to think that, nor would I."

Li Liu said, "Before I returned to Lion Peak, a martial artist from the Golden Armor Continent broke through to the Golden Body realm, becoming the strongest in the world. Consequently, all local martial temples across the continent must respond and congratulate him. The other eight continents must share a portion of their martial luck with the Golden Armor Continent, splitting it in two: one for the martial artist, the other remaining in the continent he belongs to. According to old traditions, martial artists’ luck is similar to cultivators' spiritual energy and is not as abstract as fate. The Central Land Divine Continent is vast and rich, with one continent capable of rivaling eight. Therefore, martial artists from the Central Land often obtain the most martial luck from other continents. However, once a martial artist breaks through in a different continent, the Central Land will send out even more martial luck. Otherwise, the strongest martial artists in the world would just be hoarded by the Central Land."

This was fresh news to Chen Ping'an.

Li Liu joked, "If that martial artist from the Golden Armor Continent delays his breakthrough, a good thing could turn into a bad thing, missing out on the martial luck. It seems this person not only has abundant martial luck but also good fortune."

Chen Ping'an caught Li Liu’s drift; after Li Er trained him on Lion Peak, he had begun to chase and surpass that talented martial artist's foundation at the sixth realm.

Of course, he felt joy, but he couldn’t say he was exuberant.

Curious, Chen Ping'an asked, "Can the practitioners at the mountain peak see the trajectories of martial luck flowing across the Nine Continents?"

"The ebb and flow of martial luck have always been a matter that the Confucian scholars couldn't grasp or manage. In the past, the Confucian sages considered intervening, intending to incorporate it into their own regulations, but the Sage of Rites didn’t approve, and it fell through. It's quite interesting; the Sage of Rites, who personally drafted the rules, seems to consistently oppose later generations of Confucianism. Many choices beneficial to the development of the Confucian lineage have been personally denied by the Sage of Rites."

Li Liu spoke eloquently, revealing many hidden truths: "Unless a peak Ascendant-level practitioner can vaguely perceive the signs, it’s difficult for others to notice. Only the seventy-two sages of the Confucians, who oversee the heavenly curtain, can see it most clearly. The so-called strongest among pure martial artists is just a present matter, and when compared to martial artists of the same realm from the Nine Continents, it becomes evident. Therefore, if practitioners like Cao Ci and yourself remain stagnant at a certain realm for too long, all other martial artists of the same realm will not expect to share in that martial luck."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "I’m still far from Cao Ci."

Li Liu chuckled, "That’s true. In that case, it’s best to look further ahead. When you reach the ninth and tenth realms, the difference between the ninth and tenth realms is a chasm. Furthermore, even at the tenth realm, it isn't a true endpoint; within it are three levels, and the differences are significant. Song Changjing from the Great Li Dynasty, up to the ninth realm, was not as good as my father, but that may not be the case now. Song Changjing has a naturally strong aura. If both reached the tenth realm with equal strength, my father's temperament would be a disadvantage. In a fight against him, my father would suffer. That’s why my father left his hometown to come to North Julu Continent. Now that Song Changjing is stalled at his peak, my father has returned to the essence of martial arts. If they were to fight, Song Changjing would still lose. But if both reach the closest point to the legendary eleventh realm, the possibility of my father losing would be much greater. Of course, if my father can reach the legendary eleventh realm first, Song Changjing would find it hard to survive with just a single punch. If the roles were reversed, my father would meet the same fate."

Chen Ping'an quietly asked, "If Uncle Li had stayed in the Baoping Continent, would they have had no opportunities at all?"

Li Liu nodded, "Though nothing is absolute, it’s likely so."

Li Liu smiled and asked back, "Mr. Chen, are you not curious about whether these truths were told by my father or if I knew them myself?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "There’s no need to know this. I believe both Miss Li and Uncle Li can handle family matters and outside affairs well."

Li Liu suddenly said, "If Mr. Chen feels that being fed punches isn't enough and wants to enjoy a thorough sparring session, I have a suitable candidate who can be summoned at any time. However, once the other party strikes, they tend to take things to the extreme."

Chen Ping'an didn’t hesitate to reply, "That’s more than enough; I’d rather wait until next time I travel to North Julu Continent."

He estimated that he might not even withstand Li Er's next feeding of punches. Moreover, once he stepped into the seventh realm of martial arts, he should immediately return to Baoping Continent, as there were many matters he needed to address back at Luo Po Mountain. After that, he would undoubtedly head south again to Old Dragon City, take a cross-continental ferry, and journey to the Upside-Down Mountain.

Li Liu said, "Actually, that person is someone Mr. Chen knows well; he was at the Mirror Mountain in Ghostly Valley."

Chen Ping'an suddenly understood.

It was that enigmatic person who exuded an aura of great danger, one he had never felt even from the talented Yang Ningxing of the Chongxuan Office.

Li Liu asked, "Mr. Chen, have you ever considered what your opponent feels when they face you, when the realms are not too different?"

Chen Ping'an was taken aback and shook his head, "I’ve never thought about that."

Over the years of traveling, he had encountered numerous battles and many enemies.

The first person that came to Chen Ping'an's mind was Ma Ku Xuan, a cultivation genius who had emerged from Baoping Continent. After becoming the direct heir of the Zhenwu Mountain, he had broken through with great momentum. After their encounter on the streets of Caiyi Kingdom, they had never had a chance to reunite. He had heard that Ma Ku Xuan was doing exceptionally well and had been recognized as the foremost cultivator after Li Tunqing and Wei Jin in Baoping Continent. The recent news from the public reports was that he had avenged his family by slaying a general from the Sea Tide Iron Cavalry.

Li Liu smiled and said, "If I were in your position and my realm was similar to Mr. Chen's, I would never strike first."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "Miss Li, you flatter me."

Li Liu said, "Being overly humble isn’t good either."

Chen Ping'an replied, "It just shows that my skills in feigning weakness aren't sufficient."

Li Liu couldn’t help but laugh, "Mr. Chen, please leave your opponent a way out."

Chen Ping'an also laughed, "This matter truly cannot be agreed upon with Miss Li."

Before they knew it, they had reached the summit of Lion Peak. Although it was not particularly late, it was not yet the hour for deep sleep. They could see the lights in the small town at the foot of the mountain, with some streets illuminated like slender fire dragons, particularly conspicuous—likely the streets where wealthy families gathered. In other parts of the town, the lights were sparse, with only a few scattered here and there.

Li Liu asked, "Having traveled so far, do you know the true origins of the blessed lands and many secret realms?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Once, a friend mentioned that not only the Nine Continents of the Vast World but also the other three realms are remnants of the old world, fragmented territories that arose after its collapse. Some secret realms may even be the remnants of ancient deities' skulls, corpses, or those fallen stars that were once the palaces and abodes of gods."

Li Liu said, "Your friend truly dares to say such things."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "His courage is quite significant; he’s equipped with treasures and dares to travel across continents alone. Yet, he’s also quite timid, afraid of soaring too high."

Li Liu asked, "A good friend?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "I suppose so."

The mountain peak was filled with a gentle breeze that carried the fragrance of the valleys in the season of spring rain.

After a moment of silence, Li Liu casually asked, "Mr. Chen, have you read any books recently?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Yes, one book…"

He paused for a moment, reflecting, "It’s a strange book, a collection of short stories about life and death, given to me by a great demon who enjoys refining mountains."

Li Liu lost interest, having seen too much of life and death; it certainly wouldn’t benefit her current path.

For her, this life was like being a teacher in a school, where she was assigned homework—not moral studies, not sage texts, nor even about cultivating to a state of ascension, but about how to be a person.

This was, in fact, quite a peculiar situation.

Li Liu felt that she could only grow accustomed to interacting with her parents and her younger brother, Li Huai, behind closed doors; once she stepped outside, her perspective on the world was no different from her past lives.

Chen Ping'an gazed at the lights below, softly saying, "I once read in a scholar's notes that ordinary people spend half their lives wasting time on their beds. It seems cultivators aren't much different; their practice is like sleeping through most of their lives. However, after careful consideration, it's ultimately different. Standing in different places to view the same thing can yield completely different perspectives on human nature."

"I once read two scholarly notes, both discussing ghosts and worldly matters. One scholar, having held a high position, wrote after retiring to his hometown, while the other, a down-on-his-luck scholar, never entered the officialdom after failing the imperial examinations. Initially, I didn't feel much after reading both notes, but later, during my travels, I casually flipped through them again and found some lingering flavor."

"Standing high allows for broader views of human nature. Standing close allows for deeper analysis of people's hearts."

At this point, Chen Ping'an sighed, "Perhaps this is the true value of traveling thousands of miles and reading thousands of books."

Suddenly, he burst into laughter, "That friend who doesn’t dare to soar on the wind, with his mixed knowledge, made me feel quite ashamed. Once, I casually asked him a question: if there were a small grass at both ends of my hometown alley, so close yet never seeing withering or blooming, would it be sad if it opened its eyes one day? He pondered this question seriously and gave me countless strange answers. But I couldn’t help but laugh. Miss Li, do you know what I was laughing at?"

Li Liu chuckled knowingly, "In that muddy alley, with chickens and dogs roaming around, especially with the hen often leading a bunch of chicks pecking around every day, where would there be flowers and grass?"

Chen Ping'an laughed heartily, nodding vigorously.

Li Liu suddenly sobered and bowed, "Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Chen."

Chen Ping'an was taken aback, unsure of what Li Liu was doing. Had their casual conversation about life and death led to some profound realization?

At that moment, Chen Ping'an could only think that he truly wasn’t cut out for cultivation, his aptitude being quite ordinary. Thus, after this training session on Lion Peak, he needed to work even harder.

After Li Liu got up and said her goodbyes, she took the food box and used the wind to head down the mountain to the shop.

Chen Ping'an, still in a daze, returned to the immortal cave and began practicing his boxing against the mirror, not seeking to increase his punch intent but rather seeking a state of true tranquility.

As night fell, a woman at the fabric shop behind the counter was calculating accounts, flipping through the ledger, and sighing. It had been more than half a month with little income, hardly a surplus of three or two silver coins.

Compared to the three or two silver coins he could earn in a day helping Chen Ping'an at the shop, it was truly disheartening. Thankfully, living in a small town meant there weren’t many expenses.

The woman stared at the lamp on the counter, lost in thought, before turning to the man standing not far away, fuming, "Li Er, what are you doing standing there? Can you be used as an oil lamp?"

Li Er shook his head.

He understood.

Recently, his alcohol purchases had increased, but it wasn’t fair to blame him entirely; Chen Ping'an drank quite a bit too.

The woman seemed to see through Li Er's thoughts and angrily said, "It's one thing to be tight-fisted, but it’s another to entertain Chen Ping'an. Don’t shift the blame onto him. If you can’t spit out the portion you drank, sell it and pay me back, I won’t complain! You just wander around all day, taking on odd jobs; how much silver do you think you’ll earn in a year? Enough to drink and eat meat?"

Li Er muttered, "Chen Ping'an is leaving soon; can I quit drinking for half a year?"

Upon hearing that Chen Ping'an was leaving, the woman became even angrier, "If our daughter can’t get married, it’s because of you, her father dragging her down! If you could be an official, do you think we’d have matchmakers trampling our doorstep?"

Li Er remained silent.

The woman lamented, "In the future, if Li Huai marries a wife and the girl looks down on our family, I’ll make you sleep outside in the winter!"

Li Er scratched his head.

Just as the woman was about to extinguish the oil lamp, she suddenly heard the sound of the door opening. She immediately dashed out from behind the counter and hid next to Li Er, trembling as she said, "Li Liu went up the mountain; could it be a thief? If someone comes to rob us, Li Er, you better not act recklessly. If a thief takes the small silver in the shop, it’s over."

Li Er replied with an "mm."

Fortunately, the person who entered was her daughter, Li Liu.

The woman immediately stepped on Li Er's foot, "If a thief really comes, it’s likely to be a skinny little monkey. We can’t rely on you, Li Er! When the time comes, who will protect whom?"

The woman scolded him as they extinguished the lamp and headed to the backyard. Eventually, she ran out of steam and went to sleep.

Li Er and Li Liu sat on a long bench. Li Liu conjured a pot of celestial wine, and Li Er shook his head.

If he truly enjoyed drinking, he could have that good wine anytime.

However, this time, Li Liu insisted, "Father, let’s make an exception this once."

Li Er was a bit surprised. He accepted the pot of wine but did not unseal it, chuckling softly, "There’s plenty left over. I’ll save it to share with Li Huai. At his age, he can start drinking. When the time comes, I’ll tell him it’s a gift from the old immortal of Lion Peak."

Li Liu smiled but said nothing.

Li Er continued, "Your mother has thought many times about returning to Baoping Continent. After all, there are relatives and familiar neighbors there, unlike here, where we’re ultimately outsiders. So when your mother brought it up, I agreed. But later, your mother changed her mind, saying that Li Huai was studying in the academy. If someone bullies him, it wouldn’t be too excessive. You’re different; you’re a girl, and she worries about you being left here alone, not wanting to sever that celestial connection she dares not even dream of."

Li Liu nodded and gently intertwined her fingers, softly asking, "Father, have you ever thought that one day I would restore my true form? At that point, my divinity would far outweigh my humanity. All these past experiences would become as small as a mustard seed. I might not forget you and Mother and Li Huai, but I certainly wouldn’t care as much as I do now. What would happen then? I might not even feel a hint of sadness. What about you?"

Li Er smiled, "Of course, I've thought about such things. I’m not a fool. What would happen? There’s no need to overthink it. Just consider it a great achievement for my daughter. It’s like… well, it’s like a farmer’s parents, who toil all their lives, suddenly discovering that their son has become the top scholar, and their daughter has become a queen in the palace. The son is still their son, and the daughter is still their daughter. They might find less to talk about. The parents would remain in their old home, while their son worries about the country, and their daughter, as a queen, rarely visits. But the parents’ love and concern remain. If their children are doing well, they just want to know they are."

Li Liu lowered her head, "Is it really that simple?"

Li Er nodded, "It’s not that complicated, and you don’t need to complicate it in your mind. I didn’t tell you these things before because I thought it wouldn’t hurt to let you think more, even if it’s just nonsense."

Li Er hesitated for a moment, "However, I still hope that when that day comes, even if you’re stubborn and pretending, you should still treat your mother well. No matter who you truly are, to your mother, you will always be her child, whom she carried for ten months and raised with great difficulty. If you can promise me this, as your father, I won’t ask for anything more."

Li Liu softly replied, "Alright."

Li Er sighed, "What a pity that Chen Ping'an doesn’t like you, and you don’t like Chen Ping'an."

Li Liu complained, "Father!"

Li Er grinned, "I’m just saying a word; why get upset?"

Li Liu’s beautiful eyes turned into crescent moons as she laughed.

Li Er said, "Do you know why Chen Ping'an doesn’t live here? Is there something he can’t say?"

Li Liu questioned, "Is he worried about something? Afraid of causing us trouble?"

Li Er shook his head, "Our family is reunited, but there’s an outsider. Chen Ping'an can endure any hardship, but he can’t bear this."

That day, Li Liu returned home.

Chen Ping'an smiled as he bid farewell and left.

The young man in the green robe walked alone on the streets of a foreign land, turning to glance at the shop, his gaze lingering for a long time.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 662: A Word Left Unspoken (Part One)**

A ferry bound for the mountainous borders of the old Zhu Ying Dynasty made a stop at a dock called "Zhangyun."

Three figures—a man, another man, and a woman—quietly disembarked.

Wei Ban stood at the observation deck atop the ferry, watching the trio leave. As he approached the Zhu Ying Dynasty, it felt like stepping off his own mountain and onto someone else's territory. His sense of Peiyun Mountain diminished significantly; by the time he reached the Great Li’s new Zhongyue, he would feel even more overshadowed by the natural grandiosity. This was an unspoken rule all mountain and water deities had to obey: mountain gods wade through water, water gods ascend mountains, and both must tread carefully. Even a great mountain lord, when stepping outside his domain to visit colleagues, could not escape this reality.

However, even with this limitation, it was still manageable.

After all, Wei Ban was now the first mountain lord of the Fifth Realm in the history of Baoping Continent. That Zhongyue mountain lord, even if equivalent to the Jade Purity Realm, was still not a true deity of the Fifth Realm.

Leaving the northern borders of the Great Li, both for personal and official reasons, Wei Ban had a convincing explanation. Even if the Great Li court was not overly enthusiastic about his departure, they were willing to turn a blind eye.

Wei Ban’s introducer in the Great Li court was the wandering Mo Family knight, Xu Ruo.

Years ago, Wei Ban left Chess Pile Mountain alongside Xu Ruo, heading to Peiyun Mountain.

The hunched figure of Zhu Lian stood empty-handed.

The tall Lu Baixiang wore a narrow blade named "Tingxue" at his side.

On the dock, after disembarking, Liu Chongrun couldn’t help but speak to Zhu Lian, who walked beside him, “Mr. Zhu, it won’t be hard to find the Water Palace dragon boat. The Water Palace itself is manageable. It’s an ancient artifact fully refined by an immortal. I possess the method to gather this precious treasure, and when compacted, the Water Palace is only the size of a cart, which can be transported onto the ferry. However, that dragon boat has only reached minor refinement. To bring it back to Longquan County, we’ll have to spend some immortal money, treating the dragon boat as a ferry and parading it through the streets.”

Zhu Lian smiled, “No worries. The Great Li cavalry will have specialists to escort us in our treasure hunt. After that, we’ll ride the dragon boat back to Shabby Mountain without any hindrance.”

Liu Chongrun chuckled wryly, “Mr. Zhu, you aren’t joking, are you?”

Zhu Lian replied solemnly, “Master Liu is the leader of a sect and a golden elixir earth immortal. As an old man, I wouldn’t dare to be reckless.”

Liu Chongrun felt he had no choice but to take it one step at a time.

The matter of the Water Palace dragon boat had always been a headache for Liu Chongrun.

To whom should it be gifted? It was a significant subject. Even if he handed it over, a careless mistake could lead to a disastrous future for Zhu Chai Island, one where it wouldn’t find peace for a hundred years. Whether they could even preserve the ancestral hall was debatable.

Before conducting business with Shabby Mountain, in order to maintain a foothold at Shujian Lake and not be annexed by the True Realm Sect as a vassal island, Liu Chongrun weighed the pros and cons and disclosed information about the Water Palace to the True Realm Sect. Zhu Chai Island, being under someone else's roof, had no choice but to lower its head. Liu Chongrun deemed it a loss to avert disaster. The True Realm Sect, being a branch of the dominant Yu Gui Sect in Tongye Continent, truly showed no ill will and did not resort to underhanded tactics like murder or monopolizing treasures. Not only did Zhu Chai Island manage to retain its ancestral hall, but it also received a peace and safety certificate issued by the Great Li’s punishment department for its cultivators, which was the reason Liu Chongrun did not personally visit Shabby Mountain this time, instead sending several direct disciples familiar with Chen Ping’an.

However, subsequent developments exceeded expectations. Strangely enough, the True Realm Sect abandoned its pursuit of the Water Palace. Moreover, the peace certificate was not taken back from Zhu Chai Island. For this, Liu Chongrun made a cautious trip to Gongliu Island, where he, of course, did not meet the elusive Jiang Zongzhu but saw Liu Laocheng, the chief worshiper of the True Realm Sect. Liu Laocheng said this was the sect master’s decision, reassuring Liu Chongrun that the certificate would not be dangerous, and in a few words, dismissed Liu Chongrun.

When he left Gongliu Island, was he at ease? Not in the slightest.

But he was helpless; it couldn’t be that the True Realm Sect had to accept the Water Palace.

Thus, Liu Chongrun ultimately decided to relocate to Longquan County to personally visit Shabby Mountain, choosing a site on the back of the crab fish and discussing confidential matters there. Liu Chongrun did not intentionally conceal the news that the True Realm Sect had learned about the Water Palace dragon boat and even mentioned the sect's decision. The chief steward Zhu Lian appeared somewhat strange at the time, also assuring Master Liu to rest easy. Zhu Lian guaranteed that even if Shabby Mountain didn’t dig for treasures, at the very least, this information would not leak to anyone, ensuring that the cultivators of Zhu Chai Island would not fall into trouble due to possessing a treasure.

Liu Chongrun still didn’t dare to rest easy.

At this moment, truly stepping onto the path of treasure hunting in his homeland, Liu Chongrun felt a mix of emotions. If it weren’t for the chance to see the Water Palace dragon boat again, he would likely never set foot on this heart-wrenching land again in his lifetime.

As for the choice regarding the Water Palace dragon boat, Liu Chongrun had no hesitation.

The Water Palace was the foundation of a sect, a natural immortal cave that encompassed the ancestral hall, the earth immortal cultivation site, and the mountain-water formation. Placed next to the water of Shujian Lake, even earth immortal cultivators would drool over it, and it was enough to support a nascent soul cultivator in their practices. Thus, when the True Realm Sect handed Liu Chongrun a peace certificate of immense value without a word, it was a gesture of sincerity.

That enormous dragon boat, while not capable of crossing continents, was sufficient to transport large quantities of goods within one continent. For a small sect like Zhu Chai Island, it was more of a burden, but for the ambitious Shabby Mountain, it was a timely relief.

While Liu Chongrun was lost in thought, Lu Baixiang was secretly conversing with Zhu Lian using their martial arts’ sound transmission technique. Lu Baixiang smiled and asked, “Even if you successfully retrieve the dragon boat, you’ll still be running around everywhere. Won’t that delay your cultivation? Becoming a figurehead for Shabby Mountain means you can’t act recklessly as that martial madman anymore. Isn’t that uncomfortable?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “I’m busy every day, and I’m quite content.”

Lu Baixiang replied, “If you, Zhu Lian, have ulterior motives and things go awry, even if Chen Ping’an lets you off due to old ties, I will personally kill you.”

Zhu Lian said, “You won’t have that opportunity.”

Lu Baixiang questioned, “Are you saying I’m destined not to kill you, or that you’re genuinely behaving yourself at Shabby Mountain?”

Zhu Lian countered, “What kind of talent and ambition does Lu Jiaozhu possess? Historically, Lu Baixiang from the Lotus Flower Abode is decisive in battle. Why have you become so chatty?”

Lu Baixiang fell silent.

In that world, Lu Baixiang was the elder, while Zhu Lian was a later generation.

Zhu Lian smiled, “It turns out only our young master truly understands me; even Cui Dongshan can only be considered half right. As for you three fellow countrymen, you’re even less capable.”

Lu Baixiang merely smiled, gently stroking the hilt of his narrow blade.

Zhu Lian glanced at Lu Baixiang’s small gesture and remarked, “Do you believe you can even draw your sword now?”

Lu Baixiang laughed, “Not particularly.”

Zhu Lian said, “Let’s find an opportunity to practice together?”

Lu Baixiang shook his head, “Let’s hold off for now; we can discuss it in a few years.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “I’m not afraid of you, Lu Jiaozhu. The heavens are high and the emperor is far away. You’ve been living comfortably in such a remote place; it’s easy to lose track of reality.”

Lu Baixiang turned to look at Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian met his gaze, “Lu Baixiang, there has never been a realm of cultivators in the Lotus Flower Abode. Entering the vast world filled with ghosts and deities, especially in recent years, have you always kept your sword close? Why? With your sword in hand, does that mean you own the world? Why not be straightforward and learn from Sui Youbian, directly pursue immortality? Wouldn’t that be better?”

Lu Baixiang frowned, “Do you need to be wary of fights while hiding in Shabby Mountain? How can you compare with me?”

Zhu Lian scoffed, “Practicing martial arts is a personal matter; don’t ask me. The answers, whether pleasant or unpleasant, I can tell you whatever you want to hear. As for the truth, you’ll have to ask yourself.”

Lu Baixiang sighed, “It’s somewhat troublesome.”

Zhu Lian smiled, “In a small place with good aptitude and fortune, if there’s some impurity, it won’t manifest. But when you arrive in a grand world, it becomes evident. Among us four, I find you the most agreeable. If you’re pleasant, I’ll say a few less words.”

Lu Baixiang nodded, indicating he understood.

Even though Liu Chongrun didn’t know what the two were discussing, he felt a momentary chill from the sudden murderous intent Lu Baixiang had displayed, enough to make even him, a golden elixir earth immortal, feel a pang of anxiety.

And who was Lu Baixiang? Merely a name on the ancestry list of Shabby Mountain's ancestral hall.

Liu Chongrun felt somewhat melancholic, wondering when Zhu Chai Island could truly become a stable sect of immortals. One where they wouldn’t need to watch their backs or rent mountains?

Bringing all the direct disciples and leaving only a hollow ancestral hall at Shujian Lake, relocating to Longquan County and establishing a residence on the back of the crab fish, was it truly a wise choice?

At present, Liu Chongrun didn’t know the answer.

What he did know was that Zhu Lian and Lu Baixiang nearby were both top-notch martial arts masters. In the history of Baoping Continent, they would be esteemed guests in any dynasty, not to be taken lightly. Their hard fists were one reason, but more importantly, they were warriors of the three realms of spirit refinement, already entangled with a nation’s martial destiny. They carried an influence that was not inferior to that of mountain and water deities in solidifying local fortunes; in some cases, it might even surpass them.

However, Liu Chongrun could not gauge what realms Zhu Lian and Lu Baixiang had attained, and as for who was stronger, he had no means to ascertain, as he hadn’t yet witnessed their true prowess in action.

His impression of Zhu Lian was more of Shabby Mountain’s steward, always wearing a smile when interacting with others. Although he had dealt with him a few times, Liu Chongrun understood little about him; oddly enough, the more they met, the more obscured he felt.

On the other hand, Lu Baixiang was clearly a figure not to be trifled with, exuding an extraordinary aura that even a blind man could perceive.

Liu Chongrun realized that Shabby Mountain seemed to harbor many hidden secrets. Whenever there was an opportunity to interact, one mystery after another would emerge, overwhelming one’s senses.

The northern mountain lord Wei Ban of the Great Li was a frequent visitor to Shabby Mountain. That hunchbacked man with a dubious gaze showed no sign of respect towards Wei Ban.

The shopkeeper surnamed Shi at the New Year’s store in Qilong Alley had a peculiar appearance, seemingly carrying a faint aura of the supernatural, making it impossible for Liu Chongrun to gauge the depth of his cultivation.

Chen Ruchu, Chen Lingjun, and Zhou Mili, three peculiar creatures, especially the young boy in green, seemed to be nearing a bottleneck in the Longmen realm. Once he broke through to the golden elixir realm, he would be a formidable entity, comparable to any ordinary golden elixir cultivator. However, it appeared that Chen Lingjun was the least favored in Shabby Mountain, and he didn’t seem to find anything unusual about being neglected. If it were at Shujian Lake, he would have revolted by now.

Liu Chongrun sometimes wondered if that young mountain lord aspired to rise to fame and transform the formerly obscure Shabby Mountain of Longquan County into a prominent sect. Did he intend to compete with the Longquan Sword Sect of the sage Ruan Qiong?

Wasn’t that a bit idealistic?

After all, Shabby Mountain had many martial artists but few cultivators, and it was hard to discern who among them had the potential to ascend to the Fifth Realm.

In contrast, the neighboring Longquan Sword Sect, despite having few cultivators, was not to be underestimated. Not to mention Sage Ruan Qiong himself, Dong Gu had already reached the golden elixir realm. As for Ruan Qiong’s only daughter, Ruan Xiu, Liu Chongrun had heard some fantastical rumors since his arrival at Shujian Lake. One night, he had witnessed the strange phenomena of that island from a distance and learned that Ruan Xiu, alongside an enigmatic youth clad in white, had once jointly hunted down an old golden elixir sword cultivator of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, a tale that was simply astonishing.

Moreover, a renowned mountain cannot accommodate two golden elixirs; far from allies, they could easily become rivals—an unspoken rule in the mountains for centuries.

Even though the territory of Longquan County was not small and rich in spiritual energy, it still could not support two thriving sects of immortals.

Strangely, Zhu Lian, who had never been to the immortal ferry, appeared quite familiar with it. As soon as the three of them left the Zhangyun dock, Liu Chongrun spotted a small troop of elite cavalry—just over twenty riders.

But it sent a shiver down Liu Chongrun's spine.

At the forefront were three riders, with a young man in the center, looking weary from travel. His expression was calm, and he wasn't clad in armor, but a Great Li-patterned war knife hung from his waist.

Next to him was a handsome young man in a black robe, casually wielding twin swords, who was yawning while perched on his horse.

On the other side was a burly man.

Liu Chongrun felt that aside from the central commander, the other two were quite dangerous.

As for the Great Li cavalry, Liu Chongrun, being a former princess of a fallen kingdom, had presided over state affairs for many years, managing household matters and even ruling the kingdom, so she was naturally an expert in discerning the martial prowess of these elite cavalrymen at a glance.

The Great Li cavalry were not only willing to bravely face death on the battlefield but also exuded an aura of discipline and order.

This was clearly a testament to the meticulous training by National Master Cui Qian.

Zhu Lian raised his head to look at the dark-skinned man, rubbing his hands together as he said, “Isn’t this our Wu Xuanlang, Lord Wei?”

The man, referred to as Wu Xuanlang by Zhu Lian, remained indifferent.

The young man in the center turned to smile, “Brother Wei, who is this elder?”

The man answered with a straight face, “My surname is Zhu, given name Lian. An old acquaintance from my hometown, a martial madman. Currently in the distant travel realm, serving as a steward in Longquan County.”

The young man seemed taken aback.

An eighth realm master? 

Why had he never heard of him? He was acutely aware of all the distant travel realm martial artists in the Great Li; most had thrown themselves into battlefields, and hardly anyone remained in the rivers and lakes.

As for eighth realm qi practitioners, he was indifferent to hearing about them.

He was born into a prominent warrior family in Great Li, from the renowned Chier Street of the capital, and had always held little fondness for cultivators. He naturally felt a kinship with martial artists, whether on the battlefield or in the rivers and lakes.

His ancestors had carved the land and built the family’s estate with nothing but fists and blades.

As for himself, he was just like Liu Xuanmei and his good friend Guan Yiran, who looked down upon the leeches lying in bed enjoying the fruits of their ancestors’ labors. Liu Xuanmei’s name was personally bestowed by the elder Guan.

Many of the spoiled sons from Yichi Lane and Chier Street could not be raised; under their parents’ arrangements, they would gather wealth in the yamen and help local tyrants make connections, or recommend mountain immortals to serve prestigious families. They spent their days attending endless banquets and social gatherings. Although they were treated like lords in the capital's official circles and banquets, always accompanied by female servants who were immortal cultivators, take them to Chier Street, and how many would shrink back and speak softly?

Liu Xuanmei dismounted and bowed with a smile, “Liu Xuanmei, greetings to Elder Zhu!”

Zhu Lian quickly returned the gesture, cheerfully saying, “General Liu, young and promising, with ample confidence in offering incense to the ancestors at the ancestral hall.”

Liu Xuanmei laughed, feeling no offense in Zhu Lian mentioning the incense of his ancestors.

The commander dismounted, and Wei Xuan followed suit, with the rest of the elite cavalry dismounting one after another.

Only the young swordsman with phoenix-like eyes continued to squat on his horse, nodding and clicking his tongue, “A formidable wind control realm, indeed. Wei Xuan, your hometown has produced remarkable talents. This is a fact that can be said in Niping Lane.”

The swordsman was Cao Jun.

Cao Jun was a native of Southern Bosa Continent, but his ancestral family, Cao Xi, originated from the Niping Lane in Liyu Cave Heaven.

Lu Baixiang, who had been standing behind Zhu Lian and Liu Chongrun, now stood shoulder to shoulder with Zhu Lian.

Wei Xuan nodded at Lu Baixiang, who smiled back in greeting.

After leaving Cui Dongshan, Wei Xuan had joined the Great Li military, becoming a cultivator among the elite cavalry. With his experience in genuine perilous battles, he was temporarily serving as a squad leader, just waiting for orders from the Ministry of War. Once he received the title of Wu Xuanlang from Lord Wei, he would be promoted to standard leader right away. Of course, if Wei Xuan wished to personally command the troops, he could be promoted to a sixth-rank military officer on the spot, leading a battalion of over a thousand soldiers.

The type of squad leaders in the Great Li were likely the most esteemed in the world; they could meet all military officers below the third rank on the road without needing to bow. If they felt like it, they could merely clasp their fists in greeting; if they didn’t want to, they could ignore them altogether.

Wei Xuan had now attained the sixth rank among the twelve ranks of military titles in the Great Li cavalry, the Wu Xuanlang, with the top five military titles typically awarded to military officers with outstanding battlefield achievements. In a state like Great Li, built on martial prowess, the highest military rank has always been that of the Zhulang, yet this revered title wasn’t necessarily restricted to martial artists.

Cao Jun was always Wei Xuan’s superior, overseeing all the accompanying cultivators within a grand army of over ten thousand elite cavalrymen. Although Wei Xuan was merely a squad leader, he acted somewhat like Cao Jun’s deputy. According to Cao Jun, a man of leisure, he preferred not to overthink matters, so he often dumped the troublesome tasks of commanding troops onto Wei Xuan. Wei Xuan was considered a military cultivator, but he resembled a pure martial artist. Initially, there were some criticisms, with people suspecting he was simply a retainer of some bigwig in the Ministry of War, trying to cling to military achievements after the war ended. However, after a few battles, the rumors subsided. The reason was simple: all the accompanying cultivators who fought alongside Wei Xuan had survived.

The Great Li cavalry prepared their mounts, and everyone rode off towards the treasure’s hiding place, located a little over two hundred miles from Zhangyun dock. The Water Palace dragon boat was buried at the bottom of a river, in a highly concealed secret passage. Only Liu Chongrun possessed many methods to crack the mountain and water restrictions, otherwise, even if they found the treasure vault, without destroying the water transport mountain’s root, they would be unable to enter the secret realm. However, if they did so, they would trigger the mechanism, causing the Water Palace dragon boat to collapse along with it.

When Liu Chongrun learned that the young commander Liu Xuanmei was not yet thirty and had already attained the fourth rank of military officer in the Great Li, he was even more astonished.

On one hand, he was surprised at the rapid advancement in this individual’s career; in the Great Li, elevating military officers required substantial military merit, which was a hard and fast rule. Those born into esteemed military families might have a head start, but they still needed merit.

On the other hand, he was astonished by the connections and influence in Shabby Mountain’s official circles. Since a military officer was present, a nod of approval would undoubtedly come from a high-ranking, powerful general. Even if it wasn’t the already appointed Inspecting Envoy Cao Ping or Su Gaoshan, it would surely be a prominent general of Great Li, just below the two.

In fact, it wasn’t only Liu Chongrun who found it hard to comprehend; even Liu Xuanmei himself was puzzled. This time he was leading the team based on the orders conveyed directly by a trusted aide of General Cao Ping. Among the riders, there were even two spies from Green Wave Pavilion monitoring the military, indicating that they were not watching the actions of the trio but rather observing whether Liu Xuanmei would stir up unnecessary trouble.

This was rather intriguing. Was it possible that the newly appointed Inspecting Envoy Cao Ping had a keen eye and intended to collude with some high-ranking figure from Green Wave Pavilion for personal gain? Then General Cao chose to stay behind the scenes, sending his trusted aide to handle the matter personally? If so, such audacity required Liu Xuanmei to replace him with other loyal generals. If Liu Xuanmei believed this action went against the military laws of the Great Li, he would have to report it to the court, even if it meant being secretly executed by Cao Ping to seal his mouth. How could he handle the aftermath? The Liu family of Chier Street was not a family that Cao Ping could treat lightly. The key was that this act broke the established rules. For a hundred years, regardless of their family backgrounds, methods, or personalities, the literati and military have long been accustomed to following the rules in major affairs.

If the court were to pursue responsibility and execute that trusted aide to take the blame? This did not seem to align with General Cao’s style.

Yet to say that someone was so influential that even Cao Ping had to comply, orchestrating a plan personally equivalent to that of a pillar in the court, Liu Xuanmei found it hard to believe. Was it possible that it was the National Master’s intention?

Was it necessary to go to such lengths for a mere mountain treasure? 

The Great Li cavalry headed south, collecting various items from the mountains, accumulating a mountain of treasures. Thousands of mountain and water temples were destroyed and forbidden, all following the established regulations of the Great Li.

Was this one particular case worth it?

Liu Xuanmei was filled with curiosity.

And he hoped to stay alive to discover that answer.

Liu Xuanmei and Liu Chongrun rode side by side, discussing the route.

Wei Xuan and Lu Baixiang followed closely behind, reminiscing about past events.

Lu Baixiang was the one among the four who appeared the easiest to get along with, chatting easily with everyone.

The other three hardly exchanged words with one another.

Zhu Lian unexpectedly found himself happily chatting with Cao Jun at the back of the riding team, treating each other like brothers, discussing various topics. Of course, two older men wouldn’t chat much about women.

No matter what Cao Jun said, Zhu Lian’s responses never hit the mark for him. Even if this old cook wasn’t skilled in culinary arts, he wouldn’t know how to serve others.

Cao Jun’s eyes gleamed, almost wanting to leave the military and serve at Shabby Mountain.

Li Xisheng, accompanied by his young attendant Cui Ci, returned to a state city in Qinghao Kingdom after leaving the northern Qingliang Sect. Qinghao Kingdom was a small, remote nation in the North Julu Continent, but it wasn’t a significant vassal state.

In the state city, Li Xisheng purchased a small residence on a street named “Dongxian.” Across the street lived a family surnamed Chen, a prosperous household—not one of the high-ranking families from the capital. Among them was a peer of Li Xisheng, coincidentally named Chen Baozhou, a leisurely scholar without any examination titles, skilled in the arts of the piano, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Li Xisheng often traveled with this person, though they never ventured far.

Li Xisheng had come to the North Julu Continent from Baoping Continent, journeying northwards before stopping here. He had leveraged some connections to secure a position as a clerk in a state education office. Before heading to Qingliang Sect, Li Xisheng would pass by the “Kai Tian Wen Yun” archway next to the office every day; the office wasn’t small, with twelve courtyards.

The education officer took a liking to Li Xisheng, considering him a knowledgeable young outsider. Of course, the education officer was known as a clear-cut literati who had suddenly risen from a pure water yamen to a central figure in the court, which certainly involved some “knowledge.” One time, during a drinking session with Li Xisheng, he slipped him some of that “knowledge,” which the education officer discreetly accepted.

The next day, Li Xisheng became a clerk in the education office.

At first, Cui Ci was astounded, wondering why his illustrious teacher would engage in such actions. Was it appropriate for a scholar to act so mercantile?

Li Xisheng offered no explanation to Cui Ci.

Upon returning to the state city, Li Xisheng’s position in the education office was already vacated. They gave him some vague excuse and dismissed him from his clerk role.

Li Xisheng didn’t mind.

On their way back, Cui Ci asked his master how long they would stay in Qinghao Kingdom. Li Xisheng replied it would be a long time, at least thirty or forty years.

Cui Ci was initially a bit anxious, fearing it might be hundreds of years. Upon hearing it was only thirty or forty years, he felt a great sense of relief.

After all, he and his master were no longer mere mortals from the mountains.

As for Cui Ci, every time he thought about his origins, a sense of lingering sorrow would creep in. But whenever he worried about it, he would feel less troubled, for he had those worries.

That day, Li Xisheng once again spread out a painting, admiring the mirror flowers and water moons.

Cui Ci, knowing his master’s habits, had already prepared incense. In truth, Li Xisheng had no interest in such ostentation, but Cui Ci enjoyed it, so he didn’t stop him.

On the painting, an old sage was seated, discussing the Dao. The sage was a wise man from Yuhua Academy. Initially, Cui Ci listened attentively to the first few lessons, but soon found them tedious, filled with redundant details. Each lecture would only convey one principle, yet he would twist and turn, reiterating various minor points about that principle. Cui Ci found it extremely uninteresting; who wouldn’t understand these simple principles after studying for a few days? Was it necessary for the sage to elaborate so much?

No wonder later, when his master took him to Yuhua Academy, he learned that this old sage had been ridiculed as a pedant, considered the least capable among the academy’s wise men. Eventually, when it came to teaching, the academy’s Confucian students could not tolerate it anymore, prompting the old sage to be assigned this role—responsible for the mirror flowers and water moons at the academy. Not only did the academy know this was just a formality, but even the old sage himself likely understood that no one would listen to his drivel. Yet, he continued for thirty years, relishing in the leisure. Sometimes, he would bring along a few of his favorite books, notes, and calligraphy, choosing a line to speak off the cuff based on his mood.

Cui Ci, in the bustling streets of Yuhua Academy filled with bookstores, had heard an array of old stories about the sage. It was said that he had gained the title of wise man purely by chance, unrelated to his learning. Initially, many clever individuals began to befriend the then-young sage, engaging in poetic exchanges. Scholars from various nations and local academies eagerly invited him to teach. In the end, even the bureaucracy lost interest in him. His calligraphy and couplets, initially worth a thousand taels of silver, dwindled to mere hundreds, and now, even ten taels would hardly find a buyer, let alone be accepted as a gift.

Yet, Cui Ci noticed that every time his master listened to the sage’s lectures, he never missed a session. Even during the time when the sage taught the nine named disciples of Zongzhu He at Qingliang Sect, he would still attend the mirror flowers and water moons at Yuhua Academy.

In the painting, the old sage, seated in the same position for thirty years, cleared his throat, picked up a newly acquired book—a travelogue—and quickly announced the title, stating he would discuss the sentence “The small stove in the countryside is just lit, while peach and plum trees in the temple are shedding blossoms,” exploring its brilliance. He questioned the redundancy of the terms “countryside” and “temple,” his face slightly reddening, looking a bit awkward, as he held the book high, as if wanting the audience to see the title more clearly.

With a helpless expression, Cui Ci remarked, “Master, is this old sage going to starve? Why is he even selling books for the bookstore?”

Li Xisheng smiled and replied, “It’s his first time; it has never happened before. He probably couldn’t refuse an old friend's request.”

Cui Ci sighed, “A wise man should have reached this level, and it’s indeed time to feel embarrassed.”

Cui Ci chuckled, “But today, the old sage finally isn’t lecturing on those abstract principles. That’s good, otherwise, I’d surely be dozing off after a stick of incense.”

Listening to the old sage preach about poetry, Li Xisheng asked, “Who says knowledge must be useful to be good knowledge?”

Cui Ci mistakenly thought he had misheard, “Master?”

Li Xisheng continued looking at the painting, listening to the sage’s words. He smiled at Cui Ci, saying, “Cui Ci, let me ask you a small question: How much does one tael weigh compared to two kinds of weight?”

Cui Ci was increasingly perplexed; wasn’t that a question?

Li Xisheng went on, “Who set the rules for those two weights? Who were the ones holding the scale and the weights thousands of years ago? Will there be any discrepancies now or in the future? If even a slight error occurs, how will it affect the movement of all things in this world?”

Cui Ci pondered for a moment, feeling a headache coming on.

Li Xisheng slowly said, “Some pure knowledge appears distant from the mundane world, but that doesn’t mean it’s without value. There are always seemingly useless studies that need someone to pursue them. When I talk to you, can it help you earn a copper coin? Or improve your cultivation by even a little?”

Cui Ci shook his head, “Not really.”

Li Xisheng gazed at the aging old scholar in the painting, feeling a tinge of sadness. He withdrew his gaze, turning toward the “non-human” youth pieced together from fragments of pottery. He said, “Refining spiritual energy for personal use, ascending step by step to transcendence and immortality is the essence of cultivation. Confucians, by repaying society with their moral teachings and scholarly knowledge, influence the mundane world. This is the essence of Confucian persuasion, like gentle spring winds that quietly nourish without a sound, reaching the ultimate realm of knowledge.”

After a moment of silence, Li Xisheng looked at the incense curling above the incense burner, saying, “To gather is to unite heaven and humanity, achieving eternal life. To disperse, since ancient sages have always been lonely, leaving behind their writings for hundreds of years. True disciples of Confucius never seek only to live long.”

The old sage was indeed aging. As he spoke, he grew weary; in the past, he could drone on for half an hour after an hour of lecturing.

Yet today, after half an hour, he lost the drive to continue, the old sage appeared sorrowful, gazing into the distance, muttering to himself, “I actually know no one is listening, no one is listening to me speak these things.”

The old man softly said, “Twenty years ago, when listening to the mountain lord preach, I would occasionally feel a surge of inspiration. Ten years ago, it became rare; every time I heard someone willing to spend money on my meager knowledge, I would feel the need to go drink…”

At this point, the old man forced a smile, grabbing that travelogue, “It’s precisely this book that’s been sold for money. In the blink of an eye, after very few drinks, we all grew old.”

“In recent years, I haven’t been able to help the academy earn even a single copper coin through my knowledge, which weighs heavily on my conscience.” 

The old man’s expression was bleak as he put down the book and suddenly laughed in anger, “That old rascal Qian, I know you’re watching. You’re afraid I won’t help you sell books, aren’t you?! Damn it, put your damn leg down. If you won’t, at least leave some food after the feast, so I can have a couple of bites after I leave the academy.”

The old man stood up and bowed, “This lecture is my last act of humiliation at the academy. It’s better that no one listens, so I don’t waste money. Cultivating in the mountains is not easy; my thirty years of knowledge truly has little use. Look at me, in this state, do I look like a scholar or a learned person? I myself don’t even think so.”

The old sage was about to put away the mirror flowers and water moons when suddenly, Li Xisheng gently tossed a Gu Yu coin, stood up, and bowed, saying, “Scholar Li Xisheng, I have benefited greatly. Thank you, elder.”

The old sage was stunned, standing there for a long time, and even felt a bit teary-eyed, waving his hand, “I’m undeserving, undeserving.”

Then the old man, feeling a bit embarrassed, mistakenly thought someone had tossed a small Shu coin. He muttered, “That travelogue is definitely not worth buying. It’s overvalued; it’s far too expensive! Even with immortal money, it shouldn’t be spent so lavishly. In the grand scheme of things, the essentials of cultivating self and family should be addressed in small matters…”

Habitually about to drone on with those grand principles, the old sage suddenly closed his mouth, his expression forlorn. He self-deprecatingly said, “Let’s not talk about it anymore.”

Suddenly, a third person tossed a Gu Yu coin but did not throw it, instead calling out, “This lecture is the worst, but your skill at selling books is impressive. Why not open a bookstore yourself? I, Zhou Mi, would be willing to buy a few.”

The old sage lowered his voice, tentatively asking, “Is that you, Lord Zhou?”

The person chuckled, “Otherwise? Who else in North Julu Continent could say ‘I, Zhou Mi,’ so confidently?”

The old sage hurriedly ran off to close the opened sage's book, not wanting the three to see his embarrassment.

An old scholar, after all, still cared about his reputation. 

**(End of Chapter)**

 **Chapter 663: Unspoken Words (Part Two)**

As the Mountain Lord Wei Bo was departing from Cloudy Peak, a grand convoy set off from Huaihuang Town in Longquan County, relocating the entire family. It wasn't that they couldn't afford to travel to Ox Horn Mountain to board the celestial ferry; it was simply that someone hadn't given their approval. This left a woman, who held significant sway over the family's finances, feeling quite regretful. After all, she had never experienced a celestial ferry ride in her lifetime.

But there was nothing she could do; her son had made up his mind, and as his mother, she had no choice but to go along with it.

The Ma family of Xinghua Alley, after the death of the old matriarch, saw her grandson quickly leave the small town, leaving the ancestral home empty. Meanwhile, the old matriarch's two sons and their wives had long since moved out of the ancestral home in Xinghua Alley. The Ma family was wealthy but kept a low profile, much like Lin Shouyi's father, who worked in the kiln supervision bureau; he held power but chose not to flaunt it, leaving others with the impression of merely being a lowly clerk. The two families shared a similar fate.

After moving out of Xinghua Alley years ago, the Ma couple did not purchase property on Fulu Street or Taoye Alley. Instead, they had quietly sold their ancestral Dragon Kiln to the wealthy Xu family in Qingfeng City for a handsome price. Under their son's arrangement, the entire family was relocating to the territory of Zhenwu Mountain, one of the ancestral grounds of martial families, intending to settle there for generations to come. The woman was, in fact, reluctant, and her husband was equally disinterested. The couple had hoped to settle in the capital of Dali, but their son had insisted they follow his wishes. After all, he was no longer the foolish boy from Xinghua Alley; he was Ma Kuxuan, the most outstanding cultivation talent in Baoping Continent, known for having killed two renowned Golden Core sword cultivators from the Zhurou Dynasty.

As the woman lifted the carriage curtain, she spotted a strikingly beautiful young woman on horseback, who was now her son's maid. Her son had given her the name "Shudian," which the woman found amusing, as it reminded her that her son still had a bit of that foolishness from years ago.

The young woman, known as Shudian, sensed the woman's gaze and initially tried to ignore it. However, a young man at the front of the horse convoy turned to look back, his expression cold and indifferent. Startled, she quickly turned to the carriage, softly asking, “Madam, do you need to stop for a rest?”

The woman shook her head with a smile, slowly lowering the curtain. Shudian stole a glance at the young man's back, feeling a deep sorrow that she dared not reveal. 

Years ago, she had entered the Lihuzhu Cave with the Xu family from Qingfeng City and a group of mountain apes from Zhengyang Mountain, all seeking fortune. In the end, she was the one who suffered the most. She had gained nothing from the fateful opportunity and had instead drawn a grave misfortune upon herself—a veritable family massacre. Her grandfather, the owner of the Haichao Iron Cavalry, had lost his kingdom to the unstoppable forces of the Dali army. He had relinquished his military power but managed to retain his official status within the court, allowing him to return to his hometown. Yet, it was at that moment that this young man appeared.

Upon returning home, the escort sent by the court, along with her grandfather's personal troops, numbering over a hundred, had all perished, their bodies strewn across the ground. She knelt there with the old man, and Ma Kuxuan stood between them, pressing his hand on their heads, saying that two heads could not repay their debts. Even if the entire Haichao Iron Cavalry were wiped out, it would still not suffice. 

Ma Kuxuan asked the old man what should be done next. The old man began to bow his head, pleading for Ma Kuxuan to spare his granddaughter, only asking for his own life in return. After a lifetime of military exploits, he never imagined he would meet such an end, while the young woman beside him remained frozen in place.

Ma Kuxuan then struck down, leaving behind a gruesome and lifeless body. In the end, he spared her life, keeping her by his side and bestowing upon her the name "Shudian," without a surname. 

Lost and dazed, Shudian ultimately followed Ma Kuxuan to Longquan County. Along the way, the young man, who had taken many lives without remorse, went first to the banks of the Longxu River, where it met the Iron Talisman River. There, Shudian witnessed the emergence of a deity holding a sword, the first among the water gods of Dali, named Yanghua. 

Ma Kuxuan sat at the river's edge, tossing stones into the water. He smiled at the high-ranking deity, saying, “I know you are a servant of the Empress Dowager, while I am merely the grandson of the river god beneath your command. Generally, I should show you some respect. However, I have heard that you have not treated my grandmother kindly. So you should be cautious. In life, whether one is a cultivator or a deity, debts must be repaid. The next time I return to visit my grandmother, if you still haven’t cleared your debt and dare to act arrogantly toward the Longxu River, I will bind your golden body to Zhenwu Mountain and refine it daily. For every essence of incense I feed you, you will owe me a thousand years in suffering. Even if I, Ma Kuxuan, should perish, as long as Zhenwu Mountain stands, you will endure a thousand years of torment; not a day less, or I, Ma Kuxuan, will consider it a loss."

The water deity Yanghua scoffed. 

Ma Kuxuan added, “Since you have become a great river deity, you shouldn’t fear suffering. However, being a woman, some traits are hard to eradicate. I will occasionally capture some lustful spirit deities or mountain monsters and take them to Zhenwu Mountain to teach them long-lost divine arts, allowing them to turn misfortune into fortune, so you may understand what it means to repay debts.”

In conclusion, Ma Kuxuan said, “I tell you this in hopes that you will not be foolish enough to think that small matters are insignificant. Otherwise, my breakthroughs will be swift, and you will find yourself repaying debts just as quickly.” 

The Iron Talisman River deity did not respond, merely wearing a mocking smile. 

Ma Kuxuan tilted his head, “You don’t believe me, do you?” 

With a smile, he added, “Then just wait. I’ve changed my mind. Soon there will come a day when the Empress Dowager herself will issue a decree, placing you in charge of the great river, and I will visit you as a guest. I hope the river goddess will extend a warm welcome, and in return, I will invite you to the mountain to visit.” 

Yanghua’s expression grew serious. 

Ma Kuxuan shook his head, “Sorry, it’s too late.” 

Yanghua narrowed her eyes. 

A guardian from Zhenwu Mountain appeared behind Ma Kuxuan, smiling slightly. “River goddess, killing without permission is against the rules.” 

Yanghua coldly replied, “Is Ma Kuxuan already the lord of Zhenwu Mountain?” 

The martial sect cultivator shook his head, chuckling, “Naturally not. But it seems Ma Kuxuan’s words carry more weight than our mountain lord’s. I have long held a grudge, but there’s nothing I can do.” 

Yanghua noticed that the cultivator discreetly signaled her. 

With a sigh, Yanghua said to Ma Kuxuan, “Malanhua will soon have her own river deity temple.” 

Malanhua, the river goddess of Longxu, had been unable to construct a temple since her promotion to river deity. 

If the Iron Talisman River deity were to speak, it would be reasonable for the temple to be built. Both the local government of Longzhou and the Ministry of Rites of the Dali court would not make things difficult. 

Ma Kuxuan stood up, clapping his hands, “Alright, then I, Ma Kuxuan, will also change my stance. From now on, the river goddess will be my esteemed guest.” 

After this, the tall Ma Kuxuan, dressed in black with a white jade belt, appeared like a refined young master of a noble family wandering through the mountains. As he walked along the banks of the Longxu River, he no longer concealed his aura, purposefully letting it leak. Not long after, the water beneath began to stir, and aquatic plants swayed in the river, seemingly peering at the activities on the shore.

As if unwilling to acknowledge Ma Kuxuan, a woman whose appearance had lost its youth emerged from the water, gazing at the young man on the bank. The river goddess did not shed tears, but the woman instinctively wiped her face.

It was Shudian’s first time seeing the young demon Ma Kuxuan, who smiled brilliantly. She also discovered that even this stone-hearted villain could shed tears.

That day, Ma Kuxuan sat by the river, and Shudian sat beside him. The woman gently grasped Ma Kuxuan’s hand and began to murmur softly.

Ma Kuxuan sat there in silence for a long time, with a somewhat unfamiliar expression, yet it was the most familiar nagging he had ever heard in his life.

His grandmother spoke of many mundane family matters, scolding many people, only to ultimately tell him not to worry about anything.

At last, she asked her grandson to wait a moment and went to her humble abode by the water to gather all her accumulated belongings, neatly arranging them beside them. Piece by piece, she recounted their origins, insisting that Ma Kuxuan take everything away, saying these were her savings for his future wife. She just didn’t know if he had found any suitable girls over the years, but that Zhi Gui was nothing but a born seductress, certainly not a woman who could be married into the family. Besides her, she accepted any woman as her grandson’s wife.

Ma Kuxuan insisted it would be Zhi Gui.

The woman habitually reached out to poke her grandson’s forehead, scolding him for being bewitched, with no sense of what was good, a fool neglected by both father and mother, destined for a hard life.

Eventually, the woman spoke until she began to cry, lamenting the hardships she endured to become the river goddess, saying if it weren’t for the fact that she still had such a grandson, she would have found it unbearable to endure alone.

Ma Kuxuan took a deep breath and wiped his face. 

The woman insisted that Ma Kuxuan promise her one thing. He reassured her not to worry; if he were to trace the clues back to the Ma family in Xinghua Alley, it wouldn’t be a matter of just killing one person. If Chen Ping’an dared to kill someone, he would kill two people dear to him in return—there would be no less, only more. 

The woman shook her head, insisting that he promise her, her voice trembling in tears, saying they were still his parents, and debts should not be settled like this. 

Ma Kuxuan remained silent. 

In the end, the woman pulled out her trump card, saying if he didn’t agree, she would treat him as if she had no grandson from then on. 

With no choice, Ma Kuxuan had to agree, deep down calculating his own plans. So, after their farewell, he still didn’t go to find his parents but instead visited Yang's shop. After learning that his grandmother must stay by the Longxu River, this matter was non-negotiable, Ma Kuxuan had no choice but to change his mind and let his parents sell the ancestral Dragon Kiln at a high price, moving the entire family away from Longquan County. Thus began their leisurely journey away from home.

Throughout the journey, Shudian noticed something strange. 

For some reason, it seemed that Ma Kuxuan's relationship with his parents was quite ordinary, lacking the kind of aloofness one would expect from a celestial being. It was as if there had been little emotional connection from the start. After going to the mountains to cultivate, their relationship had grown even more distant. The couple appeared to be immersed in a huge sense of joy, while their son, who had achieved such greatness, hardly ever showed a smile, remaining taciturn. The couple didn’t see anything wrong with this; it seemed perfectly natural that their son was so exalted.

The couple, dressed like ordinary nobility, exuded a sense of opulence, while the woman had a pair of peach blossom eyes—not particularly striking in appearance, but even with a smile, her gaze still carried a hint of coldness.

Along the way, some unfortunate souls and monsters encountered misfortune and perished.

Ma Kuxuan seemed to deliberately choose routes through treacherous mountains and waters, targeting bandits and monsters to kill, relieving the agitation in his heart.

During this time, Shudian’s sect members came to rescue her for the second time. 

The first time was when the sect master personally came to confront Ma Kuxuan, who killed over ten of them right in front of her, crushing them like ants. 

Before Ma Kuxuan acted, he made her choose again—whether to live or to let them perish. 

If she chose incorrectly, she would die. 

Shudian chose correctly, and so those people perished. 

This time, it was a fellow disciple with whom she hoped to become a Dao partner, accompanied by some friends from the mountain, coming to save her from her dire situation. 

Again, Ma Kuxuan forced her to choose—whether to die with the doomed lovers or to survive alone. 

Shudian chose to live.

Thus, the brother she thought she loved, along with his friends, perished without question. 

During a heavy rain, Shudian completely broke down, sitting on the ground and loudly questioning why, when she had once sought death, Ma Kuxuan had refused, but after two more requests, he had granted her wish.

Ma Kuxuan, dressed in a long robe that remained dry despite the rain, smiled at her, saying, “The purpose was to make you wish for death. What’s unclear about that? Your confusion is why a celestial maiden is today sitting in the mud, wailing. Once you understand, you’ll live blissfully. All that has happened is not worth mentioning.”

Ma Kuxuan grabbed her head and threw her onto the horse, “As a maid, if you ever show disrespect again, I’ll cut out your tongue. This is the last warning.”

The convoy continued on its journey through the rain.

As spring faded into summer, the sun shone warmly.

Ma Kuxuan rode at the front of the convoy, idly swaying on his horse, silently calculating which upper five realms cultivators from Baoping Continent were unworthy of his attention. 

The Grand Master of Dali, Xiu Hu Cui Chan, didn’t count, as this old gentleman was genuinely a person of significance. 

Having hidden in the capital of Dali for many years, the master of the Mo family faction had managed to outlast the Yin-Yang family’s Lu clan cultivators, which was quite an achievement. 

The twelve massive mountain ferries, which Ma Kuxuan had personally witnessed, blocked out the sun overhead. Below them, the human realm spread out for hundreds of miles, engulfed in darkness. This was the fundamental reason why the Dali cavalry could rapidly advance southward; the construction of each enormous ferry was akin to cutting a large piece of flesh from the Dali court and the Song Emperor. Moreover, Dali also owed a significant debt to the major powers of the Central Plains, including the Mo family’s central lineage and the Shang family. The Dali cavalry’s actions in the south were essentially a means to secretly repay these debts, but when they would be fully repaid was uncertain. 

The Mo family wanderer named Xu Ruo should not be underestimated. 

The Heavenly Monarch Xie Shi of North Julu Continent had already set out to return, as remaining in Baoping Continent was meaningless. Moreover, it was rumored that this Heavenly Monarch had suspicions of a fire in his backyard; if he didn’t return to North Julu, it would be laughable. 

The rest seemed to be inconsequential existences; their deaths would merely return spiritual energy to the heavens and earth. Living merely meant being some mountain thieves with a bit of celestial ability, hoarding wealth without sharing. 

The Heavenly Monarch Qi Zhen of the Divine Decree Sect couldn’t even retain disciples as fortunate as He Xiaoliang. He broke her arms and legs, leaving her behind in the sect as a mere treasure hoard. 

The Zhenjing Sect, which had moved over from Yu Gui Sect, had recently swallowed up Shujian Lake in one fell swoop and was now quite prosperous. However, Jiang Shangzhen was quite adept at playing the game, willing to bend down to be accommodating as the sect leader. Any conflicts with outsiders were invariably the sect's fault, and the ancestral hall would punish the disciples, assisting rival sects with head deliveries multiple times to avoid trouble and hidden dangers. 

The wild cultivator Liu Laocheng from Gongliu Island was in the Jade Purity Realm, and the river-cutting true monarch Liu Zhimiao had also broken through, becoming the second wild cultivator of the upper five realms. Of course, they were now considered true disciples of the Zhenjing Sect. 

The seemingly youthful patriarch of the Wind and Snow Temple had not descended for hundreds of years but had shown himself once during the skirmishes between Zhengyang Mountain and Fenglei Garden. 

A certain female cultivator from Zhenwu Mountain was even more reclusive than the patriarch of the Wind and Snow Temple, but many disciples remained active among the Dali border forces. 

The head of the Jiang family, hidden behind layers of curtains, was just a shadow. 

The first upper five realms deity in Baoping Continent's history was Wei Bo from Cloudy Peak. 

The upper five realms sword cultivator from the Zhuying Dynasty had yet to reveal himself; it was uncertain whether he had died in seclusion or chosen to remain hidden. 

As for that storyteller from the Sui Dynasty, he was now imprisoned on Cloudy Peak, guarding a Gao clan prince. Ma Kuxuan did not look down on this old fellow; aside from being in the Jade Purity Realm, what else was left? 

Finally, Ma Kuxuan recalled that mud-legged fellow from Niping Alley. 

With his eyes opened on horseback, Ma Kuxuan intertwined his fingers and gently pressed down, feeling somewhat amused. Having left the small town, it seemed that all his peers were useless; only this fellow from his hometown piqued his interest as a true rival. 

He didn’t know if he would need to give it his all in their next encounter. 

Most likely, he still wouldn’t need to. 

This was becoming somewhat dull. 

Ma Kuxuan closed his eyes again, starting to think about the proud sons of the Central Plains. 

As for the maid behind him, one day, she would sadly realize that unknowingly, her desire for revenge would vanish. Instead, she would one day genuinely feel that being by Ma Kuxuan’s side was the only safety in the world. 

At that moment, it would be her time to die. 

Ma Kuxuan would leave behind a part of her soul and memories, using some long-lost secret techniques that even the patriarch of Zhenwu Mountain could not grasp to trace her reincarnation. When the time was right, he would return her memories, ensuring that she would be reborn repeatedly, suffering life after life. 

As for Chen Ping’an, as long as he dared to seek revenge, he would only suffer more. 

But before Chen Ping’an sought revenge, Ma Kuxuan would not do much, for it was indeed the Ma family that had been at fault first. 

No matter how ruthless Ma Kuxuan was, he would not indiscriminately kill unrelated people. However, there were many who sought death; if they happened to provoke Ma Kuxuan, he would simply assist them on their way. 

At the summit of Luopo Mountain, early in the morning, Pei Qian had prepared a variety of belongings, as she was about to embark on a long journey! 

Yesterday, that old man told her, “Pack your small bamboo box and bring your walking stick. We’re going to your hometown to study together. Don’t worry; just think of it as accompanying this old man for a leisurely stroll and practicing martial arts later.” 

Pei Qian had just yelled, “Did Old Cui eat enough today?” and then pushed open the bamboo door on the second floor, determined to have another round of beatings. 

After all, if she didn’t throw out a couple of heroic remarks, she would still get hit, so it was better to take some small advantages and act as if she had earned a few copper coins for nothing. 

Unexpectedly, the old man, dressed in green, came out with such a sentence.

Pei Qian felt a bit uneasy but quickly replied, “The old chef has left, but there are still the warm tree girl and others to take care of us. Besides, I didn’t take your bowl at the dining table, did I?” 

Cui Cheng almost couldn’t hold back and wanted to give this girl another solid punch. 

Recently, Cui Cheng had been making frequent appearances and even joined them at the dining table. 

He simply said, “Go downstairs and cool off.” 

But Pei Qian rolled her eyes and lingered for a while, then boldly walked out of the bamboo loft, standing in the corridor with her hands on her hips, shouting, “Zhou Mili!” 

The black-clad girl sitting on the stairs on the first floor immediately ran over and asked, “Why didn’t I hear any shouting today?” 

Pei Qian raised an eyebrow, crossed her arms, and sneered, “What do you think? Once I entered the second floor, without a clear winner, do you think I could walk out?” 

Zhou Mili furrowed her brow, deep in thought, before finally asking, “Did we put something in that bowl of rice? Why didn’t I know about this beforehand? Isn’t this something for Warm Tree to handle? I’m the right guardian of Luopo Mountain; it should be my job…” 

Pei Qian jumped down from the second floor and floated to Zhou Mili’s side. In a flash, she reached out and pressed the head of this clueless little fool, twisting her wrist, causing Zhou Mili to spin in place.

Eventually, Zhou Mili found it amusing and began running in circles. 

Pei Qian extended her fingers, lightly commanding, “Freeze!” 

Zhou Mili immediately stopped, wide-eyed and motionless. 

Pei Qian raised her fingers in front of her, positioning her other hand in a posture of gathering energy, nodding, “This technique of mine is truly remarkable; not even the water monster from Dumb Lake can escape.” 

Zhou Mili remained still, her eyes shining brightly. 

Pei Qian felt quite satisfied, tossing her fingers at her, “Move!” 

Zhou Mili quickly clapped her hands, excitedly exclaiming, “Amazing, amazing! Just now, I really couldn’t move!” 

Today, Pei Qian took Zhou Mili to find Chen Ruchu to play. The three girls gathered together, chattering like countless peach blossoms blooming in the mountains, with yellow orioles perched among them. 

And just like that, the day passed in a blur. 

This morning, not only did Chen Ruchu and Zhou Mili arrive, but Zheng Dafeng also came, along with Chen Lingjun. 

Zheng Dafeng’s expression remained impassive. 

It was no wonder—he really couldn’t stop it. 

Chen Lingjun glanced at the old man Cui Cheng but then looked away, walking toward the cliff to daze alone. 

Cui Cheng said to Zheng Dafeng, “Tell Zhu Lian not to take that half of martial luck; that’s quite good.” 

Zheng Dafeng, holding a paulownia leaf umbrella, grinned, “If the old chef doesn’t want it, I’ll take it.” 

Cui Cheng kicked him lightly, displeased, but Zheng Dafeng easily dodged. 

Pei Qian showed off the sword and knife she hadn’t used in a long time, both bamboo sword and bamboo knife in hand. 

She also carried a walking stick and had her small bamboo box on her back. 

Today, the old man was also dressed in a scholar’s robe. 

Pei Qian had seen the old man in this outfit before but found it particularly strange today. 

Cui Cheng chuckled, “You don’t know, but I also come from a scholarly background. My knowledge was quite impressive in my youth, making me one of the notable scholars in Baoping Continent.” 

Pei Qian replied, “Did you count that yourself?” 

Cui Cheng smirked, “Oh?” 

Pei Qian immediately exclaimed, “It shouldn’t be! It’s definitely a widely acknowledged fact in Baoping Continent, both up and down the mountain.” 

Zheng Dafeng sighed inwardly, “The location is set; according to the elder’s instructions, we’ll start from the farthest wilderness in the southwestern region of Nanyuan Kingdom.” 

Cui Cheng nodded, turning to Pei Qian, “Are you prepared?” 

Pei Qian vigorously nodded, tightly gripping her walking stick, tremblingly saying, “Somewhat prepared!” 

Finally, the old man and the young girl seemed to ride the clouds, landing on a rarely visited mountain peak. 

Pei Qian’s complexion turned slightly pale. 

Cui Cheng chuckled softly, “Once we finish this journey, you won’t be so afraid anymore. Trust me.” 

Pei Qian jabbed her walking stick heavily into the ground, scoffing, “What’s there to be afraid of?” 

Cui Cheng gazed into the distance, saying, “Then please put away the talismans from your sleeves.” 

Pei Qian lightly shook one sleeve, pretending she hadn’t heard anything. 

The two of them walked down the mountain together. 

Initially, Pei Qian felt a bit anxious, but as she became accustomed to the mountain path, she soon realized there was really nothing to fear, at least for now. 

They were still quite far from the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom; currently, they were merely traversing the wild lands of the past. 

That evening, Pei Qian skillfully prepared a small pot of fish soup and rice. 

At the foot of the mountain, there was a river. Pei Qian carved a bamboo pole, tied fishing line and hooks, and then cast her rod into the water, quietly squatting by the riverbank. 

The fish bit the hook completely; with a sudden pull, she brought it ashore. 

Cui Cheng looked at the thick fishing pole and felt a headache; this couldn’t be called fishing; it was more like pulling fish. 

However, as he held the large bowl of fish soup, the old man, sitting cross-legged, didn’t bother with such trivialities. It was not like he was Chen Ping’an. 

If Chen Ping’an ever dared to mention such trivial matters, the old man might find himself unable to hold back from scolding him a few times. What’s so great about being a master? Always meddling in everything, while Pei Qian’s temperament is still so small… 

Just thinking about this made the old man feel a bit self-deprecating. He gently said to Pei Qian, “Eat slowly; no one is competing with you.” 

Pei Qian responded with an “Oh,” and began to chew slowly. 

After cleaning up the bowls and pots used for cooking, Pei Qian took out her water bottle and washed her hands. Then, from the small bamboo box, where she had neatly organized various items, she took out writing materials and began to carefully copy books, using the small bamboo box as a writing desk. 

Cui Cheng sat beside her, chuckling, “Now that we’re here, you don’t need to copy books. If your master gets angry later, just say I gave you permission.” 

Pei Qian diligently copied a complete sentence before turning her head to glare, “What are you talking about?” 

Cui Cheng waved his hand. 

After Pei Qian finished copying, the sky darkened, and she carefully put away all her belongings. 

In fact, seeing in the dark was as easy as drinking water and eating for the current Pei Qian. 

Noticing that Cui Cheng was dozing off, Pei Qian took her walking stick and stealthily went to the distant mountaintop to practice that crazy sword technique. 

Cui Cheng asked with a smile, “Since it’s swordsmanship, why not use the bamboo sword at your waist?” 

Pei Qian paused her movements and replied loudly, “To learn from my master, of course! My master wouldn’t easily draw his sword; you don’t understand. Well, I don’t quite understand either, but I just follow along.” 

Cui Cheng asked, “What if your master is wrong?” 

Pei Qian continued practicing the crazy sword technique, the wind whistling around her, causing her words to sound somewhat fragmented to ordinary martial artists. Fortunately, Cui Cheng could hear her clearly, “My master is here with me. How could he possibly teach wrong? He won’t be wrong in this lifetime, and if he is, I won’t consider it wrong either. No one can meddle with that.” 

Cui Cheng chuckled, no longer speaking, and closed his eyes to rest. 

Around midnight, Cui Cheng woke Pei Qian. She rubbed her eyes but didn’t complain. 

Traveling day and night, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, what was there to be surprised about? 

When they descended the mountain, Pei Qian had an awkward fishing rod slung over her shoulder. 

Cui Cheng asked, “Aren’t you tired?” 

Pei Qian seemed to have been waiting for this question, looking pitiful as she said, “I’m tired.” 

Cui Cheng replied, “Don’t think I’ll help you carry the fishing rod; I can’t afford to lose face.” 

Pei Qian sighed, asking Cui Cheng to wait a moment while she took off the fishing line, putting it back into a small bag in her bamboo box. After re-adjusting her box, she grasped the fishing rod and shouted, “Let’s go!” 

The fishing rod shot straight into a nearby large tree. 

The following day, for both lunch and dinner, they continued to eat fish soup and rice as they traveled along the river. 

Cui Cheng sipped his soup, saying, “If we keep going along the river, will we be eating this every day?” 

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “As long as there’s something to eat, be content; what more do you want?” 

Pei Qian finally huffed, “You don’t know. Back when I traveled the rivers with my master, there were only the two of us. The old chef had nothing to do with it. That was the real hardship. At that time, my master was testing me, not yet formally accepting me as his first disciple. My master was incredible at fishing, but I wasn’t. Once, I was so hungry, and my master didn’t call me over to eat. You guess what I did?” 

Cui Cheng laughed, “Did you beg Chen Ping’an for a bite to eat?” 

Pei Qian scoffed, “Nonsense! I went into a murky river, not too deep, about waist-high. I dove in, stretched out my arms, and rummaged in the cracks of the rocks. With a bit of stirring, I caught a big fish, nearly as long as my arm—a fierce catfish that wouldn’t let go once it bit! I quickly surfaced and ran ashore, shaking my arm vigorously several times before smashing that big catfish to the ground!” 

As she spoke, Pei Qian felt a bit proud, “My master was dumbfounded, giving me a thumbs up and praising me endlessly!” 

Cui Cheng chuckled, “That’s a tall tale.” 

Pei Qian relaxed her shoulders, “Alright, my master indeed didn’t give me a thumbs up or say anything nice; he just glanced at me.” 

In truth, that time, the black-haired girl had stubbornly hidden her injured arm behind her back, glaring at Chen Ping’an with her eyes. 

At this moment, Pei Qian quickly vowed to the old man, “That big catfish, I really caught it…” 

As she said this, worried that Cui Cheng might not believe her, she rolled up her sleeve only to find her scars had long faded. 

Pei Qian soon wore a bright smile, “Fortunately, that day my master casually grabbed some herbs and threw them at me, crushing them to apply on my arm; it didn’t hurt at all. Isn’t that amazing? You wouldn’t understand!” 

Cui Cheng nodded with a smile. 

After that, 

Pei Qian continued to copy books daily and practice that crazy sword technique from time to time. 

Cui Cheng simply led Pei Qian along at a leisurely pace. 

This day, watching Pei Qian skipping stones on the water, the old man casually asked, “Pei Qian, what’s the saddest thing you’ve heard in your life?” 

Pei Qian pretended not to hear. 

The old man asked again. 

Pei Qian squatted by the water's edge, slowly saying, “Just twice. Once was in a guesthouse on the border of the Daqin Dynasty in Tongyezhou. My master didn’t actually say anything, but just looked at me, and I felt sad.” 

“The other time was when that big goose asked me if I could only practice martial arts once my master dies. That was also sad; it kept me awake at night.” 

Cui Cheng didn’t say anything further. 

It seemed that Pei Qian, who quickly became carefree, had picked two nameless grasses from the riverbank, playing the game of grass-fighting, a favorite pastime of rural children. 

The mountains and rivers stretched far, gradually leading them to a place with signs of human habitation. 

Cui Cheng still guided Pei Qian through the beautiful landscapes, and at a steep cliff, he stood with his hands clasped behind him, smiling, “What a beautiful iron flower embroidered cliff, killing intent silencing the frogs.” 

Pei Qian nodded gently, as if she understood completely. 

Cui Cheng turned and smiled, “Accustomed to walking on two feet through the mountains, shall we have a real mountain-hopping adventure next? Are you up for it?” 

Pei Qian placed a talisman on her forehead, boldly declaring, “In the world of rivers and lakes, there’s no such word as fear!” 

Cui Cheng didn’t soar away but instead scaled the wall, with Pei Qian following closely behind him. 

Upon reaching the mountain peak, they were at least several miles away from the distant green mountains. 

Cui Cheng smiled, “Hold onto your walking stick and bamboo box tightly.” 

Before Pei Qian could ask anything, the old man suddenly grabbed her shoulder, loudly shouting, “Let’s go!” 

It was as if the mountain god was riding the clouds and mists. Pei Qian felt her legs turn cold at first but quickly adapted, exclaiming, “Wow!” as she began to paddle like a dog, looking down at the rivers and mountains winding beneath her. 

There was nothing to fear. 

Just as they were about to crash into the opposite green mountain, Pei Qian gently adjusted her breathing, stretching her body in mid-air, altering her posture slightly, and landed on a towering tree. 

Her knees bent instantly, and she curled up, causing the tree to snap beneath her. As the broken tree smashed to the ground, Pei Qian lightly touched the ground with her toes, floating down lightly. Cui Cheng already stood beside her, saying, “Let’s see who reaches the top first.” 

Pei Qian dashed off like a streak of green smoke, while Cui Cheng maintained a distance of five or six yards behind her, watching but unable to catch up. 

The two of them moved in a straight line along the mountain path, and when they reached a place where there was no road ahead, Cui Cheng threw Pei Qian into the air. 

In the end, Pei Qian could even practice that crazy sword technique amidst the clouds and mist. 

As night fell, they landed at the foot of a famous mountain in the western region of Nanyuan Kingdom. 

Pei Qian blinked her eyes, eagerly asking, “Are you going to throw me up there?” 

Cui Cheng chuckled, “It’s time to walk. For scholarly people, we should respect the mountains.” 

Pei Qian nodded, “That’s right.” 

The mountainous regions of Nanyuan Kingdom, throughout history, naturally lacked true divine events, though legends might not be scarce in the wild tales of the past. 

However, it was hard to say what was true now. 

Cui Cheng brought Pei Qian up the mountain, walking along the steps. Pei Qian playfully tapped the steps with her walking stick, laughing, “These stairs resemble those back in Luopo Mountain.” 

Cui Cheng responded, “Scenic views around the world often look alike if not viewed closely.” 

Pei Qian nodded, deciding to silently remember this, so she could later brag about it to that little fool Zhou Mili. 

Cui Cheng gradually ascended the mountain, looking around, reciting a couplet, “A thousand mountains rise like scales, ten thousand valleys echo with pine waves, strange events astonish the aged.” 

Pei Qian nodded, “What a good couplet!” 

Cui Cheng chuckled, “Do you understand?” 

Pei Qian grinned, “I’m just repeating what my master said.” 

Cui Cheng laughed heartily. 

Upon reaching the mountain peak, they found a tightly closed temple door. Cui Cheng did not knock but merely took Pei Qian around to look at some inscriptions and cliff carvings. Gazing into the distance, he sighed, “The ancients once said, a person’s fate lies in their vitality, a nation’s fate lies in its people’s hearts—how true that is, how true.” 

Pei Qian turned to look at him, finally recalling that the old man had said he came from a scholarly background. 

The two of them rarely walked down the mountain together, but as they continued downward, they encountered the smoke of rural fires, bustling towns, and official roads. 

Along the way, they saw many people from all walks of life, mostly passing by without incident. 

That day, the two of them stopped at a roadside tea stall, where Pei Qian paid for two large bowls of cold tea. 

Pei Qian fashioned herself a bamboo hat. 

With swords and knives at her waist, a small bamboo box on her back, and the walking stick leaning against the table, she looked quite comical. 

A group of martial heroes dismounting nearby caught Pei Qian a bit off-guard. Originally sitting across from the old man, she quietly moved to sit beside him on the bench. 

Glancing quickly at those genuine martial artists, Pei Qian lowered her voice and asked the old man, “Do you know what essentials one must have to walk the rivers and lakes?” 

Cui Cheng smiled, “Let’s hear it.” 

Pei Qian whispered, “A large pouch of golden leaves, a fine steed, a blade that can cut through iron like mud, and a resounding nickname in the martial world. My master said that once you have these, you can travel the rivers and lakes and be well-regarded.” 

Pei Qian suddenly became cheerful, “I don’t need a fine steed in the future; my master promised that when I walk the rivers and lakes, he’ll buy me a little donkey!” 

Cui Cheng nodded with a smile. 

The group of martial artists sat nearby, and one of them didn’t immediately take a seat. He reached out and pressed down on the hat of the little girl, laughing heartily, “Where did this little black coal come from? Oh, a little heroine! Carrying blades and swords, how impressive!” 

He heavily pressed down on Pei Qian’s head, asking, “Tell me, who did you learn from?” 

Cui Cheng simply sipped his tea. 

Pei Qian’s face turned pale, and she fell silent, slowly raising her head to timidly respond, “I learned from my master.” 

That martial artist laughed as he stepped back, kicking Pei Qian’s bamboo box with force, “How can one walk the rivers and lakes while carrying a broken book box?” 

Pei Qian was just about to call for help from Cui Cheng when he smiled and said, “Solve it yourself.” 

Pei Qian wiped the sweat from her face. Seeing that he was about to increase his force against her bamboo box, she stood up, stepping aside, and instinctively grabbed her walking stick. 

The man stepped on air, feeling humiliated and angry. Upon witnessing the little black coal skillfully retrieve her weapon, he started to sweat, forcing a friendly demeanor as he bowed and smiled, “I mistook you for someone else, I mistook you for someone else.” 

Pei Qian thought for a moment and returned to her seat. 

Cui Cheng asked with a smile, “Were you afraid to fight back?” 

Pei Qian shook her head, feeling somewhat downcast, “At first, I was worried he’d break my bamboo box. After seeing that his foot was coming, I was even more afraid that if I wasn’t careful, I might punch through his chest.” 

Cui Cheng asked, “Why be afraid of that? Shouldn’t he be afraid of you?” 

Pei Qian still shook her head, “My master once said, walking the rivers and lakes is not just about seeking vengeance and killing. When it comes to small matters, the ability to hold back your fists is the true skill of a martial artist.” 

Cui Cheng laughed. 

He wasn’t sure if he was laughing at the little girl’s grandiose claims or the local saying about “doorway.” 

Cui Cheng finished his tea and said, “With only a few coins worth of belongings, losing a copper coin would naturally be distressing; if you had a pile of divine money and lost a few coins…” 

Pei Qian replied firmly, “I would still search everywhere for it!” 

What a joke; how could one lose money and not seek it back? 

Her master had said that every copper coin in her purse was a little pitiful creature without a home if lost. 

Seeing the old man silent, Pei Qian curiously asked, “If you put it another way, I would listen.” 

Cui Cheng laughed, “It’s just that the old man has finished saying all he can; there’s nothing left to say.” 

Pei Qian felt a little disappointed, “Think of another?” 

Cui Cheng shook his head, “No more thoughts.” 

The group at the neighboring table finished their tea and mounted their horses, riding away. 

Apparently, they were truly in a hurry. 

Cui Cheng took Pei Qian to continue their journey. Looking into the distance, he smiled, “Catch up with them and say something heartfelt; anything will do.” 

Pei Qian hesitated. 

Cui Cheng waved his hand. 

Pei Qian took a deep breath, adjusted her hat, and began to sprint, carefully considering what to say to make it sound reasonable and respectful. Moments later, the earnest Pei Qian sprinted past the horseman. 

Gradually slowing, she looked up at the melancholy horseman, saying, “In the world of rivers and lakes, one must speak of righteousness!” 

Seeing the man’s dazed expression, Pei Qian emphasized, “Do you remember?” 

The man trembled and responded, “I remember!” 

Not only him, but even the other martial friends couldn’t help but echo her words. 

With their responses, Pei Qian abruptly stopped, waiting for the old man behind her to catch up. 

Afterward, Pei Qian and Cui Cheng walked over the tall walls of the state city. 

Having burned incense at various temples and visited marketplaces for various delicacies, Pei Qian even bought books for her Baoping elder sister and Li Huai. Naturally, the friends on Luopo Mountain also prepared gifts from their own pockets. However, in this hometown of Nanyuan Kingdom, divine money was useless. Watching copper coins and silver grains, it felt as if they had entered someone else’s doorstep, leaving Pei Qian feeling somewhat disheartened. 

As Cui Cheng and Pei Qian exited the bookstore, he asked, “Following your master’s way of living, do you ever feel it’s boring?” 

Pei Qian strode confidently down the bustling street, “Of course not! What’s so boring about living? As long as I can eat and drink enough every day, what more could I want? In the past, I was a beggar in the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom, dressed in rags, unable to even enter a door. How pitiful it was; I could only huddle by the wall, trying to get close enough to pray to the gods and Buddha. But even they couldn’t hear me, and I still ended up hungry and beaten.” 

Cui Cheng smiled, “But didn’t the gods eventually hear you? They brought Chen Ping’an right before you and made him your master?” 

Pei Qian suddenly stopped, her eyes turning red as she let the old man wait. She ran to the temple in the city, offered incense, and not only that, but she also took out her bamboo box and placed it aside, prostrating multiple times on the mat beneath the goddess’s feet. 

After leaving the city, Cui Cheng said it was time to head to the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom. 

Pei Qian nodded without saying a word. 

By a river not far from the capital, 

Cui Cheng sat by the water while Pei Qian squatted beside him, splashing water on her face. 

The old man asked, “Are you still afraid of Cao Qinglang? If you are, we can enter the city later.” 

Pei Qian remained silent, gazing blankly at the opposite bank. 

The old man casually picked up a stone and lightly tossed it into the river, smiling, “It’s fine to fear someone or something, but you shouldn’t let that fear prevent you from facing them. Scholars study, and many say the same things over and over, but can ordinary successors catch up? Does that mean they should stop studying? Some ancient writers wrote poems and verses, and what can later generations do but stare? Does that mean they should stop writing? The worst part is, once you’re on a path, it’s destined to be difficult to turn back. You can’t deceive yourself, only doing what’s easy within your reach.” 

He pointed to the distance, “But you must know what the situation is like over there; keep your eyes wide open and observe carefully. You can’t hide away; otherwise, you’ll be afraid for a lifetime.” 

The old man smiled, “It’s not just me, an outsider, offering empty words.” 

He continued, “In my student years and later in scholarly pursuits, my heart was high, and I never lost a debate. Later, with my fists alone, traveling thousands of miles was the same. What I seek, whether in study or martial arts, is that saying, ‘Though millions oppose me, I will proceed.’” 

He sighed, “In times without heroes, a young man rises to prominence. This saying is tragic, not because a young man rises, but because there are no heroes. So let’s not be afraid of how good others are; others may be great, but we can be better—that is true growth.” 

“You, Pei Qian, will one day not just be the first disciple of Chen Ping’an; you will simply be Pei Qian. Of course, Chen Ping’an will always care for you; that’s just who he is. He may care less in the future, but those close to you, whom he has gathered around him, will be the burdens he must shoulder for a lifetime. He’s not afraid of hardship; he relishes it. In such matters, advising him to think a little more for himself would be like talking to a duck; he will surely listen but won’t change.” 

The old man fell silent. 

Pei Qian raised her head, “Let’s go to the capital; I’ll lead the way!” 

The two of them entered the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom, following the usual routine—without official documents, they quietly climbed over the walls. 

After all, it was Old Cui leading her; even if her master found out, he probably wouldn’t be too angry, right? 

Upon entering the familiar capital of Nanyuan Kingdom, Pei Qian slowed her pace. 

The old man did not rush her. 

As they passed the Scholar’s Lane, walked by the martial arts hall that was still in operation, and reached the Heart Resonance Temple, Pei Qian quickened her steps. 

However, just as Pei Qian began to feel less afraid, the old man stopped at the temple entrance, where no incense visitors were entering or exiting. 

Pei Qian intended to follow him inside, but Cui Cheng shook his head, saying, “For the last leg of the journey, you should walk alone.” 

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, turning to leave, walking down a main street toward a small alley. 

The old man watched her slender figure with a smile, then walked into the temple, not burning incense, finally finding a quiet corridor to sit. 

In the small alley, Pei Qian noticed the courtyard gate was tightly shut, and she sat on the steps outside. 

She waited until dusk, when a young man in a green robe walked into the alley. 

Pei Qian stood up and looked at him. 

Cao Qinglang quickly approached, smiling. 

Pei Qian slowly spoke, “Long time no see, Cao Qinglang.” 

Cao Qinglang smiled back, “Hello, Pei Qian.” 

As he opened the door, he turned to ask, “Last time you left in a hurry, so you didn’t get to ask how Mr. Chen is…” 

Pei Qian felt a surge of irritation, blurted out, “Why are you such a pain?” 

Cao Qinglang chuckled in surprise. 

He was indeed a bit afraid of her. 

Pei Qian looked at him. 

Cao Qinglang, puzzled, asked, “What’s wrong?” 

Pei Qian strode into the courtyard, picking up a familiar little stool, “Cao Qinglang, I need to talk to you about something!” 

Cao Qinglang sat down with a smile. 

Two small stools, two not-so-young old friends. 

In the corridor of the Heart Resonance Temple, Cui Cheng closed his eyes, remaining silent for a long time, as if waiting for the reunion in the alley, wanting to know the answer before feeling at ease. 

However, Cui Cheng’s expression grew increasingly weary; after Pei Qian left, he could no longer hide his old age. 

During this time, a monk approached, but Cui Cheng merely smiled and shook his head. The monk then smiled, joined his hands together, and turned to leave. 

Cui Cheng remained seated, seemingly having finally let go of his worries. His hands gently overlapped, his gaze distant. After a long silence, he gently closed his eyes and murmured, “There is true meaning in this; what I want to say has already been forgotten.”

 ### Chapter 664: Morning Bells and Evening Drums, No Smoke from the Kitchen

On the desolate peaks, the young mountain lord had gone on a long journey, and the old man from the second floor had also wandered off. The bamboo tower had become uninhabited.

Recently, Chen Lingjun had stopped wandering aimlessly outside and would occasionally come to sit by the stone table at the cliff’s edge. He was well aware that he was the least liked person on the desolate mountain, far less charming than that little fire python from the Cao family’s Zhilian Tower, who was diligent and clever. He was even less endearing than the silly but lovable Zhou Mili.

Cen Yuanji, brought to the mountain by Zhu Lian, had decent talent and was diligent in his training, living a busy and fulfilling life. Shi Rou was managing a shop in a nearby town. While her earnings weren’t substantial, she was still helping the desolate mountain financially and had a good relationship with Pei Qian. Whenever Pei Qian had free time, she would go check on Shi Rou, ostensibly to ensure she wasn’t pocketing money, but in truth, she was worried that Shi Rou felt neglected by the desolate mountain.

Only Chen Lingjun, stubbornly concerned about appearances, was left to suffer. 

That brother of the Water God from the Yujing, after three nights of divine feasting, had grown increasingly polite towards him, but this politeness left Chen Lingjun feeling even more dejected. The flattery was so overbearing that he could hardly adapt to it. He preferred the days back in the Water Mansion, where they drank heartily and ate recklessly, exchanging coarse words and insults.

But Chen Lingjun wasn’t a fool; he could see many things. 

For instance, the departure of the esteemed elder Cui meant that he wouldn’t be coming back after visiting that Lotus Root Blessed Land. Yet, he couldn’t even utter a farewell. When the elderly gentleman in the blue robe took Pei Qian away, he could only sit there in a daze, pretending he knew nothing.

Early in the morning, it should have been time for Pei Qian to ascend the tower and train. Now, however, the bamboo tower was silent.

Chen Lingjun leaned on the table, surrounded by a pile of sunflower seeds he had taken from Chen Ruchu. The warmth of the midday sun left him feeling lethargic, unable even to crack a seed.

He wondered if he should head to the mountain gate and mess around with Brother Dafeng. Brother Dafeng still had a good bit of chivalry left in him, though he often twisted his words so much that it took a long time to figure out what he meant.

Chen Lingjun turned his gaze towards the rows of residences. The old chef was absent from the mountain, and Pei Qian was away. Cen Yuanji couldn’t cook and was too lazy to bother with it, so Chen Ruchu had prepared a heap of pastries for everyone. Zhou Mili was a little water monster who didn’t require much food, so there was no smoke rising from the kitchen. The mountain was filled with layers of peach and plum blossoms, while the smoke of human activity was far away.

Chen Lingjun felt that with fewer people on the desolate mountain, everyone busy with their own affairs, the warmth of human connection had significantly waned.

He shifted his gaze to the second floor of the bamboo tower, feeling a bit melancholic. When the old man was around, he always felt drained, thinking he could never withstand just two punches from him. But now that he was gone, there was a hollow feeling inside.

Chen Lingjun sighed heavily, reaching for a sunflower seed, planning to chew on it unpeeled to pass the time. 

Just then, he became stiff in his movements. He gently put the seed back down, subtly shifted his rear, and prepared to turn his face toward the cliff’s edge as if it were a natural move.

Unexpectedly, the elder in the blue robe appeared out of nowhere, smiling at him.

Chen Lingjun swallowed hard, stood up, and bowed, "Chen Lingjun greets the National Master."

Cui Zhan, the embroidered tiger of the Great Li, was someone who could crush him with just a finger.

With Chen Ping'an absent from the desolate mountain, the old man gone from the bamboo tower, and Zhu Lian and Wei Ban heading to the Central Peak region, Chen Lingjun found himself temporarily without support!

Cui Zhan smiled, "Go about your business."

Chen Lingjun glanced at the stone path leading from the bamboo tower to the residences, feeling a bit uneasy. He took his leave and descended the stone cliff, choosing to stay farther from the National Master for a sense of security.

Cui Zhan recalled the little green snake in blue who had looked toward the bamboo tower earlier and smiled to himself.

After a bit of consideration, he casually acted without making a fuss.

To the west of Longquan County, there was a mountain peak temporarily occupied, seemingly suitable for the likes of dragons to reside. 

Standing in the corridor on the second floor, Cui Zhan patiently awaited someone’s arrival.

A white rainbow streaked across the distant sky, its momentum akin to the sound of spring thunder, rushing towards him.

All the rules set by Ruan Qiong were disregarded.

Cui Zhan shook his head, sighing inwardly, thankful that he had at least greeted Ruan Qiong.

A white-clad young man with a mole on his forehead arrived, wielding a plain green bamboo staff, looking travel-worn and exhausted.

Cui Dongshan landed in the open space on the first floor, his eyes bloodshot, and angrily exclaimed, "You old bastard! Do you just eat shit every day? Why didn’t you stop Grandpa from going to that blessed land?!"

Cui Zhan countered, "And if I had stopped him, what then?"

Cui Dongshan's face turned iron gray with rage. "If I could stop him for a day, that would be a day! Can’t you wait for me to arrive?! And then get as far away from me as you can!"

Cui Zhan remained indifferent.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan calmed down, taking a deep breath. "Grandpa has always been diligent in studying, practicing martial arts, and dealing with people. The only time he stepped back was for us two foolish grandsons! And with this retreat, everything is ruined—his eleventh-level martial arts realm, gone! Without the eleventh level, he’s gonna die!"

Cui Zhan remarked, "And for your teacher, and for this desolate mountain."

Cui Dongshan retreated step by step, finally sitting down next to a stone table, resting his hands on the bamboo staff, lowering his head in frustration.

Perhaps unable to sit still, he stood up, pacing anxiously.

Cui Zhan watched the flustered young man and slowly said, "You don’t even understand what Grandpa truly cares about and why he chose to make sacrifices. What’s the point of coming here? Is it interesting? If you go to the Lotus Root Blessed Land and find Grandpa, what good will it do? It might even just make him uneasy."

Cui Dongshan stopped in his tracks, glaring fiercely, "Cui Zhan! Watch your words!"

Cui Zhan replied, "Cui Dongshan, you should be more discerning and sensible. It’s not like you’ve just re-entered the upper fifth realm, so you can bounce around here with impunity."

Cui Dongshan sat down gently, hugging his bamboo staff, not looking at the second floor anymore, muttering to himself, "Why did Grandpa have to intervene in that dispute? Why did he lose his mind? Wasn’t it our fault? Grandpa is a scholar; he has always hoped that we would be true scholars. His lifelong studies and knowledge come from the line of the Lesser Sage. Why would he act out for us, the line of the Cultural Sage, in the Middle Earth? Why did we betray our teacher and destroy our ancestry, causing Grandpa even more disappointment?"

Cui Zhan slammed his palm on the railing, finally losing his temper, "Ask me?! Ask the heavens, ask your conscience!"

Cui Dongshan looked dazed, gripping his hiking staff tightly. "I’m just tired. I can’t think anymore."

He remembered when he was young, that stern and rigid elder took him to visit mountains and climb high, a long and arduous journey that made the child suffer greatly. 

One time, the elder ascended the steps, ignoring the child covered in sweat behind him, continuing his ascent. 

It seemed the elder was purposely trying to provoke his grandson, walking far ahead while loudly reciting poetry from a literary giant of the Middle Earth, saying that a man’s righteous spirit matched that of a king, lamenting how he wished he had a giant pen like a long staff!

The child memorized that poem word for word, but later, he never expected that as he grew up, the young man in a fit of pique would leave home and become a disciple of an old scholar. The old scholar unwittingly became a Cultural Sage, and the young man inexplicably became the first disciple of the Sage, eventually having a chance to meet that renowned Confucian sage of the Middle Earth. Yet, by that time, the spirited young man, in comparison to his peers, only had one thought in mind: to return home one day and tell his grandfather that the person he admired in literary prowess lost to his grandson, and in chess, lost so badly that he had to break his beard.

But in this life, he had accumulated so many words that when he could speak, he refused to, and when he wished to speak, he found he could no longer do so.

In the distance, the sound of morning bells echoed from Longquan County, faintly reaching their ears.

As the bell rang, it signaled the opening of the city gates, and the common folk began their labor. Only when the evening drums ceased would families gather, enjoying a warm reunion.

Yuchun County, near the foot of the new Central Peak in the Great Li, was a medium-sized county. It wasn’t particularly prosperous in the old Zhu Ying dynasty, both in literary and martial pursuits; the cultural level was average, and it had failed to benefit from the majesty of the great peaks nearby. The new governor Wu Yuan was an outsider, said to have been a county magistrate in the Great Li, which was essentially a demotion. However, the clever folks in the officialdom knew that Governor Wu was undoubtedly sent into exile. Once he was far from the court's sight, it meant losing the chance to quickly ascend to the heart of the Great Li’s hierarchy. Being dispatched to a vassal state without promotion meant he was clearly an unappreciated person, likely due to offending someone.

However, despite his dim prospects, Wu County Magistrate was still from the Great Li and quite young, so the Liangzhou Inspector, who oversaw Yuchun County, had privately instructed the officials there to treat Wu Yuan with respect. Even if there were some actions that didn’t align with local customs, they had to endure it a bit. Fortunately, after Wu Yuan took office, he hardly made any moves. He only showed up for roll call and left most matters to the old hands in the yamen. Many opportunities to publicly handle affairs were given to several senior advisors in the yamen, creating a harmonious atmosphere overall. However, such a soft approach inevitably led subordinates to feel disdain.

That day, the young governor sat idly in the yamen as usual, his desk piled high with local chronicles and geographical maps, slowly flipping through them and occasionally jotting down notes.

Wu Yuan suddenly felt a sense of awareness, looking up to see a familiar face leaning against the yamen's door. His mood lifted, he smiled, stood up, and bowed, "Mountain Lord has arrived; I apologize for not welcoming you."

It was Wei Ban, who had removed his disguise.

Wei Ban stepped over the threshold, laughing, "Governor Wu is a bit lacking in loyalty, huh? You only sent me a congratulatory letter for that night excursion banquet."

Wu Yuan laughed openly, "My salary is meager; I can only manage to support myself with about ten percent of it, spend about fifty to sixty percent on books, and save what little silver is left, all because I have my eye on an ancient inkstone from the neighboring Yunxing County. I truly thought that with the long journey ahead, it wouldn’t be proper for the Mountain Lord to come all the way here to settle scores. I never expected you to be so persistent, actually coming!"

Wei Ban twirled his wrist, producing a renowned old sink stone inkstone from the old Zhu Ying dynasty, placing it gently on the desk. "Governor Wu lacks loyalty, but I, Wei Ban, am different. I traveled a thousand miles to catch up and didn’t forget to go out of my way to buy a gift."

Wu Yuan leaned down to examine the adorable ancient inkstone, tracing its texture with his fingers, and exclaimed, "Good heavens! This comes from the first-class inkstone quarry of the Green Dragon Pit beneath the waters! The key is that the martial general stationed in our Great Li has already sealed off this old quarry, dispatching soldiers to guard it. Clearly, it will soon become a tribute to our Emperor. Thus, the few ancient inkstones on the market are becoming increasingly exorbitant. I doubt I could save enough silver to buy one even in a hundred years as a magistrate!"

Wu Yuan reluctantly pulled his gaze away and looked at the white-clad deity, smiling as he asked, "Mountain Lord, just speak your mind. With this precious inkstone as a guarantee, I assure you I will speak honestly and openly."

Wei Ban replied, "How is the Mountain Lord Jin Qing of the Central Peak?"

The new Central Peak mountain lord, Jin Qing, had once been the chief mountain deity of the Zhu Ying dynasty. There was a unique sword-washing pool halfway up the mountain, where many sword cultivators would come to temper their blades, and Jin Qing often secretly protected their paths, establishing excellent relationships not only with the numerous sword cultivators from the Zhu Ying dynasty but also with many Golden Core sword cultivators across the continent. Jin Qing had a particularly close bond with Li Tuanjing of the Wind and Thunder Garden. 

Li Tuanjing had traveled to the Zhu Ying dynasty in his youth and had many conflicts that angered a deity of the Northern Peak. In a perilous moment, Jin Qing had even risked offending his colleagues, the Southern and Northern Mountain Lords, to ensure the safety of Li Tuanjing, who had only just reached the Dragon Gate realm at that time.

Wu Yuan chuckled heartily, turning to pull out a stack of papers from his desk, neatly inscribed in fine script, and handed them to Wei Ban. "It’s all written down."

Wei Ban lowered his head to peruse the contents on the paper, clicking his tongue. "Along the way, the local villagers have all said that Yuchun County has a governor who is never seen. I see now that Governor Wu hasn’t been idle."

The haphazard rumors gathered from hearsay held little significance and could easily mislead. However, what Wu Yuan had written down detailed the real actions taken by the Central Peak and Jin Qing throughout history.

As Wei Ban carefully read through the stack of papers, noting the specific actions Jin Qing had taken in different dynasties and years, there were also comments in red ink, detailing Wu Yuan’s observations like a historian. Some local legends and tales were mentioned as well, each circled with the terms "divine" and "strange" noted at the end.

Wei Ban read through the papers quickly, soon finishing the large stack and returning it to Wu Yuan, smiling, "It seems the gift was not given in vain."

Wei Ban stood on tiptoe, glancing at the stack of papers on the desk. "Oh, coincidentally, Governor Wu has recently been studying the origins of the various inkstone quarries in Yunxing County? What, planning to publish a book or something? Isn’t it a bit inappropriate for the magistrate of Yuchun County to secretly profit from the specialties of Yunxing County?"

Wu Yuan confessed, "With nothing to do, I thought I’d use this small matter as a starting point to glean some insights into the changes in the Zhu Ying dynasty's officialdom. The archives of the fallen royal palace are sealed, and I’ve had no opportunity to browse through them, so I had no choice but to seek a different path."

Wei Ban nodded, praising, "Governor Wu hasn’t acted as if he’s the new inspector of Longzhou. It’s quite regretful."

Wu Yuan smiled, "Rewards and punishments should be like this. Being able to keep my position as magistrate is already quite satisfying. I can avoid drawing the ire of certain big shots in the court and not obstruct the paths of others—it's a blessing in disguise, so to speak. Hiding here, I can enjoy some peace."

Wei Ban had no intention of lingering. Wu Yuan remarked, "You must be on your way to visit Xu Ruo, right? It’s best to visit the Central Peak shrine first and then catch up with old friends without delay."

Wei Ban nodded, "That’s the plan. Earlier, I was in seclusion at the Cloud-Peeking Mountain, and Xu helped guard the entrance. Just as I was about to succeed in my seclusion, he quietly left and returned to your Central Peak. Such a generous gesture, I couldn’t let it go without a face-to-face thank you."

Wu Yuan smiled, "Then please hurry along, don’t delay my enjoyment of this ancient inkstone."

Wei Ban laughed as he left, his figure fading away.

In fact, after Wei Ban left the ferry and appeared in Yunxing County, the towering statue in the shrine atop the Central Peak opened its golden eyes. Yet, Jin Qing, the mountain lord, chose to ignore the visit of the white-clad deity.

As soon as Wei Ban arrived at the foot of the mountain in Yuchun County, Jin Qing stepped out from the golden statue, appearing as a tall, sturdy man clad in purple robes and jade belt, with the mountain’s incense thriving, yet no one could witness this scene.

Jin Qing walked past the many good men and women devoutly worshiping within the grand hall. After stepping over the threshold, he took a step forward, directly arriving at the relatively quiet peak of the Central Peak.

The world’s various mountains were seldom solitary; they were often part of extensive ranges. The Central Peak consisted of eight peaks, with its main peak revered as the sovereign of the mountains in the central territory of the Zhu Ying dynasty. At the summit stood the Central Peak Shrine, a place for offerings by emperors and subjects throughout the ages.

The second peak was named Diezhang Peak, which had no temple or Daoist shrine. It was Jin Qing's earliest mountain deity hall, now managed only by a few mountain deity maidens, with no mountain deity residing there.

When the structure was first established, Jin Qing was not yet the Central Peak lord. The old mountain deity's golden body had crumbled, and authority over the mountain was conferred to Jin Qing. At that time, the prime minister of the Zhu Ying dynasty had built a hut at Diezhang Peak’s northern slope, where he spent many years studying and practicing martial arts.

Jin Qing’s expression was indifferent as he gazed down at the vast land and rivers.

Everything about human affairs was but a fleeting cloud.

Jin Qing shifted his gaze to the old Junzhang Cave at the Dragon Sealing Peak, where the Moke hero Xu Ruo was waiting alone. Though claiming to be in deep cultivation, the mountain deities of the Central Peak were well aware that Xu Ruo was monitoring the Central Peak's movements. Compared to the intense battles on the new Eastern Peak of Shizhan, where countless cultivators had died, the Central Peak had been relatively bloodless. Jin Qing only knew that Xu Ruo had left the Central Peak territory twice; the last time was to guard Wei Ban at the Cloud-Peeking Mountain, while the first departure was shrouded in mystery. After that, a certain old sword immortal, who was considered the stabilizing force of the Zhu Ying dynasty, had not yet made an appearance, leaving Jin Qing uncertain whether it was Xu Ruo’s interference that prevented that old sword immortal from showing up.

If Xu Ruo truly had stopped that old sword immortal, Jin Qing, as a mountain lord of Baoping Continent, would feel somewhat relieved.

Regarding Xu Ruo’s cultivation level, no one could definitively say, and there was no clear answer. If Ruan Qiong from the Longquan Sword Sect was the most famous upper fifth realm cultivator in Baoping Continent, then Xu Ruo was the one who concealed his strength the best. The only clue was that during the challenge of the Heavenly Monarch Xie Shi at the Windsnow Temple, there were whispers afterward that someone had drawn their sword behind him, and even Wei Jin might not win.

Even if Xu Ruo was cultivating right under Jin Qing's eyes, he appeared as inscrutable as before.

Jin Qing glanced at the Yuchun County magistrate’s yamen, a cold smile appearing on his face.

It was highly likely that this Northern Peak mountain lord had met with Wu Yuan and was on his way to the Dragon Sealing Peak to express his gratitude to Xu Ruo.

Only then would he gather more confidence to seek him out.

Jin Qing furrowed his brow.

In the next moment, a figure in white floated down, appearing at Diezhang Peak and walking slowly toward Jin Qing. That person smiled and said, "I greet Mountain Lord Jin; please forgive my intrusion."

Jin Qing replied, "As a mountain lord and deity, there’s no need for such pleasantries. If you have something to say, please do so; if not, feel free to leave."

Wei Ban nodded, "That’s best. I’ve come to remind you, Jin Qing, don’t be so proud as the Mountain Lord of the Central Peak; our Northern Peak is quite unhappy."

Jin Qing did not look at the graceful figure in white but fixed his gaze on the distant horizon, asking, "And if they are unhappy, what then?"

Wei Ban lightly tapped a golden ring hanging by his ear, smiling, "Then the Central Peak may be sealed off."

Jin Qing turned his head, "Is there an imperial edict from the Great Li emperor? Or do you have a decree from the Ministry of Rites?"

Wei Ban nodded, "Of course…"

Then shook his head, adding, "Neither."

Jin Qing extended a hand, mocking, "Then Mountain Lord Wei can do as you please?"

Wei Ban truly did as he pleased.

The Northern Peak’s aura surged towards the central region of the continent like a mountain and sea, a momentum like the Grand Li cavalry charging from the north to the south.

From the look of it, this was no mere bluff.

Jin Qing knew that once the mountain and water fortunes of the two peaks collided, it would create a tremendous problem, and he could no longer contain his anger, shouting, "Wei Ban! You should weigh the consequences!"

Wei Ban clasped his hands behind his back, smiling brightly, "You should refer to me as Mountain Lord Wei."

Jin Qing no longer wasted words. He saw the giant deity statue of the Central Peak appearing, raising its arms high and sweeping through the clouds, as if to strike Diezhang Peak with a single blow.

Behind Wei Ban, at the peak of Diezhang, there was also a majestic deity statue towering over the mountain. Even though it was not in its own mountain territory, Wei Ban’s statue was still over fifty zhang taller than that of the Central Peak deity.

Using his divine ability, Wei Ban manifested a Northern Peak deity statue, one hand gripping the Central Peak deity's arm while the other pressed down on its head. Then, with a heavy stomp, he pushed the Jin Qing deity statue back, almost toppling it over toward Dragon Sealing Peak, and without restraint, the golden halo behind Wei Ban's giant statue extended back, preparing to smash down on the Central Peak statue's head.

Both sides were somewhat restrained; the statues had turned incorporeal, or else the three peaks of the Central Peak would have been destroyed beyond recognition.

At that moment, from the old Junzhang Cave on Dragon Sealing Peak, a rather unremarkable man stepped out of his hut, holding a sword behind his back in an odd posture. He seemed somewhat helpless, shaking his head, then reached for the sword hilt behind him, gently drawing it out a few inches.

In that instant, a mountain range appeared between the two mountain deity statues.

He advised, "If the two mountain lords truly cannot stand each other, it would be better to choose a civil way to resolve this. Otherwise, rolling up your sleeves to fight would be beneath your dignity and would make the Northern and Gansu mountain lords laugh at us. I, Xu Ruo, might also be accused of neglecting my duty to protect the mountains."

Jin Qing’s face darkened as he withdrew his deity statue.

Wei Ban also retracted his towering deity.

However, the momentum of the Northern Peak’s aura surging southward, colliding with the mountain, did not diminish.

Jin Qing asked, "Wei Ban, I advise you to stop while you’re ahead!"

Wei Ban replied, "Jin Qing, if you continue to act as you have, you will not be able to maintain the peace of your old mountains and rivers. The Great Li court is not foolish; they know you have never truly pledged your allegiance. If you cannot understand this, I might as well help the Great Li replace a mountain lord, as I can see that you truly get on my nerves. Xu Ruo has already been kind enough to intervene once."

Jin Qing turned his gaze northward, where the borders of the two peaks were met with stormy weather.

Jin Qing sighed, "You say, what should the Central Peak do so you will withdraw the Northern Peak’s influence?"

Wei Ban smiled, "If you do not show respect to the Northern Peak, how could you have any loyalty to the Great Li court? Do you think the court is filled with three-year-olds? Must I teach you what to do? Carry hefty gifts, go to Cloud-Peeking Mountain, and apologize; visit in person to make amends!"

Xu Ruo rubbed his forehead and returned to his hut, thinking that he was truly unfortunate to have such friends.

Jin Qing puzzled, "Is it really just that simple?"

Wei Ban countered, "Otherwise? Besides, you’ve already arrived in the Northern Peak territory; how far is it to the Great Li capital? Just lift your feet, and you’ll be there. As long as the Central Peak doesn’t create chaos, the Great Li court isn’t mad enough to open slaughter here. Do you understand that your seemingly ambiguous stance of trying to balance loyalty and righteousness will lead many remnants of the fallen kingdom to hope for their heroic deaths, believing they can awaken you and rise with them? If you truly have such thoughts, then I commend you as a man. But if you don’t want this and wish to bear the blame, why pretend otherwise?"

Jin Qing fell silent, dejected.

Wei Ban remarked, "When you turn back to Cloud-Peeking Mountain, don’t forget the gifts, as the heavier the gift, the heavier the sentiment."

After speaking, Wei Ban left Diezhang Peak and headed to the old Junzhang Cave.

Xu Ruo stood at the entrance, arms crossed, leaning against the door, saying discontentedly, "Mountain Lord Wei, is this how you repay me? You come empty-handed and cause such a fuss?"

Wei Ban stomped his foot, lamenting, "It’s truly a case of unreturned favors!"

Xu Ruo stretched out his hands, rubbing his cheeks vigorously. "To be a mountain lord to this extent is truly rare among the mountain and water deities."

Wei Ban gazed at him with a melancholic look. "It’s not like the horse isn’t lean, or the man isn’t short of ambition."

Xu Ruo chuckled, casually pointing, "Get lost, quickly."

Wei Ban smiled, "As you command!"

He left.

Xu Ruo pondered for a moment, riding the wind toward Diezhang Peak, where Mountain Lord Jin Qing stood, his expression grave.

Xu Ruo said nothing.

Suddenly, Jin Qing spoke, "In the blazing sun, the people trek the mountains, thousands pulling the ropes, hundreds wielding axes, while the bonfire smolders, to produce this treasure."

Xu Ruo understood that Jin Qing was referring to the history of the Zhu Ying dynasty’s efforts to carve mountains and draw water in search of precious inkstones. 

In life, Jin Qing had been a quarryman, and it was said that he eventually drowned accidentally or was beaten to death by overseers. Even after death, his resentment lingered, yet he did not become a vengeful spirit; instead, he became a protector of the mountains and rivers, ultimately being recognized by the old mountain lord of the Central Peak and gradually promoted to the deity of Diezhang Peak. 

Xu Ruo slowly replied, "There are no rulers in this world who are completely clean. If one were to judge an emperor’s gains and losses purely on the basis of righteousness and morality, it would not be fair. Regarding the nation and the welfare of the people, each of us schools of thought has our own measure, which can vary significantly. You, Jin Qing, as a deity, have never lost your humanity or conscience; I see it and respect it greatly."

Xu Ruo smiled, "However, the complexities of the world are unavoidable; one cannot help but act against their heart. I do not urge you to do anything specific; whether you agree with Wei Ban or refuse his goodwill, you are already worthy of your identity as the mountain lord of the Central Peak. If you are willing, I could almost leave this place now. If you do not wish to compromise, I would be willing to personally hand over a complete sword, completely shattering your golden body, ensuring no one can insult you, Jin Qing, or the Central Peak."

Jin Qing turned around with a smile, "Xu Ruo, if you were to draw your complete sword, how much killing power would it possess?"

Xu Ruo nodded, "After nurturing the sword for years, its killing power is immense."

Jin Qing laughed, "Then it’s better to let someone else experience that sword; I, Jin Qing, cannot handle it."

Xu Ruo hesitated for a moment, reminding him, "When visiting Cloud-Peeking Mountain, the gift doesn’t need to be too extravagant."

Jin Qing scolded with a laugh, "So you’re just a bunch of goods!"

Xu Ruo clasped his fists with a smile, "I’ve troubled you for so long; when you reach the capital, remember to give me a shout. I’ll treat the mountain lord to drinks."

Jin Qing nodded and then asked, "Did Xu Ruo originally intend to come to my Central Peak?"

Xu Ruo paused, saying casually, "You and I are here for the sake of fewer deaths. However, if you ask why our Moke chose the Great Li, resulting in so many deaths in Baoping Continent, I cannot provide you an answer for now, but please keep watching."

Jin Qing remained silent.

Xu Ruo did not return to Dragon Sealing Peak and left the Central Peak, riding the wind toward the northern capital of the Great Li.

He did not like using a sword.

Xu Ruo always believed that swords and sword cultivators should stand on equal footing.

The jade-level sword immortal of the Zhu Ying dynasty, who had been in seclusion for many years, attempted to assassinate the new Great Li patrol official, Cao Ping, but before he could make a move, he was already dead.

In truth, the other party didn’t have to die; Xu Ruo merely injured him severely.

That old man, who had been in seclusion for a hundred years but never managed to break through, would rather die than become a prisoner, nor would he ally with the enemy Song family. Thus, after breaking his sword, with no chance of victory, he surrendered to his fate, laughing and saying that he had known he would die from the start. Dying at the hands of Xu Ruo, the number one swordsman of the Moke, was not too much of a loss.

Xu Ruo made an exception and revealed something.

In the land of Baoping Continent, all the rulers, nobles, and commoners would die out, and the evening dusk would fall without a trace of smoke rising.

The old man, upon hearing this, could only lament before his death.

Pei Qian sat on a bench, surveying her surroundings. The small house and courtyard were just as they had always been, almost giving her the illusion that she and Cao Qinglang were still the same as they were back then. She was merely sent by her master to fetch a bucket of water from the well, and upon returning, she encountered Cao Qinglang, thinking it was just that.

The Spring Festival couplets stuck by the courtyard door, which she had glanced at a hundred times while waiting for Cao Qinglang outside, were well-written but not so impressive as to make her feel inferior.

Cao Qinglang looked at the dark-skinned girl, actually wanting to ask her many questions, such as why, after so many years outside, she had hardly grown taller. Now, the two of them stood side by side, and there was at least a head’s difference in their heights. Why did she suddenly carry a bamboo box and wear a bamboo knife and sword? How had Mr. Chen been during his time studying abroad?

Pei Qian placed the bamboo box behind her, laying her hiking staff across her knees, sitting upright and looking straight ahead, avoiding Cao Qinglang's gaze as she got straight to the point. "Do you know that back in the day, my master actually wanted to take you away from the Lotus Root Blessed Land and had no desire to take me with him?"

Cao Qinglang hesitated for a moment, not rushing to answer. He smiled and asked in return, "Mr. Chen took you as a disciple?"

Pei Qian's eyes gleamed like the sun and moon, and she nodded solemnly, "Yes! I have traveled through thousands of mountains and rivers with my master, and he has never abandoned me!"

Cao Qinglang gently clenched his hands into fists and rested them on his knees, his smile tender. "Though I regret that Mr. Chen didn’t take me away from here, I think traveling thousands of miles alongside him is a beautiful thing, and I envy you for it."

Pei Qian fell silent.

Cao Qinglang turned his head to ask, "Does Mr. Chen still have you fetch water while splashing it around to clean the streets?"

Pei Qian suddenly turned her head, ready to get angry, but upon seeing the smile in Cao Qinglang’s eyes, she felt as though she had all this martial skill but was facing a pile of cotton and unable to exert any strength. She snorted coldly, crossing her arms. "You know nothing, you fool! I’ve learned countless skills from my master and never slacked off. Not only do I copy books and learn to read every day, but I also practice martial arts and punches. Whether my master is here or not, it’s all the same!"

Cao Qinglang feigned realization, "Oh, I see."

Pei Qian felt a bit aggrieved. Why did this fellow still look so displeased after all these years? He seemed even bolder than that timid, sullen boy from back then.

Pei Qian’s eyes brightened, and she asked, "Have you heard of the poem 'Iron Flowers Embroidering the Rock Walls, the Killing Aura Makes the Frogs Croak'?"

Cao Qinglang shook his head.

Now, being half a cultivator, he could read ten lines at a glance, and his memory was remarkable. Ever since he was young, he had loved reading. With the passage of time, his teacher, Shijiu, had willingly lent him books. Even before the world had fractured, Mr. Lu frequently sent him books from other places. It wasn't that Cao Qinglang was boasting; he had already read quite a bit.

Pei Qian asked again, "Do you know how to write the character 'Mi'?"

Cao Qinglang smiled and extended a finger, writing the character 'Mi' in the air, explaining, "The Confucian classics state that in the month of early autumn, the cold air intensifies, and the yang energy wanes, hence the name 'Killing Aura.' The frog croaking signifies the sound of frogs. There’s an ancient saying by a wise man that goes, 'Remove the frogs,' implying something along those lines. I once heard a teacher jokingly say that poetry is about discussing literary embellishments, seeking the origins from bold Suzi and gentle Liuzi. That teacher at the time laughed loudly, saying, 'I laugh heartily, just like the frogs croaking, a small victory over the parrot mimicking speech.'"

Pei Qian remained expressionless, her face stern as she said, "So you know it too."

The essence of her words lay in the "too."

Cao Qinglang certainly didn’t mean to flaunt his mixed knowledge; he merely wanted to understand what kind of person Pei Qian had become. It was strange; she seemed to have changed a lot, yet many aspects remained the same.

Suddenly, Pei Qian said, "Last time we met, I actually wanted to kill you because I was afraid you would take my master away. My master has always cared about you, and not in a casual way. Besides drinking, my master sometimes spoke more about his feelings, but most of the time, he just gazed into the distance, lost in thought. In those moments, his eyes spoke volumes, so I know my master has missed you dearly and always hoped to keep you by his side, fearing you would suffer alone in the Lotus Root Blessed Land."

Pei Qian hesitated, gripping her hiking staff tightly, her knuckles turning white, the veins on the back of her hands bulging. Slowly, she said, "I’m sorry!"

Cao Qinglang nodded gently. "I accept your apology. It’s indeed wrong for you to feel that way. However, since you had that thought and managed to restrain yourself, keeping your heart, ultimately not taking action, I think it’s quite good. So you don’t have to worry about me taking your master away. Since Mr. Chen has taken you as a disciple, if one day you no longer have such thoughts, then neither I, Cao Qinglang, nor anyone else in the world could take him from you."

Pei Qian shouted, "I’m the first disciple to open the mountain, not an ordinary disciple!"

Cao Qinglang helplessly replied, "Alright, alright, impressive, impressive."

Pei Qian glared at him, slowly saying, "You dullard, you really aren’t angry?"

Cao Qinglang slightly propped his elbows, gazing at Pei Qian, mimicking an angry expression as if he were a guardian deity staring wide-eyed at the world. "I’m very angry!"

Pei Qian tugged at the corners of her mouth, "How childish."

Cao Qinglang asked, "Did you come to Nanyuan Country alone this time? Mr. Chen didn’t come?"

Pei Qian shook her head, murmuring, "I came with an old man who teaches me martial arts. We traveled a long way to get here."

Cao Qinglang inquired curiously, "Where is the old man now?"

Pei Qian turned her head, staring blankly towards the direction of the Heart Reflection Temple, remaining silent.

Moments later.

Cao Qinglang was somewhat startled.

He saw Pei Qian, who was slightly taller and not quite as dark as before, with her mouth agape, not crying out loud, but tears streaming down her face.

In an instant, Pei Qian stood up abruptly, her movements so hasty that she knocked the hiking staff off her knees without caring. Then, the ground shook violently as Pei Qian dashed away.

Cao Qinglang couldn’t help but follow, a green robe billowing as he leaped onto the roof, trailing behind the slender figure ahead.

Pei Qian landed outside the corridor of the Heart Reflection Temple, looking angrily at the old man with closed eyes, shouting, "Old man, don’t sleep!"

Pei Qian stomped her foot, stepping back, and assumed a solid martial stance, shouting, "Grandpa Cui, get up and train!"

Cao Qinglang stood behind Pei Qian, as a middle-aged monk rushed over. Cao Qinglang clasped his hands together, apologizing.

The head monk of the Heart Reflection Temple gently nodded, folding his hands in prayer, chanting softly, and slowly left.

Pei Qian maintained her martial stance for a long time.

Cao Qinglang approached Pei Qian, gently pressing down on her fist, "The old gentleman has already passed away."

Cao Qinglang realized he couldn’t push down her fist at all; Pei Qian was lost in her own world. "Grandpa Cui, don’t sleep anymore! We should go home together! This isn’t home; our home is at Desolate Mountain!"

Cao Qinglang had already sensed something unusual about Pei Qian. He could only press down hard on her fist and softly admonish, "Pei Qian!"

Pei Qian’s natural martial intent burned like a hot coal against Cao Qinglang’s palm, yet he showed no change in expression. His feet moved like a celestial being walking on the path, his sleeves filled with a gentle breeze, and with one hand forming a sword gesture, he firmly pushed Pei Qian’s fist down by an inch or more. "Pei Qian, do you really want to let the old gentleman leave in peace, without worries?!"

Having her torrent of martial intent interrupted by Cao Qinglang, Pei Qian seemed to awaken a little, crouching down and crying out in pain, her eyes fixed on the elderly man sitting in the corridor.

In the next moment, the blue-robed elder, who had seemingly fallen into a deep eternal slumber, was stirred by the rhythmic pulse of Pei Qian’s martial intent, the silent energy of the deceased coming to life.

From Cui Cheng’s lightly folded hands appeared two radiant orbs, bright as the sun and moon, the martial intent of a peak tenth-level martial artist surged from his decaying body, streaming into those two orbs. 

Cao Qinglang was blinded by the brilliance and had to close his eyes. Moreover, he was forced back by the overwhelming martial intent that seemed about to collapse the mountains. He could only slide back against the wall, unable to move, his spiritual energy accumulated through cultivation unable to condense.

However, that overwhelming martial intent, akin to the heavens not daring to impose restrictions, had no effect on Pei Qian whatsoever.

Pei Qian clenched her fists and stood up, a bead hanging before her, slowly swirling around her.

The other bead shot toward the sky, crashing into the firmament, shattering like a fine rain of martial energy falling over the Lotus Root Blessed Land.

This martial energy should have belonged to Zhu Lian as he accompanied the old man and the young girl into this brand new Lotus Root Blessed Land. After the old man passed away, Zhu Lian, a martial artist at the realm of distant travel, the current foremost martial artist in the world, could have claimed it easily, but he refused.

Pei Qian didn’t dare to catch the martial energy bead that the old man had left just for her.

What if Grandpa Cui hadn’t died? What if accepting this gift would truly cause Grandpa Cui to die?

Why should there be so much separation and loss in childhood? After finally growing up, must it continue like this?

Cao Qinglang looked at the figure, softly saying, "Even in the hardest of times, do not deceive yourself. If they have left, they have left. All we can do is to make ourselves live better."

Pei Qian, with her back to Cao Qinglang, gently nodded, trembling as she reached out to grasp the martial energy bead.

Pei Qian turned to look at Cao Qinglang, saying, "Grandpa Cui actually had so much to say but didn’t have time to tell my master."

In the small temple, the resounding sound of evening drums echoed.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 665: Two Breakthroughs

Li Er gave Chen Ping'an one last lesson in combat, and it was unlike any before.

Li Er encouraged Chen Ping'an to give it his all, to use any means necessary, and to see how long he could endure under his punches.

Chen Ping'an was puzzled. He was at the sixth realm of martial arts, while Li Er had reached the tenth realm, the pinnacle of martial prowess. What was the point of this exercise, even if he could use every trick in the book?

Li Er chuckled, "My punches will be measured; I will only interrupt the connections of your techniques. Simply put, you just need to strike. Think of it as facing a mortal enemy, one who underestimates you because their cultivation far surpasses yours. In their eyes, you're just a decent martial artist, and they’ll aim to exhaust your pure true energy (Zhenqi), and then slowly wear you down for fun."

Chen Ping'an grew increasingly confused. Did that mean he could use any sneaky or underhanded tactics apart from striking?

Li Er didn’t elaborate further. "Don’t take this lightly. If I feel you’re underestimating your opponent, my final punch could leave you coughing blood on the bed at Lion Peak for half a year."

With that, Li Er turned and walked towards the dock, leaving Chen Ping'an standing at the door of the thatched cottage.

Holding a bamboo staff, Li Er stood at one end of the small boat, gathering his breath and focus. Half a stick of incense later, Chen Ping'an approached the dock.

Li Er glanced over and couldn’t help but smile.

The young man was barefoot, his pants rolled up, but he hadn’t bothered to roll up his sleeves. He hadn’t forgotten the sword he had received from the Fu family in Old Dragon City.

"Board the boat," Li Er instructed.

In an instant, Li Er brought down the bamboo staff, but Chen Ping'an, who had already woven a small talisman into his sleeve, vanished into thin air. He landed on the stone wall of the mystical cave's waterway, using the momentum to spring back, darting back and forth, putting considerable distance between himself and the boat.

When Chen Ping'an landed on the water, he bent low, skimming across the surface. With one hand pressing down, he created ripples, and upon a sudden stop, the two talismans for invoking earth and water exploded in a flash of spiritual light. As he twisted his wrist slightly, a short blade appeared in his right hand, inscribed with the words "Morning Dew," alongside another blade yet to reveal itself, named "Evening Glow," both taken from the assassins of Cutting Deer Mountain.

The tip of the bamboo staff seemed to touch down, but it never actually made contact with the ground. The force didn’t carve a trench in the earth, nor did it stir up dust; this was the mastery of a grandmaster at the pinnacle of martial arts, capable of controlling their power at will.

Ahead of the small boat, the water surged, stones splashed everywhere, and a figure in a blue robe surged forward like the wind, hands wielding blades.

Li Er retracted the bamboo staff and turned to observe, laughing, "Flashy moves, but quite intimidating."

With a casual jab of his bamboo staff, the boat drifted forward. Chen Ping'an dodged the staff with a turn, his left hand weaving a small talisman that flickered out of sight.

Li Er relaxed his grip on the staff before tightening it again. Without turning or glancing back, the staff jabbed backward, striking the now-visible Chen Ping'an in the chest, sending him crashing into the water. If Chen Ping'an hadn’t slightly turned his body, the staff would have pierced right through him, given that Li Er, who had just spoken of "underestimating the enemy" and "showing restraint," could have easily skewered him.

The boat continued its slow advance, needing no further push from the staff. A pure tenth-realm martial artist like Li Er, as he put it, was "full of spirit, a complete person." Once he wielded his true strength, he could saturate the entire waterway with his martial intent.

Li Er smiled. Well, I’ll give you that; you’ve taken advantage of the terrain and used dozens of water talismans. It's barely a turbulent tide.

He gripped the bamboo staff tightly, vibrating with energy. As one person and one boat continued forward, the water stayed clear of both.

With a stomp of his foot, a muffled thunder sounded beneath the water. Li Er, somewhat surprised, ceased paying attention to Chen Ping'an beneath the surface and moved from the back to the front of the boat, glancing at the distant wall. The boat sped forward like an arrow, and he swung the bamboo staff down.

The shadowy spirit, having quietly slipped away, had hidden atop the wall with a ghostly tablet talisman, a clever distraction.

To his surprise, Li Er saw through it easily.

The shadowy spirit had to dodge the heavy bamboo staff. This motion revealed its true form: a young man in white, clutching a folded fan. Even in its hasty retreat, he still wore a smile, his figure ethereal as if he were a celestial being. As he left the wall, Chen Ping'an's shadow spirit made a hand gesture, summoning a glimmering white sword light from his brow—a flying sword still not fully refined into his true essence. While it wasn’t the master’s true flying sword, it had been honed on the Dragon Slaying Platform and now surged forth with tremendous force.

Li Er’s previous bamboo staff had never touched the wall; he bent his arm slightly, drawing back the staff, and sent the flying sword vibrating as it crashed against the wall. The seemingly ordinary bamboo staff, infused with martial intent, remained undamaged.

"Still coming?" Li Er asked with a smile.

A fierce sword, imbued with the aura of a sword immortal, shot towards Li Er’s back.

Unfazed, Li Er knew he had sufficient martial intent to protect himself, the most indestructible defense in the world.

"Hmm, just an imitation sword forged at Hate Sword Mountain?" he mused, as the incoming sword was casually deflected by his martial intent.

A third sword flew at Li Er's back, faster than the rest.

At the same time, the first sword, now as radiant as a white rainbow, attempted to entangle him once more.

Li Er sighed, "Now this is getting a bit annoying."

He released his bamboo staff and vanished in a flash, reappearing with three flying swords in hand, sparks flying from his palm.

By the time Li Er returned to the boat, the bamboo staff appeared to hover in the air, never dropping. His speed was simply too quick.

With one hand restraining the three flying swords, he pushed the bamboo staff forward, causing the boat to tremble slightly.

The bamboo staff angled and shot forward, piercing through Chen Ping'an’s abdomen, pinning him to the bottom of the water. The staff's momentum was shocking, slamming Chen Ping'an down until his back pressed against the bottom, yet it continued through his body.

Li Er’s strike was ruthless.

Chen Ping'an's response was even more ferocious.

With a heavy slap against the water’s surface, it was as if he had pulled himself off the bamboo staff, vanishing in an instant thanks to a small talisman.

Li Er chuckled, not wanting to kick a man while he was down, as he had promised to maintain a mindset of underestimating his opponent.

Chen Ping'an had one redeeming quality: he didn’t feel pain, or rather, before his death, he always remained steady in his strikes.

Some so-called martial geniuses grow stronger the more they are wounded, but they inevitably suffer consequences. Not merely after battles, but during them, they convert their martial intent into fighting power. If both sides are evenly matched, such individuals can certainly survive until the end, for pure martial artists cannot rely solely on their rage or fury. However, without any of that, they have no business walking the path of martial arts. But should there be even a slight difference in cultivation, such actions can have both advantages and disadvantages. The best outcome might be to exchange their life for that of a stronger opponent.

Fighting among martial artists may seem dull and tedious, each exchanging injuries for survival, with few techniques employed, but in reality, it is rife with nuances and meaning.

Especially after entering the tenth realm, the world is vast, full of wonders and limitless vistas.

Song Changjing was ambitious, with grand aspirations. For the purity of martial arts, he was willing to forsake kingdoms, abandon his throne, and his obsession far surpassed that of ordinary masters. What he sought with each punch was to teach those mountain-dwelling immortals to step down, bow, and pay homage to him, Song Changjing.

Thus, his spirit soared.

Li Er believed he had indeed fallen short of Song Changjing in this realm.

After reaching the pinnacle of pure martial arts, regardless of the myriad styles available, martial artists generally have only two paths to follow. One path opens up vast territories, where martial intent is boundless, and those with spirit take precedence. The other path resembles the celestial beings' creation of caves, more easily returning to their essence, where one has no path underfoot but continues to soar higher. Li Er didn’t wish to linger too long in this spirited state; he preferred to follow his nature, with pure martial intent. Deliberately cultivating the spirit was of little benefit; it was better to smoothly ascend to the next realm.

Earlier, while chatting and drinking with Chen Ping'an, Li Er had heard of a remarkable individual named Zhu Lian at Falling Fortune Mountain, nicknamed the "Martial Madman." In battle, he was certain to divide life from death, yet in daily life, his disposition was as serene as a celestial being.

Chen Ping'an pondered deeply, seldom speaking definitively, but when he mentioned Zhu Lian, he claimed that Zhu Lian was the least likely to become obsessed among pure martial artists.

Li Er thus believed Zhu Lian must indeed be an unprecedented genius.

A genius in the eyes of a tenth-realm martial artist.

If there was ever a chance in the future, he would like to meet Zhu Lian.

Li Er put away the bamboo staff, casually tossing the three flying swords aside, and continued to row the boat at a leisurely pace.

Having struck a little harder earlier, the simple man felt a twinge of guilt. When dealing with the elusive and versatile Chen Ping'an, he intentionally tempered his strikes. One punch only knocked Chen Ping'an into the wall but didn’t swap positions with the bamboo staff to pierce through his guts. Moreover, the boat continued forward, leaving the young man, who could surely continue fighting, behind to gather more pure true energy.

Li Er always felt that practicing martial arts didn’t require excessive flair; it was simply about diligently honing one’s body through hardship.

It was much like a farmer tending to his fields; the quality of the harvest still depended on the whims of nature. For martial artists, how far they could go depended entirely on themselves.

Li Er turned to see an odd sight.

Chen Ping'an had donned a golden robe of divine liquor and layered it with a black robe adorned with a hundred-eyed gluttonous creatures, and to top it all off, he wore a flashy ceremonial robe from the colorfully-feathered Chaque Mansion.

It was surprising that after refining these worldly robes, they could adapt to the wearer’s intent. However, with the original blue robe, plus these four additional robes, it looked quite bulky. No matter how he viewed it, Li Er felt a bit uncomfortable, especially with that outermost robe being one meant for ladies. Wasn’t Chen Ping'an being a bit excessive?

Yet this choice wasn’t entirely wrong.

If he had worn the robes from the start, with Chen Ping'an’s current martial realm, it would have hindered the flow of his martial intent, potentially slowing his strikes, which could be a matter of life or death. Now, being heavily injured, it was a different story.

After all, he could withstand a few more punches.

Li Er anchored the boat by the water mirror, stepping onto the surface of the lake with his bamboo staff in hand.

He gazed towards the entrance of the cave-waterway.

There was some movement.

In the distance, Chen Ping'an stood on the water’s surface, sword at his back, without employing any water manipulation techniques or celestial methods. His feet remained stationary, yet he still moved forward slowly.

Li Er looked down at Chen Ping'an’s feet.

Moments later, Chen Ping'an suddenly soared upward.

It turned out he was standing atop a massive, emerald-colored creature—a flood dragon.

This water dragon was indeed a practitioner’s water technique. Its body was reinforced with snow mud talismans as a base, interconnected with over a hundred Great River Flow talismans, forming its skeletal structure. It seemed a bit of the talisman’s spiritual light was also used, reminiscent of two superior methods of refining objects, the techniques of the Three Mountains, along with the Rain-Calling Tablet technique from the Emerald Sea Palace. It was clear these methods shouldn’t merely be considered tools for crafting. At this moment, the dragon’s spine, with its two entwined ropes, became more solid and resilient—one for refining mountains and the other for refining water, with the foundational essence of the Great Dragon Fist as the finishing touch. The young man’s flood dragon seemed to evoke the aura of a celestial being, capable of turning earth into mountains and summoning storms.

Everything in the world requires thought and consideration.

Thus, Chen Ping'an created this massive creature.

Habitually, Chen Ping'an held the knife in his right hand.

In truth, he was left-handed.

The flood dragon charged toward Li Er, crashing against the water mirror, creating towering waves.

Li Er smirked, lightly tapping the ground with the end of his bamboo staff. "This is just a flashy display. It won’t accomplish much."

Li Er leaped lightly, raising the bamboo staff to smash down heavily. Even though the flood dragon was still dozens of feet away from the water mirror, the energy cleaved it in half, though it continued to surge forward due to its momentum.

Li Er swept the bamboo staff outward, and Chen Ping'an, suddenly lowering his head, seemed about to fall to the ground. However, he twisted his body, evading the staff that tore through the air with a thunderous roar. Facing the swiftly vanishing bamboo staff, Chen Ping'an’s sleeves flipped over, and three flying swords shot forth from various points in his body. He quickly stepped down, with his right-hand short knife stabbing toward Li Er's heart, while his left sleeve quietly slid out a second short knife.

Li Er paid no attention to the three flying swords. He delivered a kick to Chen Ping'an's chest, sending him skidding back a dozen feet. Chen Ping'an bent his knees, digging his toes into the ground for leverage, managing to keep his grip on the short knives.

With a shake of his shoulders, he suddenly halted, absorbing the remnants of Li Er's punch.

After all, he was wearing four layers of robes.

Li Er remarked, "I told you long ago, flashy punches and flashy techniques are for those who think they can defeat a master with random strikes. A true master doesn’t rely on that; it’s just a single strike."

He casually tossed the bamboo staff, which sank a foot into the mirror.

The small yet interesting flood dragon, having just reformed on the mirror, scattered into water once more with that jab, and many previously cracked talismans were entirely reduced to dust.

Chen Ping'an began to shift.

Li Er adjusted his trajectory slightly, still perfectly positioned in front of Chen Ping'an, kneeing him in the chest, sending him airborne. Li Er appeared to move slowly as he approached Chen Ping'an’s side, delivering a punch that caused the energy to stagnate within Chen Ping'an’s robes, which began to rip apart, sending him crashing into the lake, skipping like a stone and sliding several feet across the surface.

Li Er took off running, every step crushing the surrounding water’s spiritual energy.

He suddenly moved sideways, colliding his shoulder against Chen Ping'an’s chest, whose body had just executed a small talisman. 

Chen Ping'an felt as if he had been struck by a hammer in his chest, and his shadow spirit soared away, employing a seemingly graceful and peculiar martial art. It seemed to draw arcs and was slow, yet it was mesmerizing, effectively helping Chen Ping'an offload most of the martial intent. When Chen Ping'an steadied himself, his shadow spirit returned to his body in one fluid motion.

Li Er didn’t pursue him, nodding in approval. That was it.

Otherwise, practicing martial arts while cultivating would only hinder the ascent of martial learning; the two would constantly conflict, leading to setbacks.

This time, Li Er’s punches were meant to help Chen Ping'an find that elusive balance—martial artists should not be led astray by their martial intent. Since he was already a cultivator, he should never feel his martial intent was impure. A martial artist should rely solely on their fists, but that doesn’t mean they should ignore everything else. A true master should embody all methods and have a grand vision that allows them to wield them with ease.

The human body is a small universe. I am the heavens.

What can’t be managed? What can’t be controlled?

Now that Chen Ping'an had taken the first correct step on this path, Li Er felt at ease in delivering his strikes.

His punches weren’t heavy but were faster.

He wouldn’t give Chen Ping'an even a moment’s respite to gather his thoughts.

As martial artists, when we engage in combat with Li Er, we must polish our path. Then, my friend, you must show me something that no martial artist in this world possesses!

If you do, take a few more punches. 

If you don’t, then lie down and nurse your wounds!

On the other side of the dock, Li Liu was walking along the waterway, observing the signs of the battle. As for the happenings across the water mirror, she didn’t need to look; she already understood completely.

During her long years, Li Liu was no stranger to pure martial artists. She had perished at the hands of a tenth-realm martial artist and had also personally killed one. She had a great deal of understanding about the paths of martial artists. It was hard to say how significant Chen Ping'an's endurance would be in the annals of the world, but as a sixth-realm martial artist, it was quite rare for him to take so many solid punches.

In the world, ninth-realm peaks and tenth-realm masters who don’t accept disciples, like Gu You, were ultimately few and far between.

Many aspired to emulate their fathers, martial arts masters who tempered their disciples' bodies, but not everyone could endure such training. Some lacked the physicality, while others fell short in temperament; many more were deficient in both, unable to rise to the occasion even with willing mentors. Some who appeared to break through the boundaries were merely punch-bag trainees, losing the true essence of martial arts. Their disciples could cross thresholds but were like those with broken arms or legs, their spirits left with imperceptible flaws. Consequently, when they reached the eighth or ninth realms, various hidden dangers would inevitably surface.

Li Liu arrived at the end of the cave-waterway, choosing not to proceed further but instead turned around to stroll leisurely.

When she reached the dock, she gazed toward the distant scenery outside of Lion Peak, where the scenery was breathtaking.

Li Liu vaguely sensed an unusual occurrence.

Raising her gaze to the sky.

The Confucian temples, dedicated to the seventy-two sages, had always been the most pitiful existence, tightly confining themselves to their bounds.

Neither living nor dead, bound by rules, year after year, gazing down at the mortal realm, they absolutely forbade any interference.

Li Liu once existed in the Northwest Continent, where she held the position of a sect leader at the peak of the celestial realm. She had once exchanged a few words with a Confucian sage stationed above half the continent’s territory.

In the eyes of these sages, who seemed to be floating vessels yet remained still, it was like a mortal gazing down from a mountain peak at the rivers and mountains below. Even they, despite their lofty positions, could not see the complete picture. However, if they used ancient powers to observe the mountains and rivers, even the inscription on a pendant worn by a man in the market or a woman with a head full of black hair and a single white strand could be seen in detail.

Yet such powers grew weary after thousands of years of watching the world.

Moreover, their duty was to monitor the ascendant great practitioners and various upper fifth-realm practitioners' cultivation grounds, to keep an eye on things, lest these individuals, free from constraints, wreak havoc upon the world.

Those in the cave heavens, if they left their little worlds, would shine like beacons, visible even to the mundane scholars atop the mountain peaks, naturally drawing the attention of the sages stationed in the heavens, who would closely observe them. Should there be any violations, the sages would intervene. If everything proceeded according to the rules, they would remain absent.

The Confucian sage who had exchanged a few words with Li Liu had finally laughed, stating that his greatest pleasure was to visit every ten years a certain village’s stone tablet, observing the subtle changes wrought by the elements upon it, insignificant as they were to the world.

Li Liu had no words.

The sages were lonely.

The world remained unaware.

About an hour later, after wandering far and wide, Li Liu gathered her thoughts and turned to smile.

Someone was rowing back, and it was a rather disheveled Chen Ping'an.

Li Er sat in the small boat and said, "You must hold your breath; you’ll need to endure until your martial luck reaches Lion Peak. Otherwise, you won’t be able to accomplish what you set out to do."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Li Er asked, "Are you really not regretting this? Li Liu might know some strange methods to prolong your time here."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "No. The Mountain Shaking Fist was created by Senior Gu You of the North Canglu Continent. During my travels, he taught me three more punches. Even after his death, he still wished to pass on his martial luck to me. So, I have no regrets."

Li Er fell silent.

As the boat with the two of them reached the dock, Li Liu smiled and said, "Congratulations, Mr. Chen. You have successfully broken through in both martial arts and cultivation."

Chen Ping'an grinned, but as he had been deliberately suppressing his true energy and spiritual energy, the moment he relaxed, the effort backfired, and he became covered in blood once more.

Crossing through the mountain water prohibition at the entrance of the cave, Chen Ping'an gently clenched his fist and looked up.

Above the clear skies, a golden sea of clouds suddenly gathered over Lion Peak, followed by a gentle rain falling slowly, thread by thread.

Chen Ping'an murmured, "First and fifteenth."

Two flying swords darted out, flashing past and hovering high before him like a pair of steps.

In a blue robe with a celestial sword at his back, Chen Ping'an began to ascend, stepping onto the two flying sword steps, climbing higher into the heavens.

Stopping just shy of the golden cloud sea and the martial luck rain, he suddenly paused, his martial intent swirling like a deity in the sky, unleashing a punch upwards.

With that one punch, he pushed back the martial luck clouds and rain, causing them to scatter loudly across the North Canglu Continent.

Exhausted, Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, wiped the sweat from his forehead, bent over to catch his breath, and with blurred vision, turned to the south, gently smiling. "Senior Gu, I didn’t dare to tell you before, but back in my hometown, there’s a fellow who said our Mountain Shaking Fist is nothing but rustic. I never thought much of it; it was merely about the essence of the punch. That last punch I just threw was taught to me by him. Rest assured, Senior Gu, I wasn’t convinced back then. When I return to my hometown this time, I’ll definitely argue with him. Now that I’ve reached the Golden Body realm, I can surely take a few more punches and have a proper discussion."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 666: Southbound and Northbound Travels

The master of Lion Peak, Huang Cai, stood beside the founder Li Liu, chuckling softly, “With Mr. Chen’s punch, Lion Peak has truly made a name for itself.”

Li Liu, rarely seen smiling in Huang Cai’s presence, replied, “Huang Cai, you don’t need to call him Mr. Chen on purpose. It’s awkward for both you and him.”

Huang Cai nodded, aware of his master’s temperament.

In one lifetime, Li Liu had casually picked up a child from the roadside, let him bow three times, and accepted him as his sole disciple. The two then established Lion Peak, and after Li Liu’s passing, the then-young Huang Cai, who had just become a Golden Core Earth Immortal, took on the responsibility of leading the sect. Lion Peak stood firm amidst the many sword cultivators of North Julu Prefecture. The child, once as thin as a bamboo pole with a disproportionately large head, ultimately became a renowned and powerful Nascent Soul cultivator in the region.

Suddenly, Li Er spoke up, “He’s wearing four sets of robes; aside from the innermost one which is still decent, the other three can’t withstand a punch—they’re badly damaged.”

Fortunately, before returning to the ferry, he remembered to take off those burdensome robes, especially the outermost one from the Colorful Sparrow Estate. Otherwise, if he were to boldly throw punches like that, soon the entire North Julu Prefecture would hear about a martial artist from Lion Peak who enjoyed wearing women’s clothing.

As for the impact of Chen Ping’an’s punch that shattered the golden sea of clouds, leaving a thick martial aura in North Julu Prefecture, Li Er, having learned of Chen Ping’an’s decision earlier, refrained from sharing too many insider secrets with him. It wasn’t necessary; saying too much might complicate matters and could lead to some impurities in Chen Ping’an's punch intent. He only mentioned that the small group of top martial artists within the nine and ten realms in North Julu Prefecture who sensed the event would feel pleased. Regardless of their personalities or martial virtues, they would have a newfound respect for the young man at Lion Peak today, and all the martial temples throughout the region would harbor gratitude towards him. Not to mention others, even Zhou Mi, a Confucian sage familiar with Huang Cai, would regard Chen Ping’an with new admiration.

Li Liu recalled Chen Ping’an’s flamboyant attire earlier, holding back a laugh, and gently said, “I’ll help Mr. Chen mend his robes.”

Li Er chuckled.

Li Liu sighed, “Father, what are you daydreaming about?”

Li Er replied, “Not daydreaming, just thinking about how we’ll have wine once we descend the mountain. It makes me happy.”

Chen Ping’an swayed slightly, stepping repeatedly onto the flying swords, before finally landing gracefully.

Li Er said, “First, rest on the mountain for half a month. Once you stabilize your Golden Body realm, I’ll help you stretch your muscles and refine your soul. Each time you break through a level, your small human realm will undergo many unimaginable changes. It’s best to strike while the iron is hot and be cautious.”

Chen Ping’an forced a smile, “Uncle Li, let’s talk about that later. Right now, I feel dizzy, and just thinking about practicing punches makes me sleepy. Let me take it slow for a bit.”

Li Er waved his hand with a smile.

Chen Ping’an clasped his fists towards Huang Cai, apologizing, “I haven't had the chance to thank Master Huang properly.”

Huang Cai shook his head, “You don’t need to be polite, Mr. Chen. It’s our Lion Peak that benefited from your fame. Just focus on healing.”

Chen Ping’an’s expression was strange as he bid farewell and left.

Li Er quickly descended the mountain as well.

Li Liu remained in place and remarked, “Benefited from fame? Isn’t that a derogatory term? Huang Cai, I told you years ago to read more instead of just focusing on your cultivation. I heard you have a good relationship with Zhou Mi from the Yu Fu Academy; can you talk to him?”

Huang Cai felt a bit helpless, “Master, I’ve never liked reading since I was a child. Besides, when I interact with Mountain Lord Zhou, we never discuss literature or poetry.”

Li Liu shook his head, “What a waste of that big brain of yours when you were young.”

Huang Cai blinked, touching his own head before recalling that when he was young, he was indeed quite thin and frail, begging along the way until he met his master trudging through the heavy snow.

Huang Cai was momentarily lost for words.

Back then, as a child, he traveled far with his master, eventually choosing this mountain as the site to establish their sect, but Lion Peak didn’t even have a name at that time, and its spiritual energy was quite ordinary. Yet his master chose this place, and upon reaching the summit, glanced at the child and suddenly declared, “From now on, this shall be called Lion Peak.” 

In that moment, his master rarely showed a hint of a smile.

Huang Cai would always remember that scene clearly in this lifetime. Yet, in the following years, he found himself forgetting many things.

Li Liu turned her gaze to the elderly guardian of Lion Peak, realizing that Lion Peak was merely one of her residual caves, perhaps even less significant than the South Wind Water Palace of Dragon Palace. The only reason their family settled here was that Li Liu liked the serene little town at the foot of the mountain, where her mother could open a shop without feeling too out of place. In reality, she had little connection to Lion Peak and Huang Cai.

But for some reason, as she looked at that once frail, monkey-like child’s head, now transformed into a white-haired old man, a peculiar sense of melancholy washed over Li Liu.

Huang Cai’s talents weren’t particularly outstanding, and his temperament was too strong. Managing a patriarch hall in North Julu Prefecture was not an easy task. Huang Cai had faced numerous challenges on his path of cultivation. Although he had once hoped to reach the Jade Purity realm, historical setbacks in his confrontations with sword cultivators had left him entrenched in the Nascent Soul realm.

In fact, when Li Liu first returned to this mountain, she was quite dismissive of her disciple. What was Lion Peak, really? Even if it collapsed into ruins and Huang Cai chose not to rebuild it, what would it matter? She hadn’t invested much effort into cultivating her sole disciple. Instead, she had chosen to focus on her own cultivation, single-mindedly striving to break through to the upper five realms. If she had cared more about Lion Peak, it might have already produced a second Nascent Soul cultivator.

Li Liu wasn’t unaware of Huang Cai’s intentions; on the contrary, she understood them clearly. But in the past, she simply didn’t care.

Yet at this moment, she felt a twinge of sorrow.

Looking at her master, who had never shown such an expression before, she recalled a different figure—always aloof and silent, seemingly pondering grand matters that Huang Cai would never comprehend.

Huang Cai dared not meet his master’s gaze, looking into the distance as if speaking to himself, his voice trembling, “I’m truly glad to be reunited with you in this lifetime, Master.”

Li Liu responded with a soft, “I’m not as happy as you, but I’m alright.” 

The master and disciple fell into a long silence.

Finally, Li Liu spoke gently, “In the future, you don’t need to worry about the restrictions of that cave. You are now the master of Lion Peak; that cave is no longer a place for my cultivation. If there are any good seedlings at Lion Peak, once Mr. Chen leaves, let them enter to cultivate. The three books I gifted you in your early years, you can impart them according to your disciples’ talents and temperaments, without being too rigid about the rules. Besides, I never forbade you from teaching those three ancient water techniques. If you hadn’t been so stubborn, Lion Peak might have already produced a second Nascent Soul cultivator.”

Huang Cai slapped his head, “As you say, Master, I wasted that big brain of mine.”

Li Liu smiled faintly.

Huang Cai fell silent, feeling tranquility settle in his heart. Accompanied by his long-lost master, he gazed at the landscapes of the human realm.

Half a month later, Li Er climbed the mountain again, this time to spar with Chen Ping’an. He instructed Chen Ping’an to engage in pure martial practice as a Golden Body martial artist, forbidding any specific techniques or forms—no traces were allowed. If Li Er detected even a hint of form, Chen Ping’an would have to bear a punch from him at the peak of the ninth realm, reminding Chen Ping’an to strike swiftly. If he hesitated even slightly, it would show disrespect to the hard-won Golden Body realm and he would face consequences.

Eventually, Li Er dragged Chen Ping’an to a small boat. This time, Li Er would guide the boat back to the ferry, noting that they still needed to work on their timing. After half a month of practice, Chen Ping’an was reluctant to refuse such kindness, insisting he needed to leave. Since Qi Jinglong had already broken through, he had to rush to the Taihui Sword Sect to take a look, then visit the Fire Dragon Master on the Ground-Peeking Peak, see another good friend, and finally head south to the Bone Marsh after visiting the cave in Qinghao State.

Li Er didn’t press Chen Ping’an further.

At dawn, the two hurried down the mountain. Li Er curiously asked, “Since you’re in such a rush to go to the Upside-Down Mountain, why not just go straight from North Julu Prefecture? Why take a detour through the Treasure Bottle Continent? It’s not like the Fallen Mountain has legs, and with Zhu Lian and Wei Ba helping you out, you really don’t need to worry. If you miss the Bone Marsh and go to the Treasure Bottle Continent, the cross-continent ferry only operates from Old Dragon City, and that’s quite a long way. Isn’t that troublesome?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “I can’t leave without seeing home first; I just can’t rest easy.”

Li Er fell silent.

In recent days, he had shared so much with Chen Ping’an while helping him train that it felt more exhausting than actual practice.

Arriving at the fabric shop at the foot of the mountain, Li Liu was helping inside. Business was slow, and Chen Ping’an hesitated, finally unable to resist speaking up, “Miss Li, do you know why business isn’t great for you selling fabric here?”

Li Liu nodded.

The town's women and young girls were reluctant to see her. Even if she tried to exaggerate the quality of her fabrics, those mundane women would inevitably feel uncomfortable as long as she stood in the shop. After all, buying fabric and adding a little charm didn’t matter; just seeing her would be disheartening.

Li Liu preferred staying in the shop mainly to spend more time with her mother.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “You could have a couple of less beautiful fairies from Lion Peak pick a bustling time in the street to buy silk twice—once less and once more. When they come, they should wear the clothes made from the silk they bought from this shop. That way, you won’t have to worry about the shop’s business and can chat more with Aunt Liu in the back courtyard.”

Li Liu laughed, “I can try that clever plan taught by Mr. Chen.”

Earlier, when the woman saw Chen Ping’an’s complexion and served tea, she immediately asked if he was ill.

Chen Ping’an hurriedly shook his head with a smile, “No, no, just a bit of a cold. Aunt Liu doesn’t have to worry.”

The woman shared some local remedies for health maintenance, urging him not to disregard them.

At the dining table that day, there were four people.

When Aunt Liu heard Chen Ping’an had already eaten and was leaving the town today, she felt a bit down.

However, upon hearing that Chen Ping’an was willing to write a letter home for her, addressed to the Dae Sui Academy, she immediately brightened up.

Li Liu turned to Li Er, who merely smiled and took a sip of wine, savoring the moment.

In Li Huai’s room, Chen Ping’an took out ink and paper, with Aunt Liu sitting beside him. Li Er and the woman sat on a long bench, while Li Liu faced Chen Ping’an across the table.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Aunt Liu, you speak, and I’ll write. Let’s include a lot of trivial matters to reassure Li Huai.”

The woman looked at the young man in the azure robe, clean and upright. She felt inexplicably touched and softly said, “Ping’an, how wonderful it would be if your parents were still around. Aunt Liu is just a simple woman without much insight, but as a mother myself, I can say that any parent would be proud to have a son like you.”

Chen Ping’an lowered his gaze, his expression calm. Then he raised his head slightly and smiled, “Aunt Liu, I wish my parents were here too. But I was too young back then and couldn’t do much. In fact, these years have been quite difficult.”

The woman felt guilty for bringing up such a sad topic and quickly said, “Ping’an, I was just talking casually. Write what you can, and for what can’t be written, just skip it.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “There’s plenty of paper, Aunt Liu. Speak more; if the letter is longer, it might be a good omen.”

The woman sighed heavily, then turned to glare at Li Liu, “Did you hear that?! In the past, when I asked you to help write letters, you’d barely fill a piece of paper. Do you even remember your brother and your mother? Have I raised such a heartless daughter?”

Chen Ping’an gave a polite smile of apology to Li Liu across the table.

Li Liu quietly nodded in acknowledgment, then folded her hands in front of her, pleading with her mother, “Mother, I know I was wrong.”

Then in the small room, only the woman’s incessant chatter and Chen Ping’an’s focused writing could be heard.

That young man, who had traveled thousands of miles and read countless books, sat upright, his back straight, with a serious expression.

Finally, with a bamboo box on his back and a mountain staff in hand, Chen Ping’an left the shop. The woman and the man stood at the door, watching him depart.

The woman insisted that Li Liu see him off.

Li Liu carried a package, filled with items her mother had prepared, mostly local specialties.

Of course, there were also three robes that she had personally mended.

The woman muttered softly, “Li Er, do you think our daughter will find such a good man in the future?”

Li Er pondered, “Difficult.”

The woman stepped on the back of Li Er’s foot, poking his forehead with her finger, again and again, “Then you should be more attentive! Just let him go like this? You drink and don’t hold back, but can’t manage a thing. What kind of man have I ended up with? What kind of father are you to Li Liu and Li Huai? Is it that the heavens are blind, or did we not accumulate enough virtue in our past lives?!”

Li Er remained silent, not daring to evade.

The woman sighed, reluctantly withdrawing her hand. She couldn’t keep poking at him; her husband was just a dense blockhead. If she wasn’t careful, she might hurt her own head.

On the main street of the town, the two walked side by side.

Li Liu softly said, “Mr. Chen, Huang Cai will take you to the ferry, which will take you directly to the nearby Huanyou Ferry of Taihui Sword Sect. Once you get off the boat, it’s only a few steps to Taihui Sword Sect. The first person to visit Taihui Sword Sect to ask about the sword will be Li Cai from Floating Duck Sword Lake. This is the old custom of North Julu Prefecture; Mr. Chen doesn’t need to think too much about it.”

At this point, Li Liu smiled, “I forgot that Mr. Chen is the most concerned about customs.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “But I still have too little understanding and insight regarding reasonable customs. I have no idea what true etiquette is.”

Li Liu refrained from commenting on that, mainly unwilling to dictate.

Li Liu asked, “Does Mr. Chen not yearn for pure and absolute freedom?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “I do admire that kind of unfettered existence, but I’ve always believed that without sufficient understanding to support that absolute freedom, it’s neither stable nor safe.”

As the two rounded a corner on the street, they soon spotted the elder Nascent Soul Mountain Master of Lion Peak, who had been using an illusion spell.

Li Liu removed the package from her hand, and Chen Ping’an did the same with the bamboo box.

Li Liu intended to open the bamboo box herself, but at that moment, she handed over the package, smiling, “Are you worried about being misunderstood? In fact, the neighbors have probably already misunderstood.”

Chen Ping’an placed the package into the bamboo box, slinging it back over his shoulder, smiling without speaking.

Finally, Li Liu sent him a mental message, “In the world of Qingming, there is a mysterious Daoist temple called Xuandu Temple, which is the ancestral home of the Sword Immortals. The head of the temple is named Sun Huai Zhong, and he is an open-minded and jovial person.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Thank you, Miss Li, for giving me peace of mind.”

Under Huang Cai’s personal guidance, Chen Ping’an engaged in casual conversation with the master of Lion Peak before saying goodbye. Ultimately, he boarded a beautifully crafted ferry boat heading to the Huanyou Ferry. There were quite a few people aboard, many of whom were also headed to the Taihui Sword Sect, discussing animatedly. It was entirely normal since the land-bound dragon of North Julu Prefecture had already broken through, and three astonishing sword challenges were about to unfold, involving the female sword immortal Li Cai, Dong Zhu, and the foremost sword immortal Bai Chang!

In addition, they were all chattering about the golden sea of clouds and martial fortunes of Lion Peak.

They speculated whether Lion Peak had been hiding a pure martial artist or if it was a passing traveler.

Upon entering his quarters, Chen Ping’an opened the bamboo box, ready to retrieve the three robes to keep close, but when he opened the package, he discovered that, aside from the various food items and local specialties prepared by Aunt Liu, there was also a beautifully crafted green jade token. It was infused with Li Liu’s mountain and water restrictions, which concealed its spiritual energy, which was why Chen Ping’an hadn’t sensed it beforehand. He sighed, realizing that not only had he benefitted from the food and training but had also received such a precious gift in return. How could he act so much like a guest?

The jade token was inscribed with “Old Dragon Calming the Storm.”

After securing the robes, Chen Ping’an began to continue refining the spiritual energy from three key acupoints.

The journey was uneventful.

Arriving at the Huanyou Ferry, which was only about three hundred miles from the Taihui Sword Sect, Chen Ping’an found it crowded, filled with cultivators eager to join the excitement.

As the ferry entered the Taihui Sword Sect’s territory, Chen Ping’an sent a message to Qi Jinglong via flying sword.

On the ferry, he didn’t see Qi Jinglong but spotted a familiar young boy from Luer Mountain, Bai Shou.

Bai Shou rushed over through the crowd like a fish swimming, grinning widely as he spotted Chen Ping’an and gave him a thumbs-up.

Chen Ping’an asked curiously, “When did you become so cheerful?”

Bai Shou laughed heartily, “Chen, do you know a person from Yunzhuang City named Xu Xingjiu?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “I do know him.”

Bai Shou doubled over with laughter, “Good heavens! That Liu fellow is living large now, greeting guests all day long. When he first heard that Xu Xingjiu sent a mountain tribute and claimed to know ‘Mr. Chen’, Liu turned down several invitations and went down the mountain to see him. I tagged along, and guess what? That guy learned to carry a big bamboo box just like you. After some polite exchanges, he said, ‘I heard that Liu loves drinking, so I took the liberty of bringing some wine brewed in Yunzhuang City.’”

Bai Shou was laughing so hard he was almost in tears, “You have no idea what Liu’s expression was then, like someone who forgot to bring toilet paper to the restroom!”

Chen Ping’an sighed, “This Xu Xingjiu misinterpreted my intentions, he really did.”

Bai Shou raised both hands, shaking his fists vigorously, “Chen, I admire you!”

Chen Ping’an quietly asked, “Is your master busy? So busy that he couldn’t come to welcome me and sent you, this little lackey, to fill in?”

Bai Shou grinned, “You’re the little lackey! I am a natural talent at Taihui Sword Sect, and Liu burns incense every day, thanking the heavens for taking in such a good disciple like me.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled as he ruffled the boy’s hair.

Bai Shou didn’t dodge, angrily saying, “Don’t be so presumptuous! Chen, I’m doing you a big favor; that’s why we can call each other brothers. If you keep pushing, just go to Taihui Sword Sect on your own. I won’t bother showing you the way.”

Upon reaching the entrance of the Taihui Sword Sect, Qi Jinglong stood there with a stern expression.

Chen Ping’an juggled the bamboo box, trotting over while smiling, “Wow, you broke through so quickly!”

Qi Jinglong tugged at the corners of his mouth, “Not really, compared to you, Chen the Great Sword Immortal, I’m still far behind. Breaking through two bottlenecks in martial cultivation in one go isn’t that impressive.”

Chen Ping’an waved it off, “I don’t dare take the credit.”

Bai Shou interjected impatiently, “You two are never-ending with your flattery. Is this interesting?”

The boy grinned mischievously, “Why not bring out a couple of jars of wine and chat while drinking? Liu, this time, just take it easy and drink slowly.”

He admired Xu Xingjiu. When they arrived at the hut on the mountain, that guy didn’t hesitate to drink heartily, going through two jars of wine in no time. If Liu hadn’t stopped him, it looked like he would’ve downed three jars just to feel satisfied. Although the jar was small, for a cultivator suppressing their spiritual energy, that kind of drinking was truly remarkable.

The three slowly ascended the mountain, with Qi Jinglong often greeting people along the way, but he didn’t pause for idle chatter.

Chen Ping’an held back a laugh and asked, “Did Xu Xingjiu return?”

Qi Jinglong sighed, “We had a drink together, and he was drunk for a day. After sobering up, I managed to clarify things for him. But then he started drinking punishment wine again, and I had to accompany him for a bit.”

Chen Ping’an burst into laughter.

Qi Jinglong grunted, “This better not happen again.”

Chen Ping’an secretly chuckled, lightly high-fiving Bai Shou.

Bai Shou thought Chen was quite amusing; he could come to Taihui Sword Sect often.

If he didn’t visit himself, he could send wine to Liu. That sounded much better and more entertaining than just dawdling around all day and counting stars at night.

The Taihui Sword Sect sprawls across a vast area, with towering peaks, clear waters, and abundant spiritual energy. As Chen Ping’an couldn’t ride the wind to travel far, he took out a symbolic boat. Liu Jinglong led the way as they headed to their cultivation place.

It was a renowned spot in North Julu Prefecture.

At the hut, Bai Shou brought three bamboo chairs, and they each took a seat.

Suddenly, Qi Jinglong said, “Can I borrow a Gu Yu coin?”

Chen Ping’an tossed him a coin, curious, “Are you this poor at your home mountain?”

Qi Jinglong caught the coin, pinching it between two fingers. With his other hand, he drew a symbol in the air, tossing the coin into it. The light from the symbol faded, and the coin disappeared. He then grumbled, “The disciples of the sect are supposed to pay their dues every ten years. If I need divine money urgently, I can borrow it, but that’s not my style. I wouldn’t even bother borrowing from you, Chen Ping’an.”

Chen Ping’an turned to Bai Shou, “Did you hear that? This is what a master should say in front of his disciples.”

Bai Shou was just about to throw in some sarcastic remarks when he noticed Liu smiling at him. Bai Shou swallowed his words. After all, he still had to stay on the mountain and face Liu every day. He couldn’t afford to act impulsively.

Chen Ping’an smiled at Bai Shou, “You can go relax; I need to speak with your master about some matters.”

Bai Shou refused to budge, teasing, “What? Are you two planning to share secrets? Am I not allowed to listen?”

Chen Ping’an intertwined his fingers, cracking them with a smile, “Bai Shou, I’ve suddenly discovered you have a talent for martial arts. It’s a shame you’re not practicing; would you like me to help you train?”

Bai Shou retorted, “I don’t want to be a sword immortal! Why would I want to go practice martial arts?”

Nevertheless, he got up and wandered off.

This mountain was called Flitting Peak, a coveted spot for Qi Practitioners, located between the main peak and secondary peak of Taihui Sword Sect. Every spring and autumn, spiritual energy would surge toward Flitting Peak, especially with strands of pure sword intent, enabling cultivators to enjoy the benefits simply by staying on the mountain. After the second sect master passed away, this peak had remained unoccupied by any cultivators. Historically, a Jade Purity realm sword cultivator had even offered to take over the peak for cultivation in exchange for being recognized as a patron of Taihui Sword Sect, but the sect had still declined.

Liu, not knowing any better, was reluctant to leave Taihui Sword Sect’s ancestral mountain and moved to Flitting Peak, claiming he was accustomed to the old house over there. Eventually, after reaching the Nascent Soul sword cultivator stage, he was repeatedly urged by the patriarch hall to move over.

This year, during spring, Liu had still been in seclusion. Traditionally, every year, all disciples of Taihui Sword Sect could come here to share the spiritual energy. This year, however, they didn’t dare come anymore. Bai Shou ran to the patriarch hall, conveying Liu’s instructions to a kindly old patriarch. Consequently, this spring, many young cultivators still came to the mountain, but compared to past bustling scenes, everyone was quietly cultivating, not speaking, and refining their sword intent.

In contrast, the boy who was half the owner of Flitting Peak sat motionless, arms crossed, meditating alone for an entire day and night.

Thus, the young disciples of Taihui Sword Sect increasingly regarded Liu’s disciple as an oddball.

After Bai Shou left, Chen Ping’an recounted his recent experiences to Qi Jinglong.

There were no secrets, just varying degrees of detail.

Once he mentioned He Xiaoliang and the Qingliang Sect, along with the grievances involving Bai Chang and Xu Xuan, Qi Jinglong said, “Currently, the news from the usual mountain and water reports hasn’t been released yet. In fact, Heavenly Lord Xie Shi has already returned to the sect. The disciple who previously had a conflict with the Qingliang Sect was scolded by the Heavenly Lord and immediately went down the mountain to apologize. Upon returning to the sect, he began secluding himself. After that, the Yang clan from the Dayuan Dynasty’s Chongxuan Division, along with Water Dragon Sect and Floating Duck Sword Lake, all with intertwined interests, sent people to visit the Qingliang Sect. Yunxiao Palace is represented by the young Heavenly Lord Yang Ningxing, Water Dragon Sect by the Southern Sect’s Shao Jingzhi, and Floating Duck Sword Lake even sent the sect master Li Cai personally. With this, regardless of what Xu Xuan thinks, the Qionglin Sect won’t fare well.”

Chen Ping’an frowned, “So, the rumor that Bai Chang plans to personally challenge Taihui Sword Sect is actually a good thing for you?”

Qi Jinglong nodded with a smile, “For one, Bai Chang has always been arrogant, so he won’t bully me, a recently promoted Jade Purity realm cultivator, based on his rank. Even without this incident, if he’s willing to draw his sword, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Secondly, as you guessed, Bai Chang is indeed under some pressure. He must actively build a connection with Taihui Sword Sect to mitigate any ‘what-ifs.’ After all, there are sword immortals in North Julu Prefecture who don’t look kindly upon me. With Bai Chang as the main sword, along with the previous two predecessors, this series of challenges will put me at ease. It will only benefit me without any threat to my life.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and asked, “With such good news, shouldn’t we drink some wine to celebrate?”

Qi Jinglong surprisingly nodded and extended his hand.

Chen Ping’an took out two jars of glutinous rice wine, puzzled, “Has your personality changed so much after becoming a top five realm cultivator?”

Qi Jinglong accepted the jar with a smile, “It’s not to celebrate our breakthroughs, but rather to celebrate our reunion.”

Chen Ping’an’s journey of trials wasn’t easy, nor was the journey of a Nascent Soul sword cultivator breaking through.

The fact that they could both be alive and reunite was worth more than any breakthrough.

Qi Jinglong was willing to drink this kind of wine.

The two clinked their jars gently, smiling at each other, sharing unspoken camaraderie as they drank.

Suddenly, Chen Ping’an said softly, “There’s nothing good in the jianghu.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “The wine is acceptable.”

Bai Shou, seemingly off wandering, hadn’t gone far. He had been eavesdropping on their “private conversation.”

The boy shivered, hugging his shoulders, complaining, “What’s with these two old men? They’re so mushy! This isn’t right, this isn’t right…”

However, Bai Shou found Chen Ping’an somewhat frighteningly unreasonable. After all, the old seniors from Luer Mountain had warned him that the most tight-lipped people were often the most dangerous. This good man, who had only recently reached this level of cultivation, had such experiences and capabilities. Bai Shou had never realized how high and mighty he was until now. 

He felt a chill, recalling how he once attempted to assassinate this good man. A sense of dread washed over him. This fellow, who casually spoke of training with top-tier martial artists, treated it as if it were just drinking wine; was his mind truly in a pit, or were there two pits? 

He couldn’t mess with him, couldn’t mess with him. He would have to be more polite when speaking with Chen Ping’an in the future and be more sincere when calling him brother. By the time Chen Ping’an became a Golden Core Earth Immortal, he would be a master in the nine or ten realms; Bai Shou would be proud to have such an esteemed figure as a friend.

Suddenly, the words of Qi Jinglong broke into his thoughts, “Having eavesdropped for so long, what do you think? Want to join us for a drink?”

Bai Shou, acting serious, replied, “Drink what? At my young age, I can’t waste time on such things!”

Chen Ping’an clicked his tongue, “You’re truly Liu’s disciple; your ability to adapt is not much worse than my first disciple’s.”

Bai Shou felt somewhat insulted; he could tolerate being called a lackey, but saying that he was inferior to Chen Ping’an’s disciple was too much for him, and he turned around, loudly proclaiming, “Chen, you tell your disciple, Bai Shou from Flitting Peak, that whenever he has time, he should meet with me! I’ll challenge him in any way—whether through literature, martial arts, Dao techniques, or swordsmanship, it’s all up to him!”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Literature sounds fine, but martial arts is out of the question. My first disciple is still in school.”

Bai Shou shook his head, “He’s just lucky!”

The boy swaggered off, his steps light and carefree.

Unbeknownst to him, those few careless words would lead to him receiving many beatings in the future, and the famous saying of Bai Shou, the sword immortal of Flitting Peak, would become “Trouble comes from careless words.”

Having finished their drinks, Chen Ping’an stood up, saying, “I won’t delay your welcoming duties any longer. Besides, I still have three matches to fight; I need to continue on my journey.”

Qi Jinglong didn’t try to keep him. He seemed prepared, pulling out a book from his sleeve and saying, “This is a compilation of insights on sword cultivation methods. You can read it when you have time.”

Chen Ping’an tucked it away, asking, “At your Taihui Sword Sect, if I ride the symbolic boat for a long journey, but don’t know the way, will it cause any trouble?”

Big sects have many rules, especially the sword sects. Just the routes cultivated by sword cultivators are of great significance.

Qi Jinglong smiled, “You’re still aware that you’re at Taihui Sword Sect?” 

Chen Ping’an pretended to be astonished, “Once I reach the upper five realms, my speech has become so assertive! If I were at the Fallen Mountain, I wouldn’t dare say such things.”

Chen Ping’an suddenly remembered something, pulling out a heavy bag filled with Gu Yu coins that he had prepared earlier, leftovers from his dealings with the Fire Dragon Master. He smiled, “One hundred coins. If they’re cheap, help me buy seven or eight imitation swords from Hate Sword Mountain. If they’re too expensive, if one imitation sword costs more than ten coins, just get one or two. With the rest, go buy good items from Sanlang Temple; what you buy is up to you.”

Qi Jinglong nodded in agreement.

Then, Chen Ping’an took the symbolic boat back to the Huanyou Ferry, planning to visit Zhang Shanfeng at the Ground-Peeking Peak.

Before taking off, he called out to Bai Shou, who was strolling on Flitting Peak, “Your master owes me a Gu Yu coin; remind him about it from time to time.”

Bai Shou, who had just been thinking about how to lecture Chen Ping’an on proper etiquette, couldn’t help but raise a middle finger.

At the hut, Qi Jinglong nodded, showing a semblance of a disciple.

At the Taihui Sword Sect, clusters of female cultivators gathered together, whispering excitedly. 

In comparison to the male cultivators’ curiosity about the young man’s cultivation level, realm, and background, the female cultivators’ discussions were entirely different.

They were all talking about the esteemed guest who had Liu and his master personally come out to greet him. Upon hearing that he was a young man carrying a large bamboo box and wearing an azure robe, they couldn’t help but inquire about his appearance and demeanor. 

Those who had seen the two ascend the mountain from afar hesitated before saying, “He’s acceptable.” This prompted other girls to lament, feeling that their young master Liu had suffered a great injustice.

Meanwhile, Qi Jinglong could never have imagined that the young cultivators within the sect would have such chaotic thoughts. If he had heard about it, he wouldn’t have understood it either.

He guessed he would still need to ask Chen Ping’an for guidance to clear up any confusion.

Bai Shou returned to the hut, muttering, “Is he really leaving just like that? Liu, does he even consider you a friend at all?”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “Once you have a friend of your own, you’ll know the answer.”

Bai Shou insisted, “I’m friends with Chen! We met without knowing each other, and it was like meeting an old friend. We share drinks and brothers’ sentiments…”

Qi Jinglong waved his hand, “Let’s go to the patriarch hall.”

Bai Shou immediately looked dejected, “Can’t we go tomorrow?”

Qi Jinglong said nothing.

Bai Shou grumbled to himself but obediently followed Qi Jinglong as they rode the wind to the main peak’s patriarch hall.

Generally, Liu would only mention something once, and even if he would be chatty during the process, once he was done, he wouldn’t say another word. It would be Bai Shou’s turn to take action.

While flying, Bai Shou realized that Qi Jinglong suddenly remembered something and pulled out a heavy coin bag, shaking it, as if listening to the sound to count the coins.

Qi Jinglong smiled, “It’s good; it’s not ninety-nine coins.”

Bai Shou asked, “What’s going on?”

Qi Jinglong only said it was nothing.

Bai Shou felt a twinge of jealousy. What was going on between Liu and that good man?

Chen Ping’an hadn’t anticipated that Zhang Shanfeng had already gone down the mountain to travel with his senior brother, Yuan Ling.

The one receiving guests was the peak master of the Baiyun lineage, an elder with an air of immortality, who personally came to the mountain gate to apologize to Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an learned that the Fire Dragon Master was still asleep and said he wouldn’t ascend the mountain this time, requesting the elder for forgiveness for not entering, promising to inform them ahead of time the next time he visited North Julu Prefecture.

The elder didn’t say much, his expression gentle, only commenting that Chen Ping’an’s phrase “remaining” was quite interesting.

Chen Ping’an felt a bit embarrassed, saying it was a saying from his homeland.

The elder personally escorted Chen Ping’an to the ferry before bidding farewell and returning to the mountain.

Chen Ping’an boarded a boat heading to Spring Dew Garden, leaning against the railing, lost in thought.

Upon reaching Spring Dew Garden, he could directly head to the southernmost point of North Julu Prefecture, the Bone Marsh.

However, in the meantime, Chen Ping’an needed to disembark midway to visit Qinghao State, a small country without a fairy ferry, requiring a journey of over a thousand miles.

Li Xisheng was currently in a state city, residing on a street called Cave Immortal Street.

What Chen Ping’an didn’t know was that not long after he left Taihui Sword Sect, a white-clad youth with a mole on his forehead, carrying a green bamboo staff, boarded a return ferry from the Pima Sect, heading to the Bone Marsh.

The teacher returned south, while the student traveled north.

When the youth reached the Bone Marsh, the first thing he did was tear open a section of the sky curtain in the small world of Ghost Valley, raining down an incredibly dazzling array of magical treasures towards the top of Jingguan City. Afterward, he collected the treasures and fled.

The heroic spirit Gao Cheng of Jingguan City, unaware of why, did not pursue the white-clad youth.

Seated high on the Bone King’s throne, Gao Cheng couldn’t help but frown. Why, upon seeing this person, did the unease that had been intermittent suddenly become clearer?

Not only did Gao Cheng not recklessly break the sky curtain with his magical form again, but he also felt an unprecedented sense of inexplicable restraint.

At the foot of Muwi Mountain, the youth was in a shop, wanting to buy a painting of the goddess of the corridor, looking pitifully as he haggled with a girl, saying he was young, studying far from home, and was low on funds. He was delighted to see these goddess paintings and, despite being hungry, would rather buy them.

Seeing his sincere words and earnest eyes, the girl felt that if he continued this way, he would probably end up in tears. She had no choice but to give him a discount. After the youth negotiated the price, he expressed his gratitude and waved his sleeve, saying, “I’ll take all the goddess paintings in the store at this fair price!”

The girl was left dumbfounded.

The shameless white-clad youth turned around, and the Pima Sect’s master, Zhu Quan, stood nearby with a smile, “Little brother, you’re quite ambitious.”

Cui Dongshan blinked, clutching his green bamboo staff, “Of course! I’m the favored disciple of my master. Sister, where are you from?”

Zhu Quan looked at the staff with a strange expression, “Your master wouldn’t happen to be surnamed Chen, would he?”

Cui Dongshan grinned, “Sister, you’re quite perceptive; you’re like a fortune teller!”

Zhu Quan teased, “I’ve never heard him mention you.”

The next moment, Zhu Quan became even more perplexed.

How strange; this fellow had just been happily smashing treasures above Gao Cheng’s head in Jingguan City, and now, the handsome youth before him was frowning with tears streaming down his face.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 667: Suddenly, a Traveler

Chen Ping'an left the ferry midway, heading towards Qinghao Country, an isolated corner of North Julu Continent. 

With a journey stretching over a thousand miles, Chen Ping'an chose winding mountain paths, traveling day and night, his figure swift as lightning. 

Before long, he found the state city. As he stepped onto the narrow Dongxian Street, the door of a household swung open, revealing a tall man in a scholar's robe, who smiled and waved. 

Chen Ping'an looked up, momentarily lost in thought. 

Shaking off his distractions, he quickened his pace. 

Li Xisheng stepped down the stairs, and Chen Ping'an performed a respectful bow, saying, “Greetings, Mr. Li.” 

Li Xisheng returned the bow with a smile. 

Inside, the young Cui Si watched the long-awaited reunion between the two fellow townsmen. Especially upon seeing the smile on Mr. Li's face, Cui Si felt his own spirits lift. 

After arriving in North Julu, Mr. Li often wore a frown, as if many matters awaited his consideration. But in this moment, he appeared carefree, as if nothing troubled his mind. 

Li Xisheng led Chen Ping'an into the house, turning back with a smile, “I almost didn't recognize you.” 

Chen Ping'an laughed and replied, “I suspect that when I next see Xiao Baoping at the academy, I’ll feel the same way.” 

In Li Xisheng's study, the room was modest, with few books and no superfluous writing supplies or ancient artifacts adorning the walls. 

Li Xisheng instructed Cui Si to read on his own. 

He pulled out a chair from behind the writing desk and sat across from Chen Ping'an, who had just removed his bamboo hat and box. 

Li Xisheng nodded, saying, “Very good, your heart seems steadier now.” 

Chen Ping'an scratched his head. 

Li Xisheng smiled, “There are some things that were not suitable to discuss before, but now I think it’s time to share with you.” 

Sitting upright, Chen Ping'an replied, “Please, Mr. Li, go ahead.” 

Li Xisheng began, “I’ve always felt unclear about myself.” 

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, “That is true.” 

Li Xisheng shook his head with a smile, “Not quite the same.” 

He continued, “Do you remember how I wanted to give you a peach talisman back in the day?” 

Chen Ping'an nodded gently. 

Li Xisheng continued, “Before that, I had a duel with the sword cultivator Cao Jun in Niping Alley, right?” 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “You left Cao Jun quite helpless.” 

Li Xisheng said slowly, “In Lihuzhu Cave Heaven, the path of cultivation for Qi practitioners is arduous, yet I broke through quite rapidly, surpassing even Ma Kuxuan from Xinghua Alley, who left Lihuzhu Cave Heaven after me.” 

Chen Ping'an fell silent, waiting for him to continue. 

Li Xisheng revealed the truth with an air of gravity, “I later deduced the reason—what was meant for you, your share of fortune, or rather, your chance at the Dao, ended up with me. Like you, I’ve always believed in balance in the world; if you gain, I must lose. Every ‘one,’ great or small, cannot simply vanish or appear from nowhere.” 

Just as Chen Ping'an opened his mouth to speak, Li Xisheng waved a hand, “Wait until I finish.” 

Li Xisheng elaborated, “You and I think similarly and act similarly. Once we know something, we must act to find peace of mind. Although I did not know beforehand that I had taken your share of the Dao, once my realm elevated and my insight deepened, leading me to this clear conclusion, it was only right that I could not accept it calmly. Although I still do not know the true origin of that peach talisman, it was undoubtedly significant for me. It was for this reason that I wanted to give it to you—a form of mutual exchange. I take from you, you take from me, restoring our balance. At that time, it was not that my realm was higher or that the peach talisman was particularly precious; it simply should have been an equal exchange. However, since you were unwilling to accept it, I had to step back. So I told Li Er from Lion Peak that whether it was a talisman or a talisman drawn on a bamboo hut, if you come to see me out of gratitude, it will only bring us both trouble, complicating matters further. It would be better not to meet.” 

Chen Ping'an remained calm and nodded slowly. 

Li Xisheng smiled, “As for that book ‘True Records of Alchemy’ and some talisman papers, they are separate from this. As Li Baoping's elder brother, I simply wish to express my gratitude for your protection along her journey.” 

Chen Ping'an nodded again. 

Suddenly, a hint of melancholy shadowed Li Xisheng's face as he said softly, “Chen Ping'an, are you not curious why my brother is named Li Baozhen, and why Li Baoping also has ‘Bao’ in her name, yet mine is different?” 

Among the three Li siblings of Fulu Street: Li Xisheng, Li Baozhen, and Li Baoping. 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I’ve never thought about it.” 

He recalled the little girl in the red cotton cloak who used to speak candidly with his little master, having heard that her mother seemed to favor her second son, Li Baozhen, over her eldest, Li Xisheng. For Chen Ping'an, matters concerning Baoping's family were merely idle gossip, not something to delve deeper into. 

Li Xisheng stood up and walked to the window, gazing into the distance. 

In the Li family, every Spring Festival, there was an unwritten family custom. Their mother would have the servants recite idioms and verses containing the character “Li,” such as the auspicious “Peach and plum trees do not speak, yet a path is formed beneath them,” the charming “The peach blossoms are bright,” and even if a child accidentally said the not-so-favorable “Common peaches and plums,” their mother would not be angry, still giving them a new year’s gift. However, when she heard the phrase “To return a peach with a plum,” her smile would dim significantly. Upon hearing the saying “Peach replaces Plum,” her usually warm demeanor would turn to one of rare anger. 

At that time, Li Xisheng was still a youth, standing not far away at the corner of the hand-pulled noodles’ corridor, witnessing that scene and hearing those words. 

Back then, Li Xisheng did not understand, burying his curiosity deep within. At first, it did not seem like a big deal, but he felt a vague unease. 

Since ancient times, poetry and phrases have always been closely tied to peaches and plums. 

Li Xisheng turned back and said softly, “There’s a family with the surname Chen living across the street. There’s a Confucian student named Chen Baozhou, who is a few years older than Li Baozhen. If you meet him, you’ll understand why only I, Li Xisheng, could inherit your fortune.” 

In truth, a meeting was unnecessary. 

As Li Xisheng spoke these words, Chen Ping'an already understood everything. 

Li Xisheng suddenly smiled, “I’m fine.” 

On Dongxian Street in North Julu, Chen—Xisheng. 

On Baoping Continent in Lihuzhu Cave Heaven, Li Baozhou. 

It had always been like this. 

This also explained why the ancestral tomb of the Chen family deep in the mountains grew a tree symbolizing the emergence of sages. 

Because this Mr. Li should have been surnamed Chen. 

Li Xisheng sighed softly, “Many things still elude my understanding, like the path of life, filled with obstacles and challenges. Only with a certain level of cultivation can one overcome them.” 

Chen Ping'an stood up and said, “Mr. Li, you should feel sad, but it doesn’t have to be that sorrowful.” 

Li Xisheng laughed, his gaze clear and bright, “That’s very comforting to hear.” 

Chen Ping'an chuckled along with him. 

Then, Li Xisheng suggested they play a game of chess. 

The two engaged in a casual game, chatting idly. 

Chen Ping'an played slowly, taking his time, only speaking a few words after each move. 

“I was quite afraid before coming to North Julu. I heard there were many sword cultivators here, acting recklessly in the mountains. I thought to come here to ease my mind, only to realize that as long as my heart is unsettled, I remain trapped in the mud.” 

“I also feared I might swing from one extreme to another, so I took on the alias Chen Haoren. It wasn’t for fun; it was a reminder to myself that during this journey, I shouldn’t act recklessly or follow the crowd.” 

“Deep down, I’ve always secretly wished to be a truly good person.” 

Li Xisheng, who spoke little, finally replied, “Recognizing one’s own selfish desires while still doing good, Chen Ping'an, do you know what that is?” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head. 

Li Xisheng picked up a chess piece and gently placed it on the board, saying, “That is what our Confucian sages strive for—‘Be cautious in solitude; restrain oneself and return to propriety.’” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, not fully agreeing. 

Li Xisheng did not press further, simply observing the game, “But your chess skills, I must say, are quite lacking.” 

Chen Ping'an admitted, “I truly have no talent for chess.” 

Li Xisheng laughed, “Is that truly the case?” 

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I lack the vision in chess, always reluctant to sacrifice a piece for the greater good.” 

Li Xisheng remarked, “Everyone plays their own game in this world, and the clever ones see others as mere chess pieces. There are many such people; you, Chen Ping'an, are not uniquely essential.” 

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Your words are quite comforting, Mr. Li.” 

Li Xisheng said, “I speak sincerely, while you flatter.” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “In our Fallen Mountain, everyone walks the world with sincerity!” 

Li Xisheng laughed and clasped his fists, “A pleasure to meet!” 

But Chen Ping'an’s smile suddenly faltered. 

Li Xisheng sighed internally. 

He must have thought of that bamboo hut in Fallen Mountain. 

In the journey of life, one is but a transient traveler. 

As the ferry traveled south from the north, it passed through the Great Zhuang Dynasty, Jinfei Country, and Lan Fang Country, eventually reaching the Symbolic Water Ferry of Spring Dew Garden. 

By now, autumn had arrived, and Chen Ping'an had missed another year’s Spring Dew Garden Farewell Spring Banquet. The Symbolic Water Ferry seemed much quieter compared to his last visit. 

The lively atmosphere of Spring Dew Garden only flourished in spring. 

Chen Ping'an stepped off the ferry. Compared to his attire when he departed last year, it was not much different; he had simply swapped his sword for a bamboo box, still clad in a blue robe, with a bamboo hat and walking stick. 

He headed straight for Old Huai Street, which bustled more than the ferry terminal. Spotting the little shop with the sign reading ‘Ant Shop,’ Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly. The two bold characters on the sign were beautifully written. He took off his hat and stepped over the threshold. The shop temporarily had no customers, which made Chen Ping'an feel a bit uneasy. 

He was greeted by the young shopkeeper, Wang Tingfang, who hailed from Zhaoyecao Hall. Upon recognizing the new owner, his smile grew even more genuine. He hurried around the counter, bowing and clasping his fists, “Wang Tingfang pays respects to the Sword Immortal, East Master.” 

As for the form of address, Wang Tingfang had pondered it for a long time, not expecting to reunite with the young sword immortal named Chen so soon. After all, mountain cultivators, once they traveled far, could easily vanish for years or even decades. 

Chen Ping'an returned the gesture, “Thank you for your hard work, Shopkeeper Wang.” 

Wang Tingfang softly asked, “Shall I fetch the account books now?” 

For a businessman, discussing business matters was always more straightforward than any pleasantries. 

Chen Ping'an nodded, and they walked over to the counter. Chen Ping'an set down his bamboo box and hat on the walking stick. 

Wang Tingfang took out two ledgers, and upon seeing this, Chen Ping'an felt a small worry evaporate. If business were truly poor, how could they keep two ledgers? 

Chen Ping'an had already examined the various treasures on the shelves inside the shop and understood the situation. He started reconciling the accounts and was surprised to see a high price listed for a pair of magical crowns. 

Glancing at the date of sale, Chen Ping'an’s expression turned strange as he asked, “Was it a young woman from Wuling Country with a regional accent? She was accompanied by a sword-wielding attendant?” 

Wang Tingfang was astonished, “How did the East Master figure this out?” 

Chen Ping'an felt a bit helpless. Not revealing the identities of Sui Jingcheng and the Yuanying sword cultivator Rong Chang, he shook his head and sighed, “Truly someone who doesn’t treat money as money; they should have sold it for more.” 

Wang Tingfang appeared flustered. 

Chen Ping'an leaned on the counter, slowly flipping through the account book, smiling, “This sale, Shopkeeper Wang, you’ve done excellently. I’m just somewhat familiar with the buyer, so I was merely guessing. If it were me selling in the shop, I could never match the price you achieved.” 

As he meticulously reviewed the accounts, he chatted with Wang Tingfang about the recent happenings in Spring Dew Garden and the business of Zhaoyecao Hall. 

Wang Tingfang smiled, “It was just a fortunate coincidence, relying on the East Master’s great reputation, that we managed to sell the golden crowns, which made last year's business look good. It had little to do with me. I dare to request the East Master not to reveal the truth to my master, or I will have to pack up and leave the Ant Shop. My master is very concerned about the business here, reviewing every season's profit and loss personally and often calling me in to ask.” 

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I brought some small Xuanbi tea cakes from the Caijue Mansion and will personally visit Master Tang to express my gratitude. The shop's business has exceeded my expectations. If the East Master is not worried that I might overstep my bounds with Master Tang, I will certainly say a few good words for you.” 

Wang Tingfang stepped back two paces, bowing in thanks, “The Sword Immortal’s kindness is like a mountain. I can only strive harder to help the Ant Shop earn more.” 

Chen Ping'an closed the account book, deciding not to review the second ledger. Since Wang Tingfang mentioned that Zhaoyecao Hall would audit it, following the principle of reciprocity, continuing to scrutinize would only embarrass him and Wang Tingfang. 

He gently pushed both ledgers towards Wang Tingfang, smiling, “The accounts are in order. Remember to keep them clear. I have no concerns. Also, Shopkeeper Wang, when conducting business in the future, just ensure a steady flow. There's no need to overly stress about the shop’s profits each year; I will likely be a hands-off master for many years after I leave Spring Dew Garden, so I’ll rely on you to take care of things.” 

Wang Tingfang nodded in agreement, carefully storing the ledgers in a drawer. 

Chen Ping'an turned to his bamboo box and took out two items: a jade bracelet with “Water in Fire” aura inscribed with a couplet, and an ancient bronze mirror, undoubtedly an evil-repelling mirror, with the valuable inscription “Built by the Palace Family.” Together with the Tree Tumor Pot and Abstinence Plate, these four items were given by Master Huang. Upon reflecting on that treasure-seeking journey, parting ways with Master Huang was definitely not a happy occasion, but parting amicably was true. 

While the Tree Tumor Pot itself was not of high quality, the old master Huan Yun recognized its potential, stating that this old relic could help Qi practitioners absorb the spiritual energy of wood-type treasures. For Chen Ping'an, who was about to refine his third wood-type fate object, it was exactly the item he needed, which he had refined into a crucial assistive treasure for the Wood Residence using the refining method of Fire Dragon Master during his journey south. 

As for the Abstinence Plate, Chen Ping'an planned to refine it into the Wood Residence as well. However, refining took too much time; balancing six hours of refining the Qingzheng Water on a daily basis while managing to refine the Tree Tumor Pot was already a mark of diligence for him. During several ferry rides, he had spent his idle time refining these objects. 

Chen Ping'an placed the jade bracelet and ancient mirror on the table, roughly explaining their origins. He smiled, “Since you’ve sold off the two golden crowns, the Ant Shop has lost its signature treasure. You can take these two to make up for it. However, these items are not for sale; you can offer a sky-high price for them, as they’re only meant to attract earth immortals.” 

Wang Tingfang nodded with a smile, fully agreeing. He carefully put away the two items, saying, “Then I will purchase two of the finest wooden boxes from Spring Dew Garden; otherwise, it would be unworthy of these treasures.” 

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Such expenses, in the future, Shopkeeper Wang need not mention to me. I trust Zhaoyecao Hall's business acumen, as well as your character.” 

Wang Tingfang bowed again in gratitude. 

After leaving the Ant Shop, Chen Ping'an went to see the young assistant who helped carve forty-eight jade Yingya stones. The assistant was tearfully grateful. Chen Ping'an did not say much, just chatted with him for a moment before heading to the old locust tree, standing there for a long while. Afterward, he sailed the talisman boat gifted by Huan Yun, visiting Master Tang, the old matriarch who was the mentor of Song Lanqiao, the ferry steward of Spring Dew Garden. His gifts were the small Xuanbi tea cakes given by Master Wu Qian of the Caijue Mansion. 

The old matriarch was especially delighted, as her disciple Song Lanqiao had risen in status at Spring Dew Garden, all thanks to this young outsider sword immortal. The young man’s two visits had brought her great honor; the previous time, she did not return the favor, but this time she still didn’t, not out of stinginess but because that young sword immortal, who always regarded others as juniors, cleverly said, “Things shouldn’t happen more than three times,” which made the old matriarch laugh heartily as she personally saw him off to the foot of the mountain. After returning to the mountain, the old matriarch, who held a chair in the ancestor hall of Spring Dew Garden, decided to not only increase her visits to Zhaoyecao Hall, which had previously had a lukewarm relationship with her but also instructed her disciple Song Lanqiao to take more care of the Ant Shop’s business from now on, without hiding or worrying about any signs of favoritism. After all, a master and disciple pair of two Golden Core cultivators were not to be trifled with. 

At Taihui Sword Sect, on the elegant peak, it was supposed to send a jar of Xuanbi tea, fulfilling a promise. However, Chen Ping'an didn’t dare to fuel the fire. Xu Xingjiu’s sincere visit earlier had left Qi Jinglong drinking to his fill, only to drink tea after that? Chen Ping'an felt guilty and decided to send it to Qi Jinglong from Spring Dew Garden. He wouldn’t refuse but would accept it. 

Previously, when visiting Zhaoyecao Hall, Master Tang's daughter, Tang Qingqing, was not on the mountain, having gone to the Great Guan Dynasty's Iron Armor Mansion to meet her love. From Master Tang's tone, the two were about to tie the knot and become a couple in the mountains. After that, Spring Dew Garden and Zhaoyecao Hall would become in-laws. Master Tang invited Chen Ping'an to the wedding banquet, but he politely declined, and Master Tang did not insist. 

Chen Ping'an did not have any fondness for the Iron Armor Mansion. In fact, he had a deadly grudge against them, having personally killed a soldier of the Liao family from the battlefield on the ferry. However, the Wei family of the Iron Armor Mansion neither sought vengeance nor acted disrespectfully; instead, they showed great deference. Chen Ping'an understood their restraint, so both sides tried to maintain a water-tight relationship. As for the saying “No fight, no friendship,” they let it go. 

With Liu Zhimo of the Book Letter Lake, they had drunk together several times and even became short-lived allies, doing business together. This was the complexity of worldly affairs—one must adapt even if it is difficult. 

Reuniting with He Xiaoliang on the shores of the West Sea of North Julu, amidst their seemingly light-hearted chat, Chen Ping'an remarked that if the Mountain Ape of Zhengyang Mountain had asked him to kneel, Liu Xianyang could have avoided calamity. Chen Ping'an, not to mention kneeling, could even bloom a flower while doing so. 

It was in this vein, not merely jesting. 

However, later on, Liu Zhimo broke through to the upper fifth realm, yet Fallen Mountain still did not send congratulations. 

In the path of life, bowing to others can be of two types: one is forced by circumstances, and the other is a relentless pursuit of maximizing benefits. 

The former leaves one feeling melancholic, while the latter can bring joy. 

Chen Ping'an boarded the talisman boat, heading towards the Yuying Cliff, a place that used to be where the Golden Crow Palace’s Liu Zhiqing brewed tea, now belonging to him just like the Ant Shop. 

But upon arriving at the pavilion in Yuying Cliff, he found a familiar figure standing there: the owner of Spring Dew Garden, the Yuanying ancestor, Tan Ling. 

Chen Ping'an docked the talisman boat and hurriedly walked towards the pavilion. 

Tan Ling descended the steps of the pavilion and smiled, “Upon learning that Sword Immortal Chen had graced Spring Dew Garden with your presence, I happened to be free, so I came uninvited.” 

Entering the pavilion together and sitting opposite each other, Chen Ping'an smiled, “You are overly courteous, Mrs. Tan.” 

Tan Ling smiled as she handed over a newly published collection from the end of last winter, saying, “This is the latest ‘Winter Dew and Spring Dwell,’ which received great feedback regarding your and Liu Sword Immortal's discussion over tea at Yuying Cliff.” 

Chen Ping'an accepted the booklet, flipping to his piece, the wording beautiful and the content appropriate. He planned to show it to his first disciple later. 

He tucked it away in his sleeve, gazing at the jade-like cliff and deep stream, softly saying, “Having missed the Farewell Spring Banquet twice is truly regrettable. After this parting, I do not know when I can return to Spring Dew Garden again.” 

Tan Ling found it strange why this young sword immortal regarded Spring Dew Garden with such admiration. 

During their previous meeting, she had been polite but somewhat distant, as there was no need for extra business for her and Spring Dew Garden; stability was sufficient. 

However, not long after this young sword immortal left Spring Dew Garden, there were reports of Liu Jinglong from Taihui Sword Sect ascending to the peak alongside a certain sword immortal, performing a grand ceremony with their swords. That golden sword light shot up into the clouds, breaking through the night, linking back to the earlier incident of the Golden Crow Palace splitting the thunderclouds. Tan Ling began to form some conjectures. 

A sword cultivator familiar with Liu Zhiqing, the little master of the Golden Crow Palace, could be met with a few words. 

But having a close relationship with the Golden Core sword cultivator Liu Zhiqing, and being qualified to journey and perform a sword ceremony with a sword immortal already in the Jade Pulp realm—if Tan Ling did not want to lose face entirely, she should have personally awaited him outside the Ant Shop on Old Huai Street. 

It was not that Tan Ling was unwilling to let go of her pride; rather, she feared that if she appeared twice, her stance would seem too stiff, which might lead this young sword immortal to look down on her and the entire Spring Dew Garden. 

Inside the pavilion, their conversation remained cordial. 

Yet the young sword immortal's previous words had already made Tan Ling feel that this trip was worthwhile. 

After a short exchange, Tan Ling stood up to take her leave. Chen Ping'an accompanied her to the steps of the pavilion, watching the Yuanying female cultivator leave gracefully on the wind. 

Chen Ping'an wrote three secret letters and visited the sword room at Spring Dew Garden, sending them respectively to Taihui Sword Sect, Yunsang City, and the Golden Crow Palace. 

In addition to sending a letter to Qi Jinglong, there was of course the small Xuanbi tea cake. 

The letter discussed the imitation swords from Hate Sword Mountain and the purchase of treasures from the Three Young Masters Temple, along with one hundred Gu Yu coins, instructing Qi Jinglong to secure three sword challenges. He should handle it as he saw fit, ensuring the purchase of one imitation sword and one treasure from the Three Young Masters Temple. If that wasn’t enough, he could advance the payment, and if there was any surplus, he could buy more imitation swords from Hate Sword Mountain and select extra treasures from the Three Young Masters Temple. The letter was straightforward, urging Qi Jinglong to display the demeanor of an upper fifth realm sword immortal when negotiating. If the other party was unreasonable, he should not hesitate to repeat “I am from Taihui Sword Sect” and “I am Liu Jinglong” as many times as necessary. 

At the end of the letter, he wished Qi Jinglong smooth sailing in his three sword challenges against Li Cai, Dong Zhu, and Bai Chang. 

The letter sent to Xu Xingjiu in Yunsang City mentioned that he had met that “Mr. Liu.” The last drinking session hadn’t felt complete, primarily due to the upcoming three battles requiring him to focus. However, Mr. Liu held Xu Xingjiu’s wine-making skills in high regard. Therefore, once Mr. Liu successfully completed his three sword challenges, Xu Xingjiu should not hesitate to visit Taihui Sword Sect again, as Mr. Liu might be more open to drinking this time. He also asked Xu Xingjiu to send a message to a boy named Bai Shou, suggesting that when Bai Shou descends from the mountain to travel, he should visit Fallen Mountain. At the end of the letter, he informed Xu Xingjiu that if there was a reply, it could be sent to Bone Marsh under the Pima Sect, addressed to the disciple of the Wooden Garment Mountain’s ancestral hall, Pang Lanxi, for forwarding to Chen Haoren. 

The final letter was sent to the Golden Crow Palace’s Rong Casting Peak, addressed to the former owner of Yuying Cliff, Liu Zhiqing. 

The letter was brief, containing only two sentences: “Cultivating the heart is not easy; let us encourage each other.” 

“I will certainly request a prized piece of the Divine Lady's painting from Master Pang when I return to Bone Marsh.” 

Returning to Yuying Cliff, Chen Ping'an sat alone in the pavilion, contemplating for a long time. 

The ferry traveling back and forth between Spring Dew Garden and Bone Marsh would take another two days to reach Symbolic Water Ferry. 

It seemed like there was a mountain of tasks to tackle, yet it also felt like there was nothing to do. 

Chen Ping'an left the pavilion, rolled up his sleeves and pant legs, and went to the creek below the deep pool to gather stones. 

Song Lanqiao, the Golden Core elder of Spring Dew Garden, felt somewhat anxious. 

Since embarking on the return journey from Bone Marsh, a rather frightening passenger had boarded their ferry. 

It was a young man in white, graceful and poised, headed for Spring Dew Garden. 

Previously, at the juncture between Bone Marsh and Ghost Valley, there had been a tremendous disturbance, causing great upheaval. Due to the suddenness of the event and its swift conclusion, Song Lanqiao did not witness it firsthand. However, cultivators with status on the mountain were adept at gathering intelligence and piecing together clues. After the handsome young man wielding a green bamboo staff boarded the ferry, Song Lanqiao’s first instinct was to urgently send a message via flying sword to Spring Dew Garden, warning them to be cautious, as this person had a peculiar temperament. Upon arriving at Bone Marsh, his first act was to tear through the sky above Ghost Valley, bombarding the head of Gao Cheng, the Jade Pulp realm spirit residing in Jingguan City, with treasures! 

Gao Cheng, stationed in Jingguan City, was equivalent to a celestial level of cultivation, yet he had not pursued this “young man” who had disrupted his territory. 

If Spring Dew Garden faced an unexpected disaster, what could they do? 

During the ferry ride to Spring Dew Garden, the young man in white slipped off the boat to explore the riverside terrain near Cangjun Lake. However, he quickly caught up with the ferry, returning stealthily at night. If not for Song Lanqiao being constantly on edge and watching his ferry, it would be unimaginable that this person could infiltrate a ferry with the secret restrictions of Spring Dew Garden as if it were unguarded. 

Song Lanqiao was increasingly terrified. 

Meanwhile, the young man seemed quite relaxed, often leaving his room, wandering casually on the deck of the ferry. 

As they neared Spring Dew Garden, the handsome young man with the red birthmark on his forehead grew a bit impatient, seemingly displeased with the ferry's slow pace. However, for some unknown reason, he stubbornly remained on the ship instead of soaring off into the sky. 

One day, the young man proactively approached Song Lanqiao, knocking on his door and straightforwardly asking, “How is the business of that Ant Shop on Old Huai Street?” 

Previously, Song Lanqiao had not noticed the young man’s arrival. He cautiously asked, “Are you a… friend of that Sword Immortal Chen?” 

The young man’s eyes widened, filled with rage, “What nonsense! How could we possibly be friends?!” 

Song Lanqiao’s expression shifted slightly, his heart racing. Did this person have a vendetta against the young sword immortal? Would Spring Dew Garden get dragged into this? What should he do? 

The young man sneered, “What? You know him?” 

Song Lanqiao, torn between panic and consideration, ultimately gritted his teeth and said, “I do indeed know Sword Immortal Chen quite well. He took the ferry for his first visit to Spring Dew Garden.” 

Unexpectedly, the young man slapped Song Lanqiao’s shoulder hard, beaming, “Good lad, your path has widened!” 

Song Lanqiao staggered back from the force of the slap, momentarily bewildered. 

The young man maintained his smile and invited Song Lanqiao to sit down for tea. Song Lanqiao, feeling uneasy, took a seat and accepted the teacup, his heart racing. 

Unconsciously, Song Lanqiao forgot this was actually his territory. 

The young man did not drink tea, simply placing his green bamboo staff on the table beside him, folding his hands over it with a smile, “Since you’re an acquaintance of my master, you’re a friend of mine, Cui Dongshan.” 

Song Lanqiao was even more perplexed; there were not many upper fifth realm cultivators on Baoping Continent. 

Among the upper fifth realm cultivators, there was no one named Cui Dongshan. There was, however, a prominent figure named Cui Zhan, the national teacher of the Great Li Dynasty, a name well-known among the mountain cultivators of North Julu. 

How could this “young man” claim to be a student of that young sword immortal? 

It wasn’t that Song Lanqiao looked down on the young sword immortal; it was just that this was simply unreasonable. 

Cui Dongshan smiled, “My master is quite sentimental. Before returning to Wooden Garment Mountain, he will definitely pay a visit to your Spring Dew Garden.” 

This was primarily because there was an old locust tree nearby. 

Cui Dongshan was thus quite certain. 

Song Lanqiao could not help but ask, “Is Sword Immortal Chen your master?” 

Cui Dongshan shot him a sidelong glance, “Envious? Do you think you can be envious?” My master chooses his disciples carefully, and they are rarer than precious gems.” 

Song Lanqiao was nearly driven to the brink. 

What kind of nonsense was this? 

That young sword immortal, who had developed a connection with Spring Dew Garden, was polite and considerate, while this peculiar student had such an odd temperament? 

Cui Dongshan suddenly grinned, “Lanqiao, do you not believe I am my master’s student, or do you not believe my master has such a student?” 

Song Lanqiao was left speechless. 

Cui Dongshan stood up, grasping his staff, “Then I shall take my leave first, to see if my master is at Spring Dew Garden now. You can rest easy.” 

Feeling that saying anything would be futile, Song Lanqiao decided to remain silent, quietly seeing this senior off as he left. 

The handsome young man in white with the green bamboo staff stepped over the threshold, striding down the corridor, waving his hand, “No need to see me off.” 

Song Lanqiao stood there, dumbfounded and drenched in sweat, completely oblivious. 

Cui Dongshan reached the bow of the boat and leaped up, causing the entire ferry to drop several tens of zhang, as he transformed into a rainbow, departing in a flash, his snowy white figure leaving a thunderous impression. 

Chen Ping'an was bent over at the creek, carefully selecting stones, placing them in the folds of his blue robe, and shielding them with one hand. He suddenly stood up and turned around. 

He saw Cui Dongshan. 

Chen Ping'an was taken aback for a long moment before asking, “Did Senior Cui leave?” 

Cui Dongshan nodded, looking down. 

Chen Ping'an said, “I’m fine. How about you?” 

Cui Dongshan raised his head, “Not so good.” 

Chen Ping'an let the pebbles slip from his hand into the creek and walked towards the shore, realizing that he was now half a head taller than his student. 

Chen Ping'an placed his hand on Cui Dongshan’s shoulder, saying, “Then let’s go home together.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 668: Teacher and Student Amidst Mountains and Waters

The atmosphere around the Spring Dew Courtyard’s Patriarch Hall was somewhat peculiar. A few elderly figures, who usually led secluded lives, were visibly burdened with heavy hearts. Among them were several disciples and guest elders who practiced within the Spring Dew Courtyard.

However, there were also those who were more intrigued than troubled. For example, Tang Xi, the owner of the Night-Blooming Grass Hall and the mentor of the ferrying alchemist Song Lanqiao, exchanged a brief glance with an elderly woman who often maintained a distant relationship with him. They both nodded slightly, a hint of veiled amusement in their eyes.

Then, there was Tan Ling, who sat in the main seat, his expression complicated.

Song Lanqiao had sent two successive messages via flying swords to the Patriarch Hall. The first message was a cryptic warning about an inscrutable outsider—a young man in white who possessed an ethereal appearance. This young man had arrived at the Bone Marsh aboard a ferry from the Pima Sect, unleashing a storm of magical artifacts upon Jingguan City. Both Gao Cheng and the Ghost Valley seemed to regard this individual with considerable caution, remaining silent in response to his presence. The second message claimed that this person identified himself as a disciple of a young sword immortal and referred to a certain young man with the surname Chen as "teacher." His temperament was odd and difficult to gauge, and Song Lanqiao felt utterly powerless in a potential confrontation with him.

Tan Ling passed the two messages around for everyone to read. Once they had returned to him, he gently tucked them away into his sleeves and addressed the assembly: “I have personally sent a flying sword message to Mu Yi Mountain of the Pima Sect to inquire about this individual, but I have yet to receive a reply. Everyone, what strategies do you propose for the Spring Dew Courtyard? We cannot solely rely on the Pima Sect, as it is clear that this person has a favorable relationship with Mu Yi Mountain. Furthermore, I suspect that Mr. Chen is the sword cultivator who participated in the sword offering ceremony alongside Liu Jianxian of the Taihui Sword Sect last year in the territory of the Fuqu Kingdom.”

The Patriarch Hall fell into a silence so profound that a falling needle could be heard.

The Spring Dew Courtyard was regarded as one of the top-tier forces in the Northern Julu Continent, comparable to the Thunder God’s Abode on Infant Mountain and Lion Peak, boasting a solid reputation and extensive connections. However, they were just one step away from establishing themselves as a true sect, lacking only a pillar-level Yu Pu Realm elder. The awkward predicament for the Spring Dew Courtyard lay in Tan Ling’s inability to break through the Nascent Soul bottleneck in his lifetime, rendering his hopes of reaching the fifth realm unattainable.

Now, facing this pair of teacher and student, he felt utterly flustered.

Tan Ling inquired further, “Tang Xi, what do you think of Mr. Chen’s character?”

This title made Tan Ling’s expression slightly unnatural.

Seated closest to the entrance of the Patriarch Hall, Tang Xi gently caressed the armrest of his chair, carefully choosing his words before responding, “As for his cultivation level, it remains unclear. His identity and background are shrouded in mystery. However, in terms of business dealings, Mr. Chen values fairness.”

This marked the first time Tan Ling had earnestly sought Tang Xi’s opinion during a discussion in the Patriarch Hall.

The elderly woman smiled gently, “Young Master Chen is quite polite and adheres to the principle of reciprocity; he’s a very well-mannered young man. You may not be familiar with him, but I, for one, hold him in high regard. He has visited me twice and gifted me a magical artifact and some exquisite tea cakes. Now, I’m worried about what I should prepare for his next visit. I can’t let him come three times bearing gifts while I have nothing to offer in return. After all, he himself said, ‘No more than three visits without a return gift,’ but alas, my resources are limited. I fear that a meager return gift may embarrass the Spring Dew Courtyard.”

The elderly woman’s words were layered with meaning, hinting at more than just hospitality.

Tan Ling smiled slightly, “Sister Lin need not worry about this. You can select a suitable gift from the offerings of the Spring Dew Courtyard’s Patriarch Hall today.”

The elderly woman feigned surprise, “Sister Tan, isn’t this asking us to overspend? That wouldn’t be appropriate, would it? This old woman could sell some of her possessions and borrow some funds from that useless disciple, Song Lanqiao, to scrape together a magical artifact.”

Tan Ling maintained her calm demeanor and smiled, “There’s no need to trouble Song Lanqiao. He has worked diligently over the years managing the ferry business for the Spring Dew Courtyard, which is no small feat.”

The elderly woman pretended to suddenly remember, “Sister Tan, you are indeed a Nascent Soul great practitioner, and your memory surpasses that of this unaccomplished Golden Core disciple. I almost forgot that I have Song Lanqiao, who has been tirelessly traveling outside for many years.”

The old foxes within the Patriarch Hall became increasingly alert, sensing that the elderly woman intended to draw her disciple into the fold of the Patriarch Hall.

This was no trivial matter.

“Let’s not speak of my overworked disciple; this child is simply not destined for a life of ease.”

Unexpectedly, the elderly woman swiftly changed the topic, completely avoiding the matter of adding seats to the Patriarch Hall. She turned her gaze toward Tang Xi and said slowly, “Our Tang worshipper has had a harder time than Song Lanqiao. Not only does he work hard, but he also has great merits. Why does he still sit in the position closest to the door? Half of the Spring Dew Courtyard's business comes from the Night-Blooming Grass Hall. If I remember correctly, the chairs in the Patriarch Hall were crafted with the financial and labor contributions of the Night-Blooming Grass Hall. We, the older generation enjoying a stable life, ought to have a bit of conscience. In my opinion, it would be better if I exchanged seats with Tang Xi. I can sit by the entrance, sparing Sister Tan and everyone else the discomfort.”

Tang Xi immediately stood up, clasped his hands in a bow, and said solemnly, “Absolutely not. I am a businessman. My talent for cultivation is mediocre at best, and while my business may be considerable, it is only possible thanks to the Spring Dew Courtyard. I am fully aware of my own capabilities. To be able to participate in discussions within the Patriarch Hall with all of you is already taking advantage of heaven’s blessings for my own gain. How could I dare to harbor any improper thoughts?”

The elderly woman babbled on, “You only have one daughter, who is about to marry. Your future in-laws are the Wei family from the Iron Armor Department of the Great View Dynasty, not to mention His Majesty the Emperor doesn’t regard your position in the Spring Dew Courtyard as merely a doorkeeper. Those idle rumors should not trouble you; you, Tang Xi, have a broad mind and great tolerance, but I, an outsider, feel uncomfortable listening to them. I have no gifts to offer, so I can only exchange seats with you to show my modest gratitude.”

In truth, while the Spring Dew Courtyard had an elder managing its finances, Tang Xi was considered the recognized financial deity of the Spring Dew Courtyard. Compared to the former’s reputation, Tang Xi evidently commanded more respect within and outside the Spring Dew Courtyard.

The elderly woman referred to him as “Tang Xi” repeatedly, which was not disrespectful but rather an indication of her closeness.

An elder responsible for the Patriarch Hall’s treasury, with a sullen expression, scoffed, “Are we not discussing a countermeasure? How did we end up talking about Tang Xi’s daughter’s marriage? If, from now on, this strictly governed Patriarch Hall can slide around like a watermelon peel, shall we also discuss the shadowy tea from the Bone Marsh? Is it good? Should we prepare a few pounds for our next meeting, sipping tea while casually discussing trivial matters for seven or eight hours?”

The elderly woman smiled, “In the presence of the esteemed Senior Gao, Tang Xi’s daughter’s marriage and the Spring Dew Courtyard’s connection with the Great View Dynasty’s Emperor are certainly trivial matters.”

The elder in charge of finances slammed his hand down on the armrest of his chair and angrily retorted, “Lin, stop trying to confuse the issue! Your petty schemes are making a racket. Do you really think the rest of us are blind and deaf?!”

The elderly woman let out a playful snort, mocking, “Oh, so it’s not, is it?”

Tang Xi offered a faint smile, starting to feel the need to diffuse the tension. This new ally of his seemed a bit too hasty. If he added fuel to the fire now, it would only lead to a worse situation; it was better to watch and see.

Tan Ling gently waved his hand, “These are certainly not trivial matters. Once we resolve the pressing issue at hand, we will discuss it, and that will be today. First, we need to ascertain the departure dates of the two parties. Secondly, during this period, how can we smoothly resolve these troublesome matters? As for whether we can establish this connection, I, Tan Ling, and the Spring Dew Courtyard do not expect or demand it. Finally, let’s consider who will take the lead. Everyone, please discuss and propose a candidate, be it Song Lanqiao or someone else. I want to make it clear in advance that regardless of the outcome, whether good or bad, the Spring Dew Courtyard should give credit to this person. If the results do not meet expectations and anyone dares to bring up past matters or make sarcastic comments, don’t blame me for invoking the family law.”

At this point, Tan Ling smiled, “If you feel that it is necessary for me to personally negotiate, as long as it is the outcome discussed in the Patriarch Hall, I, Tan Ling, will take full responsibility. If I fail to handle it well and there are grievances, feel free to criticize me in front of the Patriarch Hall. As the head of a mountain, I will certainly accept it.”

After a short incense stick burned down, Tang Xi was the first to leave the Patriarch Hall.

The rest of the individuals in the Patriarch Hall remained silent, awaiting news.

The elderly woman chuckled softly, “Whoever does the work bears the brunt, clear as day.”

Her words made Tan Ling frown.

An elder, brimming with anger, barked, “Lin Chao, care to repeat that?!”

The elderly woman retorted, “Hard of hearing, are we?”

Tan Ling’s voice turned stern, “Gao Song, Lin Chao, both of you, be quiet!”

The elder and the elderly woman, one furious and the other amused, ultimately ceased their verbal sparring.

Tan Ling sighed inwardly; the enmity and affection between these two, who had nearly become immortal companions, were tangled and inextricable.

Suddenly, a guest elder from the Spring Dew Courtyard spoke up, “Tan Mountain Master, should we use the power of the Viewing Mountains and Rivers to check for signs over at Jade Reflection Cliff? If Tang Xi’s efforts backfire, we can prepare in advance.”

The elderly woman smiled and responded, “Those who are hard of hearing have appeared, and now the blind have come as well.”

Both Tan Ling and the guest elder ignored Lin Chao’s sarcastic remark, with Tan Ling shaking his head, “This is not advisable. The other party is at least an old Nascent Soul practitioner, and they could very likely be a Yu Pu Realm senior. While a Nascent Soul practitioner is manageable, if they are truly at the Yu Pu Realm, they will undoubtedly catch on to any signs, putting Tang Xi in a precarious position at Jade Reflection Cliff.”

Lin Chao retorted sarcastically, “Isn’t Tang Xi just an outsider to the Spring Dew Courtyard? There are plenty of people here who covet his assets. If he meets an untimely end, using his wealth to defuse the situation with Mr. Chen and his student might even turn out to be profitable for the Spring Dew Courtyard.”

The guest elder could only smile wryly.

Tan Ling was furious, standing up and glaring at the elderly woman, whose words had been sharp as knives all day, “Lin Chao! Do you still want to help Song Lanqiao secure a place in the Patriarch Hall?!”

The elderly woman chuckled, “No need to say more. It’s not often that I get a chance to speak, and today, with the sun oddly rising from the west, I couldn’t help but say a bit more. As long as my disciple can enter the Patriarch Hall, even if Song Lanqiao has to sit by the threshold with a small stool, acting as a door god, I, Lin Chao, can guarantee that I will continue to keep quiet as I did before.”

After saying this, the elderly woman gazed out the door of the Patriarch Hall.

Tan Ling had initially wanted to scold her to prevent her from becoming more demanding in the future, but seeing the elderly woman’s withered face, he felt an unexpected twinge of pity.

Moreover, the Patriarch Hall of the Spring Dew Courtyard ought to have a few individuals willing to genuinely contribute.

With Tang Xi from the Night-Blooming Grass Hall, Song Lanqiao, who had managed the ferry business for many years, and Lin Chao, who had made a promise today, the alliance of these three could represent a new force in the Spring Dew Courtyard, and Tan Ling felt it might not all be a bad thing.

Tang Xi did not soar away on the winds; instead, he boarded a Spring Dew Courtyard talisman boat and made his way to Jade Reflection Cliff.

Before putting away the talisman boat, he spotted a young sword immortal in a blue robe, who, together with the young man in white, was casually picking stones from the stream—a scene of serene leisure.

Chen Ping’an had heard that Song Lanqiao’s ferry would arrive at the Symbol Water Crossing tomorrow, so he and Cui Dongshan waited by the stream, picking stones and chatting about the experiences of this intercontinental journey.

When the conversation turned to the Bone Marsh and Jingguan City, Chen Ping’an asked, “With Pima Sect’s master Zhu Quan stationed in that town, would it be possible for Gao Cheng, given his cultivation level and the military strength of Jingguan City and its vassals, to eliminate this thorn in one fell swoop?”

Cui Dongshan responded without hesitation, “It’s quite simple. If Zhu Quan wishes to survive, he can certainly slip away back to Mu Yi Mountain. However, knowing his temperament, he is likely to fight to the death within Ghost Valley, risking his life to ensure that Jingguan City suffers substantial losses, thus allowing the next generation of Mu Yi Mountain to grow up, such as Du Wensi, who has been stuck at the Golden Core bottleneck for many years, and the direct disciple of the Patriarch Hall, the young Pang Lanxi.”

Yet, Cui Dongshan added, Gao Cheng seemed to regard Zhu Quan with a measure of respect, which was why he was hesitant to break relations outright.

Chen Ping’an chuckled and asked, “How long have you been at Bone Marsh to know this much?”

Cui Dongshan grinned, “Having keen insights from small details is one of my few talents.”

Then, in a lowered voice, he added, “I’ve gathered quite a bit of information about Gao Cheng’s roots during my travels across the Northern Julu Continent. With the assistance of the Pima Sect, I now have Gao Cheng’s exact birth date, hometown, and even the feng shui of his ancestral grave. These were all inconsequential details, and if they were in the hands of any immortal cultivator in Northern Julu, they wouldn’t pose any challenge to Jingguan City. In the worst case, it would merely be a nuisance. Unfortunately for Gao Cheng, he crossed paths with me, and it has become quite significant.”

Chen Ping’an picked up a snow-white pebble and tucked it into the folds of his blue robe, saying, “What Gao Cheng did to Zhou Mili is truly despicable.”

Cui Dongshan nodded vigorously, “It’s inhumane.”

Cui Dongshan then added, “Gao Cheng is not a human anyway.”

Chen Ping’an shot him a sidelong glance.

Cui Dongshan blinked innocently, “Brother Gao now has a little brother, but unfortunately, I didn’t bring him along on this Northern journey. In the future, if you have the opportunity, you might want to meet this younger brother of Gao. He’s quite handsome, but he’s a bit slow on the uptake, not very bright.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Is he similar to the young attendant next to Mr. Li?”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “One is for practice, while the other is meticulously crafted. They are somewhat different.”

Chen Ping’an hesitated for a moment but still said, “If possible, it would be best for us to treat them as people someday. But for now, you should make your own judgments based on the circumstances; I’m just expressing my thoughts, not demanding how you should act.”

Cui Dongshan’s eyes sparkled with youthful exuberance as he grinned, “Since you say it’s possible, why would I disagree?”

The two of them soon noticed Tang Xi and the talisman boat and fell silent.

Tang Xi approached the stream, performed a respectful bow, and said, “Tang Xi of the Night-Blooming Grass Hall pays his respects to Mr. Chen.”

Chen Ping’an, clutching a pouch of pebbles in one hand, walked ashore and greeted Tang Xi with a smile.

Behind him, Cui Dongshan struggled with an even larger and heavier pouch of pebbles, which looked somewhat comical as he used both hands to hold it.

Chen Ping’an and Tang Xi walked side by side, with Tang Xi directly stating, “Mr. Chen, there are some concerns on the side of the Spring Dew Courtyard, so I dared to trespass upon your tranquility.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Tang Xi, please reassure Madam Tan. My disciple and I will soon board Senior Song’s ferry to head to the Bone Marsh. Rest assured, we will not bring any trouble to the Spring Dew Courtyard; otherwise, it would be too ungrateful. From Jade Reflection Cliff to Old Huai Street’s Ant Shop, and then to you, Tang Xi, and Elder Lin, we have received too many favors from the Spring Dew Courtyard. Once we reach the Pima Sect’s Mu Yi Mountain, I will make an effort to speak well of the Spring Dew Courtyard to our acquaintances there, hoping that the existing relationships between the Pima Sect and the Spring Dew Courtyard can develop further. However, I am but a small figure, and my words may not carry much weight. If my assurances fall flat at Mu Yi Mountain, I hope to visit the Spring Dew Courtyard again in the future, and I trust that the doors of Tang Xi’s Night-Blooming Grass Hall will remain open to me so that I can share a cup of tea.”

Tang Xi visibly relaxed, feeling a sincere gratitude wash over him as he bowed again, “Mr. Chen’s great kindness, Tang Xi will remember it in his heart!”

Chen Ping’an replied with a smile, “At the shop, Wang Tingfang manages it quite well. Tang Xi need not worry too much; otherwise, I will feel guilty, and Wang Tingfang will inevitably feel pressured.”

Tang Xi nodded, “Since Mr. Chen has spoken, I will leave it to Wang Tingfang. However, Mr. Chen can rest assured, the Spring Dew Courtyard may be big or small, but if there is even the slightest oversight, I will certainly reprimand that kid Wang Tingfang. If one can earn money so comfortably, if he dares to slack off, it shows a lack of conscience. If that happens, the next time Mr. Chen comes to my Night-Blooming Grass Hall for tea, I will drink first, pouring three cups for myself as punishment before I dare to share tea with Mr. Chen.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and nodded.

Tang Xi acted decisively, taking his leave and stating plainly that he needed to return to the Patriarch Hall to report.

This time, he did not leisurely board the talisman boat but instead soared away on the winds.

Throughout this exchange, Cui Dongshan had remained silent.

Chen Ping’an turned to Cui Dongshan, “Having you here, I finally got to experience the feeling of borrowing someone’s power.”

Cui Dongshan responded with seriousness, “It’s only right that a teacher scolds his student.”

Chen Ping’an laughed in exasperation, “What does that even mean?”

The two of them arrived at a pavilion, where Chen Ping’an sat on the steps, and Cui Dongshan took a seat beside him, intentionally lowering himself one step.

They had already piled the pebbles they had collected together.

Cui Dongshan leaned back against the higher step behind him, gazing into the distance at the mountains and waters. Even as autumn approached, the scenery remained lush and green, though human emotions were not so uniformly vibrant across the seasons.

Chen Ping’an rolled up his sleeves and pant legs, remaining barefoot, with his shoes situated behind him on the steps, the tips of his boots pointed towards the long bench.

Cui Dongshan’s hiking staff leaned against a column of the pavilion.

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “When I was an apprentice at the dragon kiln, I would look at the soil wherever I went, assessing whether it was suitable for making pottery. Later, when I took over the Burden House, I would always think about making money and whether I could save up wealth.”

Chen Ping’an sighed, “Kneading that purple-gold clay is a monumental task. Firing porcelain is even more critical, as even if the shape and glaze look beautiful beforehand, if the firing goes wrong, it’s all for naught. A tiny mistake could lead to a complete failure, wasting the hard work of dozens of people for at least half a year. That’s why firing has always been overseen by Old Yao, and even the most favored disciple, Liu Xianyang, isn’t allowed to interfere. Old Yao would sit on a stool, watching over the kiln fire all night. Yet he often says that once the porcelain is in the kiln, whether it succeeds or fails, good or bad, it ultimately still depends on fate. In reality, most of it turns into shattered pieces of porcelain mountain. At that time, I heard that since it was for the Emperor’s use, it was better to be lacking than excessive. Just a hint of imperfection warranted complete destruction. Back then, I truly felt the weight of that old saying, 'The sky is high, and the Emperor is far away.'”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “But back then, I thought the top of the old locust tree was very high, and so was the peak of the old porcelain mountain. As for how far, chopping wood and making charcoal on the mountain felt far enough. At least it was much further than gathering herbs when I was a child.”

Cui Dongshan had been lost in thought.

Hearing this, he quietly said, “When I was locked away in the attic reading, I didn’t feel how high it was. I could only look through a small window at the distant view. At that time, I hated books most. I had a good memory and could recall everything I read. I vowed that when I sought a master, I would find someone with shallow knowledge, someone who wouldn’t interfere with me. Eventually, I found an old scholar who was starving in a shabby alley. Initially, I didn’t think much of his knowledge, but later, I discovered that this randomly chosen master actually had quite a bit of wisdom. Later on, I traveled around with this old scholar, who hadn’t yet made a name for himself, and I was turned away from many doors and met many true scholars. When the old scholar finally said he wanted to return to compile a book, I realized that I had traveled quite a distance.”

The old scholar had been quite adamant, claiming that if this book were published, it would sell at least a thousand copies! It would certainly reach other states. As he proclaimed this, the old scholar’s voice was loud, and I could tell he was feeling insecure.

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “She chose me because of Mr. Qi. In the beginning, my relationship with Chen Ping’an was almost non-existent. You begged me shamelessly to be your teacher, which was also the old gentleman pushing you to take me as your master. The initial connection between us was minimal.”

Cui Dongshan was about to speak.

Chen Ping’an waved his hand and continued, “But even if the connection was minimal, it was still a connection, because at a certain moment, I happened to be that ‘one’—the possibility, even if it was just a remote chance, was still the beginning of everything. I am not unfamiliar with such events, and in fact, there are even larger beginnings for me, encompassing many things. For instance, after my father passed away and my mother fell ill, I became the sole thing. If I did not do something, I would truly lose everything, end up with nothing. The door of Gu Can’s courtyard and the bowl of rice on their family table were also everything. If that door had remained closed, perhaps I could have found another way to live, but the Chen Ping’an sitting here talking with you today would no longer exist.”

As he spoke, Chen Ping’an gently clenched his fist and tapped it against his heart. “When we care deeply about this world, life can become quite difficult.”

Chen Ping’an turned his head and smiled, “But coincidentally, I fear everything except hardship. In fact, I even feel that the more I endure hardship, the more it proves my existence in this world. There’s no other way to think; otherwise, life becomes even more unbearable.”

Chen Ping’an looked towards the young man in white. “In this regard, you are not as good as I am. A disciple is not as good as a teacher. But in this matter, don’t learn from me; it’s not that it’s wrong, but rather that you don’t need to.”

Cui Dongshan nodded.

Chen Ping’an reclined back, placing his hands under his head, and whispered, “Pei Qian suddenly practicing martial arts must be because of Cao Qinglang.”

Cui Dongshan hummed in agreement.

It was Mr. Chen who had guessed that Pei Qian had begun to practice martial arts, and the reason for this was plain.

Chen Ping’an said, “When I see her, I will tell her that she can remember Cui Senior but need not feel guilty. If Pei Qian agrees but cannot do it, that’s even better. I believe she will certainly feel the same. Pei Qian, you, me, we are all alike; we understand the principles, yet we cannot overcome our heart’s hurdles. So, every time I return to my hometown after growing up, regardless of whether it’s in thought or in walking, I feel a pang in my heart. The older I get, the harder it becomes to perceive. For Pei Qian, the bamboo loft at Falling Fortune Mountain is her heart’s hurdle. The heart’s hurdle of the Nanyuan Kingdom can be crossed with Cui Senior’s help. After Cui Senior leaves, she will find it impossible to cross this new hurdle in her life. However, I believe some hurdles will remain in one’s heart for a lifetime, unable to be smoothed over, and one can only sneak around them. There’s nothing wrong with that.”

Finally, Chen Ping’an added, “What I fear most is when I feel no guilt in my heart. When I feel my conscience is at ease, when I feel entitled, thinking, ‘This is how it is.’”

Cui Dongshan turned to look, and his teacher had stopped speaking, closing his eyes as if falling asleep.

Cui Dongshan followed suit, closing his eyes and letting his thoughts drift far away.

Only the gentle sound of water flowed like a whisper, while the towering mountains stood silently, as if to say the impossible.

Cui Dongshan felt a sense of peace and gradually drifted into sleep.

Time passed, and suddenly, Cui Dongshan spoke, “Seeing Little Treasure Bottle and Pei Qian grow up, how sorrowful do you feel, teacher? Similarly, how comforted does Qi Jingchun feel seeing you grow up?”

Chen Ping’an remained silent, seemingly still deep in sleep.

Cui Dongshan remained quiet for a long while before he couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher?”

Chen Ping’an replied softly, “I am here.”

 ### Chapter 669: Returning Home (Part One)

Chen Ping'an and Cui Dongshan visited their shop on Old Huai Street.

Sitting on a small bamboo chair at the door, Chen Ping'an basked in the warm autumn sun. Cui Dongshan had sent away the temporary shopkeeper, Wang Tingfang, claiming it was time for him to take a day off. Wang Tingfang, puzzled but smiling at the young boss's cheerful demeanor, left the shop with a bemused expression.

Business that day was decent. News had spread across Old Huai Street of an exceptionally handsome young man visiting, attracting many young female cultivators. With Cui Dongshan's knack for charm, they made quite a bit of money—money that wasn’t entirely earned in good conscience, but Chen Ping'an didn’t mind.

The next day, at the Fu Shui Ferry, Tan Ling and Tang Xi appeared, along with Song Lanqiao, who was in charge of the Spring Dew Garden ferry. 

After exchanging pleasantries, Chen Ping'an and Cui Dongshan boarded the boat, with Song Lanqiao following closely. The seasoned Golden Elixir practitioner noticed something peculiar: whenever he saw the young Sword Immortal and the white-clad youth together, he struggled to link them as teacher and student. It was unimaginable to him. However, the moment they walked side by side, there was an inexplicable harmony between them. Could it be because both carried green bamboo walking sticks?

Song Lanqiao chose not to delve further into the matter but expressed his gratitude sincerely.

He had just been appointed to a chair in the ancestral hall of the Spring Dew Garden. Although he merely replaced Tang Xi as a supporting figure, flanking her on either side, it symbolized a significant rise in reputation for both the mountain’s immortals and the secular dynasty below, with an influx of extra divine money each year. It also meant a rise in status for some mortal families.

Thus, when facing the young Sword Immortal, Song Lanqiao felt he had received a great favor, which was not an exaggeration. However, being a wise man used to business, he was pragmatic and did not overly fawn over the young man named Chen.

On the ferry, Song Lanqiao arranged for them to have a room with a heavenly designation. After some consideration, he decided against allowing the maidens from the Spring Dew Garden to show their faces.

Inside the room, Cui Dongshan poured a cup of tea for Chen Ping'an and leaned over the table, his large white sleeves taking up nearly half the surface. With a grin, he said, “Sir, when it comes to fighting, ten Spring Dew Gardens couldn’t match one Pi Ma Sect. But in business, Spring Dew Garden truly holds its own against Pi Ma Sect. In the future, we at Falling Star Mountain and Spring Dew Garden will have plenty to discuss, and we can definitely engage frequently.”

Chen Ping'an sipped his tea without replying.

Cui Dongshan continued, “Tan Ling is a cautious one. Right now, Spring Dew Garden’s business is at its peak. On the mountain, they are entirely dependent on Pi Ma Sect, while down below, they focus on courting the Da Guan Dynasty. This isn’t wrong. However, now that the foundation is laid, Tan Ling has noticed many lingering issues in Spring Dew Garden—many elders have grown accustomed to comfort or still have ambitions in their cultivation, but there are too few capable individuals. Even if she wanted to support Tang Xi, she would hesitate, fearing that this wealth god would entangle her with the greedy Gao Song, resulting in a disastrous partnership. If Tan Ling’s time comes and Spring Dew Garden needs to change hands, it would lead to chaos. Tan Ling’s faction has many disciples, but very few can hold their own. In a clash with Tang Xi and Gao Song, they would struggle to win, and when it comes to wealth, it's a world apart.”

“Therefore, the alliance of Tang Xi and Lin Chao is the most stable choice. Although Lin Chao has a bad temper, he is ultimately unambitious and loyal to Spring Dew Garden. With Song Lanqiao, who is immensely grateful to Tan Ling, the three of them together could usher in a new era for Spring Dew Garden. If we at Falling Star Mountain were to lend a hand and help Spring Dew Garden open the northern gateway to Treasure Bottle Continent, even a small opening would invigorate the many cultivators along the slopes and foot of the mountain. Right now, Treasure Bottle Continent is buzzing with construction, and with Spring Dew Garden’s resources, it would be the most suitable business partner for us. We just need to pay attention to how Spring Dew Garden adapts to the climate of Treasure Bottle Continent. Thankfully, the Da Li Dynasty, from civil officials to military generals, gets along well with the cultivators of Spring Dew Garden.”

“Sir's long-term planning and precise, meticulous moves are truly commendable.”

Hearing this, Chen Ping'an finally could not help but smile, “Is it you who has ruined the feng shui of Falling Star Mountain?”

Cui Dongshan feigned indignation, “How could that be! Old Chef Zhu, Senior Sister, Brother Da Feng—all experts in this! Besides, how is the current feng shui of Falling Star Mountain lacking?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I never planned to collaborate with Spring Dew Garden. To put it bluntly, I never dared to think of it. Just doing some business for the Burden Shop would be quite good enough. If this really comes to pass, most of the credit will be yours.”

Cui Dongshan raised an arm and tapped the table three times, forming a triangle. “Tang Xi, Lin Chao, Song Lanqiao—one triangle. Tan Ling’s faction, Gao Song’s faction, Tang Xi’s little hillock—another triangle. Falling Star Mountain, Pi Ma Sect, Spring Dew Garden—yet another triangle. The various forces you’ve gathered together, at the southern end of North Ju Lu Continent and the northern part of Treasure Bottle Continent, form an even larger triangle. The relationships in this world can be boiled down to this: the most stable.”

“Sir, are you still unwilling to acknowledge that you are a master of strategy?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head and smiled, “It’s just happenstance.”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “Sir’s humility is commendable; I have learned from it.”

Chen Ping'an playfully scolded, “Get lost.”

Cui Dongshan was about to reply when Chen Ping'an immediately interrupted, “Still coming?!” 

Cui Dongshan felt utterly helpless, as if all his skills and weapons had lost their purpose.

Indeed, the teacher was truly formidable.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan asked, “When we arrive at the Bone Marsh, should we meet with Gao Cheng? I can guarantee a worry-free round trip for you.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not going to Jingguan City for now.”

Cui Dongshan inquired, “Is it because this person actively broke through the heavenly curtain for the Pu Rang Sword Festival, still possessing some heroic spirit?”

Chen Ping'an said, “It’s not that simple; it’s much more complicated. We’ll talk about it later.”

Cui Dongshan naturally had no objections.

As they passed over the vicinity of Suijia City and Cangjun Lake, Chen Ping'an stepped out of the cabin, and Cui Dongshan joined him at the bow, gazing down at the earth.

The vast Cangjun Lake looked like a jade pebble quietly resting in a crystal-clear stream from the ferry’s perspective.

He still owed a feast to a certain Fire God Temple over there.

But for now, it would have to remain an outstanding debt.

Cui Dongshan whispered, “Sir, you shouldn’t take such risks in the future.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Of course, I should nod and agree. I truly will pay attention now, reminding myself to stay away from turmoil. Once I become a cultivator on the mountain, the affairs of the world below will be just that—external matters. But you and I both know that when the moment arrives, it’s hard to avoid.”

Cui Dongshan leaned on the railing, his legs bent, the sleeves that hung outside the railing looked like two small white waterfalls.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Is Zhu Mi Li getting accustomed to staying at Falling Star Mountain?”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Very much so. She thinks of Pei Qian, who copies books every day, as a true scholar, eagerly waiting for Pei Qian to write a story about the water monster of Mute Lake for her in the future. The little girl is overly eager, always following Pei Qian around, carrying her walking stick. Now that she has been promoted from right guardian of Qi Long Alley to the right guardian of Falling Star Mountain, she even has to cough twice to clear her throat before speaking to others, imitating my Senior Sister’s bad habit.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “That’s good.”

Cui Dongshan curiously asked, “Are you really going to include that little girl in the genealogy of Falling Star Mountain’s ancestral hall, making her a right guardian similar to a mountain peak’s worship?”

Chen Ping'an said, “Of course. This is no joke. I used to hesitate, but after witnessing the towering peaks and undercurrents of Spring Dew Garden, I became resolute. I want outsiders to find Falling Star Mountain strange and incomprehensible. I am not unaware of the costs involved in doing this, but I can find ways to compensate elsewhere, whether it’s through me, the mountain lord, working harder to earn money and diligently cultivating, or through you, my student, or even Zhu Lian and Lu Baixiang. Our existence is the reason for Zhu Mi Li and Chen Ruchu’s existence. It will also give some new faces at Falling Star Mountain a reason to think, ‘This is how it should be; it’s not strange.’”

“I don’t reject the idea of Falling Star Mountain becoming a sect in the future, but I absolutely won’t intentionally gather forces at the expense of those flowers and grasses by the roadside. Those flowers and grasses were never insignificant at Falling Star Mountain, nor will they be in the future. Moreover, they have never been mere beautiful scenery by the roadside; they are a part of my life. Being able to care for those worth caring for gives me great peace.”

Chen Ping'an turned to say, “Can you understand what I mean?”

Cui Dongshan vigorously nodded, “I understand and accept!”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “But it will definitely not be easy.”

Cui Dongshan said, “Every grand statement, every ambition, will not be easy when acted upon.”

There were some things Cui Dongshan was reluctant to voice.

All the joy from long-awaited reunions would inevitably turn into sorrow at the time of parting in the future.

However, this did not hinder the joy of those meetings that could still happen, bringing happiness, drinking, and smiles.

But do not forget, sometimes, parting is just parting.

Chen Ping'an also leaned over the railing, gazing at the golden clouds illuminated by the great sun in the distance, asking, “Being my disciple, you won’t feel uncomfortable, right?”

Cui Dongshan replied, “Not at all.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “The disparity in realms and knowledge is significant; you, as my disciple, are surely fine.”

Cui Dongshan retorted, “If you say that, I will have to disagree. What if Pei Qian’s martial arts progress leaps forward, breaking through realms like that little millet eating rice, one bowl after another, leaving those dining alongside her astounded? Wouldn’t that make you uncomfortable as well?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Of course it would be uncomfortable. Where would my reputation as a master go? When it’s time for reasoning, if my voice is raised a bit, wouldn’t I be scared of my disciple retaliating with a chestnut? Wouldn’t my heart be uneasy?”

Cui Dongshan burst into laughter.

The teacher’s northern journey was a great opportunity for cultivation.

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping'an said, “I’m a stubborn person, fond of getting stuck in my own ways. One day, over at Falling Star Mountain, there will be some trivial matters that turn into significant dilemmas for me. At that time, you can offer some advice.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “As the sage said, when there’s a matter, the disciple should bear the burden.”

Cui Dongshan turned his head, resting his cheek against the railing, smiling with squinted eyes, “If there’s food and drink, sir, is it not filial duty to treat?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Don’t misinterpret the essence of moral texts, ruining the heartfelt intentions of the sages.”

Cui Dongshan replied, “Sir, don’t forget, back in the day, I was truly spirited and sharp, my vast knowledge overflowing, unable to be contained. Others couldn’t block it either! I’m not bragging without basis; becoming the head of the academy was within reach. If I really wanted to be a merchant, even the deputy head of the cultural temple in Central Earth wouldn’t be out of my reach.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “If the national master says that, I believe it. As for you, let’s drop it. The wind is strong at the bow; be careful not to twist your tongue.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “Speaking of which, I really don’t need to draft when I brag.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Is Central Earth vast?”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Very vast. The combined territories of the eight continents can only match Central Earth. Among the other eight continents, if one or two can squeeze into the top ten of Central Earth, that’s impressive. For example, there’s the esteemed scholar Chen Chunan from Nan Posa Continent, the external clan Grand Master from Longhu Mountain in North Ju Lu Continent, and the wealth god Liu from Aiai Continent.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Then we must definitely go see it in the future.”

Cui Dongshan lamented, “That’s a sad place for me.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “You asked for it, so you’ll have to grin and bear it.”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “You’re quite ungrateful.”

As the ferry entered the territory of the Bone Marsh, Song Lanqiao proactively came aboard, bringing gifts.

Two gifts, to be precise.

One for himself and one for Tan Ling of the Spring Dew Garden.

His gift was a treasure selected by his mentor Lin Chao from the ancestral hall—a bamboo box engraved with dragon patterns made from the enchanted wood unique to Spring Dew Garden, containing four jade tablets.

Tan Ling’s gift was priceless, one of the few treasures of great value from the Spring Dew Garden, a set of eight exquisite ink cakes.

As he handed them over, Song Lanqiao felt a pang of pity for Tan Ling.

Chen Ping'an did not refuse the gifts. The fact that Tan Ling had not personally delivered them at Fu Shui Ferry but had instructed Song Lanqiao to present them just before docking was a show of sincerity.

This was Song Lanqiao’s first official duty since becoming a member of the Spring Dew Garden’s ancestral hall, and it went smoothly, relieving his tension.

However, sitting together with the teacher and student while drinking tea made Song Lanqiao somewhat uneasy, especially with Cui Dongshan beside him.

Cui Dongshan twirled his fingers around the cup, lightly tracing patterns on the table, smiling, “Lanqiao, there are many unfortunate souls in this world, searching high and low for a temple while holding a pig's head. You’re one of the lucky ones.”

Just a moment ago, Chen Ping'an had addressed him as “Senior Song,” but now, with both the teacher and student calling him Lanqiao, he felt quite awkward.

The Spring Dew Garden treated others with sincerity, and Chen Ping'an would not let Cui Dongshan jest at this moment. He waved his hand, signaling he needed to discuss something with Song Lanqiao.

Unexpectedly, this simple action led to a scene that made Song Lanqiao break out in a cold sweat.

It seemed as if the white-clad youth had been sent flying by a slap from Chen Ping'an, spinning through the air along with the chair, before finally sticking against the wall, slowly sliding down. Cui Dongshan, with a mournful expression, sat back in his chair, saying timidly, “I’ll just sit here.”

Chen Ping'an wore a dark expression.

Song Lanqiao was astonished; could it be that this amiable Chen Sword Immortal was just like Liu Jinglong from Taihui Sword Sect—not a mere Earth Immortal, but a deeply concealed Jade Purity Sword Immortal?

Chen Ping'an couldn’t be bothered with Cui Dongshan and began discussing matters seriously with Song Lanqiao, negotiating the future collaboration between Falling Star Mountain and Spring Dew Garden. They were merely discussing a broad framework and direction. Song Lanqiao wouldn’t be able to make the final decision right then and would need to return to the ancestral hall for some heated debates. Once both sides ultimately agreed to collaborate, all specific matters would still require Zhu Lian and Wei Bo to set the rules.

Chen Ping'an was relatively familiar with the business of Spring Dew Garden, so conversing with Song Lanqiao felt natural. His time spent in North Ju Lu Continent was not wasted. Falling Star Mountain’s greatest asset was undoubtedly the pivotal Niujiao Mountain ferry, where Wei Dashan Jun was stationed. This ferry could accommodate most intercontinental ferries from North Ju Lu Continent, akin to a Burden Shop having a physical storefront. Money from all over the world would pass through here, generating more wealth.

Sometimes, Chen Ping'an would ponder how many cultivators a heavily worn-out snowflake coin had encountered. A thousand? Ten thousand? Had it traveled across the vast territories of the world?

Song Lanqiao had originally been focused on discussing significant matters with Chen Ping'an, and in his mind, the old Golden Elixir practitioner felt that their conversation might determine the major direction of Spring Dew Garden for the next century.

Then, Song Lanqiao noticed Chen Sword Immortal glance toward the wall.

Following his gaze, he saw the white-clad youth clutching the armrests of the chair, swaying precariously, as if the legs of the chair were his own legs, stumbling about.

Upon noticing, Cui Dongshan immediately stopped moving, whistling innocently.

Song Lanqiao offered a polite smile before withdrawing his gaze.

This guy must be out of his mind! He definitely is!

Chen Ping'an chatted with Song Lanqiao for a full hour, with both sides proposing numerous possibilities and enjoying the conversation. As the discussion progressed, Song Lanqiao relaxed significantly, entering a comfortable rhythm. Many thoughts he had accumulated over the years could finally be expressed. The young Sword Immortal across from him, frequently pouring tea, turned out to be a surprisingly congenial businessman. His language was never absolute, often phrasing things like, “Some aspects need clarification, I kindly ask Senior Song to elaborate,” or “Regarding this matter, I have some differing thoughts; please listen first, Senior Song, and feel free to voice any objections.” His wording was generally gentle, but he was not ambiguous. Some small schemes Song Lanqiao had considered to undermine Gao Song were deftly sidestepped by the young Sword Immortal, who merely stated, “This matter may require Senior Song’s extra diligence at the Spring Dew Garden ancestral hall.”

The white-clad youth remained idle, swaying in his chair, circling around the table. Fortunately, the chair made no noise as it moved, leaving no trace of disturbance.

Song Lanqiao had learned to ignore it.

After their discussion, Song Lanqiao felt refreshed. The tea was all gone, and although he still felt there was more to discuss, he stood up to take his leave.

Song Lanqiao insisted that Chen Ping'an need not see him off, and the young man smiled, merely escorting him to the door, with Cui Dongshan accompanying him.

Once Song Lanqiao entered the corridor, he did not see the young Sword Immortal in the green shirt; only the beautiful white-clad youth remained, which immediately put the old Golden Elixir practitioner on high alert.

He watched as the youth stepped back, gently closing the door, then turned to smile at Song Lanqiao.

Song Lanqiao felt his smile stiffen.

Cui Dongshan instinctively bent down beside the tensed Song Lanqiao, jumped up, and wrapped an arm around his neck, dragging the old Golden Elixir practitioner forward, “Brother Lanqiao, you speak so eloquently, your words flow like a river!”

Song Lanqiao could hardly suppress the urge to call out for Chen Ping'an to help him out.

Suddenly, Song Lanqiao felt a chill run down his spine and wanted to stop, but he found it impossible to do so as he was gently pulled forward by the youth. The moment he took a step, he realized something was wrong.

In the next moment, the white-clad youth vanished from view.

Song Lanqiao found himself enveloped in a thick white fog, with no scenery around, as if he was in a dead little world. The sight before him was a chilling shade of white, and walking felt slightly unstable, as if he were not walking on any earthly soil. When he exerted more force with his steps, he only made ripples on the ground.

He cautiously began to walk. After a stick of incense burned, he started to ride the wind. An hour later, Song Lanqiao had to summon his magical treasure, neglecting the etiquette he once held dear. He unleashed a torrent of radiant light, bombarding the surroundings, yet he could not change this little world in the slightest. A year later, Song Lanqiao sat cross-legged, looking withered and resigned.

In an instant, he looked up and saw a gigantic head—belonging to the youth, whose face bore a smile, yet his eyes were cold. The youth slowly raised an arm.

Song Lanqiao’s scalp tingled; he had been spinning around on the youth’s white sleeve the entire time?

In the next moment, the exhausted Song Lanqiao found himself standing in the corridor of the ferry, the youth not far away, hands tucked into his sleeves, smiling at him.

Having survived the ordeal, Song Lanqiao nearly shed tears of relief.

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Sir asked me to see you off, so I took the liberty of extending the journey a bit. Lanqiao, you mustn’t complain to my teacher afterward, or next time I escort you, it might be ten or a hundred years later. Who knows then who would be seen as the mad one?”

Song Lanqiao trembled and replied, “Thank you for the reminder, Senior.”

Cui Dongshan asked, “Having grown accustomed to the vibrant spirit of Spring Dew Garden and the thin spiritual energy on the ferry, why do you find it hard to adapt in a place with no way out?”

Song Lanqiao was taken aback.

As Cui Dongshan brushed past him, he patted Song Lanqiao’s shoulder and said earnestly, “Lanqiao, if you neglect your cultivation, a Golden Elixir can be as fragile as paper.”

Slowly, Song Lanqiao turned around, bowing deeply in gratitude. This time, he was genuinely moved, “Senior’s teachings have cleared my confusion, though I have yet to see the true moon, the insights gained are invaluable.”

Cui Dongshan acted as if he hadn’t heard, knocking on the door, “Sir, would you like me to bring some fruits and tea?”

Song Lanqiao gazed at the side profile of the youth, feeling a strange sense of distance, as if it were a world apart.

Chen Ping'an opened the door, pressing down gently on Cui Dongshan's head, turning to ask Song Lanqiao, “Senior Song, is my disciple disrespectful to you?”

Song Lanqiao, whether in a moment of madness or enlightenment, blurted out a line he would never have dared say before, “To be honest, it’s quite unbearable.”

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, “Got it.”

The white-clad youth was grabbed by the ear, shouting as he was pulled into the room by Chen Ping'an.

Amid the commotion, a voice could be heard: “Damn it, Song Lanqiao, you heartless scoundrel! Just you wait... Sir, I was sincerely helping Lanqiao cultivate; I really didn’t mean to mess with him... Sir, I was wrong!”

Song Lanqiao shook his sleeves and strode away.

Comforted.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 670: Return to the Countryside (Part Two) 

The ferry at the Bone Beach dock was still, and Song Lanqiao had conveniently decided not to show up, leaving someone else to send them off. He found a flawless excuse to disappear early. 

Cui Dongshan rubbed his chin with his palm, glancing around. 

The two of them disembarked and made their way to the Pine Garment Sect's Mu Yi Mountain. 

Cui Dongshan started to vent his grievances, “Master, when Zhu Quan saw me for the first time, he said you had never mentioned me, pretending not to know me. It broke my heart! Well, I didn’t actually die, but it felt like half a death.” 

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “I’ve mentioned you a few times to Zhu Sect Leader, but he’s the head of a sect, with so many matters on his mind. He also needs to be wary of the entire Ghostly Valley; it’s no surprise he might forget about you.” 

Then Chen Ping’an reminded, “Zhu Sect Leader is a rare sight among cultivators on the mountain, someone I greatly respect. When we get to Mu Yi Mountain, don’t cause any trouble. And that young man, Pang Lanxi, is the direct disciple whom Mu Yi Mountain holds in high regard. As an outsider, you should refrain from speaking recklessly. I know you usually have a good sense of propriety, but this is Bone Beach, not your own destitute mountain.” 

Cui Dongshan nodded and glanced at Mu Yi Mountain, a hint of regret in his eyes. 

With nothing to do, he found it a bit boring. 

Upon reaching the gates of Mu Yi Mountain, they encountered no obstacles. Most of the Pine Garment Sect’s disciples recognized Chen Ping’an, especially since he had just returned from his travels not long ago. 

Zhu Quan was not on the mountain; he had already gone to the Ghostly Valley’s Qinglu Town. 

However, Du Wensi had returned to the Ancestor Hall and was currently in seclusion, striving for a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage, with great hopes for success. 

Cui Dongshan mentioned Du Wensi with a grin, “Master, this kid is infatuated. I heard that the female immortal from Taiping Mountain, Huang Ting, visited Ghostly Valley specifically for Du Wensi. She didn’t want him to think too much about it, so she left him a line saying, ‘In this life, I, Huang Ting, have no Dao companion,’ which broke Du Wensi's heart. But after being heartbroken, he still had some thoughts, thinking about a girl he couldn’t have. Fortunately, he doesn’t have to worry about other men getting her, which is a small consolation. So, he started to think that if his realm were higher, he might have a chance in the future, maybe go visit Taiping Mountain, or even travel the rivers and mountains with Huang Ting...” 

Chen Ping’an laughed, “You’ve only been at Mu Yi Mountain for a few days, and you’ve figured all this out?” 

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Just wandering around. The mountain and the foot of the mountain aren’t that different. When everyone has free time, they love to chat about these romantic entanglements, love-stricken men, and resentful women. Especially those young female cultivators who admire Du Wensi; they’re worse off than him, all angry and complaining, saying what’s so great about Huang Ting? Just a bit higher in cultivation, a bit better looking, and from a bigger sect...” 

Mu Yi Mountain, the site of the Pine Garment Sect, was similar to most immortal sects’ ancestral peaks. The mountain path was mostly a direct flight of stairs. 

However, direct disciples often had the ability to ride the wind or fly with swords, while some mountain peaks had no restrictions even for ordinary disciples. But for immortal sects, there was usually a principle that each bird has its own way, with different levels and routes. In Longquan County, it was different mainly because it was still in its early establishment phase. Additionally, Longquan Sword Sect and the Destitute Mountain originally had few disciples, and they didn’t emphasize these formalities, making them appear quite unique. In contrast, the Pine Garment Sect and Chunlu Garden were well-established immortal sects, with many rules and strict laws. In Chen Ping’an’s view, this was actually a good thing. 

But in this world, nothing comes without a price. The reason Chunlu Garden was so unstable was that their superficial sect laws and formalities had not truly penetrated the hearts of the people. 

In this regard, Chen Ping’an genuinely admired the Pine Garment Sect. From Sect Leader Zhu Quan to Du Wensi and Pang Lanxi, each had their distinct personalities, yet they shared a common aura. 

Life and death were small matters; sect affairs were paramount. 

Cultivators pursued immortality, yet every Pine Garment Sect disciple was willing to sacrifice their life for the sect. Zhu Quan and the past sect leaders and ancestors, whenever faced with mortal danger, led by example, willing to die first! 

The elder lawmaster of the Pine Garment Sect glided down the stairs on the wind and landed gracefully before the two of them. He smiled at them, “Young Master Chen, Daoist Cui, I apologize for not welcoming you well.” 

After the greetings, Chen Ping’an noticed something strange: this elder seemed particularly close to Cui Dongshan, speaking to him as if they were old friends. 

Could it be that Cui Dongshan had not just been idly wandering around Mu Yi Mountain? 

Otherwise, even if he had fought against the people of Jingguan City, it wouldn’t have earned the respect of an elder lawmaster so readily. The disciples of the Pine Garment Sect were all seasoned fighters who had carved their paths through blood and bone, even someone like Du Wensi, who seemed gentle and refined, had his hands stained from battles in Ghostly Valley. 

The elder personally led them to the residence where Chen Ping’an had stayed before. 

The Pine Garment Sect’s ferry, which traveled between Bone Beach and Old Dragon City, would need about ten days to return to the northern continent. 

Pang Lanxi and his great-grandfather, Pang Shanling, were already waiting at the entrance. 

The young man waved with a smile, “Mr. Chen!” 

When they met, Pang Lanxi’s first words were a piece of good news, whispered, “Mr. Chen, I managed to get two sets of Divine Maiden drawings from my great-grandfather for you.” 

Chen Ping’an asked softly, “What’s the price?” 

Pang Lanxi grinned, “According to market price...” 

He paused, “That’s impossible! They’re a gift, no charge!” 

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Your great-grandfather is too kind. But let’s settle on market price; friendship is one thing, business is another.” 

Pang Lanxi looked a bit disappointed, “It’s only been a few days since we last met, and you’re already being so formal, Mr. Chen?” 

Chen Ping’an lowered his voice, “A polite remark doesn’t cost anything. You be polite first, and I’ll be polite, then we won’t need to be polite at all.” 

Pang Lanxi broke into a wide smile. 

He learned something new again. 

Mr. Chen truly had a wealth of knowledge. 

The four of them took their seats, with Pang Lanxi being the youngest and of the lowest rank, standing behind his great-grandfather. 

Chen Ping’an got straight to the point and started discussing Chunlu Garden. 

The elder lawmaster of the Pine Garment Sect, named Yan Su, immediately sent a flying sword message to a Nascent Soul cultivator from another peak named Wei Yusong. Wei Yusong was a generation lower than Yan Su but was not young, and he was a peer of Pang Lanxi. Holding a significant financial position within the sect, he was a wiry and small but sharp-eyed elder who treated Chen Ping’an and Cui Dongshan with great courtesy upon meeting them. 

After Zhu Quan managed to strike a small deal with the Destitute Mountain at the Junjiao ferry, the first thing he did was seek out Wei Yusong for a chat. On the surface, it appeared he was concerned about Wei Yusong’s cultivation affairs as a sect leader, but in reality, he was seeking credit. Wei Yusong was amused yet speechless, refusing to flatter Zhu Quan even a bit, which left Zhu Quan feeling quite stifled. 

Wei Yusong had a good impression of the young man in the green shirt but didn’t think much beyond that. 

However, he held deep respect for the young man, Daoist Cui. This was simple to understand: after Daoist Cui arrived at Mu Yi Mountain, he had wandered around for two days and then went to the Ancestor Hall of the Pine Garment Sect, presenting a large stack of blueprints. He straightforwardly pointed out that the mountain’s protective formation was a bit crude and wasted the fighting capacity of the spirits. As a result, the Ancestor Hall gathered and even invited an elder from the Mo family who was skilled in mechanisms. They discovered that modifying the mountain's formation according to Daoist Cui’s blueprints would only cost about a thousand Grain Rain Coins while increasing the formation’s might by twenty percent! The Mo family elder felt so ashamed that he nearly resigned from his position after diligently completing the revisions. 

To be frank, even a small expenditure of a thousand Grain Rain Coins was a worthy investment to save many sect disciples’ lives. Moreover, it was said that if the mountain's protective formation could be enhanced to fifty percent effectiveness, it would be a turning point in the standoff between Bone Beach and Ghostly Valley. 

That’s why the elders at the Ancestor Hall of the Pine Garment Sect viewed Daoist Cui with increasing fondness. 

Especially when that young man in white left the blueprints behind, casually mentioned some key points in the Ancestor Hall, and then swaggered off to continue exploring Mu Yi Mountain, chatting with the immortal sisters. 

Afterward, Zhu Quan personally approached Cui Dongshan to ask how the Pine Garment Sect could repay him. As long as he spoke, the Pine Garment Sect would go to great lengths to honor this bond. 

Cui Dongshan was not shy and directly named Du Wensi and Pang Lanxi, requesting that when they both eventually reached the Nascent Soul stage, they each serve as honorary disciples at the Destitute Mountain. It would just be honorary; the Destitute Mountain wouldn’t require them to do anything unless they volunteered. 

Zhu Quan was initially puzzled, “Just like that?” 

Cui Dongshan countered, “What else should it be?” 

Zhu Quan felt guilty and said something heartfelt, sighing, “That Chen Ping’an doesn’t mention you as his student at all. It’s truly unreasonable; he must have lost his conscience. Next time he comes to Bone Beach, I will definitely scold him for you.” 

Cui Dongshan was on the verge of tears, looking pitiful, “Sister Zhu, it’s actually your conscience that’s been eaten by a dog.” 

Zhu Quan then spoke a fair word, “Chen Ping’an should feel proud to have you as a student.” 

Cui Dongshan reciprocated, “Sister Zhu is such a great woman, yet still without a Dao companion; that’s truly unjust.” 

Thus, the two nearly got into a spat. Zhu Quan left for Ghostly Valley’s Qinglu Town still fuming. 

Wei Yusong was a shrewd businessman; otherwise, with a sect leader like Zhu Quan and unreliable elders like Yan Su, the Pine Garment Sect, even with its few direct disciples, would have long been worn down to nothing by the dull knives of Jingguan City, exhausting the sect’s foundation. 

Whenever Wei Yusong participated in discussions at the Ancestor Hall, even facing Zhu Quan and his own teacher Yan Su, he never wore a smile, preferring to bring a ledger to the meetings and flipping through it while delivering sharp critiques, one after another. Over time, the elders in the Ancestor Hall learned to smile and pretend not to hear, getting used to it. 

Wei Yusong thought it was no problem to help Chunlu Garden transport goods to Baoping Continent, but the matter of splitting the profits needed careful negotiation. 

As Wei Yusong calculated the accounts, Yan Su and Pang Shanling began to smile as was their habit. Cui Dongshan felt it was not his place to speak and exchanged glances with Pang Lanxi. Pang Lanxi was wary of this strikingly handsome “peer,” fearing that his childhood friend might encounter someone better, leading to some thoughts of jealousy. Especially when going down the mountain to the Mural City to see her, she had casually mentioned this young man from the foreign town who came to buy Divine Maiden drawings, speaking of him in a way that seemed to hint at his peculiar temperament. This left Pang Lanxi feeling quite unsettled. 

Pang Lanxi had been feeling increasingly anxious lately. 

So he particularly wanted to consult with Mr. Chen. 

Chen Ping’an, the wild cultivator, and Wei Yusong, who managed all the funds of the Pine Garment Sect, began to haggle. 

Even Chen Ping’an felt a bit helpless. 

Wei Yusong was just a bit too stingy. 

He didn’t have an ounce of the dignified bearing of a sect master. 

Once there were some details that were hard to negotiate, Wei Yusong would bring up an elder who had traveled far, always ready to throw mud, saying with certainty how the elder was rigid and old-fashioned, how he counted every single cent with the utmost meticulousness. Even the slightest suspicion of harming the sect’s interests would have this elder demanding accountability in the Ancestor Hall, leaving no one with face. Wei Yusong had the least standing in the Pine Garment Sect; whoever asked him for money raised their voice, and if he didn’t comply, it would lead to a falling out. Some relied on their higher cultivation, some on their seniority, and some shamelessly used their low cultivation and status to stir trouble. 

Listening to Wei Yusong's complaints, it seemed like he was the only troublesome one in the entire Pine Garment Sect. 

Eventually, Chen Ping’an had no choice but to lightly set down his teacup and cough. 

Cui Dongshan, who had been yawning, immediately sat up straight, saying, “About the protective formation of Mu Yi Mountain, there’s actually room for improvement.” 

Wei Yusong slammed the table, “Everything will be according to Young Master Chen’s words; it’s settled!” 

Chen Ping’an, with a face full of sincerity, asked, “Will this make it difficult for the Pine Garment Sect?” 

Wei Yusong proclaimed with righteousness, “What kind of joke is that? As long as it’s related to money, even Zhu Sect Leader can’t dictate what Wei Yusong does!” 

Chen Ping’an pretended to understand, nodding with a smile. 

Wei Yusong maintained his smile. 

Indeed, they were kindred spirits. 

Wei Yusong left with Yan Su and Pang Shanling. 

Wei Yusong insisted on catching up with Daoist Cui, so Cui Dongshan had no choice but to follow. 

Only Chen Ping’an and Pang Lanxi remained. After taking a seat, Pang Lanxi said softly, “Mr. Chen, is this Cui senior truly your student?” 

Chen Ping’an nodded, “If you think it doesn’t seem like it, that’s quite normal.” 

Pang Lanxi hesitated to speak. 

Chen Ping’an smiled, “If you find it hard to ask for help, then...” 

He stopped speaking and raised his hands, gesturing. 

Pang Lanxi immediately understood; it was about the Divine Maiden drawings. 

He hurriedly flew back to the residence and placed two wooden boxes on the table. 

Besides that, there was also a letter sent from Cloud City addressed to him, Pang Lanxi, to be forwarded to “Mr. Chen.” 

Chen Ping’an received the letter and tucked it into his sleeve, smiling, “Do you feel more confident speaking now?” 

Pang Lanxi whispered, “Mr. Chen, I’m a bit worried.” 

Chen Ping’an understood. 

Pang Lanxi was a youth who didn’t need to worry about his cultivation; his troubles were not about the path of cultivation but rather the survival of his sect. The Pine Garment Sect couldn’t exactly be said to be in crisis, or rather, it had always faced numerous hidden dangers, and all the disciples were used to it. So all that remained was this matter. 

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Why don’t you tell me about it first, and then I’ll help you analyze it?” 

Pang Lanxi shared his concerns, but they weren’t anything major. 

Just the youthful confusion of feelings, sometimes roundabout, not just the girls who would twist and turn. 

After listening, Chen Ping’an thought for a moment, suppressing a smile, and said, “Don’t worry; the girl you like will definitely not waver and turn to like Cui Dongshan. Besides, Cui Dongshan doesn’t fancy the girl you love.” 

Pang Lanxi’s face flushed, infuriated, “Mr. Chen, I’m getting angry! What do you mean Cui Dongshan doesn’t fancy her?!” 

How could Mr. Chen say such things! 

It wasn’t like this before. 

Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but laugh. 

Pang Lanxi thought for a moment, scratching his head, feeling a bit embarrassed. 

That knot in his heart unraveled. 

Not only that, deep down, the youth felt a surge of determination; he resolved to cultivate diligently, ensuring that the girl he liked would know she had not misjudged him and would never regret it for a lifetime. 

Chen Ping’an then said, “That girl likes you not because you, Pang Lanxi, are a genius in cultivation, but if you can prove yourself to be a true genius in cultivation, then the girl who likes you will be even happier for you, and she’ll be happy herself.” 

Pang Lanxi asked softly, “Is it really like that?” 

Chen Ping’an nodded, “It is; I am certain of this.” 

Pang Lanxi leaned on the table, lost in thought. 

Chen Ping’an opened one of the wooden boxes, took out a set of Divine Maiden drawings, and spread it out on the table, admiring it. It was indeed a masterpiece of Pang Shanling. 

Suddenly, Pang Lanxi asked, “Mr. Chen, there must be many girls who like you, right?” 

Chen Ping’an slowly put away the Divine Maiden drawings, shaking his head, “Not at all.” 

Pang Lanxi shook his head, “I don’t believe it.” 

Chen Ping’an opened the letter from Xu Xingjiu, which was concise, discussing the recent happenings in Cloud City, and saying that they were ready, just waiting for Liu to successfully ask for the sword, before visiting Taohui Sword Sect again. This time, it would be a journey of experience, going north to Taohui Sword Sect and south to Bone Beach. 

After reading the letter, Chen Ping’an said, “I have a friend, the letter’s author, Xu Xingjiu from Cloud City. He might come here to travel in the future. If you have time then, you can help me host him. If you’re busy, don’t worry about it. This isn’t just polite talk. If he’s not my friend, he will definitely be your friend, so there’s no need to force it.” 

Pang Lanxi nodded in agreement, “Okay, I’ll send a letter to Cloud City first to make an appointment. Whether it leads to friendship or not, we’ll see when we meet.” 

Mr. Chen’s friend was definitely worth getting to know. 

Just like earlier when Mr. Chen discussed Chunlu Garden with Wei Shixiong, even though Pang Lanxi was inexperienced in worldly affairs, he understood that there weren’t many Pine Garment Sect disciples, so he had some idea of their attitude towards Chunlu Garden. There was no contempt, but they absolutely couldn’t be called friends; it was merely business. After all, Chunlu Garden’s copper stink was a bit too strong, and the Pine Garment Sect’s disciples didn’t like this. Thus, over the years, Chunlu Garden had wanted to pay their respects to Wei Yusong but didn’t dare to appear too excessive. Furthermore, Song Lanqiao, who managed the ferry for Chunlu Garden, had a hard time speaking clearly in front of Wei Yusong, who had a prominent status in the Pine Garment Sect and was notoriously hard to deal with. 

However, when Chen Ping’an spoke up about having the three powers work together on cross-continental business, Pang Lanxi found that Wei Shixiong had loosened up from the start and had no intention to refuse. 

Pang Lanxi felt this was a lesson he needed to learn from Mr. Chen. 

In dealing with people and affairs, there was a significant amount of knowledge. 

Chen Ping’an finally said, “Do you know that when you worry about Cui Dongshan, the girl you like is actually the happiest? That’s why she smiles more than usual; it’s because she truly senses your tension.” 

Pang Lanxi changed his worry into joy, his smile radiant. 

Chen Ping’an laughed, “What are you still dawdling for? Go take a public trip to see her!” 

Pang Lanxi stood up, “If I had known, I should have asked Mr. Chen for a few more sets of Divine Maiden drawings.” 

The youth left. 

Chen Ping’an sat alone. 

After a while, Cui Dongshan strolled in, his sleeves swaying. 

He noticed a slab of blue brick placed on the table in front of his master. 

Cui Dongshan felt a bit flustered and immediately stopped, standing still. “Master, I had no idea about Pei Qian learning martial arts! It was Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, and Wei Bo who knew but didn’t tell you; I have no connection to this!” 

Chen Ping’an replied unhappily, “This has nothing to do with you. If there’s a grievance, it has its source. I won’t trouble you.” 

Cui Dongshan immediately beamed, “If you want to teach those three a lesson, I can help!” 

Chen Ping’an ignored him and pointed at the blue brick, which had yet to completely refine the Water and Dao intent from the mountain shrine, saying, “I’ve gathered thirty-six of these blue bricks. In the future, I plan to lay them on the ground at the Destitute Mountain for six people to practice their stances: me, Pei Qian, Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, Lu Baixiang, and Cen Yuji.” 

Cui Dongshan, looking as if he had lost his loved ones, extended his right hand and one finger from his left hand, lamenting, “Master, what about me? I’m your proud disciple!” 

Chen Ping’an said helplessly, “I’ll give you my share.” 

Cui Dongshan then extended two fingers, rubbed his eyes, and laughed, “Tears of sadness have turned into tears of joy; Master truly is a genius!” 

Chen Ping’an shot him a sideways glance. 

Cui Dongshan sat down honestly. 

Chen Ping’an pushed the blue brick toward him, “Your handwriting is good. I just remembered this matter and thought to let you write some appealing phrases on the back of the blue brick. Then, we can secretly lay the blue bricks without anyone noticing. Who knows, one day in the future, someone might see them by chance, and it would be a small surprise. It’s nothing major, just a bit of fun.” 

Cui Dongshan nodded eagerly, sitting cross-legged on the stone bench, leaning forward, pressing his hands on the blue brick, and softly said, “Master, we need to carefully consider these thirty-six phrases; they must be stunning and earth-shattering.” 

Chen Ping’an asked, “Do you think it will work if we write a phrase for everyone at Destitute Mountain and carve it on? As for the rest, you can recite the words of sages from the books.” 

Cui Dongshan gleefully replied, “That’s doable!” 

Chen Ping’an said, “Annoyed?” 

Cui Dongshan replied begrudgingly, “Even Master’s jokes are so brilliant.” 

Chen Ping’an rubbed his chin, “This Bone Beach’s feng shui has been spoiled by you.” 

Cui Dongshan raised both hands, imitating the senior sister, “Heavens and earth, witness my sincerity!” 

The two of them boarded the Pine Garment Sect’s cross-continental ferry, truly beginning their journey back home. 

While practicing martial arts and training, Chen Ping’an took the initiative to ask Cui Dongshan a question. 

“Given the vast scholarship of Confucian sages, why are they unwilling to speak in detail about self-cultivation, learning, and doing good, and instead speak in a chaotic manner? At the very least, within Confucianism, each should express their views separately. The multitude of opinions is more like a quarrel than a discussion.” 

Cui Dongshan, for once, was serious rather than flattering and asked in return, “Do you think many of the teachings are too complicated and high-flown, leaving people bewildered?” 

Chen Ping’an thought for a moment and nodded. 

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “Some teachings should be lofty. The reason people are different from grass, trees, birds, and beasts, and from all other sentient beings, lies in these lofty teachings above their heads. There must be knowledge that can be applied immediately, spoken clearly and plainly, established rules. But if there’s no lofty knowledge that inspires people to strive for it, making them willing to make the effort to explore, then that’s a mistake.” 

Chen Ping’an remained silent for a long time before finally nodding, “That makes sense.” 

Cui Dongshan slowly continued, “Let’s return to your initial question.” 

Chen Ping’an, however, said, “No rush; I’ll think about it a bit more. Shall we play a game of chess?” 

Cui Dongshan laughed, “Master’s chess skills are pure and true, soaring to the clouds; how could a disciple like me teach you? I feel so ashamed.” 

As he spoke, he took out the chess box and board. 

Chen Ping’an straightened his face, “In the future, you should talk less at Destitute Mountain.” 

Cui Dongshan lifted his sleeve, picked up a chess piece, hovering it in the air, smiling, “If Master doesn’t speak, how could I dare open my mouth?” 

Chen Ping’an also picked up a chess piece. 

As Cui Dongshan sat down before the chessboard, his entire demeanor changed, and he calmly said, “Disciple dares to propose, Four No Worries, Middle Heaven Origin, plus three edge lines, giving Master twelve pieces.” 

Chen Ping’an glanced at the earnest Cui Dongshan, silently returned the chess pieces to the box, stood up, and left directly.
