 ### Chapter 433: Don’t Fly Too Far

The old man sighed, “If one day you suddenly go missing, it’s definitely because you've done something foolish. You know that both you and your brother are striving for the Nascent Soul, but he’s been harsher on himself. He abandoned many of the innate divine abilities of the Dragon lineage, choosing instead to become a mere water god bound to a river.”

Wu Yi's eyes lit up. “So, to ‘return’ to the Nascent Soul, we need to become deities?”

The old man regarded his daughter with pity, feeling somewhat disheartened. It was clear she was not the sharpest tool in the shed. “Your brother’s direction is correct, but he’s gone too far. In the end, he completely severed his connection to the path of the Dragon lineage. That’s why I’ve lost hope in him. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be sharing all this with you. You’re studying alternative paths, and using borrowed wisdom to forge your own path is also valid. However, you still haven’t grasped the true teachings, and you haven’t traveled far enough yet. At least you still have a glimmer of hope.”

The old man tapped the railing with a finger. “It’s not about being caught between two extremes; it’s right here—between gods and humans. That’s the fundamental path that aligns with the Dragon lineage. This was laid down by our ancestors a thousand years ago when the Dragon lineage governed all the rivers and lakes, and every watery place was our domain. Your brother is clever but has been led astray, mistakenly believing that the orthodox path of the ancient gods, ‘Sealing the Right,’ is akin to the current imperial edicts, which is utterly misguided. He’s strayed onto a wrong path. But now, the rules of heaven and earth have changed significantly, affecting us greatly. After that bloody upheaval back then, we have been shunned by the invisible forces of the Dao, making it exceedingly difficult to attain the Nascent Soul…”

Wu Yi finally couldn’t hold back her question. “Father, you still haven’t told me how I can cultivate to achieve the Nascent Soul. Just tell me directly!”

The old man smiled and countered, “You and I are father and daughter, so you think it’s only natural for your cultivation to be passed down from me?”

Wu Yi immediately felt a sense of dread, fearing that she was about to face some hardship.

As expected, the old man sneered, “The idea of filial piety and obedience is something Confucianism teaches, but it’s not something I teach. I’ve never expected obedience or respect from my descendants. You should know this better than those siblings still in my womb. So, how should you act as a daughter?”

Wu Yi’s face turned pale.

The old man grinned, revealing a few white teeth. “If you can’t achieve the Nascent Soul within a hundred years, I might as well eat you. Otherwise, you’ll just waste my Dragon lineage's fortune. Given how effective you were in handling that task, I’ll share a piece of information with you: that Chen Pingan possesses a snake gallstone condensed from the last drop of true dragon blood. A few of them are of quite good quality. If you consume one, you might not reach the Nascent Soul realm, but at least it could enhance your combat power. When the day comes that I eat you, you can struggle a bit more. What do you think? Isn’t your father being rather loving?”

The tall Wu Yi trembled.

The old man suddenly lamented, “You eat the spirits of the waters, while I feast on you to gather fortune. That CUI Dongshan, who occupies a remnant of an ancient shed, might just eat me in turn. What should we do?”

He smiled at Wu Yi. “So don’t think that being high in cultivation and skill is something to be proud of. There’s always someone better. We should still be grateful for the rules set by the Confucian sages. Otherwise, you and your brother would have already been my next meal, and I would have been on my way to becoming CUI Dongshan's snack. In today’s world, don’t be fooled by the conflicts among the countries below the mountains or the disputes among the sects on the peaks. Do any of these truly qualify as chaotic times? Haha, I wonder if, when the scenes of ten thousand years ago reappear, everyone will run to the local Confucian temples, kneeling and bowing their heads?”

Wu Yi felt no connection to these “great matters.” 

Her mind lingered on the method to reach the Nascent Soul.

The old man asked, “What four items did you give to Chen Pingan?”

Wu Yi answered honestly, “One item from each floor: a piece of iron that crystallized from the first spring thunder, about the size of my thumb and weighing six pounds. A high-quality spirit artifact robe made of spring grass. Six ‘Fox Beauty’ talisman paper dolls specially made by the Xu family of Qingfeng City. And a spirit-rich green plum pit that, when buried in the ground, can grow into a thousand-year-old yangmei tree in a year. It releases spiritual energy on the day of the twenty-four solar terms. An ancestor from the Lingyun Sect once wanted to buy it for a high price, but I couldn’t bear to sell it.”

The old man nodded. “Not bad.”

Suddenly, he laughed. “Don’t think that flattering a blind man will help. The North岳’s true god, Wei Ban, will explain everything clearly to Chen Pingan. But the premise is… that Chen Pingan can make it to the Abandoned Rock Mountain. It all depends on the outcome of the contest between Master Cui and Cui Dongshan.”

Wu Yi caught the shocking implication in his words. Cui Chan and Cui Dongshan battling? Yet, she remained fixated on the notion of “between gods and humans,” pleading, “Father, if I can reach the Nascent Soul, wouldn’t it mean I could do even more for you?”

But the old man had already put away his little boat, retracted the small world’s divine powers, and vanished in an instant, returning to the Cloud-Peak Mountain of the Great Li.

Only Wu Yi was left, filled with melancholy and dread.

A hundred years. 

It was a lifespan that an ordinary person would dream of, but to Wu Yi, what did it matter?
————

The water god of the Incense Temple was overly attentive along the way, forcing Chen Pingan to call upon Zhu Lian to fend off the calamity.

Before long, Zhu Lian and the river god were calling each other brothers. When they reached the ferry, the two parted reluctantly, with the river god addressing Zhu Lian as ‘Big Brother’ with sincere familiarity.

As the river god took the ferry back, Chen Pingan and Zhu Lian withdrew their gazes. Chen Pingan smiled and asked, “What did you talk about? You seemed to hit it off so well.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “What can men talk about? Women, of course. We chatted about that Lady Xiao Luan halfway.”

Chen Pingan couldn’t be bothered to say anything further.

Suddenly, Zhu Lian’s face flushed with embarrassment. “Young master, if we encounter any dangerous scenes in the future, can I take on the burden for you? I’m also an old hand in the world, not afraid of wind or waves. I wouldn’t dare hope to win over a mountain water deity like Lady Xiao Luan, but as long as I can let loose, utilizing my skills, I could surely attract her maidens and those young female cultivators from the Ziyang House in no time—at most three days…”

Chen Pingan quickly interrupted Zhu Lian’s words, especially considering Pei Qian was still nearby. This girl was young and had a particularly sharp memory for such things, more so than for her studies.

Zhu Lian was unwilling to give up, muttering, “Young master, the local water and soil nurture local people. There must be a bevy of beauties back in Longquan County, right?”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment and shook his head. “In terms of looks, it doesn’t seem much different from an ordinary market town.”

Zhu Lian sighed, “What a pity.”

But Zhu Lian quickly added, “I took the liberty to chat a bit about Sun Dengxian with that river god brother. I suspect that even if Sun Dengxian encounters some trouble in the Huangting Kingdom in the future, as long as this river god, who’s good at research, hears about it, he might just be able to help him out. But young master, be prepared, because that river god will surely come to you for credit, even from thousands of miles away.”

Chen Pingan gave Zhu Lian a thumbs-up. “You did well on this matter.”

Zhu Lian curiously asked, “Young master, why do you admire Sun Dengxian so much?”

Chen Pingan answered without hesitation, “Because he’s a great hero. When we wander the martial world, if we don’t admire great heroes, should we be idolizing flower thieves instead?”

Zhu Lian said seriously, “Young master, I, Zhu Lian, am not a flower thief! We are known for our charm…”

Chen Pingan dismissed Zhu Lian with a single sentence. “Spare me.”

Pei Qian shook her head, mimicking Chen Pingan’s tone and adding fuel to the fire, “Spare me.”

Zhu Lian made a move as if to kick, frightening Pei Qian into running away.

Chen Pingan, just like the first time he traveled back to his hometown from the Great Sui, did not choose the Wild Man Pass as his entry route.

They arrived at the elegant county at the border of the Huangting Kingdom, which meant they were only six hundred miles from Longquan County.

Further ahead, they would pass a long cliffside path. Last time, he had been accompanied by a young boy in green and a girl in a pink dress. During a fierce snowstorm, when Chen Pingan stopped to light a campfire, he coincidentally encountered a pair of master and servant passing by.

The more Chen Pingan thought about it, the more he felt that the gentle and composed man he met then was quite a remarkable figure.

After passing the elegant county, as dusk fell, their group arrived at that familiar path.

Chen Pingan chose a spacious spot, planning to camp there for the night. He reminded Pei Qian to practice her Mad Demon Sword Technique without getting too close to the edge of the path.

Pei Qian curiously asked, “But Old Cook can fly. Even if I accidentally fall, he can save me, right?”

Chen Pingan casually remarked, “If you want to fly with the wind, you can directly ask Zhu Lian for help, but you still need to be cautious while practicing your sword. Those are two different matters.”

Pei Qian responded with an “oh.”

Holding her trekking staff, Pei Qian began to swing it against the heavens, earth, and monsters.

Each time she did so, Zhu Lian found it hard to watch.

On the other hand, Shi Rou enjoyed watching Pei Qian’s antics. She sat on a rock, admiring Pei Qian’s swordsmanship.

Pei Qian practiced diligently, working up a sweat. After putting down her staff, she laid her master's bamboo box horizontally to use as a desk and took out her belongings. Taking advantage of the last rays of the setting sun, she squatted down and began to copy texts.

Once she finished copying, Zhu Lian had already cooked the rice. Shi Rou and Pei Qian took out bowls and chopsticks. Zhu Lian produced two wine cups, and Chen Pingan poured out the old dragon's coveted wine from the sword nurturing gourd. The two would occasionally indulge in a small drink like this.

Pei Qian, with her usual vigor, finished a big bowl of rice long before Chen Pingan and Zhu Lian started on their second cup of wine. With a beaming smile, she asked Chen Pingan, “Master, can I take a look at that small purple sandalwood box? If something inside goes missing, we can go back along the same route to find it early.”

Chen Pingan took a sip of the fine wine and smiled. “Go ahead and look for yourself.”

Pei Qian then took out the beautiful little wooden box from the bamboo box, sitting cross-legged beside Chen Pingan. She opened it and began to check the contents one by one: a thumb-sized but heavy iron block, a folded piece of blue clothing weighing less than two taels, and a stack of talisman papers depicting beautiful women. She flipped through them repeatedly, fearing they might sprout legs and run away. Suddenly, Pei Qian panicked, “Master! Master! The plum pit is missing! What should we do? Should I go look for it right now?”

Zhu Lian rolled his eyes.

Shi Rou couldn’t help but chuckle. “Can you at least hide the laughter in your eyes when you’re trying to trick someone?”

Chen Pingan said, “Oh, it’s fine. I have money now, so if it’s lost, it’s lost.”

Pei Qian laughed, flipping her wrist and spreading her palm. “Master, since we thought it was lost earlier, doesn’t that mean we have an extra plum pit now?”

Chen Pingan nodded with a smile.

Pei Qian laughed heartily. “Master, you’re so silly! It wasn’t lost in the first place! How can you not see that?”

Chen Pingan flicked her forehead.

Pei Qian didn’t budge, making a gesture as if she was gathering her energy. “Not a bit painful!”

Zhu Lian could no longer contain himself and flicked his fingers in mid-air.

Pei Qian was so shocked that she quickly placed the plum pit back in the small box, bent down quickly to set it aside, and then hugged her head, bursting into tears.

Chen Pingan couldn’t help but laugh.

Seeing that even her master was not concerned for her, Pei Qian peeked at him from behind her fingers, crying even harder.

Chen Pingan had no choice but to quickly suppress his smile and asked, “Do you want to see your master flying with the sword?”

Pei Qian’s lips turned down, and she said aggrievedly, “I don’t want to.”

Chen Pingan merely smiled.

Pei Qian suddenly beamed, “I really do want to!”

Chen Pingan took down the half-immortal sword from his back, but instead of drawing it, he stood up and faced the cliff, then tossed it out.

Chen Pingan quickly stepped forward, patted the sword nurturing gourd, and shot out, stepping on the long sword to soar away.

Pei Qian gasped, quickly getting to her feet and running to the edge of the cliff, wide-eyed as she stared at her master’s dashing figure flying on the sword.

Zhu Lian and Shi Rou obviously knew the secret; the flying swords were cleverly hidden beneath that sword.

Pei Qian shouted, “Master, don’t fly too far!”

In the mountain wind, Chen Pingan slightly bent his knees, standing on the sword, connecting with the two flying swords in spirit. The sword’s sheath tilted upwards, suddenly soaring higher. Chen Pingan, with the sword beneath him, broke through a layer of clouds, coming to a momentary halt. Below him lay a golden sea of clouds shimmering in the afterglow, boundless and vast.

Between heaven and earth, there was profound beauty that spoke without words.

Chen Pingan then realized that his experience of flying with the sword was entirely different from looking down at the sea of clouds while riding a celestial ferry.

He gazed at the sea of clouds for a long time. As the sun sank below the horizon like it was falling into the sea, the afterglow gradually faded. Finally, Chen Pingan stood on the long sword, closed his eyes, held his breath, and focused on practicing the sword furnace stance.

After retracting the sword furnace, a thought crossed his mind, and he murmured, “Did Cao Ci break through again?”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 434: Revisiting Old Grounds

Zhu Lian noticed that after Chen Pingan returned from his sword flight, something about him felt different. 

It was an elusive sensation, one that Zhu Lian could only perceive after spending so much time with Chen Pingan, akin to the ripples stirred in a pond by a gentle spring breeze.

After waiting for most of the day, Chen Pingan told Pei Qian to go to bed and, for the first time, invited Zhu Lian to drink with him. The two sat cross-legged on the cliffside outside the path, and Zhu Lian chuckled, "You seem a bit happy, Young Master. Is it because the joy of sword flight is so exhilarating?"

Chen Pingan countered, "Do you remember Cao Ci?"

"How could I forget that name? At the Sword Qi Great Wall, you lost to him three times in a row. I wish I could meet him tomorrow and knock him out with a punch or two, just to save you from competing with him for the world's fortunes in martial arts and delay your ascent to that legendary Eleventh Realm, the Martial God Realm," Zhu Lian joked.

Chen Pingan didn’t dwell on Zhu Lian's flattery or humor; he took a leisurely sip of the wine from the Sword Nourishing Gourd and said, "I can't help but wonder if it’s just my imagination, but Cao Ci might have broken through again."

Zhu Lian raised an eyebrow, puzzled. "Then why would you feel happy about that? The throne of the world's number one martial artist can’t accommodate two. Of course, it’s still too early to say anything about your relationship with Cao Ci."

Chen Pingan took a small sip of the wine and asked, "What do you think we martial artists train for?"

Zhu Lian replied with a grin, "Naturally, for ultimate liberation and freedom. To be able to do anything we want and say no to what we don’t wish to do. Historically, every number one in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land has pursued their own path, but in this regard, we converge. Whether it’s Sui Youbian, Lu Baixiang, Wei Xian, or I, Zhu Lian, we share the same goal. However, the Lotus Flower Blessed Land is a small place; everyone here feels little connection to immortality. Even those of us at the pinnacle of the world don’t think much about it because we never realized there was a ‘heaven’ above us. The vast world is far stronger than we are. Seeking the immortals and understanding the Dao, among the four of us, Wei Xian has gone the farthest. After all, a person who has been an emperor would inevitably think of longevity after shouting 'Long live!' to his subjects often enough."

Chen Pingan pointed at himself. "I didn’t tell you much about my earlier days. I started training because someone broke my bridge to immortality, and I had to rely on martial arts to survive. I kept at it, and when the time came to fulfill my promise and deliver the sword forged by Ruan Qiong to Miss Ning at the Upside-Down Mountain, I had traveled a great distance. By the time I reached the mountain, I was almost ready to throw a million punches. At that point, I started to feel a nagging doubt: having no need to train just to survive, I am not the type to always strive for first place. So what should I do next?"

"Should I become the next Zhu He? It wouldn’t be too difficult, or perhaps the next Song Yushao of the Shushui Kingdom, which is also not too hard. Or should I keep punching away for another million times, hoping to someday embody the essence of a gold-bodied martial artist? You have to understand, I was at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the place with the most sword cultivators. Just a few steps away from where I lived, there was an old sword immortal who had lived there for ages. Under my feet were words carved by the great sword immortal and A Liang. Do you think I didn’t want to switch to sword training? Of course, I did."

"That’s why I was so eager to rebuild the bridge to immortality back then. I even considered, since I couldn’t focus on two things at once, maybe I should just abandon martial arts and dedicate myself to sword cultivation, nurturing my own life sword and eventually becoming a true sword immortal—a great sword immortal! Of course, I wanted that, but I didn’t dare to tell Miss Ning. I was afraid she would think I wasn’t dedicated and could easily give up on martial arts, just like that. Wouldn’t it be the same with her?"

Zhu Lian took a big gulp of wine. "Old servants like me met you too late and missed out on the flavors of your youthful melancholy. I must drink to drown my regrets."

Chen Pingan tilted his head back, wrapped his arms around the Sword Nourishing Gourd, and lightly tapped it, laughing, "At that time, I met Cao Ci. So, I am grateful to him, though I feel a bit embarrassed to say it out loud."

Chen Pingan pointed at himself again, then gestured toward the towering cliff across from them. "Cao Ci might be just over there, and I’m quite far from him. Although I don’t deliberately seek to be the best in martial arts, I’m not a fool; who would willingly choose not to be number one? Naturally, I want to be first, but I’m just... willing to take my time. Like before when I walked along the railing at the Ziyang Mansion's treasure house, I pondered the concept of ‘slowness’ and realized many things. If you trace it back to the beginning, I first encountered this notion when I was an apprentice at the dragon kiln learning pottery. The old man Yao dismissed my lack of talent and refused to teach me any principles, even shunning conversation with me. But back then, I viewed kiln firing as my foundation for survival. So, what could I do? Since he wouldn’t teach me, I listened in each time he spoke with Liu Xianyang and the other apprentices. He would tell them that the heart must be steady for the hand to be steady, and through slowness, one can avoid mistakes and become quick yet accurate. Logically, I should have grasped that principle early on, right? I should have remembered it well. But in reality, I hadn’t. Only after traveling a long way and meeting many people, witnessing so many principles that don't seem to have legs of their own, did it settle in my heart, as Miao Shan Zhu said, and then I truly owned those principles."

"When Cao Ci appeared, I realized that among my peers, it wasn't just Ma Kuxuan—I could also have Cao Ci. No matter how dazzling Cao Ci is, I never felt any hatred toward him, nor did I envy him. At most, I felt a bit disappointed. In front of the girl I adored, losing to someone else three times would naturally leave me feeling a bit off. So at that time, I resolved that one day, regardless of how high Cao Ci's martial arts realm might rise or how others might praise him as a peerless prodigy, I would make sure to defeat him three times!"

Chen Pingan's expression was calm, his eyes bright. "Only in the realm of martial arts!"

Zhu Lian slapped his thigh. "What a magnificent spirit, Young Master! Your ambitions are truly lofty!"

Chen Pingan patted the Sword Nourishing Gourd and gazed at the mountain wall opposite them, smiling, "I’m just talking nonsense under the influence of alcohol."

Zhu Lian, ever the understanding companion, shifted the topic. "You seem to be worried about something on your journey, Young Master?"

Chen Pingan nodded. "You’ve been paying attention to the situation in the Great Li Kingdom, so it’s no surprise you wonder why the National Master, Xiu Hu, is busy laying out plans elsewhere while Cui Dongshan appears at the Cliffside Academy."

Zhu Lian asked, "Isn’t it strange that someone at the upper five realms of divine powers can split their soul? We have Shi Rou living next to us, after all."

Chen Pingan shook his head. "Cui Chan and Cui Dongshan are already two different people, and they are beginning to walk separate paths. So, how do you think two individuals with the same core and nature will interact in the future?"

Zhu Lian chuckled. "With Cui Dongshan’s temperament, aside from you, he wouldn’t lower himself to anyone, not even to himself."

Chen Pingan murmured, "So how does the one who creates the colorful cloud chart play chess with himself?"

Zhu Lian began to frown, his expression turning serious as he turned to look at Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan nodded. "I suspect I am that chessboard. They might have started playing chess the moment we reached Old Dragon City."

Chen Pingan extended a finger, tracing intersecting lines. "Each intersection, large or small, like the Qingluan Kingdom, the Cliffside Academy, or smaller places like the Lion Garden, any celestial ship bound for the Great Sui, and even Ziyang Mansion, which we passed recently, could be part of it."

Zhu Lian asked, "Cui Dongshan wouldn’t do anything to harm you, right?"

Chen Pingan shook his head. "He has always been trying to help me; there’s no doubt about that."

Zhu Lian couldn’t help but stand up, his back slightly hunched, and said solemnly, "This is no small matter!"

Chen Pingan remained seated, gently swaying the Sword Nourishing Gourd. "Of course it’s not a small matter, but it’s fine. I’ve come this far through even greater schemes and more intricate chess games."

Zhu Lian moved slowly, rubbing his palms together. "I need to think this through."

Chen Pingan comforted him in return. "Don’t worry, it won’t involve life and death, so it won’t be that kind of brutal battle. It won’t be like Old Dragon City suddenly being beset by a deadlock like Du Mao."

Zhu Lian thought for a moment, his brow furrowing. "That makes it all the more troublesome, doesn’t it? Won’t I be completely powerless? Am I just supposed to stand by and watch? I might choke on my own frustration."

Chen Pingan gazed at the mountain cliff across from them, straightened his back, and cradled his head with his hands. "Whatever happens, we’ll take it step by step. There’s no reason to be afraid of returning home!"

Zhu Lian looked at Chen Pingan's profile. "When soldiers come, we’ll block; when water comes, we’ll cover? You’re quite carefree, Young Master."

Chen Pingan couldn’t help but exclaim, "Knowing too many principles can sometimes make the heart restless."

He bent down, stacking his palms and pressing them against the top of the Sword Nourishing Gourd. "The intersecting lines on the chessboard represent rules. Rules and principles are fixed; they are straightforward. But the world can bend these straight lines, and some people’s hearts may twist those lines into crooked circles. That’s what we call self-justification. So, there are many people in this world who have read plenty of books but still don’t speak of principles. Many can live well while talking to themselves, as they can find peace in their hearts and minds. In fact, they might even feel less constrained than those who adhere to the rules. How to live is simply to follow one’s heart. As for how it appears reasonable to make oneself feel justified, or to use it as a disguise to live better, there are countless quotes from all kinds of philosophical teachings. Just find a few sentences that resonate, and you can borrow those principles temporarily. What’s so difficult about that? It’s not hard at all."

Zhu Lian sighed deeply.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 435: The High Winds and Clear Waters

Sitting once again beside Chen Ping’an, Zhu Lian set down the wine jug that he had unknowingly emptied. The lean, stooped old man rested his fists on his knees, a hint of sadness in his eyes.

The heartfelt words shared among Chen Ping’an, Sui Youbian, Wei Xian, and Lu Baixiang would likely not weigh too heavily on their minds. Sui Youbian's heart was as clear as his sword, focused solely on the blade. Wei Xian was a battlefield general who had faced thousands, and Lu Baixiang was the founding master of the demonic sect in the Lotus Blossom Paradise. In truth, none of them could match the depth of conversation that Zhu Lian could provide.

Zhu Lian seemed carefree, treating both major and minor matters with indifference, never troubling himself over such things. Yet, he was the one among the four who had witnessed the most human experiences in the Lotus Blossom Paradise.

Born into a prestigious family, he understood the true taste of wealth and power. He had encountered emperors and high officials up close and personal. With an innate talent for martial arts, he stood out early on. Nevertheless, he conformed to his family's wishes and participated in the imperial examinations, easily earning the second-highest rank. That was only because a family elder, a high-ranking official, intentionally delayed his ranking; otherwise, he would have been first in his cohort. At that time, Zhu Lian was the most esteemed young talent in the capital, and countless noblewomen were infatuated with him over a casual piece of calligraphy or a spring outing. Eventually, he held a leisurely post as a noble official for several years before finding an excuse to travel far and wide, ostensibly to study but actually to wander aimlessly.

In this way, a free-spirited young nobleman inexplicably became the most renowned figure in the realm, conveniently becoming an insurmountable hurdle in the hearts of countless martial arts fairies and wandering heroines.

Then, amidst the chaos of war, as countries fought and lands were shattered, Zhu Lian withdrew from the martial world, returned to his family, and took to the battlefield. He became a brilliant scholar-general, turning the tides of war with sheer military strategy rather than martial prowess. In a six-year military career, he managed to support a crumbling empire for years. However, despite devoting himself to assist a prince and personally overseeing state affairs, he could not change the inevitable fate of the dynasty. After securing his family's future, he returned to a solitary life in the martial world once more.

According to Zhu Lian himself, even in his forties and fifties, he remained charming and charismatic, carrying the aroma of aged wine, still the "Zhu Lang" (Master Zhu) in the hearts of countless young maidens.

Chen Ping’an said, “Next, we will pass by a mansion where a ghost bride resides, marked with the plaque ‘High Mountains and Clear Waters.’ I plan to take you along while letting Shi Rou lead Pei Qian around that mountain, heading directly to a place called Red Candle Town to meet us.”

Zhu Lian perked up and asked with a grin, “Hmm, you mentioned this before, but you didn’t go into detail then. It sounds dangerous, but not overly so, right?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “That mansion is home to a ghost bride. Years ago, when I passed by with Bao Ping and the others, we had some issues, and I thought it was time to settle them.”

Zhu Lian realized, “No wonder you’ve been inquiring about Shi Rou’s knowledge of certain techniques related to spirits and ghosts lately, taking your time, preparing those talismans.”

Chen Ping’an abruptly raised a hand. “Silence.”

Zhu Lian felt a bit dejected; his master understood him too well.

He had been itching to ask about the ghost bride's appearance—was she beautiful or ugly, plump or slender? After all, in the Lotus Blossom Paradise, no beautiful ghost had ever admired him, and he wasn’t about to miss out on such an opportunity here in the realm of Haoran.

However, that water deity from the White Crane River, much like Shi Rou, seemed to pay him no heed. Zhu Lian rubbed his chin, annoyed. “What’s with this? Do the women here, whether ghost or deity, all judge by appearance?”

Chen Ping’an picked up his sword-sheathing gourd. “Let’s go.”

Zhu Lian glanced at the empty wine jug at his feet, a pained expression on his face. “Master, my wine jug is empty.”

With a grin, Zhu Lian rubbed his hands together. “Master, don’t worry about this old man’s drinking capacity. To quote Pei Qian, it’s no trouble at all! One more jug, that quenches my thirst; two jugs, I’ll feel tipsy; three jugs, I’ll be merry.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, opened his mouth wide, shook his head, and said with a smirk, “Go drink the northwest wind then.”

Zhu Lian stifled a laugh, determined to be a loyal minister offering earnest advice rather than a sycophant. With righteous indignation, he said, “Master, how can you tell such an unfunny joke? It makes it hard for me to flatter you.”

Chen Ping’an’s heart stirred. He took out a jug of wine from his storage, tossed it to Zhu Lian, and asked, “Zhu Lian, what kind of person do you think I am?”

Zhu Lian caught the wine and replied without hesitation, “A good person.”

Chen Ping’an laughed. “This wine wasn’t given to you for nothing.”

Zhu Lian shook his head. “Even without this jug of wine, I’d say the same.”

Chen Ping’an muttered to himself, “I’m just a good person, huh?”

Zhu Lian burst into hearty laughter. “You can take it as me flattering you; don’t take it seriously. Let’s drink!”

An elderly man from a wealthy family and a young man from a muddy alley didn’t let their master-servant relationship weigh heavily on their hearts as they leisurely enjoyed their wine on the cliff.

Wiping his mouth, Zhu Lian suddenly asked, “Master, shall I sing you a song from my hometown?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Sure.”

Zhu Lian quickly took a sip of wine to clear his throat before he began to hum a tune, swaying his head. It was a dialect from a long-lost dynasty in the Lotus Blossom Paradise.

Chen Ping’an couldn’t understand it, but as Zhu Lian sang with a sense of indulgence, it still felt rich and evocative.

After finishing a verse, Zhu Lian asked, “Master, what do you think?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Not bad, not bad.”

Zhu Lian shook the remaining half jug of wine. “If you could gift me another jug, I’ll sing it in the official dialect of the Great Li.”

Without hesitation, Chen Ping’an tossed another jug to him.

Zhu Lian set the jug aside and softly began to hum:

“Spring nights with lamps are like human eyes,  
See the maiden loosening her buttons,  
Green fingers twirling the ribbon’s knot,  
Soft snow-like breasts rise like peaks,  
The belly soft as cotton, alas the candlelight cannot see,  
The smooth back curves, tied with care,  
Hanging a large gourd, oh maiden,  
Thinking of the unreturned heartless traveler,  
A heart like a startled deer,  
Countless knots within the heart...  
The maiden twists her waist, turning to gaze at the two pillows,  
Hand covering the mountain peak, feeling sorrow,  
Since a moment is worth a thousand gold,  
Who will earn ten thousand taels?”

Zhu Lian paused, took a sip of wine, feeling quite pleased with himself.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Is that all?”

Zhu Lian was taken aback, “Master, you don’t even want to hit me for that?”

Chen Ping’an scoffed, “After walking so many paths in the martial world, I’ve seen greater things. What’s this? Back when I traveled the underground Dragon River, I rode a celestial ferry while gods fought above me, without distinguishing day from night.”

This was what it meant to be late to realize; it was all thanks to Zhu Lian, and of course, the long passage of time in the Lotus Blossom Paradise.

Zhu Lian inquired, “Tell me more.”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “I can, but first, hand me that jug of wine.”

Zhu Lian hesitated a moment before handing over the jug.

After Chen Ping’an tucked it away in his storage, he continued, “It was indeed a series of heart-wrenching bloody battles.”

Zhu Lian waited for a long time but received no further elaboration. “That’s it?”

Chen Ping’an stood up. “Otherwise?”

Zhu Lian hurried to his feet to follow Chen Ping’an. “Master, give me back the wine! Just those pitiful few words, saying them is like not saying anything at all—worth less than a jug of wine!”

Chen Ping’an ignored Zhu Lian.

On the pathway, a figure flipped over, walking upside down using the Earthly Stake technique.

Zhu Lian stood there, frustrated. Suddenly, he turned to look at Shi Rou, who was in a state of meditation, and smiled broadly.

Shi Rou opened her eyes and shouted angrily, “Get away from me!”

Zhu Lian raised his hand, playfully flicking his fingers at Shi Rou, “How annoying.”

Shi Rou felt disgusted.

In an instant, after a fleeting glimpse, she froze in shock.

Zhu Lian had pressed a finger to his temple and performed two gestures—one of tearing and one of smoothing over, lingering for a moment in between.

He smiled at Shi Rou, then turned, hands clasped behind his back, and began to stroll slowly into the night, leaving behind a figure who looked as if she had seen a ghost.

In the distance, Zhu Lian clicked his tongue. “What does that mean?”

---

After traversing the pathway and crossing the border between the Southern Garden Kingdom and the Great Li Dynasty, Chen Ping’an and Zhu Lian walked along the mountain road.

Shi Rou had already taken Pei Qian on a detour, following the Embroidered River toward Red Candle Town, where the two parties would eventually meet. Chen Ping’an had instructed Shi Rou to carry Pei Qian, allowing her to utilize her abilities, so it was likely that Shi Rou and Pei Qian would arrive at Red Candle Town first.

Chen Ping’an smiled as he recounted an old tale: it was on this very mountain path that he had encountered three individuals—a limping youth holding a tattered banner proclaiming “Exorcising Demons and Upholding the Way.” They ended up in a bind, captured by the ghost bride and taken to the mansion adorned with countless red lanterns. Fortunately, both sides emerged unscathed, and when they parted ways, the shabby old Taoist gifted them a map of the mountains passed down through his lineage. However, the three had traveled through Longquan County without stopping at the town, where they briefly met Miss Ruan Xiu, before continuing north to the Great Li capital in hopes of seeking their fortunes.

Choosing to ascend the mountain at dusk, Chen Ping’an paused when he reached the stretch of the path that had once played tricks on them, looking around and finding nothing amiss.

Carrying the sword immortal and bamboo box on his back, Chen Ping’an thought he resembled at least half a scholar.

Yet the ghost bride remained unperturbed; that was only natural. Back when Wei Jin had split the heavens with a single sword at the Wind and Snow Temple, and the chivalrous figure Xu Ruo had made an appearance, the ghost bride, having suffered a significant defeat, would likely think twice before harming passing scholars.

After some thought, Chen Ping’an said to Zhu Lian, “You should go up high and see if you can spot that mansion. Though I suspect it’s unlikely, there will definitely be some illusion obscuring it.”

Zhu Lian soared into the air. As a martial artist in the Transcendent Realm, he could venture to all corners of the world.

A moment later, Zhu Lian returned to the trail, shaking his head. “I can’t see it at all; it seems we’ve wasted two of your talismans, Master.”

Chen Ping’an laughed, producing two talismans—a Sunlight Lantern Talisman and a Mountain Water Barrier-Breaking Talisman—pinching them between his fingers, both drawn from the stack of yellow paper gifted by Li Xisheng.

He infused his own spiritual energy from the golden talisman within him into one of the Sunlight Lantern Talismans.

The flame was tiny.

Chen Ping’an leaped into the treetops, circling around to observe the burning speed and size of the flame on the talisman, finally determining a general direction.

Relying on the talisman’s guidance, he sought out the mansion’s water and mountain barrier, much like a scholar carrying a lantern at night, illuminating the path ahead.

Eventually, Chen Ping’an reached a mountain wall, and as the flame suddenly flared up, he flicked his wrist, infusing the Mountain Water Barrier-Breaking Talisman with spiritual energy, causing it to shine brightly. He pressed the talisman against the mountain wall, and the scene before him changed drastically. The wall melted away like snow meeting fire, revealing a fist-sized hole, through which a shadowy valley path emerged, exuding a chilling aura.

As the Mountain Water Barrier-Breaking Talisman burned close to its end, the hole expanded to the size of a courtyard gate, and Chen Ping’an and Zhu Lian stepped through.

In the secluded mountain hollow, where ancient trees towered, Chen Ping’an still held the remaining Sunlight Lantern Talisman, leading Zhu Lian forward.

Chen Ping’an didn’t elaborate on his past with the ghost bride.

However, Zhu Lian had never seen Chen Ping’an's intense dedication to such a “small matter” before.

To meet that ghost bride, Chen Ping’an had made numerous preparations and arrangements. Zhu Lian had previously experienced the turmoil in Longyu City with him, noticing how cautious Chen Ping’an was even in a dusty medicine shop. Every detail was carefully weighed. Yet, while both situations bore similarities, they were not entirely the same. It seemed that Chen Ping’an had waited a long time for this day, and when it finally arrived, his mindset was rather peculiar. It was akin to Zhu Lian’s own fighting style: before entering battle, he would hunch down and draw back, unlike the typical martial artist brimming with unrestrained vigor and confidence.

The Sunlight Lantern Talisman burned more quickly, and as the last bit of ash floated away.

The two finally stood in a plaza before a grand mansion displaying a plaque reading “High Winds and Clear Waters,” flanked by two massive stone lions at the entrance.

Chen Ping’an narrowed his eyes, gazing up at the plaque.

Once, a ghost bride clad in a bright red dress floated nearby.

She was infatuated; once a benevolent spirit, she had her own reasons for being so.

It was said that initially, a scholar walking at night had recited the verses of sages loudly on this mountain path to bolster his courage, catching her attention.

The scholar and the ghost bride were from different realms, yet they still shared a mutual affection, and she willingly donned the red wedding dress.

Chen Ping’an tugged at the corners of his mouth.

There is no hierarchy in reasoning; that’s something Chen Ping’an himself had said.

For those who disregard reason, live however they please, it’s all their own path. But if one day they meet someone who speaks logic and possesses a stronger fist, they should hope for a better reincarnation. Chen Ping’an had said that too.

And so, Chen Ping’an stood there.

Zhu Lian couldn’t help but turn his head.

Even Zhu Lian, a martial artist in the Transcendent Realm, sensed an unusual aura emanating from Chen Ping’an.

Was this the manifestation of a pure martial artist reaching the pinnacle of the fifth realm?  
Like the bright moon rising in the sky.

But this was nothing compared to what truly astonished Zhu Lian. It was the outward display of Chen Ping’an’s state of mind and aura.

That bright moon, like a dragon carrying a pearl.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 436: Heading South**

Just as Zhu Lian was starting to think that this ghost-hunting trip had little to do with him, the grand door of the estate swung open, and a figure emerged.

Zhu Lian couldn’t help but ask, “Young Master, is that the ghost's lover? Quite the impressive figure—he looks no less significant than the White Swan River deity of Lady Xiao Luan.”

The person who stepped out was tall and imposing, donned in armor, with a golden-eyed azure snake coiled around his arm. His every breath exhaled white mist, reminiscent of incense smoke lingering in a temple.

Chen Ping’an recognized this man; he had previously appeared on the Embroidered River alongside Xu Ruo. This individual was likely one of the river gods of either the Embroidered River or the Jade Liquid River.

The Embroidered River, the Jade Liquid River, and Chess Table Mountain, along with this estate, all held significance. Wei Ban had once remarked that they were hidden existences meant to suppress the residual fortune of the Divine Water Nation. Thus, while the deities of the Embroidered and Jade Liquid Rivers governed similar water territories as the Grand Li River deity, their status was slightly higher.

The river god of the Embroidered River spoke in a deep voice, “Chen Ping’an, you have broken the barrier of the local mountains and waters without permission and trespassed into the Chu estate. According to the mountain sealing laws established by the Grand Li, even a registered immortal would face the consequences of being stripped of their household registration and exiled for a thousand miles!”

Chen Ping’an raised an eyebrow in confusion. “What about Lady Chu?”

The river god waved his hand dismissively. “She has long since left the estate, and there is a new master here. However, considering you possess the Peaceful Affairs token and have been recorded in the Ministry of Rites, you are permitted to leave swiftly this time. But remember, this is a one-time allowance.”

Chen Ping’an clasped his hands in a respectful gesture. “May I ask, River God, where is Lady Chu now?”

The deity, whose golden form stood before him, frowned slightly and glanced at the long sword strapped to Chen Ping’an's back. “I only know that Lady Chu went to the Viewing Lake Academy, where a scholar has died. She intends to recover the remains, but she certainly will not be returning here anytime soon.”

With a sigh, Chen Ping’an realized he would likely return empty-handed, feeling a pang of regret for the two yellow paper talismans. He apologized to the river god, “Visiting Lady Chu this time was my oversight. I will be more careful in the future.”

The river god let out a cold snort. “Is there going to be a next time?”

Before Chen Ping’an could respond, the river god shot a sidelong glance at the hunchbacked elder beside him. “What? You think just because you’re a wandering martial artist, you can act recklessly?”

Zhu Lian wiped his face and turned to Chen Ping’an. “Young Master, just let me fight him. This guy’s face really deserves a good beating. I’ll definitely repay you with a gold coin later.”

Chen Ping’an motioned to Zhu Lian, signaling that he didn’t need to test the waters like that; the bride ghost was likely not at the estate.

Turning to the river god, Chen Ping’an smiled. “We will leave now.”

At that moment, a billowing black smoke erupted from behind the Chu estate, surging forward, and when it settled, it took the shape of a person clad in a dark robe.

The river god of the Embroidered River maintained a neutral expression. “Gu Master, weren’t you supposed to be repairing the mountain’s water veins?”

Chen Ping’an was taken aback; the current master of the estate was the very Gu deity who had escorted them before, and he was also Gu Can’s father.

The Gu deity nodded at Chen Ping’an and then smiled at the river god. “I sensed a practitioner breaking through the barrier earlier and thought the river god was here to check on the situation, so I didn’t intervene. But considering the recent chaos in the Grand Li, I was worried that a practitioner from the Great Sui might attempt to disrupt this place. I didn’t expect it to be an old acquaintance visiting instead.”

The river god squinted. “Back then, Gu Master escorted Chen Ping’an to the Great Sui, so it’s fair to say you’re familiar. I wonder if Gu Master intends to invite Chen Ping’an inside for a feast to welcome an old friend?”

The Gu deity laughed heartily. “Now that I’m the Gu Master, I naturally can’t delay important matters. I’ll just share a few words with Chen Ping’an and see him off from the Chu estate’s territory.”

“Repairing the water veins is a meticulous task that cannot be interrupted. I hope Gu Master won’t take too long; otherwise, I will have to address this officially and note it in the records,” the river god stated before turning and striding back into the estate.

The Gu deity clasped his fists in thanks and then approached Chen Ping’an, laughing boisterously before Chen Ping’an could speak. “I can’t help it. During that mission, I suffered quite a bit at the Ministry of Rites, gaining an ambiguous title as a mountain god. So everything has its rules, and I can’t invite you to the estate now.”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “It’s fine; there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. It’s not too far from Longquan County.”

The Gu deity suddenly bowed deeply, his expression turning melancholic. “During that last journey, I left without saying goodbye. Due to my circumstances, I couldn’t disclose personal matters. Now that I am one of the deities of the Grand Li, while I can’t leave carelessly, I might as well take this opportunity to reveal everything, relieving myself of a burden.”

At this point, the Gu deity revealed a smile and activated his divine powers, making his previously vague features clearer. “Who do I resemble more closely?”

Chen Ping’an stared at him for a moment, astonished. “Could it be...?”

The Gu deity burst into hearty laughter and clasped his fists again. “Chen Ping’an, if it weren’t for you, Gu Can wouldn’t have received such a great fortune! This debt of gratitude is larger than the heavens themselves; I would willingly repay it with my life!”

Chen Ping’an seemed to have trouble processing this. “No wonder I always felt you were sneaking glances at me back then; I even mistakenly thought you had ulterior motives. Uncle Gu, you should have told me sooner!”

After that, they talked about trivial matters from their past in Niping Alley, quickly arriving near the mountain and water barrier. The Gu deity’s expression faltered. “I can’t break the rules. By the way, as the river god mentioned, the Chu estate has been poorly managed; the water veins are in disarray and are in a precarious state. I can’t leave for too long, so I won’t see you off further.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and asked, “I’m returning from Old Dragon City. Since Shujian Lake is located in the central part of Baoping Continent, and with the war raging, even the immortal ferry won’t risk it. I plan to visit Shujian Lake soon to check on Gu Can. I wonder if Uncle Gu knows how he’s doing and if the River Ruler is treating him well?”

The Gu deity laughed heartily. “They’re doing very well. Little Can has already become the direct disciple of that River Ruler; there’s nothing to worry about. Otherwise, how could I remain at ease here?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, clasping his hands. “I wish Uncle Gu a swift elevation in status!”

The Gu deity quietly reminded him, “By the way, Chen Ping’an, have you heard that many immortal families who bought mountain tops back home are now hastily selling them off? You’d better hurry back; you might still snag a mountain at a low price. Such opportunities shouldn’t be missed.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled. “I’ve heard about it already, so I sent a flying sword message to Piyun Mountain, asking Wei Ban to help investigate.”

The Gu deity waved his sleeve, and a large door appeared in the mountain and water barrier. Chen Ping’an stepped inside, turning back to clasp his fists in farewell to the Gu deity.

Once back on the mountain path, Chen Ping’an sighed. “I never expected Uncle Gu would become a deity and even the master of this estate. I wonder when their family of three can be reunited.”

Zhu Lian smiled. “Even though we didn’t see that bride ghost, this trip wasn’t in vain. As you said before, Chess Table Mountain was originally a dormant place for Wei Ban, reduced to lowly gods and land deities, yet it has become the birthplace of the Grand Li’s northern mountain deity. Life is truly unpredictable.”

Chen Ping’an took a deep breath. “Let’s go to Red Candle Town.”

The two quickened their pace toward Red Candle Town, where Pei Qian and Shi Rou were.

They continued chatting until they had walked several dozen miles out of the mountain head. Zhu Lian slowed his steps, carefully using his martial arts skills to gather sound into a line, suddenly asking, “Young Master, what’s our next move?”

Chen Ping’an’s expression remained unchanged as he similarly used his skill. “No rush; we’ll plan our next steps once we reach Red Candle Town. Otherwise, Uncle Gu will face big trouble.”

———

**At the entrance of the Chu Estate.**

The river god of the Embroidered River wore a grim expression as he watched the master of the estate return slowly, his voice stern. “Gu Tao, I told you to stay near the estate’s water management area and not to move an inch! How dare you wander out?”

The imposing river god, with the azure snake coiling around his arm, shook it, causing the golden-eyed snake to slither to the ground and transform into a massive serpent, circling around both the master and the river god. It raised its head high, coldly staring at the Gu deity.

The river god reached out, and a finely crafted spear appeared in his hand, its golden light flowing like water as he sneered, “The National Advisor has decreed that if you make even the slightest transgression, I can strike half your soul away! If you’re unconvinced, feel free to resist using the Chu estate.”

The Gu deity stood still, his expression helpless. “I only appeared this time to reveal a secret I’ve held too long; I couldn’t keep it inside anymore. The river god came here on orders and had already reminded me, so I accept my punishment! But I hope you can tell me why I can’t even see Chen Ping’an. I wish to have a clear answer; otherwise, even if I accept my punishment, I can’t help but feel aggrieved!”

The river god fixed his gaze on the Gu deity, contemplating whether to simply shatter the Gu master’s soul entirely rather than merely half of it.

Gu Tao’s life hung in the balance.

He would undoubtedly face suffering, but currently, the Gu deity was needed to mend the Chu estate’s fortune. After all, this place now belonged to the Northern Mountain region, where the Mountain God, as the Grand Li Dynasty’s foremost new deity, was increasingly revealing signs of divine authority. Thus, determining when to strike half of Gu Tao’s soul would require consulting the National Advisor, as according to the Grand Li’s laws, he would also need to report to Wei Ban.

This was a matter of jurisdiction.

Had Gu Tao at any point shown even a hint of advising Chen Ping’an to go to Shujian Lake instead of encouraging him to return home to purchase mountains, he would have already been doomed.

This was reasonable; the rumors Gu Tao had heard about Shujian Lake from Red Candle Town were all information the Grand Li’s spies wanted him to know.

Without warning, the river god hurled the spear, piercing through the Gu deity’s abdomen and embedding it into the ground. The golden light flared as it burned a hole directly through Gu Tao, who had transformed from a ghostly form into a divine golden body, leaving him grievously injured.

Gu Tao, however, was indeed tough, remaining silent as his features began to contort, dark smoke rolling off him.

The river god waved his hand, unfurling a scroll; all the scenes within the Chu estate’s territory began shifting and changing with the river god’s will, showing every detail of the people and events vividly.

He opened another scroll, revealing the realm of the Embroidered River.

His tone was cold as he said, “If I sense even the slightest hint of suspicion, I won’t hesitate to kill you.”

With the golden spear still piercing through his abdomen, Gu Tao shouted angrily, “Have you lost your mind?! The National Advisor wouldn’t allow you to act so recklessly! Do you think I’m unaware you’ve been enamored with Lady Chu for hundreds of years?! Now that I occupy the estate, you find me displeasing and want me gone, just like that? If you’re looking for a pretext to act against me, you’ll have to do better!”

The river god ignored Gu Tao’s fury, focusing instead on the scroll depicting Chen Ping’an and Zhu Lian, scrutinizing their expressions and conversations, missing no details.

As for what the National Advisor was plotting, the river god had no interest or courage to explore further. He understood that any time the National Advisor stepped out of the shadows, it often led to bloodshed and chaos, with heads rolling, regardless of one’s status among the elite or mountain immortals.

He waved his hand, recalling the spear back into his grasp. “Return to the estate immediately and mend the local fortune. Await your fate; whether you live or die, that’s for you to figure out.”

Gu Tao covered his abdomen, feeling the pain as his divine form was wounded, his cultivation severely impacted. “You should know my origins; this matter isn’t over!”

The river god’s expression remained indifferent. “In the Grand Li, our greatest support is the laws established by the National Advisor to aid the emperor.”

———

Following the gracefully flowing Embroidered River, they arrived at the lively Red Candle Town.

Once, Chen Ping’an had purchased a book titled "The Great Cliff’s Broken Water" for Li Huai at a bookstore here.

Pei Qian and Shi Rou were staying at the inn where Chen Ping’an had previously lodged.

As they entered the room, Pei Qian was about to share what was interesting about Red Candle Town when she glanced at Chen Ping’an and immediately fell silent.

Zhu Lian shut the door and stood near the window, while Chen Ping’an began to meditate in silence.

Chen Ping’an got straight to the point. “I plan to hold off on returning to Longquan County for now. Zhu Lian, you take care of Pei Qian and Shi Rou and head to the Fallen Star Mountain. There’s an immortal ferry in Huang Ting Nation; I’ll see if there’s a boat going to Shujian Lake. If not, I’ll walk there. Once we’re in Longquan County, it’ll be harder to leave.”

Zhu Lian thought for a moment and slowly replied, “As an old servant, I have a decent disguise technique. Why not let me masquerade as the Young Master? You can pretend to be someone else, and then find a suitable opportunity for you to leave Red Candle Town first while we stay a few more days. It’ll be a bit safer; it may not fool everyone, but it would be better than nothing.”

Shi Rou looked puzzled.

Pei Qian was even more confused.

Zhu Lian spoke softly, “Young Master, you said it yourself, there’s no need to rush; take your time.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled. “Don’t worry, I have everything under control.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “The Young Master is indeed meticulous. Otherwise, by the time we reach Longquan County, that duel with Cui Dongshan would be a lost cause.”

From the point when the river god of the Embroidered River first appeared, and Uncle Gu followed, Chen Ping’an sensed a familiar aura.

So he chose to remain silent and wait for Uncle Gu to speak instead of greeting him outright.

Sure enough, Uncle Gu spoke with a hint of implication, “for the first time” revealing Gu Can’s father’s identity.

Chen Ping’an cooperated with Uncle Gu to play along.

Any well-meaning reminder for Chen Ping’an to hurry back to Longquan County to buy mountains.

Any mention of the two women being safe at Shujian Lake.

All Chen Ping’an had to do was listen and absorb.

Aside from that, they shared a silent understanding, never speaking more than necessary or exchanging an extra glance.

Because that river god of the Embroidered River was surely watching them from the shadows.

Next, Zhu Lian began helping to iron out the details, suggesting they first enjoy a drink at the unique flower wine tavern in Red Candle Town tonight, where many people gathered, making it perfect for covert observation. Chen Ping’an changed out of the required robe for Shujian Lake, switching to a blue shirt so that Zhu Lian could impersonate him when heading to the Fallen Star Mountain. Going without the robe would be too conspicuous.

Zhu Lian and Chen Ping’an collaborated, carefully checking over each other’s plans.

Pei Qian sat obediently on the side, refraining from making jokes at this moment.

Shi Rou stood by the window.

She no longer thought that Zhu Lian’s suggestion to drink flower wine was a private agenda.

That night, Chen Ping’an and Zhu Lian left the inn, enjoying a round of flower wine. Chen Ping’an sat upright, while Zhu Lian easily engaged in conversation with the tavern girl, making her feel as if she were in a different world.

The next day, Chen Ping’an took Pei Qian for a stroll around Red Candle Town, buying various items, as if they were back home and winter was approaching, a time to start preparing for the New Year.

A plain-looking middle-aged man quietly left Red Candle Town.

Instead of taking a ferry down the Embroidered River, he walked along a bustling official road toward the border, near the pass. He didn’t use any official documents to cross into Huang Ting Nation, but like a wild hermit who disliked constraints, he easily traversed the towering mountains, hurrying day and night.

Dusty and weary, he reached an immortal ferry in Huang Ting Nation. The middle-aged man did not bother to ask the attendant about the ferry. Instead, through casual conversation, he learned that there were currently no ferries directly to Shujian Lake, as that route had already ceased operations. He then opted for a ferry heading to a place called Gusu Mountain, which was rumored to have a connection to a vassal state of the Zhu Ling Dynasty. After that, he would have to walk to Shujian Lake.

The man paid a hefty sum of divine coin for a private cabin on the ferry, keeping to himself.

Upon reaching Gusu Mountain, the man heard bad news; even the ferries to the Zhu Ling Dynasty’s vassal state had ceased operations.

He lingered at Gusu Mountain for a day, exploring the area, eventually deciding to spend a fortune on divine coins, far exceeding the going rate, to hire a private boat that wasn’t too keen on following the rules. The boat owner, wearing a fawning smile while looking dumbfounded, watched as the man boarded the vessel, the only passenger aboard.

Surrounded by predators.

The man either lacked the experience to sense danger or was bold enough to deliberately ignore it.

When the ferry announced that it needed to dock for supplies, the man finally left his cabin, changing into a white robe, carrying a long sword on his back, with a hairpin holding his hair up and a wineskin at his waist.

He went directly to the ship captain, who had the cultivation of the Sea Observation Realm, and slammed the red wineskin, which appeared ordinary in the eyes of common practitioners, down. A flying sword shot out from his sword-raising gourd, and he said, “Divine coins are easy to earn, but once you lose your life, it’s over.”

The old captain, who had already contemplated murder and robbery, was also a wild outlander. Once he realized his guest had seen through him, he didn’t bother to hide anymore. He glanced at the wineskin, chuckling, “You probably don’t know the going rate in our line of work. A sword-raising gourd is worth more than my life and this boat combined. What do you think…”

Before the old captain could finish his sentence, the flying sword flashed and disappeared.

The old captain, having reached the Sea Observation Realm, was familiar with sword cultivators, especially one of the four most troublesome spirits from the mountains. He had a treasured spirit tool that could help him balance things out.

However, the old captain only narrowly avoided the flying sword with his life-bound artifact, only to have another flying sword pierce his forehead from the sword-raising gourd.

It didn’t kill him, but the slightest movement would push the sword deeper, and his life would be forfeit.

As the Sea Observation Realm old captain was stunned that a sword cultivator had two life-bound flying swords, a punch landed.

The punch sent all the spirit energy from the old captain’s energy gates boiling like boiling water.

Another punch.

The old captain, who could refine his physique with spirit energy, was comparable in toughness to a practitioner of the fourth realm, yet still found himself spitting bile and collapsing to the ground from a single blow.

The two flying swords lodged into the old captain’s energy gates, churning within and sending the Sea Observation Realm master crashing back to the Cave Dwelling Realm, howling in agony.

The man surveyed his surroundings, chose a chair to sit down, and told the others, “Continue on your way.”

Afterward, the old captain sat in a small corner of the relatively spacious room, the two flying swords orbiting him slowly.

Meanwhile, the guest sat there, leisurely reading books.

Summoning his courage, the old captain asked if he could stay there to heal his wounds to avoid potentially losing even the Cave Dwelling Realm.

The man nodded in agreement without objection.

Thereafter, the man continued reading book after book, occasionally dozing off, and sometimes standing up to pace, slowly throwing punches.

When the ferry arrived at the largest vassal state at the border of the Zhu Ling Dynasty, the man disembarked and handed over the remaining half of the divine coins.

After briefly asking the weary old captain for the general direction to Shujian Lake, he removed the long sword from his back, throwing both sword and sheath into the air.

He soared away on the sword towards Shujian Lake.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 437: Life Is Not a Story from a Book (Part 1)**

In the sky, eagles soared, while crows cawed from the withered branches.

The once smooth and wide official road had long fallen into disrepair, leaving a caravan jolting along the bumpy path.

As the largest vassal state of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, the Shihau Kingdom was located in the northwest of the dynasty. Renowned for its fertile fields stretching for thousands of miles and its rich resources, it had always been the granary of the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Unlike the vassals of the Dashi Kingdom, which had chosen a path of submission, the Shihau Kingdom—from the emperor to the high-ranking officials and the majority of military leaders—decided to confront the powerful cavalry of the Dai Li Kingdom head-on.

The flames of war had engulfed the entire Shihau Kingdom. Since the beginning of spring, the northern region, particularly around the capital, had seen exceptionally brutal fighting, and now the capital was deeply encircled.

Not only the common folk of Shihau were in despair; even smaller vassal states with far weaker military forces were filled with panic. Naturally, there were those who fancied themselves clever, rushing to pledge allegiance to the Dai Li Kingdom’s Song family, eagerly watching the chaos unfold from a distance. They hoped that the unstoppable Dai Li cavalry would sweep through and slaughter the loyal subjects of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, perhaps sparing their lives in the process. With their assistance, the Dai Li forces could easily seize well-fortified cities filled with armories and treasuries.

The treacherous journey had left many of the caravan's drivers lamenting their plight. Even the strong men, who bore longbows and sheathed sabers, felt their bones rattle with every jolt, their spirits waning. They forced themselves to remain vigilant, scanning the surroundings for any signs of bandit attacks. These young men, adept in the ways of battle, bore the scent of blood on their bodies, clearly indicating that their journey southward through this chaotic world was anything but easy.

It was truly a gamble with their lives at stake. To put it bluntly, the time it took to relieve oneself could very well lead to a loss of head.

The most dangerous ambush they faced was not from those desperate refugees turned bandits but rather a group of three hundred Shihau soldiers posing as marauders, mistaking the caravan for easy prey. In that brutal clash, almost half of the caravan's guards, who had signed their lives away beforehand, fell in battle. Had it not been for a seemingly inconspicuous immortal among the merchants, both men and goods would have been devoured by that gang of soldiers.

This caravan needed to traverse the heart of the Shihau Kingdom and reach the southern borders, aiming for the Book Lake, a place deemed a den of danger by the secular dynasty. With a substantial amount of silver in their possession, they dared only to stop at the border checkpoints. No matter how much silver they had, they didn’t want to venture any further south. Fortunately, a dozen or so foreign merchants had agreed to allow the caravan's guards to turn back at the Thousand Birds Pass, leaving the fate of this group of merchants—whether they would reap immense profits at Book Lake or perish along the way to be feasted upon by bandits—no concern of the caravan's.

This journey had truly become a hellish trial.

The sight of starving corpses scattered over miles was no longer merely a fleeting glimpse from the pages of a book.

Along the route, the caravan often encountered makeshift shops filled with anguished cries. Adults were seen selling their own children, some initially hesitant to send their offspring to the butcher's block would resort to a compromise, exchanging their emaciated children with one another before selling them off.

Many starving refugees roamed the land like the living dead, drawn to any possible source of food. The signal towers and posts of Shihau were stained with blood, littered with corpses that had been too numerous to collect. The caravan had once passed through a fortress that boasted five hundred clan guards and had purchased a small amount of food for an exorbitant price. A daring and strong-willed youth, envious of one of the caravan's guards wielding a sturdy bow, attempted to strike up a conversation, pointing at a row of shriveled heads displayed on the wooden fence outside the fortress. Squatting down, the boy remarked to one of the caravan’s attendants, “Summer is the worst, attracting mosquitoes and flies, leading to pestilence. But once winter comes and the snow falls, it reduces a lot of troubles.” After saying this, he picked up a stone and threw it at the wooden fence, hitting one of the heads squarely. Clapping his hands, he stole a glance at the caravan attendant, who looked at him with admiration, and the boy felt a swell of pride.

Nearby stood a young woman dressed in blue with a ponytail, capturing the boy's heart. His banter with the caravan attendant was merely an attempt to impress her.

Unfortunately, the blue-dressed lady had not spared him a glance, leaving him feeling dejected. How wonderful it would have been if such a beautiful girl, resembling a deity from a temple mural, were among the desperate refugees! Surely she would survive, and as the clan leader's eldest grandson, he would eventually have his turn, even if it wasn’t immediate. But he also understood that there were no such lovely women among the refugees. The few women he encountered were mostly dark-skinned, their bodies gaunt and skeletal, with skin that was rough and unappealing.

The blue-dressed lady was accompanied by an older woman carrying a sword, but her appearance paled in comparison, especially her figure. If the latter had appeared alone, the boy might have felt a stir of affection, but standing next to the former, all his attention was drawn to the enchanting blue-dressed lady.

The caravan continued its journey southward.

They frequently encountered refugees armed with sharpened sticks attempting to block their path. The smarter ones, or those not yet driven to desperation, would demand food from the caravan in exchange for passage.

The caravan, of course, ignored them, pressing on. Generally speaking, as long as they drew their blades and readied their bows, the refugees would scatter in fear.

Yet some refugees, eyes bloodshot, charged forward, intent on raiding. The caravan guards, seasoned warriors of the Jianghu, were not from Shihau and had become numb to the ongoing violence after losing so many brothers and friends. Deep down, they welcomed the chance to vent their frustrations, so the fierce cavalry struck like a net cast wide, blades flashing, or arrows flying. Hitting the eye was the best, a shot through the neck was second best, while a hit to the abdomen or legs would invite ridicule.

This time, the hired guards and merchants numbered only a dozen.

Aside from the rarely seen blue-dressed ponytailed girl, and a sword-bearing woman missing her right thumb, there was a taciturn young man in black robes. The three seemed to form a close-knit group, often huddling together during rest stops or camping in the wild.

Meanwhile, the leader of the money-hungry merchants was an elderly man clad in a green robe, said to be surnamed Song, and the guards affectionately referred to him as Master Song. He had two attendants: one carried a long, black staff slung across his back, while the other was unarmed, clearly a seasoned Jianghu figure. Both were of similar age to Master Song. Additionally, there were three others who, despite wearing smiles, emanated a cold aura. They were of varying ages; one woman had plain looks, while the other two were a grandfather and grandson pair.

The guards perceived this group of merchants to be quite arrogant, with only Master Song willing to engage in conversation.

That night, they rested at a dilapidated relay station long abandoned, where officials had fled, leaving the place stripped bare.

The blue-dressed ponytailed girl squatted atop a crumbled earthen wall outside the relay station.

Her ever-present companion, the sword-bearing woman, stood below and softly said, “Senior Sister, we have just over half a month’s journey left until we can cross into the territory of Book Lake.”

The blue-dressed girl seemed distracted, responding with a noncommittal “Hmm.”

Master Song slowly emerged from the relay station and lightly kicked the boy squatting on the threshold, before making his way near the wall. The sword-bearing woman immediately greeted him respectfully in the dialect of the Dai Li Kingdom, “Greetings, Master Song.”

The elder smiled and nodded. “Miss Xu, you’re as courteous as ever; you’re being too formal.”

This master was not an apothecary.

The refined elder in the green robe was the chief official of the Ritual Department’s Bureau of Religious Affairs for the Dai Li Kingdom.

In this position, the vassal states like the Huangting Kingdom and Shihau Kingdom were considered relatively minor officials. The Ritual Department had a Deputy Minister and above him, a Minister, so it was possible for someone of equal rank to take over his position at any time. However, in the Dai Li Kingdom, this was a crucial position, one of the three most powerful officials in the dynasty, not particularly high in rank—fifth grade—but wielding immense power. Besides the duties of a Bureau Chief, he also managed the assessment and recommendation of the national mountain and river deities.

Dai Li had never established a river deity for the Changjiang River, but suddenly a water spirit named Li Jin appeared, rising from a humble shopkeeper in Hongzhu Town to become the River God, reportedly through connections with this elder, leaping to high status and enjoying the offerings from across the realm.

The two women were Ruan Xiu and Xu Xiaoqiao, who had left the Longquan Sword Sect to travel.

As for why they had journeyed so far from the Dai Li Kingdom, even Xu Xiaoqiao and Dong Gu found it surprising. As for their senior sister Ruan Xiu, she seemed indifferent.

Seeing that Master Song appeared to have business to discuss, Xu Xiaoqiao took the initiative to step away.

Master Song climbed onto the wall, sitting cross-legged, and smiled. “I must thank Miss Ruan for her understanding.”

Ruan Xiu tucked away a handkerchief into her sleeve and shook her head, murmuring, “No need.”

Master Song smiled and asked, “May I inquire, Miss Ruan, do you not mind, or are you merely tolerating?”

Ruan Xiu questioned, “Is there a difference?”

The elder nodded, adopting a serious tone. “If it’s the former, I won’t press the matter. After all, I’ve been an old man and have experienced the infatuations of youth, so I understand it’s hard for a young man like Li Muxi not to be moved. If it’s the latter, I can certainly give Li Muxi or his grandfather a few words of caution. Miss Ruan need not worry about this being an imposition; this journey south is a task assigned by the court, and there are rules that must be followed. You have done nothing excessive.”

Ruan Xiu replied, “It’s fine; if he wants to look, then let him look. His eyes don’t belong to me.”

Master Song chuckled softly.

Among the group accompanying him, two seasoned Jianghu warriors were by his side—one was a pure warrior temporarily transferred from the Dai Li military, of the Gold Body realm, who had reportedly confronted a notable general face-to-face at the Green Wave Pavilion, cursing and throwing cups, yet still had to deliver the soldier. The other was the leader of a major Jianghu sect, also at the Seventh Realm.

The remaining three were a hastily assembled group of Zhan Gan Lang, among whom the younger was named Li Muxi, a talented cultivator skilled in talismans and formations. He and his grandfather were part of the Zhan Gan Lang, having lost his father recently. Thus, this journey south was both an official matter and an opportunity for personal vengeance for the grandfather and grandson.

This trip to Book Lake had two purposes; one was the overt task, which was substantial. As the chief of the Bureau of Religious Affairs, he was the decision-maker, and the three from the Longquan Sword Sect had to obey his orders.

This autumn, after many years without casualties, two Zhan Gan Lang from Dai Li had suddenly perished—one was a hidden foreign Golden Core cultivator who had secretly taken away a disciple, a special boy who was not only a natural sword embryo but also bore martial luck, catching the attention of several revered martial arts figures.

Dai Li was determined to have him back, and even the national master had heard the news, taking it very seriously.

It was perhaps a case of retribution; absurdly, this boy was first discovered and selected by the Zhan Gan Lang, and for four years, three of them took turns guarding and nurturing him. In the end, the hidden Golden Core cultivator appeared out of nowhere, killing two, and then abducting the boy, fleeing south while evading two assassination attempts and ambushes, proving to be quite cunning and formidable. During his escape, the boy displayed astonishing talent and skill, helping the Golden Core cultivator on two occasions.

Eventually, intelligence from the Green Wave Pavilion indicated that the Golden Core cultivator and the boy had entered Book Lake, after which they vanished without a trace.

Regarding this pursuit, not only the Dai Li Dynasty but all the mountain forces across Baoping Continent would not act foolishly or underestimate the situation. Experienced sects, especially those with a strong foundation, would strive to catch a rabbit with a lion's ferocity, using all their strength to resolve the matter decisively, rather than sending wave after wave of men to die in vain, allowing their enemy to grow stronger through battle.

The adversary was an experienced Golden Core cultivator skilled in combat, holding the advantage of terrain. Thus, Master Song’s party wasn’t simply two Golden Core powers but collectively comparable to a formidable Nascent Soul’s combat strength.

On this point, Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao had conducted several detailed analyses privately, concluding that they could feel somewhat at ease.

Otherwise, if their senior sister made even the slightest mistake, Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao, as founding disciples of the Longquan Sword Sect, would have no reason to remain at Shenxiu Mountain.

As for the other matter that only Master Song was privy to, it was of much greater significance.

It involved the ownership of the entire Book Lake.

He too would need to follow orders in this regard.

Even a certain island lord who had secretly established roots in Book Lake for eighty years was but a pawn.

 ### Chapter 438: Life Is Not a Story in Books (Part Two)

This journey south from the Great Li Dynasty was marked by a small but interesting incident that caught the attention of Doctor Song.

Young Li Muxi found it utterly perplexing to comprehend the sights and sounds encountered during the journey, especially while riding in the carriage towards the Kingdom of Shihau. Deep down, he couldn't help but harbor resentment towards the root cause of his troubles—the Great Li Dynasty itself. In the eyes of the young boy, if the Great Li cavalry hadn't marched south, or if the ensuing battles hadn't been so bloody and cruel, there wouldn't be so many common folk displaced and suffering. Ordinary men and women, once honest and earnest, had been turned into something unrecognizable amidst the turmoil of war.

His grandfather, a "young" cultivator at ninety, remained indifferent to these thoughts and offered no explanations to his grandson.

Ruan Xiu asked, "I heard there’s a child from Mud Bottle Alley who’s at Book Lake?"

Doctor Song nodded. "His surname is Gu. He’s quite the lucky one, taken as a closed-door disciple by the powerful Liu Zhimiao, the Lord of the River, at Book Lake. Gu Can even brought with him a 'Great Mudfish' to Book Lake, accompanied by a dragon-like creature with strength comparable to that of a Nascent Soul. Despite his youth, he has gained significant fame; even the Zhu Ying Dynasty has heard of this master-servant duo. Once, while chatting with Mr. Xu, he jested that this little fellow named Gu Can is a natural-born wild cultivator."

Ruan Xiu raised her wrist to glance at the sleeping Fire Dragon, which resembled a bright red bracelet. She lowered her arm, deep in thought.

———

A middle-aged man arrived at the edge of Book Lake, where a bustling city named Chishui City thrived.

He had hired a carriage for the journey, and the driver was a garrulous old man who had traveled far and wide. The man was generous, enjoying lively conversations and tales, and hardly preferred to sit in the carriage enjoying the ride alone. He spent most of the journey sitting beside the old driver, treating him to plenty of drinks, which brightened the driver's mood. The old man shared numerous intriguing stories he had heard about the eccentricities of Book Lake, asserting that while the rumors from outside were terrifying, the local skirmishes rarely involved ordinary people like them. However, Book Lake was undoubtedly a veritable den of indulgence. He recounted how, in the past, he had transported a group of wealthy young lords from Zhu Ying Dynasty, who boasted that they would stay for a month but returned in less than three days, utterly broke. Those young men had lost sixty thousand taels of silver in mere days, yet they spoke of returning to Book Lake for more fun as soon as they saved up some money.

As the man walked through the bustling streets of Chishui City, he blended in quite easily.

Upon arriving at the city gate, a group of Qi practitioners stood guard, yet no formal passes were required—just a payment sufficed to gain entry.

Chishui City was constructed along the western shore of Book Lake.

Book Lake was vast, dotted with over a thousand islands of varying sizes. The most notable feature was its abundant spiritual energy. Establishing a sect and claiming a significant portion of the islands and waters was no easy feat. However, if one or two Golden Core Earth Immortals claimed a larger island as a residence for cultivation, it would be ideal—tranquil and reminiscent of a small cave paradise. Particularly, practitioners of the "Close to Water" cultivation method regarded some islands in Book Lake as must-have locations.

The sword-wielding man chose a lively tavern in the city and ordered a pot of the city’s signature Wu Ti wine. After finishing his drink and listening to the animated chatter at nearby tables, he gathered one useful piece of information: Book Lake was about to hold its centennial Island Lords’ Council, aiming to elect a new "Ruler of the Jianghu" who had been absent for three hundred years.

After drinking and eating, the man settled the bill with the tavern keeper and left, asking for directions to a street known as Monkey Cry Street, which was open to everyone and lined with various magical shops. The long street stretched for four miles, with Qi practitioners guarding both ends, indifferent to identities and only recognizing silver as the key to passage—much like the old Long City, renowned for its commerce, where wealth dictated status.

If that were the case, it seemed the entire world operated similarly.

With a red wine gourd hanging from his waist, the middle-aged man recalled what the old driver had mentioned. He believed that in the mixed and bustling Book Lake, knowing the common dialect of the region would eliminate worries about communication. However, during the journey, he still picked up some local slang from the old man, enough for basic inquiries and haggling. Strolling about, the middle-aged man neither aimed to impress with grand purchases nor merely window-shopped; he chose a few modest yet appealing magical artifacts, blending in with the typical foreign Qi practitioners, neither looked down upon nor overly praised by the locals.

Eventually, he stopped at a small shop selling antiques and miscellaneous items. The merchandise looked good, but the prices weren't fair. The shopkeeper, a rather cantankerous old man, didn’t seem to have the aura of a good businessman, resulting in a quiet business day. Few customers came and went, and those who dug into their pockets for celestial coins were sparse. The man lingered in front of a bronze sword displayed on a specially crafted stand, captivated by the weapon. The sword’s scabbard was unevenly placed, and its blade bore the small seal "Great Imitation Qu Huang."

Observing the man, who bent low to examine the sword, the old shopkeeper grew impatient. "What are you staring at? Can you afford it? Even an imitation of the ancient Qu Huang sword costs a hefty sum. Go on, if you just want to window-shop, head elsewhere."

The middle-aged man, perhaps lacking in funds and confidence, didn't get angry. Instead, he turned to the old man with a smile, "Shopkeeper, is this Qu Huang the horse of the revered Sage Li and the first monarch of the mortal realm during their travels?"

The shopkeeper glanced at the long sword on the man’s back, his expression slightly softening. "Well, at least you have some discernment. Yes, it is one of the 'Eight Steeds of the Flowing Scattering.' Later, a great swordsmith from the Central Lands devoted his life to creating eight famed swords named after these steeds. This man's temperament was peculiar; while he crafted the swords, he insisted on selling each to the corresponding regional buyers, which resulted in many remaining unsold until his death. There are countless imitations now, but this sword dares to bear the words 'Great Imitation' before Qu Huang, and it’s crafted remarkably well. Naturally, it comes at a steep price. It's been on display in my shop for over two hundred years. Young man, you probably can’t afford it."

The man didn’t pretend to be wealthy. He redirected his gaze from the ancient sword to inspect other curiosities. He eventually stopped in front of a painting of a lady hanging on the wall. The figure depicted was seated sideways, covering her face and weeping. If one listened closely, they could almost hear the faint sounds of sobbing emanating from the painting.

The old shopkeeper exclaimed, "I didn’t expect to meet someone with such taste! You’ve spent the longest time admiring the two finest pieces in my shop. You may not have much money, but your eye for quality isn’t bad. So, have you fallen from grace, wandering the Jianghu after a life of wealth?"

The man continued to study the enchanting painting, recalling that he had heard tales of many paintings from fallen dynasties that contained deep-seated emotions, sometimes giving life to the characters within, allowing them to mourn eternally.

He turned and smiled, "Wandering heroes don’t concern themselves with wealth."

The old man scoffed, "That’s nonsense only someone inexperienced in the Jianghu would say. You look old enough to have wasted your time in the Jianghu, or perhaps you think just hanging around the pond counts as true wandering."

The man remained unruffled. He pointed to the painting of the lady and inquired, "How much for this piece?"

The shopkeeper waved his hand dismissively. "Young man, don't make a fool of yourself."

The man chuckled, "If I can afford it, what would you say about sending me a few inexpensive tokens of good fortune?"

After guarding the family shop for years, the old man felt a spark of enthusiasm and pointed to a display near the entrance. "Alright! See those? As long as you can pay with celestial coins, you can pick three items from that shelf. If I frown, I’ll take your surname!"

The man nodded with a smile.

After hesitating for a moment, the old shopkeeper continued, "That painting of the lady, I won’t go into its background, but you can clearly see its value. Three small summer coins, if you can pay, it’s yours. If not, just leave."

The man glanced at the painting again, then looked back at the shopkeeper, questioning if it was a firm price. The shopkeeper coldly nodded, and the man examined the painting once more, then glanced at the empty shop and the entrance before moving to the counter. He flipped his wrist, revealing three celestial coins on the table, covering them with his palm and sliding them toward the old man. The shopkeeper glanced at the door, and at the moment the man lifted his hand, the old man quickly covered the coins with his hand, pulling them towards himself. After confirming they were indeed genuine summer coins, he grinned and said, "Well, I underestimated you. You’ve got some skills, kid. Even I, with my discerning eye, misjudged you."

The man chuckled helplessly, "Then I’ll go over there and pick three things that catch my eye."

The old shopkeeper laughed heartily, stepping out from behind the counter. "Go on! This is business; a little trust is essential. I’ll wrap up that painting for you. Don’t worry, the box alone is worth two celestial coins. I won’t waste such a precious piece."

As the man scanned the treasures on the shelf, the old shopkeeper carefully took down the painting, placing it in a treasured silk box while keeping a watchful eye on the man from the corner of his eye.

Damn it! Had I known this fellow had such deep pockets and was willing to spend, I wouldn’t have bothered with any tokens of good fortune! And to think he’s picking three items at once—now I feel a twinge of regret.

After the man selected two items, the old shopkeeper felt a bit relieved, realizing he hadn’t lost too much. However, when the man finally chose an ink jade seal that hadn’t been inscribed by any famous artist, the old shopkeeper’s eyelids twitched. "Kid, what’s your surname again?"

The man hesitated for a moment, but at the shopkeeper’s inquiry, he decisively took the seal into his hands and turned to smile, "Chen."

The old shopkeeper looked pitifully at him. "Then I’ll take your surname as Chen from now on. How about returning that seal?"

The man shook his head with a smile. "In business, one must have a bit of sincerity."

The old shopkeeper huffed, "You might as well stop pretending to be a wandering hero and become a businessman. Within a few years, you’ll be rolling in wealth."

Though the old man said this, he was still profiting quite a bit, his mood improving as he poured a cup of tea for the guest named Chen.

The man had no immediate intention of leaving. He pondered whether he could sell the imitation Qu Huang sword and hoped to learn more about the deeper matters of Book Lake from the old shopkeeper, engaging in casual conversation over tea.

He gleaned many insights that the old driver hadn’t shared.

Book Lake was a hidden paradise for wild cultivators, where clever individuals thrived while the foolish found themselves in dire straits. Here, cultivators were not judged by their moral standing but merely by their level of cultivation and cunning.

The bustling commerce and diverse shops offered a plethora of oddities.

Those who found themselves in dire straits elsewhere or faced misfortunes often found refuge here. However, if one sought comfort and ease, they shouldn’t expect to find it. Yet, as long as one had a pig’s head and found the right temple, surviving would not be difficult. How one fared afterward depended on their abilities—aligning with powerful forces and contributing money and effort could also pave a path forward. Throughout Book Lake’s history, there were indeed figures who endured humiliation for years, only to rise and become dominant leaders in the end.

Outside the shop, time flowed slowly.

Inside, the old man was in high spirits.

Once, a Yuan Ying cultivator from a genealogical sect, alongside a Golden Core sword cultivator, perhaps feeling invincible across the entire Baoping Continent, boldly held a grand feast on one of the islands in Book Lake. They invited all the Earth Immortals and Longmen realm cultivators, claiming they would end the chaotic power struggle in Book Lake and become the ruler of the Jianghu.

At the feast, over thirty island lords from Book Lake attended, none opposing the proposal. Some applauded and praised, while others fawned over the idea of having a powerful leader to establish rules, despite a few remaining silent. Following the banquet, some attendees secretly lingered on the island, drafting allegiance statements and scheming, detailing the strengths and vulnerabilities of various factions in Book Lake.

However, the ensuing scenes would later be regarded as particularly satisfying by every cultivator in Book Lake, regardless of age, even centuries later.

That very night, over four hundred cultivators from different islands converged, surrounding the island in question.

Using nearly nine hundred magical treasures and the two hundred death warriors nurtured by their respective islands, they brutally slain the two arrogant Yuan Ying cultivators and the Golden Core sword cultivator.

Interestingly, the ones most determined to kill were precisely those "island lords who first pledged allegiance."

The man listened intently, casually inquiring about Liu Zhimiao, the Lord of the River.

The old shopkeeper grew increasingly animated.

He recounted how Liu Zhimiao had become quite formidable in recent years.

Two years prior, a little devil had emerged as Liu Zhimiao's closed-door disciple. This young boy surpassed his master, riding a terrifying dragon and wreaking havoc in his territory. He had mercilessly slaughtered a prominent guest's household, along with dozens of young courtesans and over a hundred people, leaving behind a scene so gruesome it was unbearable to witness.

Following that, for reasons unknown, he ended up killing his senior disciple, leading to yet another bloodbath. The ferocity of that "Great Mudfish" was evident, as it had attacked not out of necessity but purely for the thrill of killing, leaving a trail of dismembered corpses in its wake.

Afterward, the master and disciple duo surged forth, seizing numerous islands with deeply rooted rival factions nearby.

Those who complied thrived, while those who resisted perished. Many young and beautiful maidens were said to have been forcibly taken by that little devil, becoming courtesans under the tutelage of his second sister.

Since then, peace had eluded Book Lake. Fortunately, it was a godly clash, sparing remote places like Chishui City from the chaos.

That little devil named Gu had since survived several assassination attempts from enemies, growing bolder and more arrogant. His notorious reputation spread widely, and he attracted a large entourage of opportunistic cultivators, earning him the title "Prince of the Lake." This spring, he even made a visit to Chishui City, flaunting a grandeur that rivaled that of a prince from a secular dynasty.

As the old shopkeeper excitedly recounted, the middle-aged man remained mostly silent, lost in thought.

As dusk fell, the old man escorted the man to the shop's entrance, inviting him to return anytime, even if he didn’t purchase anything.

The middle-aged man nodded. As he stood up, he had already tucked the three small items into his sleeve, holding the silk box under his arm as he walked away.

The old man felt a hint of confusion, noticing that the man seemed somewhat... lost? How peculiar! He was clearly a wealthy wanderer—why this demeanor?

Shrugging off his curiosity, the old man shook his head and returned to his shop.

Today’s business was exceptional; it felt like he’d earned enough for three years in a single day. He looked forward to seeing which greedy merchants around the shop would dare to claim they were unsuited for business.

As for whether the man would return to purchase the imitation Qu Huang sword, and why he had started smiling through the tale yet left with a solemn expression, the old shopkeeper didn’t dwell on it.

What did it matter to him? The tales of godly battles at Book Lake, the little devil named Gu, and the cycle of life and death, love and hate—those were just stories belonging to others. We heard them, and that was enough.

After leaving the shop, the guest walked slowly.

Life is not merely a story in books. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are all contained within the pages, yet turning a page is so easy, while mending a heart is so difficult.

Who said that? Cui Dongshan? Lu Tai? Zhu Lian?

I can’t remember.

The middle-aged man paused after walking several dozen steps, sitting down on a step between two shops.

Like a dog by the roadside.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 439: What is Money? Just a Load of Nonsense!

As autumn winds began to rise, the golden crabs were at their plumpest—now was the best time to indulge in the famous golden-clad crabs of Pool Water City. As mealtime approached, the air was filled with a unique aroma that wafted throughout the city.

Some gourmets had even traveled from the far-off Zhu Ying Dynasty, eager to savor these delicacies. They gathered in various luxurious riverside mansions and taverns, clinking glasses in merriment. However, this year, few from the Stone Hair Nation had come to enjoy the feast, as their lives were hanging by a thread.

In just over ten days, the island lords would convene at Shujian Lake to elect a leader of the martial world on the long-abandoned Palace Willow Island. Liu Zhimao, the True Lord of Qingxia Island, was naturally the favored candidate.

Yet here at Shujian Lake, after a lively banquet filled with laughter and camaraderie, over four hundred rogue cultivators were preparing to join forces to hunt down the Nascent Soul and Golden Core sword cultivators in the vicinity.

Recently, rumors had spread through Pool Water City that the infamous Gu Xiaomotou was coming to the city to eat crabs. The young lord of Pool Water City, Fan Yan, had begun spending lavishly to procure the lake's finest golden-clad crabs—specifically the rare “Bamboo Branch” variety, which were enormous and brimming with the essence of water fortune. Ordinary fishermen could only dream of catching one, as only cultivators at the Cave Dwelling stage had a chance of snagging such treasures.

The once-thriving Qingxia Island had seen Liu Zhimao halt its expansion in the past year, akin to a glutton who had overeaten and needed to slow down for digestion. Despite the seemingly favorable situation, it was, in reality, a precarious balance of unstable hearts. Liu Zhimao remained clear-headed about this, rigorously vetting rogue cultivators seeking to ally with Qingxia Island, with the intricate details managed by a female disciple named Tian Hujun.

Once Gu Can's second senior sister, she had now naturally transitioned into the role of the eldest sister, especially after the death of the eldest brother at the hands of the little junior brother, Gu Can. It wouldn’t do to leave that position empty; it would reflect poorly if word got out.

Surrounding Gu Can now was a crowd of distinguished young cultivators and wealthy heirs. Among them was Fan Yan, the young lord of Pool Water City, who was doted upon by his mother and claimed he had no need to fear any earthly gods, only respecting heroes and warriors. 

In short, he was a dimwit.

Almost thirty years old, he still called Gu Can “Big Brother Gu.” The people of Pool Water City often regarded him as a joke.

In addition, there were Qingxia Island’s Fourth Senior Brother, Qin Jue, and Sixth Senior Brother, Chao Zhe—both outstanding cultivators at Shujian Lake, gifted in their talents and ruthless in battle. They were Liu Zhimao's capable lieutenants during his numerous campaigns.

Then there was the young junior brother of Huang Li Island’s master, Lü Caisang, who was hundreds of years younger than his senior brother. Lü was a disciple taken in by an elder before his reclusive retreat, granting him a high standing.

Before Qingxia Island reached its zenith, Huang Li Island was one of the few islands that could vie with it, but it was now far from being a match.

The young lord of Drum Echo Island, Yuan Yuan, was the son of a pair of Golden Core cultivators. His mother was a fierce woman who could even give Liu Zhimao a headache, given her significant background as a former favored concubine of a Nascent Soul sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

There was also Han Jingling, the prince of the Stone Hair Nation, and Huang He, the son of a general.

Gu Can, the wastrel Fan Yan, Qin Jue, Chao Zhe, Lü Caisang, Yuan Yuan, Han Jingling, Huang He, and the elusive Tian Hujun, who loyally followed Gu Can—this group had united as the so-called "Ten Heroes of Shujian Lake."

Notably, even the other eight were puzzled; why did they call themselves ten when there were only nine?

At that time, the little demon Gu Can stood barefoot on the second seat, bouncing around and pointing at the vacant first seat with a grin, saying it was reserved for now.

Despite his youth, Gu Can had grown remarkably during his time at Shujian Lake, transforming from a boy of about ten to a tall youth of fourteen or fifteen years.

Rumors suggested that a peculiar dragon that preferred to feast on Qi cultivators had somehow enhanced Gu Can's physical form. The one assassination attempt that had come closest to success occurred when an assassin struck him hard in the back. Any ordinary person would have perished instantly; even a Qi cultivator of the lower realms would take years to recover. Yet, in less than half a month, the little demon was back, lounging on the head of the dragon he affectionately called “Little Loach,” carefree as he roamed Shujian Lake.

On this day, from the heights of Pool Water City, one could see a massive ship gliding toward Shujian Lake, its size rivaling the city walls.

Surrounding the ship, aside from the waves it stirred, a series of subtle ripples spread across the lake surface, barely noticeable.

A young-looking figure sat barefoot on the ship's railing, swinging his legs. Every so often, he would absentmindedly wipe his nose, which still bore traces of childishness despite his growing stature.

Behind him stood three figures: the eldest sister Tian Hujun, who now wielded considerable power over the lives and deaths of nearly ten thousand people on Qingxia Island and its vassal territories, exuding an air of authority reminiscent of Liu Zhimao. To her left and right stood her two junior brothers, Qin Jue and Chao Zhe.

Following them was a group of ten or so beautiful young women, dressed modestly yet elegantly for their outing.

Beneath the ship, in the depths of the lake, lay a massive “little loach,” several hundred feet long.

At the dock, the young lord Fan Yan had long since taken control, driving away all idle onlookers. Yuan Yuan, the young lord of Drum Echo Island, Lü Caisang, the venerable disciple of Huang Li Island, and Han Jingling, who had sought refuge here for half a year, were gathered, laughing and chatting by the shore. The only one missing was Huang He, the general’s son, who had recently stabbed the emperor of the Stone Hair Nation in the back to ally with the Song Clan’s iron cavalry and was busy trying to install Han Jingling as the new emperor, leaving him unable to attend. He had sent a secret letter to Pool Water City, urging his brother Han Jingling to await good news.

As the silhouette of Pool Water City’s walls grew clearer, Tian Hujun approached the ship's railing and whispered, “Are we really altering the route into the city, deliberately giving those assassins an opportunity?”

The young man crossed his arms and grinned, “What do you think? Do you really believe I came here to eat crabs? I'm about to get sick of these things—they're a hassle to eat! I'd rather have the fried crabs from my hometown's streams. One bite, and they're crispy and delightful—no need for chopsticks. That’s what good food is. You folks at Shujian Lake wouldn’t understand! Just because you have a few coins in your pockets, you think you’re hot stuff. Do you see me carrying silver? Do I need a whole entourage?”

Tian Hujun chuckled, “Little junior brother is indeed a dragon among men; we mere mortals can’t compare.”

The young man leaned back, turned his head, and laughed, “Eldest sister, even if you say nice things, you still lack the looks to be one of those refined women. You're quite unfortunate, really. A common mirror would be a demon-revealing mirror for a plain woman like you.”

Tian Hujun forced a smile, feeling no ill will deep down.

On a quiet little path by the lakeside, a middle-aged man stood beside a withering willow tree, gazing at the ship on Shujian Lake. He picked up a gourd of wine, hesitated, then set it down again, unable to bring himself to drink.

———

As the people of Longquan County grew more familiar with the so-called mountain immortals, some began to ponder the truth behind the miraculous cures. They realized that not every doctor under the sky could concoct pain-free balms to ease suffering during severe illnesses. Especially as more individuals were accepted into the Longquan Sword Sect, even among the exiled convicts of the Lu Dynasty, two children had skyrocketed to become little immortals on Divine Show Mountain.

The Yang family’s pharmacy became bustling with activity. Aunts and uncles alike brought their children to the shop, each one eager to meet the immortal. Of course, Old Yang, who was in charge of the back room, was the prime suspect. This led to the pharmacy nearly shutting down, as the current head of the Yang family felt guilty enough to kneel in apology to Old Yang.

All the visitors were either neighbors from the area or familiar faces from the town, and it was easy to forge connections. Although the Yang family wasn't among the four prominent families or ten major clans in the town, they were still a well-off household. It wouldn’t do to kick people out, and unless they were willing to take drastic measures, it was impossible to drive them away.

If things got out of hand, the pharmacy would simply have to station someone at the door to kindly explain that Old Yang was not some immortal sage but merely an elderly man with a few treasured family recipes.

However, who would believe such nonsense? The more they insisted, the more suspicious people became, and they increasingly viewed Old Yang as a recluse with extraordinary talents.

Fortunately, Old Yang seemed indifferent to it all. He didn’t force the head of the Yang family to close shop; rather, he allowed the pharmacy to spread the word that he could read fortunes and tell fortunes by examining bones, but each consultation would cost a hefty fee—one snowflake coin.

The townsfolk were accustomed to being poor; even those who suddenly found themselves with silver were not the type to throw money around. Some went as far as to sell their pots and pans to gather a thousand taels of silver, while others borrowed from friends who had suddenly become wealthy through selling family heirlooms. However, many chose to wait and see. On the first day, not many brought money to the pharmacy. Old Yang spoke in vague, mystical terms about immortals, but what mattered was that he simply shook his head, finding nothing of interest in anyone.

After fewer visitors began to arrive, the pharmacy announced that they would no longer accept snowflake coins. Instead, if someone bought a bag of medicine from the Yang family pharmacy, they could qualify. After all, everyone in the neighborhood knew each other, and one snowflake coin was indeed a bit pricey.

As a result, the number of visitors plummeted.

Had the Yang family pharmacy lost its mind over money?

Soon, people began to regret their decision and demanded their snowflake coins back, throwing tantrums and resorting to all sorts of tactics.

The pharmacy stood its ground on this issue, refusing to budge. Not a single snowflake coin would be returned, not even a copper coin. In mutual transactions, was there any reason to refund money? Did they think the Yang family pharmacy was a charitable organization?

Everyone hit a wall. Then one day, someone close to the Yang family, drunk, bragged that they had used their connections to get back their “immortal coin.” They claimed that even the staff at the Yang family pharmacy said that Old Yang was merely a fraud who relied on a worn-out book on fortune-telling; the initial rumors had been deliberately spread by the pharmacy to make money.

The uproar was immense.

Overnight, the Yang family pharmacy’s reputation was in tatters, and every member of the Yang family was treated like a street rat, grumbling incessantly and demanding the head of the Yang family to kick that old fraud out of the pharmacy.

The head of the Yang family spoke tirelessly, finally managing to calm the disgruntled family members.

After that, the pharmacy finally found some peace.

It seemed that neither the pharmacy nor Old Yang had anyone willing to come in for fortune-telling anymore, not even if he didn't charge. They were too lazy to entertain anyone unless there was money involved.

As a result, the pharmacy had to replace two staff members: one was a young kiln worker from Qilong Alley, and the other was a child from Taoye Alley. No one seemed to care anymore.

These trivial matters drew the attention of outsiders, while insiders saw the deeper implications, and those destined to cross paths recognized the true way.

A man who had disappeared for several years and just returned to town, Zheng Dafu, had become hunchbacked. He brought no wife back with him, nor any silver. Although he wasn't a staff member, he often sat outside the pharmacy, not stopping anyone but simply watching the commotion, maintaining his usual carefree demeanor. His eyes would often wander toward the chests and backs of the town’s women, earning even more disdain from the local ladies.

Upon returning, Zheng Dafu witnessed this farce and spotted many who had struck it rich, gambling all night, mingling at the newly built brothels, strutting in with confidence and stumbling out with softened legs. 

He also saw men who had amassed so much silver that it was almost impossible to count, standing taller than the old locust tree from years past. Previously timid men who walked through Fortune and Prosperity Street or Peach Leaf Alley without daring to breathe loudly now had the guts to drink with the bosses and discuss the possibility of purchasing one or two well-mannered maids or servants who could read and write. If they could find a young lady, that would be even better. Those who once could only dream of being with an educated woman were now living a life without regrets. In the past, a bag of copper coins made someone feel like a lord, but now silver was treated like a mere trifle!

Money flowed like water, swirling endlessly from hand to hand.

 ### Chapter 440: Where There’s No Hope, There Can Be No Disappointment

The human heart is much the same.

As autumn settled in, Zheng Dafeng found himself in a bit of a funk.

Basking under the warm autumn sun, he glanced down at his lap and felt a wave of despair wash over him. Was he really destined to go from being a dashing young bachelor to an old, lonely one? 

His thoughts drifted unbidden to the street outside the herbal shop, to that girl who claimed her surname was Jiang. Zheng Dafeng shuddered—she was a nice girl, no doubt, but she must have weighed as much as two of him. It didn’t matter how kind she was or how much she wanted to be friends; Zheng Dafeng would rather let his little brother down than betray himself!

While Zheng Dafeng wrestled with his self-doubt and guilt over Jiang, today, Ruan Qiong unexpectedly appeared in the herbal shop's courtyard. Old Yang, for once, wasn’t smoking his pipe; instead, he was soaking up the sun and dozing off. When he finally opened his eyes, he glanced at Ruan Qiong and said, “Well, look who it is.”

Ruan Qiong raised two jars of wine, waving them in greeting.

Old Yang shook his head with a smile. “Not a good idea.”

Ruan Qiong settled on a long bench opposite Old Yang, separated by a small courtyard.

Old Yang asked, “It’s rare to see you looking so troubled, Ruan Sage. What’s on your mind? Worried about Ruan Xiu?”

Ruan Qiong nodded.

Old Yang rarely joked, but today he did. “Is it really that hard to accept Chen Ping’an as a son-in-law?”

Ruan Qiong took a sip from one of the jars. “Chen Ping’an is a decent man. While I might not want him as a disciple, I certainly recognize his character. If Ruan Xiu were just an ordinary girl, I’d let her choose freely. Who knows... I might even enjoy having a drink with that son-in-law from time to time. It wouldn’t be bad at all. Plus, I wouldn’t have to worry about my daughter being wronged; my only concern would be if she became too headstrong and scared him off. But my daughter is Ruan Xiu.”

Old Yang nodded. “Sometimes, when everything seems too perfect, it brings its own troubles. I understand.”

Ruan Qiong drank from his “sorrow wine,” and after a hearty gulp, he wiped his mouth and said, “Since I’ve already had a chat with the Old God, I can glean a bit about Cui Zhan’s plans. However, the specifics of his insidious intentions—how intricately everything is woven together—I can’t quite fathom. This isn’t my forte, and I don’t really want to think about it. But in cultivation, the worst mistake is to get mired down. If Ruan Xiu goes too deep into this mess, trouble is bound to follow. So, I’ve decided to send her to Shujian Lake.”

Old Yang replied, “If you’re willing to throw out the olive branch, someone as clever as Cui Zhan will surely reciprocate. Don’t worry. He’ll handle things beautifully, seamlessly. At the very least, it won’t backfire.”

At this, Old Yang smiled slightly, seemingly recalling something. “Throwing the olive branch and expecting reciprocation—whether it tastes bitter like gall or sweet like syrup depends on the person.”

Ruan Qiong wasn’t one to dwell on such riddles. Aside from perhaps Qi Jingchun, no one stationed in Lizhu Dongtian could predict the Old God’s thoughts, schemes, or desires. Ruan Qiong never engaged in pointless rivalries; he had enough on his plate forging swords and shaping his future, let alone worrying about Ruan Xiu’s path. There wasn’t enough spare time to compete with others.

Old Yang casually returned to the topic at hand. “You want to reach a conclusion by leveraging Gu Can from Mud Bottle Alley, while also using that unknown scheme of the embroidered tiger to create a rift between Ruan Xiu and Chen Ping’an. The more clear-headed they are, the more they’ll get caught in their own stubbornness. Even the tiniest flaw can seem like a mountain, which is why I didn’t stop Ruan Xiu from leaving Longquan County. This is simply you, Ruan Qiong, being a caring father.”

Ruan Qiong couldn’t help but sigh. “Cui Zhan is truly formidable.”

He hoped his daughter Ruan Xiu would not become too entangled in romantic matters, allowing her to focus on her cultivation. He wanted her to ascend to the Fifth Realm as soon as possible and at least have the strength to protect herself.

Just as he was about to doze off, someone handed him a pillow.

Ruan Qiong had no contact with Cui Zhan, nor did Cui Zhan hint at anything.

Everything was Ruan Qiong willingly stepping onto the chessboard, allowing himself and his daughter to become pieces in Cui Zhan’s game.

This was the precision of Cui Zhan’s calculations and predictions about human nature; this was a grandmaster’s ability beyond the board itself.

Old Yang chuckled. “Don’t underestimate the former top disciple of the Sage of Literature. The rules that determined the trajectory of the entire Haoran world’s literary current during the Third and Fourth Struggles were, in part, set by Cui Zhan. You think he’s not impressive? Back then, he was like a startled bird, feeling guilty, dodging and weaving, unable to show his face, which is why he lost the last chance to mend the master-disciple relationship. Of course, this was also a kind of invisible protection from the Sage of Literature. Seeing my top disciple acting like a stray dog, worse off than the Sage himself back in the day, how could you all still dare to cling to him? Didn’t you all shout for compassion? Then let Cui Zhan go like a passing wind. And so, Cui Zhan made his way safely to our Baoping Continent. Ruan Qiong, don’t look at me like that; the Sage of Literature can certainly play the rogue.”

Ruan Qiong smirked. “The convoluted thoughts of scholars probably twist more than all the mountains in Haoran.”

Old Yang laughed. “Add in the Celestial Realm of Daoism, the Lotus Realm of Buddhism, and the Wild Realm of the demon race, and they still wouldn’t compare.”

For the first time, Ruan Qiong found that chatting and drinking with the Old God was much more enjoyable than he had imagined. Perhaps he could come more often? After all, once a daughter grows up, she’s no longer tethered to her father. Even if she stayed nearby, she wouldn’t pay him much mind. Every time he thought of this, he wished he could open a tavern in the small town to avoid having to go to that shop and deal with a townswoman who mocked him.

After Ruan Qiong left, Zheng Dafeng stepped into the courtyard.

As a disciple, the first thing Zheng Dafeng did upon returning to the town was visit his master.

This meeting was the first time in his life that he dared to look Old Yang in the eye and calmly say some outrageous things, like how, even if he were to achieve nothing in life, he could either continue to scrape by at the post station or go back to being a doorman at Chen Ping’an’s Ruined Mountain. He felt no shame in it; a stable life was good enough.

Old Yang just puffed out clouds of smoke, neither praising nor scolding him.

Once Zheng Dafeng had said what was on his mind, he left the back courtyard of the herbal shop. Although he still felt a bit anxious, there was a newfound lightness in his heart.

He found it somewhat amusing; he had been a peak martial artist and had never dared to speak so casually with his master. Old Yang’s words rarely exceeded ten per meeting. Zheng Dafeng had always feared that Old Yang would think he was a lost cause, looking down on him. But after thinking it through, Zheng Dafeng figured it wasn’t so bad; he could stay in the town, dropping by the herbal shop every now and then to see the old man, wondering if the old man would find him bothersome.

Zheng Dafeng entered the courtyard and sat on a bench, not saying anything, intending just to keep Old Yang company for a while before leaving.

Even though he had a lot to say, he knew Old Yang’s temperament all too well. Once he made a decision, not even Zheng Dafeng, nor Li Er, nor anyone else in the world could change his mind.

Old Yang was puffing on his pipe, letting out a smoke ring, and slowly said, “Didn’t you bring a pipe back home? Why did you throw it away? Embarrassed?”

Zheng Dafeng was struck by lightning, and the first thing he did was start counting on his fingers, exclaiming, “Master, you spoke twenty-two words in one go today!”

Old Yang asked, “What’s worth saying by a disciple who doesn’t even dare look his master in the eye? Back then, did you even deserve it?”

Zheng Dafeng sat up straight. “I let my master down.”

Old Yang’s next words were as sharp as ever. “If there are no expectations, how can there be disappointment?”

Eight words.

This was the most normal exchange between master and disciple Zheng Dafeng had before leaving his hometown.

He didn’t feel wronged at all; in fact, he was quite happy. With these eight words, his master had already spoken thirty words today. He would surely brag about it to Li Er when he saw him!

Old Yang tossed something his way; it was the pipe Zheng Dafeng had secretly discarded outside the town. Zheng Dafeng caught it and discovered it was even filled with tobacco.

Old Yang said, “I’ll ask you one thing: do other people deserve to be calculated against by Cui Zhan?”

Zheng Dafeng sighed, rubbing his fingers together to light the tobacco. He still had that much skill.

Old Yang continued, “If Chen Ping’an hadn’t shattered his life’s porcelain, he would have had the potential of an Earth Immortal—not bad, just not outstanding. Now that his heart is broken, he’s lost his future as a Qi Practitioner. However, he still has the path of martial arts available. Worst case scenario, he becomes a disillusioned yet stable wealthy man living on Ruined Mountain. What’s so bad about that?”

Both master and disciple were puffing clouds of smoke when Zheng Dafeng suddenly said, “That’s not good.”

Old Yang scoffed. “Oh?”

Zheng Dafeng looked up, gathering his courage. “He is Chen Ping’an!”

Old Yang tapped his pipe on the steps and casually remarked, “The real key to choosing Chen Ping’an was a single word from Qi Jingchun. That’s what swayed that existence to gamble on him. Do you really think it’s his talent, character, or fate?”

Zheng Dafeng countered, “Would Qi Jingchun choose Ma Ku Xuan or Xie Jialong Mei to convince that existence? I doubt Qi Jingchun would even dare to suggest it! According to Chen Ping’an’s theory, to understand a result, you have to backtrack step by step. Qi Jingchun’s words were indeed crucial, but can we really ignore Chen Ping’an’s talent, character, and fate? When I step outside, I realize even more that the world out there believes in suffering more than the common folk of our town. As long as someone receives a reward, it’s no longer suffering. Those long agonies endured by people in hardship, their emotional ups and downs, are nothing compared to a realm, a treasure, a flying sword, or a chance.”

Old Yang chuckled, his gaze icy. “Those fools don’t deserve to be on our lips. How can you even converse with a bunch of ants fighting for scraps? Are you going to crouch down and talk to them? It seems your journey has only set you back.”

Zheng Dafeng grinned, quickly changing the subject. “Master, you’ve bet quite a lot on Chen Ping’an. Aren’t you worried about losing everything?”

Old Yang shook his head. “If I have poor judgment and lose in business, I have no one to blame but myself.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 441: Autumn Hunting

Zheng Dafeng sighed.

He felt he had done all he could for Chen Ping'an. Continuing to nag him would likely backfire.

Old Yang glanced at the slightly dazed hunchbacked man and spoke bluntly, "Cui Zhang’s ambitions and the knowledge he’s hidden away have given me many valuable insights. I racked my brain for nearly nine thousand years trying to break through my bottleneck, achieving little. Yet, after just two discussions with Cui Zhang, I gained more than I did in all those years. This unexpected benefit, I must return to Cui Zhang."

"So even if I lose everything I bet on Chen Ping'an, it doesn’t matter much."

Zheng Dafeng asked, "Master, I'm curious—among all your disciples, is there anyone who makes you especially happy or sad? For example, with Senior Brother Li Er likely on the verge of reaching the 'Divine Arrival' in the tenth realm, would you feel satisfied?"

Old Yang shook his head. "No."

Zheng Dafeng pointed to himself, grinning. "What about me? My situation is this dire, and you feel no sorrow at all?"

Old Yang could only respond with a smirk.

Zheng Dafeng's eyes grew forlorn. "Master, although I was prepared for it, actually learning the answer still makes me a bit sad."

Old Yang, tired of this student’s chatter, suddenly said, "To survive, and then to live better, one must contend with the world. The ignorance of youth, the fervor of passion, the bravery of ordinary men, the righteousness of chivalry, the arrogance of scholars, the loyalty of generals, the reckless gambling of tyrants—these can all lead one forward, unburdened by guilt. But some people insist on wrestling with themselves. How do you untangle the knots you’ve tied yourself into?"

"Today’s cultivators find it hard to refine their hearts. This is a restraint we set for them back then, the reason they’re worse than ants. However, at that time, we didn’t foresee that this so-called 'chicken rib' would become what Cui Zhang refers to as 'a spark'. Forget it. This human heart is as murky as a climber's journey with a soaking wet garment, weighing them down as they traverse a hundred miles, feeling half of it is like climbing ninety. In the end, how does one wring it dry to continue their ascent? This is a profound study. Yet, no one anticipated these ants could actually reach the summit. Of course, some might have foreseen it but, for the sake of immortality, they didn’t care, mistakenly believing that these ants could reach the peak and glimpse the celestial mansions. Even if they sprouted wings, there’s still a long way to go to truly ascend to the heavens, and at that point, a casual stomp could end them. Originally, the plan was to fatten up for the autumn hunt and enjoy a good feast. In fact, after countless years, things remain stable. The decay of countless divine bodies has slowed, and the four corners of heaven and earth keep expanding, but you’ve already seen how it ends."

At this point, Old Yang spoke without much bitterness or sorrow, as if he were an outsider revealing the greatest secret of the universe.

Zheng Dafeng cautiously asked, "Why don’t the three teachings’ saints eradicate you, Master?"

Old Yang chuckled. "You asking such a significant question now, does it even matter? Shouldn’t you be pondering how to remain single instead?"

Zheng Dafeng laughed. "So Master can make jokes too."

Old Yang, for the first time, exhibited a hint of helplessness, his wrinkled face becoming even more creased. "It’s all because of that detestable wife of Li Er, constantly nagging."

Zheng Dafeng asked softly, "What about Sister-in-law?"

Old Yang scoffed, "If she were, would I not make her live worse than a pig or dog for eternity? It’s just because she’s a troublesome commoner that I don’t hold it against her."

Zheng Dafeng felt relieved.

Old Yang said, "Gu Can to Chen Ping'an is like Chen Ping'an to Qi Jingchun. It precisely represents the deadlock of a dead end."

Zheng Dafeng frowned. "Gu Can and Chen Ping'an have completely different temperaments, don't they?"

He shook his head repeatedly. "No, it’s different, it's different."

Old Yang smiled. "If you don’t speak of good and evil, looking back, isn’t it really different?"

Zheng Dafeng fell into contemplation.

His eyes gradually grew resolute.

Old Yang shook his head. "Don’t meddle in this; even if you, Zheng Dafeng, are already a tenth realm martial artist, it won’t matter. This situation, unrelated to killing or life and death, is one where even the Sage of Literature cannot assist Chen Ping'an if he wishes. This has nothing to do with knowledge or cultivation level. The divine positions accompanying the Confucian Temple have been shattered, but the roots of the Sage’s learning still remain. The Sage can certainly use immense knowledge to temporarily overshadow Chen Ping'an’s current understanding and subdue that malevolent creature in his heart, but in the long run, it will backfire and could endanger Chen Ping'an."

Old Yang glanced at the sky. "That guest from the Lu Sect could help Chen Ping'an walk down a different path, but Chen Ping'an himself wouldn’t agree."

"And one thing Chen Ping'an guessed right: that Lu Sect master is fixated on the Chen Ping'an selected by Qi Jingchun, not Chen Ping'an himself. So once his mind wavers and he’s lured away to Bai Yujing, the best outcome is becoming a puppet, a possibility for the eleventh and twelfth realms. The worst outcome? He might never escape the Lu Sect master’s grasp, destined to be an observer of the Dao."

Zheng Dafeng nodded. "It’s like a man who yearns for a woman he cannot have— the more he cannot have her, the more beautiful she seems. Once he possesses her, she’s just... the same."

Old Yang unexpectedly commented, "There are quite a few brothels in the town nowadays."

Zheng Dafeng’s face flushed. "Master, I’m just being playful! I’m not really like that!"

Old Yang asked what seemed to be a completely unrelated question. "What do the four plaques hung at Crab Alley, belonging to the three teachings, say?"

Zheng Dafeng replied, "The Confucians’ 'Taking the Initiative,' the Daoists’ 'Natural Wisdom,' the Buddhists’ 'Seek Not Outside,' and the Martialists’ 'Fighting Spirit.'"

Old Yang smiled and urged, "Think carefully."

After contemplating for a moment, Zheng Dafeng said, "Taking the Initiative is one of the key deadlocks in Chen Ping'an’s predicament..."

Old Yang chuckled. "The Daoists’ quest for the Way, merging with heaven and earth—isn’t that wonderful? That’s why I say the Lu Sect master’s teachings can save Chen Ping'an temporarily throughout his life, ignoring the world, and care not for the life or death of a mere boy from Mud Bottle Alley. The Sage of Literature accused that Lu Sect master of being blind to heaven due to humanity, but in my view, it’s not so; early on, while seeking the Dao on land in the Haoran world, the Lu Sect master may have been that way, but once he set sail, he began to change. He truly started to forget his form and aligned himself with the Way, becoming the favorite disciple of the Dao Ancestor. As for that Buddhist phrase, which seems to offer Chen Ping'an a potential solution to his predicament, it’s actually not so. Cui Zhang must have anticipated it and already devised a countermeasure. As for the Fighting Spirit..."

Zheng Dafeng lowered his voice, "What about her?"

Old Yang maintained a stoic expression. "Her? She doesn’t care at all. Perhaps she wishes for Chen Ping'an to be more decisive. As long as he doesn’t die, even if he walks into an extreme, she would be pleased."

Zheng Dafeng scratched his head. "So in the end, it looks like Chen Ping'an is doomed?"

Old Yang laughed. "In the end, you’ll be a wealthy man guarding the mountain, while you watch over his gate, living off his excess. Isn’t that good?"

Zheng Dafeng suddenly looked up, staring intently at Old Yang. "Master intends for Chen Ping'an to confront the malevolent creature within him to temper his sword heart, to stop dwelling on those restrained moralities, so that he feels the vastness of heaven and earth, believing that his sword is the only truth in hand— to help that existence cast aside the earlier Chen Ping'an, the sword sheath. Am I right?!"

Old Yang smiled. "To think you could come to this conclusion shows you’ve made some progress."

Zheng Dafeng trembled as he asked, "Is this what she wanted?"

Old Yang shook his head, revealing a hint of nostalgia and emotion. He murmured, "Why would she care about that? She really doesn’t. She... is who she is."

Zheng Dafeng looked solemn. "It’s tragic; truly tragic."

He recalled the young man sitting across from him in the dusty apothecary, munching sunflower seeds and smiling at the people in the courtyard.

He always felt that after enduring such a devastating calamity, that young man should be able to enjoy a few days of comfort and ease.

Little did he know that since leaving Old Dragon City, an even more terrifying trap awaited Chen Ping'an than the Ascension realm’s Du Mao and the life-consuming Sword Boat.

Autumn had arrived.

The autumn hunt had begun.

Old Yang spoke nonchalantly, "Now, as chaos descends upon the Haoran world, one day those who refuse to speak of reason—those foolish ones who think knowing the truth is futile, using reason to serve their selfish desires—will see the fundamental truths revealed. Not eating will lead to death; not drinking will lead to death even faster. When that time comes, the value of those willing to speak of reason will become clear. Fortunately, people's memories aren't good. After suffering pain, they quickly forget. The world keeps turning in cycles; it’s been ten thousand years, and it hasn’t improved much."

Zheng Dafeng trembled. "Improved? How has it improved?"

Old Yang laughed. "Am I even human?"

Zheng Dafeng had no retort.

Old Yang then asked, "Are you human?"

Zheng Dafeng remained silent.

Finally, Zheng Dafeng left the shop, passing through Mud Bottle Alley, passing by Chen Ping'an's ancestral home and Gu Can's ancestral home.

Old Yang remained alone in the courtyard, inhaling and exhaling clouds of smoke.

A millennia ago, a cluster of divine light adorned the heavens, grand and resplendent, with stars shining brightly.

Meanwhile, the inconsequential human nature below was merely a flicker of sparks— how had it triumphed?

Cui Zhang provided the answer.

Old Yang was reluctant to admit it, yet he had to.

And the one capable of providing that answer was probably in some corner of Book Scroll Lake right now.

————

At the top of a tall building in Pool Water City, a door opened to reveal a white-clothed youth with a mole on his forehead sitting next to an elderly scholar in Confucian robes, both gazing at the magnificence of Book Scroll Lake outside.

Cui Dongshan, Cui Zhang.

The two of them, once one person, the Master of the Great Li Nation, and the former first disciple of the Sage of Literature.

Cui Dongshan's expression was solemn as he wielded a flying sword, Golden Spike, around himself, drawing a small thunder pool to remind himself that no matter what happened, he must not step outside that circle.

Cui Zhang glanced at Cui Dongshan and smiled. "No wonder you and your student both enjoy drawing boundaries."

Cui Dongshan gritted his teeth. "I admit I lost, but don’t take advantage of your strength and turn your back on our agreement!"

If it weren't for this old rascal forcibly setting up this situation and not giving him any chance to refuse, Cui Dongshan would never have rejoined the gambling table. His hatred for the term "Big Brother" was deep-rooted, and he absolutely refused to bet on a large win again.

But the old rascal wouldn’t agree; what could Cui Dongshan do?

Conversely, if Cui Dongshan were in Cui Zhang's position, he felt he would do the same.

How could he not understand himself?

This gamble between Cui Dongshan and Cui Zhang was simple: to determine a hierarchy, nothing more, with no life-and-death stakes involved.

That’s also why Cui Dongshan didn’t want to throw caution to the wind; he was all too aware of his own limits, more than anyone else.

If Cui Zhang lost, he would be allowed to exist in the Great Sui as a sort of feudal lord, and not just him— the entire Great Li Song clan would place their bets on Chen Ping'an. Chen Ping'an was worth that price. The last time Cui Zhang met him, he jokingly said, "If even I think it’s a deadlock, and if Chen Ping'an can break it, he naturally deserves my admiration." Such a being must not be casually eliminated; instead, they should be ardently courted. What shame could there be in that?

If Cui Dongshan lost, he would have to leave the mountain, departing from the Cliffside Academy, to assist Cui Zhang in strategizing against the Zhu Ying Dynasty, and after bypassing the Guanhua Academy, he would manage the logistics of the Great Li’s cavalry. Alternatively, he could suppress various factions south of the Great Li and north of the Guanhua Academy, quickly digesting the foundational essence of half of Treasure Bottle Continent into the true inner strength of the Great Li.

Cui Dongshan would also have to obediently return to the path of merit, becoming the foundational disciple of Cui Zhang's merit doctrine.

Why did that celestial ferry from the Qing Luan Nation dawdle? Why were there no direct ferries to Book Scroll Lake from Old Dragon City, Qing Luan Nation, or Huang Ting Nation? Why was Chen Ping'an refining his second life-bound object at the Great Sui Academy? Why did Longquan County suddenly commence a new round of mountain trading?

It was all to prepare for Book Scroll Lake, where everything was ready— even the east wind was not lacking.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 442: Please Enter the Jar

However, throughout this process, everything must align with the larger trends of the continent, be reasonable and justifiable. It is not that Cui Zhan is forcibly orchestrating things; rather, under the direct supervision of Cui Dongshan, Cui Zhan makes each move carefully, ensuring that every step is not unreasonable.

The Great Li has already secretly infiltrated Shujian Lake and is now quietly tightening its net.

As a critical region adjacent to the Zhulian Dynasty, Shujian Lake has long been viewed as a prize by the national teacher of the Great Li.

The River-Blocking True Monarch, Liu Zhimao, aims to unify Shujian Lake. Once the lake is under his control, who will he hand it over to? Naturally, it will be sold to the imperial family at an exorbitant price.

Yet, this imperial family is quite distant from Shujian Lake. They will likely sell it again, but to whom? It will be to the Jade Gui Sect of Tongye Continent. The Jade Gui Sect plans to select a prime location on Baoping Continent as the foundation for their new branch. They have already identified three potential sites: one in Longquan County, which would be split between Ruan Qiong and the Jade Gui Sect; another near the Jiang clan of Yunlin and the Qingluan Kingdom; and the last one is Shujian Lake.

Liu Zhimao is a man of ambition. Over the years, his sharp maneuvers and alliances, combining both kindness and severity, have already positioned him as a dominant figure in Shujian Lake. With the assistance of the Great Li’s cultivators, he is hopeful of sealing the deal once and for all.

Ideally, Ruan Xiu, who stands opposed to Gu Can, should wait until the latest king of the martial world is elected, following a series of treacherous battles.

But it doesn’t matter.

Ruan Xiu was never in the game in the first place; her presence is inconsequential, merely icing on the cake.

Originally, Chen Ping’an was supposed to arrive at Longquan County, happily buy a couple of mountain peaks, practice his fist techniques in the bamboo house of the Fallen Mountain, and chat with the two little ones, enjoying the warmth of companionship.

Then, he would suddenly hear of tragic news from Shujian Lake—a great melee had erupted, drawing the young Gu Can deep into its chaos, exerting a significant influence.

After that, Chen Ping’an would urgently board a celestial ferry “passing by” Niu Jiao Mountain, leveraging Wei Ban’s private connections and spending a fortune on divine currency to dare cross over the skies of Baoping Continent, arriving at Shujian Lake.

By that time, the situation would be even more complex and difficult to decipher.

Because there would be more deaths.

And perhaps, Ruan Xiu would be among them.

Cui Zhan smiled and said, “It still doesn’t matter; the larger situation is set. Let’s say I’m too soft-hearted to strike down Cui Dongshan outright, to spare you a lengthy journey of changing paths, which would delay the trends of Baoping Continent.”

His gaze shifted to a small path by the lakeside as he smiled and said slowly, “You, Chen Ping’an, stand by your principles and wish to reason with everyone in every situation. Do you intend to be a Buddhist hermit? If so, go ahead!”

“The principles you believe in do not distinguish between closeness and distance. So when the person closest to you, someone you care about, commits a grave mistake, a monstrous error, and yet that person seems to have their own reasons, what will you, Chen Ping’an, do then? Will your steadfast principles still hold any weight? I’m quite curious; I’m looking forward to it.”

“Or will you seek out some convoluted literary phrases or so-called cautionary maxims to find a few principles you desire?”

Cui Zhan squinted, “You and I can wait and see.”

Cui Dongshan sneered, “A gentleman can be easily deceived by a mere facade.”

Cui Zhan continued, “That trial in the small town, for you, Chen Ping’an, was filled with external temptations and lacked purity, which is why we suffered such heavy losses. Ultimately, I underestimated a boy from a back alley. Since he was chosen by Qi Jingchun, we should have been more cautious back then. Hence, this current trial should only question one’s true heart.”

Cui Dongshan was not being kept in the dark by Cui Zhan; the old bastard wasn’t secretly plotting against him. In fact, Cui Zhan had been straightforward with him every step of the way.

The more this was the case, the more Cui Dongshan felt like he was waiting for his doom.

So when Chen Ping’an and the four from the scroll arrived in the Qingluan Kingdom, Cui Dongshan could no longer sit still. He couldn’t bear to watch himself become a pawn of that old bastard.

Thus, he abruptly appeared in that serene little village.

From then on, until Chen Ping’an reached the Cliffside Academy, Cui Dongshan had cheated a couple of times.

Once was when he “naturally” borrowed the Buddhist discourse of the Qingluan Kingdom to discuss Legalist philosophy. During that farewell, he secretly gave a silk bag to Pei Qian, inside which was a note with a single line written on it.

The second time was during their reunion at the Cliffside Academy, where he urged Chen Ping’an to read the “classics” of the three teachings and the hundred schools, but his real intention was to secretly recommend those few Buddhist classics to Chen Ping’an.

If breaking this situation was a luxury, then at least, stepping back a thousand paces, he hoped to help Mr. Chen Ping’an preserve his own Dao heart. Cui Dongshan knew he was struggling hard and offered two possibilities.

One was the Legalist perspective, where right and wrong are determined by law, with no distinctions of closeness or distance.

The other was the Buddhist perspective, which speaks of cause and effect, where all beings suffer; yesterday’s causes lead to today’s effects. The various misfortunes suffered by innocent people today stem from past lives’ transgressions—“it is only reasonable.”

Actually, Cui Dongshan’s cheating had another, even more subtle instance.

Right there in the courtyard of the Cliffside Academy, it was the most ingenious of all.

At this moment, Cui Zhan gazed at the slowly approaching ferry from Qingxia Island, smiling and saying, “You’ve cheated twice; I can pretend not to see. I’ll pressure you with the larger situation, and it’s unavoidable that you’ll feel disgruntled, so what if I let you have two moves?”

Cui Dongshan smiled brightly, “You old bastard, such a generous tone! I like it, I like it! How about letting me have another move, since three is a charm?”

Cui Zhan looked at the ferry, “Haven’t I let you already? I’m just saying it out loud because I’m worried that little brat’s face won’t be able to hold up.”

Cui Dongshan’s expression soured.

Cui Zhan muttered to himself, “You deliberately entice the two lively children in that Donghua Mountain courtyard to scribble on your celestial scroll, and then you intentionally scare Pei Qian with a summer illustration of a skeleton, letting your temper overshoot. Sure enough, that brought about Chen Ping’an’s reprimand. I bet his performance must have pleased you, right? Because he traveled such a long way but didn’t get too hung up on the dead doctrines of the books, realizing that a gentleman must bend and stretch, and also understanding what it means to ‘when in Rome, do as the Romans do.’ You, Cui Dongshan, wouldn’t care about those scrolls, as they seem worthless in your eyes. Plus, since Chen Ping’an treats you like family, why should he talk about the underlying principles of order with you, when it’s clear that Pei Qian and Li Huai were at fault first? Because this is called adapting to the situation; worldly principles must align with those who are ‘not wrong.’ Your intention is merely to make Chen Ping’an ponder deeply about why Gu Can has become a ruthless killer in this Shujian Lake realm, and if there might be a hint of justification in it. Is it possible that the world is such that Gu Can’s faults aren’t as severe as they seem?”

Cui Dongshan’s expression grew serious.

Cui Zhan smiled and said, “But is this really useful? Do you truly think this move of yours is brilliant? Wrong. For the boy from Mud Bottle Alley back then, it was indeed clever, but for today’s Chen Ping’an, who already has principles weighing him down like a ballast, it only adds fuel to the fire, making him think even deeper, ultimately leaving him more lost. Cui Dongshan, at this point, can’t you see the real fun in this game I’m playing?”

Cui Zhan maintained a calm demeanor, never once turning to look at Cui Dongshan, nor adopting an aggressive stance. “What’s so interesting? It’s all in the timing. The complexity of principles lies precisely in the fact that one can discuss adapting to the local customs, which may or may not matter. Principles can be discussed or ignored, the laws of one region and one’s own principles can be muddled together. Shujian Lake is a lawless land; secular laws don’t apply, and the teachings of sages don’t matter either. Even many rules established among the islands of Shujian Lake become irrelevant. Here, big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp, and people eat people; humanity disregards humanity, everything is settled by brute force. Almost everyone is caught up in the killing, and no one is exempt.”

“All these can serve as legitimate reasons for Chen Ping’an to ‘take a step back for inner peace.’ All these are the leeway I deliberately provide him. I’ve given him countless possible choices; the great path and the divergent routes lay before him, with no one stopping him. In this way, I want him to truly feel that perhaps there really are no absolute principles in this world. I want him to be forced to deny himself for the sake of Gu Can, to accept the chaotic theory of the world that claims only positions matter, not right or wrong.”

Cui Zhan smiled, “A good man, faced with a world that believes in brute force and only speaks of reason in words, will end up hurt and bound, painting himself into a corner. I want to see how you, Chen Ping’an, will discuss disappointment and hope in the end.”

Cui Dongshan smiled bitterly, “Indescribably wonderful, truly wonderful.”

Cui Zhan then spoke, piece by piece, like knives stabbing into Cui Dongshan’s heart.

“Gu Can’s mother, that bowl of grace from back then, Chen Ping’an believes she saved your life.”

“You have feelings for Gu Can that rival those for Liu Xianyang, treating Gu Can as your own brother.”

“Even that loach was something you personally handed over to Gu Can back in the day.”

“Since you, Cui Dongshan, have secretly employed Buddhist principles to save Chen Ping’an, can you truly save him? Isn’t Chen Ping’an the one who believes in not seeking outward as stated on that archway? The cause and effect of those wrongfully dead can be explained, but once you flee from Zen and seek a Buddhist peace of mind beyond Confucian reasoning, the question comes: do you want to grasp that earliest cause associated with you? Can you even see it?”

“If Chen Ping’an pretends not to see, it’s fine; because he has effectively lost that pure heart Qi Jingchun treasured most. You and I, the outcome is already determined.”

“If he truly can’t see, that’s fine; I’ll find someone to remind him.”

Cui Zhan concluded with a final remark, his tone casual, yet devoid of excessive joy. “This time, no one can save him—not even Chen Ping’an himself.”

Cui Dongshan sat silently beside him, not saying a word.

Cui Zhan finally turned his head, smiling, “A young man should be full of vigor. Why do you seem even more exhausted than I am now?”

Cui Dongshan closed his eyes, tears streaming down his face, softly murmuring, “May your heart remain serene, as springtime in all four seasons, springtime in all four seasons…”

The ferry by the lakeside had already docked, and that “middle-aged man” named Chen, under the drooping yellow leaves of a willow tree, hesitated after putting away his wine jug.

He was seventeen this year.

Cui Zhan stood up, extending a hand with a smile, “Please enter the jar!”

 ### Chapter 443: Some Reunions Are the Worst (Part 1)

The towering ship slowly docked, so immense that Fan Yan, Yuan Yuan, and Lu Cai Sang, who were waiting at the pier, had to crane their necks to see.

At the bow, Gu Can, dressed in a dark green python robe, leaped down from the railing. His senior sister, Tian Hu Jun, naturally stepped forward to smooth out the creases in his robe. Gu Can glanced at her and said, “You don’t need to disembark today.”

Tian Hu Jun’s face was full of worry. “That group of assassins lurking in Water Pool City are said to be sword cultivators from the Zhu Ying Dynasty. They shouldn’t be taken lightly. With me here…”

Gu Can laughed, “What’s the use of you being here? Are you really going to die for me if there’s a life-threatening situation? Since that’s impossible, don’t flatter me on such matters. Do you think I’m a fool? Look at this—having you smooth out my robe is within your capabilities, and you’re willing to do it. I benefit, and it’s all good.”

Tian Hu Jun’s eyes dimmed, and she no longer insisted.

Qin Jue and Chao Zhe exchanged knowing smiles.

Their junior brother Gu Can was definitely not someone to be regarded as just a child.

Their shared master, the True Lord of the River, Liu Zhi Mao, had once joked at a celebration feast that only Gu Can truly inherited his teachings.

Liu Zhi Mao had even looked around the hall with a sinister smile, declaring that the future lord of Qingxia Island would only be Gu Can, and no one else should think of contesting for it. Otherwise, he wouldn’t need Gu Can to do anything; he’d take matters into his own hands and clear out the competition, ensuring no corpses would go to waste.

At that time, Gu Can had been lounging on an exceedingly wide chair, his feet resting on a “mud loach” that had revealed its true form but had shrunk considerably. Upon hearing those words, Gu Can had laughed heartily, raising a cup of sweet fruit wine. “Master, let’s drink!”

The only ones to disembark were Gu Can, his two senior brothers Qin Jue and Chao Zhe, along with two young women in open gowns, their faces hidden under veils, their figures graceful and enticing.

Fan Yan, the young lord of Water Pool City, was a tall, handsome man who could only be described as a pretty face with little substance. He hurried forward to greet Gu Can and his companions, bowing and clasping his hands in a flattering manner. “Big Brother Gu, didn’t you say last time that eating crabs was too troublesome? This time, I’ve put in some effort to select a…”

At this point, Fan Yan’s face broke into a playful smile as he gestured with his hands in front of his chest, “This kind of young lady, let’s agree beforehand—if Big Brother Gu doesn’t take a liking to her, she’ll just help you pick crab meat. But if you do find her appealing and want to take her back to Qingxia Island as a maid, you must remember to credit me for this. You don’t know how much effort I expended to bring her from Shihau Country to Water Pool City! I spent a fortune!”

Gu Can chuckled, “You don’t mean to say that the girl who might get close to me has actually been swapped out for an enemy sent to assassinate me, do you?”

Fan Yan was stunned into silence, “What should I do then? Have I wasted so much silver?”

Yuan Yuan, who had hitched his fortunes to the right star, laughed in schadenfreude.

Lu Cai Sang, who had once been a little troublemaker on the shores of Book Letter Lake before Gu Can arrived at Qingxia Island, genuinely looked down on the foolish Fan Yan. He was merely a money pit, one who would hold a grudge against anyone who hindered his spending. No one was unhappy about it; all the island lords around Book Letter Lake needed a few moneybags who enjoyed spending more than earning. Moreover, Water Pool City was one of the three major cities surrounding Book Letter Lake, so they indeed had money to spare.

Lu Cai Sang, a slender and handsome youth dressed in white, had once jokingly remarked that with just a touch of rouge, he could easily pass as one of Gu Can’s open-gown maidens, though he would need to carry two large buns with him for it to work. The result was an explosion of anger from Lu Cai Sang, who nearly killed a martial arts master who had desperately shielded Huang He, the son of a general from Shihau Country. However, Gu Can managed to calm him down, but it was evident that Lu Cai Sang’s relationship with Huang He had soured. Afterward, Huang He, regretting his previous actions, sought various ways to mend their relationship, but Lu Cai Sang had refused to give him the chance.

Lu Cai Sang whispered to Gu Can, “Can, don’t worry. I’ve checked her out; she’s just a low-level cultivator. But she’s really quite attractive and has a good reputation in Shihau Country. The women in the courtyard of Qingxia Island are nothing compared to her; they’re just a bunch of vulgar beauties.”

Gu Can lightly kicked Lu Cai Sang’s leg, laughing as he scolded, “Have you lost your mind? Why would you go out of your way and ruin my surprise?”

Lu Cai Sang rolled his eyes at Gu Can, a hint of flirtatiousness in his gaze, which left Qin Jue and Chao Zhe feeling somewhat bewildered but not daring to show it.

Though they were all among the ten heroes of Book Letter Lake, everyone knew exactly how much weight each of them carried. For example, Huang He had once misjudged his relationship with Lu Cai Sang, thinking they could be close friends, only to end up with a face full of disappointment. It was said that when he returned to his father’s estate, he initially complained and sought sympathy, only to be scolded mercilessly by his father.

Yuan Yuan, the young lord of Huang Li Island, whose nickname was “Round,” glanced around, puzzled. “Gu Can, where’s your big mud loach? Isn’t it coming ashore with us? We’ve walked the roads of Water Pool City last year; it should be enough for the big loach to pass through.”

Gu Can tucked his hands into the sleeves of his python robe, smiling cheerfully. “The little loach is staying in the lake this time, not tagging along to Water Pool City for the fun. It needs to wander around more and drink plenty of water because last year it ate too many qi cultivators and directly absorbed the essence of the water transport that had accumulated over hundreds of years from two large islands. So this year, it’s often in seclusion at the bottom of the lake. Here’s some good news—I’m only sharing this secret with you because we’re brothers, so remember not to spread it! The little loach will soon be a real Nascent Soul (Yuan Ying) level being. By then, even my master, the True Lord of the River, wouldn’t be a match for the little loach. Hmm, perhaps only that old guy from Gong Liu Island who left many years ago would have the qualifications to duel with it.”

Fan Yan stared blankly. “Big Brother Gu, you promised me that whenever you were happy, you’d let me touch the little loach’s head so I could boast about it. Is that still valid?”

Gu Can tilted his head, looking at this fool, realizing that there are indeed simpletons in the world. It had nothing to do with whether someone was rich or poor, nor with how clever their parents were. Gu Can smiled and said, “Of course it counts. Why wouldn’t it? When have I, Gu Can, ever gone back on my word?”

Fan Yan beamed, dancing in delight.

As a result, Gu Can kicked him in the groin. “What a waste of such a big frame, and yet your bird is so small.”

Fan Yan bent over, clutching his groin, still not angry. He pleaded, “Big Brother Gu, don’t do this! My parents can say anything, but they absolutely won’t allow me to fool around when it comes to continuing the family line! The last time you taught me that line, saying how heroes of the world shouldn’t seek a lonely old age, I made my mother so angry she chased after me and beat me. My mother didn’t hit hard, so it didn’t hurt, but I felt bad seeing her eyes red.”

Gu Can stood on his tiptoes and patted Fan Yan’s head. “Fools have foolish blessings. You’ll definitely be able to have a bunch of little fools with your yet-to-be-born wife in the future.”

Fan Yan grinned widely.

Gu Can rolled his eyes.

He never understood good and bad words, nor could he tell good people from bad ones.

However, everyone could see that a simpleton like Fan Yan would be easily deceived if he ever left the protective wings and view of his parents. But Gu Can was the most tolerant towards Fan Yan. It was fine to be deceived for money, as long as it didn’t go too far, and he wouldn’t allow others to bully Fan Yan either.

Lu Cai Sang’s eyes sparkled with excitement, even more so than Gu Can. “This is a great piece of news! Later at the banquet, Can, let’s drink a few more cups of Black Crow wine!”

Yuan Yuan, who had a round face, was the most carefree among the “brothers,” always smiling at everyone. No matter what jokes were made at his expense, he never got angry.

However, upon hearing such an astonishing piece of news, Yuan Yuan’s expression froze for a moment before quickly returning to normal, exclaiming, “If we’re riding on Gu Can’s coattails in the future, shouldn’t we be strutting around Book Letter Lake?”

Gu Can laughed, “Fan Yan, you, Cai Sang, and Yuan Yuan, take my two senior brothers to find a spot to eat crabs first. I’ll take a little detour to buy a few things.”

Fan Yan was furious, daring to glare at Gu Can. “Buy things? Buy?! Big Brother Gu, do you truly look down on me as your brother? In Water Pool City, do you need to spend money to get what you want?”

Gu Can jumped up and slapped Fan Yan’s face. “Who the hell said buying things has to cost money? Stealing things? How unpleasant!”

Fan Yan, after taking a slap, instead broke into a radiant smile, covering his face with one hand and giving a thumbs up with the other. “Big Brother Gu is still the best!”

Gu Can waved his hand dismissively. “Scram! Don’t waste my time enjoying the scenery. How am I supposed to find joy while hanging out with you guys?”

Lu Cai Sang firmly stated, “No, the situation in Book Letter Lake is chaotic. I have to stay by your side.”

Gu Can replied helplessly, “Fine, fine, fine. Just eat my dust following me around like a woman.”

Lu Cai Sang snorted coldly.

The two parties parted ways at the pier, and Fan Yan had, of course, prepared an extravagant carriage for his Big Brother Gu.

Gu Can and Lu Cai Sang walked toward one carriage, while the other two young women sat in another.

In the eyes of the countless mixed-breed cultivators around Book Letter Lake, the only commonality between Gu Can and Lu Cai Sang was that they both had a good master. Yet, surprisingly, their relationship was quite pleasant.

Gu Can kept his hands tucked in his sleeves and suddenly nudged Lu Cai Sang with his elbow, whispering with a mischievous grin, “If you went to my hometown and just happened to lose your cultivation, I bet those wandering lechers would be staring at you with their eyes shining, chasing you around to grope you. At that point, you’d be crying and banging on my door, ‘Gu Can, Gu Can, help! There are men trying to strip me!’ Haha, just thinking about it makes me so happy! But you know what would be even funnier? After those bastards strip you, they’d yell, ‘Damn, it’s a guy!’ The funniest part? Is when they grit their teeth and turn you over for some rough treatment… Ouch, I can’t take it anymore, my stomach hurts.”

Gu Can bent over, laughing heartily.

Lu Cai Sang’s face turned cold. “Disgusting!”

The two of them entered the carriage one after the other. Only then did Lu Cai Sang softly ask, “Why have you changed into such attire? Weren’t you averse to dressing so flamboyantly before?”

Gu Can closed his eyes and said nothing.

After a moment of hesitation, Lu Cai Sang said, “Yuan Yuan is very shrewd. His mother is related to a certain Nascent Soul sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Many around Book Letter Lake think this is Huang Li Island trying to intimidate people. But my master has said this matter is absolutely true. Yuan Yuan’s mother was originally a favored concubine of that powerful sword cultivator. Though she can’t be given a title, the connection still remains. You have to be careful. Once you kill Yuan Yuan, it means a Nascent Soul sword cultivator will be after you!”

Gu Can finally opened his eyes and asked, “No matter how bad Yuan Yuan is, can he compare to me, Gu Can?”

Lu Cai Sang suddenly covered his mouth and laughed.

Gu Can imitated his tone, saying sweetly, “Disgusting.”

Lu Cai Sang suddenly felt a wave of sadness wash over him as he looked at Gu Can, this “child” who changed every year. Who could dare to treat him as a child?

Even his master, a few of the old cultivators who could make the True Lord of the River feel apprehensive, all said that this strange being, Gu Can, unless he accidentally fulfilled the idiotic saying that those who do bad deeds will meet their ends, once he gathered the force unrelated to Qingxia Island, even the Immortals of the fifth realm wouldn’t dare mess with him.

Lu Cai Sang asked softly, “Gu Can, when can you truly open your heart to me?”

Gu Can pulled out a hand from the large sleeve of his python robe, lifted the carriage curtain, and casually replied, “You, Lu Cai Sang, can forget about that. There are only two people in this world who can make me show my heart to them. It will always be like this in this lifetime. I know it’s unfair to you because you are one of the few cultivators from Book Letter Lake who truly sees me as a friend, but there’s nothing I can do. We met too late. By the time you got to know me, I had already made a name for myself, so you can’t.”

Once they entered the city, Gu Can lowered the carriage curtain and smiled at Lu Cai Sang, “But don’t worry. If the day comes when you accidentally kill someone, I, Gu Can, will definitely help you take revenge.”

Lu Cai Sang pouted.

Leaning against the wall of the carriage, Lu Cai Sang asked, “Gu Can, how did you achieve all of this at such a young age?”

Gu Can replied, “In my hometown, I started watching my mother curse and fight with others when I was about three or four years old. I learn quickly.”

Gu Can raised a finger, “When I was a bit older, I could lie on a ridge under the scorching sun without moving for at least an hour, just to catch a mud loach. Even that mud loach can’t compare to me.”

Lu Cai Sang curiously asked, “Who is that ‘he’?”

Gu Can squinted his eyes and retorted, “Do you want to die?”

In that moment, the fearless Lu Cai Sang felt a twinge of trepidation.
