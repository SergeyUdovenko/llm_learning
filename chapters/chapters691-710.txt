 ### Chapter 691: You Come to Be My Senior Brother

Chen Pingan stowed away his talismanic boat and landed atop the city wall. 

To his left and right, the sword qi was intentionally restrained. Thus, the two stood no more than ten steps apart. 

Left and right gazed out toward the vast expanse beyond the city walls and asked a question, “Have you thought about some things that are bound to happen?”

To the north of the Sword Qi Great Wall, there lay a city steeped in deep heritage and secrets, giving off an aura of rigid rules, yet somehow also seeming lawless. 

In this place, there were sword immortals who, amidst great battles, had slain countless enemies. When the fighting paused, they lived the carefree life of earthly emperors, indulging in pleasures, with a cross-continent ferry dedicated to transporting martial artists from this continent. Those deemed attractive were taken to a resplendent palace to serve as maidens, while those deemed unworthy had their heads severed by flying swords, yet they were still generously compensated.

Some sword immortals, however, preferred tending to small vegetable patches and orchards, living the life of humble farmers year after year.

Others enjoyed mingling in the streets, employing tricks to conceal their identities, spending their days with ruffians in dingy alleys.

There were young scions from powerful clans who yearned to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall to study at the Imperial Academy. Then there were reckless sons from affluent families, capricious and extravagant, who squandered money and delighted in torturing their servants.

The last sage who held sway over the Sword Qi Great Wall was greatly displeased by this, yet the top sword immortal, Chen Qingdu, simply remarked, “Let’s talk after we’ve fought.” 

That sage then engaged in three battles—winning two and losing one—before leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, returning to the vast realm of righteousness. He had triumphed over two local sword immortals but lost to the hidden official. 

Here, the distinction between right and wrong was not as clear-cut as one might imagine.

Even rumors that reached the ears of the left and right made it clear that peril loomed thickly in the air. 

In human affairs, the greatest fear was lack of a standpoint, where right and wrong became muddled. The greatest fear was those who spoke only of their stands, dividing everything into black and white. 

What Left and Right feared most were the so-called wise men who believed that only positions mattered, devoid of reason.

Chen Pingan inquired, “Is it near or far?”

Left and Right gathered their scattered thoughts and replied, “The matters at hand over there, and those beside us.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “My senior brother had warned me before, and I understand the atmosphere over there. Words and actions are unrestricted, so it won't be long before currents stir beneath the surface. After a while, those idle whispers will gradually become clear. My four consecutive victories are part of the reason, my connection to the Ning family is another, and being a disciple of the teacher, and a junior to my senior brother, also play a part. The reason it hasn’t happened yet is that Old Sword Immortal Dong took people to the Shattered Ridge tavern to drink, which has forced many who were ready to speak to close their mouths instead.”

Left and Right stated, “Let’s only discuss the consequences.”

Chen Pingan responded, “Many people are afraid that the matter concerning the Ning family will resurface, so they are reluctant to see the relationship between the Ning and Yao families return to harmony. With me in the picture, the pure relationship between Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, Dong Huafu, and Yan Zhuo will, in the eyes of some, become murky. It might not have mattered before, but now they will be less willing. There may also be the addition of the Guo family, so the situation ahead will become quite complicated. Guo Zhujiu is likely to be confined at home soon, as unpleasant rumors will soon reach the Guo family. For example, they might say that the Guo family’s ability to burn cold stoves is quite impressive, or that Guo family sword immortals are calculating enough to have a young girl broker relationships, which is quite a skill. Regardless of what is said, the outcome is the same: the Guo family can only temporarily distance themselves from the Ning family, after all, the Guo family is not solely about Guo Sword Immortal. Over a hundred people still need to maintain their standing at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

All of this was manageable, but what Chen Pingan feared were the even more despicable methods of certain individuals. For example, a child from the nearby alley by the tavern suddenly collapsing.

However, Chen Pingan did not voice this concern.

Left and Right remarked, “Unless Chen Qingdu steps in to propose a marriage.”

Chen Pingan nodded.

Left and Right questioned, “Why aren’t you anxious?”

Chen Pingan replied, “I don’t dare to urge the top sword immortal, and besides, whether early or late, I have my own ways to deal with it.”

Left and Right continued to ask, “What do you mean?”

Chen Pingan answered, “It's just words; I won’t care, nor can I. If someone reaches out, I have both fists and swords. If that’s not enough, I can borrow from my senior brother.”

Left and Right nodded with a hint of amusement, “Good. I won’t ask too much about your specific plans; you should ponder it carefully. The unexpected occurrences at the Sword Qi Great Wall are often surprisingly simple and straightforward, yet they can be extraordinarily unexpected.”

“Do you know how many sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall are honing their swordsmanship in the wilderness?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “That is top-level confidentiality; I’m not privy to it.”

Left and Right laughed, “Then what do you know?”

Chen Pingan replied, “I only know the names and general backgrounds of sword immortals at the five realms atop the Sword Qi Great Wall, as well as the important figures from over a dozen major families, including the Dong, Chen, and Qi families, totaling one hundred and twenty-one people. Although it’s of little significance, it’s better than nothing.”

Left and Right asked in confusion, “Are you really that free?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “It’s become second nature, and I’m quite familiar with this matter. It won’t interfere with my training in boxing or cultivation; my senior brother can rest assured.”

Left and Right inquired, “Do you prefer the merchants and the practitioners?”

Chen Pingan was taken aback, shaking his head, “I’ve never delved into the teachings or texts of those two schools.”

Left and Right glanced at Chen Pingan and said with a smile, “These two schools, while regarded as the lesser streams of the three teachings and nine schools, have long been rejected and scorned by Confucianism. However, I believe you should browse through their writings. It won’t hurt, just don’t get too caught up in narrow details. Many worldly studies may seem astonishing at first glance, yet they often prove shallow. What initially appears vast and boundless may also be overgrown with weeds. Only after thorough reading will you realize they are not as profound as they seem, but reading is still necessary. The ability to derive a fundamental truth from a book of various teachings and sages is a significant gain.”

Chen Pingan clasped his fists in salute, “I appreciate the guidance.”

Left and Right stood up, “Unless it’s to observe the fights in the northern city, generally, sword immortals won’t use the divine powers that govern mountains and rivers to check on the movements of the city; this is an unwritten rule. Some matters need to be resolved by yourself, and you’ll bear the consequences. However, there’s one thing I can help you keep an eye on; what do you think it is? What do you hope most to observe?”

Chen Pingan answered without hesitation, “I hope my senior brother can keep an eye on the children in the nearby alley by the tavern, so they won’t die because of me.”

Left and Right did not directly respond, instead asking, “Isn’t that the least of things? Is it worth my attention?”

Chen Pingan laughed, “In the eyes of scholars, there are no trivial matters in the world.”

Left and Right sighed, “Chen Pingan, if you had become the teacher’s disciple earlier, it would have been good. The teacher wouldn’t have to worry for a hundred years. You could replace me in managing the teacher’s purse. You could talk to the teacher about many things. I’m not good at that.”

Chen Pingan absolutely refused to engage in such topics.

Left and Right suddenly said, “When the teacher became a sage, there were still people who criticized him, calling him an old literary fox, saying he was like a spirit cultivated from ink. Upon hearing this, the teacher simply responded with two words: ‘Wonderful!’”

Chen Pingan said, “In the Great Sui Dynasty, after the Emperor Gao signed a pact with the Da Li Dynasty, public resentment was high, including insults directed at Brother Mao as a literary demon. Looking back now, Brother Mao probably felt pleased at that time.”

Left and Right fell silent.

Chen Pingan also kept quiet.

As for practicing swordsmanship, it could wait a little longer. After all, he would eventually get overwhelmed.

Chen Pingan suddenly hesitated, glancing at Left and Right.

Left and Right nodded, signaling Chen Pingan to speak freely.

Chen Pingan then expressed his thoughts, “Senior brother, could there be sword immortals in the city secretly spying on the Ning family?”

Left and Right pondered, “Even if there are, it won’t last long. It can only happen occasionally, after all, Nalan Ye Xing isn’t just for show. Nalan Ye Xing is an expert in assassination and one of the most underestimated sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall. He can kill others, so he is naturally skilled in hiding and reconnaissance.”

Chen Pingan’s expression grew serious as he said, “Ah Liang taught me the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops. I not only taught it to my disciple Pei Qian, but also to a common boy from Baoping Continent named Zhao Gaoshu. He has an excellent character; there’s absolutely no issue. However, the boy hasn’t yet gone to the Fallen Mountain, and I’m afraid… what if!”

Left and Right said, “I will handle this matter.”

Chen Pingan felt a weight lift from his shoulders.

With his senior brother around, things indeed felt different.

Then Left and Right continued, “After discussing all this, it’s still not your reason for delaying your sword practice.”

Chen Pingan was left speechless.

The scoundrel from the Wei and Jin periods had wronged him, and that could not serve as an excuse.

Given his senior brother’s temperament, he wouldn’t consider such an excuse.

If he were to mention it, practicing swordsmanship would only become worse.

Those not from the Confucian lineage would probably not understand the reasoning behind it.

Left and Right returned to the city wall, entering a meditative state to nurture his sword intent.

Chen Pingan tentatively asked, “How does one practice swordsmanship?”

Left and Right chuckled, “What’s this? A Gold Body Realm martial artist thinks they’re invincible in the world and still need me to draw my sword?”

Chen Pingan understood and cautiously asked, “Then shall I use my fists?”

Left and Right ignored him.

Chen Pingan hesitated, wondering if he should start with the divine drum style.

Unexpectedly, Left and Right slowly said, “Within a hundred punches, if you can approach within thirty steps of me while using flying swords, I’ll call you senior brother from now on.”

No longer deliberately restraining his sword qi, Left and Right expanded like a small world suddenly enlarging, and in an instant, Chen Pingan was propelled backward by twenty steps.

Not too much and not too little, the distance between them was now thirty steps.

Sword qi surged forth, like countless tangible flying swords swirling before his eyes. If it weren’t for Chen Pingan’s own fist intent naturally flowing to resist the strands of sword intent spilling out, he would have been covered in wounds and forced to retreat even further. 

Left and Right smiled, “After a hundred punches, if I feel that you’ve gone too easy with your punches, especially if you’ve treated this senior brother with too much respect, then you can prepare to complain to the teacher next time.”

Chen Pingan forced a smile, “Senior brother, I’m not that kind of person.”

Left and Right retorted, “After practicing swordsmanship, you won’t be either.”

The Wei and Jin dynasties were two different eras, with the sober one and the drunken one being distinct.

This young sword immortal, the first to appear in Baoping Continent in a thousand years, was quite popular at the Sword Qi Great Wall, especially among women.

Young girls might not idolize Wei Jin, after all, there were many sword immortals back home. Although Wei Jin was very young, and it was said he had already reached the fifth realm by forty, it was not particularly uncommon at the Sword Qi Great Wall. In terms of flying sword lethality, Wei Jin was not outstanding, at least not yet, as he was still in the Jade Purity Realm. In terms of appearance, Qi family men were renowned for their handsomeness, and Wei Jin couldn’t be considered the most eye-catching; Chen Sanqiu’s family was not lacking in that department either.

However, older women were unanimously fond of Wei Jin, saying that watching him drink made one feel particularly sympathetic. 

When Wei Jin wasn’t drinking, he seemed perpetually troubled, but after a few drinks, he would show a gentle smile, and after a hearty drink, his spirit would be invigorated.

Thus, for those women who had seen Wei Jin drink, this young sword cultivator who came from the Wind and Snow Temple was like a celestial being stepping out of the snowstorm.

One couldn’t help but wonder what kind of woman could make Wei Jin so unable to let go.

Having left a heartless man like Ah Liang behind, a lovestruck soul like Wei Jin had arrived—Heaven was still fair.

As for Left and Right, it was best not to dwell on him; merely glancing was enough to hurt the eyes, so why bother? Moreover, Left and Right also didn’t like to roam around the city; being far away made it hard to see clearly, and it was far less concerning than Wei Jin, who often drank. 

After every drunken episode, he would stumble home, leaving behind a lingering scent of alcohol, that disheveled figure as he flew back to the city wall was truly pitiful.

Today, Wei Jin had drunk a bit too much at the Shattered Ridge tavern. A table was crowded with over ten people. Wei Jin had a good nature when it came to drinking, never putting on airs. If there were no seats, it was perfectly fine to squeeze onto a long bench with two or three others. This was perhaps the charm of someone who had grown accustomed to the rivers and lakes below the mountains. In this regard, local sword immortals and sword cultivators from other continents were indeed not as natural as Wei Jin.

For Chen Pingan, who had first met Wei Jin as a young lad, it was hard to say whether he liked him or not. Nowadays, he had grown to appreciate him a bit more.

However, He Xiaoliang was someone Wei Jin couldn’t help but like.

The farther he distanced himself, the more he drank; Wei Jin had hidden himself beneath the mountain, concealed in the rivers and lakes, yet he still couldn’t forget.

First, one was in the Wind and Snow Temple, and the other in the Divine Instruction Sect.

Then one was in Baoping Continent, while the other was in Beiju Lu Continent.

Finally, now, one was in the Wild Lands, and the other in the Vast World of Righteousness.

Yet she still lingered in Wei Jin’s cup, no matter how much he drank, it was futile. One cup down, and another was filled; she was still there.

Wei Jin raised his cup and loudly asked, “Why is it difficult for those who dislike drinking to get drunk?”

He downed the drink in one go, “The earliest brewers of alcohol in the world are truly hateful, far too hateful.”

He had grown accustomed to Shattered Ridge.

Sword Immortal Wei Jin often drank like this, merely speaking to himself more, but he never truly lost himself in drunkenness. Otherwise, a small tavern would not be able to withstand the madness of a sword immortal.

At that moment, no one was calling for more wine. The tavern was busy yet relaxed, and Shattered Ridge sighed softly to himself. 

Here we go again.

Wei Jin stood still, continuously pouring wine, looking around as he began to toast one by one, calling them by name. After toasting, he explained why he was toasting, naturally speaking of the killings to the south of the city wall, noting how impressive each sword was. Occasionally, he would ask others to drink as a penalty, also mentioning that some demons who deserved to be killed had only been left half-dead, which was unacceptable.

Suddenly, Wei Jin vanished and furiously exclaimed, “Despicable!”

In a small alley, Guo Zhujiu staggered through. 

A thin, sallow boy had already dashed into the alley ahead, hurriedly glancing back as if he were avoiding something. Upon seeing Guo Zhujiu, he hesitated and slowed his pace, instinctively edging closer to the wall. Here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the wealthy would only grow richer as long as they didn’t die, eventually forming a family. Once a sword immortal emerged from a family, it would elevate them to nobility. The impoverished people in the city could tell at a glance whether someone was a scion of a wealthy family based on their clothing.

The boy clearly thought Guo Zhujiu was a member of a high-status family, and he was indeed right. The Guo family was one of the leading families beyond the top-tier clans at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Provoking a noble scion would not end well; there was no need for the other party to bring up their powerful connections. If the other party was a sword cultivator, they would often just take matters into their own hands.

Guo Zhujiu slowed down her pace, bouncing a couple of times, and saw that behind the boy were four peers brandishing sticks, making a ruckus. 

The boy, probably thinking that Guo Zhujiu didn’t seem like a sword cultivator, assumed she was merely a wealthy person from a few major streets, who had come here out of boredom.

Feeling anxious, the boy waved at Guo Zhujiu, signaling her to leave the alley quickly.

Guo Zhujiu scratched her head, stopped, turned around, and fled.

Running away was something she excelled in and enjoyed.

Unfortunately, the delay allowed the boy to be quickly caught up by his peers wielding sticks. One stick struck the thin boy's head, and as he barely dodged it, another stick came crashing down. He had to protect his head with his hands, retreating while dodging. One stick hit his arm, causing his face to turn pale, and then he received a kick to the chest from a taller boy.

The sallow boy staggered back a few steps, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth as he leaned against the wall, tilting his head to avoid another stick. He turned and ran for his life. 

Guo Zhujiu peeked out from the alley's corner, feeling she should act heroically, as it seemed like a situation that could lead to a fatal outcome. 

Ordinary fights, even if someone went lame, were usually ignored by everyone at the Sword Qi Great Wall. But killing someone was rare. Guo Zhujiu had heard her elders say that those who fought fiercely were not sword immortals but rather the hot-blooded youth from the streets, which was exactly the case now. This wouldn’t do; Guo Zhujiu had recently learned boxing and considered herself a member of the rivers and lakes. Thus, she re-entered the alley.

That frail boy took another kick and was pinned down by Guo Zhujiu’s hand on his shoulder.

The boy’s gaze was calm, and in an instant, he twisted his body while deftly drawing a short knife from his sleeve, stabbing backward.

Guo Zhujiu lightly raised her elbow, directly breaking the arm of the one wielding the knife.

The boy’s other hand formed a fist and suddenly thrust forward, producing a tremendous force like thunder.

Those who had previously beaten the boy like a drowned rat were now terrified, pressed against the wall, their faces drained of color.

Guo Zhujiu, akin to the assassin boy, bore a similarly indifferent expression and also threw out a punch in return. The fist met fist, and the assassin boy’s entire hand shattered upon impact. Both collapsed to the ground, and Guo Zhujiu slightly turned her body, charging forward and shouldering the boy’s chest, causing the assassin to die on the spot. Yet, as a flicker of light shot past the assassin’s ear, it was a flying sword, piercing directly toward Guo Zhujiu’s brow.

Guo Zhujiu turned her head slightly, and a deep gash was cut into her forehead, exposing bone.

In contrast, the tall boy who had unleashed the flying sword had his head pierced through, a droplet of blood forming on his forehead as he slid down the wall to the ground.

Guo Zhujiu frowned and wiped her forehead with her palm.

Standing at the alley's mouth, Wei Jin exhaled in relief, quietly retracting his life sword. This sword immortal from the Wind and Snow Temple felt a mix of laughter and tears; it turned out he had done this all for nothing.

Not only had the young girl handled the sudden assassination attempt without incident, but a smiling hunchbacked old man also appeared at the other end of the alley.

Wei Jin nodded to him, and the old man returned the gesture with a smile.

Wei Jin then returned to the tavern to continue drinking.

The old man stepped forward, coming to Guo Zhujiu’s side, smiling, “Green-End Girl, well done.”

It was Nalan Ye Xing, the old servant from the Ning family.

The future son-in-law had instructed that as long as Guo Zhujiu saw him or entered the Ning family, he would need to help look after the young girl until the moment she stepped through the Guo family’s main entrance.

Guo Zhujiu beamed, “Of course, if I can’t defeat Ning Sister and Dong Sister, then how can I not handle a few little rascals?”

The young girl stepped forward, looking at the serene expression of the sallow boy who had died, and complained, “Did you not see that I just practiced an unparalleled boxing technique? Huh?!”

Nalan Ye Xing extended a finger and tapped her forehead, feeling a headache coming on.

This meticulously planned ambush targeted at the young scions of noble families required no sense of luck. One shouldn’t think about following clues; it wasn’t feasible.

Years ago, there had been a tremendous upheaval at Mirage City, where the lady nearly harmed the foundations of the Great Dao. Bai Lianshuang’s aunt had also fallen, causing even the top sword immortal, who generally ignored everything on the city wall, to be enraged enough to personally issue orders. He summoned the head of the Chen family to deliver a single sword strike. The wounded head of the Chen family hastily returned to the city, initiating a thorough investigation, sealing off the entire city for searches, turning Mirage City upside down. Yet, the final outcome remained unresolved. It wasn’t that anyone had been deliberately negligent or obstructive, but rather that they simply could not find any leads.

As for the other confused and frightened street youths, their identities would need checking, but it was merely a formality to provide the Guo family with an explanation. Of course, the Guo family would definitely take action, using methods and channels to dig deep.

After this incident, the interactions between the Ning and Guo families would become somewhat troublesome.

The Green-End Girl could, in theory, roam freely at the Sword Qi Great Wall; the reason was simple—she had once been chosen as a disciple by the hidden official. 

Thus, the Guo family had not particularly arranged for her to have a sword master accompany her over the years, as there was no need.

Hence, the ripples from this incident and the extent of the other party’s actions seemed significant, as if they were deliberating whether to kill or spare this Green-End Girl, so they didn’t deploy their most crucial chess piece.

Guo Zhujiu frowned, looking frail, “Oh no, I won’t be going out for a while.”

Guo Zhujiu’s eyes suddenly lit up as she turned to Nalan Ye Xing, “Grandpa Nalan, why don’t we destroy the evidence and pretend this never happened?”

Nalan Ye Xing chuckled, “You think too much. With your forehead wound, how can you hide it? Did you bump it while walking? Furthermore, for such a big matter, you should inform Guo Sword Immortal. I’ve already sent word to your family via flying sword. So just wait to be scolded.”

Guo Zhujiu sighed, “Grandpa Nalan, you must tell my master. I won’t be able to find him to learn boxing recently.”

Nalan Ye Xing teased, “When did my future son-in-law ever acknowledge you as his disciple?”

Guo Zhujiu grinned, “That’s just something my master calculated.”

Nalan Ye Xing pointed at the girl’s forehead.

Guo Zhujiu laughed, “Just a little drizzle!”

Then the girl shivered, her face turned mournful, “Ouch, that really hurts!”

A tall middle-aged sword immortal appeared in an instant, standing beside Guo Zhujiu. He bent down, reached out, and gently shook her head to confirm his daughter’s injury. Sighing in relief, he noted that the residual sword qi wasn’t serious. He straightened up and chuckled, “Still up for some fun?”

Guo Zhujiu extended a hand.

Sword Immortal Guo Jia laughed, “Five years of confinement?”

Guo Zhujiu timidly replied, “Let’s say five hours; okay, five days.”

Guo Jia’s smile faded.

Seeing the situation turning dire, Guo Zhujiu quickly retracted four fingers, leaving just her thumb, “One year!”

Guo Jia glanced at his daughter’s wound and said helplessly, “Hurry up and follow me home; your mother is going to be worried sick. Whether it’s a year or several years, it doesn’t matter what you say; you’ll have to roll around and throw a fit with her.”

Finally, Guo Jia and Nalan Ye Xing exchanged a glance, requiring no further words.

Soon, the Guo family’s attendants and sword cultivators who specialized in handling such matters arrived, all actions orderly.

Nalan Ye Xing did not return directly to the Ning family but first visited the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Upon reaching the Ning family, Bai Lianshuang’s aunt was not adept at handling these matters. Upon hearing it, she would only become anxious, unable to do anything but seethe.

Discussing this matter with the young lady would certainly be useful, as over the years, the major decisions in the Ning family had been made by her. However, now that the Ning family had Chen Pingan as their son-in-law, Nalan Ye Xing hoped the young lady wouldn’t be too distracted by such trivial matters. Yet, the son-in-law was the one least afraid of trouble and most inclined to overthink, and the young lady would certainly heed whatever decision he made.

Concealing his aura, he quietly approached the city wall. Were there those practicing swordsmanship and boxing here?

Chen Pingan was seen repeatedly executing a single move, the divine drum style of cumulative punches, while simultaneously maneuvering two real and two imitation flying swords, desperately searching for openings in the sword qi, as if striving to advance a single step.

It seemed he would need to use the Ning family’s elixirs again.

Fortunately, this time, the blame wouldn’t fall on that Bai lady.

The sword qi coalesced within thirty steps of Left and Right. However, occasionally, a strand of sword qi would dart out, lingering momentarily at the critical points on Chen Pingan’s body before vanishing swiftly.

Nalan Ye Xing couldn’t help but exclaim, “How is it possible for a human to possess so much sword qi, and it’s almost being refined into sword intent?”

Left and Right completely ignored the old man and gathered the sword qi within ten steps, telling Chen Pingan, “That’s enough for today. Your punches were acceptable, but your flying swords were stiff and slow. Today was just to help you get accustomed; next time we practice swordsmanship, that will be the real start. Also, you effectively died ninety-six times today; next time, try to die fewer times. Is it really that difficult to be an easily available senior brother?”

Chen Pingan nodded, saying nothing.

Is it appropriate to ask me whether it’s difficult or not? 

How heavy or numerous is the sword qi? Senior brother, don’t you have any sense of it?

Moreover, at this moment, while it appeared Chen Pingan was unharmed aside from his fists and arms, the reality was far from that. Each time Left and Right suspended the sword qi, appearing not to touch Chen Pingan’s major acupoints, the chilling sword intent had already seeped into his marrow, causing turmoil in his qi field. At this moment, the fact that Chen Pingan could speak without trembling was already a testament to his tolerance for pain.

Chen Pingan took a few steps and approached Nalan Ye Xing, softly asking, “Is Guo Zhujiu hurt?”

Nalan Ye Xing answered, “I’ve been keeping an eye on her, purposely not intervening, allowing the little girl to resolve her own trouble. She’s not seriously injured. Guo Jia arrived personally and didn’t say much; after all, he is Guo Jia. However, as for the subsequent troubles…”

Chen Pingan aligned his fingers and gently made a slicing motion downward, as if cutting through a long thread with a sword, shaking his head, “It’s already beyond trouble. For the Ning family and the Guo family, it’s actually a good thing. I have resolved to take Guo Zhujiu as my disciple.”

Chen Pingan piloted his talismanic boat alongside Nalan Ye Xing back to the city.

Curious, Chen Pingan asked, “Grandpa Nalan, can you get close to my senior brother?” 

“Of course!” 

Nalan Ye Xing laughed, “And then I would die.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 692: Join Me, Chen Ping'an, for a Drink

Ning Yao saw Chen Ping'an returning from the city wall, but said little. The old woman had been hurt by the recent events and unleashed a torrent of curses at Nalan Yexing. 

Nalan Yexing didn’t retort; he accepted his fate. It wasn’t every day that a distinguished sword immortal found himself in such a predicament. 

The old woman took to drinking alone. 

Chen Ping'an was well acquainted with tending to injuries, having already been given the key to the Ning family's alchemical storeroom by Granny Bai. 

On the way, Chen Ping'an recounted the assassination of Guo Zhujiu to Ning Yao and Granny Bai, detailing everything that had transpired. 

The old woman muttered, “These vile creatures love to bully the young; they deserve nothing good in their lives.” 

Ning Yao was not too concerned; the girl herself was unharmed, and she didn’t want to dwell on it further. After all, Chen Ping'an enjoyed mulling over such matters, so let him take the burden. 

With Ning Yao accompanying her future son-in-law, Granny Bai chose to refrain from intervening. She looked for an opportunity to scold Nalan Yexing again; she hadn’t vented all her frustrations when he was present with Miss Ning.

Chen Ping'an, accustomed to the route, found three porcelain jars despite his bloodied arms and exposed bones. He was still in high spirits, preparing to apply various ointments on himself. The three colors of the ointments had their own order of application, and while bandaging his wounds, he even joked, “According to our dragon kiln’s method of making porcelain, this is called ‘Three Colors Glaze.’ It’s not anything precious; the emperors of the Great Li rarely had true imperial wares. Most were used to reward loyal subjects. Before the last emperor, the old emperor was fond of a particular under-glaze blue and small fighting colors, plus some gold detailing—that was truly beautiful. The process is complex and incredibly difficult, and we’ve never had the chance to see a complete piece. I’ve only seen fragments of inferior products at Old Porcelain Mountain. They were indeed flashy, crafted with intricate techniques that required dozens of dragon kilns, only the young Head Yao could manage such work in his youth.”

At first, Chen Ping'an feared that Ning Yao would find his chatter tedious, but to his surprise, she listened intently, prompting him to share more amusing anecdotes from his time at the dragon kiln.

“When I was an apprentice, Liu Xianyang often dragged me to Old Porcelain Mountain. Once there, he treated it like his own home, picking and choosing as if he were recounting family treasures—the new and old porcelain from various dynasties, what they originated from, what marks they should have, all were nearly the same as what he personally crafted. Burning porcelain is indeed a talent when none of us were cultivators. Once we became cultivators, viewing human endeavors in music, chess, literature, and painting inevitably changed our perspective. When looking at them, the flaws become too glaring, the mistakes too numerous, and they cannot withstand scrutiny. Such a beautiful saying, ‘Becoming a guest in the mountains, I awaken from my deep dreams, only to find it ordinary.’”

“Song Jixin’s father is much more subdued and elegant. Our kiln specially crafted large wares for the court. Privately, we apprentices would take many characteristics of those imperial artifacts and jokingly refer to them as ‘mud catfish backs, lamp grass roots, and cat whiskers.’ Back then, we even speculated about whether the wealthiest emperor in the world knew these jargons. I heard that the current young emperor has turned to favor more vibrant styles, but still more restrained than his grandfather.”

Ning Yao laughed, “How can you remember so many things? I can’t seem to remember at all.” 

Chen Ping'an responded, “How is it that you can turn around and insult someone?”

Ning Yao looked confused, “What did I insult you about?”

Chen Ping'an said, “Aren’t you complaining about my slow progress in cultivation?”

Ning Yao playfully flicked a finger at Chen Ping'an's arm, “That’s what you asked for.”

Chen Ping'an quickly turned to dodge, “Ordinary women would have cried buckets upon seeing me in such a state, but you—you're just adding insult to injury.”

Ning Yao paused her steps, “Oh? Did I make you suffer?”

Chen Ping'an remained calm, his feet together as he hopped forward, shaking his head, “How could the Ning Yao I like be an ordinary woman?”

Ning Yao kicked Chen Ping'an from behind.

He stumbled forward, falling on his face before flipping himself upright with a flourish, grinning as he turned back, “Want to learn my Earth Anchor stance?”

Ning Yao continued walking, too lazy to respond to him.

Chen Ping'an stood still, waiting for Ning Yao to catch up before continuing their stroll, softly asking, “The batch of innate sword cultivators before you, the ones around fifty to a hundred years old, are they strong? I’ve only seen one of them, Wang Zongping, over at the Shattered Peaks Tavern; he’s a sword cultivator at the Nascent Soul bottleneck. I haven’t met the rest.”

Ning Yao didn’t rush to answer; instead, she asked, “In our generation of sword cultivators, the talent is extraordinary, a once-in-a-millennium occurrence, as you’ve heard. After two large battles, do you know how many are left?”

Chen Ping'an said, “Including Guo Zhujiu and the six who went to the city wall but didn’t return south, there are thirty-two left. Currently, twenty-four are alive, eight died in battle, half of them in chaotic skirmishes. The highly talented Zhang Rong was even ambushed and killed by a major demon in the Jade Purity realm. The protective sword master beside Zhang Rong couldn’t save him, and they both perished.”

Ning Yao looked at Chen Ping'an, seemingly reluctant to speak further. He knew everything, so why bother asking? There were plenty of things she couldn’t remember clearly, yet he was so well-informed.

However, seeing Chen Ping'an’s pitiful state, Ning Yao continued, “I need to focus on my cultivation; we’ll talk later.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Then I’ll go drink with Old Man Nalan.”

Ning Yao quickened her pace, “Suit yourself.”

Initially, Chen Ping'an hadn’t wanted to drink, but now he truly felt like it.

Ning Yao didn’t turn around but said, “Don’t drink too much.”

Chen Ping'an agreed verbally, but in truth, he hadn’t been particularly inclined to drink earlier; suddenly, he craved it even more.

Arriving at Nalan Yexing’s residence, the old man sighed deeply. It wasn’t that drinking wouldn’t alleviate his sorrow; rather, it was that his wife had just stormed out after a fierce tirade.

Nalan Yexing smiled and asked, “Care for a drink?”

Chen Ping'an nodded with a grin. The old man poured a bowl of wine, cautious not to fill it completely, knowing that his future son-in-law was still injured and didn't want to give his wife any reason to scold him again.

With his arms bandaged like a zongzi, Chen Ping'an moved clumsily. Yet, as a cultivator at the Fifth Realm, he had still learned some techniques. A flicker of thought allowed him to manipulate the wine bowl, bringing it closer to him. He tilted his head down and took a sip, imitating Chen Sanqiu’s style, and murmured, “This year’s stock is from the Ning family cellar. Granny Bai gives a set quota for wine every year. With the new year approaching, there are hardly any barrels left. Next year, she’ll definitely buy a lot to stock up.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Old Man Nalan, are you curious why my sword energy has made such slow progress?”

Nalan Yexing nodded, “Logically, it shouldn’t be this slow. It’s just that since you, Young Master Chen, haven’t brought it up, I wouldn’t pry.”

Chen Ping'an explained, “One of the barriers along the path of sword energy is like this bowl of wine—there were old treasures within it.”

Nalan Yexing inquired curiously, “Is it a relic from some sword immortal, or a personal flying sword of someone else?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “It’s a strand of sword energy.”

Nalan Yexing exclaimed in surprise, “A strand of sword energy?”

Chen Ping'an smiled brightly, “A ‘tiny, tiny’ strand of sword energy. No more than that, it’s not appropriate to say too much.”

With Nalan Yexing present, Chen Ping'an felt at ease to speak freely.

Even if the sword immortals in the city were to use their powers to peer into the Ning family, they would intentionally avoid Nalan Yexing, a former immortal.

Nalan Yexing was struck with shock but chose not to ask more. He raised his wine bowl, “No more talk; let’s drink.”

With Nalan Yexing, Chen Ping'an didn’t worry about etiquette. He drank without care, feeling no burden on his conscience.

Nalan Yexing, of course, didn’t mind. His future son-in-law was a sight for sore eyes. He had formidable martial arts, was quick to learn swordsmanship, was thoughtful, and was handsome to boot. Importantly, he had received an education—a rare quality among the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall. It was no wonder that Granny Bai was always protective of him.

While the old man and the young man drank, Ning Yao sat with Granny Bai, whispering to each other. 

The old woman looked at Miss Ning and asked, “Your fiancé trains hard in swordsmanship; it’s good for him to endure some hardship. You don’t have to worry too much. Not everyone can have their skills taught so thoroughly by the likes of that great sword immortal. Over the years, many have sought to get close to that clever young sword immortal, but he has been proud and aloof, never paying them any mind. In my opinion, he has truly recognized your fiancé not just as the disciple of the Sage of Literature but as a little brother he genuinely acknowledges.”

Ning Yao shook her head, leaning on the table, “That’s not it.”

The old woman chuckled but remained silent.

Ning Yao sat up straight, “He knows how to say many sweet things.”

The old woman asked, “Don’t you like that?”

Ning Yao shook her head, “It’s not that I don’t like it.”

The old woman continued, “Are you worried that he might like someone else?”

Ning Yao again shook her head, “Not worried.”

Finally, the old woman couldn’t help but laugh, “Is it that you feel he has changed too much, while you feel like you haven’t moved forward? You’re afraid that one day he’ll be ahead of you—not because you fear his cultivation will surpass yours, but that you’ll find you have less and less to talk about?”

Ning Yao felt her thoughts laid bare; she hunched down, lost in contemplation, and then quietly said, “Since childhood, I’ve never liked to talk. That guy, however, is quite the chatterbox. There’s so much he says that I don’t even know how to respond. What if one day he thinks I’m simply too dull? Of course, he would still like me, but he might stop wanting to talk.”

The old woman couldn’t contain her laughter, stifling her voice, “Good thing you haven’t said it aloud; otherwise, our fiancé would feel aggrieved. Women’s hearts are as deep as the ocean; your fiancé isn’t a god who can foresee everything.”

Ning Yao nodded, her mood slightly improved, but only a little.

The old woman was in no rush; such minor worries likely came only from truly liking someone.

That night, after midnight, on the city wall, Wei Jin stood beside Zuoyou, sipping from a jug of hard-to-come-by Qing Shen Mountain wine. The shop only sold one jug daily, and having gotten his hands on it meant that today, other sword cultivators would go without.

Wei Jin asked with a smile, “Did Chen Ping'an say I was a burden before practicing swordsmanship?”

Zuoyou shook his head, “Just asking for a beating; my little junior brother wouldn’t say something like that.”

Wei Jin sighed, “Is he really that clever?”

Zuoyou chuckled, “The teacher once said that your sword and mine combined made a significant impact on Chen Ping'an.”

Wei Jin paused, then nodded, “Years ago, at the ghost in a bridal gown, following my agreement with Senior Ah Liang, the sword was seen before the person, and I met the young Chen Ping'an.”

Zuoyou remained silent for a moment, “Did you feel that being troubled by emotions made it hard to attain purity in sword intent, making it difficult to reach the mountain's peak?”

Wei Jin nodded, “Indeed, I have such concerns, and the reality supports that.”

Zuoyou laughed, “Then you are wrong, terribly wrong.”

Wei Jin put away the wine, sitting up straight, “I would like to hear your teachings, Senior.”

Zuoyou said, “What is most important for sword cultivators practicing swordsmanship?”

Wei Jin shook his head, “I have many answers in mind, but they are certainly not what you think.” 

Zuoyou raised a hand, mimicking a sword-holding posture, “It is the person holding the sword. Thus, regardless of how high your sword skills or sword path are, they are all minor matters to a sword cultivator. No matter how legendary those five immortal swords are in your hands, regardless of your current realm, whether you are a sword immortal or not, you are still merely the one holding the sword.”

Zuoyou lowered his hand and turned his head, “If you are merely fond of a woman, the sword cannot be drawn. What kind of sword immortal are you? You, Wei Jin, are merely skilled in swordsmanship, allowing you to reach the Jade Purity realm. Over time, merely relying on talent won’t get you far. I can assert that if you do not break through your emotional barriers soon, your achievements will be mediocre at best, and you should speak less with me in the future.”

Wei Jin took a deep gulp of wine and murmured, “Yet I still believe that the bonds of love in this world surpass even sword energy. I cannot bear to sever them; I even wish to hold onto them. Thinking of people while drinking, muddled as I am, it seems better to me than liking fewer people, drinking less, and relying solely on my sword to ascend.”

Zuoyou shook his head, “You are doomed.”

Wei Jin tentatively asked, “Does this mean I will no longer be able to chat with you in the future?”

Zuoyou laughed, “Sword immortal Wei Jin, you should leave early. Wine-drunk Wei Jin can visit often.”

Wei Jin burst into hearty laughter, drinking freely. Just as he was about to ask a question, a universally acknowledged fact struck him: there were only four immortal swords in the world. So why did Zuoyou say there were five?

The Daoist Lao Er of the Qingming realm possessed an immortal sword. The Grand Master of Dragon Tiger Mountain in the Central Plains owned another, as did the scholar known as the most accomplished in the world. Furthermore, it was said that one of the nine great towns in the Haoran world, the Sword Suppression Tower, held the last sword. Four swords in total, vast as the world was, there were indeed not many immortal weapons, yet only these four could be rightfully called “immortal swords.” Such would not change for millennia.

Before Wei Jin could finish his wine or ask the question, he left the city wall.

The old sword immortal had arrived.

As Wei Jin departed the city wall, he bowed in farewell.

Chen Qingdu stood by the wall, “Surprised that you have such a little junior brother?”

Zuoyou nodded but remained silent.

The young Zhao Gaoshu, who had learned the Sword Energy Eighteen Stops. At that time, while Zuoyou isolated the world with sword energy, Chen Ping'an spoke these words.

In fact, at that moment, Chen Ping'an had spoken with his heart, but there was another name in his thoughts—Zhao Shuxia.

Such a young age, yet he was so cautious; even Zuoyou found this remarkable.

The old sword immortal didn’t mind the suspicion of disrespect from Zuoyou. If he couldn't even tolerate Zuoyou's slight pride, how many would remain alive under his sword in that northern city, along with the many sword immortals on the city wall?

Zuoyou was not surprised that Chen Qingdu knew of this matter.

On the city wall beneath both their feet, Chen Qingdu was indeed unmatched globally—perhaps only surpassed by the Sage of Literature at the Confucian Temple, the Dao Ancestor at the Baiyu Capital, or the Buddha on the lotus seat. 

This was also where Zuoyou felt most helpless.

But this was also where Zuoyou respected the old man the most.

For millennia of siege in the desolate world, why did the Sword Qi Great Wall still stand firm?

All the great demons of the desolate world understood well: as long as Chen Qingdu lived, even if the Sword Qi Great Wall were to vanish, they still couldn’t reach the Upside Down Mountain or the Haoran world.

Only Chen Qingdu could suppress the rebellious sword cultivators of the northern Sword Qi Great Wall for a thousand years.

Only he could say to the Hidden Official, “You are young; I will allow it.”

Chen Qingdu said, “Once the various troubles in the city have passed, have Chen Ping'an come to my thatched cottage to stay and focus on sword practice. Once he truly becomes an accomplished sword cultivator, I will leave the city wall and help him propose. Otherwise, I would be too embarrassed to bring it up. This old sword immortal’s exceptional actions, a shop full of wine, and a small school—none of these things can be bought lightly.”

Zuoyou replied, “It depends on his own wishes. If you don’t go to the Yao family, I will.”

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Now that would be very unkind. Whether it’s you here or your little junior brother here, you wouldn't speak so.”

Zuoyou frowned, “You’re watching over the children of the shabby alley? Chen Qingdu doesn’t care about many things, yet he cares about this?”

“Why not?”

Chen Qingdu countered, “My swordsmanship is higher than yours, my sword intent is superior, my sword way is better, and my knowledge is broader. You’re concerned; how can I not take a few more looks?”

Zuoyou’s expression turned serious, “I’ve let you off twice.”

Chen Qingdu smiled, “If the longest reach of sword energy can’t surpass a person, then just bear with it.”

Zuoyou coldly laughed, “That makes it three times.”

Chen Qingdu asked, “Do you know why I’m willing to pay attention to the children in the shabby alley?”

Zuoyou’s expression was calm, “This involves the greatest issue of the Sword Qi Great Wall. Sword cultivators have been slaying enemies for thousands of years, yet more and more people do not know why. Why are they born, and why do they die?”

Chen Qingdu nodded, gazing toward the lights of the northern city, where the grand mansions glowed brightly, as bright as day, while the dark alleys remained dim, with only a few stars to connect the two.

“Life and death are easy to discuss; after all, self-interest is heavy, and it’s hard for people to truly feel anything.”

Chen Qingdu’s expression grew despondent, “I always hope there are people over there who can think for themselves, figure things out on their own. Knowing the reasons behind everything, the history and origins, understanding what sacrifices they and their ancestors have made, still allowing those sword cultivators in the world, even if they harbor resentment, grievances, or anger, to still draw their swords. Both people and swords move south; if they die, they die.”

The old man slowly raised a hand, “The lights in the world begin as a single spark, growing into two, then three, until a vast starry river is formed.”

Zuoyou shook his head, “It’s too late; you’ve lost.”

Chen Qingdu smiled, “Zuoyou, you’re not as good as your little junior brother. Knowing there’s little use in trying to change the established outcome, you still remain patient in your efforts.”

Zuoyou fell silent.

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Four times now?”

Zuoyou replied, “Not yet.”

Chen Qingdu nodded, “Then I won’t hit you, to give you some face, so you won’t feel awkward when teaching your little junior brother.”

Zuoyou said, “Now you’ve hit four times.”

Chen Qingdu placed his hands behind him and left, only saying, “Compared to chatting with you, I prefer listening to Chen Ping'an.”

Zuoyou pondered.

It seemed that little junior brother had better relations with his elders.

In the moonlight, Chen Ping'an strolled over to the Dragon Slaying Platform. Ning Yao was still cultivating, so he walked to the training grounds, merely taking a walk and walking in circles. As he approached completion, he slightly diverted his steps, drawing a larger circle.

Before long, Ning Yao had arrived next to him, which didn’t surprise Chen Ping'an.

Nalan Yexing’s stealthy techniques had long been mastered by Ning Yao.

In all these years, what she had forged was not the highly ranked innate flying sword but something else entirely.

However, even if Ning Yao merely summoned her innate flying sword, it was enough to ensure victory against the likes of Pang Yuanji and Qi Shou.

This was something Chen Ping'an had learned during a casual chat with Ning Yao. She spoke casually, effortlessly, while focusing her gaze on Chen Ping'an.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an had just wanted to reach out and place his hand on her back, but he secretly withdrew, then raised his hand with a smile, fanning the refreshing breeze.

The two walked up to the pavilion.

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged beside Ning Yao.

Ning Yao continued the topic from earlier, “In Wang Zongping’s generation, there were initially about ten people. Compared to us, they fall short in both numbers and cultivation aptitude. The one who was originally expected to achieve the highest was Mi Quan, but unfortunately, Mi Quan died in the first battle outside the city. Now only three remain. Besides Wang Zongping, who has been heavily injured and remains stuck at the Nascent Soul bottleneck for years, there are Wang Wei and Su Yong. Su Yong’s innate aptitude is actually better than Wang Zongping, who was at the bottom back then, but his sword heart isn’t solid and clear enough. He participated in the major battles but preferred small skirmishes, fearing for his life. He thought that by quietly cultivating to a hundred years old, he could steadily step into the Fifth Realm and then fight fiercely. However, during the perilous battle at the Nascent Soul bottleneck in the Sword Qi Great Wall, Su Yong not only failed to ascend to Jade Purity but was instead rejected by the sword intent of heaven and earth, falling back down to become a Dan Room cultivator with poor quality, living in the alleys for years, becoming a gambling drunkard with numerous debts, living worse than a street rat. Qi Shou and others, when young, loved to invite Su Yong for drinks. As long as he could drink, he didn’t mind being regarded as a joke, living a life in the shadows. But when Qi Shou and the others reached higher levels, they found it no longer amusing to mock Su Yong. He then took on odd jobs between the city and the mirage, earning a little money to buy wine; when he made a lot, he would gamble.”

These were things she had learned in a hurry, asking Granny Bai for information.

Chen Ping'an straightforwardly asked, “Will Su Yong harbor resentment against the entire Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Ning Yao thought for a moment before shaking her head, “He shouldn’t. In the years after Ah Liang left the Sword Qi Great Wall, he often accompanied Su Yong when drinking or running a gambling house.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Only Wang Wei is already a sword immortal. Years ago, he was a Golden Dan sword cultivator, serving as the lowest-ranked vassal of the Qi family. Twenty years ago, he successfully ascended to the Fifth Realm, established his own household, and married a woman from a prominent family as his partner. That can be considered a fulfilling life. I heard in the tavern that Wang Wei later surpassed expectations and became a sword immortal.”

Ning Yao said, “Wang Wei indeed seems unremarkable. At around ninety years old, he reached the Fifth Realm. In the Haoran world, that’s certainly rare, but here, as a surviving Jade Purity realm sword cultivator, he naturally became the leader of the early ten. It’s easy to compare him. Compared to the earlier generation, he’s quite ordinary, and among our peers, not to mention Pang Yuanji, Qi Shou, and the likes of Gao Ye, they don’t think much of Wang Wei, who has become a sword immortal yet is still humble.”

Ning Yao softly added, “But in the Sword Qi Great Wall, regardless of the realm, being alive is the greatest ability. If you die, whether you were a genius or a sword immortal, what does it matter? Even we young sword cultivators, today while drinking and mocking Zhao Yong’s decline, Wang Wei’s indecisiveness as a sword immortal may very well bring up tales of old friends in the next big battle.”

Arriving at the Dragon Slaying Pavilion, Ning Yao suddenly asked, “Give me a jar of wine.”

Chen Ping'an pulled out a jug of his own Bamboo Sea Cave wine and handed it over. Ning Yao took a sip, “Little Uncle Dong is a true genius. At the upper city wall, in the observation sea realm below, he’s already slain more than ten beasts of the same realm and three Golden Dan beasts, earning himself the nickname ‘Sword Madman.’ Later, he left the Sword Qi Great Wall alone to hone his sword intent in the desolate world. By the time he returned, he was already a Fifth Realm sword cultivator, and in the following major battles, he killed countless demons. At that time, Little Uncle Dong was considered the most likely young man to become a sword immortal in the Ascension realm.”

Dong Guanpu conspired with great demons, and after his schemes were uncovered, public outrage erupted. Before the Hidden Official could take action, the old sword immortal, Chen Qingdu, personally struck him down with a sword.

Chen Ping'an had witnessed the scene from the city wall.

Ning Yao drank the wine, “Not long after Little Uncle Dong died, a rumor spread that my assassination at the Mirage was orchestrated by Little Uncle Dong himself.”

Ning Yao smiled, “I don’t believe it, but I can’t stop others from gossiping.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Without discussing the truth, would hearing such words upset you?”

Ning Yao shook her head, “There’s nothing to be upset about.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Then that’s good. Otherwise, I wouldn’t leave the city wall to practice swordsmanship anymore.”

Ning Yao inquired, “Besides that girl named Lü Duan who was attacked, is there more to come?”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Of course. Someone is planning to test my mettle and isolate the Ning family as much as possible. In the end, they want to distract you and delay your breakthrough. Previously, there were no opportunities. After the Mirage incident and the Dong Guanpu matter, with the old sword immortal personally intervening, no one dared to openly challenge the Ning family. Now that I’m here, they see an opportunity.”

Ning Yao asked, “How come you don’t seem worried about this at all? I’m actually bothered; I just know worrying is useless, so I don’t think about it too much.”

Chen Ping'an reached for the wine jug, and Ning Yao instinctively reached to hand it over but quickly shot him a glare.

Chen Ping'an didn’t get his way and continued with his hands in his sleeves, “How Chen Ping'an’s mettle is perceived by outsiders hinges on two things—cultivation and human heart. Pure martial artists like Ren Yi, Pu Yu, Qi Shou, and Pang Yuanji have already proven that. As for the human heart, one is up high, and the other is down low. If the opponent is good at scheming, they’ll test the waters. For example, once Guo Zhujiu was assassinated, the Ning family and the Guo family, which is under the protection of the sword immortal Guo Jia, would thoroughly distance themselves, regardless of how righteous Guo Jia might be. The hearts of the people in the Guo family already have a thorn in them. Of course, now that the girl is fine, it doesn’t matter. 

As for the lower hearts, it’s simple—if a child from the shabby alley dies, the business of Shattered Peaks Tavern will quickly falter. I won’t go back there to tell stories; if I do, no one will listen to my tales of mountains and rivers. Killing Guo Zhujiu comes with a hefty price, but killing an alley child? Who cares? But if I don’t care, how will the many sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall view me, Chen Ping'an? If I do care, how should I care and still make it count?”

Ning Yao listened, her brows furrowing.
 
Listening to Granny Bai, this fellow truly seemed to have calculated everything.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “What’s there to worry about? I’ve thought it through, so their opportunities are slim. However, some things, even once thought of, can only wait for the other party to make a move.”

Ning Yao asked, “For example?”

“For example, they widely proclaim me as the disciple of the Sage of Literature, Zuoyou’s little junior brother. That’s nothing much, just a scratch. The sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall still recognize genuine cultivation above all else.”

Chen Ping'an continued, “Another example is that a young sword cultivator without roots, drunk, speaks about the past of the Ning family in front of me. Most likely, their words won’t be too extreme; otherwise, it would be unreasonable, provoking public outrage. The patrons who can’t drink will step in to help. Therefore, how the other party chooses their words needs to be carefully crafted, well-prepared. They can incite my anger without making me think they’re stirring trouble; it could just be heartfelt words of righteousness. In the end, whether I kill him or not, it would be a loss for him. Young and impetuous do not last long; those with too deep a heart are not sword cultivators.”

Ning Yao considered, “Then shall we go to the Shattered Peaks Tavern less often? You only go back and forth between the city wall and the Ning family; no one should deliberately block you; that would be too blatant. There aren’t many fools among the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “We must go.”

Ning Yao was somewhat puzzled.

“The accountant likes to keep accounts, but he also has his own life to live. He won’t just sit at the counter all day calculating profits and losses. Who am I? I’ve lived a life of having nothing for so many years; why should I fear this?”

Chen Ping'an stood up, gazing at the training grounds, slowly saying, “You’ve listened to so many nonsensical words over the years; I also want to hear them with my own ears. You didn’t want to deal with them before, that’s fine, but now that I’m by your side, if anyone dares to harbor ill intentions and come knocking, if I don’t throw a punch right away, should I invite him for a drink instead?”

At this point, Chen Ping'an laughed, “It would certainly just be a casual punch because the opponent’s realm cannot be high; they must be worse than Ren Yi. If they were better, no one would sympathize.”

Ning Yao asked, “When shall we go to the tavern?”

This was Ning Yao’s character.

Chen Ping'an felt no surprise.

In those early days in the small town, even setting aside the feelings he had for her, Ning Yao’s decisiveness greatly influenced Chen Ping'an.

Among them, the phrase “the great way should not be so small” was significant; it made Chen Ping'an, upon leaving the Lizhu Cave, never truly look up at the gods on the mountain.

Ning Yao’s approach was particularly straightforward, emphasizing, “Now that it has come to this, what should we do?” This mindset deeply impressed Chen Ping'an.

With such a clear and transparent mindset, he could truly face unexpected troubles without fear. When faced with challenges, he would solve them.

Chen Ping'an turned and smiled, “After I recover from my injuries, I’ll also let the other party plan thoroughly. To be honest, many times, I feel anxious for my enemies, almost wanting to teach them how to make their moves for maximum benefit, while also being the most annoying.”

Ning Yao remained silent.

Chen Ping'an sat beside her, softly saying, “Don’t think I’m a stranger; I’ve always been this way. But like I told you before, there’s just one thing I never overthink. That’s not sweet talk; it’s the truth.”

Ning Yao murmured, “If you didn’t like me, if you hadn’t come here, there wouldn’t be so many things. You could have lived better. You could even wait until you became a sword immortal before finding me; I would still wait for you.”

Granny Bai was right; to be Ning Yao herself, she also had to trust Chen Ping'an, accumulating her words and sharing her thoughts with him. No matter whether they made sense or not, he was the most reasonable person, so there wouldn’t be any worries about not having anything to talk about.

However, Chen Ping'an didn’t respond to Ning Yao; he merely took out the small Dragon Slaying Platform that Ning Yao had gifted him at their farewell at the Upside Down Mountain. The front and back had the names “Ning Yao” and “Tian Zhen” carved on it. Chen Ping'an looked down at the name Ning Yao, his fingers pinching together gently, tapping that name lightly, his eyes wide open, chiding playfully, “Who are you? So bold and gifted, nearly making me heartbroken. If you keep this up, I might have to pretend not to know you…”

Ning Yao turned to the side, leaning on the railing, her eyes squinted with laughter, her eyelashes fluttering.

The bright moonlight painted her brows.

This day, the tavern’s second shopkeeper, who had not shown up for a long time, finally appeared to drink. Not competing for a spot at the table with the customers, he sat beside familiar sword cultivators, drinking while holding a wine bowl in one hand and chopsticks in the other. A small dish filled with pickled vegetables from the Yan family lay on the ground before him. Everyone did the same; there was no shame in it. 

According to the second shopkeeper, a great sword immortal stands tall, and what’s wrong with placing dishes on the ground? This shows the down-to-earth nature of sword cultivators, the casualness of sword immortals. Try drinking at some other expensive tavern; would you have this opportunity? Try placing your bowls and dishes on the ground? Even if the waitstaff don’t stop you, the other patrons would definitely give you dirty looks. In our place, is there such a troublesome matter? Absolutely not.

Sword cultivators coming to buy wine and drink, especially those who were somewhat financially strapped, found this reasoning very agreeable.

Today, no sword immortals had come to drink. Chen Ping'an sipped his wine in small gulps, chatting happily with familiar sword cultivators on either side.

Suddenly, a drunken young man, unfamiliar to him, staggered over, holding a wine bowl, swaying as he approached Chen Ping'an, belching and slurring, “You’re that Chen Ping'an, the son-in-law of the Ning family?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and nodded.

The young man was about to speak when Chen Ping'an raised his hand, gently clinking two chopsticks together, and with a stern face, hurried into the tavern, bringing out a piece of paper.

Ignoring this, the young man continued, “Do you deserve Ning Yao? I think you don’t. What does it matter if you defeated Pang Yuanji and the others? You still don’t deserve Ning Yao. But you’re lucky; you’re worthy of the Ning family. Do you know why?”

Chen Ping'an picked a piece of pickled vegetable, raised his wine jug, and pointed behind him.

The tavern’s staff unfolded the paper; it read, “Anyone discussing the old matters of the Ning family today should drink a penalty drink. The wine already consumed before seeing this letter does not require payment.”

At that moment, the dozens of patrons in the tavern held their breath. Some stopped drinking and eating, while others slowed their movements but continued to pick at their food.

The young man ignored it, downing a large gulp of wine, spilling some on the ground, his eyes bloodshot with rage, “The Sword Qi Great Wall almost fell, with the Hidden Official personally leading the charge. The opposing great demons avoided the battle, yet we all won. We won! Just one more match, just one! The fiercest beasts of the desolate world were about to stand by, yet your two sword immortals from the Ning family were good, right? They sent whatever the opposing beasts lacked…”

“The demon clan of the desolate world has no face; they lost yet still want to attack the city. But we of the Sword Qi Great Wall have face! If we hadn’t won the last match, you, Chen Ping'an, wouldn’t even be able to strut around! Goodness, a disciple of the Sage of Literature, right? Zuoyou’s little brother, isn’t it? Do you know why the Sword Qi Pavilion hasn’t hung up the portraits of the two sword immortals in the past years? You’re the son-in-law of the Ning family, a true child of destiny. If not, why don’t you tell everyone?”

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine, slowly setting his chopsticks down on the dish.

The tavern staff dropped the paper and pulled out another, shaking it open, “Anyone discussing Ning Yao’s parents shall receive a punch, and pleading for mercy will be useless.”

The young man glanced sideways, laughing heartily, “No wonder you’re a scholar from the Sage of Literature; you’ve got quite the insight to guess all this! So, do you want to punch me to death?”

He raised his arm and smashed his wine bowl into pieces, furious, “I’d rather not drink your Ning family’s wine!”

Holding the bowl that still had more than half full, Chen Ping'an slowly stood up.

The young man stretched his neck, pointing at his head, “Come on, give me a punch. If you have the ability, hit me here.”

He laughed mockingly, “I don’t know if both times I came to the Sword Qi Great Wall coincided with the breaks between major battles; maybe the disciple of the Sage of Literature guessed it beforehand? Anyway, it’s all abilities. You’ve won four matches, so what’s wrong with killing me, a mere observer of the Sea Observation realm? Isn’t that a show of strength? You think Chen Ping'an is here to play around? The demons fear coming to attack the city because they’ve seen you! I see your strength is likely greater than all the sword immortals combined; don’t you think so, Chen Ping'an?!”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the shattered pieces of the bowl on the ground.

The young sword cultivator widened his eyes, “Wine money? I have it! I’ve been to the city wall once, and to the south once; I didn’t make much, but enough to buy you a few bowls of your rotten wine!”

He was about to reach into his sleeve for some divine money when suddenly he heard the man in the blue robe say, “You don’t need to pay for this bowl of wine.”

The observer of the Sea Observation realm laughed heartily, convinced that the man wouldn’t dare to punch him, and prepared to say more.

But in an instant…

The young man's head was struck with a punch.

He flipped upside down, with his head toward the ground and his legs in the air, dying instantly, collapsing to the ground. Not only was he dead, but his spirit was shattered; he died without a chance to recover.

Chen Ping'an, with the wine bowl still in his left hand, pointed at the corpse with his right, smiling, “You owe a bowl of wine to the demon clan. In the next great battle in the south, the desolate world must repay Chen Ping'an!”

Chen Ping'an raised his wine bowl high, looking around, laughing, “A small cup, a large bowl, how many drinks are there? Let’s drink to the world’s troubles! Who among you future sword immortals wishes to join me, Chen Ping'an, for a drink?!”

All the tavern patrons and those crouching sword cultivators stood up, wine bowls in hand, ready to drink. 

Chen Ping'an gazed into the distance, proclaiming loudly, “I, Sword Qi Great Wall! If there are sword immortals who resent not being able to kill enough, let’s drink!” 

Today, there were many sword cultivators and sword immortals drinking at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 693: Drinking in the Mundane World**   

It had been ten days since the last incident, and Chen Ping’an returned to the tavern for a drink. As the New Year approached, the atmosphere in the Sword Qi Great Wall was far from the festive spirit found in the Haoran realm.  

The tavern’s head, Diezhang, had gained notoriety thanks to the second shopkeeper's influence. He had learned a lot about the business from Chen Ping’an and had become increasingly adept at managing guests, no longer shying away from bold decisions.  

If someone were to ask, “Head shopkeeper, are you treating us today? We’ve made quite a bit of money from the gods, after all!”  

Diezhang would respond, “You sword immortals spend money drinking wine; why should others treat you?”  

Laughter erupted around the tables, but Diezhang was unfazed.  

After greeting Diezhang and familiar patrons, Chen Ping’an moved a small stool to sit in the corner of the street. Today, however, no one came to listen to the storyteller; many young boys and girls, upon seeing the figure in the green shirt, hesitated and chose to take a longer route.  

Except for a small child holding a jar, who had been left at home by his parents. Zhang Jiazhen was off working elsewhere, while the others didn’t dare approach.  

It wasn’t that they thought Chen Ping’an was a bad person; rather, he had killed someone in the tavern, and some children or their elders had witnessed it firsthand.  

This was human nature, and Chen Ping’an didn’t find it surprising, let alone disappointing. He sat for a while, basking in the warm winter sun, munching on sunflower seeds, then lifted his stool and returned to the tavern. He didn’t help out, instead sitting at the counter to balance the accounts. When Diezhang had a moment between serving guests, he came over, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Business is fine.”  

Chen Ping’an closed the account book, opened his palm, and gently wiped the abacus, then looked up with a smile and asked, “Have you been wanting to ask me whether that person was truly a spy for the demon clan? Regardless of the truth, as Diezhang, a friend of Ning Yao and Chen Ping’an, do you want me to give you a clear answer?”  

Diezhang shook his head without hesitation, “I don’t want to ask that; I already have my own answer.”  

Chen Ping’an, skillfully clicking the abacus, slowly said, “When the disparity in strength is vast, or when the opponent’s tactics are deep, if you lose, you may accept it. You might not admit it verbally, but internally, you know. I’ve lost before, not just once, and quite miserably. However, upon reflection, I’ve gained a great deal. What I fear most are the tactics that you clearly see through but can still be genuinely malicious. The opponent has no intention of gaining anything; they’re just toying with you.”  

Chen Ping’an hadn’t yet said everything he wanted to say. The wild realm would soon launch an all-out siege, and whether it was the next battle or not, it wouldn’t be far off. Thus, some insignificant pawns in this city could be recklessly squandered.  

This also served as a reminder for some key hidden pieces lurking deeper.  

Chen Ping’an glanced outside the tavern, “Someone is building up forces behind the scenes. If I let my guard down, thinking that the schemes of the Sword Qi Great Wall are on a completely different level than those of the Haoran realm, then I’m destined to suffer, and it will drag those around me down as well. That mastermind hiding behind the scenes is targeting my weaknesses. They’ve noticed I prefer doing things the right way, so they deliberately allow me to win small victories.”  

Diezhang laughed, “Small victories? Pang Yuanji and Qi Shou would jump up and curse. Not to mention Qi Shou, but Pang Yuanji certainly wouldn’t come back for drinks again; he wouldn’t even want to buy the cheapest wine.”  

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Then it’s a small victory. Pang Yuanji and Qi Shou know, the observing sword immortal knows; those who should know all know. Because I’m not a true sword cultivator, and I’m not a native of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The words of that person before, while intended to be malicious, did hit the nail on the head. Unfortunately, words alone, barring any accidents, find it difficult to win against me. In the previous encounters with Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji, I’ve won more due to the ‘accidents’ that occurred.”  

Diezhang sighed, “Chen Ping’an, do you know how terrifying you are?”  

It was like two players in a game, with one side guessing where the other would move each time. How would the other side feel?  

Some things had already happened, but there were still some things that even Chen Sanqiu and the others didn’t know. For instance, when Chen Ping’an wrote and asked Diezhang to fetch paper, he had jokingly mentioned that this time he was waiting for rabbits to come by, believing that the opponent was definitely young, with a low cultivation base, but had certainly been to the southern battlefield. Thus, allowing many ordinary sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall to “empathize” and develop feelings of compassion and camaraderie against a common enemy. Perhaps this person was a well-regarded “ordinary person” in the markets of the Sword Qi Great Wall, someone who had long helped the elderly and children in the neighborhood. After this person’s death, the mastermind wouldn’t need to stir the pot; they just needed to observe from the sidelines. Otherwise, they wouldn’t take the patrolling sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall seriously. Naturally, a grassroots opinion would rise, gradually spreading from taverns and shops to the grand mansions, reaching the ears of many sword immortals. Some would ignore it, while others would remember it quietly. However, Chen Ping’an mentioned that this was just the worst outcome and might not come true; besides, the situation wasn’t so dire, as it was merely a minor test by the mastermind behind the scenes.  

At this moment, Diezhang had originally worried that Chen Ping’an would be angry, but he didn’t expect Chen Ping’an to still be smiling, and it didn’t seem forced; it was as if this statement was already within his expectations.  

This was the second time Chen Ping’an had heard a similar sentiment.  

“To be able to say this in front of me means you truly consider me a friend.”  

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Those who oppose me should feel this way.”  

Diezhang said, “With you by Ning Yao’s side, I feel more at ease.”  

Chen Ping’an laughed, “After the next great battle in the south, if you still wish to say this, I will feel quite reassured as well.”  

Diezhang suddenly grew serious.  

Chen Ping’an nodded and softly said, “Yes, this is also something that the mastermind behind the scenes intends. First, to determine whether I, Chen Ping’an, a disciple of the Scholar, son-in-law of the Ning family, would really climb the city wall and fight alongside the sword cultivators. Second, whether I dare to leave the city to head to the southern battlefield and fight demons. Third, after leaving the city, whether I would choose to prioritize my own safety or fight with all my might—whether I would strive to survive and then discuss the aftermath, or seek face for myself and the Ning family, even at the cost of my life simply to prove myself. Of course, the best outcome would be for that Chen Ping’an to die gloriously on the southern battlefield. If the mastermind is in a good mood afterward, they might even arrange for someone to speak a few good words for me.”  

Chen Ping’an joked, “You’ve treated that chair my master sat in as a family heirloom, and now it’s been stored in your little home. Do you think that the small stools on either side of the Scholar can be sat on by just anyone?”  

Diezhang’s mood was heavy as he picked up a jar of wine, broke the seal, and poured two cups, taking a big gulp himself, looking sullen.  

Chen Ping’an raised his cup, took a sip, and smiled, “Drink less; even as shopkeepers, we still have to pay for our wine.”  

Diezhang hesitated, wanting to say something.  

Chen Ping’an asked, “Any more questions? Feel free to ask.”  

Diezhang softly inquired, “Who was the first to raise the cup? Was it Tuo’er?”  

Chen Ping’an laughed heartily, waving his hand, “No.”  

Then Chen Ping’an pointed at Diezhang, “Head shopkeeper, just focus on being a businessman. You’re really not suited for these schemes of the heart. If I were to act that way, wouldn’t that make all the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall—especially those sword immortals watching from a distance—look like fools who only know how to practice swords and don’t understand human nature? Some things seem perfect and beneficial, but in reality, they absolutely cannot be done. Being too deliberate only leads to ugliness. For example, my initial plan was merely to avoid losing. Killing that person was already a win; seeking more would only add unnecessary embellishments, giving others a reason to look down on me.”  

Diezhang sighed heavily, his expression complex, lifting his wine cup, mimicking Chen Ping’an, “Drink to the mundane matters of the world!”  

Chen Ping’an smiled and raised his cup to clink with his, “Thank you, Head Shopkeeper, for treating me to wine.”  

---

West of the city stood a hidden official’s winter retreat, and to the east was actually a summer retreat, both modest in size yet costing a fortune.  

Today, within the winter retreat’s main hall, the Hidden Official stood upon an exquisitely crafted grand chair made of red wood, a celestial artifact from the Xiaoxiao Continent of the Haoran realm, its patterns resembling flowing water and clouds.  

In the hall were two local sword immortals assisting the Hidden Official. The man was named Zhu An, and the woman was named Luo Shan, both aged jade purity cultivators.  

Additionally, a Yuan Ying cultivator responsible for intelligence gathering was meticulously reporting the details of the tavern incident, having traced the lineage of young sword cultivator Huang Zhou, revealing details about his masters, friends, and familiar celestial elders, explaining everything to sword immortal Zhu An. The Hidden Official, however, had never been interested in such matters.  

Also present were Pang Yuanji and a Confucian gentleman named Wang Zai, who had some ties to the previous ruler of the Sword Qi Great Wall.  

The Hidden Official closed her eyes, pacing back and forth on the chair, her form swaying, her hands gripping two braids like horns, as if in a trance.  

Sword immortal Zhu An listened to the subordinate’s report while flipping through the intelligence paper, seeking precision, resulting in a lengthy document, which is why the Hidden Official never touched such things.  

The female sword immortal, Luo Shan, donned a round-collared brocade robe, adorned with a striking red flower on her head, making her particularly eye-catching.  

Regarding the intelligence matter, the gentleman Wang Zai was akin to a spokesman for the Haoran realm court, lacking the qualifications to participate in specific affairs but begrudgingly having the right to offer suggestions.  

In the Hidden Official’s words, it was necessary to give these outsiders holding the imperial edict a chance to speak, and whether to listen or not depended on her mood.  

After listening to the intelligence report, Wang Zai asked, “Is there any conclusive evidence proving this Huang Zhou is a spy for the demon clan? Will Chen Ping’an face accusations of indiscriminate killing? Even if he were a demon spy, shouldn’t we handle it ourselves? If not, isn’t this just a dispute between young people, leading to the loss of innocent lives?”  

Pang Yuanji frowned but said nothing, lowering his head to drink.  

As the sole direct disciple of the Hidden Official, Pang Yuanji’s words often carried more weight than those of the two senior sword immortals, yet he was not keen on mingling in such murky affairs, focusing solely on his cultivation.  

Luo Shan calmly stated, “Evil people should be dealt with harshly, making them regret their actions. In the Sword Qi Great Wall, one shouldn’t hold back. Even low-level sword cultivators can curse Dong Sangu, as long as Dong Sangu doesn’t mind. But if Dong Sangu strikes, it would simply be a death wasted. Chen Ping’an is clearly waiting for others to seek trouble with him. Huang Zhou should have known better; upon seeing the first piece of paper, he should have known when to back off. Does it really matter if he’s a demon spy? If he’s foolish enough to die, he can’t blame others for being too harsh. As for Chen Ping’an, does he truly think he’s a sword cultivator of the Sword Qi Great Wall? What a bold claim! In the next great battle in the south, I will have someone specifically record Chen Ping’an’s demon-slaying exploits.”  

Zhu An’s expression darkened.  

According to the rules, they must ask.  

However, that young man was far too skilled at handling people, his words and actions flawless, and he had a powerful backing.  

Wang Zai stated, “The Scholar is no longer the Scholar. Moreover, Chen Ping’an is a disciple of the Confucian sect, and his actions should adhere to proper conduct; he shouldn’t kill at will. Even if that old gentleman in the Confucian Temple no longer has a divine seat, I would still speak plainly. If the two sword immortals find it inappropriate to intervene, perhaps we can have a younger generation question Chen Ping’an.”  

Zhu An asked, “Should we question him here or at the Ning residence?”  

Wang Zai picked up on the undertone of Zhu An's words and agreed to compromise, saying, “I can visit him in person, so as not to make Chen Ping’an feel too uncomfortable.”  

Luo Shan tugged at her lips, “That’s good; otherwise, I’d worry that as soon as Chen Ping’an steps into the retreat, the great sword immortal would rush over.”  

Pang Yuanji sighed, putting away his wine jug, smiling, “Is Huang Zhou really a pawn inserted by the demon clan? Do we not know that ordinary sword cultivators have their doubts?”  

Wang Zai said, “I’m merely discussing the matter. Huang Zhou, in the Sword Qi Great Wall’s Dayu Ridge Alley, has an excellent reputation, and I’ve already thoroughly reviewed his battle records; he deserves high praise. Allow me to say something unpleasant: sword cultivators like Huang Zhou, though not highly ranked and rarely killing enemies, are the foundation of the Sword Qi Great Wall. If we merely brush this aside without any action, I dare say it will only leave many ordinary sword cultivators disheartened. Clear rewards and punishments are the ironclad rules of the Sword Qi Great Wall; does being a disciple of the Sage or a brother of the great sword immortal exempt one from this?”  

At this point, Wang Zai’s expression was resolute as he looked toward the sword immortals Zhu An and Luo Shan, embodying a spirit of “I will go forth even if thousands oppose.”  

The Hidden Official opened her eyes, standing at the edge of the chair, swaying back and forth like a tumbler. She didn’t even glance at the scholar, lazily saying, “If there were ten thousand people like Huang Zhou in the city, I would slay nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine of them. The great sword immortal would scold me for dereliction of duty and punish me with years of not drinking wine.”  

As soon as she spoke, both sword immortals Zhu An and Luo Shan immediately stood up.  

The Yuan Ying sword cultivator’s expression turned solemn, listening attentively as if awaiting a decree.  

The Hidden Official stretched out her palm and yawned, “Have your minds been dulled by the series of recent battles? Eat more, drink more, and don’t just practice swordplay all day; you might end up with a twisted mind. You lot are fine, but for some, their brains have been ruined by reading; I can’t save them.”  

The gentleman Wang Zai maintained a neutral expression.  

The Hidden Official nodded to herself, “Though I’ve never liked that Chen Ping’an, now that I compare him to others, he seems much more agreeable. Why is that?”  

She pointed at Luo Shan, “You explain.”  

Luo Shan replied with a smile, “Tonight’s moonlight is splendid.”  

The Hidden Official nodded, “That makes sense.”  

Wang Zai stood still.  

The Hidden Official was somewhat impressed by the scholars' thick skins, casting a glance at Zhu An, who immediately found an excuse and took Wang Zai away from the discussion hall.  

Luo Shan also took the Yuan Ying sword cultivator away.  

Only the master and disciple remained.  

Pang Yuanji chuckled, “Master, is the second sage lineage really so unwelcoming toward the Scholar lineage?”  

The Hidden Official waved her hand, and Pang Yuanji approached the grand chair, only to have the Hidden Official grasp him tightly and twist, “Yuanji, you’re the one who’s been practicing swordplay to the point of dulling your mind!”  

Pang Yuanji had no qualms with his master, breaking free from her grip while rubbing his cheek, helplessly saying, “Master, please enlighten me.”  

The Hidden Official rolled her eyes, “Why did I take you as my foolish disciple? Do you really think Wang Zai is targeting Chen Ping’an? He’s actually helping us, proving Chen Ping’an’s innocence together. Can’t you see how simple this is? I deliberately won’t let him have his way; after all, that Chen Ping’an is a clever one, and these things are meaningless to him.”  

Pang Yuanji pondered thoughtfully and nodded, though he felt a bit angry—this Wang Zai dared to scheme against his master?  

The Hidden Official waved her hand, “What’s this? Wang Zai is clearly suspicious of the Dong family and us. Besides Chen Qingdu and the three seated sages, Wang Zai suspects all major families, including me, the Hidden Official. Do you think that Confucian sage who lost to me would send a fool to the Sword Qi Great Wall to lose face again?”  

Pang Yuanji smiled bitterly, “I’m not skilled in these matters.”  

The Hidden Official made sword gestures with her hands, waving them wildly, “Why would you need skills in that? You’re the next Hidden Official, swinging your sword with swiftness; just be able to kill people.”  

Pang Yuanji remarked, “But Master is very skilled.”  

She replied, “I’m your master.”  

Pang Yuanji nodded, “That makes sense.”  

The Hidden Official jumped up, “You shameless one! Copying my speech? Pay up! You can use wine to settle your debts!”  

Pang Yuanji tossed a jug of bamboo sea cave wine her way, which the Hidden Official tucked into her sleeve, secretly hoarding it. Though she couldn’t drink, she could stash it away.  

---

As the New Year approached, Ning Yao asked Chen Ping’an why he hadn’t prepared spring couplets or door gods. Back in the small town of Lizhu Cave, Ning Yao had enjoyed visiting homes and found it quite festive, thus feeling nostalgic.  

Chen Ping’an joked, “Is there even a place selling these in the Sword Qi Great Wall?” Ning Yao replied that he could write and draw them himself.  

Chen Ping’an stated that when in a new place, one should follow local customs and not fuss over these things.  

Ning Yao grew a bit irritated, wondering why she should care about their opinions.  

Chen Ping’an insisted that she should care.  

Ning Yao genuinely became angry at this, and Chen Ping’an elaborated on his reasons, finally saying that there was no rush on this matter; he intended to stay in the Sword Qi Great Wall for a long time and might even have opportunities to sell spring couplets and door gods in the future, just as the taverns had gotten used to hanging couplets.  

Only then did Ning Yao relent.  

After healing from his injuries, Chen Ping’an went back to the city wall to practice swordplay with his senior brother.  

This time, he was clever and brought along a jar of medicinal ointment, intending to treat his wounds on the city wall so that he wouldn’t look too alarming. After all, it was the New Year. However, things didn’t go as planned. Late at night, after Ning Yao finished training at the Dragon Slaying Terrace pavilion, and still finding no one, she went to the city wall only to discover Chen Ping’an lying ten steps away, bandaging himself. It seemed he had sustained quite a severe injury; otherwise, with Chen Ping’an’s usual habit of pushing his body to the limits, he would have been fine and would have returned to the Ning residence on a talisman boat.  

Ning Yao sat beside Chen Ping’an, turned to glare at him, and complained, “It’s the New Year!”  

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I’ll pay more attention next time.”  

Chen Ping’an secretly found it amusing.  

Finally, Chen Ping’an said, “Once, a wise man asked on the riverside, leaving behind one hundred seventy-three questions for future generations. Later, a scholar in his study crafted answers to those questions. You can look into this matter.”  

Chen Ping’an agreed, thinking he could ask Chen Sanqiu for help; that guy loved collecting books.  

Taking out a talisman boat, Ning Yao piloted it back to the Ning residence alongside Chen Ping’an.  

The Sword Qi Great Wall didn’t have family reunion dinners, but in the Ning residence, Chen Ping’an personally cooked that day, letting Grandma Bai have a break and preparing a sumptuous dinner.  

Friends would also have their own friends.  

Apart from Dong Huafu, who was rather reclusive and had no peers to speak of, Chen Sanqiu had his own little group of friends, while Chen Ping’an’s circle was broader.  

In the first month, Chen Sanqiu brought three close friends to drink at Diezhang’s tavern.  

The four of them sat at a table when a young gentleman named Fan Dache got completely drunk, tears and snot flowing freely, wishing to ascend to the heavens. Chen Sanqiu felt helpless, and the other two young men, who were similarly well-off, could do nothing. Moreover, the couple among them dared not speak much, especially since Fan Dache’s beloved girl, who was not from a good family, had unexpectedly rejected him for another wealthy young man, and they were already discussing marriage. This matter left Chen Sanqiu and his friends flabbergasted, unable to understand why the young woman named Yu Qia chose to leave Fan Dache.  

Fan Dache, even more confused, drank himself into a stupor, rambling incoherently.  

Seeing Chen Ping’an, Fan Dache shouted, “Oh, isn’t that our second shopkeeper? What a rare sight! Come over for a drink, let’s drink!”  

Chen Ping’an had just come here alone to settle accounts with Diezhang and gestured to Chen Sanqiu to help intervene. He felt somewhat helpless, having only met Fan Dache and Yu Qia a couple of times without much interaction, so he simply sat on the bench beside Chen Sanqiu, opened a jug of wine, and quietly drank. Fan Dache was too drunk to care about anything, wallowing in his sorrow, tears flowing freely, clearly heartbroken.  

The most pitiful was that after drinking so much, he still hadn’t passed out, unable to forget his woes.  

Sometimes, drinking to drown sorrows only sprinkled salt on the wound; the more it hurt, the more one wanted to drink, seeking to numb the heart.  

Chen Sanqiu didn’t really want Chen Ping’an to say anything, he just wanted someone to drink with.  

Listening carefully, Chen Ping’an roughly understood the situation. However, since their relationship was shallow, he didn’t want to say much.  

What could make Fan Dache so heart-wrenchingly torn, even after drinking so much, was Yu Qia, the woman he admired. Chen Ping’an had taken note of her; she was a woman who never got drunk when drinking, with an excellent temperament. Although her background wasn’t great, she had a rare scholarly air among the women of the Sword Qi Great Wall, along with a bit of boldness. Chen Ping’an remembered her because she had once made a gesture that left an impression. Back then, when Chen Sanqiu, Fan Dache, and the others were gathered around the table, they encountered a sword immortal, and Yu Qia, upon recognizing him, stood up to toast. She naturally reached out to support the sword immortal’s arm, a gesture that was quite discreet. Even Chen Ping’an didn’t find it inappropriate, nor did the sword immortal harbor any thoughts about it. Yet, Chen Ping’an remembered it clearly, for he had seen many women like her at various tables in the Haoran realm—elegant in demeanor and composed in speech, easily gaining admiration from men. Such a scene didn’t imply that Yu Qia was frivolous; on the contrary, it was simply a highly nuanced display of social grace.  

Chen Ping’an didn’t need to say whether he accepted this or not; he merely understood that life is always on the path of cultivation, and everyone has their own means of surviving.  

Many actions and behaviors, unseen by others, are merely protective charms quietly acquired by some individuals for their own benefit.  

However, Fan Dache clearly didn’t understand this, nor had he ever paid attention. Perhaps in his mind, his admired woman was always someone so understanding.  

Ultimately, Fan Dache liked her, undeniably devotedly, but he didn’t truly understand her preferences or the difficulties she faced in her social dealings.  

Listening to Fan Dache’s words and hearing how Yu Qia was leaving him, he was utterly confused, asking if he had done something wrong and if he could change.  

Yet Yu Qia remained firm, simply saying they weren’t suitable. Thus, in Fan Dache’s drunken ramblings today, there was a line, “What do you mean we aren’t suitable? How come I only realized today that we aren’t suitable?”  

Suddenly, Fan Dache shouted, “Chen Ping’an, you’re not allowed to think of Yu Qia as a bad woman! You absolutely must not think that way!”  

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Alright.”  

Fan Dache raised his white bowl and drank half of it, then stared at Chen Ping’an, sitting beside Chen Sanqiu, his eyes somewhat glazed, tremblingly asking, “Tell me, where did I go wrong? Why did Yu Qia say she was marrying someone else? Is the matter of love really that the good person suffers? Just because that bastard can sweet-talk better? Can he win a woman’s heart more easily? I poured my heart out for her; how did I fall short? My family is strict, and while my resources aren’t abundant, I’ve always borrowed money from Sanqiu to buy her things she likes, right?”  

Fan Dache paused for a moment, then continued, “Chen Ping’an, you’re an outsider; you can see things clearly. Tell me, where exactly did I go wrong?”  

Chen Ping’an asked, “Does she know you borrowed money from Chen Sanqiu?”  

Fan Dache was taken aback, furious, “How the hell would I know if she knows! If I knew, Yu Qia would be sitting next to me right now! Does it matter if she knows or not? Yu Qia should be here, drinking with me…”  

By the end, his voice trailed off, the young man left only in sorrow.  

Chen Ping’an took a sip of wine, set down his cup, and softly asked, “Does it truly not matter whether she knows?”  

Fan Dache suddenly raised his voice, “Chen Ping’an, don’t spout nonsense! You stand there without feeling any pain, while you and Ning Yao like each other. You’re both celestial beings; you don’t know the struggles of daily life!”  

Chen Sanqiu was about to remind Fan Dache to stop being foolish, but Chen Ping’an gently pressed his arm, shaking his head to signal it was okay.  

Chen Ping’an didn’t continue elaborating; he simply drank silently.  

But Fan Dache seemed to finally find a way to relieve his worries, starting to target Chen Ping’an with more nonsense, fortunately only regarding love matters.  

Chen Sanqiu’s expression darkened, and even Diezhang furrowed his brow, wondering if he should just knock him out.  

Chen Ping’an maintained a calm expression, waiting for Fan Dache to finish his rant, which he himself felt was unjustifiable, before bursting into tears.  

Only then did Chen Ping’an say, “If you didn’t do well and couldn’t keep her, stop making excuses. Don’t blame yourself for being a good person. Feeling infatuated with a woman isn’t a mistake; it’s about being gentle and considerate, not about being someone who can readily sweet-talk. If your vision is poor, just admit it. Many people like someone, but apart from liking the other person, they’re also in love with themselves, intoxicated by their feelings, and make a show of it for themselves. Even if they’re blind or struck by luck to like someone, they have no idea how the other person thinks or whether they’re worth such devotion. They just prioritize their own feelings first.”  

Fan Dache slammed the table, “Shut up!”  

Chen Ping’an replied calmly, “When it comes to getting hurt afterward, people drink again, giving themselves a few excuses. What good is the true heart of a good person? You, Fan Dache, have bad luck, but if your family background wasn’t solid, you would have more excuses, feeling as if not keeping a woman is a disaster. As for whether you can take responsibility for yourself in a love affair before you can truly take responsibility for a woman, is that even worth pondering? I don’t think so. If you feel devastated, why bother thinking about whether you’ve erred? How can you still feel for yourself?”  

Fan Dache swayed and stood up, his face contorted, bloodshot eyes, panting heavily, “Chen, let’s fight?!”  

Chen Ping’an waved his hand, “No fighting. I’m only saying a few unkind words out of consideration for your friendship with Chen Sanqiu.”  

Chen Ping’an drank the remaining wine in his bowl, poured another cup, and drank again, “If I’ve spoken too much, just consider it drunken talk; I apologize for that.”  

Fan Dache laughed heartily, “I can’t afford your apology, Chen Ping’an!”  

The other two friends of Fan Dache also looked at Chen Ping’an with resentment.  

Where do you find someone who gives advice like this? Isn’t that adding fuel to the fire?  

Fan Dache stared at Chen Ping’an intently, “You’ve experienced how many things, and you’re qualified to speak these principles?”  

Chen Sanqiu told Fan Dache, “Enough! Stop being a drunken fool!”  

Fan Dache felt despondent, staggering, he barely steadied himself against the table, choked out, “Sanqiu.”  

Chen Sanqiu sighed, standing up, “Alright, let’s settle up.”  

Chen Ping’an looked apologetically at Chen Sanqiu, who smiled and nodded.  

Chen Ping’an left the table and walked toward Diezhang.  

Suddenly, Fan Dache picked up a wine bowl and threw it at Chen Ping’an.  

Chen Ping’an slowed his pace but didn’t turn around. Chen Sanqiu had already circled the table and grabbed Fan Dache, angrily shouting, “Fan Dache! Have you lost your mind from drinking?!”  

Diezhang was about to intervene, but Chen Ping’an shook his head from the side, facing the table.  

Regardless of whether the sadness was justified, when someone was down in the dumps, their sadness was always sadness.  

Fan Dache struggled desperately, shouting at the figure in the green shirt, “Chen Ping’an! You’re nothing! You don’t understand Yu Qia at all! You dare to say that about her, and I won’t let this go!”  

Chen Ping’an turned around and said, “Let’s talk again once you’re sober.”  

Unintentionally, Fan Dache bumped his elbow into Chen Sanqiu’s chest while breaking free, clenching his fists, his eyes red, breathing heavily, “You can say whatever you want, but you can’t say a word against Yu Qia!”  

Chen Ping’an turned his back again, “I’m speaking calmly with you, not because you’re correct, but simply because I was taught manners.”  

Diezhang observed Chen Ping’an’s back.  

At this moment, there was a hint of fear, much like how she normally felt when facing high-ranking sword immortals.  

A Li had once said that those who flaunt their authority don’t need to be feared; the ones to truly respect are those who usually seem easy to talk to.  

Because the so-called character flaws are not just small stones that get stuck in one’s shoes, making every step painful. Rather, they’re like smooth pebbles in a stream, appearing pliable but can truly hurt when bitten down upon.  

Chen Sanqiu was also furious, pushing Fan Dache’s shoulder, sending him stumbling forward a few steps, “Let’s go; fight! You can beat yourself up! If you get yourself beaten to death or maimed, I’ll just consider it bad luck for having a friend like you, and I’ll still carry you home!”  

Fan Dache suddenly stood still, as if blown by the wind, his mind clearing, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.  

Unexpectedly, Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Don’t take it to heart; who hasn’t had a drunken moment? Just remember to settle up.”  

Chen Sanqiu regretted not stopping Fan Dache from inviting Chen Ping’an to drink; now he had to drag Fan Dache home.  

If Ning Yao found out, it would be the end for him; who knew if he could still visit the Ning residence in the future.  

Diezhang approached Chen Ping’an, asking, “Aren’t you angry?”  

Chen Ping’an squatted down, picking up the shards of the white bowl, smiling, “What good would anger do? If it were to happen every time…”  

Diezhang also squatted down to help clean up the mess but found there was no further text, turning to gaze curiously.  

Chen Ping’an smiled, “As long as the one speaking has no ill intentions, there are no harsh words in this world. If there are, it’s simply that one hasn’t cultivated their heart enough.”  

Diezhang stifled a laugh, “What about that person you killed with a punch?”  

Chen Ping’an replied with utmost righteousness, “Not to mention that person had malicious intent from the start, and I never claimed my heart was enough.”  

Having cleaned up the shards, Chen Ping’an continued tidying the table, aside from the half-finished jug of wine, the other jug he had brought along remained unopened. Chen Sanqiu and the others had already settled the bill, so they were quite considerate.  

In a good mood, Chen Ping’an poured himself a cup of wine, planning to take the remaining jug to the Ning residence as a gift for Senior Nalan.  

The head shopkeeper, Diezhang, pretended not to see.  

Chen Ping’an sat alone at the table, drinking wine. Another year had gone by, welcoming yet another.  

Year after year, life goes on, seeking peace and safety.

 ### Chapter 694: Chen Qingdu, Get the Hell Away from Me

Chen Ping'an sipped his wine, watching the busy tavern keeper bustle about. A sense of guilt washed over him as he shook the wine jar, realizing there were only about two bowls left. The large white bowls they used here weren’t exactly big.

He waved over Die Zhuang to join him for a drink. Once Die Zhuang was seated, Chen Ping'an poured a bowl of wine and smiled, "I don’t come to the tavern often, but I wanted to take this opportunity to talk to you about a few things. Fan Dacheng is just a friend of a friend. Today at the drinking table, he’s not really looking for any profound truths; he’s just been bottling up too much frustration and needs an outlet. Chen Sanqiu and the others, being his friends, don’t know how to broach the subject. Some feelings are like old wine—when they’re suddenly uncorked, they can hit hard. If Fan Dacheng goes down south for a brawl next time, the chances of him getting hurt are quite high. He might think that this way, he can live in her heart forever. Of course, that’s just my speculation; I tend to think the worst. But after taking so much abuse from Fan Dacheng and breaking one of our bowls, I’ll have to settle the score with Chen Sanqiu later. Die Zhuang, you’re different. Not only are you a friend of Ning Yao, but you’re also my friend, so I won’t hold back in what I say next."

Die Zhuang joked, "Don’t worry, I’m not Fan Dacheng. I won’t go crazy with the wine; I wouldn’t want to break a bowl or anything."

Chen Ping'an got straight to the point, "What are your thoughts on the Sword Immortal? When you see them wielding their swords from afar, and then come here to drink, how does that feel?"

Die Zhuang pondered for a moment. "Respect."

After a brief hesitation, she added, "Actually, it’s more about fear. When I was young, I had a rough time with some lower-tier sword cultivators. It was pretty miserable. At that time, they seemed like divine beings in my eyes. I’m not ashamed to admit that whenever I saw them on the road back then, I’d be so nervous that my face would go pale. It was only after meeting A Liang that things got better. Of course, I want to become a Sword Immortal, but if I were to die on that path, I wouldn’t regret it. Don’t worry; once I reach the Nascent Soul stage, I’ll become a Sword Immortal. I’ve already planned what I want to do at each realm. At the very least, I could have bought a big mansion years ago—that’s something to respect."

Chen Ping'an raised his wine bowl and clinked it with hers. Then, he smiled and said, "Good, I think that’s a reasonable perspective. Admiring the strong while being compassionate towards the weak means you’re walking a balanced path. Not just me and Ning Yao, but even Sanqiu and the others are worried about you pushing yourself too hard in every battle, valuing your life so little. Yan Fatty had a misunderstanding with you back then and hasn’t dared to say much since; others fear to speak up too. This is similar to how Chen Sanqiu treats Fan Dacheng. But seriously, don’t talk lightly about life and death. If you can avoid it, don’t die. Well, these matters are often beyond our control. I’ve been there myself, so I’m not in a position to say much. Anyway, the next time we leave the city, I’ll be like Yan Fatty and the others—trying to catch a few more glimpses of the back of your head. Come, let’s toast to the back of our great tavern keeper."

Die Zhuang raised her wine bowl, gently clinking it against his before taking a drink.

Chen Ping'an continued, "Now, this next question might be a bit troublesome. Let’s agree beforehand that after I finish speaking, I’m still the second tavern keeper around here, and we’re still friends."

Die Zhuang laughed, "Go ahead. Guarantees don’t matter; women change their minds faster than you men drink."

Chen Ping'an felt a bit helpless and asked, "Do you like that Confucian gentleman who takes away a long sword infused with righteous energy? Is it just his character that you like, or do you admire his status as a sage? Do you ever hope that one day he might take you away from the Sword Qi Great Wall to explore the world of Haoran?"

Die Zhuang's cheeks flushed slightly as she lowered her voice, nodding, "Both. I like his character and demeanor, especially the scholarly air about him. I truly admire him as a sage! How impressive! Now he’s a gentleman—I care about that a lot! After getting to know A Liang and Ning Yao, I’ve long wanted to see the world of Haoran. If I could go with him, that would be the best!"

Die Zhuang quickly brightened up, "But if that day really comes when he likes me back, I would have to become a Sword Immortal first before I’d consider going to the world of Haoran! Otherwise, even if he asks me, I wouldn’t leave the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Chen Ping'an clicked his tongue, "Whether he likes you or not is still uncertain. Why think so far ahead?"

Die Zhuang took a big gulp of wine and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, her spirits high. "Is it a crime to think about it?"

Chen Ping'an hesitated, "Let me share a story with you. It’s not hearsay, nor did I witness it myself; you can just take it as a tale from a book. After you hear it, at least you can avoid one of the worst possibilities. The rest isn’t much use and doesn’t really apply to you and that gentleman."

It was a story about a lovesick scholar and a ghost bride in a mountain landscape.

Those deeply in love often find themselves accompanied by suffering. The term "infatuation" is often neighbors with "betrayal."

Chen Ping'an certainly didn’t want Die Zhuang to end up with a fate like that scholar. He hoped that lovers everywhere could be united in the end. 

However, there was a prerequisite: don’t be foolish in choosing the wrong person. This kind of foolishness isn’t just about whether the other person is worth liking. It’s more related to oneself, and the most pitiful people are those who, in the end, don’t even know why the one they loved once loved them, and ultimately, why they no longer do.

Just like when Chen Ping'an asked Fan Dacheng one question, which really implied whether Yu Qia knew that Fan Dacheng would rather borrow money from friends to buy her that coveted item. Did Fan Dacheng truly see her thoughts clearly, and did he still accept it? If he could, and if he could resolve the intricacies of this sentiment, then that would be Fan Dacheng’s capability.

If he really had no clue from start to finish, then it was evident why he would be so furious. Whether he initially understood or realized it later, he knew that Yu Qia was aware of his borrowing money from Chen Sanqiu. Yet, Yu Qia chose to accept Fan Dacheng's offering; she continued to take. Did Fan Dacheng understand what that meant? No. He might have vaguely felt that this was wrong, that it wasn’t so good, but he never knew how to confront it or resolve it.

Fan Dacheng only knew that after their separation, they were destined to drift further apart. After drinking, he felt like he could offer his heart to that girl, wanting her to see his true feelings.

If Fan Dacheng were to love a girl so unreservedly, would that be wrong? Of course not; a man who pours out his heart for the woman he loves does nothing wrong. But if you dig deeper, would he really have no fault? To love someone so deeply, shouldn’t he know who he is truly in love with?

Just as Chen Ping'an, an outsider who had only seen Yu Qia twice from afar, could see her ambition and her way of subtly ranking Fan Dacheng’s friends. Her ambition was fueled by her hope that one day, she could simply be called Yu Qia and be invited to that banquet of Sword Immortals, and she wouldn’t be seated at the lowest position but would have someone toasting to her. Yu Qia had to sit up straight, waiting for others to offer her a drink.

Chen Ping'an didn’t like this kind of girl, but he certainly didn’t harbor any dislike either. He just understood, could understand, and respected the many choices one can make in life.

Did Fan Dacheng understand? Absolutely not.

Today, he missed out, but in the future, there might be a chance encounter with the right one, where they could become a pair of fated celestial partners. But if luck didn’t favor him, he would only miss out again.

Die Zhuang listened to the end of the story, feeling indignant, and asked, "So that scholar was just trying to become a gentleman and sage of the Guanhu Academy, so he could marry that ghost bride properly?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "That’s how it’s always been; he never changed his heart. That’s why the scholar was forced to jump into the lake to end his life. Yet the ghost bride always thought he betrayed her deep feelings."

Die Zhuang's eyes were red, "How could the ending be like that? Those scholars from the academy were all scholars; how could they be so cruel?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Scholars don’t need knives to harm others. I’m telling you this story so you can think a little more. Think about it—Haoran is vast, and there are countless scholars. Are they all good people who are worthy of being called sages? If that were the case, would the Sword Qi Great Wall be what it is today?"

Die Zhuang looked up, her expression a bit strange, glancing at Chen Ping'an in his jade hairpin and green robe.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "I try to understand these things. To think and ponder more, to observe and reflect—not to become like them but, quite the opposite, to avoid becoming like them for a lifetime."

Chen Ping'an raised his wine bowl, "If there really comes a day when you and that gentleman mutually like each other, then at that time, Lady Die Zhuang, you’ll be a Sword Immortal, and you must invite me and Ning Yao to join you on your journey to Haoran. I’ll keep an eye on some scholars who are full of themselves. Whether they are so-called friends, classmates, family elders, or teachers from the academy, it’s best if they’re nice people. I believe he’s surrounded by good people; people tend to group together. But there are always some bad apples. If those guys show their true colors, I’ll know just how to use their so-called sage principles to disgust them. 

When it comes to arguments, I’m still the disciple of a sage, so I’ve learned a thing or two. A friend is someone who tells you the harsh truths and the cold realities that need to be said, but some difficult things also need to be done. The last thing I said is me boasting, so come on, let’s drink to that!"

Die Zhuang rarely smiled so brightly. She held her bowl, just about to drink when suddenly her expression darkened as she glanced at her shoulder.

Chen Ping'an said, "If you truly like someone, it’s all trivial. If you don’t like someone, having two more arms won’t help."

Die Zhuang huffed, "What good is it for a person to have an extra arm for no reason?"

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "That’s true. My flaw is that I’m not good at reasoning."

Die Zhuang’s mood lifted again, and just as she was about to clink her wine bowl with Chen Ping'an’s, he suddenly delivered a major damper, "But you and that gentleman are still in the early stages of things. Don’t think too early or too positively. Otherwise, if you end up heartbroken in the future, this little tavern will be earning me tons of wine money, and I, your second tavern keeper and friend, won’t feel good about it."

Die Zhuang’s face darkened.

Chen Ping'an sighed, "Honest advice is hard to hear; being a friend is difficult."

Die Zhuang suddenly laughed, "You’ve already said the best and the worst; thank you."

She picked up the wine jar but found there was only one bowl of wine left.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "I won’t drink anymore; Ning Yao keeps a tight rein on me."

Die Zhuang didn’t hold back and poured herself a bowl of wine, sipping it leisurely.

If a customer called for more wine, Die Zhuang would let them go fetch their own drinks and side dishes. The good thing about regular patrons was that once they got comfortable, there was no need for excessive politeness.

At first, Die Zhuang worried about providing insufficient hospitality, trying to do everything herself. It was only after she saw Chen Ping'an joking and bantering with customers, even letting them help fetch dishes, that she realized neither side felt it was inappropriate. Only then did she start to imitate him.

Die Zhuang watched Chen Ping'an as he gazed at the corner of the street. In the past, he would linger there longer, acting as a storyteller.

But today, the children were no longer gathered around the small stools.

Die Zhuang understood that deep down, Chen Ping'an must feel a sense of loss.

Yet, she still didn’t quite understand why he cared so much about such things. Was it because he came from a small, shabby town called Lihuzhou? Even though he was now seen as a celestial being by others, he could still feel attached to that shabby place? But the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, including her, all dreamed of living next to the prominent families, never wanting to return to the quiet places filled with the sounds of roosters and barking dogs.

Having said he wouldn’t drink, Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but glance at Die Zhuang, who was enjoying her wine with ease. He eyed the jar of wine meant for Elder Nalan, torn between his thoughts. Die Zhuang pretended not to notice. It wasn’t that the customers thought he was taking advantage of his position as the second tavern keeper; it was that their main tavern keeper was different.

Just when Die Zhuang thought Chen Ping'an would definitely end up paying for drinks today, he suddenly came up with a clever plan. He stood up, took his wine bowl, and dashed over to another table to trade pleasantries with a group of sword cultivators. Not only did he finish a bowl of their wine for free, but when he returned to Die Zhuang’s side, he had added a generous half bowl of wine to his empty white bowl. Sitting down, he remarked, "So warm-hearted! It's hard not to drink."

Die Zhuang sighed, "Chen Ping'an, you must be the son of a merchant with considerable cultivation, right?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "In this world, who isn’t a merchant in one way or another?"

Die Zhuang shot him a glance as he drank wine. "Didn’t you just say Ning Yao keeps a tight rein on you?"

Chen Ping'an had already had quite a bit to drink today and chuckled, "Am I not a dignified fourth-stage Qi practitioner? With a shake of my spiritual energy, the scent of wine disperses—shocking the world."

Die Zhuang also laughed, but she was determined to report him to Ning Yao.

Chen Ping'an gazed toward the main street, noticing the business of the various taverns and inns wasn’t thriving much.

He recalled how lively it was when he first observed the hustle and bustle, with everyone calling out energetically. Now, it seemed quiet, right? His own tavern hadn’t yet shown its full potential.

After Die Zhuang finished her wine, she went to attend to the customers. Her boldness still didn’t match that of the second tavern keeper.

Chen Ping'an took his time with the large bowl of wine, drinking especially slowly.

Die Zhuang simply brought him a pair of chopsticks and a plate of side dishes.

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, slowly enjoying the wine and snacks. 

As customers trickled in, Chen Ping'an gave up his table, squatting by the roadside, and of course, he didn’t forget the jar of wine that remained unopened.

Die Zhuang glanced into her bowl, which was nearly empty yet couldn’t be finished, and laughed angrily, "If you want me to treat you to wine, can’t you just say it outright?"

She was puzzled; someone who had mentioned offering two pieces of celestial weapons as dowry would really be stingy to this extent?

However, when Ning Yao privately spoke about this matter, her eyes sparkled, and even a girl like Die Zhuang felt her heart stir.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "The tavern keeper is truly wronging me."

So he went over to another table to snag half a bowl of wine again, raising his hand to indicate to Die Zhuang that he was innocent.

Die Zhuang busied herself for a while, noticing that guy was still squatting there.

Die Zhuang walked over, unable to resist asking, "Do you have something on your mind?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, then nodded, gazing into the distance. "If I have something on my mind, it’s all good things. I keep feeling like I’m dreaming, especially after seeing Fan Dacheng today. It makes me feel even more so."

He picked up a piece of side dish with his chopsticks, chewed it, and took a sip of wine, smiling brightly.

Die Zhuang pulled up a stool and sat beside him.

A customer chuckled, "Second tavern keeper, don’t harbor any ill thoughts about our Lady Die Zhuang! If you do, it’s fine; just treat me to a pot of wine worth five snowflake coins as a hush fee!"

Chen Ping'an raised a middle finger high.

Die Zhuang completely didn’t mind this. Moreover, the Sword Qi Great Wall didn’t really care about such things. No matter how meticulous Die Zhuang was, she wouldn’t be coy; if she were, that would imply she had something to hide.

Furthermore, in terms of propriety, Die Zhuang had never seen a better peer than Chen Ping'an.

The relationship between Chen Ping'an and Ning Yao was evident to everyone, friend or foe—it was obvious. He had rushed thousands of miles from the world of Haoran and was here for the second time. He would then wait for the next great battle to leave the city with her, fighting side by side. It was likely that some would gossip behind their backs, deliberately making harsh remarks, but in reality, most people knew the truth.

Chen Ping'an had drunk quite a bit today.

"When we’re interacting with people, situations, and the world, we often do so unconsciously, being self-righteous. Therefore, all the joys and sorrows around us become difficult to resolve and nurture."

"You’re young; you can learn. It’s fine to bump into walls and make mistakes repeatedly. What’s there to be afraid of? The wrong can be corrected, the good can become better. What’s there to fear? What’s truly frightening is someone like Fan Dacheng, who gets struck by heaven’s club right in the heart and becomes confused, then starts to blame heaven and earth. Do you know why Fan Dacheng insisted that I sit down for drinks and wanted me to talk a bit more instead of Chen Sanqiu? It’s because deep down, he knows he can choose not to come to this tavern anymore, but he absolutely cannot lose real friends like Chen Sanqiu."

Upon hearing this, Die Zhuang asked, "You have a pretty bad impression of Fan Dacheng, don’t you?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "You’ve got it wrong. A person who can love a woman so much like Fan Dacheng is not someone one would dislike. It’s precisely because of this that I’m willing to be the bad guy. Otherwise, do you think I’m just idly chatting without knowing what’s appropriate?"

"Delving into human hearts is not the most comfortable thing; it only makes people feel increasingly uneasy."

"But if this initial discomfort can help those around you live better and more stable lives, then in the end, you’ll also feel more at ease. So being responsible for oneself is very important. Within this, respecting every enemy is also a form of responsibility to oneself."

Die Zhuang nodded in agreement but retorted, "Alright, alright, I’ll treat you to wine!"

Chen Ping'an laughed in disbelief, setting his bowl and chopsticks down next to the side dishes and taking the wine jar with him.

As he walked, he suddenly turned to look toward the Sword Qi Great Wall, a strange feeling flashing through his mind, but he didn’t think much of it.

---

Chen Qingdu frowned deeply as he walked out of the thatched cottage, stomping his foot heavily.

The force was so great that it surpassed even when the scholar from the Confucian Academy visited the Sword Qi Great Wall!

On the city wall, a figure in white fluttered in the wind.

Standing there was an extremely tall woman, her back to the north and facing south, leaning on her sword with one hand.

Chen Qingdu watched her form swaying in the breeze, knowing it wouldn’t last long, and he let out a sigh of relief.

However, this old Sword Immortal, who had guarded this city for countless years, unexpectedly revealed an expression of profound nostalgia.

He slowly walked to the edge of the city wall, curious to ask, "Why are you here?"

She replied nonchalantly, "To see my master."

Chen Qingdu was stunned for a long moment. "What?!"

Then she said, "So you can get the hell away from me."

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 695: The Swordsmanship of the World Descends from the Heavens

The entire Sword Qi Great Wall was already trapped in the stasis of time, or else just the words of the tall woman could have destabilized the sword hearts of many sword immortals.

Of course, those nearby, such as the Hidden Official in the distance or Dong Sangu, could still act freely. However, they could no longer perceive the movements on Chen Qingdu's side. After all, with the Grand Sword Immortal's actions, anyone who dared to act recklessly would be questioning Chen Qingdu. And Chen Qingdu was never one to be overly polite; there were many sword immortals who had perished under his sword qi, not just Dong Guanpu from ten years ago.

To see Chen Qingdu draw his sword was a mark of a true sword immortal.

This was no idle joke.

Chen Qingdu was not the least bit angry. He smiled, leaped onto the wall, and sat cross-legged, gazing at the vast expanse of the southern sky, asking, “How dare the Confucian Temple allow you to stand here? Surely those sages must know the consequences. Is it that old scholar who guaranteed you? Ah, yes, he just achieved great merit and has been busy for nothing. For the sake of his closed-door disciple, he truly is generous with his merits.”

On the city wall, one stood and the other sat, their statuses distinct.

She furrowed her brow and slowly spoke, “Chen Qingdu, after ten thousand years of cultivation, you’ve certainly grown bolder.”

Chen Qingdu replied with a smile, “It’s been a long time since I conversed with a senior. Such opportunities are rare; a few scoldings are nothing.”

She stood quietly for a moment and realized some secrets that perhaps even the Three Teachings’ sages and many sword immortals could not uncover. Shaking her head, she said, “How pitiful. Had I known this would be the case, why bother from the start? Do you feel regret?”

Chen Qingdu nodded, “If we only speak of Chen Qingdu, there is indeed much to regret. Back then, people like Chen Qingdu already had paths they could take, unrestrained by the world, and could even surpass most deities. Yet, I still wielded my sword to rise high, striving alongside so many like-minded individuals, questioning the heavens. Those who perished never regretted it. So whether Chen Qingdu feels regret or not is of little importance.”

Chen Qingdu raised his head, “Senior, do you have regrets?”

The tall woman, her palm resting on the sword hilt, fell silent for a moment, then answered evasively, “Can you not see the locations of the three strands of sword qi?”

Chen Qingdu responded, “I’ve noticed some clues, but I dare not believe them. At the same time, I worry it may be a far-reaching scheme of the Confucians.”

He looked up at the sky and sighed, “Before that child came, the companions you had were indeed lofty and unmatched. Here a sword strike, there another, casually creating mountains of divine corpses and broken celestial abodes. Then a mere ordinary boy arrived, with the qualifications of a terrestrial immortal, yet severed the Bridge of Eternal Life. Was he at the third realm or the fourth realm back then? How could you expect me to believe this? I still cannot understand why you chose Chen Ping’an. So I deliberately turned a blind eye, waiting for this day. I hope that the moment I gain enlightenment in this life, it is in the presence of a senior, and at the time of my death, my last sight can be revisited.”

With a smile, Chen Qingdu extended his fingers and made a sweeping motion. Suddenly, a bright sword qi river lit up far away—not a straight line, but a winding river, like a celestial river looking down upon the mortal realm.

Chen Qingdu smiled, “The swordsmanship I learned earliest was just like this. To be honest, sword cultivators today have muddled sword hearts and unclear Dao hearts; they truly cannot compare to the qualifications of our generation. Just a glance, and one can understand the great Dao.”

This sword strike, landing in the wilderness near the Sword Qi Great Wall, was bound to cause quite a stir.

For example, speculations arose whether Chen Qingdu was about to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall for the first time in ten thousand years to question the sword across the entire wilderness.

She asked, “Are you showing off such trivial skills to me?”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “How could I dare?”

Then, the old Grand Sword Immortal, who had been regarded as the top sword immortal by all, finally displayed a bit of the spirit Chen Qingdu should have, “Moreover, my swordsmanship today is not low. If I had faced seniors like you ten thousand years ago, I would certainly have no chance of winning. But now, if given the opportunity to traverse the river of time with a sword and return to the battlefield of the past…”

She made no movement; the long sword tilted and hovered in the air, its tip pointed at Chen Qingdu, who remained unmoved, even with the sword tip only three inches from his head. A tiny speck of light formed where the sword tip pointed.

She said, “In this Sword Qi Great Wall, others may have no way to deal with you, but I am the exception.”

Swordsmanship in the world was initially divided into four streams: the Sword Qi Great Wall's Chen Qingdu, the Tianshi of Longhu Mountain, the Daoist sword immortals of the Daxuandu Temple, and another stream from the Lotus Buddha Kingdom.

This was the immensely concealed ten-thousand-year inheritance of swordsmanship, long forgotten by the world. Even many sword immortals from Beiju Luzhou were unaware of its deep roots, only knowing that there were four celestial swords across the world.

These four schools of swordsmanship each had their strengths, but if we speak solely of lethality, the Sword Qi Great Wall’s Chen Qingdu undoubtedly ranks first.

Chen Qingdu was certainly not afraid of the tall woman beside him, who had not yet reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship.

It was respect.

A respect greater than heaven and earth.

But to say there was no concern would be untrue. Just as she said, setting aside martial prowess and cultivation level, no matter how high Chen Qingdu’s swordsmanship, it would never be the highest before her.

This statement was far more shocking than when they reunited after ten thousand years and she told him to get lost.

For unless a sage of the Three Teachings held an item of faith and personally arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Qingdu's presence there made him truly invincible in the world. Even if Dao Lao Er held a celestial sword, there was still no chance of victory.

Why does the Hanging Mountain exist? Why is there a Capture and Release Pavilion on the Hanging Mountain? Why did Dao Lao Er, who clearly was already at the Hanging Mountain many years ago, not take another step forward? This disciple of the Daoist ancestor, who loved to compete with heaven and earth, why did he come to the Haoran world without drawing his sword and then return to the Qingming world? One must know that this Daoist’s initial plan was to stand on the greatest mountain in the world, face Chen Qingdu at the Sword Qi Great Wall, and engage in a fierce battle to the death!

To prove that he was not only deeply skilled in Dao but that half of Baiyu Capital was also his work, and he wished to demonstrate that he had opened a new lineage of swordsmanship in the world!

Yet, in the end, the only time Dao Lao Er visited the Haoran world, he still did not draw his sword.

Both were gazing into the distance, and throughout the encounter, she never once looked at Chen Qingdu.

On the southern wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the large characters inscribed there began to shed dust, and some earth immortal sword cultivators meditating nearby swayed without noticing.

Chen Qingdu smiled, “Senior, is this enough?”

She replied, “Do you know that your inaction back then greatly slowed my master’s cultivation speed? Originally, with the Sword Qi’s eighteenth stop, my master should have already broken through.”

Chen Qingdu said, “Young people should take their time, endure some hardships. What harm is there in that? If one ascends too quickly and too early, having seniors by their side is not a good thing for the several worlds. Speaking of Wei Jin and that sword business, it truly was apt. Someone should tell that little junior brother. If Chen Ping’an cannot become the true master of the senior, I think it would be better for this child’s cultivation path to be slower and slower, not able to draw his sword. After all, the later he reaches the peak, the better. If Chen Ping’an ever desires to draw his sword freely, I will regret letting him go to the Lotus Flower Paradise for training, seizing the opportunity to rebuild the Bridge of Eternal Life. If I recall correctly, that paradise’s cave heaven was a place where you once subdued a true spirit deity, and the sword qi caused the destruction of that small world, right?”

She fell silent.

At the sword tip, the tiny speck of light suddenly expanded to the size of a fist. Chen Qingdu’s hair began to flutter, some strands being cut and scattering with the wind, effortlessly severing the stasis of the time river.

“Chen Qingdu, I’m giving you a bit of face; make sure to handle it well!”

Her expression was cold, and her eyes contained a brilliance that outshone the sun and moon, “Ten thousand years ago, my previous master showed compassion for you, and you, these ants on the ground, received it. Ten thousand years later, I have already fallen too much. Your sword path has risen several levels, but that is not a reason for you to speak to me like this. The old scholar sent me here, filled with dread, and spoke a load of nonsense to me for a reason.”

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Don’t tell me the old scholar discussed marriage, and you’re taking it out on me? That old scholar is truly cunning, never willing to suffer a loss!”

Chen Qingdu extended his hand, grasping the light at the sword's tip, saying, “It can’t be more than this. Senior can take this pure sword intent. It is my apology for delaying your sharpening of the sword. If there’s more, I wouldn’t mind, but I fear Chen Ping’an will feel uneasy if he finds out.”

She frowned and sheathed her long sword. The light at the sword tip flickered and gradually flowed back down the blade, returning her to her previous stance, resting on the sword.

Chen Qingdu turned to look and asked with a smile, “Senior, what are your thoughts on the world now?”

She scoffed, “Too small.”

Chen Qingdu nodded, “Indeed. The once brilliant sun, moon, and stars dim under your sword light. Or rather, it is precisely beings like you that have given rise to the current dazzling starry rivers.”

The countless stars in the sky were nothing but floating corpses.

Chen Qingdu stood up, his form slightly hunched, as if burdened by the weight of ten thousand years, never having truly stood tall again.

Sword cultivators from several worlds, aside from a handful of great sword immortals in the mortal realm, had long forgotten that the world’s swordsmanship, tracing back to its origins, derived from the heavens.

After that, the myriad divine arts were birthed from the long swords of the human realm, cutting down the various deities one by one, which the ants on the earth, originally struggling to survive, picked up. Thus began the path of cultivation, ascending to become immortals on the mountains.

From mere puppets of incense sources, from livestock raised by numerous deities, they transformed into the rulers of the world. It was an incredibly long and arduous era.

Chen Qingdu was one of the earliest sword learners in the human realm, the oldest founding sword cultivator, who ultimately could join forces to open the heavens. The reason why true swords are swords, and why sword cultivators possess the greatest lethality, surpassing heaven and earth, is precisely this principle.

Yet, towards the end of that cataclysmic war, a schism arose within the human race, sword cultivators became prisoners, wandering to the Sword Qi Great Wall, and the demon race was driven to the barbaric lands. The Haoran world established the Central Plains Confucian Temple, constructing nine grand towers standing between heaven and earth, while the small Daoist riding a green ox departed for the Qingming world to lay down the foundation for Baiyu Capital, and the Buddha stood atop a lotus, his light illuminating the earth.

Compared to the extermination of the dragon species eight thousand years ago, what did that count for?

Chen Qingdu softly asked, “Senior, why did you choose that child?”

She replied, “Qi Jingchun once said that some people’s 'if only' equates to ten thousand, letting me give it a try.”

Chen Qingdu inquired, “Have you been disappointed again?”

With a flick of her wrist, she thrust her sword.

The sword pierced through Chen Qingdu’s head, the golden light streaming from the sword body, resembling a small galaxy hanging in the mortal realm.

Chen Qingdu remained utterly still, only sighing, “Your temper is still not very good, senior.”

She remarked, “It has improved a lot.”

Chen Qingdu sidestepped a few steps, avoiding the sword, and laughed, “Then did you really want to cleave the Hanging Mountain with a single sword back then?”

If it weren’t for the Semi-Saint personally intervening, and the rare appearance outside the Confucian Temple, the Hanging Mountain might have already collapsed.

She answered, “At that time, my master was unconscious; I could act on my own.”

Chen Qingdu said helplessly, “I never would have guessed that your master would be Chen Ping’an. But upon further reflection, it seems wrong to consider anyone else. Who could truly be the master if it were anyone else?”

Chen Qingdu suddenly laughed, “Qi Jingchun’s final move was truly a divine hand.”

With a casual grasp, she pulled the golden light from the sword, which reassembled into a brilliant sphere, held in her palm, casually crushing it, and sneered, “Bestow sword intent? You, Chen Qingdu?”

Chen Qingdu nodded with a smile but said nothing.

She brought her fingers together, smiling, “I’m taking it for myself.”

All over the Sword Qi Great Wall, particles of golden light began to appear out of thin air.

Chen Qingdu’s expression changed slightly; he sighed. He could indeed stop it, but the price would be too great. Moreover, he truly couldn’t gauge the other party’s current temperament, so he had no choice but to unleash his trump card.

Thus, the young man in a blue robe, who had shaken off the effects of alcohol on the way and was about to arrive at the Ning residence, stumbled onto the city wall, appearing beside the tall woman.

Chen Ping’an’s face was filled with confusion and surprise as he softly called out, “Sister Immortal?”

The tall woman waved her sleeve, scattering the golden light. The long sword in her hand vanished. She turned around, revealing a smile, and then hugged Chen Ping’an tightly.

Chen Ping’an felt a bit flustered, opening his arms. He turned to look at Chen Qingdu, his expression somewhat innocent, only to be pressed down by her hand, pulling him closer.

Chen Qingdu closed his eyes and then reopened them.

It truly wasn’t his imagination.

The old Grand Sword Immortal rubbed his temple; that previous sword strike had not been painless, had it?

Chen Ping’an’s face turned red, but fortunately, she had already released him. She slightly bent down, gazing at him, her eyes narrowing into a smile, gently saying, “Master has grown taller again.”

Seeing her about to reach out again, Chen Ping’an quickly stretched his hands to gently press down her arms, explaining with a bitter smile, “If Ning Yao sees me, I’ll be in big trouble.”

She feigned sorrow, covering her heart, “Aren’t you afraid I’ll be heartbroken first?”

In Chen Ping’an’s eyes sparkled a different light; his smile was radiant as he turned to the sky, raising his arms high, pointing at the three bright moons, and asked, “Sister Immortal, I’ve heard that in this world, it’s fine to lose two moons; the seasons will still cycle, and everything will change as usual. So, is there a chance that one day in the future, we can cut down one and bring it home? Perhaps we could secretly place it in our own Lotus Flower Paradise.”

She looked up and smiled, “Not now, but in the future, it won’t be difficult.”

Chen Qingdu stood to the side, nearly feeling awkward to the point of bursting.

She cast a sidelong glance at Chen Qingdu.

Chen Qingdu simply left.

But before departing, Chen Qingdu seemingly casually remarked, “Don’t worry, I won’t tell that girl Ning.”

Chen Ping’an turned around, his eyes clear as he smiled, “I’ll tell her myself.”

She stood beside Chen Ping’an, still smiling.

Yet within Chen Qingdu’s heart, thunder rumbled with three words, “Stay away.”

Chen Qingdu clasped her hands behind her back and slowly departed.

Chen Ping’an walked alongside the sword spirit, his hands tucked in his sleeves.

As for the river of time, Chen Ping’an was extremely familiar with it. Walking within it was not torturous; rather, he felt like a fish in water. That slight tremor of the soul wasn’t much. If it weren’t for maintaining a bit of face and if the sword spirit wasn’t beside him, Chen Ping’an could have sprinted away. After all, the benefits of being within the stasis of the river of time were nearly unattainable.

Chen Ping’an turned and smiled, asking, “What brings you here? Did my master visit Longquan County?”

She nodded.

The old scholar was still worried about his closed-door disciple being unstable at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Of course, the old scholar had expressed to her that Chen Qingdu, that old immortal, didn’t even give him face, let alone the face of Chen Ping’an’s master. Was this reasonable? Was it not a matter of disrespecting not just his disciple but also her master?

Chen Ping’an said, “I thought we wouldn’t meet until decades later.”

She smiled, “The matter of sharpening the sword at the Wind and Snow Temple’s Dragon-Slaying Cliff is already resolved. Master can rest assured; I explained the principles. Initially, the Wind and Snow Temple was terrified when they caught a glimpse of it. The guarding sword cultivators there didn’t dare to act rashly, and then a little boy with a baby face sneaked off to Dragon Ridge Mountain, performed all the necessary rituals, and I met him once, imparting a sword technique to the Wind and Snow Temple in exchange. They were quite happy since it could assist them in breaking through. Next was the area of Ruan Qiong, who agreed. That’s why the Dali Dynasty is specially selecting a new location for the Longquan Sword Sect now. Ruan Qiong is quite clever, not raising any demands; I was happy and taught him a sword forging technique. Otherwise, with his meager cultivation realm, any ambitions he had would be mere fantasies. As for the Dragon-Slaying Cliff at Zhenwu Mountain, forget it. It involves too much and could cause trouble. I don’t mind, but it would give my master a headache.”

There were some things she could do; it was just like how Chen Qingdu worried about who the true master was. If she acted, it would become Chen Ping’an’s trouble.

Some truths, Chen Qingdu spoke quite well, but she felt that Chen Qingdu had no right to speak so freely in her presence.

Chen Ping’an, with hands in his sleeves, said indifferently, “One day, in front of me, trouble will only be trouble.”

She was overjoyed.

Going around in circles, initially thinking they would be separated by countless miles, once this happened, there was no talk of disappointment. If anything, a tinge of regret lingered. Unexpectedly, in the end, it turned out to be precisely the sword bearer she had always wanted in her heart.

She asked with a smile, “If Master can scale the heights, what kind of person does he wish to become?”

“Reasonable in speech and principled in action,” Chen Ping’an said without hesitation. “And then, with a sword extending beyond the heavens and a fist striking down, all martial artists feel as if the heavens are above them.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 696: The Child in the Corner

She sighed, “Why must we live for others?”

The impact of martial arts training on Chen Ping’an, as influenced by Cui Cheng, was beyond imagination. That remark just now was clearly a half-promise from Chen Ping’an to the deceased Cui Cheng, resonating across the chasm of life and death.

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “It’s not like that. I’ve always lived for myself. However, as I walk this path, there are ties that bind me. I must keep some respected individuals alive in my heart for a long time. If the world forgets them, I will remember. And if given the chance, I’ll make sure others remember them too.”

She fell into contemplation, recalling some extremely distant memories.

After walking a distance, Chen Ping’an turned back to retrace his steps.

She followed suit, walking back alongside him. This was Chen Ping’an’s method of seeking certainty, ensuring the sword spirit would not stray too far in the currents of time, thereby avoiding unforeseen circumstances.

There were too many unexpected events in the world, and one could not prevent them. If they were to come, then so be it.

But at least on my side, Chen Ping’an, I would not let my negligence cause too many complications.

The one who understood me best was Mr. Qi, who died because of me.

They sat atop the city wall, just as they had years ago, both seated on the golden arch bridge.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Are you leaving?”

She replied, “I could stay, but the old scholar waiting at the Hanging Mountain might have to go to the Confucian Temple to plead for forgiveness.”

Chen Ping’an said, “A brief separation isn’t much, but please don’t leave without returning. I might be able to endure it, but it would ultimately be very painful—painful in a way I cannot articulate, just more pain.”

She laughed, “I and my master have shared life and death for countless years.”

Chen Ping’an turned around and extended his palm.

She raised her hand, not to lightly clap, but to grasp Chen Ping’an’s hand and gently shake it. “This is the second promise.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and nodded. “Whatever we say, we will do.”

She withdrew her hand, lightly patting her knees and gazing at the desolate wasteland in the distance, coldly chuckling. “It seems there are still a few old friends who refuse to die.”

Chen Ping’an remarked, “Then I will be extra cautious.”

She continued, “If I reveal myself, these sneaky ancient beings won’t dare to kill you. At most, they will sever your path on the Bridge of Eternity, forcing you and your master to walk an old road again.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “No matter how I might feel in the future or if I change my mind, I can only say that right now, I refuse to leave.”

She laughed, “Got it.”

Chen Ping’an suddenly asked, “Do you know what my greatest strength is?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “The courage to make choices.”

Take, for example, the year when he offered a sword to Mount Xiang Sui, the choice he made between her and Ning Yao was a decisive one. 

If he were wrong, there would be no subsequent events.

Someone who flatters so-called powerful individuals and authorities is not worthy to wield a sword on her behalf.

After ten thousand years of human history, how many people have soft knees and bent spines? Countless. These people should truly look at the predecessors of humanity from ten thousand years ago, who, amidst suffering, forged ahead, wielding their swords high, seeking only death to pave a path for future generations.

However, ultimately, this group of generous souls, after their deaths, began to show changes in their human light, which was vastly different from divinity. Perhaps it was being concealed—those puppets and ants created by the gods were called ants because of their innate inferiority. It was not simply due to the short lifespan of humanity. For this reason, they were initially viewed by the lofty gods as ants beneath their feet, only to continuously provide incense offerings, to be used and discarded at will, rendering their lives no different from weeds. Back then, the golden statues of gods overlooking the earth noticed the changes in the mortal realm. However, the matter of gathering and refining their golden forms through the incense of mortals was fundamental to the longevity of the gods, with unimaginable benefits—a boundless source from which to draw. Hence, some gods turned a blind eye, while others dismissed the notion, not realizing how much effort it would take to crush a group of ants.

But the final outcome evolved to this point, with each incident being a necessary coincidence. For instance, the conflict between water and fire.

The greatest exception, of course, was her previous master and a few other deities who were willing to regard a small group of people as true companions.

That was the genesis of martial arts and myriad laws in the mortal realm.

Chen Ping’an shook his head and softly said, “My heart is free.”

Then Chen Ping’an smiled. “I’ve never spoken such words to anyone before because I never even thought about it.”

She murmured those four words repeatedly. “My heart is free.”

Chen Ping’an was suddenly thrown back into the city by the Great Sword Immortal. Nalan Yexing had already appeared at the door, and the two entered Ning’s manor together. Nalan Yexing quietly asked, “Was it the Great Sword Immortal who pulled you away?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, not elaborating further.

Nalan Yexing wasn’t particularly worried; now that he knew it was the Great Sword Immortal, he felt more at ease.

However, Chen Ping’an communicated with his heart, “Grandpa Nalan, tell Bai Momo that there’s something to discuss in the Small World of Mustard Seed.”

Nalan Yexing’s expression turned serious. “Discussing matters with the young lady?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Together.”

The four of them gathered in the training ground.

Chen Ping’an briefly explained the situation regarding the sword spirit, only touching on the current circumstances without delving into deeper origins.

Nalan Yexing and Bai Lianshuang exchanged puzzled glances, as if they were hearing a heavenly book. 

A true spirit born from a celestial sword? 

Was it one of the legendary four celestial swords, the one that had the greatest killing power ten thousand years ago? Was it an acquaintance of the Great Sword Immortal Chen Qingdu?

Ning Yao remained calm, her expression unchanged.

Then, in the training ground’s mustard-seed world, ripples emerged as a tall woman in a snow-white dress stepped out, standing beside Chen Ping’an and surveying her surroundings, eventually looking toward Ning Yao.

Ning Yao raised an eyebrow.

The sword spirit smiled, “Don’t worry, I’ll be leaving soon.”

Ning Yao asked, “What if you don’t leave?”

The sword spirit gazed at the space between Ning Yao’s eyebrows, smiling, “Interesting. Worthy of my master.”

Chen Ping’an knew things might go awry, and as expected, Ning Yao coldly laughed, “If that’s the case, are you not worthy? Who decides whether one is worthy or not? Does it matter what you say?”

Nalan Yexing was sweating profusely.

Bai Lianshuang was even more tense, anxiety written all over her face.

The sword spirit chuckled, “That doesn’t count, does it? Let’s call it even.”

Ning Yao chuckled lightly.

Chen Ping’an, observing with a calm demeanor, found no need to intervene. At this moment, saying another word would only be a mistake.

The sword spirit yawned, “I’m leaving, I’m leaving.”

Her already ethereal form gradually began to dissipate. In the end, with Chen Qingdu’s escort, she broke through the Sword Qi Great Wall’s celestial curtain, heading toward the vast world. The old scholar helped to cover their tracks as they proceeded to Treasure Bottle Continent.

On the journey, the old scholar asked with a smile, “How was it?”

The sword spirit replied, “Not particularly beautiful, to be honest.”

The old scholar rubbed his hands awkwardly, “That’s not what I was referring to.”

The sword spirit responded with a casual “Oh,” “I was talking about Chen Qingdu. After not seeing each other for ten thousand years, we caught up pretty well.”

The old scholar frowned, sensing the timing was off and that he shouldn’t pry further.

The sword spirit glanced down at the Hanging Mountain and casually remarked, “Chen Qingdu agreed to let one more person through, for a total of three. You have some arrangements to make at the Confucian Temple.”

The old scholar exclaimed in frustration, “What? The great face of my senior only counts for one person? Is Chen Qingdu trying to rebel? This is utterly unacceptable!”

The sword spirit said, “I could just as easily make it so that Chen Qingdu lets no one through. If that were the case, would my face count for four people instead?”

The old scholar declared with righteous indignation, “How could we let our senior make another trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall? Three people is three people. Chen Qingdu is being unreasonable. As scholars, we are filled with righteous spirit, and we must uphold propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor.”

The sword spirit looked down again, noticing the Dragon’s Hollow. The old scholar glanced over and grumbled, “There are only some small fish and shrimp left. I think I’ll pass.”

Between the Hanging Mountain, the Dragon’s Hollow, and Treasure Bottle Continent, a white rainbow and green smoke flashed and disappeared, instantly traveling hundreds of miles away.

Not to mention the Sword Immortal riding the sword, even a cross-continental message sword wouldn’t possess such astonishing speed.

The sword spirit raised a hand, her fingers moving slightly.

The old scholar craned his neck to peek, feeling anxious, and tentatively asked, “What’s this for?”

The sword spirit replied nonchalantly, “Keeping score.”

The old scholar cautiously asked, “Keeping score? Whose score, Lu Chen? Or that foul-nosed Taoist from the Daoist Temple?”

The sword spirit smiled, “Counting how many times you called me senior.”

The old scholar lamented, “How could you do this? Just think, how old am I? How many old friends have called me ‘Old Scholar’ in just a single breath? I’ve never cared about that! Calling you senior is a title of respect. Old Scholar and that sour scholar are both nicknames. How many people sincerely call me ‘Wensheng?’ This anxiety, this sorrow—who can I tell?”

The sword spirit withdrew her hand, looking at the sea sect that simultaneously housed the Rain Master’s first deity and the Celestial Gate’s southern general, and asked, “How did Bai Ze choose?”

The old scholar smiled, “Made a good choice. Let’s wait and see.”

The sword spirit asked, “This merit?”

The old scholar shook his head, “Doesn’t count. How do you count it when the person is gone?”

The sword spirit scoffed, “Scholars are really good at keeping track of accounts.”

The old scholar nodded, “Indeed, it’s truly exhausting.”

The sword spirit turned her head, “No, wait.”

The old scholar, frustrated, said, “You can go to the Sword Qi Great Wall, but it’s too risky. I can guarantee with my life, but the Confucian Temple is notoriously stingy and refuses to agree! So I’ve allocated some of the merit that should belong to my closed-door disciple to this matter. In the lineage of the Second Sage, there are very few with heroic spirit; being miserly, merely being sages without heroism—what does that make them true sages? If my statue were still at the Confucian Temple accompanying the old man in a staring contest, I would have long lectured the Second Sage’s lineage properly. It’s my fault; back when I was flourishing, the three academies and all the study halls clamored for me to teach, but in the end, my own embarrassment held me back. I should have devoted myself to those academies. Otherwise, why would a kid like Xiao Ping’an, who doesn’t even have a senior’s status, be better than a pile of scholars?”

Regarding the old scholar’s unauthorized use of his master’s merits, the sword spirit showed no emotional reaction, as if such behavior suited her taste.

As for the old scholar talking about guaranteeing with his life, she felt embarrassed for this sour scholar. How could he say that, not knowing how he was neither human nor ghost nor god? Does he really not understand? Who in Haoran World could kill you now? The Absolute Sage would never intervene, and the Rites Sage feels similarly. The Second Sage only has a major ideological conflict with him, with no personal grievances involved.

The old scholar nodded to himself, “Use it early and it’s better; it’s best to use it up quickly to avoid my disciple knowing, which would only cause trouble. With this connection, it’s not a good thing at all. My lineage is truly not one to brag about; everyone is talented and scholarly, with solid character and true heroism. Xiao Ping’an has traveled through three continents and roamed the four corners, yet he hasn’t set foot in a single academy, revealing his attitude toward our Confucian Temple and academies. He’s been holding back anger; I think that’s good—this is how it should be.”

The sword spirit laughed, “Cui Cheng?”

The old scholar looked perplexed, “Did I take in this disciple? I only remember I have a grand-disciple named Cui Dongshan.”

The sword spirit said, “I think Cui Cheng has the most potential.”

“Who could argue with that?” 

The old scholar, somewhat lost in thought, murmured, “I was also in the wrong; it’s just a pity I have no opportunity to correct it. Life is like this; knowing your mistakes and being able to amend them is a huge blessing. Knowing your mistakes but unable to correct them is the greatest regret and pain.”

However, the old scholar quickly brushed away the gloom and laughed, pulling at his beard. The past cannot be chased, but the future can still be pursued. After all, I have taken in a closed-door disciple.

As for the previous generation.

We may be young, but we’re of the same generation.

In the twilight, at the tavern, the shopkeeper was puzzled. Why did Chen Ping’an leave for such a short time only to return for more drinks?

Business at the tavern was thriving; there were no empty tables, not even a spare seat. This lifted Chen Ping’an’s spirits as he bought drinks.

The shopkeeper handed him a jug of the cheapest wine and asked, “What’s this?”

Chen Ping’an sighed, “I ran into some trouble. Ning Yao told me not to be angry, assuring me she really isn’t angry. But I just feel it isn’t like that.”

The shopkeeper, not wanting to gloat, comforted him, “Ning Yao speaks plainly; if she says she’s not angry, she must truly be sincere. You’re overthinking it.”

Chen Ping’an retorted, somewhat sullenly, “Shopkeeper, who has better judgment, you or me?”

At this moment, the shopkeeper could finally gloat, “Then the second shopkeeper should drink a few more jugs. Our tavern has plenty of wine, and as per usual, familiar faces are exempt from credit, except for newcomers who have just broken through.”

Chen Ping’an squatted by the roadside with the wine jug, chopsticks, and dish in hand. Beside him was a frequent patron, a drinking swordsman named Han Rong, who couldn’t go a day without wine. He was from Dragon Gate Realm and, like Chen Ping’an, only drank a single snowflake coin’s worth of Bamboo Sea Cave wine each time. Earlier, Chen Ping’an had told the shopkeeper that such customers needed to be treated well with smiles. The shopkeeper had been somewhat dazed, and Chen Ping’an had patiently explained that drunk friends are all wine lovers, and they prefer to squat together and drink to their hearts’ content. Compared to those who drink alone every few days, the former are the ones who would return to the table before even walking a few steps away—such patrons are the best customers. All businesses under heaven are not easy trades.

The shopkeeper had taken these self-proclaimed wise words seriously, jotting them down in the account book, causing Chen Ping’an to feel distressed. How had this shopkeeper managed to run a tavern for over a decade? Had he only been a burden for a few years? Could it be that he had some talent for business?

Han Rong laughed and asked, “Second shopkeeper, drinking alone, huh? Did you get kicked out for being too annoying? No worries; I’m a veteran in the flower garden. Let me impart a secret to you; consider it payment for the drink. What do you think? A good deal?”

Chen Ping’an chewed on some pickled vegetables, took a sip of wine, and leisurely replied, “If I listened to you, I’d be in a mess. Moreover, I’m just here to enjoy a drink. By the way, who’s imparting secrets to whom? Do you have no idea what’s written on the tavern’s notice board? What did you write, Brother Han? Do you think this tavern is a place for you to declare your love? That lady won’t dare to come here for a drink anymore. You’ll pay double for today’s drinks.”

“Don’t be like that. Talking about money harms the friendship.”

Han Rong held up his bowl and took a slow sip, then sighed, “There are plenty of lonely men here, but rare are those like me, devoted. If I truly end up with a beautiful woman, I’ll consider it your tavern’s blessing. I’ll definitely come back to repay the favor, and then you can serve me two jugs for the price of one.”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “Sounds good, I’ll give you an extra jug then.”

Han Rong asked, “Really?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Just for a snowflake coin’s worth.”

Han Rong looked disappointed. “That’s not very generous. You’re the distinguished second shopkeeper, young and accomplished, a dragon among men…”

Chen Ping’an interrupted, “Stop, stop, Brother Han. If I throw up the wine, you’ll have to pay me back.”

The shopkeeper watched the two of them chatting amiably from a distance, feeling a sense of admiration. This second shopkeeper really knows how to talk.

Chen Ping’an had mentioned he genuinely enjoyed drinking here, as many tables in Haoran World had a subtle hierarchy. The more powerful one was, the deeper their cup.

Han Rong chuckled and suddenly remembered, “Second shopkeeper, you read a lot. Can you help me think of a few heart-wrenching poems? The standard doesn’t need to be too high, just something like ‘Once dreamed of the Green God pouring wine.’ I like that girl, and she particularly appreciates such lines. If you could lend me a hand, no matter if it’s useful or not, I’ll make sure to bring a big table of wine-drinkers over next time. If we don’t finish ten jars of wine, I’ll take your surname.”

“You think composing poetry is like drinking? Just throw money at it and it’ll come, doesn’t work that way.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “Besides, I’m not married yet, so I don’t take sons.”

Han Rong raised his wine bowl, “Let’s drink to our deep friendship first. At least help me come up with a line, even just a couplet will do. If not a son, can I be your grandson?”

Chen Ping’an lifted his wine bowl, “I’ll think about it later. But to be honest, whether or not the poetic inspiration comes depends on how well the wine flows.”

Han Rong immediately turned to yell at the shopkeeper, “Shopkeeper, I’ll pay for the second shopkeeper’s jug of wine!”

The shopkeeper nodded, secretly feeling that if Chen Ping’an was willing to focus on selling wine, in just a few years, he would probably be able to run the tavern to the city wall.

A tall young woman approached gracefully, standing in front of the second shopkeeper, who was currently explaining to Han about “Flying Lights.” She smiled, “May I trouble you, Young Master Chen, for just a moment?”

Chen Ping’an smiled and nodded, turning to Han Rong, saying, “It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand; she does.”

Chen Ping’an walked down the street with the young woman, smiling, “Miss Yu, you’re thoughtful.”

The newcomer was Yu Qia, the woman who haunted Fan Dache’s dreams, breaking his heart.

Yu Qia looked slightly uncomfortable, but soon spoke in a gentle tone, “I heard about what happened that night. Although I didn’t end up with Fan Dache, I still wanted to personally apologize to you, Young Master Chen, as the incident arose because of me, causing you some unwarranted distress. Perhaps this sounds inappropriate, and it might even make you think I’m just offering empty pleasantries. Regardless, I still hope you can understand Fan Dache. He is truly a good person, and I feel guilty toward him.”

“If Fan Dache weren’t a good person, I wouldn’t have endured that scolding from him,” Chen Ping’an responded. “Everyone has moments when they drink too much. When a man is drunk and mentions a woman’s name, it must be genuine affection. As for drunken insults, they shouldn’t be taken seriously.”

“Thank you, Young Master Chen,” Yu Qia said, bowing slightly. “Then I won’t disturb you while you drink with your friends.”

After Yu Qia left, Chen Ping’an returned to the tavern to continue drinking. Han Rong had already left but had not forgotten to settle the bill.

The shopkeeper leaned in and asked, “What was that about?”

Chen Ping’an smiled and replied, “It was about Fan Dache. Yu Qia came to apologize.”

The shopkeeper smirked, “Isn’t she just afraid of angering Chen Sanqiu? In the ranks of Fan Dache’s young lords, Chen Sanqiu holds the top seat. If Chen Sanqiu were to say something harsh, Yu Qia wouldn’t be able to survive there.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled softly but said nothing.

It’s not that simple.

Chen Ping’an suddenly said, “Let’s make a bet. Will Fan Dache show up?”

The shopkeeper nodded, “I bet he will.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, about to nod in agreement.

But the shopkeeper changed his mind, “Forget it.”

Chen Ping’an looked somewhat regretful, but the shopkeeper felt he was right not to bet, as less than half a stick of incense later, Fan Dache indeed arrived.

The shopkeeper rolled his eyes.

Fan Dache hesitated as he approached the tavern but eventually ordered a jug of wine and squatted down beside Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “Miss Yu said she feels guilty toward you.”

Fan Dache lowered his head, tears streaming down his face. He didn’t even drink, merely holding the wine bowl.

Chen Ping’an raised his bowl and gently clinked it against Fan Dache’s white bowl, saying, “Don’t get too worked up. It’s not worth it to think about fighting tomorrow, feeling like dying beyond the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Fan Dache downed the wine in one gulp. “How did you know?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I guessed.”

Fan Dache said, “Don’t let what happened between us ruin your friendship with Sanqiu, or maybe you’re still friends, but there will be some underlying tension.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “You’re overthinking it.”

Fan Dache nodded, “That’s good.”

Chen Ping’an said, “If you hadn’t come to find me today, I would’ve gone to find you.”

Fan Dache forced a smile, “I appreciate the concern, but it’s of no use.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “You’re definitely feeling down right now. The buzzing of flies is like thunder, and the ants crossing the road seem like mountains. I have a method; do you want to give it a try?”

Fan Dache asked, “What method?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Fight. It’ll hurt just as much as your heartache, and you’ll feel better afterward.”

Fan Dache looked doubtful, “You’re not just looking for an excuse to beat me up, are you? You’ll hold a grudge if I spill your wine bowl?”

Chen Ping’an said, “If you don’t believe me, fine.”

In the end, however, Fan Dache followed Chen Ping’an to the street corner, and before he could even get into a stance, Chen Ping’an punched him down. After a few falls, Fan Dache stood up, bloodied and swaying, walking down the road. Chen Ping’an finished the fight, still calm and collected, walking beside him, then turned and asked with a smile, “How do you feel?”

Fan Dache wiped his face and spread his hands, looking up to yell, “What a relief you are! I’ll probably go back looking like this, and they’ll all think I truly lost my mind.”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “What’s wrong with a man bleeding a bit? Otherwise, it’ll feel like you drank my Bamboo Sea Cave wine for nothing. Remember to settle the bill before leaving; as for that white bowl, let it go. I’m not the type to be particularly calculative; I won’t remember such trivial matters.”

Chen Ping’an paused, “I have something to attend to.”

Fan Dache walked alone toward the tavern.

Chen Ping’an turned around and smiled, “Didn’t scare you, did I?”

It was the young man, Zhang Jiazhen.

Zhang Jiazhen shook his head, saying, “I wanted to ask about the word ‘steady.’ According to Master Chen’s original intention, how should it be interpreted?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Steady has another interpretation; it can mean ‘not in a hurry,’ which has a similar meaning to slow. However, slow is not wrong, and in the end, we seek speed, which is why we hurry.”

Zhang Jiazhen contemplated for a moment, then smiled knowingly, looking up at Chen Ping’an, his hands tucked in his sleeves. “Master Chen, since I can’t practice martial arts or sword skills, may I take the opportunity to ask you for guidance on the meaning of characters whenever I have leisure time?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Of course. I’ll be coming here often in the future.”

Zhang Jiazhen blinked.

Chen Ping’an turned to see Ning Yao.

Zhang Jiazhen bid farewell and ran off.

Chen Ping’an quickly walked over, softly asking, “What brings you here?”

Ning Yao asked, “Have you been drinking again?”

Chen Ping’an was at a loss for words, the scent of alcohol enveloping him. If he dared to deny it, he might end up getting beaten half to death.

Suddenly, Ning Yao took his hand.

Neither of them spoke as they walked past the tavern and onto the street.

Ning Yao asked, “Why aren’t you talking?”

Chen Ping’an thought for a moment, mimicking someone’s way of speaking. “Chen Ping’an, even if you miraculously marry a wife in the future, she’ll probably be a bit dim-witted.”

Ning Yao, for the first time, fell silent, chuckling to herself after a moment. She squinted and raised a hand, leaving an inch of space between her thumb and index finger, as if murmuring to herself, “Is there even this much liking?”

Ning Yao grew somewhat puzzled, noticing that Chen Ping’an had stopped in his tracks. They remained holding hands, so she turned to look, wondering why Chen Ping’an’s lips trembled as he hoarsely said, “If one day I leave first, what will you do? What if we have children together, what will you do?”

He was no longer that boy from Mud Bottle Lane, nor the child carrying a basket of herbs. Just thinking of this made him somewhat sad, and then deeply sorrowful.

All the pain that could be articulated could eventually be slowly endured. Only the hidden sadness, kept in secret, would silently accumulate, year after year, like a solitary mute, curling up in the corner of the heart. That child would merely look up and silently meet the gaze of each of his grown selves, exchanging no words. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 697: The Unknowing Rain and the Departing Spring

A spring breeze summoned a gentle spring rain.

Under the eaves, Chen Pingan sat in a chair, flipping through a literary notebook, before standing up to stretch his hand out to catch the raindrops.

Before returning to Ningfu from the city walls, Chen Qing had asked a question: should he leave behind a life lamp? If he were to die in the next great battle in the southern battlefield, although it would harm the foundation of the Great Dao, at least it would extend his life by half. This was the method of soul expansion, a painful process. Most ordinary cultivators couldn’t endure such suffering. The mountain and water deities of the Haoran world punished the ghosts and spirits within their jurisdictions by lighting water lamps and mountain lamps, using souls as wicks. This method was powerful in its longevity, with the transient pain far less than that of the soul expansion.

The second step involved lighting a lamp in one's ancestral hall. Once the first step was endured, the biggest drawback of the life lamp was its expense. The wick was crafted from celestial secrets, burning divine money daily. Thus, in the Haoran world, only wealthy sects could afford to light a life lamp for their most important disciples in the ancestral hall. The crafting of the life lamp was a threshold, and the subsequent consumption of divine money often became a significant expenditure for an ancestral hall. If the lamp were extinguished, it would harm the cultivator's original soul, and falling from grace was a common occurrence.

The third step was to use the life lamp to reshape one's soul and true body, and even that was not guaranteed to succeed. Even if successful, future achievements on the Great Dao would suffer significant discounts.

Thus, the crafting of a life lamp was truly a last resort, a helpless measure for those in the mountain sects to deal with every “what if.” However, it was still better than a cultivator dying and their soul scattering, leaving them to hope for rebirth, painstakingly searching far and wide, only to be brought back to their sect to continue their lineage. But such cultivators often had broken souls from their previous lives, and how many could change their fate? Whether one could attain enlightenment depended on luck. After enlightenment, how to reconcile past and present lives remained uncertain.

Chen Pingan snapped back to reality, folding away his thoughts. Turning his head, he spotted Yan Fatty and his crew, with the rare presence of Shiedzhang. On rainy days, the tavern by the wine shop had to close its doors, but the tables and chairs were left outside. Following Chen Pingan's instructions, every rainy or snowy day, the shop would not conduct business, but each table would have a jar of the cheapest Bamboo Sea Cave Wine set out, along with several cups. The wine was free for anyone to drink, but each person could only have one cup.

Ning Yao was still diligently cultivating at the Dragon Slaying Cliff. After returning from the street, Grandma Bai and Nalan Ye Xing had noticed that their young lady was different, becoming serious about her cultivation.

Yan Fatty was here to discuss Chen Pingan partnering with Shiedzhang to open a silk shop. Chen Sanqiu and Dong Huafu were just there for fun. All of them opened their umbrellas and stepped under the eaves, leaning their umbrellas against the wall. Chen Pingan held a book in one hand and carried a chair into the side room. Yan Fatty looked at the exceedingly clean room and felt heartbroken. “Why does my good brother, the dragon-riding son-in-law of the Ning family, live in such a shabby place?” Chen Sanqiu took out a tea set from somewhere, said to be from a certain great dynasty in Central Earth. He began brewing tea, wanting to invite Chen Pingan to drink, but would he dare? Did he still want to come to Ningfu as a guest in the future?

While brewing tea, Chen Sanqiu smiled and said, “Thanks for what you did regarding Fan Dache.”

Chen Pingan waved his hand. The literary notebook on the table, *Talks on Flower Trees and Paulownia*, was a valuable book Chen Sanqiu helped buy from the Mirage, along with many official history texts, likely costing quite a bit of divine money. Discussing money with someone like Chen Sanqiu, who ranked among the gentry, felt like slapping oneself in the face.

As for Dong Heitan, who also came from a prominent family, forget it. This guy’s ability to save money was even more remarkable than Chen Pingan’s; it was said that he had never taken out a single snowflake coin in his entire life. Chen Pingan was tempted to find someone to help him place bets on when Dong Huafu would spend money, then partner with Dong Huafu to secretly profit.

Seeing an opportunity, Chen Pingan brought up the idea to Dong Huafu.

Dong Huafu shook his head, saying, “I won’t spend money anyway; what’s the point in making money if my family doesn’t lack it?”

Chen Pingan was left speechless.

Was that really the case?

Shiedzhang was the happiest, but after a moment he heard Chen Pingan say, “You don’t need to spend money. I’ll discuss it with the person operating the bets. We can place bets on whether you’ll spend money within a ten-day period, a month, or whether you won’t spend any money in a month. As for how much you’ll spend, we can also bet on whether it’s one or several snowflake coins, or that small summer coin. Then, let him deliberately leak the news, saying that I, Chen Pingan, have placed a heavy bet on you spending money soon, but I’ll never reveal whether it’s within ten days or a month. In reality, I’m betting you won’t spend a single coin in a month. You see, you don’t spend money, can still drink, and can even make money.”

Shiedzhang thought the second shopkeeper seemed even more ruthless than A Liang when operating bets.

Chen Sanqiu felt like drinking.

Yan Fatty was eager, “Then I also want to make a quick buck, betting on Dong Heitan not spending money!”

Chen Pingan narrowed his eyes, “Of course, you’ll assist that heavily hired betting operator in stabilizing the betting market. When some crafty gamblers are indecisive, you, Yan Fatty, might just ‘accidentally’ send your servant to deliver money, not knowing you’ve exposed yourself, letting people spread the word that you, Young Master Yan, secretly threw down a large sum of divine money, betting on whether Dong Heitan will spend money within ten days, thereby solidifying my earlier bet on him spending money. Otherwise, this group of miserly old gamblers will most likely not take the bait. How much money did you, Young Master Yan, throw down previously? Didn't it just circle around in my pocket before returning to you? Later, you can settle accounts with me and Dong Heitan.”

Yan Fatty clapped his fist, “Brilliant!”

Shiedzhang and Chen Sanqiu exchanged glances.

Just as Shiedzhang was about to join in, he hesitated. “Just a few snowflake coins; even this morally questionable money, earning a little is enough. Earning too much would weigh on my conscience.”

Unexpectedly, Chen Sanqiu shook his head, “Don’t think about dragging me into this; my conscience hurts.”

Shiedzhang began to hesitate.

Chen Pingan looked disdainfully. “You can’t keep using the same trick repeatedly. If used too often, it’ll only raise suspicion.”

Chen Sanqiu clasped his fists and shook them, “Thank you very much.”

Dong Huafu decisively stated, “I want fifty percent; you two can split the remaining fifty.”

Chen Pingan said earnestly, “Heitan, I’ve heard that everyone in the city knows Ning Yao can take on a hundred Chen Pingans with one hand. I didn’t think much of it. You see, that Fan Dache, not only insulted me on my turf, but even smashed a bowl at me. Do I hold a grudge? Not at all! I’ve completely forgotten about it. Now we’re good friends, having resolved our differences with a smile.”

Dong Huafu remained unfazed, “I was saying you take fifty percent, and I’ll split with Yan Fatty.”

They then moved on to serious matters regarding the silk shop under Yan Fatty's name, where Chen Pingan and Shiedzhang planned to partner, each taking a ten percent stake.

Chen Pingan led them to the adjacent room, opening the door to reveal a table piled high with various seals, big and small, totaling more than a hundred. There was also a seal catalog he had compiled himself, titled “The Hundred Swords Immortal Seal Collection.” Chen Pingan smiled, “All the inscriptions are complete, each carrying auspicious meanings—perfect for gifts between women, men giving to women, and vice versa. In our shop, when purchasing silk, no stamps are given unless a deposit is made beforehand, starting from one small summer coin. The earlier you pay, the better the stamp you can choose. However, if additional characters need to be engraved, especially if they want my signature, it’ll cost extra. Besides my ten percent from the shop, I’ll take an additional cut. Women can get a slight discount when purchasing fabric if they’ve already deposited money with us. If a woman throws a small summer coin at Young Master Yan’s face, a heavier discount can be arranged.”

Yan Fatty picked up a stamp inscribed with “Most Longing Room,” hesitating, “Here, while there are some noble women who dabble in literature, their knowledge is generally quite ordinary. Will they even like these? Moreover, are these stamp materials too common?”

Chen Pingan replied, “If the materials for the stamps were too good, why would they be given away in a silk shop, a loss-making venture? It makes no sense. These are essentially just trinkets for enjoyment. Besides, there’s no one in the world who doesn’t like kind words and beautiful characters; it’s just that they haven’t had many opportunities to see them before.”

Chen Sanqiu flipped through the stamps, finally eyeing a small one inscribed with “Hearts are Connected, Thoughts Abound,” tossing a small summer coin to Yan Fatty, saying, “Consider it a small summer coin placed in your shop, so this stamp belongs to me.”

Yan Fatty knew Chen Sanqiu was more discerning about such things than he was but remained uncertain, saying, “Chen Pingan, regarding joining the partnership, that’s fine, you and Shiedzhang will each take ten percent. However, I worry these stamps will only be liked by Chen Sanqiu. There are too few people like him who enjoy reading and flipping through books. What if we can’t give them away or sell them? I don’t care; the shop’s business isn’t great anyway. But if you lose face, don’t blame me for the shop’s poor luck.”

Chen Pingan picked up a small booklet from elsewhere and handed it to Yan Fatty, smiling, “Take this and read it a few times; just copy it. After all, the shop’s business won’t suffer too much.”

Dong Huafu suddenly said, “I want that stamp.”

Chen Pingan glanced at the stamp he had carved, instantly recognizing the inscription: “Mountains and Rivers Resent Not Far, My Sword Hangs Above the Rainbow.”

Yan Fatty laughed, “Are you paying for it now? Then how will the betting work?”

Dong Huafu replied, “Originally, the split was four to one; now it’s three to two.”

Yan Fatty didn’t hesitate, “Deal!”

Shiedzhang was also browsing through the inscriptions.

There was one that read “Clear and Bright.”

Another said, “Young Dreams, Gentle Winds and Sweet Rains.”

“One Life, Bowing Low to the Sword Immortal.” “The North Behind, Beautiful Eyes Awaiting.”

“Deer Cry in Harmony, Warblers Fly, Reluctant to Part.” 

“The Sword Qi Here is the Longest in the World.”

“Daring Not to Wield My Sword on the City Walls, Fearing the Three Lunar Moons to Retreat.”

When Shiedzhang found the last stamp, Yan Fatty’s eyes suddenly turned red, trembling as he said to Chen Pingan, “If I want this stamp, how do we settle the bill?”

Shiedzhang and Dong Huafu were stunned.

Chen Sanqiu looked somewhat melancholic.

Yan Fatty’s father, after losing both arms, hadn’t gone to the city walls to look far and wide since that one time when he carried the injured Yan Fatty away from the city.

Chen Pingan gently took the stamp from Shiedzhang's hand and handed it to Yan Fatty, “In business, it’s important to be fair. This stamp I give you, it’s not a purchase, so we won’t talk about money.”

At that moment, Ning Yao arrived and just happened to encounter Yan Fatty and others leaving with umbrellas at the gate. After entering the courtyard with Chen Pingan, she asked, “What’s going on?”

Chen Pingan briefly explained, and Ning Yao went to the room where the stamps were stored, sitting by the side, picking up one stamp. “Have you been busy with this for days? It’s not just for making money, right?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “It’s indeed not for making money.”

Ning Yao said, “Grandma Bai just mentioned that the fourth life item’s refining materials have almost all been collected in secret. Don’t worry; outside of the Ning family’s treasury, Grandpa Nalan personally oversees it, ensuring no one tampers with it.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I really should put in more effort. Being surrounded by so many Golden Dan seniors, I feel anxious, to the point where I can’t even speak loudly.”

Chen Pingan had broken through the bottleneck at the Liu Jin realm at Lion Peak in North Julu, and now he was at the fourth realm of the Bone Qi realm. Confucian cultivators at this level had a unique advantage, and their energy cultivation was the most outstanding. As for the fifth realm of Qi cultivators, “Life Between Heaven and Earth, the Body as a Furnace,” both Buddhism and Daoism had greater advantages. The distinction between the three teachings and the rest of the hundred schools was significant, largely due to the respective advantages of these two realms being an important reason. Although the five lower realms of cultivators were lower in level, they were praised as the Five Stages of Mountaineering, the foundation of the Great Dao.

Whether one could step into the middle five realms of the Cave Dwelling realm was as crucial as whether a pure martial artist could break through the third realm of life and death.

Ning Yao leaned over the table, examining each stamp, slowly saying, “When the door to the cave opens, it invites energy, and the human body becomes a small universe, where the sea of energy gathers like rivers. This is the Cave Dwelling realm. From this moment, cultivators can truly refine the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in an orderly manner. The human body has three hundred fifty-six acupoints, akin to three hundred sixty-five naturally occurring cave paradises, waiting for cultivators to climb the mountain and establish their path. For our Sword Qi Great Wall, whether it can give birth to an innate sword embryo is a dividing line between genius and ordinary people. Similarly, in the wilderness, whether the demon race can transform into human forms early to cultivate is also crucial. In this Cave Dwelling realm, male cultivators can open nine acupoints to reach the Ocean Viewing realm, while females need to open fifteen acupoints, which is why there are far more female cultivators in the Cave Dwelling realm than males. However, female cultivators in the Ocean Viewing realm often possess greater combat power than males.”

“You are unique; you already have three life acupoints and three other acupoints that have been immersed in sword qi for many years, plus the eighteen stops of sword qi encompassing two of them. That counts as five and a half. Once you refine the remaining two life items, completing the five elements, that will result in seven and a half cave dwellings. As long as you enter the Cave Dwelling realm, you might quickly break through to the Ocean Viewing realm. The Cave Dwelling realm is about opening the door wide to welcome guests. For ordinary cultivators, this realm can be quite torturous, as they often can’t endure the influx of spiritual energy, viewed as a flood disaster. If the soul and body are unstable, the journey of cultivation often sees them take three steps forward and two steps back, making progress difficult. You’re least afraid of this. The following Ocean Viewing realm won’t pose much of a barrier for you either; you are both a pure martial artist and at the Golden Body realm. Your true qi circulates rapidly. Cultivators should accumulate spiritual energy bit by bit to open and expand their paths, but for you, that’s not a problem. Only when you reach the Dragon Gate realm will you face some trouble.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “You’ve worked hard.”

These trivial matters were certainly things she had temporarily inquired about from Nalan Ye Xing.

Ning Yao flicked through a stamp, holding it in her palm, shaking it lightly, casually saying, “You should know these things better than I do, so let’s pretend I didn’t say anything.”

Chen Pingan placed his hands in his sleeves on the table, resting his chin on his arm, looking at those stamps.

Outside, the rain fell incessantly; it had rained quite a bit over the past month.

The continuous rain was unaware that spring was leaving.

Chen Pingan tilted his head, gazing out the window. Back in his hometown, his first disciple, Pei Qian, once sat with him on the mountain steps. As they watched the wind rustling through the pines and cypress, the shadows danced, and time slowed down, she secretly told her master that as long as she looked closely, all things in the world, whether flowing water or people moving, would appear to move very slowly, making her anxious for them.

Pei Qian would often lean with Nuan Shu and Mi Li on the railing of the second floor of the bamboo building, watching the rain or snow, observing the icicles hanging from the eaves, wielding a walking stick and smashing them to bits, then asking her friends how her swordsmanship was. If Mi Li was bullied badly, she would get angry and loudly declare she would no longer play with Pei Qian. One could guess that even Zheng Dafin at the foot of the mountain could hear her, then Nuan Shu would play the peacemaker, and Pei Qian would soon give Mi Li a way out, leading to laughter once again. However, when Chen Pingan was at the Desolate Mountain, Pei Qian would never dare to use a bed sheet as a cloak and run around with Mi Li.

After arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, if one looked carefully, there would still be lively and adorable moments.

For instance, sometimes when Chen Pingan went to the city walls to practice swordsmanship, he would deliberately maneuver his talisman boat to land a little further away, allowing him to see a row of children lying on the city walls, with their butts stuck up, pointing toward the southern wilderness and telling all sorts of stories, or busy arranging seats for the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, arguing fiercely among themselves about who was stronger among the old sword immortals Dong Sangeng, Chen Xi, and Qi Tingji. Just counting those three, the children could argue until they turned red in the face. If one were to add all the sword immortals in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it would be even more contentious.

It was said that Guo Zhujiu, at home, practiced her punches diligently, exhaling onto her palms, channeling spiritual energy, shouting, “Look at my Blazing Palm!” and going through a set of punches from the family gate to the back garden. Upon reaching the garden, she would stabilize her qi, performing the Golden Rooster Stands Alone, spinning eighteen times, exactly one circle without more or less, pitying the precious flowers cultivated with care by the Guo family sword immortals, as her untrained fists wreaked havoc. In the end, the entire Guo residence would be in disarray, worrying whether this girl had gone mad with her training. Perhaps even Guo Jian Sword Immortal regretted confining this daughter at home.

Now, when Chen Pingan went to the corner of the street by the tavern, Zhang Jiazheng occasionally came by. That little kid who first wanted to learn punches with a clay pot was the first to crowd next to the small stool, so he had heard many stories of gods and monsters compared to his peers. It was said that relying on those unheard-of stories, he had become quite familiar with a pretty girl from the next alley. Once, while playing house, he was finally no longer just a coolie or a horseman; he and that little girl finally played husband and wife. Later, when he sat next to Chen Pingan, munching on melon seeds, he was blissfully happy for a long time.

Inside, silence reigned, the quiet more profound than sound.

Afterward, Chen Pingan went to the city walls again, still unable to step within thirty paces of the sword qi, so the junior brother remained a junior brother, and the senior brother remained a senior brother.

After practicing swordsmanship, he asked the unfortunate fellow in the distance, who was busy applying ointments from various jars, if there were any messages for the teacher.

In the last two sword practice sessions, he had been relatively measured.

Chen Pingan said seriously, “How could that be possible!”

The unfortunate fellow asked, “How's business at the tavern?”

Chen Pingan replied, “Very good.”

The unfortunate fellow turned his head.

Chen Pingan immediately backtracked, “However, I still need to trouble my senior brother to add some finishing touches.”

Only then did the unfortunate fellow not throw caution to the wind and began to change the subject, “Have you read the *Tianwen Tian Dui* I mentioned before?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I’ve already read it.”

The unfortunate fellow said, “You come and answer one hundred seventy-three questions.”

Chen Pingan was somewhat caught off guard, and the unfortunate fellow calmly said, “You can start now. If you don’t know, just skip.”

Chen Pingan gritted his teeth and answered the questions one by one, managing to answer about half.

The unfortunate fellow said, “The answers aren’t what matters. Before our teacher became a sage, the most famous debate was merely about two matters: the first was ‘how to pursue knowledge,’ whether to focus on one thing at a time, accumulating gradually, or to first establish the grand principles without blindly immersing oneself in trivial matters. Looking back, does the outcome really matter? Even two sages could argue endlessly; if it were truly black and white, how could they have become sages? Back then, the teacher told us that in learning, both intricacy and simplicity can be beneficial. Young learners should ponder and seek intricacy, while elder learners should return to simplicity. As for whether one should first establish lofty aspirations, that’s not so important; establishing them early doesn’t guarantee permanence. Of course, having them is better than not having them at all; if not, there’s no need to worry, just accumulate knowledge along the way. Knowledge in this world is inherently the least valuable, like a street lined with noble families and countless flower beds, where someone plants but no one guards, with doors wide open, the garden blooming, allowing anyone to pick and carry back.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “The teacher is well-read, and my senior brother is highly knowledgeable.”

The unfortunate fellow couldn’t help but turn his head, asking, “You’ve never stayed by the teacher’s side; where did you learn these clichés?”

Chen Pingan felt somewhat wronged, “From books. Especially the teacher’s works; I’m already well-versed in them.”

The unfortunate fellow maintained a stern face, “Very good.”

In the martial arts arena’s miniature world, Chen Pingan practiced swordsmanship with Nalan Ye Xing.

While it was called learning swordsmanship, it was actually about tempering the body, a method Chen Pingan had devised. Initially, he wanted his senior brother to assist with sword strikes, but this senior brother insisted that it was a trivial matter that Nalan Ye Xing could handle. Even a sword immortal like Nalan Ye Xing felt hesitant, finally understanding why senior brother had been reluctant to strike.

Because according to Chen Pingan, even if the initial person was a sword immortal, Chen Pingan himself was also a martial artist at the Golden Body realm, still somewhat dangerous and prone to accidents.

One careless move, and Chen Pingan could end up bedridden for a month, which was far worse than having his bones reformed later.

Chen Pingan hoped Nalan Ye Xing would strike in sequence, from above downward, aligning with the method of the “Twenty-four Solar Terms,” to help temper the major acupoints along the spine, the great dragon of the human body.

Cervical vertebrae, Dazhu, Taodao, Shenzhu, Lingtai, Ziyang, Zhongzhu, Xuanzhu, Mingmen, Yaoyang...

These critical acupoints especially needed sword strikes to refine the path and barriers with sword qi and intention.

Additionally, it required the cooperation of a pure true qi fire dragon flowing through, meaning Chen Pingan couldn’t just stand still; that would be lethal practice. Furthermore, since the residual spiritual energy within each energy house varied, it tested Nalan Ye Xing’s precision in striking even more.

Ning Yao sat on the pavilion at the Dragon Slaying Cliff, and today, Dong Buding couldn’t come to visit with Dong Huafu. She said she wanted to ask Chen Pingan for a stamp, as the tavern run by Yan Fatty was too exploitative; it was better to buy directly from Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan and Nalan Ye Xing did not conceal anything during their sword practice from Dong Buding.

Last year, on the main street, Chen Pingan’s general background was known to the major families, including the Dong family.

Dong Buding, lazily slouched and leaning on the railing, asked, “Ning Yao, don’t you feel distressed watching him practice like this?”

Ning Yao said nothing.

During this sword practice, Nalan Ye Xing was exceptionally cautious, so the results were minimal.

Chen Pingan didn’t expect any immediate benefits. After practicing swordsmanship with Nalan Ye Xing, he walked alone to the Dragon Slaying Cliff.

Dong Buding mentioned that she and a few close friends all wanted a personal book seal, but they couldn’t think of the inscription, so they left it up to Chen Pingan to decide. Dong Buding also brought three pieces of beautiful jade that were sufficient for carving seals, proposing a deal: one seal for one small summer coin, and any extra material carved beyond the seal would be considered Chen Pingan’s labor fee.

Chen Pingan wasn’t foolish; was money really that easy to make? So he immediately looked at Ning Yao, who nodded. Only then did he agree to the arrangement. This scene made Dong Buding feel quite sour, exclaiming softly without saying more.

On this visit, Dong Buding also mentioned an interesting matter related to the Ning family: recently, a group of experienced cultivators from a great dynasty in Central Earth arrived at the Upside-down Mountain, led by a sword immortal who had previously slain demons here, with a Golden Dan Qi cultivator handling specific affairs, bringing along seven or eight young talents from various sects and mountain tops, intending to practice swordsmanship at the Sword Qi Great Wall for about three to five years. It was said that the youngest was only twelve years old, while the oldest was just over thirty.

Upon arriving at the Upside-down Mountain, they directly settled in one of the four private residences, the Plum Blossom Garden, which was renowned. They clearly had impressive backgrounds.

The younger generation at the Sword Qi Great Wall only had three major sects: Ning Yao, Dong Heitan, and their group, and now there was also Chen Pingan.

Then there were Qi Shou and his companions, as well as Pang Yuanji and Gao Yejun, who were more scattered and lacked cohesion compared to the previous two groups. Most of these young sword cultivators came from humble beginnings, but as long as someone summoned them, they were willing to gather. Regardless of numbers or combat power, they were not to be underestimated.

As long as young people from the Haoran world came here for training, they had to pass three trials, as was the old rule.

But who would be responsible for guarding these three trials? There were also some unspoken rules, like how the young talents from Central Earth were hosted by Qi Shou and his friends.

Ning Yao’s small mountain peak didn’t favor this approach; occasionally, Chen Sanqiu would show up to join in the fun, but in over ten years, he had only intervened twice. Ning Yao had never involved herself in these little skirmishes.

However, since Qi Shou and his group had given Chen Pingan a hard time, and even Pang Yuanji hadn’t escaped unscathed, someone from Ning Yao’s side would logically have to step in for the three trials. Typically, when outsiders arrived in groups for training at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the hosts would each send three people. Of course, for a matchup between both sides, whoever could take down three opponents would be considered lively.

Chen Pingan found it quite interesting to transform from someone who watched the excitement to someone who was now part of it, asking if the battlefield could be set on that main street to look after his tavern business.

Dong Buding smiled, “The location is usually quite casual, without any set rules; it generally depends on the last person guarding the gates. If you’re willing to intervene, it’s not an issue to have it on that street, even on the wine table at Shiedzhang’s tavern.”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “If I injure someone, the little bit of money I earn from the drinks won’t even cover my medical expenses. Our tavern is known for its low prices; we earn hard money here.”

Dong Buding smirked knowingly.

Dong Huafu said, “Fan Dache seems ready for the first match; Sanqiu will probably accompany him. The third person could be Gao Yejun or Sima Weiran; it’s hard to say for now.”

Chen Pingan asked, “What realm are those sword cultivator prodigies from the other side?”

As for Sima Weiran, Chen Pingan knew she was also a Golden Dan sword cultivator, but compared to Pang Yuanji and Gao Yejun, she was slightly inferior. However, she had been in seclusion for several years, and interestingly, she had two mentors. One was the patrolling sword immortal from the Hidden Official lineage, and the other was a more prominent figure responsible for guarding the prison, rumored to be a demon from the demon race. It was uncertain whether Sima Weiran, upon exiting seclusion, would surpass Gao Yejun.

Dong Huafu paused, “Is it necessary to know?”

Dong Buding agreed, “Probably not.”

Chen Pingan glanced at Ning Yao, whose attitude seemed similar, then helplessly said, “Forget I said anything.”

The group of sword cultivators from Central Earth passed through the gates of the Upside-down Mountain and settled at the residence of Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan within the city.

Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan’s family, much like the Yan family, had frequent business dealings with the Haoran world, so he had a wide circle of friends.

However, Sun Juyuan was likely feeling some headache, as these guests had already announced on their first day at the Sword Qi Great Wall that they would send three people to face three trials: the Ocean Viewing realm, the Dragon Gate realm, and the Golden Dan realm. Losing a single match would count as their defeat.

This day, while Chen Pingan drank at the tavern, Ning Yao continued her cultivation. As for Yan Fatty, Chen Sanqiu, and the rest, including Fan Dache, the second shopkeeper had a rare opportunity to sit at the wine table.

Business was thriving at the tavern, with over ten sword cultivators squatting by the roadside drinking, each cursing and swearing about those arrogant and shameless outsiders who were too brazen and stingy...

For some reason, while saying these things, the drunkards were spitting and filled with righteous indignation, yet all of them were looking at the second shopkeeper in a blue shirt with a white jade hairpin.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Boss, it seems it’s time to raise the price of our Bamboo Sea Cave Wine.”

Suddenly, the surroundings fell silent, then mourning filled the air.

Shiedzhang caught the second shopkeeper's eye and shook his head, “No price increase. What’s money to us!”

One of the drinkers shouted, “Just because the second shopkeeper said that, bring me another pot of wine!”

Soon, others began clamoring to buy wine.

Shiedzhang laughed, “You guys take it yourselves.”

Yan Fatty glanced at the first drinker who called for more wine, then at Chen Pingan, silently asking, “A setup?”

Chen Pingan smiled and nodded, “Can I not deal with these scoundrels? There are setups everywhere; it’s hard to guard against.”

Then Chen Pingan said to Fan Dache, “These foreign sword cultivators aren’t really overconfident; they’re calculating you. They initially gained a tremendous advantage and have secured a strong reputation. If they face three Golden Dan realm opponents, they will surely lose. Therefore, the key point lies in the first match at the Ocean Viewing realm; among those Central Earth sword cultivators, there must be an exceptionally talented prodigy who is not only most likely to win but might even win decisively. The odds for the second match are also considerable. Even if they lose, it wouldn’t be too embarrassing; after all, if they lose, there’s no third match to worry about. Aren’t you feeling frustrated? As for the third match, they never intended to win; even if they could win, they wouldn’t. Of course, they truly cannot win. Fan Dache, you’re at the Dragon Gate realm, so I advise you not to participate; but if you think you can handle the loss, then it’s up to you.”

Fan Dache decisively said, “I can’t afford to lose.”

Chen Pingan gave him a thumbs up, “Impressive. No wonder you’re Chen Sanqiu’s friend.”

Chen Sanqiu helplessly said, “What does that have to do with me?”

Then a few young people, including boys and girls, walked toward the tavern from the street. They were just there to buy wine, but one of the boys purchased a jar of Qing Shen Mountain wine for five snowflake coins. As he walked, he opened the clay seal, sniffing the wine, and with a smile, spoke in the elegant dialect of the Haoran world, “It seems that I’ve returned to the Haoran world and need to visit the Bamboo Sea Cave; I’ve heard someone is selling wine under the pretense of the mountain goddess, and they’ve even sold it to the Sword Qi Great Wall—quite impressive.”

Yan Fatty looked at Chen Pingan and asked, “Can you bear it?”

Chen Pingan nodded, smiling, “I can bear it.”

A tall, sturdy boy turned his head to look toward the tavern table, laughing, “The lineage of the Saint of Letters, how can it not bear it?”

In an instant.

This burly boy with a sword on his back was grabbed by a blue-clad figure, lifting him up by the head, while one hand remained behind his back. He tilted his head and laughed, asking, “What did you say? Speak louder.” 

(End of Chapter)

 # Chapter 698: How Will Ning Yao Draw Her Sword?

Five sword cultivators from the Central Continent (Zhongtu Shenzhou) had arrived. 

Aside from the youth carrying a jug of wine, who remained calm and composed, the other three took a step back, ready to unleash their flying swords at any moment. One of them, a young man in his early twenties, appeared somewhat dull-witted; whether retreating or drawing upon spiritual energy to prepare for a strike, he was always half a step slower than his companions. Then there was a girl, graceful and elegant, dressed in a brightly colored top with a sheer skirt adorned with floral patterns—the style favored by female cultivators from the Central Continent. She was the first to reach for the sword at her waist.

As for the final individual, he was, of course, the sword-bearing youth, Jiang Guancheng, who had been lifted off the ground by Chen Ping’an. After being restrained by Chen Ping’an’s powerful aura, he found it difficult to exert any of his spiritual energy from several key acupoints. He attempted to break free and flee, but time and again, he was repelled, unable to move. With the back-and-forth, his face flushed red, then turned purple, much like a dead fish hanging on a wall in the sun—his embarrassment was no less than his murderous intent at that moment.

Chen Ping’an asked, “He doesn’t want to speak; will you do it for him?”

The wine-carrying youth flashed a brilliant smile. “What he said just now, I didn’t catch it clearly.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Is it true that the disciples of the Sage of Literature have such poor hearing?”

The girl retorted angrily, “Chen Ping’an! Release Jiang Guancheng! Don’t think that just because you have some fame over here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, you can act recklessly! Are you going to kill someone over a mere disagreement?! The disciples of the Sage of Literature truly have tempers as fierce as each other! First, there was Cui Chan who betrayed his master, then there’s you lot destroying how many innate sword embryos from the Central Continent! My master’s uncle… and you, Chen Ping’an! As a disciple of Confucianism, a top student of the Sage of Literature, how can you stoop to such lowly work, personally selling wine? What an affront to civility!”

When she mentioned her master’s uncle, the girl gritted her teeth, her eyes glistening with tears. But as soon as she brought up Chen Ping’an again, she returned to her usual state, especially furious and exasperated.

Chen Ping’an pretended not to hear.

Such direct criticism and insults didn’t bother him much. After all, it wasn’t like she was cursing his teacher; she was merely venting about his fellow students, his seniors. He was the youngest disciple of the Sage of Literature; did he really need to defend his seniors?

Should he speak up for the National Master Cui Chan? Or stand up for his senior, Zuo, who was wronged? Did he need to? Chen Ping’an thought not. One sought to unify a continent as if it were a country, to stop the demon clans from advancing north and preventing them from swallowing the territories of Tongye, Baoping, and the Northern Ju Lu Continent in one fell swoop. Another sought to become the pinnacle of swordsmanship outside of the righteous realm. They were all rather busy. As for Chen Ping’an himself, he was busy too.

Training martial arts, practicing swordplay, refining Qi, and studying books, he was about to refine his fourth personal item. Coupled with earning money, managing the tavern, and carving seals, could he not be busy?

However, what mattered most was that this little girl’s words, whether reasonable or not, whether her reasoning was grand enough, ultimately didn’t come from a place of malice.

Thus, Chen Ping’an could understand and accept that.

“Zhu Mei, how can you speak to Mr. Chen like that?” 

The youth chastised the girl before continuing to smile at Chen Ping’an. “Mr. Chen has a high seniority, and as juniors, we listen to your teachings. Whatever you say, we will correct ourselves if there’s something wrong and strive to do better. Also, this Jiang Guancheng in Mr. Chen’s hand is a direct disciple of the Sword Immortal of Bitter Summer, who is one of the ten disciples of a certain master back in our hometown. It’s a bit troublesome. However, Mr. Chen’s senior, the Grand Sword Immortal Zuo, I have admired for a long time. Now that the Grand Sword Immortal Zuo is training at the Sword Qi Great Wall, I believe we don’t need to be overly concerned. However, we sword immortals across the world are one family; it’s ultimately not beautiful to hurt the harmony.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Are you a sword cultivator from the Ocean Viewing Realm? The candidate for the first match?”

The youth did not answer that question. Instead, he smiled and asked, “Mr. Chen, you’re from the Baoping Continent? Don’t tell me you’re going to help the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall defend the barriers?”

The youth and Chen Ping’an spoke in different dialects, one using the elegant language of the righteous realm and the other using the local dialect of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The youth glanced down. 

Chen Ping’an gave him a gentle push, sending the tall youth flying back over ten feet. “Being this tall, and I had to tiptoe for so long.”

Then Chen Ping’an looked at the amusing youth carrying the jug of wine. “At such a young age, you’ve already reached this level of cultivation. Wandering around here and chatting about random things, aren’t you afraid of scaring us timid, low-level folks?”

Chen Sanqiu explained their conversation to the surrounding patrons using his hometown dialect.

A chorus of whistles erupted from the tavern, especially from the drunks and bachelors squatting and drinking, who were very cooperative with the second shopkeeper. They used to think the second shopkeeper was stingy, but compared to these young folks from the Central Continent, he was now seen as a fine gentleman. They had wronged the second shopkeeper in the past; now that they were here drinking, should they take fewer dishes and side dishes? Moreover, relying on eating from the second shopkeeper’s side, they felt it was inappropriate to take advantage of him. Eating too much would lead to drinking too much.

Chen Ping’an turned to the tavern and jokingly asked, “How about I act as a four-realm cultivator and guard the first barrier? If you all bet on my loss, I’ll take this gamble.”

The patrons all raised their middle fingers, laughing and cursing, being quite rude. Some even cheered for the foreign sword cultivators, saying that the second shopkeeper, aside from selling wine and writing couplets, had no real skills. If it came to a fight, he could easily take them down with just a few punches. What was there to fear? As a foreign sword cultivator from the Central Continent, they should show a bit of heroism. That Chen Ping’an came from a small place like the Baoping Continent; with Ren Yip, Pu Yu, and Qi Shou, these four people could team up against him, deliberately losing to this bastard, as long as you’re not a fool, you better not believe it.

The girl named Zhu Mei coldly laughed. “So, not only are you a drunkard selling wine, but you’re also a gambler. The Sage of Literature must have been blind to find you as such a door disciple!”

Chen Ping’an smiled and replied, “Drinking, gambling, and slaying demons are indeed not worth mentioning; they are things that your Central Continent cultivators look down upon.”

As soon as this was said, the patrons around Chen Sanqiu erupted into cheers, banging on tables and clinking chopsticks. 

Zhu Mei was left speechless.

Deep down, she felt a bit of fear, as if she had inexplicably found herself in a strange little world.

Because although Chen Ping’an was some distance away from the various sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it felt as if this seemingly unremarkable disciple of the Sage of Literature resonated with the sword cultivators behind him.

Chen Ping’an laughed and said, “Do you know where my statement loses its reason? It lies in the fact that drinking and gambling truly shouldn’t be the actions of someone learned in the righteous realm. Just because I deliberately dragged in the slaying of demons, you have no retort. Because you are still a somewhat conscientious sword cultivator from the Central Continent, sincerely believing that slaying demons is a great feat. Thus, you feel guilty and empty inside. You really don't have to worry; in this world, reason needs to have a sequence. One must speak of things as they are, big and small rights and wrongs cannot overlap or cancel each other out. For instance, if you first admit the correctness of slaying demons, which is right, right for ten thousand years, then come talk to me about how being a drunkard and a gambler is entirely wrong, let’s see if I agree. How about it? Our Sage of Literature lineage, is our temper truly not good? Are we still willing to discuss reason?”

The girl’s eyes widened, her mind a muddle. How could this young man in the green robe, this drunkard, speak such nonsense that seemed to carry a bit of reason?

But she couldn’t help but feel a surge of anger.

Finally, Chen Ping’an turned to the now expressionless youth carrying the wine jug and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t guard this first barrier as a four-realm Qi refiner. Why? It’s not because I don’t want to teach you how to behave, to speak properly, but because I respect you as sword cultivators from the Central Continent, willing to come to the Sword Qi Great Wall to take a look at this wild world with your own eyes. For foreign cultivators, passing through three barriers is a matter of duty. What’s between us is personal grievances; we can talk about that later.”

Chen Ping’an walked back toward the tavern.

A man who had been eating pickled vegetables at an alarming speed shouted, “Second shopkeeper, you’re getting bold! Treat us to a drink, let’s celebrate!”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “I ask you all, sword immortals, to have some dignity! Hurry up and rein in your sword aura. Especially you, Ye Chunzhen, every time you drink a jug of wine, you eat three plates of my pickled vegetables. Do you really think I don’t know? I’ve put up with you for a long time.”

That man pinched the remaining half plate of pickled vegetables and said, “Return this to you?”

Chen Ping’an was left speechless.

The man felt proud, thinking that he had no shame, and was afraid of no one, especially not the second shopkeeper. Besides, hadn’t he learned from this second shopkeeper himself?

Chen Ping’an coughed lightly, not sitting down, and clapped his hands, loudly announcing, “Our tavern is a small business. I originally planned that apart from pickled vegetables, for every jug of wine purchased, I would give a bowl of plain noodles for free. This was me trying to appear generous. But looking at it now, I’ll have to forget it; after all, plain noodles aren’t exactly gourmet food. They’re just noodles that are somewhat chewy, with a sprinkle of scallions. When mixed with a small plate of pickled vegetables, the flavor is just passable.”

Ye Chunzhen immediately sensed the gazes of the surrounding drunks sharpen like flying swords.

Because everyone knew that reasoning with the second shopkeeper was futile.

Ye Chunzhen gritted his teeth and said, “Second shopkeeper, bring me a jug of good wine, worth five Snowflake coins! I accidentally ate too many pickled vegetables today, it’s a bit salty, I need some good wine to balance it out.”

“Alright, Brother Ye, just wait a moment.” 

That fellow hurried off to the tavern to fetch the good wine, not forgetting to turn back with a smile and say, “In a couple of days, there will be plain noodles.”

The sword-bearing youth Jiang Guancheng was already being helped up, dispelling the aura of Chen Ping’an’s restraint, and his complexion improved significantly.

Zhu Mei softly asked, “Yan Lu, are you alright?”

The youth carrying the wine jug, named Yan Lu, gently shook his head, smiling, “What could possibly happen to me? If the opponent uses this opportunity to guard the barrier, then I’d be in trouble. I’d get scolded by Jun Bi.”

Zhu Mei lightly complained, “You really are letting Jiang Guancheng run wild here. Jun Bi has warned us not to go out easily after arriving at Sun Sword Immortal’s residence.”

The boy in the plain robe turned to glance at the tavern before quickly withdrawing his gaze.

He didn’t like that chaotic atmosphere, even detesting it.

As a cultivator, he had no desire for any lack of self-respect, nor any trace of the celestial aura of the mountains.

Yan Lu lifted the jug of Qing Shen Mountain wine in his hand, smiling, “I just wanted to find out if this celestial wine has any connection to Qing Shen Mountain. My ancestor participates in the Qing Shen Banquet at Zhu Hai Dongtian every year.”

Zhu Mei rolled her eyes. “You, Yan Lu, love to flaunt your genealogy and family history. You’re afraid others don’t know how wealthy your family is. Jiang Guancheng’s family and sect heritage is no less than yours, yet you’ve never heard him brag about who his master is, right? He’s just a bit slow-witted, so easily swayed, and when pushed a little, he gets all worked up. Does he really think this place is like our hometown in the Central Continent? This time we came to the Sword Qi Great Wall, my ancestor told me many things, warning me not to act aloof, just to be a mute and deaf person. Alas, I shouldn’t be saying this; after all, I spoke too much earlier. It was agreed that you wouldn’t say anything to Jun Bi, just that I didn’t talk from beginning to end. Jun Bi, ah, even though he’s only in the Ocean Viewing Realm, he can be terrifying when he’s angry. I’m still fine; my cultivation isn’t high. But look at you all, you’re still like me, keeping quiet in fear.”

Yan Lu’s expression grew somewhat unnatural.

If it weren’t for her having a family uncle who was now the master of a college in Liuxia Continent, and it was said that Zhu Mei had signed a strange pact with a prominent woman mountain lord of their dynasty since childhood, without those two connections, Yan Lu would have genuinely wanted to slap her and teach her a lesson to make her more aware, to speak a bit more humanely.

At the table, Die Zhang had just heard that the tavern was going to give out a bowl of plain noodles for free. After Chen Ping’an took his seat, he softly said, “If I have to make plain noodles and manage the business, I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle it alone.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “Le Kang’s little brat’s father is said to be quite good at cooking, and he’s a decent fellow. He hasn’t had a stable job in recent years. I’ll pass on a secret recipe for making plain noodles to him, and consider him a long-term worker we’ve hired for the tavern. Zhang Jiazhen can come help out at the tavern when he has time; that way, the shopkeeper can take a break. After all, these expenses, over a year or so, wouldn’t amount to more than the price of a jug of wine.”

Die Zhang nodded happily, not at all less pleased than making money.

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Pang had long gotten used to Chen Ping’an’s way of thinking and doing things.

However, Fan Dache found it a bit puzzling and jokingly asked, “Chen Ping’an, you really don’t mind the trouble? How did you manage to reach your current level of cultivation? Did it drop from the sky?”

Chen Ping’an called out, “Dache!”

Fan Dache became a bit nervous, “What’s up?”

Chen Ping’an guided him, “Look at how many Golden Dan seniors are drinking together, at such a small table, there’s Sanqiu, Yan Pang, Heitan, Die Zhang. Such great company, yet you’re only drinking the cheapest wine. Isn’t it inappropriate?”

Fan Dache was reluctant to be the scapegoat because there was also a four-realm Qi refiner at the table.

Chen Ping’an quietly said, “That wine-carrying youth, if I’m not mistaken, should be the one responsible for the second match, just like you, in the Longmen Realm. How old is he? If you lose, how embarrassing would that be?”

Fan Dache went and got a jug of good wine from Die Zhang, but couldn’t help but ask, “Are you sure there’s going to be a second match?”

Chen Ping’an thought for a moment, explaining, “If Green Duan isn’t confined at home by Guo Sword Immortal, it’s hard to say. But now, there will definitely be a second match. The reason is simple: sword cultivators from the Central Continent care deeply about their faces. Unless something unexpected happens, the person guarding over here in the Ocean Viewing Realm from our side will be the High Wild Marquis’s sister, Gao Youqing. Right? She’s only been on the city wall once and hasn’t gone to the southern battlefield yet. Gao Youqing’s talent is certainly good, but in terms of combat experience and flying sword power, the Golden Dan sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall can easily outstrip their peers from the righteous realm. However, below Golden Dan, that advantage isn’t as huge as you might think. Moreover, the Central Continent is brimming with talent; Jiang Guancheng is one of the ten disciples of the Central Continent, and his master is the same sword immortal, Bitter Summer, who is still among them. Thus, he is not a significant figure. Hence, it’s clear that Gao Youqing will lose. And that wine-carrying youth clearly isn’t the person in charge of that faction. After I acted earlier, I noticed that the rest of his companions were all extremely nervous and subconsciously wanted to help out. But not everyone looked towards that wine-carrying youth, which indicates that he hasn’t gained widespread respect. If he isn’t a leader, how could he dare to take all the young talents and gamble with the pride of the Central Continent sword cultivators? At Sun Sword Immortal’s residence, there must be someone else whom they recognize as their leader. I estimate it will be a young prodigy with low cultivation but outstanding combat power, someone who can make even those of a couple of levels higher willing to obey him. Therefore, the rules for these three barriers must undoubtedly have been set by that person. After all, the Sword Immortal of Bitter Summer once came to the Sword Qi Great Wall; he wouldn’t be this boring. That Golden Dan sword cultivator wouldn’t dare to be so reckless. To put it bluntly, this group of young masters and ladies can easily be overshadowed by a single Golden Dan cultivator. This will further support the perspective of that young sword cultivator’s remarkable mind, capable of commanding a sword immortal and a Golden Dan senior to follow his lead.”

Fan Dache was shocked. “Chen Ping’an, did you already know the background of these people? Or is there news coming from the Downturned Mountain?”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “Guess.”

Die Zhang rolled his eyes, wanting to remind Fan Dache not to guess; it would only tire him out.

Yan Pang asked, “Is there a lot of betting going on for this match?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “Betting on our own people losing, taking the heavenly money earned, isn’t that comforting?”

Fan Dache handed over a cup of wine. “Just on this line, I’d say I didn’t lose buying this jug of wine.”

Chen Sanqiu added, “After all, it’s borrowed money from me.”

Yan Pang exclaimed, “Fan Dache, that’s good! You’re like a kindred spirit with Dong Heitan!”

Dong Hua Fu shook his head. “Still somewhat lacking compared to me.”

Chen Sanqiu asked with a smile, “Why not just take them all out at once?”

Chen Ping’an helplessly replied, “That wine-carrying brat is too slippery; he won’t give me a chance.”

Dong Hua Fu said, “Just find any excuse; you’re good at that anyway.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and replied, “Dong Heitan, you should say less and drink more.”

Fan Dache raised his cup with a beaming smile. “Then let’s all take a drink together?”

Everyone around the table raised their cups, drinking heartily.

As Chen Ping’an was walking back to the Ning residence, he encountered a Confucian-clad man, Jun Zi Wang Zai.

Wang Zai spoke concisely, inquiring about the sword cultivator Huang Zhou and sharing some insights about the verification process on the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In short, concerning Huang Zhou’s death, the Hidden Official lineage responsible for such matters, the two sword immortals were unwilling to delve too deeply. However, whether Huang Zhou was a spy for the demon clan was still inconclusive, as there was no solid evidence. Thus, Chen Ping’an killing Huang Zhou could go unpunished. But the Hidden Official lineage, along with Wang Zai, would definitely not help prove his innocence. Any future rumors would need to be borne by Chen Ping’an himself. In the end, Wang Zai also mentioned some matters concerning Huang Zhou in the alleys; he would take care of the aftermath and look after the elderly and young, just a bit of effort and worry.

Chen Ping’an curiously asked, “Why so fair?”

Wang Zai conveyed through heart voice, “My master was an old friend of Master Mao and traveled together seeking knowledge. He has always regarded Master Mao’s inability to attend the Liji Academy to cultivate his studies as a great regret in his life.”

Chen Ping’an understood, clasping his hands in salute.

Wang Zai could only return the gesture. In fact, this gesture wasn’t particularly appropriate, but he figured his earlier thoughts wouldn’t escape the eyes of the Hidden Official and the two sword immortals, Zhu An and Luo Shan, so it didn’t matter.

Suddenly, Wang Zai smiled and said, “I hear that Mr. Chen personally compiled and bound a book of Hundred Sword Immortal Seals, among which one seal inscribed with ‘The sun shines bright by day, the moon illuminates by night.’ I have a classmate who has ‘Yue’ in his name; it would be perfect to gift it to him.”

Addressing the young man as Mr. Chen, Wang Zai didn’t appear the least bit awkward.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “I’ll let Yan Zhu greet you. If you don’t mind the makeup scent at the silk shop, feel free to help yourself. If you find it troublesome, I can have someone send it to your study; it’s just a little labor, not even a worry.”

Wang Zai nodded with a smile. “That would be great. If there’s a border fee and signature, even better.”

Chen Ping’an said, “A simple task.”

Wang Zai asked, “Do you know why I’m willing to do this? I could easily remain silent, having no guilt in my friendship with your master and Master Mao.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “I don’t know.”

Wang Zai sighed, “Not knowing is good; that’s great kindness.”

Wang Zai bid farewell, leaving with a touch of elegance.

Upon returning to the Ning residence, Chen Ping’an stood for a moment in the martial arts training ground, watching Ning Yao practice in the pavilion. Even from afar, it painted a beautiful scene that could soothe the heart and spirit.

After that, he returned to his own small room, continuing to carve seals. That extremely rough book of Hundred Sword Immortal Seals would surely need to be rebound again in the future; after all, the Hundred Sword Immortal Seals weren’t truly limited to just one hundred seals.

The more than a hundred seals previously laid on the table had already been taken by Yan Zhu to the tavern as the shop’s treasure. What was on the table now were mostly plain seals, with only a few carved seals.

For Chen Ping’an, carving seals was not only a way to calm his mind but also a method to review his learning.

Furthermore, figuring out how to convey his knowledge through a few words and a dozen characters, along with ordinary material seals, and make people willingly take them away, even go out of their way to buy them, was not a small matter. In fact, it was a significant one.

Throughout the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall, many sages and gentlemen from the Sage and Sub-Sage lineages had come and gone; some even died on the southern battlefield. Did those righteous scholars not wish for the Sword Qi Great Wall to echo with the sounds of learning? It was just that everyone had their own difficulties and constraints, preventing them from truly promoting Confucian teachings. Of course, Chen Ping’an didn’t think he had the capability to do so; he could only deal with the matters at hand.

With the carving knife in hand, Chen Ping’an slowly carved out a seal inscribed with the words, “Observe the Dao, observe the Dao, observe the Dao.”

Earlier, Dong Budan and several friends’ private book seals, Chen Ping’an initially hadn’t wanted to take the business. But after Ning Yao nodded, he agreed.

Some things couldn’t simply be ignored just because one was feeling good.

Of course, Dong Budan purposely mentioned this in front of Ning Yao, showcasing his cleverness.

The few elegant jade seals Chen Ping’an carved were done meticulously, putting in effort on both grace and literary appeal. Since this was a genuine transaction, it had to be fair to all. Earlier, while drinking with Dong Heitan at the tavern, he mentioned that his sister thought it was quite good; if there was an opportunity, she would help draw in business. However, Dong Budan wanted a cut. Chen Ping’an politely declined. Dong Hua Fu didn’t mind; he actually didn’t want his sister running to the Ning residence frequently. If she went too often, who knew what nonsense might spread, making things difficult for Chen Ping’an first. Ultimately, the one who would suffer the most would surely be Dong Hua Fu, as Chen Ping’an would take out his frustrations on him.

He wasn’t unaware of how Chen Ping’an dealt with Fan Dache; after giving him a good beating, Fan Dache was still rather happy. Fan Dache was a bit foolish, but Dong Hua Fu wasn’t.

The extra beautiful jade scraps, Dong Budan being the daughter of the Dong family, her friends were also not small-fry. It was agreed that they would give Chen Ping’an these as carving fees, and they truly gave him several small seals, about a dozen, but with dense inscriptions. One of them even had over a hundred words. The material for these seals wasn’t ordinary white jade but rather a celebrated type of frostfall jade among celestial treasures. Chen Ping’an had to use a flying sword as a carving knife, of course not as a gift from the silk shop but had to be bought with real gold and silver—each private seal costing a small fortune, no bargaining, take it or leave it.

Perhaps because it was thought that the wealthy women visiting the silk shop at the Sword Qi Great Wall wouldn’t understand its intricacies, this seal, which at first glance seemed to repeat “Observe the Dao” three times, would likely gather dust for a long time.

Chen Ping’an switched to a plain seal to carve, inscribing eight characters: “Flowers and moons unite, immortal lovers.”

Chen Ping’an shook the seal, blew on it lightly, weighed it in his palm, feeling quite satisfied. With this carving skill and meaning, if this seal didn’t attract attention, he’d change his surname from Chen.

The tavern’s business couldn’t rely solely on women spending money; there had to be men buying too. That was the true skill of the second shopkeeper of the silk shop. Thus, after some consideration, Chen Ping’an whistled lightly and leisurely carved another seal: “In the human realm, there are beautiful women; shyly, they walk beneath three lanterns in the sky.”

At the residence of Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan.

Zhu Mei and Jiang Guancheng stood with their heads bowed at the steps of a pavilion, while the others, including Yan Lu and the rest, didn’t dare to show any smiles.

Inside the pavilion sat a boy, Lin Junbi, who was meticulously arranging a chess game on his own. The chessboard and pieces were treasured items he carried with him, said to be relics originally collected by the White Emperor City, later passed down to Lin Junbi. Among the two chess jars were inscriptions: “In all places, spirits protect” and “In everything, the heavenly heart shelters.” The many black and white pieces on the board sparkled like sword lights, each exuding different hues of sword energy, with the chess game contending as sword energy crisscrossed across the board.

Every time Lin Junbi placed a piece, the intricate trails of those entangled sword energies dazzled the onlookers, leading their thoughts to divine realms.

Lin Junbi hadn’t actually scolded the two; he had only listened to the account of events and inquired about some details. However, Zhu Mei and Jiang Guancheng were naturally quite apprehensive.

It was hard to imagine that Lin Junbi was originally from a humble background, but his experiences over the past few years had been so spectacular that others easily overlooked the boy’s modest beginnings.

Lin Junbi glanced at the chess game, then at the notes spread out by his side, and turned to the crowd with a smile. “No need to be nervous; the game remains unchanged; everyone can continue your cultivation.”

Three days later, the three would pass through three barriers.

Then Lin Junbi called out to someone, “Bianjing, shall we have a match?”

The young man, who had previously gone to the tavern with Yan Lu, nodded and walked alone into the pavilion to take a seat.

Earlier, on the street, after Chen Ping’an took action, he appeared the most obtuse.

Now, quite the opposite, this youth named Bianjing, after moving a chess jar to his side, had a laid-back demeanor, resting his chin in one hand, helping Lin Junbi tidy up the pieces into the jars, and unlike Lin Junbi, who intentionally avoided the sword energies, Bianjing chose to forcefully break through and lift the pieces.

Lin Junbi was just about to speak when Bianjing complained, “You’ve said it twice already; do you think my memory is that bad? Pretend to lose to that Situ Weiran, otherwise, the Sword Qi Great Wall will lose face. We’ll inevitably face constant trouble afterward, which might disturb Yan Lu and Zhu Mei’s peaceful cultivation.”

Lin Junbi smiled and said, “That’s good.”

Bianjing replied, “You’ll win the first match without a doubt. But do you have confidence in Yan Lu for the second match?”

Lin Junbi said, “I’m somewhat confident, but not by much. If only Bianjing’s current realm was at Longmen, there’d be no worries at all. After you and I go through our matches, the opponent will lose their spirit and won’t come looking for trouble with us.”

Bianjing joked, “I’m lucky, breaking through quickly; is it a fault?”

On the opposite side, this Golden Dan Bianjing was the only sword cultivator who didn’t belong to their Shaoyuan Dynasty. He looked to be in his early twenties but was actually approaching thirty. However, even at thirty, possessing the Golden Dan bottleneck cultivation was still astonishing.

Lin Junbi’s master was the national teacher of the sixth major dynasty in the righteous realm, while Bianjing was an unnamed disciple of Lin Junbi’s master.

Lin Junbi didn’t know much about this supposedly unremarkable “Ocean Viewing Realm” sword cultivator’s true background, as his master wasn’t willing to elaborate. This time, as they hurried to the Downturned Mountain, even though the Sword Immortal of Bitter Summer had hinted at some clues, not even that Nascent Soul old cultivator knew Bianjing’s true realm. As for Yan Lu and the others, they were oblivious to the fact that a dragon was swaying beside them, merely enjoying the unfolding drama.

If Lin Junbi’s greatest personal interest during this experience was to find someone to play chess with while also witnessing the sword arts of the Left Grandeur Sword Immortal, then the half-brother Bianjing was here for the number one sword immortal talent from the Baoping Continent, Wei Jin.

However, in the plum garden at the Downturned Mountain, it seemed that Bianjing was quite lucky, forming a good rapport with a lady responsible for overseeing the garden there.

Back in his hometown, even as just an Ocean Viewing Realm sword cultivator, Bianjing still carried the title of an unnamed disciple of the national teacher, and he thrived as if swimming in water, constantly encountering good fortune. Sometimes Lin Junbi even found himself questioning if Bianjing was one of those legendary beings born with enlightenment.

Lin Junbi asked, “I heard that Chen Ping’an has a celestial weapon. He fought fiercely with Pang Yuanji but didn’t use it. If you fought him, what would the outcome be?”

Bianjing plucked a piece, placing it on the stone table outside the chessboard, fingers aligned, rubbing the extremely precious white piece casually, as if sulking with the piece, casually saying, “Cultivating the Dao is one thing, but competing for victory with others is meaningless.”

Lin Junbi smiled slightly and grabbed a handful of pieces. “Guess who goes first?”

Bianjing, not in a hurry to play chess, raised his head and asked, “Did you find out?”

Lin Junbi nodded. “When you came back, you were clearly injured, yet you smiled more than usual, your voice louder; I guessed.”

Bianjing sighed, “But the opponent is Cao Ci. Losing isn’t embarrassing, is it?”

Lin Junbi nodded. “Losing to Cao Ci isn’t embarrassing, but voluntarily seeking a beating, I think that’s not very wise.”

Bianjing fell silent.

Lin Junbi curiously asked, “How many punches?”

Bianjing tilted his chin, pointing to the piece he was holding down with his fingers.

Lin Junbi, puzzled, asked, “One punch?”

Bianjing laughed in irritation. “Do you look down on your senior brother? Two punches! One punch shattered my flying sword; the other made me dazed. But honestly, if I were to be a bit shameless, I could take a few more punches.”

Lin Junbi smiled and stopped talking.

Bianjing asked, “Since Yan Lu doesn’t have absolute certainty of victory, don’t you have any other plans?”

Lin Junbi replied, “I initially had a plan. If during the second match, the Sword Qi Great Wall sends Guo Zhujiu, I would break through on the spot. If the third match was Gao Yaohou or Situ Weiran, then I’d break through again. But after staying here, I changed my mind. There’s no need for that. This would only give others an opportunity. If Chen Ping’an is present, there might even be a fourth match. Ultimately, I’m not his senior brother, and I would definitely lose to Chen Ping’an, who has fought through four matches, making him even more likable.”

Bianjing joked, “You care so much about Chen Ping’an? Zhu Mei and the others going to the tavern to hit the wall was also your doing?”

Lin Junbi smiled and replied, “If I, Lin Junbi, have someone like Chen Ping’an on my mind, he should feel honored.”

Meanwhile, that Chen Ping’an, who was being thought of without knowing it, was currently in a secret chamber within the Ning residence, beginning to refine his fourth personal item.

The Water Seal, the Five-Color Earth from the Mountain Shrine, the Wooden Idol after that, then the Five Elements Gold, and finally the Five Elements Fire, for which he had yet to find a suitable personal item.

The Water Seal was refined at the southernmost tip of the Baoping Continent, on the clouds above Old Dragon City. 

The Five-Color Earth was refined near the entrance to the sea in the Northern Ju Lu Continent.

The Wooden Idol obtained from the mountaintop Taoist temple at the ruins of the celestial residence was refined on an island in the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven.

Now, the Five Elements Gold he was about to refine was a golden page made of gold material, to be precise, a Buddhist scripture.

Regarding this matter, Chen Ping’an had inquired with his senior brother Zuo if it was appropriate, and Zuo merely said, “A gentleman does not disregard tools; what’s inappropriate?”

The cauldron was still the colorful golden cauldron obtained from the hands of the old Nascent Soul cultivator Lu Yong from Tongye Continent, of very high rank. However, due to Jiang Shangzhen, it was half-priced, only charging Chen Ping’an fifty Gu Yu coins.

Lu Yong once said, “Gold does not decay, thus it is revered above all treasures.” Therefore, this alchemical cauldron was indeed most suitable for refining the Five Elements Gold.

In the secret chamber, numerous celestial materials and earthly treasures were already prepared.

Outside the secret chamber, Nalan Yexing sat cross-legged, responsible for guarding and maintaining the formation.

At the Zhan Long Cliff pavilion, Granny Bai chatted idly with Ning Yao.

The old woman smiled and said, “Don’t worry; good people have heavenly assistance. Our son-in-law is a person of virtue, and heaven will surely aid him. Besides, our son-in-law is profoundly learned; although he is a disciple of Confucianism, he travels far and wide, living among the common folk, truly a Bodhisattva. There’s no need to worry about this refinement, Miss.”

Ning Yao still felt a bit anxious but smiled and said, “Granny Bai, don’t say this around him; it might make him uncomfortable.”

The old woman deliberately said, “Is it about addressing him as son-in-law? The most he’d feel awkward saying it, but deep down, he must be quite at ease.”

Ning Yao was slightly lightened by the banter and smiled, “If the refinement is successful, in a couple of days, I’ll accompany him to watch the three barrier battles.”

The old woman said, “You used to have no interest in such matters at all.”

Ning Yao replied, “I still don’t have any interest now; I just want to accompany him to ease his mind.”

After a moment of silence, Ning Yao said, “Granny Bai might not see it, but only refining the Five Elements Gold will be the toughest for Chen Ping’an.”

The old woman asked, “Is it tough on his emotions, or is it the barrier that’s difficult?”

Ning Yao said, “Both.”

The old woman suddenly felt a bit anxious, more so than her own young lady.

Ning Yao smiled and said, “Granny Bai, it’s fine. Chen Ping’an can always solve his problems; he’s always done so. If he knew we were worried, he’d worry even more. Otherwise…”

Ning Yao glanced toward the training ground outside the pavilion. “Without any hardship, he wouldn’t be able to chew on it.”

The old woman nodded, “That’s good.”

Ning Yao took out a seal from her sleeve, handed it to the old woman, and softly said, “I stole this.”

The old woman was amused and helpless, receiving it and glancing at the inscription, lost in thought, carefully stowing it away in her sleeve, unable to hide her smile. “Your son-in-law’s handwriting is truly beautiful.”

Especially those inscriptions were quite soothing to the heart.

“Even with silken threads dyed with frost and snow, she remains a beauty.”

Ning Yao shook her head, “He’s said himself that his handwriting is rigid; aside from some decent regular script, the rest of his cursive and seal writing is just superficial. In the eyes of experts, it would be laughable. But to deal with these ordinary material seals, it’s more than sufficient.”

Outside the secret chamber, Nalan Yexing found it strange why an hour had passed, yet Chen Ping’an hadn’t lit the alchemical cauldron.

Inside the secret chamber, Chen Ping’an kept his eyes closed, lost in thought.

The splendid estate of the Yan family, which seemed eager to plaster the words “My Family is Rich” all over the walls, had Fatty Yan Zhu feeling anxious; he had received that seal early and was now in a hurry to return home, but he found it difficult to take it out, dragging his feet.

Today, in the corridor outside his father’s study, he hesitated, pacing back and forth.

His father’s study had no door, solely to allow the head of the Yan family to enter and exit conveniently.

In fact, it didn’t have to be this way; it was his father’s own decision to remove the door, saying that without arms, it was just that—using sword energy to open and close the door, what a joke?

Yan Ming had long noticed the commotion of his son in the corridor; such a hefty fellow, walking around was thunderous. Now, although Yan Ming’s cultivation wasn’t great, he was still a Nascent Soul cultivator, so how could he not know?

Yan Ming frowned and said, “If you’re not going in, then get lost quickly.”

Fatty Yan Zhu feared his father deeply and couldn’t do anything about it; he had been scared since he was little. Later, this father seemed to have completely given up on him, treating him, the sole heir of the Yan family, with no intention of scolding or beating him. Until the last time he returned home with Yan Zhu, this man finally showed a bit of kindness toward his son, occasionally inquiring about Yan Zhu’s cultivation progress. After that, the biggest thing he could do was pamper his only son, and he must have received some guidance, suddenly starting to be strict with Yan Zhu, whether it was in cultivation, business, or making friends.

Yan Zhu instinctively wanted to obey and leave but, after taking a few steps, gritted his teeth and walked toward the study, crossing the threshold.

Yan Ming was a stern-looking middle-aged man, with empty sleeves sitting in a chair, his desk piled high with books, and a small spirit creature flipping through pages.

Yan Ming frowned and asked, “What is it?”

Yan Zhu, trembling, took out the seal, gently placing it on the table. “Dad, this is for you. I’ll be leaving now.”

Yan Ming was taken aback, looking at the ordinary material seal. “Are you short on money? And so you sent this?”

Yan Zhu’s face turned red; he didn’t even dare to explain, lowering his head and quickening his pace to leave the study.

Once outside the corridor, Fatty Yan Zhu felt a great release.

In the study, that obedient little spirit creature bounced over to the seal, squatting down and proudly showing the seal’s base to its master.

Yan Ming stared at it for a long time, suddenly asking, “Do you think I’m too strict with Zhu’er?”

The little spirit creature nodded vigorously.

Yan Ming chuckled, turning to look out the window, where a tall city wall loomed in the distance.

He didn’t dare to wield a sword atop the city wall for fear of being rejected by the three moons.

“Your father has no such ability.”

The little spirit creature blinked; it had diligently served its master for so many years but had never seen him smile like this.

On the city wall above.

Gentleman Wang Zai had just delivered a newly published book of Hundred Sword Immortal Seals to the current sage of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Ye Lao Lian.

It was quite rough, unable to compare with the typical seal books of the righteous realm, let alone those carefully collected by families of scholarly lineage.

The sage flipped through the pages, smiling knowingly when he reached meaningful sections.

There were no picturesque landscapes, yet it represented the highest city in the human realm.

Where children frolicked, sword immortals drank heartily.

When this Confucian sage reached a particular page, he paused his movements, nodding lightly.

Wang Zai looked over and remarked, “Perhaps here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, for the time being, no one knows of this interest.”

The Confucian sage smiled and said, “That’s merely a possibility; there might be those with both leisure and wealth who will go flipping through books and buying them, checking the inscriptions’ origins.”

The Shaoyuan Dynasty of the Central Continent was full of sword cultivators, just like the Zhu Ying Dynasty of the Baoping Continent.

Hence, today’s three barrier battles had drawn a massive audience.

The location was chosen on Xuan Hu Street, adjacent to the prominent families of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The reason it wasn’t on Tai Xiang Street, where Chen Sanqiu and Dong Hua Fu’s families were located, was simply because they didn’t dare. Even if both sides had the guts to choose this location, probably no one would come to watch.

Fatty Yan Zhu stood on his tiptoes, looking around, puzzled. “Why hasn’t my brother Chen arrived yet?”

Dong Hua Fu was gnawing on a large cake; the young master of the Dong family always kept a tab on Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhu’s accounts.

Fan Dache glanced at a nearby household’s entrance, and Chen Sanqiu patted his shoulder, reassuring him. “It’s nothing.”

At both ends of the street, sword cultivators from the local area, led by Qi Shou and Gao Yaohou, stood alongside the foreign sword cultivators, Yan Lu and Jiang Guancheng, all surrounding the youth Lin Junbi like stars around the moon. Among them, Bianjing remained the most inconspicuous presence.

Gao Yaohou’s sister, Gao Youqing, would guard the first barrier. The last time she didn’t show up to watch, Gao Yaohou was naturally present today. Pang Yuanji stood beside Gao Yaohou, discussing some precautions with the short Gao Youqing. It wasn’t that Gao Yaohou didn’t want to; it was just that his sister had never enjoyed listening to his nagging.

Lin Junbi slowly stepped forward, while Gao Youqing strode ahead.

Neither side showed any intention of using their flying swords, gradually closing the distance.

A group of Earth Immortal sword cultivators squatting at the steps of a nearby residence laughed, “Gao girl, the opponent looks handsome enough to suit you! As long as you win, just toss him over your shoulder and run to a secluded place; wouldn’t you be able to do whatever you want?”

Gao Youqing ignored them, focusing intently on the approaching youth.

Lin Junbi, surprisingly at ease, looked around, surveying the magnificent estates lining Xuan Hu Street.

The two Ocean Viewing Realm sword cultivators clashed with just one sword, distinguishing their strengths.

Gao Youqing was the first to summon her personal flying sword, sending it slicing through the air in a flash, not seeking grandeur.

Lin Junbi’s flying sword was released after hers, effortlessly shattering Gao Youqing’s flying sword while simultaneously hovering at her brow.

Gao Youqing’s complexion turned pale.

The flying sword at her brow suddenly vanished as Lin Junbi had already turned away.

Yan Lu took a deep breath and stepped out of the crowd, brushing past Lin Junbi.

Lin Junbi smiled at him and said, “You could take your time deciding the victory.”

Yan Lu nodded heavily.

The sword cultivators gathered on both sides of the street, however, remained silent, as the competition between peers had swiftly determined the winner; that was merely the opponent’s skill.

Yet that young man was too much to handle.

He was almost catching up to that tavern’s second shopkeeper.

“Whoever wishes to come, let them come.”

That second shopkeeper, walking alongside Ning Yao, just happened to emerge from the street where Lin Junbi was located.

Lin Junbi glanced at the pale-faced, seemingly unwell man in a green robe. He smiled but didn’t linger on him. Instead, he looked at the woman beside him, said to be extraordinarily remarkable, with compliments too numerous to count. He had already heard plenty about her during his time at the plum garden in the Downturned Mountain. But how could a ten-year-old Ocean Viewing Realm cultivator be so outstanding? A twenty-something Golden Dan bottleneck sword cultivator had yet to become a Nascent Soul; how could they possibly be considered invincible?

Lin Junbi shook his head; he looked at her a few more times, not even thinking she was particularly beautiful. Compared to what he imagined of Ning Yao from the Sword Qi Great Wall, she was lacking significantly.

Chen Ping’an, with his hands tucked in his sleeves, walked leisurely, turning his head to glance at the youth. “Keep your eyes in check.”

Immediately, the entire street erupted in whistles, teasing their own people. The Sword Qi Great Wall had never held back in this regard.

Especially that second shopkeeper—unlike Gao Youqing, who was just a little girl, this fellow had quite a thick skin. Earning money was more morally ambiguous to him than fighting.

Lin Junbi smiled and remarked, “Are you talking about yourself?”

After Chen Ping’an finished speaking, he no longer looked at the youth, instead shifting his gaze to the hidden Bianjing in the crowd.

Bianjing appeared unaffected, but he felt somewhat dubious. Had he revealed himself back at the tavern?

Not likely.

Ning Yao tugged at Chen Ping’an’s sleeve, and he paused, softly asking, “What’s wrong?”

Ning Yao looked at him.

Chen Ping’an smiled and nodded.

So, Ning Yao turned to Lin Junbi and said, “If you want to keep your eyes in check, then you better do so.”

Lin Junbi’s lips twitched.

Then Ning Yao said a few words.

The entire street fell silent in an instant.

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhu exchanged glances, both reading the pity in each other’s eyes, and they struggled to hold back their laughter.

What’s more, even the sword immortals stationed atop the city walls directly flew over on their swords, not even using their divine powers to keep watch over the mountains and rivers.

Because Ning Yao had just said, “If you dare to break through temporarily and strike with the Longmen realm, I’ll suppress you at the Ocean Viewing realm. If you break through again and strike with the Golden Dan realm, I’ll suppress you at the Longmen realm. Do you want to concede now?” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 699: The Realm Holds No Meaning for Me

For cultivators, unexpected events are unwelcome.

Lin Junbi particularly disliked it when accidents occurred around him. Yan Lu, Zhu Mei, and Jiang Guancheng had gone to the tavern three days ago to buy wine, which was no accident but rather a deliberate act on his part.

Yan Lu’s ancestor was well-acquainted with the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven. Yan Lu himself had a personality that hid daggers behind a smile, often leaning toward the dark and gloomy, and he excelled at stirring trouble. Zhu Mei’s master had lost an innate sword embryo to the hands of a sword immortal early on. She was deeply influenced by the teachings of the sub-saint lineage, favored defending the weak, and spoke her mind freely. Jiang Guancheng had an impulsive nature; this time, while heading south to the Overturned Mountain, he had endured silently.

With these three in the tavern, they had nothing to fear from Chen Pingan, whether he chose to intervene or not; even if he chose to strike hard, it wouldn’t matter. They knew that even if Chen Pingan disappointed him, he was still impatient and liked to show off his cultivation, not much better than Jiang Guancheng, and ultimately, he had his senior brother Yan Lu to shield him. Moreover, if Chen Pingan acted too recklessly, he would make many enemies.

Thus, outside the pavilion in the residence of the native sword immortal Sun Juyuan, Zhu Mei and the others felt a sense of guilt. The proud Yan Lu was a bit anxious, while Lin Junbi showed no anger at all. He understood that he needed to treat the pieces on his chessboard well. This was the very teacher who imparted knowledge to him and also his master in the way of the Dao, the national master of the Shaoyuan Dynasty, who had taught Lin Junbi the very first lesson on his first day of chess: that people and chess pieces are fundamentally different. People have lives to live, paths to walk, and the seven emotions and six desires are all part of human nature. Viewing them merely as lifeless objects to be manipulated at will brings one close to death.

In fact, during his journey south, Lin Junbi had been openly honest with Yan Lu and the others. Setting aside this latest scheme, he had genuinely treated them with courtesy. Whether it was anyone seeking his advice on learning, swordsmanship, or chess, Lin Junbi had answered all inquiries without reservation.

On the road south, Lin Junbi had learned in detail about the proud sons of the Eight Continents beyond the Central Land, especially those with particularly distinct personalities, such as Lin Su from the North Julu Continent, Liu Youzhou from the Aihai Continent, and Ma Kuxuan from the Baoping Continent. Each had their merits, and observing their lives could help refine his own Dao heart.

However, at this moment, Lin Junbi felt somewhat unprepared, as if he were alone on the chessboard, unable to borrow from any other forces, only himself and his life-bound flying sword, caught in a perilous situation.

Earlier at Sun Juyuan’s residence, Lin Junbi had candidly told Yan Lu that he did not wish to confront Chen Pingan so soon, as there was indeed no chance of winning, especially since he was not yet fifteen years old.

If this was true for Chen Pingan, then it was even more so for Ning Yao. Lin Junbi's confidence stemmed from his future self a decade later, in comparison to the current Chen Pingan and Ning Yao. Or rather, it was Lin Junbi today compared to Chen Pingan and Ning Yao from ten years ago.

This also echoed the second piece of wisdom imparted by the national master: competing with others for victory and pride can lead to an unwillingness to accept defeat, which can be lethal.

Lin Junbi’s mind raced as he sought a comprehensive strategy to help him out of this predicament.

As for why Lin Junbi focused so much on Chen Pingan, it was, of course, due to the ripples caused by the earlier conflict. Confucian disciples place great importance on the relationships between heaven, earth, sovereign, parents, and teachers. On the path of cultivation, one often relies on those closest to them, who accompany them the longest, and have the deepest influence. Lin Junbi was no exception; once he committed himself to a particular school of thought, he would also inherit its past grievances. His teacher and an old scholar had a long-standing animosity, stemming from the early prohibition of the teachings of the Sage of Literature. The Shaoyuan Dynasty was among the first to fiercely suppress such teachings in the Central Land. However, when the national master privately spoke of the old scholar, there was little animosity despite the many grievances. If they were to discuss knowledge rather than character, the national master had a certain appreciation for him, which only added to Lin Junbi's internal discomfort.

After Ning Yao finished speaking, she fell silent.

To her, Lin Junbi's choice was simple: if he didn’t draw his sword, he admitted defeat. If he did, he would lose and suffer even more.

Thus, Ning Yao didn’t quite understand what there was to contemplate.

Ning Yao didn't like this young man, not only because he couldn't control his gaze and didn't speak well, but also because his thoughts were too heavy and not pure enough. A sword cultivator should practice the sword and advance without hesitation. Did he truly have no intention of respecting his own life-bound flying sword? If it could be understood that the various teachings of the Three Teachings and Hundred Schools had many criticisms regarding sword cultivators, it was reasonable to consider it as an irreconcilable difference. So why was it that even the sword cultivators themselves were reluctant to show a bit of sincerity? Therefore, should his opponent draw his sword and still lose, Ning Yao intended to say one thing: among the countless divine techniques in the world, flying swords were the most direct. If he didn't draw his sword and admitted defeat, then there would be no need to say even that much.

In fact, aside from Lin Junbi feeling the most awkward, Yan Lu, facing off with Liu Tiefu not far down the street, also felt quite awkward.

As for Liu Tiefu, the second line of defense at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he was, of course, not awkward at all. On the contrary, he was very happy. The reason was simple: he had declared himself the number one admirer of Ning Yao at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Growing up in the bustling streets, he had a thick skin. In the beginning, he tried everything to sneak into the Ning residence, for instance, becoming an anonymous disciple of Nalan Yexing like Cui Wei or attempting to get a job as a guard at the Ning residence. But every time he encountered Ning Yao on the street, Liu Tiefu would blush, lower his head, and run away. Just from a distance, a glance at Ning Yao was enough to satisfy him. Being near Ning Yao made his face pale and his palms sweat, easily annoying her.

Thus, Liu Tiefu loudly told Yan Lu, “Once things settle down over there, let’s have our match.”

As for whether Yan Lu understood his dialect, Liu Tiefu couldn’t be bothered. After all, he was already squatting on the ground, gazing at the young lady Ning from afar, waving his hand several times, perhaps wanting to request that the young man in the white robe with a jade hairpin by Ning Yao’s side step aside a bit, so he wouldn’t obstruct his admiration for her.

Regarding that outsider Chen Pingan, Liu Tiefu was still somewhat respectful. However, even if this person had consecutively defeated Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji, Liu Tiefu thought he still didn’t deserve Ning Yao. But since Ning Yao liked him, he could only endure it. There was no other choice; he couldn’t defeat him, so he sought an opportunity to visit the tavern, drank some wine, carved his name, and secretly wrote a line behind the blank board: “Ning Yao, you have someone you like, and I’m heartbroken.” The second time Liu Tiefu went to the tavern, he saw that Chen Pingan was standing at the tavern entrance, smiling and waving at him, saying, “Let’s have a chat.” Without a word, Liu Tiefu turned and ran, only daring to inquire through someone else whether his blank board had been thrown away. When he learned that it hadn’t, he felt that Chen Pingan wasn’t bad after all.

Ning Yao’s choice of partner, if he were petty and small-minded, would be quite unreasonable.

Sword immortals, one after another, descended from the city walls, landing atop the walls of various residences on either side of the street.

Moreover, there were sword immortals continuously flying in on swords between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the city.

Lin Junbi, maintaining his composure, cupped his fists toward Ning Yao and said, “In my youth and ignorance, I have offended you greatly. Lin Junbi admits defeat.”

Yan Lu let out a sigh of relief; not drawing his sword was indeed the right choice. If he had drawn his sword, he would have to worry about Lin Junbi, the future pillar of swordsmanship in the Shaoyuan Dynasty, collapsing in a foreign land. At that time, the national master wouldn’t spare Yan Lu either. Unlike Lin Junbi’s careful considerations, Yan Lu didn’t overthink things; he only chose one or two connections to see through. For instance, there was a saying at the Sword Qi Great Wall that Ning Yao was a type of sword cultivator, while the others were of a different kind. Furthermore, Ning Yao had participated in multiple battles outside the city and had traveled alone in the world of righteousness at a young age. Ning Yao was absolutely not one of those exceptionally gifted frogs at the bottom of a well. Thus, her statement implied that she held a winning hand; her words meant that she would draw her sword.

Therefore, there was no need for Yan Lu to delve into what kind of sword techniques Ning Yao possessed, nor her combat strength or realm.

There was no need.

Ning Yao said, “Then what is the point of you coming to the Sword Qi Great Wall to practice swordsmanship?”

Lin Junbi smiled and said, “No need to trouble Sister Ning, Junbi has his own path to walk.”

Ning Yao frowned and said, “Take back what you just said.”

Lin Junbi, feeling helpless, replied, “Is it truly to the point where an outsider must be so cautious in the Sword Qi Great Wall? If I were to draw my sword in the future, would I have to be trembling with fear?”

Ning Yao turned to look at Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan smiled and said, “Don’t mind my opinion. Ning Yao is Ning Yao.”

Yan Lu stepped forward.

He couldn’t just stand by and watch Lin Junbi lose his footing, after all, he was just a young lad. The so-called composure was mostly due to years of being influenced by the national master. For now, he was merely imitating; he hadn’t grasped the essence yet. Moreover, the pressure brought by the sword immortals watching was, in fact, immense. While Yan Lu, Zhu Mei, and the others could not perceive the signs, Yan Lu clearly understood that Lin Junbi was nearly at his breaking point. Those who overthink tend to act recklessly. Once he made a move, it would be particularly careless. After leaving the Shaoyuan Dynasty, the national master had specifically sought out Yan Lu to mention this matter, hoping that as half a disciple, Yan Lu would be able to stop his junior brother Lin Junbi at a critical moment, which was meant to help Lin Junbi win the game of life without compromising the foundations of his path.

Because in the national master’s eyes, this proud disciple Lin Junbi came to the Sword Qi Great Wall not to practice swordsmanship, but primarily to cultivate his heart. Otherwise, no matter where a genius like Lin Junbi practiced swordsmanship—whether atop a secluded mountain, in the muddy streets, or in the court—there wouldn’t be much difference. The issue lay in Lin Junbi’s excessive pride and unawareness; this was extremism. It was inevitable that Junbi’s swordsmanship was superior, and there was no need to rush. However, Junbi’s disposition needed to gravitate towards moderation, avoiding the other extreme. Otherwise, if his Dao heart became clouded and his sword heart shattered, it would be a calamity of monumental proportions.

Yan Lu actually felt a tinge of envy towards Lin Junbi, that this lad would receive such careful guidance from the national master on the path of cultivation.

Chen Pingan smiled, and almost simultaneously, he and Yan Lu stepped forward, looking at this fellow who excelled at pretending. Unfortunately, the other party only had the level of pretending to be a son; he wasn’t even good enough to pretend to be a grandson—still quite a ways off. Earlier, in the conflict at the tavern, this brother’s performance was too obvious, not subtle enough. At least from Chen Pingan's perspective, it didn’t work.

Ning Yao said, “If an outsider passes the three barriers, you might think we are bullying others, but in fact, it is a sign of respect from us sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall. What if it’s just three barriers, and you lose all three? To dare come to the Sword Qi Great Wall for tempering, to dare take a glance at the wild world, is already enough to prove your identity as a sword cultivator. But since you are so intent on scheming against the Sword Qi Great Wall and setting your own rules, that’s fine; to successfully calculate against your opponent in battle is your skill, Lin Junbi. After all, sword cultivators speak through their swords; winning is winning.”

The observing sword immortals nodded secretly, most of them smiling knowingly.

The vast majority of local sword immortals had been young once and had personally guarded the three barriers.

On the contrary, some younger sword cultivators exchanged glances. Hearing Ning Yao's words, they realized, “So we are truly so honorable? No, we initially intended to make those outsiders look foolish, right? Just like Qi Shou and his gang, plus Pang Yuanji, who should have just been a bystander, teaming up to beat that second tavern keeper. We thought it was a joke at first.” As for how that stingy second tavern keeper ended up winning, that was another story. However, coming to think of it, Ning Yao wasn’t wrong; the Sword Qi Great Wall bore no grudges against true strong individuals, regardless of where they came from in the vast world of righteousness. To some extent, they were all willing to show a bit of sincere respect.

Sword immortals like the notorious A Liang and the incredibly skilled Zuo You, along with the dashing Wei Jin from the small Baoping Continent.

Among the young, there was the divine presence of Cao Ci and then the shameless Chen Pingan.

Lin Junbi took a deep breath. “Do you have to insist that I draw my sword and fight?”

“The earlier words were merely polite remarks. I hope you draw your sword; I just find you displeasing,” Ning Yao replied. “Since you claim to be young and ignorant, I’ll press down further than you. If you dare not draw your sword, how will you dare to draw it against your elders?”

At this point, Ning Yao turned and looked at the girl standing between Gao Youqing and Pang Yuanji, whose eyes were red and swollen. “What are you crying for? Go home and cry.”

At this moment, Gao Youqing had no tear stains left on her face, but she was still frightened and quickly wiped her face.

Yan Lu, sensing danger in an instant, was about to act but saw Chen Pingan’s gaze and hesitated for a moment.

Lin Junbi felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave.

On the street, with flashes of sword light all around, it was as if Lin Junbi were trapped within a great formation of flying swords.

Dozens of “life-bound flying swords,” as if wielded by sword immortals of the upper five realms and earth immortals, surrounded the young Lin Junbi. The purity of the sword intent and the intensity of the killing aura showed no signs of imitation.

Each flying sword hovering around Lin Junbi pointed at different critical points, all of which were essential acupoints in his practice.

But what truly chilled Lin Junbi’s spine and made his heart feel like it was being ripped apart was the sight of a flying sword hovering a foot away, its tip aimed directly at his brow.

Lin Junbi’s life-bound flying sword was named “Killing the Flood Dragon.”

And the one before him was precisely the “Killing the Flood Dragon.”

Naturally, Lin Junbi’s life-bound flying sword resided in his life-bound acupoint. The flying sword before him was certainly a replica, but aside from Lin Junbi being unable to connect with it spiritually, the aura, sword energy, and divine intent were strikingly similar to his own life-bound flying sword. Lin Junbi even suspected that this replica of Killing the Flood Dragon, which absolutely shouldn’t exist in the world, might genuinely possess the innate divine powers of the Killing the Flood Dragon.

Not just Lin Junbi, but even Chen Pingan understood at this moment why Ning Yao had casually mentioned to him before, “To me, the realm doesn’t hold much meaning.”

It was just unfortunate that Ning Yao had always disliked discussing her cultivation with Chen Pingan.

More often, she patiently listened to Chen Pingan’s trivial chatter, at most swatting away his hands when they reached out sneakily.

After experiencing the depths of despair, Lin Junbi found himself facing an even greater despair.

If the sight of Ning Yao summoning so many unknown flying swords, especially those that could imitate his life-bound flying sword, and surrounding him with dozens of attacking flying swords was already shocking enough, then there were also dozens of flying swords on Ning Yao’s side forming a formation, each one linked together, creating a veritable small world. Despite Ning Yao’s true realm being that of the Sea Observation Realm, she was completely enmeshed within it. Although she was indeed in the Sea Observation Realm, what did that even mean in this context?

Not to mention Lin Junbi, even his senior brother Yan Lu, who was at the Golden Core bottleneck, would find it quite difficult to break open a small world with a flying sword.

Ning Yao calmly said, “Draw your sword.”

Lin Junbi was stunned, not drawing his sword, and trembled as he asked, “Why is it that although this is swordsmanship, it can reach such profound levels?”

Ning Yao replied, “Before all techniques and laws in the world, there is swordsmanship; didn’t you know? You wouldn’t think that the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall only use their swords and flying swords to smash into battles, would you?”

Ning Yao looked at the young man, shook her head, and withdrew the flying swords and the small world beside her.

The dozens of flying swords that had been hovering around Lin Junbi vanished without a trace.

Yan Lu softly shouted, “Not good!”

Yan Lu stepped forward, no longer caring to conceal his cultivation, and intended to stop Lin Junbi from rashly summoning his life-bound flying sword.

Chen Pingan had noticed the young man’s malicious intentions but still made no move, his hands tucked within his sleeves, calmly leaving the battlefield to Ning Yao.

Ning Yao’s realm was the first among her peers; her numerous battle achievements and significant contributions outside the city were no less than Chen Pingan’s.

A petite and exquisite sword formation appeared in front of Ning Yao, drawing in golden light. Lin Junbi’s suddenly manifested flying sword, Killing the Flood Dragon, was firmly held within it.

Not only that. The dozens of flying swords that had previously flickered around Lin Junbi now shot toward him like arrows, simultaneously piercing through dozens of acupoints on Lin Junbi’s body. Then they abruptly halted, their tips facing outward, while their hilts pointed toward the young man. Among them was the replica of Killing the Flood Dragon, which flashed past Lin Junbi’s brow and suspended a foot behind him, the tip coalescing a drop of blood.

Lin Junbi was drenched in blood, teetering on the edge of collapse.

Lin Junbi’s gaze was fixed on Ning Yao, who seemed like a sword immortal already.

The young man, who was destined to lose and should have admitted defeat, suddenly felt two points of golden light flicker deep within his eyes.

It turned out to be two life-bound flying swords he had concealed and nurtured for many years in his eyes. This indicated that Lin Junbi was just like Qi Shou, possessing three innate flying swords.

However, those dozens of hovering flying swords that had only lightly injured the young man traced colorful arcs of sword light, their tips converging before Lin Junbi’s eyes.

Lin Junbi remained motionless.

Yet the boy’s Yin spirit emerged, moving sideways a few steps, holding a long sword, poised to strike at Ning Yao.

Ning Yao remained still, her own ethereal Yin spirit, resembling a celestial being, holding a semi-immortal weapon that had long since been refined into a life-bound item. Without so much as a glance at Lin Junbi’s Yin spirit, she held her sword with one hand, the tip of her sword already pressed against the young man’s forehead.

Ning Yao’s true self slowly spoke, “To withhold from killing you is harder than to kill you at random. So, you should cherish your life.”

Only at this moment did Lin Junbi understand what the national master had meant about being a genius and still having a chasm between them.

Lin Junbi was drenched in blood, his eyes dim, and his heart felt like dead wood.

Yan Lu, to show his sincerity, did not rush things. He stepped up beside Lin Junbi, placing a hand on the young man's shoulder, and solemnly stated, “One cannot play chess without a winner or loser!”

Lin Junbi’s gaze regained some of its former brightness.

An observing sword immortal smiled and said, “That was too unfulfilling; even if Ning Yao pressed down, she still held back most of her power.”

A nearby sword immortal friend said, “That’s enough. We were probably far worse than that boy at that age.”

Sword immortal Tao Wen suddenly interjected, “Maybe it’s just that he drank too much of Chen Pingan’s wine.”

Many sword immortals and cultivators agreed.

An old sword immortal in the Immortal Realm laughed, “Ning Yao, my ‘Crossing Stars Duel’ is terribly inadequate in imitation. Do you look down on my life-bound flying sword or something?”

An old sword immortal watching from his residence on Taixiang Street scoffed, “That broken sword of yours is fundamentally flawed. Every time it goes into battle, it’s all head and no tail. Even if it looks somewhat like it, what good is that?”

Liu Tiefu wiped his eyes, filled with excitement. No wonder he only dared to admire the strong Ning Yao from a distance; she was truly formidable.

Chen Pingan, with his hands tucked in his sleeves, plainly told Lin Junbi, “Winning or losing is just a small matter for you; maintaining face is merely a slightly larger matter. Besides, how much could you possibly lose by letting my Ning Yao draw her sword? So don’t put on an act with me; just happily accept what you’ve gained and take it home to enjoy. Otherwise, I might truly be unkind to you.”

Then, Chen Pingan smiled at Yan Lu, saying, “You worried for nothing.”

Lin Junbi ignored him, retracting his Yin spirit and sheathing his sword, cupping his fists and bowing his head. “Thank you, Senior Ning, for your guidance in swordsmanship. This lesson will be etched in my heart for life.”

Ning Yao retracted her Yin spirit and said, “As you wish; I won’t remember who you are anyway.”

Then, Ning Yao turned to Yan Lu and Liu Tiefu on the street. “Are you still watching the show?”

Liu Tiefu leaped up, exclaiming “Wow!” Ning Yao actually looked at him; he felt nervous, truly a bit nervous.

Yan Lu, however, felt that this fight had lost its meaning, whether he won or lost. Winning was unexciting, and losing was embarrassing. No matter how the two sides fought next, it seemed few would be interested in seeing it unfold.

Once that girl withdrew, the sword immortals had already grouped together, departing on their flying swords, each one of them high and mighty, leaving as if they were quite pleased.

Lin Junbi turned to leave, swaying unsteadily.

Ning Yao’s strike hadn’t harmed the foundation of his cultivation; it was just a rather dismal sight.

As for this match’s outcome, just as that fellow had said, Ning Yao proved that her swordsmanship was indeed exceptional, yet it hadn’t deeply injured Lin Junbi’s Dao heart. There would certainly be some impact; for the next few years, Lin Junbi would likely feel a shadow looming over his sword heart, as if an invisible mountain were suppressing his inner lake. However, Lin Junbi believed he could dispel this gloom and remove the mountain; it was the words of Chen Pingan, who stood outside of the battle, that truly gnawed at him, leaving him filled with frustration.

Yan Lu was the first to walk to Lin Junbi’s side.

Lin Junbi’s face was pale, and he said softly with a smile, “I’m fine; I can take the loss.”

Yan Lu turned to look at that annoying young man in the green robe, feeling somewhat strange; this Chen Pingan had a different kind of annoying than Cao Ci’s.

Cao Ci’s martial arts were awe-inspiring, and being close to him felt like looking up at a great mountain. Thus, even if Cao Ci remained silent, he gave others the impression of, “You really can’t defeat me; I advise you not to act.” Yet that Chen Pingan seemed to have “You will definitely be able to defeat me; why not give it a try?” written on his forehead.

Yan Lu couldn’t help but sigh, wondering if he had encountered some kind of enlightened senior among his peers.

Lin Junbi and Yan Lu left; Jiang Guancheng and the others followed behind.

Lin Junbi did not forget to nod to a Golden Core sword cultivator, who returned the gesture.

Zhu Mei, still unwilling to leave, kept five or six people with her to stay behind.

After all, there were still two more barriers to pass.

Zhu Mei felt somewhat strange; that formidable Ning Yao had left her in awe after witnessing her draw her sword only once. What an overwhelming admiration it sparked! But why would Ning Yao be interested in the man beside her? In matters of love, how could the divine fairy Ning be so naïve?

Chen Pingan and Ning Yao walked over to Yan Zhuo and the others.

After Ning Yao appeared, no one dared to cheer or jeer along the way.

No wonder the Sword Qi Great Wall was known for a saying: What happens when Ning Yao draws her sword? It doesn’t matter if she is a realm higher.

This made Chen Pingan both happy and aggrieved. Why was it that only he was so unappreciated? Many bastards had shared drinks and camaraderie with him at the table or while squatting on the roadside eating pickled vegetables.

He conversed with a radiant demeanor, quietly chatting with Ning Yao.

Chen Pingan rubbed his chin thoughtfully and turned to ask Fan Dache, “Dache, what do you think of me?”

Fan Dache felt a bit flustered. “What now?”

Chen Pingan sincerely inquired, “Is there anything I should improve? I really like hearing others speak frankly about my shortcomings.”

Fan Dache shook his head. “No!”

Ning Yao smiled and nodded at the side.

Fan Dache nearly shed tears. It turned out that if he didn’t say something good, Ning Yao would truly take it to heart. It seemed like Ning Yao hadn’t been this kind of person before.

On the street.

Yan Lu and Liu Tiefu began the second round of battle.

In contrast to the instantaneous victory between Lin Junbi and Gao Youqing, the two fought back and forth, employing a myriad of techniques.

Chen Pingan watched intently.

Chen Sanqiu asked in confusion, “Is it really necessary to watch this attentively?”

Chen Pingan nodded, carefully observing the complex trajectories of both sides’ flying swords, and smiled, “Among you friends, I treat them all as life-and-death adversaries.”

Fan Dache hesitated and tentatively asked, “Am I also considered a friend?”

Chen Pingan instinctively retracted his gaze, looking at Fan Dache. “Of course.”

Fan Dache mustered his courage and said, “A friend is a friend, but I’m not as good as Sanqiu and the others, right? Otherwise, when you speak with me, you wouldn’t need to deliberately make eye contact with me.”

Chen Pingan couldn’t help but be taken aback for a moment, neither confirming nor denying it, he smiled and said, “Why does a big man like you have to be so meticulous?”

Except for Ning Yao, everyone laughed heartily at Chen Pingan.

Fan Dache quietly shifted, forcing a smile, and lightly nudged Chen Sanqiu, “Five snowflake coins for a pot of wine; I understand.”

Chen Sanqiu retorted, “You understand nothing.”

Chen Pingan suddenly said, “Dache, in the future, go to the Ning residence frequently with Sanqiu. We will take turns to spar with you; remember that if you truly break through, go to the tavern to drink and shout a few times. That pot of wine for five snowflake coins will be my congratulatory gift to you.”

Fan Dache was momentarily stunned into silence.

Chen Sanqiu stepped on Fan Dache’s foot, and only then did Fan Dache come back to his senses, replying with a “yes” that he had no problem with.

In the second round, just as Chen Pingan had anticipated, Yan Lu narrowly won.

Liu Tiefu didn’t lose face either.

On both sides of the street, jeers rang out. With a thick skin, Liu Tiefu grinned, cupped his hands, and thanked the observing sword immortals.

In the third round, Situ Weiran was in charge of guarding the gate.

His opponent was a Golden Core sword cultivator named Jin Zhenmeng, who had recently broken through and entered the realm of earth immortal sword cultivators. In his thirties, he was also a highly renowned prodigy of the Shaoyuan Dynasty. However, in this journey south, all his brilliance was overshadowed by Lin Junbi, Yan Lu’s swordsmanship talent, and the illustrious backgrounds of Zhu Mei and Jiang Guancheng. Additionally, Jin Zhenmeng was not the type of sword cultivator who liked to stand out. Even knowing that he was Lin Junbi’s only “sacrificial piece,” he bore little resentment. Being able to question swordsmanship alongside true talents of his generation was enough for Jin Zhenmeng, the oldest of the group. Accompanying the many young prodigies south to the Overturned Mountain, staying at the Meihua Garden, and later arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall at Sun Jiansen’s residence, Jin Zhenmeng would comply with whatever Lin Junbi arranged, but he had many small schemes of his own, all related to swords.

Thus, this round of guarding the gate, although the outcome was a foregone conclusion, was still the most like a genuine sword inquiry.

Situ Weiran did not rush to draw his sword and seek a quick victory; he treated this session as a form of training.

After a joss stick’s worth of time, Jin Zhenmeng sheathed his sword and admitted defeat. The usually proud Situ Weiran rarely showed a smile, and after sheathing his sword, he returned the courtesy.

In fact, speaking of the three rounds of battles, Lin Junbi’s side had come away triumphant.

However, at this point, no one from Lin Junbi’s side felt they had won even a fraction.

After the three rounds concluded, the observing sword cultivators scattered from the street.

Many went directly to the tavern near the stacked peaks. After watching the match, they wanted to see more. The food and drink today was quite enjoyable, much better than those plates of overly salty pickled vegetables. However, now that there was a bowl of free plain noodles, they could endure the second tavern keeper.

Ning Yao did not join the crowd at the tavern, stating that she would return to cultivate. She merely reminded Chen Pingan that since he was injured, he should drink less.

Yan Zhuo asked, “What happened?”

Chen Pingan replied in a light-hearted tone, “I’ve been refining my life-bound item these past few days, and ran into a bit of trouble.”

Yan Zhuo didn’t press for more information.

Chen Sanqiu also kept quiet. 

Earlier, it seemed a strange phenomenon had occurred at the Ning residence, which even ordinary sword immortals were unaware of; it had alarmed the elder Chen Xi, who had been practicing swordsmanship at the time. Chen Sanqiu was completely befuddled, not knowing why the elder showed up. The elder merely smiled at Chen Sanqiu, saying, “The old monk at the city wall, who has been dozing for many years, is likely to open his eyes and take a look now.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 700: Friends Coming from Afar

The residence of Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan was no different from the luxurious mansions of the secular aristocracy in the world of Haoran. However, the divine wealth expended to create this "similarity" was an astonishing sum.

Sun Juyuan sat on a bamboo mat that nearly covered the entire corridor, with exquisite paperweights of various materials pressing down on each corner of the mat.

Standing nearby was the Middle Kingdom's Sword Immortal Ku Xia, his expression grave.

Sun Juyuan chuckled, “Things don’t start smoothly; don’t blame Lin Junbi for any omissions. Blame your name instead. It’s summer now, and with you being called ‘Ku Xia’ (Bitter Summer), isn’t that dragging Lin Junbi along with you?”

Ku Xia sighed, “He shouldn’t have provoked Ning Yao.”

Sun Juyuan laughed, “Isn’t that an obvious statement? How many Sword Immortals were there watching the battle earlier? Thirty? If you count those who didn’t show up, we haven’t had this much excitement in ages.”

Ku Xia sighed, “If someone like her were to marry into the Shaoyuan Dynasty, it would be a tremendous blessing. The fortune of our swordsmanship might just rise like a mountain.”

Sun Juyuan scoffed, “Stop daydreaming. Lin Junbi is already considered the embodiment of your Shaoyuan Dynasty’s sword fortune. What’s more? Ning Yao hasn’t even remembered his name. Besides, Ning Yao once left the Sword Qi Great Wall alone and traveled through many continents of your Haoran world, and no one could keep her there. So, if you lack the ability to hold onto her, don’t blame Ning Yao for being picky.”

Suddenly, Sun Juyuan seemed taken aback, “Your Shaoyuan Dynasty’s National Master wouldn’t really have the intention of luring Lin Junbi over here, would he? Is Lin Junbi even aware of that?”

Ku Xia fell silent.

Sun Juyuan’s expression grew serious as he said, “If that’s the case, I advise you to abandon that thought immediately, and make sure Lin Junbi does as well. Some matters, no matter how much face your National Master has, cannot outweigh a Sword Immortal's life and path. If Lin Junbi, this inexperienced rookie, doesn’t know the stakes, then he wouldn’t even need Ning Yao to take action. Just that Chen Pingan alone could lead him and his group to ruin, along with that border area.”

Ku Xia turned his head, puzzled, “I’ve heard some things about this young man. The Sword Immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall fear him; I’m not surprised. But why do you, a Sword Immortal, regard him so highly?”

As for certain insider information, even with the deep friendship shared with Sun Juyuan, Sword Immortal Ku Xia would not divulge more, so he chose not to delve further.

Sun Juyuan sat cross-legged, flipping his palm to reveal a wine cup. He shook it lightly, and exquisite wine filled the cup as if summoned. This cup was a treasure sought after by wine lovers across the world, far surpassing even the finest of wines, for it was called the “Wine Spring.” Unless one drank incessantly for an entire day and downed a hundred jin (about 50 kg) of wine, this small cup was essentially a bottomless barrel of wine. Therefore, there were only three of these cups in the Sword Qi Great Wall.

One was in Sun Juyuan's hand, another belonged to Yan Ming, but since that Sword Immortal lost both arms and fell from grace, he seemed to have stopped drinking. The last one was with the old Sword Immortal of the Qi family.

Historically, there had been as many as five Wine Spring cups in the Sword Qi Great Wall, but due to some gambling schemes from back in the day, a few were lost, and it was unknown whether they returned to the Haoran world or ended up in a place beyond the skies of the Qingming world. After obtaining them, they even pretended it was a good thing, claiming it was a match made in heaven, lest they end up alone like their master.

Sun Juyuan drank the wine in one gulp, and the cup filled once more as if springing forth from a fountain. He smiled and asked, “Ku Xia, what do you think it means for a person to be truly impressive?”

Ku Xia shook his head, “I’ve never thought about it and am too lazy to consider it. So please, enlighten me, Sword Immortal Sun.”

Sun Juyuan pinched the wine cup between his fingers, slowly turning it while gazing into the ripples within. He spoke softly, “It’s about making good people feel that this person is good, and even those who are enemies, regardless of their stance, deep down, are willing to acknowledge this person as a good person.”

Ku Xia pondered for a while and nodded, “That’s terrifying.”

Sun Juyuan shook his head, “That’s not even the worst part.”

Ku Xia frowned, “What do you mean?”

Sun Juyuan continued slowly, “What’s even more terrifying is that this person might genuinely be a good person.”

This is how I perceive the world; the world should perceive me likewise.

Sun Juyuan recalled the book of the hundred Sword Immortals, where one seal bore the inscription “Observe the Dao, Observe the Dao, Observe the Dao.”

Quite intriguing.

Unfortunately, the seal that caught Sun Juyuan’s eye long ago had long since vanished, taken by some Sword Immortal who had stealthily pocketed it.

Suddenly, Sun Juyuan laughed, glancing into the distance with a cold gaze, “What a bunch of little chicks. Lin Junbi is understandable; after all, he’s clever. It’s just unfortunate that he crossed paths with Ning Yao. Even if that Chen Pingan deliberately laid it bare, enjoying the advantage while keeping it low-key, he should have kept a low profile. As for the rest, that Jiang whatever, is your direct disciple, right? Coming to play at our Sword Qi Great Wall? If there’s no fight, that’s fine, but if a battle truly breaks out, are you going to send those yelping beasts heads on a platter? Aren’t you tired, Sword Immortal? Or is this the kind of atmosphere prevalent in your Shaoyuan Dynasty now? I remember when you, Ku Xia, came here years ago, it wasn’t like this, was it?”

Sword Immortal Ku Xia didn’t respond, remaining silent for a moment before speaking, “The National Master has decreed that even if a great war breaks out, they cannot leave the city walls.”

Sun Juyuan slapped his forehead, finishing his drink to drown his sorrows, lamenting, “This place has become a stinking street. Sword Immortal Ku Xia, it seems I, Sun Juyuan, have been harmed the most by you.”

Sword Immortal Ku Xia felt a bit guilty but said nothing further; there was no need for pleasantries with a friend like Sun Juyuan.

Yet this disciple of his, one of the ten from the Middle Kingdom, already a prominent pillar of the Shaoyuan Dynasty, couldn’t help but wonder if perhaps his name, Ku Xia, was indeed somewhat prophetic.

At the pavilion, Lin Junbi had already changed into a ceremonial robe, his demeanor returning to normal, exuding the freshness of a youthful immortal. 

The border area, which showed signs of tension, was likely the only sword cultivator wearing a troubled expression. 

Most of the other young people were seething with anger, cursing loudly, while the remaining few offered words of misguided consolation, believing themselves to be the voice of reason. 

The border area honestly didn’t understand why these kids came to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Didn’t their elders teach them the significance of guarding the three passes before parting? Or was it simply that the younger generation was reckless because their elders didn’t know how to behave? All they knew was to arrive at the Sword Qi Great Wall and act meekly, which only fueled their rebellious mindset. 

As for the ferocity of the wild world and the siege of the demonic clans, no one really understood what it entailed. The border area could even confirm that including Lin Junbi, the potential enemies in their minds were merely fellow sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall. The concepts of the wild world and the demonic clans weren’t even on their radar. 

The border area itself was fine because, during his travels in the Liuxia Continent, he had personally experienced the savage combat prowess and resilience of a Nascent Soul demon. Together with a Nascent Soul sword cultivator companion, they had struck countless times but ultimately failed to injure the demon. It was only with the help of an additional Golden Core sword cultivator that they managed to trap and kill it by sheer attrition.

Crossing the three passes was no easy feat.

The Sword Qi Great Wall hoped that these foreign sword cultivators would become more discerning and realize the difficulty of winning each battle fought there. They also wanted to remind the younger foreign sword cultivators, especially those with little battle experience, that once war began, it was best to stay safely on the city walls, exerting just enough effort to control their flying swords, and to never act impulsively, rushing down to the battlefield. The many Sword Immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall would not deliberately restrain such reckless actions, nor would they be able to pay too much attention.

As for those who came purely to hone their sword skills at the Sword Qi Great Wall, they were not unwelcome; whether they could truly establish themselves or gain favor from a certain Sword Immortal willing to teach superior sword techniques was ultimately based on their own abilities.

“How old is Junbi now? And how old is Ning Yao? Winning without strength, yet still pressuring others with words—this is the so-called young first among the Sword Immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall? To me, the killing power of the Sword Immortals here, no matter how great, is truly as small as a needle’s eye.”

“That Ning Yao clearly knows that in the upcoming battle of the three passes, the people of the Sword Qi Great Wall can’t gain any advantage from us, so she is deliberately forcing Junbi to draw his sword, thus acting all high and mighty!”

“Exactly! And those observing Sword Immortals, each with ulterior motives, are intentionally creating pressure on Junbi.”

Jiang Guancheng sneered, “In my opinion, that Ning Yao doesn’t actually have any intention of pressuring others; it’s all a facade. She simply wants to use underhanded tactics to win against Junbi, so she can uphold her pitiful reputation. If Ning Yao is like this, then Pang Yuanji, Qi Shou, and Gao Yehou—those sword cultivators who can barely be considered peers—can’t be much better either. Truly befitting of a barbaric land!”

The border area rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on.

Fortunately, Lin Junbi frowned and reminded, “Jiang Guancheng! Watch your words!”

Only then did Jiang Guancheng shut his mouth, though his expression was still filled with resentment.

Among the crowd, Zhu Mei remained silent.

Golden Core Sword Cultivator Jin Zhenmeng hadn’t spoken much either.

Zhu Mei recalled the earlier battle where Gao Youqing had lost, her face crumpled, tears flowing as she stood silently beside Gao Yehou and Pang Yuanji. And then there was Liu Tiexiu, who lost his sword and was jeered at by the observing Sword Immortals; yet this young Liu Tiexiu could still smile through the mockery, bowing in thanks.

Jin Zhenmeng remembered how Situ Weiran smiled and returned the courtesy after defeating her.

And when Ning Yao appeared, the atmosphere on the street suddenly turned solemn—not merely a simple matter of holding one’s breath to watch the excitement.

A twelve-year-old girl, the youngest among them, was particularly furious, her anger simmering as she softly said, “Especially that Chen Pingan, always targeting Junbi. Clearly, he feels inferior; what does it matter if he beats Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji? He’s just the disciple of the Sage of Literature, with a master who’s a great Sword Immortal, receiving guidance from a legendary figure year after year, endowed with countless treasures. Is that true ability? If Junbi were to wait ten more years, I bet that when Chen Pingan stands in front of him, he wouldn’t even dare to breathe!”

The border area internally wailed, oh my little aunt, you can’t say such things just because you like Junbi!

Lin Junbi shook his head, “Chen Pingan is not as simple as you think.”

Lin Junbi smiled and added, “If my opponent is too weak, doesn’t that just mean I’m mediocre?”

Hearing this, the girl’s eyes sparkled with admiration for Junbi.

The border area made up his mind never to get involved in the muddled affairs of these young masters and young ladies again.

Let them do as they please.

I’m done serving them.

But to be fair, the border area wasn’t really serving them; he was merely watching the show along the way. The only fortune was that half of his master’s National Master had honestly stated that these kids would not participate in the great war. Once the Sword Qi Great Wall commenced battle with the demonic clans, they would immediately retreat back to the Plum Blossom Garden of the Hanging Mountain and then make their way back to the Middle Kingdom, preferably without even lingering in the Southern Posa Continent.

The border area rubbed his face with both hands, silently muttering to himself, you can’t see me, I can’t see you.

Unfortunately, Jiang Guancheng didn’t let him off the hook and brightly declared, “So it turns out Border Area Senior Brother is the most hidden one! That Chen Pingan is obviously very concerned about whether Border Area Senior Brother will take action.”

The border area looked exasperated; can’t you see how blind you are?

Just as Jiang Guancheng spoke, the proverbial window paper was pierced, and discussions erupted. The border area listened to the sincere flattery but felt not a shred of joy.

Just thinking about that young man with his hands in his sleeves and a smile, the border area felt inexplicably uneasy, sensing that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

Ignoring the compliments and the subtle provocations from those fellows, the border area turned to Lin Junbi.

Lin Junbi smiled, “I’ll be careful.”

Only then did the border area let out a slight sigh of relief.

Looking back now, it seemed that the choice made by his junior brother Lin Junbi to break through twice, with his own strength overcoming the Observing Sea Realm, Dragon Gate Realm, and Golden Core Realm—successfully passing all three challenges—might indeed be the best option.

Perhaps in the eyes of many observing Sword Immortals, it would garner more goodwill towards Lin Junbi, rather than seeing him as a joke leaning towards Ning Yao.

Even if Chen Pingan was given the opportunity for a fourth match, what advantage could he gain? If Lin Junbi lost, it would still be a win; the more thrilling the battle, the more goodwill he would inspire, akin to how Chen Pingan battled Pang Yuanji. If it could directly let Ning Yao draw her sword rather than letting Chen Pingan appear to capitalize on the situation, Lin Junbi would naturally gain even more.

But all these were just “ifs.”

The border area wouldn’t be foolish enough to ask his junior brother if he regretted it.

Nor would he mention that his earlier words to Lin Junbi about “competing with others for victory is meaningless” were meant to remind him to strive against himself.

Because saying it would only create enmity.

As the summer solstice approached, the sun shone brightly.

At the tavern, Chen Pingan, unaware of how many curses he had incurred for not drinking, took a stool to the street corner, explaining the origins of the twenty-four solar terms to the newly gathered children, tossing in sayings from his hometown like, “Small fullness is not full; without water, wash the bowl; wheat has a risk.”

Unfortunately, today the children showed little interest in learning about the twenty-four solar terms or Chen Pingan’s pretentious dialogues. Instead, they were buzzing with questions about how Ning Yao had drawn her sword so unusually on Xuanzhou Street. 

Chen Pingan waved the bamboo branch in his hand, speaking enthusiastically. A little boy named Le Kang, whose father helped run the tavern and made spring noodles, had grown bold enough to boast to his mother about it at home. 

This child still loved to stir trouble, asking how many Chen Pingans it would take to defeat Sister Ning Yao. 

Chen Pingan found himself at a loss and rolled his eyes at the children.

Little brat Feng Kangle shook his head, patting Chen Pingan’s knee, and said with a maturity that belied his age, “Chen Pingan, you always come here idly wandering instead of practicing martial arts and swordsmanship. I think Sister Ning will soon think you have no skill. What’s the point of beating Pang Yuanji? Look at you, acting all high and mighty here, fishing for compliments, but you hardly practice. That won’t do!”

The other children nodded in agreement.

Chen Pingan laid the bamboo branch across his lap, reached out to press down on Kangle’s cheek, and smiled, “You better shut up.”

The little brat reached out to hit Chen Pingan, but his short arms couldn't reach.

A young boy squatting at the edge recalled the earlier ruckus and, grinning, said, “Kangle, speak louder! I, Chen Pingan, the esteemed disciple of the Sage of Literature, can’t hear you!”

Laughter erupted around them, echoing like thunder.

Now, there was plenty of gossip about this second tavern keeper.

Chen Pingan laughed, “If it weren’t for you little brats being so young, I’d punch one and kick two, and with one sword swing, you’d all scatter!”

Feng Kangle rubbed his cheek, stood up, and stretched his neck. Oh no, the most beautiful girl in the world, standing just a short distance away, was looking at him.

What to do?!

Earlier, he had relied on a few of Chen Pingan’s stories to win her over during their playtime, promising to be her little husband. Later, he had explained to her the meaning of the name of her small alley. Now, when he saw her on the street, even though she still didn’t talk much to him, her eyes were clearly sparkling with interest.

So, Feng Kangle straightened up, secretly signaling to Chen Pingan, then softly complained, “Chen Pingan, it’s all your fault. If she ignores me from now on, I’ll surely blame you!”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “In honor of Kangle’s father’s spring noodles, today I’ll tell you all a thrilling story about water ghosts! It’s guaranteed to be exciting!”

A youth scoffed, “Chen Pingan, first tell us what level the protagonist who fights demons and upholds justice is at. Don’t let it turn out to be some crummy low-level cultivator in the end. Otherwise, according to your tales, with so many sword cultivators in the Sword Qi Great Wall, every single one would be a hero or a celestial being in your hometown, right? How could that be?”

Someone chimed in, “Yeah, right! You always make those monsters sound so intimidating that I end up thinking they’re all great demons from the wild world!”

Chen Pingan coughed a few times, recalling something, then turned his head and opened his palm. A little girl crouching beside him quickly handed him a handful of sunflower seeds, which he poured into his hand. Smiling, he returned half to her and began cracking the seeds as he said, “Today’s story is about a young sword immortal who ventured out with his sword. He’s definitely at a sufficient level, and he’s quite the dashing figure. Countless young heroines in the martial world and celestial maidens are infatuated with him. However, this sword immortal, named Qi Jinglong, remains indifferent, having yet to encounter a true love interest. And the water ghost he will eventually face is certainly terrifying. How terrifying? Let me tell you. You know those puddles you see anywhere, like a little water puddle in the alley after it rains or a bowl of water on your table? Just lift the lid off a big water jar and take a quick look, and you might see—oh dear! Not just you, but even that sword immortal named Qi Jinglong, when passing by a river and taking a sip, would see a pale face emerge from the water weeds, scaring him out of his wits!”

A child was so scared that he jumped and cried, “Chen Pingan, you scoundrel!”

Suddenly, someone asked, “Who is this Qi Jinglong?”

Chen Pingan laughed, “He’s a young sword immortal who loves to drink but pretends he doesn’t. He loves to lecture and is quite annoying.”

Feng Kangle asked, “How old is this sword immortal?”

Chen Pingan replied, “Under a hundred, I believe.”

Feng Kangle clicked his tongue, “Is that supposed to be a young sword immortal? You better change that to ‘old sword immortal.’”

Chen Pingan pinched the little brat’s cheek, “He’s a good friend of mine; how dare you talk like that?”

Feng Kangle grinned, sticking out his bottom, and playfully punched Chen Pingan’s shoulder, “I’m not polite to you, so why should I be polite to your friend?”

The fair-skinned girl in the distance slightly opened her mouth, probably surprised that Kangle could be so bold with Chen Pingan; it seemed Kangle wasn’t just boasting when he talked to her.

Chen Pingan shot Feng Kangle a knowing glance, and the little brat nodded slightly, as if to say, I understand.

A keen-eyed boy nearby couldn’t help but roll his eyes, thinking that this second tavern keeper was indeed quite idle. Did he not need to practice? Was he just here to mess around with them?

After finishing that thrilling story that startled the children, Chen Pingan moved on to the tavern. 

With Chen Sanqiu present, at least there would be a long table to sit at.

Young Zhang Jiazhen was helping out, responsible for serving wine or a bowl of spring noodles to the sword cultivators. The boy didn’t speak much but always wore a smile, which was enough.

Today, when Chen Pingan joined the table, he didn’t drink but simply asked Zhang Jiazhen for a bowl of spring noodles and a plate of pickles, ultimately finding that Chen Sanqiu and Yan Pizi’s persuasion skills for drinking were lacking.

Before returning to Ning’s residence, Chen Pingan reminded Fan Dache, “Dache.”

Fan Dache, who was busy with a bowl of spring noodles, immediately grew anxious. He had learned that whenever Chen Pingan said his name, it meant trouble, so he quickly replied, “I’ve already ordered a jar of wine for five snowflake coins! If you don’t drink, that’s not my fault!”

Chen Pingan put down his chopsticks and said irritably, “I’ve said before that I’d come often. Don’t take it lightly. Don’t let me wait at your door every day begging you to spar. If I accidentally go too hard and you end up crawling home, your parents wouldn’t recognize you and would kick you out!”

Fan Dache nodded.

Chen Pingan smiled at Fan Dache.

Fan Dache looked puzzled.

Chen Sanqiu turned to the boy who was constantly watching the customers and called, “Zhang Jiazhen, get me a jar of the cheapest wine! I’ll pay, but make sure to remind me to charge it to Fan Dache. Next time we drink, ask me if Fan Dache has paid me back.”

Zhang Jiazhen nodded vigorously and hurried into the tavern to bring back a jar of Bamboo Sea Cave wine.

For this boy from the rundown alley, Mr. Chen was like a celestial being.

The young master Chen Sanqiu, who lived on Taixiang Street, was also one.

If it weren’t for working at the tavern, Zhang Jiazhen might never have had the chance to speak even half a sentence with Chen Sanqiu, let alone have his name remembered.

Zhang Jiazhen had never even been to Taixiang Street or Xuanzhou Street, not once.

No one stopped them, but not just Zhang Jiazhen; in fact, the children from Lingxi Alley and Yanchi Alley—whose names sounded beautiful yet lived in extreme poverty—never thought of going to those places. Perhaps they would occasionally think about it but ultimately lacked the courage to make the journey.

Chen Pingan smiled at Zhang Jiazhen and then pointed at Fan Dache, taking the wine and getting up to leave.

Fan Dache continued to eat his bowl of spring noodles.

To be honest, if it weren’t for Chen Pingan’s last remark, Fan Dache wouldn’t have known how to get to Ning’s residence.

What if it was a polite gesture? What does “often sparring” even mean? Once every three days? Once a month?

Was the gate to Ning’s residence so easy to cross?

Fan Dache raised his head, watching the figure of that person in a green shirt on the street. The man turned his head, gazing at the couplets of the various taverns along the way, occasionally shaking his head.

Upon reaching Ning’s residence, Nalan Ye Xing opened the door.

Together they walked toward the training ground, with Nalan Ye Xing holding the jar of wine, smiling as he asked, “Did you pay for it yourself?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “I learned this from Dong Heitan. If you drink wine, a true man pays for it.”

Nalan Ye Xing laughed heartily, “Wait for me to take a few sips first, then I’ll draw my sword to help you train the big dragon. That’ll give me strength!”

Chen Pingan couldn’t manage a smile anymore.

At the pavilion near Zhan Long Cliff, Ning Yao, who was supposedly back home to cultivate, had actually been chatting with Granny Bai. Upon noticing Chen Pingan’s swift return, the old woman didn’t need her young lady’s reminder; she smiled as she left the pavilion, and then Ning Yao began her cultivation.

In the small world within the training ground, Nalan Ye Xing stored away the half-empty wine jar and started to unleash his sword with great intensity.

Then, with one careless mistake, no matter how cautious Nalan Ye Xing was, Chen Pingan would end up lying down for a fortnight.

Granny Bai hurried to the training ground, and Nalan Ye Xing nearly bolted out of the house in fright.

Fortunately, Chen Pingan explained to Granny Bai that he had gained a lot from this experience and that this path of cultivation was indeed correct; besides, he didn’t even need to brew medicine, as healing himself was a form of cultivation.

Nalan Ye Xing dared not speak carelessly, truthfully replying, “Indeed.”

Chen Pingan was supported by Ning Yao as he went to the small courtyard.

Nalan Ye Xing anxiously awaited the inevitable scolding, but to his surprise, Granny Bai only looked at the backs of the two and remained silent for a long while.

Nalan Ye Xing thought this was not good; it was better to be scolded early than late. Just as he was about to speak up for a reprimand, the old woman showed no signs of wanting to start with “old dog” as a prelude; instead, she softly remarked, “Do you think the young master and young lady resemble the master and mistress when they were young?”

Nalan Ye Xing took out the wine jar and nodded, “They do resemble.”

The old woman’s face hardened, “It’s been hard on you these days.”

Nalan Ye Xing was perplexed, “What?!” 

The old woman snapped, “Old dog, go watch the gate!”

Nalan Ye Xing nodded, thinking that was more like it, and turned to head towards the gate, feeling greatly reassured.

Chen Pingan sat on the bed, beginning to breathe and meditate, immersing his mind in his personal small world.

Ning Yao sat beside him, resting her head on the table, watching Chen Pingan. In his heart, it seemed he had met someone he longed for, and a smile unconsciously appeared on her face.

She knew who it was because of the fourth fateful object. After Chen Pingan finally succeeded in refining it, he emerged from the secret chamber and, before Grandpa Nalan, he hugged Ning Yao tightly. Ning Yao had never seen Chen Pingan so unburdened before, and Grandpa Nalan immediately took the hint and left. She felt a pang of sympathy for him and hugged him back.

He was jubilant, full of energy, saying that the little guy was still around, just inside his heart, but now he had transformed into a small bald head. After their reunion, they were on the same path, with the little bald head riding the fire dragon, chasing after him and scolding him all the way.

Ning Yao seldom saw this kind of exuberance from Chen Pingan, especially the grown-up Chen Pingan. Beyond their time together, Ning Yao would sometimes worry, for Chen Pingan’s mindset seemed almost like that of a weary monk who had lived for many long years and witnessed too much of life’s joys and sorrows. Ning Yao didn’t want that for him. So, seeing that he resembled the young boy she once knew, she felt very happy.

Friends coming from afar—was a small bald head.

Yet he wasn’t clad in a cassock; he still wore a scholar's robe, but in addition to his sword, the little one had a Buddhist scripture tucked in his sleeve.

This was a long-awaited reunion that Chen Pingan had never dared to imagine; it was a meeting filled with regrets and guilt that he could not express to anyone, lingering in his mind long after waking.

His life was filled with too many goodbyes and separations that never saw a return.

Ning Yao rested her head on the table, gazing at Chen Pingan, and began to smile to herself. She recalled earlier on Xuanzhou Street when Chen Pingan hesitated for a long time before taking her hand and asking quietly, “When I was about Junbi’s age, who was more handsome?”

At the time, Ning Yao had countered, “What do you think?”

Chen Pingan then scratched his head, feeling that answer to be quite disheartening.

So Ning Yao sincerely voiced her answer, not keeping her words hidden, saying, “You’re much better looking!”

Chen Pingan then gently brushed her brow with his hands, “My silly Ning Yao, you really do have good taste!”

Before the summer solstice, Chen Pingan had almost never stepped outside, spending nearly ten hours a day practicing Qi refinement.

Ning Yao was even more outrageous, going directly into closed-door cultivation. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 701: The Old and the Young on Falling Star Mountain

As soon as the message from the Ning residence was delivered by flying sword, Fan Dache would head to the Ning residence for training. He would either take a beating from Chen Ping'an or be on the receiving end of a flying sword from either Yan Zhuo or Dong Heitan. Chen Sanqiu wouldn’t intervene; he’d have to carry Fan Dache home instead. Yan Zhuo and Dong Huafu each wielded their signature swords, Zidian and Hongzhuang; once those swords were drawn, things would only get worse for Fan Dache. Right now, he was filled with regret over his poor aptitude. He had the name “Dache” but lacked any real “enlightenment,” unable to break through his current realm.

Chen Ping'an said that once Fan Dache reached the Golden Core stage, his sword training would come to a close, and he could then spend some time singing at the tavern, marking the completion of his efforts.

For a sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall, breaking through a bottleneck was not as simple as it might seem. Reaching the Golden Core was akin to a grand coming-of-age ceremony for a sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The Sword Qi Great Wall had become one of the strongest places for sword cultivators in the world, drawing waves of sword practitioners from the righteous world to hone their skills. The mystery behind this was profound; the sword cultivators there were like pure martial artists continuously taking punches. With every moment spent fighting, their foundational skills were solidified. A solid foundation meant greater challenges in breaking through realms, as if a great Dao pressed upon their shoulders, preventing them from standing tall.

Similarly, for Fan Dache, within the Dragon Gate realm, heading to the Upside Down Mountain in the Hao Ran world would make breaking through significantly easier. However, such a breakthrough would yield a lower quality Golden Core, which would ultimately be unwise in the long run. Only those earth immortal cultivators who truly had no hope of breaking through in the Sword Qi Great Wall would go to the Upside Down Mountain for a period, hoping for luck. After all, every realm above the Golden Core could grant decades or even centuries of life.

However, sword cultivators below the Golden Core were strictly prohibited from training at the Upside Down Mountain, a hard rule of the Sword Qi Great Wall aimed at thoroughly eliminating any sense of luck among young sword cultivators. Therefore, when Ning Yao left home secretly to go to the Upside Down Mountain, even with her talent, there was no need for her to take such shortcuts. The senior sword cultivators turned a blind eye to it, and with Ah Liang secretly protecting her, following her all the way to the Upside Down Mountain’s catching and releasing pavilion, nobody truly obstructed Ning Yao.

In recent sparring sessions, Chen Ping'an teamed up with Fan Dache, while Yan Zhuo and Dong Huafu formed their own team. They could use their innate flying swords freely, but chose to wield only wooden sticks for their duels. The unique rules dictated that if anyone’s wooden sword broke first, both sides would lose. Consequently, the pile of broken wooden sticks left on the sparring ground was almost entirely used up by Fan Dache, thanks to Chen Ping'an rescuing him every time.

Regardless, Fan Dache could finally leave the Ning residence on his own two feet. Before heading home, he would stop by the tavern to drink the cheapest bamboo sea cave wine.

Chen Sanqiu would discuss with Fan Dache the gains and losses of sword training, pointing out flaws in his sword techniques. As Fan Dache drank, he would listen intently to his friend’s advice, his eyes sparkling with determination.

Especially with Chen Ping'an suggesting that the four of them should join forces to confront the senior sword cultivator Nalan Yexing, Fan Dache was filled with excitement.

Yan Zhuo’s silk shop, besides selling over a hundred sword cultivator seals, had also released a new, bound book of Bi Jian (the Bi Sword) cultivator seals, which came with a complimentary bamboo fan. This fan bore seals not included in the Bi Jian cultivator seal book, and while the fan’s ribs and surface were made of ordinary materials, the craftsmanship lay in the poetry and seal carvings on it.

Much like how taverns pressured shops to display couplets, the various silk shops at the Sword Qi Great Wall also pressured Yan Zhuo’s shop to offer small gifts like folding fans and fragrant pouches. However, the customers—especially those wealthy women who were not lacking in personal funds—seemed unimpressed by other shops. Many women didn’t genuinely have a fondness for the seals or fans from the Yan family; they were simply compelled to shop there as several female sword cultivators, including Li Cai, frequented Yan’s shop. It appeared that not purchasing something from there would make them seem inferior, and that simply wouldn’t do.

Furthermore, some usually dull-witted gentlemen, after drinking at the tavern, seemed to have caught wind of something and would either personally visit or send servants to Yan’s shop to buy some exquisite silks, often accompanied by a fan for their women. Many women felt the gifts were overly expensive, but when they saw the anticipation in their men’s eyes, they could only utter a word of thanks.

Later, during the sweltering summer, while seeking a cool place to relax, they would open the fans, feeling the refreshing breeze and reading the beautiful lines inscribed on the surfaces. If something puzzled them, they would quietly ask others, and once they understood the meaning, they would genuinely appreciate it.

After finishing his Qi refinement, Chen Ping'an strolled alone to the Dragon Slaying Cliff pavilion under the night sky.

Ning Yao was currently in seclusion in a secret chamber. Before she entered, she had said very little, only that she wasn’t aiming to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, as there was no significant risk involved.

Chen Ping'an had to remain at the Sword Qi Great Wall for at least five years. If by then a great war still hadn’t erupted, he would need to hurry back to the Bottle Bottle Continent. After all, there were many matters back at his home in Falling Star Mountain that required immediate attention, and he would have to return to the Upside Down Mountain right after.

Currently, the cross-continental flying sword communications between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Upside Down Mountain were tightly regulated. Two checks were required for verification before any messages could be sent or received. This made things particularly troublesome for Chen Ping'an.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t carefully time a trip to the Upside Down Mountain to deliver confidential letters or family correspondence to the Guihua Island of the Fan family in Longcheng or the Shanhai Turtle of Sun Jiashu. Generally speaking, both sides maintained a decent relationship and could coordinate to send messages back to Falling Star Mountain. For Chen Ping'an, managing this task wasn’t overly difficult, though there would undoubtedly be costs involved. Otherwise, the strict oversight over flying swords at both the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Upside Down Mountain would become a great joke, as if the sword cultivators and Daoists were mere decorations.

However, Chen Ping'an wasn’t afraid of paying the necessary costs; he simply didn’t want to entangle the Fan and Sun families with too much involvement with Falling Star Mountain beyond their business dealings. It wouldn’t be fair for him, as the lord of Falling Star Mountain, to drag their good-hearted assistance into numerous complications before any profits were even shared.

Descending from Dragon Slaying Cliff, Chen Ping'an returned to his small residence. The room that had originally only housed a table for seals now had an additional table, which featured a hand-drawn map of Longquan County by Chen Ping'an. The officials from the Kiln Supervision Department would likely not be pleased upon seeing it. This map illustrated all the major and minor Longquan dragon kilns: Tian Kui Kiln, Xing Dou Kiln, Wen Chang Kiln, Wu Long Kiln, Chong Xiao Kiln, Flower Kiln, Tong Yin Kiln, Paperweight Kiln, Lingzhi Kiln, Yu Qin Kiln, and He Hua Kiln...

There were also two manuscripts on the table, both handwritten by Chen Ping'an. One recorded the historical lineage of all the dragon kiln sites, while the other traced the origins of the fourteen prominent families in the small town, all written in tiny script densely packed together. It was likely that the Huaihuang County officials and the Great Li Ministry of Justice would not be pleased upon seeing this either.

Much of this information was recalled from memory by Chen Ping'an, with a significant portion of the confidential files gathered over the past years through painstaking efforts at Falling Star Mountain.

With his hands in his sleeves, Chen Ping'an gently swayed back and forth, gazing at the map.

Without turning his head, he reached into his sleeve, using two fingers to flip open one of the manuscripts, revealing the Zhengyang Mountain section. Glancing at it, he flipped to the next page, which detailed the Xu family of Qingfeng City.

Both were old acquaintances.

Their ancestral lineages spanning eighteen generations were clearly recorded in the manuscript. It was likely that Chen Ping'an understood their respective mountains and family histories better than the direct descendants of these esteemed swordsman families.

These were two nearly completed main volumes. There would subsequently be two supplementary volumes, containing even more textual content: one concerning the sale of innate porcelain from the dragon kilns, and the prospective buyers from various celestial families and sects on the Bottle Bottle Continent. Besides the seemingly unremarkable Ma family of Xinghua Lane, there would also be the lofty Qionglin Sect, which could connect to the powerful Xu Xuan of North Ju Lu Continent, and then to He Xiaoliang, the sect leader of Qingliang Sect, thus involving the celestial family leaders of the Bottle Bottle Continent.

The other volume would elaborate on the intricate connections between the large families of the small town and the various celestial families outside of Li Zhu Cave. The two supplementary volumes would naturally interweave and connect.

As Chen Ping'an stepped out of the room, he found Nalan Yexing waiting at the door, looking somewhat grave and a bit irritated, with an unnamed disciple standing beside him: the Golden Core sword cultivator Cui Wei, who was a native of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The murderous intent from Nalan Yexing was palpable, as if he might not be able to restrain himself from killing the man on the spot.

Understanding the situation, Chen Ping'an smiled at the old man and said, “Grandpa Nalan, there’s no need to feel so guilty. When you have the time, I’d like to discuss a matter of conscience with you.”

Nalan Yexing nodded and turned to Cui Wei, saying, “From this night forward, you and I, Nalan Yexing, shall no longer share any master-disciple bond.”

Cui Wei’s expression remained indifferent as he offered an apologetic fist salute to the sword immortal.

As for Cui Wei’s true thoughts at that moment, someone who had been able to endure until now would undoubtedly show nothing.

In a flash, Nalan Yexing vanished.

Chen Ping'an brought out two chairs, and Cui Wei gently took a seat. “Mr. Chen should have guessed by now.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I had my suspicions from the start because your surname stands out far too much. Once bitten by a snake, one is afraid of a well rope for ten years. I couldn’t help but think more about it. However, after this long period of observation, my suspicions had lessened by more than half. After all, you should never have left the Sword Qi Great Wall. It’s hard to believe someone could be so patient, and I can’t understand why you would be willing to make such sacrifices. So can we say that the true mentor who led you onto the path of cultivation was Cui Zhan, who had already planted a piece in the Sword Qi Great Wall long ago?”

Cui Wei nodded, “Mr. Chen’s guess is correct. Not only me, but nearly all those who wouldn’t even admit to being spies exist, such as Huang Zhou from Dayu Ridge. The path of cultivation originated from inconspicuous accidents, without leaving any trace. Thus, we were completely kept in the dark from the start. From then on, whatever we were supposed to do, whatever we were supposed to say, all fell under extremely subtle manipulation. Eventually, one day, like me, Cui Wei, I suddenly received a command that matched a hidden signal and willingly walked into the Ning residence to reveal my identity to Mr. Chen.”

Cui Wei spoke directly, “Regarding the past, even if Mr. Chen interrogates me in detail, I won’t say a word. There’s no point in it. The first person to teach me was already dead on the southern battlefield. I came to the Ning residence today to say just one thing: from now on, any confidential letters sent to the Bottle Bottle Continent should be entrusted to me, Cui Wei. Mr. Chen can choose to believe it or not.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Of course I don’t believe you, and I won’t entrust you with any letters. But rest assured, you, Cui Wei, are of no benefit or harm to the Ning residence now. I won’t go out of my way to complicate matters. From now on, you will still be Cui Wei, but without the connection of being an unnamed disciple of Nalan Yexing.”

Cui Wei reached into his sleeve and took out a smooth pebble, handing it to Chen Ping'an without saying a word.

Chen Ping'an accepted it; it was a stone from the spring dew pool on Yuying Cliff, picked up by Cui Dongshan.

Chen Ping'an pocketed the stone and smiled, “In the future, when we meet, let’s avoid the Ning residence and try to go to the tavern instead. Of course, we should strive to see each other as little as possible to avoid raising suspicions. If I need to find you, I’ll slightly shift your ‘no troubles’ sign. Starting next month, I won’t mention my own idle drinking with friends. If I need to send or receive letters, I’ll first shift the no troubles sign, and only show up on the first day of each month to meet you. If there’s no exception, the following month, I’ll push it back to the second day. If there is an exception, I’ll notify you when we meet. Generally speaking, sending and receiving letters should be limited to twice a year. If you have a better way to communicate or any concerns regarding yourself, you can come up with a proposal and tell me later.”

“Got it.” 

Cui Wei stood up and silently left.

Chen Ping'an also got to his feet but did not see him off.

Nalan Yexing appeared under the eaves, sighing, “To know someone’s face but not their heart.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “We should be glad to have one less ‘bad possibility’ around.”

As for saying good things about Cui Wei or helping Nalan Yexing criticize him, there was no need.

Nalan Yexing could only smile bitterly, feeling a sense of loss.

Chen Ping'an led the old man to the opposite side of the house, where the elder took out two jars of wine, and it didn’t matter that there were no side dishes.

After hearing Chen Ping'an briefly recount the heart-to-heart meeting at Shujian Lake, it was unnecessary to delve into many of the details. In general, it was meant to reassure the old man that losing to Cui Zhan wasn’t surprising.

Nalan Yexing couldn’t help but drink an extra jar of wine, finally asking, “How did the son-in-law get through such a tough time?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Didn’t Grandpa Nalan already say the answer?”

Nalan Yexing was stunned for a moment before he understood, bursting into a hearty laugh.

It was the height of summer at the Sword Qi Great Wall, while on the Bottle Bottle Continent in Longquan County, the first heavy snow of winter fell.

The ancestral hall of Falling Star Mountain was not on the main peak, and there was some distance from the residence, but Chen Nuan Shu had to visit the Zise Peak ancestral hall every half month to open the door and meticulously clean it.

Today, Pei Qian and Zhou Mili were assisting Chen Nuan Shu. On the way there, Pei Qian extended her hand, and the right guardian of Falling Star Mountain respectfully presented her with a walking stick. Pei Qian, wielding her mad sword technique, shattered countless snowflakes.

Upon arriving at the outermost gate of the ancestral hall, Pei Qian stood on the steps, her sword held with both hands, surveying the surroundings. The heavy snow stretched endlessly, and with her master absent from Falling Star Mountain, she felt an overwhelming solitude, as if she were invincible in the world.

Chen Nuan Shu took out the key and opened the door, which led to a large courtyard. Further inside was the ancestral hall, which was always left open. Zhou Mili took the water bucket, took a deep breath, and unleashed her innate divine ability, sprinting wildly through the snow-laden courtyard. She vigorously shook the bucket, quickly generating a full bucket of clear water, which she held up high to hand to Chen Nuan Shu standing above.

As Chen Nuan Shu was about to cross the threshold into the ancestral hall, Pei Qian suddenly yanked her back, pulling her behind herself. Pei Qian bent slightly, gripping her walking stick, and fixed a piercing gaze on the chair placed at the front of the ancestral hall.

That chair belonged to her master.

Ripples emerged, and an old man dressed in a scholar's robe with snow-white hair appeared out of thin air.

Pei Qian stared at the small, thin old man, momentarily entranced.

The lights of the world were like countless stars in the galaxy.

This was a realm she had never encountered before, boundless and infinite; no matter how hard she squinted to see, the scenery seemed endless.

The old scholar stood beside the chair, looking at the much taller girl outside the door, filled with much sentiment.

It was worth it to risk his old face, borrowing things from others and making bets.

After all, it was his own direct disciple who had never let her master or senior brother down.

“Is that you, Old Sage of Literature?” Pei Qian asked.

The old scholar was momentarily taken aback, having never been addressed in such a way. He curiously asked, “Why ‘Old Sage of Literature’?”

Pei Qian replied earnestly, “To make your generation seem even higher.”

The old scholar chuckled, stroking his beard, and nodded, “That is indeed kind.”

This particular branch of knowledge, which could only be understood and not transmitted, had been so quickly propagated? 

Pei Qian glanced at the hanging portrait at the top, withdrew her gaze, and said loudly, “Old Sage of Literature, you seem more dignified than the portrait!”

Chen Nuan Shu blinked but said nothing.

Zhou Mili tilted her head, furrowing her brows as she glanced between the portrait and the old scholar. She really couldn’t see the resemblance.

The old scholar coughed a few times, adjusted his collar, straightened his back, and asked, “Is that true?”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, craning her neck and shaking her head side to side, looking here and there, then finally replied, “Absolutely! Even the big white goose praises my ability to see people!”

The old scholar laughed, unable to contain his joy, and gestured for the three young girls to sit down. They already had chairs there anyway. The old scholar lowered his voice and said, “You three girls knowing of my visit to Falling Star Mountain is enough. Be sure not to mention it to anyone else.”

Pei Qian cleared her throat, “Nuan Shu, Mili!”

Chen Nuan Shu nodded, “Understood.”

Zhou Mili, holding onto the walking stick bestowed by Pei Qian, puffed out her chest and tightly closed her mouth.

From now on, she would act as a mute. Besides, she was originally a water monster from Mute Lake.

The old scholar strolled slowly within the ancestral hall, while Chen Nuan Shu began familiarizing herself with cleaning the chairs. Pei Qian stood beside her chair, and when Zhou Mili attempted to sit in the chair marked with a paper note from the right guardian, she was shot a glare by Pei Qian. Without any decorum, how could she sit down when the old gentleman hadn’t even taken a seat? Zhou Mili immediately stood straight, feeling a bit wronged. She just wanted that old gentleman to understand who she truly was.

The old scholar noticed this and smiled, saying nothing.

He had put in a significant amount of effort to guide Pei Qian to the path she was on today, and the care he had for his closed-door disciple was considerable. Teaching so well was even more commendable.

This was actually the old scholar’s third visit to Falling Star Mountain. In his previous two visits, he had come and gone in a hurry and hadn’t set foot in this place. After this visit, he would be busy again, facing hard work.

Previously, he had secretly visited a small town school and stood in a certain position.

Looking back over the years, there should have been a girl in a red cotton jacket, sitting straight and appearing to listen intently, but her mind was wandering far away.

There would be a focused Lin Shouyi, who would think of anything the teacher mentioned.

There would be Li Huai, dozing off like a little chick pecking rice.

There would be Zhao Yao, who at that time couldn’t have imagined that one day he would leave his master’s side and travel afar by ox cart, eventually journeying alone to the Central Divine Continent.

There would be the seemingly foolish but wise Dong Shui Jing, a little girl with her hair tied in two horns.

At that time, the old man stood there, thinking of a disciple named Ma Zhan, who had taken one wrong step after another, and after realizing it, had a chance for repentance but opted to die instead.

In the end, the old man found that all the mistakes seemed to stem from himself. As a teacher responsible for imparting knowledge and resolving confusion, he hadn’t taught enough. He had failed to adequately provide his disciples with the means to stand firm in their lives.

The old scholar couldn't help but feel a deep sense of guilt.

At that time, in the school, the old man turned to look outside, as if there were a pale and thin child standing on tiptoe by the window, with wide eyes and perked ears, listening to the sounds of reading and smelling the fragrance of books, gazing at the teacher and students inside. The lonely child stood outside the school, his clean eyes filled with hope.

In that child’s future, he might carry a large basket while foraging for herbs on the mountain, summoning his courage to shout the unfamiliar phrase, “At the beginning of man, nature is inherently good.” On his way down the mountain, he would joyfully recite, “Heaven and earth are dark and yellow, and the universe is boundless.” Between going up and down the mountain, under the blazing sun, drenched in sweat, the child would rest in the shade of a tree, playing with grass, winning and losing all by himself, raising a hand to shout, “I won, I won,” displaying a hint of childish innocence.

The world is filled with suffering, and such a life for a child is not uncommon.

However, it was rare for a child so young to endure it all alone.

The old scholar even regretted having said those words to Chen Ping'an; the young man’s shoulders should carry the willows and the grass, along with the songs of the oriole.

With Pei Qian and the others, there was no issue, but saying this to Chen Ping'an—wasn’t that standing in comfort and criticizing from the sidelines?

Yet, the old scholar thought again, looking at the current Falling Star Mountain; it seemed that speaking such words to that grass shoe boy back in the day was the right thing to do.

Finally, Pei Qian and the others noticed that the old gentleman who had come from afar was sitting in the chair closest to the threshold, quietly gazing up at the three hanging portraits.

He avoided looking at his own portrait in the center, instead gazing for a long time at the portrait of Cui Cheng, nodding gently as he murmured words that no one could quite hear. Ultimately, the old gentleman continued to look at the portrait of his disciple, remaining silent.

The old man muttered to himself, “One might ask: ‘How to repay virtue for malice?’”

He answered himself, “The Master said: ‘How to repay virtue? Repay malice with justice, and virtue with virtue.’”

A cross-continental ferry boat from the Bottle Bottle Continent, Guihua Island, disembarked a pair of sword cultivator master and disciple from the North Ju Lu Continent.

The green-clad sword immortal who was the master likely still didn’t realize that he had gained a bit of a reputation in the many alleys of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

(End of this chapter)

 ### Chapter 702: The Ten Sword Immortals at the Peak of the Sword Qi Great Wall

Fan Dache was sitting in a tavern today, his body covered in small wounds, lost in thought as he sipped his drink. 

Chen Sanqiu was not faring much better, having sustained numerous injuries as well. The five of them had promised to work together to surround and kill the Sword Immortal Nalan Yexing in the miniature world of the Ning family's martial arts arena. However, apart from Chen Ping'an, Chen Sanqiu, Yan Zhuo, Dong Huafu, and the least capable, Fan Dache, none of them ended up with a good outcome; they all suffered injuries of varying degrees.

Yan the Fat returned home to continue practicing his swordsmanship, while Dong Heitan wandered off aimlessly, eating and drinking, buying this and that, with all the costs attributed to Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo.

Fan Dache sighed, "Sanqiu, I suddenly feel a bit scared about becoming a Golden Elixir Sword Cultivator. Once I become one, I won’t have a swordmaster by my side." 

Chen Sanqiu chuckled, "Well, I’m in a better position than you. I was born into a good family, wealthy and well-connected. Even if I become a Golden Elixir, I’ll still have my family’s swordmaster to help protect me. I'm happy, truly happy. Let me drink to that!" 

True to his word, Chen Sanqiu raised his cup and took a sip. 

He realized that with a friend as sensitive as Fan Dache, being direct was often better than trying to sugarcoat things or overly consider the other person’s feelings. 

Fan Dache laughed in return, saying, "Since Chen Ping'an promised that during the next great battle, he would follow us off the city wall, then he is, by default, my swordmaster."

After so many sparring sessions, even a fool like Fan Dache could see Chen Ping'an's intentions. He wanted to help Fan Dache refine his cultivation and also ensure that everyone could cooperate smoothly, striving for everyone to survive in the next battle while maximizing their kill count against the monsters.

Chen Sanqiu raised his cup, clinking it with Fan Dache’s, "Then you, Fan Dache, are remarkable to have such treatment to have Chen Ping'an as your swordmaster."

Fan Dache filled another cup, wiping his mouth. "Thinking about it this way, I’m more willing to become a Golden Elixir Sword Cultivator."

He lowered his voice and said, “Chen Ping'an is already a fifth realm cultivator now, and just so happens to have broken through at our Sword Qi Great Wall. Why isn’t he here in the tavern celebrating?”

Chen Sanqiu laughed, "He probably feels it’s not appropriate to boast, especially since he hasn’t reached the Cave Dwelling stage yet."

Fan Dache shook his head. "What is there to feel inappropriate about?"

Earlier, when they were drinking, Chen Ping'an stood up to toast all the guests, speaking earnestly, "Sword Immortals, why haven’t you all broken through yet? Don’t be polite with me! What’s there to be polite about? Drinking the cheapest wine from our Sword Qi Great Wall, eating the best Yangchun noodles, and enjoying free pickled vegetables, yet still delaying your breakthroughs? That’s like squatting over a latrine without doing your business! Don’t you feel guilty about the wine we serve here, or the couplets and the horizontal scrolls of the tavern? If you don’t shape up soon, every time a single man comes here to drink, we'll charge extra!"

All the patrons were left dumbfounded, feeling something was off, but in the end, they couldn’t quite grasp it. For example, that phrase about squatting over a latrine without doing your business, they felt they were the ones at a disadvantage.

What truly drove people to curse was the betting on Dong Huafu taking the initiative to spend money. Gamblers, big and small, didn’t win much at all. Initially, everyone was rather pleased, thinking that the deputy storekeeper and that plump kid from the Yan family were losing a lot. Later, the only one who won a substantial amount was Pang Yuanji, who came to the tavern smiling and drinking, causing others to gradually realize the truth, especially with that old Nascent Soul rogue who inexplicably wrote a poem earlier.

Damn it, that was familiar territory!

So today, Chen Ping'an didn’t follow Chen Sanqiu and Fan Dache to the tavern but instead made a trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

On the way, after dividing the spoils, Chen Ping'an, who had earned several Grain Rain coins, thought it was time to change the dealer for the next betting round. For instance, Sword Immortal Tao Wen looked quite reliable.

On the city wall, Chen Ping'an did not directly ride the talisman boat to his senior brother but took a detour of over a hundred miles.

Along the way, he encountered a group of young sword cultivators at the fifth realm, practicing their swordsmanship under the guidance of a Nascent Soul sword cultivator.

Watching this kind of practice was not forbidden.

Chen Ping'an sat on the city wall, observing from a distance. Nearby, seven or eight little children were arguing, debating how many Lin Junbis could take on a deputy storekeeper.

Kids who could come up to the city wall were not simple; they were either rich or talented in swordsmanship. 

Children from places like Yan Chi Alley or Lingxi Alley wouldn’t come here; the city was too far from the Sword Qi Great Wall, and ordinary city kids wouldn’t have the stamina. Furthermore, above the city wall, the sword intent was heavy, and the sword qi was dense; physically weak children simply couldn’t endure this kind of torment. Such is life—some people swim easily in water from a young age, while others find it increasingly difficult as they grow.

One child spotted Chen Ping'an sitting nearby and shouted, “Deputy Storekeeper, tell us, can you beat five Lin Junbis with one hand? If you nod, I’ll be your friend in the future!”

Chen Ping'an didn’t turn around but just waved his hand dismissively, signaling him to go away.

That kid, whose name had some significance, wasn’t willing to give up and persisted, “What about three? Three should be possible, right?!”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I’ve never fought them, so I wouldn’t know.”

The child shouted, “Then should I write a challenge? Just say the deputy storekeeper plans to use one hand to challenge all of them, including Lin Junbi, Yan Lu, and Jiang Guanzheng!”

Chen Ping'an stood up, walked over to the kid with her hands on her hips, hesitated for a moment, and realized she was just a little tomboy. He gently pinched her head, gave it a light twist, and kicked her behind, “Get lost. Do you even know how to write? Writing a challenge?”

After steadying herself, the girl, Yuanzhao, huffed, “I know plenty of words! Way more than you!”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Can you write ‘talking big without preparation’?”

Yuanzhao replied, “I can, but I won’t! Actually, it’s you who doesn’t know how to write. You want me to teach you, huh? Dream on!”

She was clearly a leader among the kids, and the others rallied behind her, agreeing with her.

Chen Ping'an sat back down, facing the northern city, twisting his wrist to pull out a piece of bamboo leaf and began to play a tune.

Yuanzhao listened but shrugged, “Not that great.”

The other children could only peck at the ground in agreement.

Seeing that Chen Ping'an wasn’t engaging with her, Yuanzhao felt a bit disappointed. She simply clapped her knees softly and gazed northward, where the city lay, a mirage bustling with trade and commotion.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an asked with a smile, “Who do you think are the ten most powerful Sword Immortals nowadays? No need for any order.”

Yuanzhao rolled her eyes, “If there’s no order, what’s the point? You can just guess on your own.”

Chen Ping'an was about to get up and practice when Yuanzhao stretched out her hand, “If you give me a folding fan, I’ll spill some secrets.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “You have quite the scheme there.”

Yuanzhao spread her arms, blocking Chen Ping'an’s way, her eyes stubborn, “Hurry up! It has to be the one with the most characters written beautifully!”

Chen Ping'an originally didn’t want to indulge her but suddenly recalled something and sat back down, “You go first, and I’ll decide based on my mood.”

Yuanzhao began to rattle off, “First is Sword Immortal Dong Sangu, then A Liang, Master Yin, Chen Xi, Qi Tingji, Zuo You, Nalan Shaowei, Old Deaf, and Lu Zhi. That’s the ten! Now, where’s my folding fan?!”

Chen Ping'an stood up and actually selected a jade bamboo folding fan from his belongings, slapping it into the hands of the little girl, “Remember to take care of it; it’s worth a lot of celestial coins.”

Yuanzhao opened the fan, quite pleased, but there weren’t many characters on it, and she couldn’t recognize most of them, so she angrily said, “Trade it for another! I want one with more words!”

Chen Ping'an pressed down on her head again, gently twisted it to the side, and laughed, “You little girl still dare to bargain with me? Know when to stop; otherwise, be careful I take it back.”

Yuanzhao clutched the fan she had just received and moved it behind her, extending her other hand, “Then I want to buy another fan with the most words!”

Chen Ping'an laughed and asked, “And where’s the money?”

Yuanzhao replied seriously, “Dong Sangu, A Liang, Master Yin, Chen Xi, Qi Tingji, Zuo You, Nalan Shaowei, Old Deaf, Lu Zhi. From today on, I’ll add you, the deputy storekeeper Chen Ping'an! That makes us the eleven strongest Sword Immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall!”

Chen Ping'an burst into laughter, “You’re quite something. You’re the first to successfully swindle money from me at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Yuanzhao didn’t care much for such a “title.” At this moment, she had two folding fans in hand and was ecstatic. She suddenly spoke in a bargaining tone, lowering her voice, “If you give me another one, it doesn’t need to have too many characters, and I can rank you in the top ten, even the top five!”

Unfortunately, the silly deputy storekeeper just smiled and walked away.

Before he left, he took out a small stamp, blew on it, had Yuanzhao hand over the fan with fewer characters, stamped it lightly, and then returned it to the little girl.

The other kids looked at each other in confusion.

The elder Nascent Soul sword cultivator finished his lessons and, after Chen Ping'an left, approached the group of children nearby. 

Yuanzhao was leaning over the wall, spreading out both folding fans, diligently trying to decipher the characters. She obviously preferred the one filled with characters, feeling it was more valuable.

The old man bent down to examine the less character-filled fan, chuckling softly.

Most good things don’t last, and splendid clouds dissipate easily like fragile glass. 

The phrase about clouds dissipating can return, but a heart, like shattered glass, remains broken.

The first part was a famous line from the Haoran world. The latter part, however, was a muddled continuation, completely off base and should have been a random creation from that young man.

Still, the sentiment was good, shifting from despair to hope, indicating some effort was made, and nothing more.

The old sword cultivator exclaimed softly, squatting down to gaze at the somewhat inconspicuous vermilion seal, laughing as he found it interesting.

The seal read, “In the human world, many part ways; a broken mirror can also reunite.”

Thinking of Yuanzhao’s background, her father, who once had a chance to reach the fifth realm, died in battle in the south, leaving only mother and daughter to rely on each other. The old sword cultivator looked up, glancing at the distant figure of the young man.

Regardless, he was different from those scholars from the academies.

It wasn't that they didn't want to do something, but almost all of them ended up facing walls every step of the way, naturally becoming disheartened and returning to the Haoran world.

Chen Ping'an arrived at Zuo You’s side.

“Did you break through so quickly?” Zuo You asked.

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’m now a fifth realm Qi Practitioner.”

Zuo You said, “In studying and cultivating one’s heart, one must not be negligent.”

Perhaps only someone like Zuo You would worry about his junior brother breaking through too quickly instead of being concerned about his low realm.

Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, “With you watching over me, even if I wanted to slack off, I wouldn’t dare.”

Zuo You sneered, “Why not say, ‘Even if I want to die a few more times under the sword qi, I still can’t slack off?’”

Chen Ping'an knew he was in for a rough time during this sword training.

On the Guohua Island ferry, Guohua Xiaoniang Jin Su, the only direct disciple of Lady Gui, had not changed her realm in ten years, stuck at a bottleneck. This time, the ferry was stopping at the Upside-Down Mountain so that Lady Gui could let her relax a bit. The mountain and sea were interdependent, a unique feng shui location. Furthermore, Lady Gui had given Jin Su a Grain Rain coin as pocket money and playfully told her not to hesitate when she saw her beloved items she had longed for nearly twenty years.

That startled Jin Su, who wanted to refuse, but Lady Gui waved her hand, reminding her that Mr. Qi and his disciple were both visiting Upside-Down Mountain for the first time, so she should do her best to assist them.

Jin Su didn't think much of it.

Qi Jinglong and his disciple Baishou didn’t mention their sect, so Jin Su assumed they were just Confucian students traveling for learning.

North Julu Island was famous for its sword cultivators, yet both of them were unarmed.

This time, they traveled from Guohua Island to Upside-Down Mountain, staying in the Guimai Courtyard that had long been under Chen Ping'an's name, as they had heard it was Chen Ping'an’s friend. Jin Su had little contact with Qi Jinglong and his disciple, occasionally accompanying Lady Gui to the small courtyard for tea and such. Jin Su only knew that Qi Jinglong came from North Julu Island, traveling south aboard a ferry from the Peima sect, stopping midway in Longquan County of Da Li, and arrived at Old Dragon City just in time for Guohua Island to head to Upside-Down Mountain, staying in the Guimai Courtyard which had been vacant for a long time.

Lady Gui didn’t mention anything about his cultivation level, and Jin Su didn’t bother asking about his background, viewing him as an ordinary ferry passenger she wouldn’t meet again.

What did it matter what his family background was, what his realm was, or what kind of person he was to her, Jin Su thought?

But she didn’t dare to neglect what her master had instructed. Guohua Island’s docking point was still near the Catch-and-Release Pavilion. She introduced the origins of the pavilion to Qi Jinglong, but unexpectedly, that oddly named young boy lost interest after seeing the plaque written by the second Daoist elder, and instead, Qi Jinglong insisted on visiting the nearby pavilion. Jin Su didn’t mind, but the boy, Baishou, was noticeably impatient. Only Qi Jinglong leisurely pushed through the crowd, stopping for a long time in the bustling Catch-and-Release Pavilion, and eventually left the least interesting small pavilion among the eight scenic spots at Upside-Down Mountain, looking up at the plaque as if he could discern some secrets from it. This made Jin Su a bit displeased; such pretentiousness was inferior to Chen Ping'an from back in the day.

Fortunately, Jin Su was a rather reserved girl, so her expression didn’t reveal much.

Moreover, since she stood with a few close friends from Guohua, she thought of the Grain Rain coin she had carefully hidden and smiled.

The boy, Baishou, was straightforward to the point of being dense, complaining loudly about “that Liu guy” hindering him from reaching the Thunder Marsh Platform. 

He didn’t refer to Qi Jinglong as “master” or “Mr. Qi,” but always called him “that Liu guy,” which was rather strange.

Bringing along such a disrespectful and ungrateful disciple on a journey, Jin Su found Qi Jinglong even stranger.

After leaving the crowd at the Catch-and-Release Pavilion, Jin Su asked if Mr. Qi had a preferred inn. The Lingzhi Inn had the best view but was expensive, so many regulars from Guohua Island typically stayed at the Stork and Sparrow Inn, where Chen Ping'an had stayed before. However, that inn was small, located in a remote alley, not very noticeable, and not particularly high-quality, but the prices were affordable. Qi Jinglong smiled and asked Jin Su to lead them to the Stork and Sparrow Inn.

Baishou immediately objected, ready to shout, but at a glance from Qi Jinglong, he swallowed his words and only dared to mumble under his breath.

The group arrived at the indeed hidden Stork and Sparrow Inn, where Baishou stared at the smiling young shopkeeper, feeling like he was being led into a pigsty for slaughter. After sitting down with “that Liu guy,” Baishou began to complain, “Why do we, sword cultivators from North Julu Island, stay in this little shabby place instead of the Spring Banner Studio, one of the four private residences of Upside-Down Mountain? What’s wrong with that? What, are you after the beauty of those Guohua girls?”

Qi Jinglong poured two cups of tea, and Baishou drank one in a single gulp, continuing his grumbling, “Even the prettiest Jin Su isn’t as good as the infatuated Lu Fairy, right? Oh, by the way, the owner of Spring Banner Studio is said to have almost become a divine couple with the master of the Lu Fairy’s ancestor. You’re worried someone will tip her off and block your path here at Upside-Down Mountain? No way, that Lu Fairy isn’t like that Sun family head from the Colorful Sparrow Court. But I’ll say, among the girls who like you, Lu Sui has the best looks, and I like Sun Qing’s personality the most. She’s open and frank but with a touch of subtlety, while the girl from Sanlang Temple is way too forward; her eyes are fierce, and when she sees you, it’s like a drunkard spotting a good drink. Just looking at you two, I can tell there’s no future there; you’re simply not on the same wavelength.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “When we return to Taihui Sword Sect, should we make a trip back to Longquan County’s Po Luo Mountain?”

Baishou immediately shut up, pretending to be deaf and mute, still feeling uneasy. He stubbornly poured tea for Qi Jinglong with a polite demeanor.

Thinking about that black-hearted and cunning Heitan, Baishou felt a shiver run down his spine. 

Who would have thought that the dignified Baishou Sword Immortal would embark on his first journey only to find his reputation tarnished before he had even made a name for himself! 

Forget Po Luo Mountain, I’m never going back there again.

Damn Chen Ping'an for teaching such a good disciple!

Baishou felt he was fated to be incompatible with Po Luo Mountain; the name alone was ominous. No way, no way!

Qi Jinglong was reminded of some personal matters, feeling a bit helpless and melancholy.

This time, leaving North Julu Island was partly because Qi Jinglong had nothing pressing to attend to, having successfully taken on the sword challenges from three Sword Immortals of Taihui Sword Sect. He wanted to explore the remaining eight continents of the Haoran world. Furthermore, there was a secret directive from his master, Huang Tong, saying the sect leader wanted to see him urgently about something.

Qi Jinglong was well aware of the sect leader’s intentions; they were keen on making him the next sect leader during the relatively peaceful interval between battles. At least for the next hundred years, he wouldn’t have to worry about participating in the monster-slaying defense of the Sword Qi Great Wall purely as a new Sword Immortal from North Julu Island.

All other matters of Taihui Sword Sect could be entrusted to Han Huaizi alone.

Baishou dared not continue discussing matters of romance and tactfully changed the subject, “Can’t we stay at the Spring Banner Studio? I really want to see that gourd vine. On the mountain, I promised several junior brothers and disciples I’d check out those future sword nurturing gourds. If I can’t see them, I’ll have no face to return to Taihui Sword Sect. Am I supposed to hide out at Pianran Peak? It’s embarrassing, and in the end, isn’t it you who’s causing me to lose face?”

Spring Banner Studio was one of the four private residences of Upside-Down Mountain.

The most famous one was naturally the Monkey Rubbing Mansion of Lord Liu, built purely from celestial coins to create mountains of gold and silver. The story of Lord Liu’s grievances with the Daoist deity is widely known and often laughed about.

The Plum Blossom Garden, built by a sect cultivator from Central Earth, was said to house a five-realm spirit charm who had lived for who knows how long. Back then, the owner hired an entire ferry to transport a family plum tree to Upside-Down Mountain, costing a fortune.

Spring Banner Studio was built by a down-and-out sword immortal from North Julu Island, frequently hosting sword cultivators from his hometown, yet the studio’s master never showed his face.

The last one, Water Crystal Mansion, was a seaside sect’s villa. It was rumored that in recent years, they had leveraged the remnants of the Dragon River and their sect’s fame had skyrocketed.

Figures like the sect leader of Taihui Sword Sect, Han Huaizi, the head of the ancestral hall, Huang Tong, and the upcoming visitor to Upside-Down Mountain, Fu Ping Jianhu, had all stayed at Spring Banner Studio. The studio was home to a gourd vine that had been cultivated over generations by enlightened immortals. It had been nurtured with spiritual energy for over a thousand years, producing fourteen gourds that had the potential to become sword-nurturing gourds. If successfully refined, they would all start as magical treasures, with the best among them rumored to become half-immortal weapons.

Even if the magical treasures or half-immortal weapons were of the same rank, there could be a significant difference in quality. 

A sword-nurturing gourd that was a half-immortal weapon could almost rival the legendary sword-nurturing gourd left behind by the Dao Ancestor, thus it should be regarded as a celestial weapon.

That sword immortal from North Julu Island had left his hometown, bringing the gourd vine here to take root. Spring Banner Studio, sheltered by Upside-Down Mountain, was a wise move, unaffected by external disturbances.

However, even if fourteen gourds had yet to fully mature, successfully refining even half into sword-nurturing gourds would be quite impressive, making Spring Banner Studio famous, bringing in a fortune, and most importantly, securing relationships with at least seven sword immortals. Perhaps with these ties, the owner of Spring Banner Studio could even establish a sect anywhere in the Haoran world, becoming a founder.

That’s why Baishou was so eager for Spring Banner Studio.

Moreover, Chen Ping'an’s vermillion wine flask was rumored to be a legendary sword-nurturing gourd that had made the young boy incredibly envious back at Pianran Peak.

If only he could be like Brother Chen, using a sword-nurturing gourd for wine, it would give him more face in the martial world.

However, Brother Chen was a bit too shy, as he hadn’t engraved the words “Sword-Nurturing Gourd” on that wine flask.

Qi Jinglong nodded, “We’ll go there after visiting the other seven scenic spots. Nowadays, it’s quite difficult for outsiders to travel from Upside-Down Mountain to the Sword Qi Great Wall; we need Spring Banner Studio to help us with connections and guarantees.”

Hearing that there was a chance, Baishou, who had been feeling disheartened, perked up, saying, “Can you help me reserve a sword-nurturing gourd from Spring Banner Studio? I don’t ask for much, just the lowest-ranked one, considered as your acceptance gift for me? Taihui Sword Sect is such a large sect; you, being a Jade Purity realm sword cultivator, shouldn’t let the acceptance gift be lacking. Just look at my Brother Chen; after the ancestral hall was established at Po Luo Mountain, he gifted valuable items left and right. Isn’t each one worth a fortune? Liu, you better learn a thing or two from Brother Chen!”

In truth, the boy was just rambling, not really expecting Qi Jinglong to agree. Sword-nurturing gourds, especially high-ranked ones, were treasures so rare that even sword immortals might not possess them. 

For sword cultivators, having a low-ranked sword-nurturing gourd could hinder the nurturing of their life sword; thus, a sword-nurturing gourd that could attract the attention of sword immortals was incredibly hard to come by.

However, Baishou never expected that the man leisurely sipping tea would nod and say, “I’ll try to put in a word. Whether it works out or not, I won’t guarantee anything. If you take my words too seriously and set your expectations too high, ending up disappointed and blaming me when I notice something wrong, then that would mean my teachings were flawed, and we’ll both have to reflect on it together.”

For the first time, Baishou didn’t find himself annoyed by Liu’s incessant chattering. He was overjoyed and exclaimed, “You really want to put in a word for me?”

Liu’s “quirks” were well-known, but he had one redeeming quality: he always kept his word.

Qi Jinglong replied, “In the ancestral hall, you become my disciple, and as a teacher, I should gift my disciple an acceptance gift. You’re a direct disciple of the Taihui Sword Sect’s ancestral hall, possessing a fine sword-nurturing gourd would benefit your path, allowing you to cultivate faster and have more time to refine your heart. Why would I hesitate to make the request? I’m not forcing Spring Banner Studio to sell me a sword-nurturing gourd.”

Baishou paused, muttering, “I’m just not seeing you carrying any money when you leave; you don’t seem like a generous person.”

Qi Jinglong laughed, “Generosity isn’t solely measured by wealth. Beyond the literal meaning, it’s primarily about the ‘only’ aspect. Extreme views in this world usually don’t lead to anything good. I’m not making excuses for myself; I want you to consider others outside of me when dealing with matters. This way, you’ll avoid missing out on friends you shouldn’t lose and forming friendships with those you shouldn’t be close to.”

Baishou questioned, “Are you aware that Spring Banner Studio won’t sell you a sword-nurturing gourd, and this is just your opportunity to impart some of these profound principles?”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “For cultivators, especially those with a path, time flows endlessly. As long as one is willing to open their eyes, how many times can they witness the truth behind things? How you perceive my sincerity is up to you. I can tell you, but will you believe me?”

Baishou covered his head with both hands, wailing, “My head hurts. I’m not listening, not listening; it’s just you rambling!”

The boy had indeed picked up quite a few local sayings at Po Luo Mountain.

Qi Jinglong wasn’t angry, chuckling as he sipped his tea.

Suddenly, Baishou asked, “Liu, are we going to follow Jin Su and the others shopping in the future? How boring. These older sisters shop tirelessly, even more so than we do in our training, and I’m scared.”

Qi Jinglong replied, “The ferry from Old Dragon City is just docking at Upside-Down Mountain. Lady Gui should be worried about them while they’re out shopping, fearing accidents. The children of the Fu family are notorious for being unruly, believing their family laws are the city’s rules, which we’ve seen firsthand in Old Dragon City. This time, we’re staying in Guimai Courtyard, traveling across the sea, and we haven’t spent a penny. We should at least show our gratitude.”

Baishou crossed his arms, saying, “In that case, I’ll just accompany the sisters more. If any of the Fu family members try to cause trouble, don’t blame me for showing my sword immortal demeanor!”

Qi Jinglong laughed and asked, “What do you mean by ‘sword immortal demeanor’?”

Before the ferry from Peima Sect docked at Niu Horn Mountain, the boy was still brimming with confidence. Later, when he reached the top of Po Luo Mountain’s steps, he came across a row of three small heads nibbling on melon seeds, still feeling secure in his combat prowess.

Baishou, feeling both embarrassed and angry, yelled, “Liu, am I really your disciple?!”

At this point, he felt a bit downcast.

That black-hearted girl who spoke nonsense and could drive people mad was actually the first disciple of Chen Ping'an. 

Baishou himself was, after all, the only direct disciple of Liu.

Now, Chen Ping'an was at the Qi Practitioner realm, still far below Liu, yet he had suffered so miserably at Po Luo Mountain; he felt he had dragged Liu down with him.

Qi Jinglong spoke softly, “I don’t think my disciple is inferior to anyone.”

Baishou blushed and retorted angrily, “Liu, don’t get too full of yourself! I’m not being sincere about treating you as my master!”

Qi Jinglong replied seriously, “Competing with others is always about winning or losing, but competing with oneself is only about winning more or less. So, how should we choose, Baishou? What do you think?”

The boy leaned on the table, sighing deeply, genuinely envying that black-hearted girl, whose master was always out and about, not constantly nagging her.

But that wasn’t the worst of it.

The most terrifying thing was that girl, Heitan, seemed so glad to leave, saying she might also visit the Sword Qi Great Wall to see her master, depending on when her teacher would depart. She didn’t care whether Baishou wanted to go or not; she directly made the decision for them, stating they would only engage in literary contests this time, not martial ones.

Thinking of this, Baishou felt a surge of anger.

Ning Yao was still in seclusion.

Meanwhile, Chen Ping'an, aside from refining his qi, was sparring fiercely against Nalan Yexing in the martial arts arena.

Without Fan Dache and the others present, Chen Ping'an, fully committed to his punches and sword strikes, was a completely different sight within the miniature world.

Baimao had grown accustomed to watching from the pavilion, feeling that her son-in-law was undoubtedly the most handsome young man at the Sword Qi Great Wall, and an extraordinary talent not seen in a hundred years. As for his cultivation, there was no rush; he clearly seemed like someone who would make a late but strong entry. After all, wasn’t he already a fifth realm Qi Practitioner? His aptitude for cultivation wasn’t much worse than her own daughter’s.

That day, not far from the tavern, Chen Ping'an sat on a small stool, munching on melon seeds, finally finishing a story about the wine-loving Sword Immortal Qi.

Feng Kangle felt somewhat unsatisfied and asked Chen Ping'an if there were any other legendary tales about this old sword immortal. Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and figured he could make up a few more, so he said there was indeed more—stories galore! He started, recounting how the young sword immortal came to a desolate old temple one night, lit a bonfire, and, just as he was about to enjoy a drink, he encountered a few graceful women wafting in with fragrant scents, laughter, and fluttering garments. 

Upon seeing them, the young sword immortal frowned, as being a cultivator, he focused his mind, used his divine senses, and noticed the fox tails trailing behind the women. So, the young sword immortal downed a jug of wine and slowly stood up.

At this point, Chen Ping'an abruptly stopped, adding the most annoying cliffhanger, “Stay tuned for the next installment!”

Despite not drinking at the tavern, Chen Ping'an mainly felt it was because Fan Dache and the others weren’t there. The other gamblers now looked at him with unkind eyes, making it difficult to scrounge a bowl or half-bowl of wine. There was no reason for this; after all, he was the one selling wine to them, not someone in debt to them. 

Chen Ping'an squatted by the roadside, enjoying a bowl of Yangchun noodles, but suddenly felt a pang of guilt toward Qi Jinglong. The story didn’t seem riveting enough; despite his best effort, he knew he wasn’t a true storyteller.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 703: Someone Wants to Ask Chen Ping'an About His Fist Techniques**

Chen Ping'an wasn't really a heavy drinker; he just felt it was a bit ridiculous that he couldn't manage to snag even half a bowl of wine while selling it on his own turf. Was it really just about half a bowl or a full bowl? 

So, with a bit of effort, Chen Ping'an managed to turn his two familiar sword cultivators—who were drinking, eating noodles, and glaring at him—into his drinking buddies. As a price for consuming the wine, he hinted to both parties that the next time some bastard ran a shady gambling den, he, as the second shopkeeper, could lead everyone to make some money. In the end, the two sword cultivators insisted on buying Chen Ping'an drinks, and not just the cheapest Bamboo Sea Cave wine. They were determined to pool their funds to buy a pot of the five Snowflake Coins variety, arguing that if the second shopkeeper didn't drink, it meant he was snubbing them and looking down on his friends.

Chen Ping'an set down his chopsticks, quietly waiting for someone to bring over wine, feeling a bit lonely. With so many friends around, it was hard not to drink.

Earlier, on the city wall, the so-called fake youth Yuan Zao Hua had mentioned the ten sword immortals who could unleash the most formidable killing power on the Sword Qi Great Wall, and Chen Ping'an found that his own choices were quite similar.

The top sword immortals included Dong Sangeng, A Liang, Lord Hidden Official, Chen Xi, Qi Tingji, Zuo You, Nalan Shaowei, Old Deaf, and Lu Zhi.

As for Chen Qingdu, whenever he unleashed his sword, the extent of his killing power had never been precisely defined, often only existing in the romanticized words and imaginations of generations of children.

The incident where Dong Guangu made a pact with the demon clan and was personally slain by the top sword immortal had cost the Dong family some of their vitality on the Sword Qi Great Wall. Dong Sangeng had seemingly been absent for these past years, with the last occasion being when he sent off the sword immortal Huang Tong from the Taihui Sword Sect with a drinking party, which was quite an exception.

A Liang was already no longer on the Sword Qi Great Wall; he wore a bamboo hat and carried a bamboo sword. Later, he tricked a donkey from the Wei and Jin dynasties and obtained a silver-white sword-raising gourd, then met a young boy in straw sandals, who was accompanied by a little girl in a red cotton jacket.

Lord Hidden Official's battle prowess was evident, but the only question was how high his peak power truly was. No one had yet seen his life sword, neither at Ning's residence nor at the tavern; at least, Chen Ping'an had never heard of it. Even when patrons mentioned Lord Hidden Official, those who paid attention would notice he seemed to be the least sword-like amongst the sword immortals on the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Xi was the current head of the Chen family, yet he could never hold his head high in front of the top sword immortal. Even though the character "Chen" was inscribed by Chen Xi himself, in front of Chen Qingdu, he still seemed like a child who had yet to grow up. Thus, the Chen family disciples were among the least fond of visiting the city wall compared to other prominent families.

Qi Tingji was the "young" sword immortal Chen Ping'an had observed during his first visit to the Sword Qi Great Wall while practicing boxing on the city wall, and he was the head of the Qi family.

Zuo You, his senior brother, needed no further elaboration.

Nalan Shaowei had been in seclusion for a long time. The Nalan family was a significant family on the Sword Qi Great Wall, but Nalan Shaowei had been absent for so long that the Nalan family appeared slightly quiet. As for whether Nalan Yexing was part of the Nalan family, Chen Ping'an had never asked and wouldn't go out of his way to investigate. In life, one can question many things, but there must be a few people and matters that are simply beyond doubt in one's heart.

Old Deaf was indeed that old sword cultivator rumored to come from the demon clan, and he managed the prison that held many large demons.

Lu Zhi had almost been forgotten for her identity as a wild cultivator from the Haoran world, but upon reaching the Golden Core realm, she came to the Sword Qi Great Wall, gradually breaking through and achieving remarkable military exploits.

Every time the city was defended, it was a desperate fight.

A Liang had once invited her for a drink and made a playful remark that somehow spread, considering they were just two people drinking together.

"Those who live in isolation are either beasts or gods."

Dong couldn't help but think that the person he admired most was Lu Zhi.

When A Liang was drinking, he swore and slammed the table, cursing some sword immortal for being shameless enough to eavesdrop on his conversation with Lu Zhi! Was it acceptable for private conversations with a lady to spread so casually? Even if what he said was scholarly, profound, and carried a certain flair, had he gotten A Liang or Miss Lu's permission?

Chen Ping'an was enjoying his free wine and felt quite satisfied to find himself ranked eleventh in Yuan Zao Hua's heart at such a young age.

A drunken patron casually asked, "Second shopkeeper, I heard you have a sword immortal friend from the North Julu Continent who has impressive demon-slaying skills and an even greater talent for drinking?”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his chin, thought seriously for a moment, and nodded, "You all together wouldn't stand a chance against him."

Naturally, no one believed him.

Zhang Jiazhen watched the dazed Chen Ping'an amidst the lively chatter.

At that moment, it seemed like Chen Ping'an wanted to drink with that person?

Chen Ping'an smiled, turned his gaze toward the small street, and envisioned a scene.

Qi Jinglong and Cao Qinglang were walking side by side.

Chen Ping'an raised his bowl of wine, picked up his utensils, and stood up, loudly proclaiming, "Esteemed sword immortals, today’s drinks are on me!”

All the patrons fell silent.

What was going on? The second shopkeeper was treating them?! 

Unexpectedly, that guy chuckled, "Remember to settle the bill!"

For the next three days, Liu patiently accompanied Jin Su and several osmanthus girls, touring all the scenic spots on Downward Mountain. Bai Shou had no interest in places like the White Head and Fragrant Tower, nor did he feel anything special about the Sword Respect Pavilion, which hung portraits of many sword immortals. Ultimately, he was still a youth who hadn't yet truly regarded himself as a sword cultivator. Bai Shou was particularly fascinated by the Thunder Marsh Pavilion, where thunder roared, and lightning flashed; it looked exhilarating. He had heard that the female martial god from the Central Land had recently forged a sword there, but unfortunately, those sisters had stayed longer only to cater to the boy's feelings and then moved on to the Elk Cliff, where they immediately began to chatter and laugh. At the base of Elk Cliff, there was an entire street of shops, thick with the scent of cosmetics. Even the relatively composed Jin Su couldn’t help but loosen the purse strings, rolling his eyes at Bai Shou’s antics—women!

Qi Jinglong strolled along at the back, carefully observing the various sights. Even at the foot of Elk Cliff, he was earnest, occasionally helping the osmanthus girls keep an eye on their belongings.

Bai Shou realized that at least two of the osmanthus girls had their eyes on Liu. When they spoke to him, their voices took on a particularly soft tone, and their gazes were intensely focused.

Bai Shou found it strange; they didn’t know who Liu was, had no idea about the Taihui Sword Sect, and were oblivious to the legendary earthly dragon of the North Julu Continent. To them, he looked like a somewhat broke, bookish young man. Why had they taken such a liking to him? Could it be that Liu's life sword technique was so impressive that it made women swoon? If that were true, Bai Shou thought he could learn something about sword techniques from him.

Regardless, no unexpected incidents occurred.

Qi Jinglong wouldn't tell the youth that two groups had stealthily followed them, both of whom had been scared off by him.

The first had revealed the aura of a Golden Core sword cultivator, and the second was an old man who had appeared, forcing Qi Jinglong to raise his level as a courtesy.

After that, nothing else happened.

Bai Shou seemed to be casually hanging around, seemingly uninterested, but as a direct disciple of the Taihui Sword Sect's Grandmaster Hall, he was more akin to an assassin from the early days, cautiously observing the surroundings.

Qi Jinglong felt somewhat gratified.

With the Symbol family, it was destined that they wouldn't stir up any trouble on his end, so could Bai Shou relax entirely, carefree, and casually explore Downward Mountain?

Even within their own Taihui Sword Sect, how many direct disciples, after becoming a disciple, subtly changed their thoughts and feelings? Their actions and behaviors might appear normal and respectful, adhering to the rules, yet they were often marked by minute traces of deviation from their true intentions. A single misstep could lead one down a different path over time. Qi Jinglong, while practicing in the Taihui Sword Sect and on the Elegant Peak, would do his best to help his junior disciples maintain their pure hearts. However, some matters related to the fundamental principles of the Dao were still beyond discussion.

Thus, Qi Jinglong was not fond of the terms "immortal seeds" and "innate sword embryos."

Jin Su and the others returned home, all satisfied. After this short adventure, even Jin Su had changed her impression of Qi Jinglong, expressing her sincere gratitude upon parting.

Qi Jinglong accompanied them all the way to the Catch and Release Pavilion before taking Bai Shou to the Stork and Sparrow Inn to settle the bill. He planned to stay at the Spring Banner Pavilion and then return to the inn, where the youth was half-laughing at his misfortune.

Because in the inn stood a familiar woman of stunning beauty—Lu Sui, the Water Journey Mountain fairy, ranked eighth among the young ten of the North Julu Continent, praised as the ideal partner for Liu Jinglong of the Taihui Sword Sect.

Lu Sui softly said, "Jinglong, I heard you and Bai Shou have been in Downward Mountain for three days, so I came to hurry you along. I've already settled the bill; you won't hold it against me, will you?"

Qi Jinglong felt helpless inside, shaking his head with a smile, as if to say whether it was right or wrong, it was a mistake to say anything at all. 

At moments like this, Qi Jinglong often missed Chen Ping'an.

The innkeeper wondered greatly. The Spring Banner Pavilion personally sent someone to invite him? 

This young man in a blue robe was a bit too arrogant, wasn't he? 

Places like the Spring Banner Pavilion and the Monkey Rub Mansion usually wouldn't let anyone in unless they were leading a group of cultivators from the Fifth Realm. 

Qi Jinglong smiled at the innkeeper and bid farewell.

The young innkeeper leaned on the counter, nodding with a smile. A little innkeeper like him didn't need to be overly polite with such immortal beings. After all, he knew he could never reach such heights, and he wasn't keen on bending over backward to please others. It was better to live a stable life, making a little money without overthinking. It was nice to occasionally see young people like Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong, whose potential seemed limitless. Who knows, maybe if they became famous in the future, business at the Stork and Sparrow Inn would flourish.

However, gaining some fame at Downward Mountain, a place where dragons hide and tigers lie in wait, wasn't easy.

Before reaching the Spring Banner Pavilion, Bai Shou was busy chatting amiably with Lu Sui, who had a particular admiration for Water Journey Mountain, which was filled with beautiful sisters. 

The youth wasn't actually a flirt; he just enjoyed the attention from women who liked him.

Lu Sui seemed livelier than her usual cold, introspective self.

Bai Shou felt great sympathy for Lu Sui, who was obviously infatuated with Liu, lamenting that the latter didn't appreciate her. She deserved better than being forced to drink herself into a stupor twice by Xu Xing from Cloud City.

The owner of the Spring Banner Pavilion, in an unprecedented move, personally hosted Qi Jinglong.

Lu Sui brewed tea for the two sword immortals of different ages while the young Bai Shou felt a little awkward.

For some reason, Bai Shou felt no fear regarding the Taihui Sword Sect, nor did he fear Liu, but after encountering the sword immortal Huang Tong, who was the chief lawmaker, he began to feel anxious.

In fact, this journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall was to meet the sect leader Han Huaizi; Bai Shou was even more frightened.

At this moment, he found himself sitting opposite the Spring Banner Pavilion's Shao Yunyan, feeling just as uneasy.

After all, he was a legendary sword immortal.

Someone who could stand at the pinnacle of the North Julu Continent, where sword cultivators were as numerous as clouds.

As for why his own master was also a sword immortal, they lived and trained together, Bai Shou had never given it much thought.

He merely observed how his master was treated among the small cultivators from Osmanthus Island and how he was treated at the Spring Banner Pavilion upon meeting the sword immortal host.

Taking the cup of tea Lu Sui offered, Bai Shou lowered his head to drink, gradually calming down.

Qi Jinglong brought up the matter of the sword-raising gourd they had planned to obtain.

Shao Yunyan smiled and agreed, providing a very fair price.

Qi Jinglong thanked him.

Bai Shou broke out in a cold sweat when he heard the figure mentioned earlier regarding the Gu Yu coins.

Shao Yunyan remarked, "Beyond this deal, the Taihui Sword Sect doesn't owe me any favor. However, you, my friend Qi, do owe me a favor. To speak plainly, if among the fourteen gourds, seven are successfully refined within this millennium, they are all preordained and cannot be rescinded. However, if one person can't follow through on their purchase, you have the opportunity to voice your request, and only then can I agree. Within this millennium, to repay the favor, you only need to draw your sword once. Moreover, you can rest assured; your sword will definitely be justified, and I won’t let you be put in a difficult position."

Qi Jinglong smiled, "That works."

Then Qi Jinglong hesitated, asking, "If the number of sword-raising gourds exceeds seven, may I reserve one more?"

Shao Yunyan smiled, "Only the highest bidder will get it. I believe it will be hard for you to have your wish fulfilled."

Shao Yunyan refrained from saying some practical truths; even if an additional sword-raising gourd was reserved, it wasn’t something just anyone could obtain. Qi Jinglong had three advantages in securing this gourd: first, Shao Yunyan and the Spring Banner Pavilion valued Qi Jinglong, who had already reached the Jade Pure realm; second, Qi Jinglong was very likely to be the next sect leader of the Taihui Sword Sect; third, Shao Yunyan himself hailed from the North Julu Continent, which could be considered a trivial connection.

These words didn't need further elaboration, as the young earthly dragon was already aware of them.

Qi Jinglong said, "I've indeed thought too much."

Shao Yunyan smiled, "Thanks to you, I can enjoy Lu's tea."

Lu Sui was the most valued direct disciple of the Water Journey Mountain sect leader.

And the only person Shao Yunyan owed in life was Lu Sui's master.

Back in the day, the innate treasure gourd vine they had obtained together was a stroke of luck for both, yet they had never managed to become immortal companions for various reasons. As for the gourd vine's ownership, she had never changed her mind; the more she held on, the more uneasy Shao Yunyan felt. Hence, he regarded her talented disciple Lu Sui as his own daughter. Moreover, Lu Sui's infatuation with Liu Jinglong mirrored Shao Yunyan's past with Lu Sui's master.

Bai Shou felt a bit of discomfort; why did this sword immortal behave similarly to Chen Ping'an, one calling Qi Jinglong "friend" and the other referring to him as "Daoist Qi"?

Regarding this matter, Bai Shou had heard some rumors at the Elegant Peak; it seemed Liu originally had the surname Qi. After ascending the mountain to cultivate, he registered his name at the Grandmaster Hall as Liu Jinglong.

After finishing the tea and finalizing the agreement for the sword-raising gourd, Shao Yunyan soon took his leave.

Lu Sui remained behind to brew tea.

Bai Shou watched Lu Sui's graceful tea-brewing technique and found it quite pleasing.

Lu Sui smiled, "Jinglong, have you noticed some inner workings of Downward Mountain?"

Qi Jinglong nodded, "The Catch and Release Pavilion and the Master’s Blade Room are among eight scenic spots, all positioned as the eyes of a large formation. Downward Mountain is not merely a mountain as it appears; it is a layered, offensively and defensively crafted immortal weapon. As for the origins of the formation, it should be one of the three ancient methods left by the Three Mountains and Nine Lords. Its greatest marvel lies in refining water with the mountain, reversing the heavens and earth, and once invoked, it can turn the world upside down."

Lu Sui's eyes sparkled; even though she merely glanced at Liu, she soon lowered her head to watch the fire, unable to conceal her swirling thoughts.

Qi Jinglong, however, was lost in thought about the great formation of Downward Mountain.

Bai Shou felt like he wanted to smash Liu's head with a hammer.

Lu Sui suddenly remembered something, "My master is friends with Sword Immortal Li, so I can accompany you to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Along with me on this journey through Downward Mountain is that girl, Long Cong, whom you should have met. I’m here just to accompany her on this trip."

Qi Jinglong nodded, seeming to think this was a natural matter.

Bai Shou felt utterly drained watching this, nearly choking on his tea. How could Lu Sui come to Downward Mountain and then to the Sword Qi Great Wall? Could she not see through this? 

Nodding? Nodding your head!

This was not something Bai Shou could overlook; his brother Chen was bound to leap ahead of Liu by eighteen streets!

Forget it; he’d discuss it with Chen Ping'an when they met.

At that time, he, Bai Shou, would ask his good brother Chen Ping'an to impart a few tricks on sword techniques.

Lu Sui had already grown accustomed to pouring tea for Qi Jinglong, softly saying, "I heard a talented martial artist from the Central Land has come to Water Crystal Palace. She’s at the Golden Body realm and has recently broken through her bottleneck at the Golden Armor Continent. She wants to go to the city wall to learn from the punches that Cao Ci practiced there for several years."

Qi Jinglong smiled, "I have a friend who is also practicing punches at the Sword Qi Great Wall; perhaps they will meet."

Bai Shou felt a surge of panic upon hearing about a martial artist, especially a female one.

Lu Sui asked curiously, "Is that Chen Ping'an from Baoping Continent?"

Last time at the Sanlang Temple, Qi Jinglong had mentioned this name, and it seemed that Qi Jinglong had gone to the trouble of buying things at Hate Sword Mountain and Sanlang Temple just for Chen Ping'an. Thus, Lu Sui had a very vivid memory of him.

Qi Jinglong nodded with a smile.

Lu Sui laughed, "I’m quite curious about this Chen Ping'an; he has managed to impress Jinglong so much."

Qi Jinglong remained silent.

Bai Shou couldn't help but speak up, "Sister Lu, my good brother isn’t particularly gifted; he just knows how to drink better than anyone in the world!"

Qi Jinglong turned his head, smiling as he looked at Bai Shou.

The youth, brimming with righteousness, declared, "Chen Ping'an's drinking habits are simply too poor! Having a brother like that, I truly feel a sense of shame!"

Lu Sui couldn't help but laugh, wondering how Jinglong had found such a reckless disciple.

On the city wall.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia was teaching sword techniques to Lin Junbi and Yan Lu. The techniques Ku Xia taught were ones that the Sword Qi Great Wall permitted external sword cultivators to study.

Everyone sat on straw mats, listening attentively to Sword Immortal Ku Xia's guidance.

Ku Xia first explained the essence of the sword Dao's key points, then broke down a series of crucial energy operations, guidance, and responses, detailing them with great precision. He encouraged everyone to ask questions about their misunderstandings or present the difficulties they perceived, and Ku Xia would mostly have Lin Junbi, who had the best aptitude and understanding, resolve the issues. Only if Lin Junbi fell short would Ku Xia step in to fill the gaps.

The peculiar thing about this superior sword technique was that it only showed significant results when practiced within the Sword Qi Great Wall’s small world. It could be forcibly practiced in the Haoran world, but the effects would be minimal. For outsiders who had the opportunity to access this sword technique, it wouldn’t hold much significance, as most were disciples of sects who lacked superior sword techniques.

In short, this sword technique was too dependent on timing and location. To benefit one’s sword path and soul, even someone as talented as Lin Junbi had to rely on the slow grind of practice on the city wall.

Ku Xia was secretly worried because the one who should have been teaching the sword technique was the local sword immortal Sun Juyuan. However, Sun Juyuan had a poor opinion of this group of future pillars of the Shaoyuan Dynasty and had simply walked away, pushing excuses away. Initially, Ku Xia was reluctant to settle for second best and teach himself, but after Sun Juyuan had been annoyed enough, he finally told Ku Xia plainly that if the Shaoyuan Dynasty hoped to bring people back to the Sword Qi Great Wall again, they needed to avoid putting Sun Juyuan in a difficult position.

Ku Xia glanced at his direct disciple Jiang Guancheng and sighed inwardly.

He was worried about Jiang Guancheng's straightforward nature, yet he felt that a sword cultivator’s study of the sword and their character need not resemble Lin Junbi too closely. Furthermore, compared to some petty-minded youths surrounding Jiang Guancheng, Ku Xia found his disciple much more agreeable. There were clear reasons behind Ku Xia's choice to take Jiang Guancheng as a disciple; their paths were aligned. However, Jiang Guancheng’s path to greatness still required more refinement.

Lin Junbi sat on the mat, hands resting on his abdomen, smiling serenely, exuding the rare demeanor of an otherworldly immortal.

Yan Lu was diligently studying Lin Junbi, focused on every aspect of how he interacted with others and how he handled things. She felt that despite his youth, Lin Junbi was worth her effort to analyze and reflect upon.

In the past, Yan Lu had a simplistic view of people, dividing them into foolish and clever. Good or evil didn’t concern her; those who could be of use to her were friends, while those who couldn’t were merely acquaintances with whom she exchanged pleasantries.

Within this group of sword cultivators, there were no fools. Only those who were either smart enough or not sufficiently clever.

The less clever included Ku Xia's direct disciple Jiang Guancheng and that foolish girl who harbored feelings for Lin Junbi.

The smart ones were those who had once spoken for Lin Junbi, appearing to confuse right and wrong, but in reality, they understood the gravity of their actions. What did they seek? They merely wanted to sweet-talk Lin Junbi, drawing benefits without cost. Deep down, they probably hoped that Lin Junbi, in his youthful arrogance, would have a falling out with Chen Ping'an, causing him to act rashly. Even if it came to a point where they had a falling out, the outcome would be advantageous for them, as the strong dragon could not overpower the local snake, leading to Lin Junbi's embarrassment at Chen Ping'an's hands.

On the path of cultivation, losing a Lin Junbi was a matter of no concern to these people; they were willing to do it, especially when there was a chance to benefit themselves. 

After all, within the Shaoyuan Dynasty, interests were deeply intertwined. This joint journey was a chance for Lin Junbi to shine, and somehow, even the younger generation of the Shaoyuan Dynasty was beginning to perceive a truth: if Lin Junbi managed to successfully ascend to the peak, all sword cultivators of the Shaoyuan Dynasty would face the awkward situation of one person monopolizing the Dao.

Lin Junbi would become like Cao Ci on the martial path of the Central Land.

Those who walked the same path as him would be deserving of sympathy.

Outside of this group, Zhu Mei and Jin Zhenmeng were another kind of person, seemingly less calculating.

Yet Yan Lu preferred not to associate too much with such individuals.

Deep down, Yan Lu favored engaging with those who were willing to put effort into building relationships, rather than those ungrateful wolves.

Dealing with Zhu Mei, whose background was no less than her own, or trying to win over Jin Zhenmeng, whose resolve and sword intent were pure, required Yan Lu to expend a great deal of effort she was neither willing nor skilled at giving.

While Lin Junbi was partly acting as a preacher, he had already divided his attention.

On this city wall, every so often, there would be a sword immortal stationed at various locations.

As for the others present, including Yan Lu, Lin Junbi never considered them his equals; their hearts were too weak, their talents too lacking, and their minds too foolish. Thus, all their connections and backgrounds were illusory. At times, Lin Junbi would even find it amusing and want to say to them: you should cherish this current time, as being able to walk alongside me Lin Junbi on this grand road is a privilege. After all, you can still catch a glimpse of my silhouette as we practice swords together on the city wall.

The borders had not followed Sword Immortal Ku Xia to learn sword techniques on the city wall.

Instead, they had gone to the Mirage, where there was a good place, known as the Martial Arts Arena, which was somewhat similar to the Ti Li Mountain of the North Julu Continent. Here, the two sides would confront each other, without distinguishing winners or losers, only life and death.

However, unlike Ti Li Mountain, this arena only allowed battles between those of the same realm, betting on each other's lives and winning everything the other had, along with a significant portion of the bets.

The disputes among sword cultivators were not the most thrilling, and opportunities to witness them were rare. Generally, unless both sides had formed a deep grudge, they wouldn't come here. Additionally, sword cultivators often finished their duels in an instant, leaving little to watch, making it quite dull.

What was truly exciting was the clash between sword cultivators and other Qi practitioners. The most thrilling situation would be when a Qi practitioner could miraculously exchange blows with the strongest sword cultivator.

A handful of sword cultivators voluntarily ventured into such risks, not only to hone their skills but also to earn money to feed their flying swords.

The other Qi practitioners were willing to risk their lives by entering the Martial Arts Arena, but it was not out of a desire for death. Most were brought here against their will on intercontinental ferries, either wild cultivators from the Haoran world or the lost souls of destroyed immortal sects. If they could survive three battles against Qi practitioners of the same realm, they would be allowed to live. If they dared to take the initiative to fight again, they could win money according to the rules. If they could successfully kill a sword cultivator, they would be granted their freedom.

There had once been a Confucian disciple who lamented this absurdity, asserting that it was a gross disregard for human life. He questioned why the Sword Qi Great Wall did not impose restrictions, allowing so many wild cultivators to be imprisoned and perish here.

Moreover, a wealthy lady from one of the major kingdoms of the Central Land, with a strong backing and her own intercontinental ferry, had come to Downward Mountain. She stayed directly at the Monkey Rub Mansion, acting like a hostess, and was particularly extravagant at the Lingzhi Pavilion, drawing attention to herself. Accompanying her were two attendants: a Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm in martial arts, and a concealed expert from the top Fifth Realm of the military system. When she observed the Martial Arts Arena, she felt pity for the wild cultivators of the Haoran world who had been captured and brought here and sympathized with the demon sword cultivators treated as “grinding stones.” She believed that since they had already taken on human forms, they should be treated as humans; such mistreatment was inhumane and against propriety. So, she caused a scene at the Mirage and arrogantly left. As a result, that day, her military attendant was gravely injured by a local sword immortal leaving the city wall, while the Ninth Realm martial artist didn't even dare to strike back, knowing that besides the sword immortal, there were more watching immortals ready to draw their swords at any moment. She had to swallow her anger and seek help from the sword immortal Sun Juyuan, only to be shown the door. Their belongings were tossed out onto the street in front of the Sun residence, and they received a curt "get lost" from Sun Juyuan.

The lady left the Sword Qi Great Wall in tears, and upon returning to the Haoran world, she leveraged her family status and wealth to gather an entire wave of literary giants and scholars, publicly criticizing the barbaric customs of the Sword Qi Great Wall. One of her most biting remarks was, "The sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall are no different from the demons of the wild world!" However, after that incident, no one from her family, sect, or kingdom could set foot in Downward Mountain. Not just the Sword Qi Great Wall, but they couldn't even ascend Downward Mountain; anyone daring to sneak up would be met with a sword strike from the guarding sword immortal, and their fate would be left to the heavens.

This incident had caused quite an uproar back then.

But the top sword immortal said nothing, and the Dong family, who had been responsible for handling the matter, remained confident.

Today, the borders not only watched the fights but also placed bets on several outcomes, with life and death wagers often yielding predictable results. After all, the stakes weren't high; those who had been gambling here for many years had a keen eye. Therefore, the real money-making or losing bets were on how long it would take for someone to die. As for betting on both sides dying, if it did happen, it could often yield a few years of carefree drinking, and the divine wines brewed at the Sword Qi Great Wall were indeed not cheap.

Sitting in a crowded corner of the viewing platform, the borders quietly drank, waiting for the participants of today’s lethal duel to arrive.

First, a sword cultivator from the Haoran world made his way into the arena, followed by a tattered, injured demon sword cultivator. Though covered in injuries, he did not lose his fighting spirit; demons were inherently resilient, and when hurt, their ferocity only grew. As a sword cultivator, his killing power was even greater.

Such a standoff was quite rare.

The borders watched the dazed young demon sword cultivator, hearing that in the wild world just a wall away, anyone who became a sword cultivator was hailed as a "seed of the Dao," similar to the "scholarly seeds" of the Haoran world.

It was said that this demon had snuck into the battlefield after a great war, hoping to scavenge broken sword remains, but was captured by the patrolling sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall and brought to the prison. Ultimately, he shared a fate similar to many demons, being tossed into this arena; if he died, he died. If he survived, he would be returned to the prison to recover and await the next battle, never knowing who his opponent would be.

The borders weren't surprised why so many travelers from the Haoran world felt a twinge of sympathy.

So now, while drinking, the borders looked forward to the day when the Sword Qi Great Wall would be breached, wondering if the demons would show some compassion for those kind-hearted people when that day came.

The borders sank into their small world of thoughts, unknowingly drawing the attention of an existence hidden deep within their heart lake. When that existence glimpsed the borders' heart, it grinned; its body was filled with an unparalleled wild aura. Just this slight movement caused the energies of a Golden Core cultivator’s many innate acupoints to tremble and boil like oil in a pot. Fortunately, the aura dispersed slightly, and there was no need for the borders to suppress it with their will; soon, that existence receded its aura to avoid revealing any clues, which would lead to its certain demise at the hands of local sword immortals. These sword immortals were not mere kittens or puppies of the Jade Pure realm; after all, one of the old geezers among the surnames Dong, Qi, or Chen might be troublesome. 

In the end, achieving great heights in the wild world, the scholars of the Haoran world possessed a certain degree of gravitas when it came to the principles of the Dao. 

It merely spoke to the borders' heart, "Once the plan is complete, my merit will be enough for you to acquire a celestial weapon, and along with our previous agreement, I can ensure that you become a sword cultivator of the immortal realm. As for whether you can ascend to become a sword immortal of the ascended realm, that will solely depend on your own fortune. Once you attain the ascended realm with a good sword, what do the Haoran world or the wild world matter? No place will be off-limits for you! What are Lin Junbi and Chen Ping'an? They are merely ants not worth your glance."

Currently, there were two main gates connecting Downward Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Qi Jinglong and Bai Shou, along with Lu Sui and Ren Longcong, entered the Sword Qi Great Wall together.

Bai Shou felt dizzy and squatted down to dry heave, while Qi Jinglong crouched down and gently pressed down on the youth's shoulder.

Ren Longcong was not much better off, forcing herself to endure as Lu Sui held her hand, helping her stabilize her energy. With her pale complexion, Ren Longcong gradually felt a bit better.

At almost the same time, at another gate, a woman left the Water Crystal Palace alone, arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall. When she stopped, her fist intent flowed freely, showing no discomfort at all toward the overwhelming natural pressure of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Her journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall was originally to trace Cao Ci’s footsteps, intending to stay in the small cottage he had built on the city wall to temper her Golden Body realm, hoping to ascend to the Traveling Realm at the seventh realm. However, after hearing some stories at the Water Crystal Palace, she felt that it was fate! Thus, her only desire now was to face the person frequently mentioned by Cao Ci and Liu Youzhou at the city wall, challenging him to a fistfight, demanding he lose three consecutive matches! 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 704: The Perilous Question Before the Duel

Bai Shou found it difficult to adapt to the customs of the Sword Qi Great Wall, feeling rather unwell, and shared a mutual sympathy with Ren Longceng, who was in a similar state. This was the fundamental reason why Qi Practitioners below the Earth Immortal level were reluctant to stay long at the Sword Qi Great Wall; they simply could not endure it, as if they were being forced back into a cave dwelling, constantly suffering from the influx of seawater.

Young sword cultivators fared better; in the long run, they could benefit from the experience, nourishing their souls and flying swords. However, for Qi Practitioners from various schools and sects outside of sword cultivation, merely unraveling the sword intent from the spiritual energy in the world was a monumental challenge. Historically, during the relatively stable intervals of major battles at the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were not a few reckless young Qi Practitioners who arrived from the Suspended Mountain, forcing themselves to ascend the city walls. Accompanied by attendants who were often of a similarly low level, they inevitably found themselves falling back in realm whenever they attempted to escort their attendants to the main gate.

“Since your friend is within the city, why not accompany me to Bai Mai Mansion on Taixiang Street? The Sword Immortal Song Lü has deep ties with our Northern Julu Prefecture,” Lu Sui suggested tentatively.

Lu Sui was well aware that her proposal was somewhat inconsiderate, but she feared that after parting today, Liu Jinglong would bury himself in sword practice, losing himself completely in it. What would she do then? They had traveled thousands of miles to meet at the Suspended Mountain, and she had only exchanged a few glances with him. Was she to let this be their last encounter, merely to prepare to return to the Suspended Mountain to say goodbye? However, if they shared a stay at Song Lü’s Bai Mai Mansion, even if Liu Jinglong was still deeply engrossed in sword practice, retreating from the world, Lu Sui would feel content just to be under the same roof, regardless of the weather. Ultimately, they would share the same scenery.

Bai Shou agreed, “That makes sense! Let’s not disturb the sect master’s cultivation; we should go disturb Sword Immortal Song Lü instead.”

Bai Shou was hesitant to meet the sect master of the Taihui Sword Sect, Han Huaizi, having heard many discussions among peers at the Piao Ran Peak. It seemed this sect master was a stern old fellow, and everyone spoke of him with great respect. In contrast, the elder Huang Tong, whom Bai Shou had met once, was full of interesting stories. Nevertheless, when Bai Shou truly faced Huang Tong, he felt just as uneasy. If even Sword Immortal Huang Tong was so intimidating, what would it be like to meet the head of the Taihui Sword Sect? Bai Shou worried that he might say something inappropriate and be expelled from the master’s hall on the spot. If that happened, then the most respectful of teachers, Liu Jinglong, would have to obey without question. Bai Shou did not feel a sense of loss over the teacher-disciple relationship; rather, he was saddened by the thought of losing the prestige and respect he had built up at Piao Ran Peak.

Lu Sui smiled knowingly. 

Ren Longceng was not fond of this outspoken youth.

Qi Jinglong shook his head. “I don’t know Sword Immortal Song Lü, so it would be too presumptuous to visit him directly. Besides, it would waste Miss Lu’s goodwill toward our sect. It’s not proper. What’s more, out of courtesy, I should first pay my respects to the sect master. Moreover, Senior Li’s Wan He Residence is not far from our Taihui Sword Sect’s mansion. After our sword exchange earlier, Senior Li left in a hurry, so I need to thank him in person.”

Sword Immortals visiting from afar had many idle private residences available between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the cities, which they could choose from freely, simply informing the hidden officials and the Jianxian Luo Shan. If a local sword immortal invited them to stay within the city, they could certainly accept. Those who preferred to remain on the city walls could also choose a place to guard without hindrance.

After the arrival of Sword Immortals Han Huaizi and Huang Tong to the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Taihui Sword Sect of Northern Julu Prefecture had, through their achievements in slaying monsters, earned a sizable estate known as the Jia Zhang Ku. All disciples of the Taihui Sword Sect now had a place to stay at the Sword Qi Great Wall, no longer needing to rely on others. In contrast, Sect Master Li Cai of the Floating Petal Sword Lake had just arrived and had no familiarity with local sword immortals. Hence, he simply selected the residence of a fallen sword immortal from their region, the “Wan He Residence,” showing no fear of the “bad luck” associated with it. On the very day he moved in, many local sword immortals offered him their respect.

Lu Sui smiled. “Jinglong, then I’ll take the opportunity to visit Sect Master Han.”

Qi Jinglong nodded. “Of course, the sect master greatly admires your Dao, Miss Lu. If you are willing to visit our place, the sect master will surely be pleased.”

Lu Sui smiled, her eyes curving delightfully.

Ren Longceng took a deep breath and turned away, unwilling to watch Lu Sui and that dullard Liu Jinglong. The more she saw, the more she felt compelled to scold someone.

Bai Shou also felt that Liu was rather infuriating. Was the sect master’s pleasure what Miss Lu truly cared about? With all those flirtatious glances from her, even a blind man should have caught a few! Yet Liu, with his abilities, managed to evade each one.

After parting ways, Qi Jinglong focused on taking care of his disciple Bai Shou. Instead of flying on his sword to the already registered Jia Zhang Ku estate, he chose to walk, allowing the young man to familiarize himself with the flow of sword intent in this area. However, Qi Jinglong seemed somewhat oblivious, softly asking, “Did I say something inconsiderate to Miss Lu earlier?”

Bai Shou retorted, “What kind of joke is that?”

Qi Jinglong let out a sigh of relief, glad it was not the case.

Bai Shou added, “You didn’t say a single considerate word.”

Qi Jinglong lamented, “So it seems.”

Bai Shou inquired, “Liu, why don’t you like Sister Lu? There’s nothing wrong with her. In our Northern Julu Prefecture, the young heroes who admire her are countless. Why is it that she likes you, but you don’t appreciate her?”

Qi Jinglong helplessly replied, “There’s no reasoning behind this matter.”

Following the edge of the city, the pair headed south, covering more than a hundred miles until they found the Jia Zhang Ku.

For cultivators, even without riding the wind or flying on swords, a hundred-mile journey felt like traversing through streets and alleys. Even if Bai Shou could not completely adapt to the suffocating atmosphere of the Sword Qi Great Wall for now, his pace still outstripped the common folk, moving as swiftly as a galloping horse.

Along the way, they passed a few scattered estates, mostly occupied by sword immortals of the upper realms or visiting Earth Immortal sword cultivators.

At the entrance stood Han Huaizi, the sect master of the Taihui Sword Sect. Qi Jinglong bowed, “I am Liu Jinglong from Piao Ran Peak, paying my respects to the sect master.”

Bai Shou discreetly swallowed, imitating Liu by bowing deeply and tremblingly said, “I am Bai Shou, the sixteenth direct disciple of the Ancestor Hall of the Taihui Sword Sect, from Piao Ran Peak, paying my respects to the sect master!”

Han Huaizi was the fourth sect master of the Taihui Sword Sect, but the lineage of the Ancestor Hall extended far beyond that.

Although the Taihui Sword Sect did not have a long history in Northern Julu Prefecture, each sect master was a sword immortal, and besides the sect master, there were usually assisting sword immortals like Huang Tong standing by their side atop the Northern Julu mountains. Each sect master also had varying degrees of lineage expansion. For instance, Liu Jinglong, who did not enter the Ancestor Hall as a natural sword seed, had a lower status, since the mentor who brought him up the mountain was merely a fourteenth-generation direct disciple of the Ancestor Hall. Thus, Bai Shou could only claim to be the sixteenth generation. However, in the vast world of righteous sects, once someone ascended to the peak or inherited the Dao lineage, the hierarchy of the Ancestor Hall would adjust accordingly. For example, if Liu Jinglong were to become sect master, his lineage in the Ancestor Hall would naturally undergo a “promotion” ceremony, and Bai Shou, as the first disciple of Piao Ran Peak, would consequently elevate to the sixth generation of the Taihui Sword Sect’s “ancestral master.”

However, regarding the naming conventions of generations, aside from those who were promoted due to extraordinary circumstances or inherited the Dao lineage as new sect masters or mountain lords, the direct disciples of these individuals were not restricted to the old historical rankings of the Ancestor Hall.

Han Huaizi raised his hand with a smile, “No need for such formalities. During your time here, whether long or short, we should follow local customs. Otherwise, with just the three of us in this house, who are we putting on a show for? Right, Bai Shou?”

Bai Shou’s face fell. Right? Definitely not right.

Not right? Then even more so not right.

So Bai Shou looked pitifully at Liu.

Qi Jinglong laughed, “What great courage you have that you shrink to nothing when you arrive in front of the sect master?”

When with Liu, Bai Shou still had the audacity to blurt out, “It’s all that dumb fish from the mute lake. It named itself ‘Rice Grain.’”

Suddenly realizing that a towering sword immortal sect master was present, Bai Shou broke into a cold sweat and directly expressed his thoughts, “Sect Master, I know I have misspoken. Please don’t expel me from the Taihui Sword Sect!”

Han Huaizi found it both amusing and perplexing. Fortunately, Jinglong had previously mentioned in a letter how he had taken in this kind of disciple; otherwise, he would have been somewhat unprepared.

Han Huaizi smiled and reassured him, “At the Sword Qi Great Wall, there are indeed many taboos regarding speech and behavior. You should not take for granted your status as a sword cultivator of the Taihui Sword Sect, nor should you be arrogant. You need not be overly restrained in your own home. While cultivating here, feel free to think and ask questions. The disciples of the Taihui Sword Sect should have pure and bright sword hearts on their cultivation paths, respecting their teachers, and boldly striking out against injustices with their swords. That is the greatest path.”

Bai Shou was stunned.

This was a far cry from the Han Huaizi he had imagined, the kind who would throw around his sword immortal authority at the slightest provocation.

Qi Jinglong teased, “You should loudly proclaim, ‘I remember!’”

Bai Shou quickly chimed in, “I remember!”

Qi Jinglong had no choice but to smile, having never seen such an obedient Bai Shou before.

Han Huaizi suppressed a laugh and joked with the young man, “What do you need to remember? There’s no need for a young sword cultivator to deliberately remember these grandiose words.”

Bai Shou was almost thrown off by the sect master’s demeanor.

Then, Han Huaizi led both of them through the grand entrance of the Jia Zhang Ku, recounting its history. 

He spoke of the sword immortals who had once resided there, when and how they had perished in battle.

Bai Shou felt a profound respect and unconsciously slowed his breathing and steps.

The youth sensed that each breath and every step he took seemed to disturb the resting place of those senior sword immortals.

Han Huaizi discreetly observed the boy's complexion and expression, then subtly nodded to Qi Jinglong.

A young woman, deliberately using her own fist intent to counter sword energy, was dressed in a red outfit, her hair tied up in a neat bun, wearing cloth shoes. She carried a backpack filled with rations and did not enter the city; instead, she headed directly for the Sword Qi Great Wall. A mile from the wall, she started sprinting forward and leapt onto the towering city wall, bending low to surge upward, step by step climbing higher.

When she was just a few feet from the top of the wall, she stomped heavily against the stone surface and leapt up, gracefully landing atop the wall.

She then walked slowly to the left, following the words of Cao Ci, as the little thatched cottage she sought should be within thirty miles.

As she made her way, she encountered no stationed sword immortals, as there was no need for anyone to guard against formidable demons near the two small thatched houses. No one would dare ascend the city walls to show off their prowess and still return safely to the southern territories.

All thanks to that old sword immortal.

She suddenly frowned, having sensed an overwhelming sword energy from the opposite city wall.

It should be that rumored great sword immortal, who had shattered countless innate sword seeds' hearts before going out to sea in search of immortals.

However, as she drew closer to the thatched cottage, she noticed a young-looking sword immortal turning to look at her.

She continued onward, glancing at the nearby thatched cottage before returning her gaze and cupped her hands, asking, “Are you temporarily residing in the thatched cottage, senior?”

Wei Jin smiled and nodded, saying, “If you don’t mind, I can move out of the cottage.”

She replied, “I do mind. So, please continue to stay.”

She halted, sat cross-legged, took out a flatbread, and began to eat heartily.

Wei Jin chuckled, not minding her presence, and continued to cultivate with her eyes closed.

After finishing her flatbread, the woman took out a water flask and asked, “Do you know where the Sword Immortal Ku Xia from the Shao Yuan Dynasty is currently located on the city wall?”

Wei Jin opened her eyes, “About seven hundred miles away, that’s where Ku Xia cultivates and resides. If nothing unexpected occurs, he should be teaching swordsmanship right now.”

The woman nodded. “Thank you.”

She shouldered her backpack, stood up, and began to practice her stances, slowly throwing punches. Each step she took spanned several yards, yet her punches moved with extreme slowness as she headed toward the seven hundred miles away.

During this time, a massive golden bird broke through the clouds, casting a shadow over the city wall, plunging the area into twilight. It landed beside a sword immortal dressed in white and shrank to the size of a sparrow, hopping onto the sword immortal’s shoulder.

One sword immortal, appearing languid, reclined on a couch, facing south, raising his head to drink.

The woman glanced briefly at him and then turned her gaze away.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia sat on a mat, surrounded by many younger sword cultivators, including Lin Junbi, who were closing their eyes, breathing deeply and trying to absorb the elusive and ever-changing essence of sword intent from the world, rather than mere spiritual energy. Otherwise, they would be picking sesame seeds and throwing away watermelons—wasting their trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall. However, apart from Lin Junbi showing significant progress, even Yan Lyu still had no clue, only able to rely on luck. During this time, someone managed to gather a wisp of sword intent, momentarily revealing a look of excitement, but their focus wavered, causing the sword intent to surge violently. Sword Immortal Ku Xia had to summon his flying sword and expel the minuscule ancient sword intent from the young sword cultivator’s small realm.

The young sword cultivator, nearly harmed the foundation of the Dao, turned pale.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia spoke to him in a steady voice, helping the young man stabilize his sword heart. As for the chaotic spiritual energy, that was a minor issue—there was no need for this sword immortal to step in to soothe him.

Anyone who could stand out among the many young talents from the Shao Yuan Dynasty and come to the Sword Qi Great Wall, if they couldn’t handle this small matter, might as well leave Sun Mansion tomorrow and return to the Suspended Mountain, waiting patiently for their companions. After all, the Plum Blossom Garden was always hospitable.

Suddenly, Sword Immortal Ku Xia stood up and turned to look, recognizing the approaching figure. This naturally gloomy sword immortal unexpectedly displayed a smile and turned to welcome the young woman.

No matter how many aliases this wandering junior had used in the world or what she was habitually called, her name on her family’s ancestral hall genealogy was devoid of any connection to the world of cosmetics.

Her surname was Yu, and her name was Juanfu.

The Yu family of Central Earth was an ancient top-tier aristocracy.

They had once helped to establish a kingdom even stronger than the current Shao Yuan Dynasty, and after the fall of that kingdom, within a century, they had built an even larger and more mysterious kingdom. 

Yu Juanfu and her fiancé Huai Qian were among the most outstanding young individuals in Central Earth. However, both had their reasons, and Yu Juanfu had run away to the Golden Armor Continent to practice boxing alone for years. Huai Qian, not doing much better, had also come to Northern Julu Prefecture, supposedly hunting and collecting the life swords of Earth Immortal sword cultivators. It was said that last year, Huai’s family ancestor had unexpectedly made an appearance, personally going out to find a friend, one of the ten notable figures from Central Earth. The reason for this was unknown.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia’s master, Zhou Shenzhi, was also among those ten, with a higher ranking, known for a popular saying, “Always looking down from above; after all, the sword path is even higher.” In the vast territory of Central Earth, Zhou Shenzhi was notoriously difficult to deal with, even with his celebrated disciple Ku Xia, he still did not show a pleasant demeanor.

Their lineage had maintained a long-standing friendship with the Yu family.

Yu Juanfu was even the most favored junior of Sword Immortal Ku Xia’s master, without any exceptions.

Zhou Shenzhi had once openly declared, “All my descendants are useless and unworthy of Yu Juanfu.”

It was known that Zhou Shenzhi’s children were famous for being talented and hailed as celestial beings.

How doting was Zhou Shenzhi towards Yu Juanfu? When she traveled the vast lands of Central Earth for three years, Zhou Shenzhi secretly protected her. When her straightforward personality inadvertently caused a major disaster and she fell into the schemes of a great immortal, Zhou Shenzhi had directly severed a hand to help her escape back to the ancestral hall, choosing to enter seclusion in a small cave. Zhou Shenzhi had leisurely followed behind her and, ultimately, the entire sect knelt in unison. From the mountain gate to the peak, anyone who dared to speak was killed, anyone who dared to look up was killed, and anyone who showed even the slightest hint of discontent was killed.

And how broad-minded was Yu Juanfu? She merely complained about Zhou Shenzhi for driving away her enemies, suggesting that her foes should be dealt with by herself. It was unexpected that Zhou Shenzhi not only did not get angry but continued to escort the little girl Yu Juanfu, returning to the Golden Armor Continent before turning back.

Upon seeing Sword Immortal Ku Xia approaching, Yu Juanfu halted and cupped her hands, “Greetings, Senior Ku Xia.”

Sword Immortal Ku Xia smiled and nodded, “What brings you here?”

Yu Juanfu replied, “Practicing boxing.”

What she said was practically nothing.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia laughed and replied with dry words, “You’ve already reached the Golden Body stage; keep up the good work.”

Then both fell into silence, yet neither felt there was anything amiss.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia was not the type to excel in flattery and did not expect to gain favor from his master by being overly attentive toward Yu Juanfu. He genuinely believed in her potential.

As for Yu Juanfu, she was jokingly referred to as the “young lady who had all her ties to elders consumed by Zhou Shenzhi.”

The betrothal between the Huai and Yu families had grown distant over time. In truth, the ancestor of the Huai family did not favor this strong-willed girl, so later, when Yu Juanfu ran away from her wedding to roam the world, the Huai family bore no resentment. Many elders of the Huai family instead comforted their Yu family friends, noting that it was good for young people to travel; there was no rush regarding the marriage, and since Huai Qian was a cultivator, while Yu Juanfu was purely a martial artist with exceptional talent, she was destined for a long life. They would allow the two children to gradually get to know each other.

The two walked back to where Sword Immortal Ku Xia was teaching swordsmanship. Ku Xia gestured for Yu Juanfu to sit on the mat. She did not hold back, taking out her backpack and starting to eat flatbread and drink water.

Lin Junbi opened his eyes and smiled slightly.

Although Yu Juanfu clearly saw him, she pretended not to notice.

Outside the gates of Ning Mansion, a young sword immortal in a green robe strolled slowly with his disciple.

The youth lowered his voice, “Liu, I heard that Chen Ping’an is quite impressive now, having earned the nickname ‘Second Storekeeper,’ especially his wife, who is formidable here at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Sword Immortal Li privately told me that she can’t stand Ning Yao; otherwise, it would vex her.”

Qi Jinglong said nothing.

They knocked on the door, and the one who opened it was Nalan Ye Xing.

Qi Jinglong introduced himself.

Nalan Ye Xing first displayed a peculiar expression, then immediately smiled and led the two of them to Dragon Slaying Cliff.

Chen Ping’an, who had been diligently cultivating Qi, had already left the pavilion and walked down Dragon Slaying Platform, waving with a smile.

Bai Shou spotted his brother Chen Ping’an and finally breathed a sigh of relief; otherwise, he would have felt too uncomfortable in the Sword Qi Great Wall every day. Just as Bai Shou was feeling relieved, he suddenly remembered that this guy was someone’s master, and his expression immediately soured, feeling utterly dispirited.

Nalan Ye Xing had already taken his leave.

Chen Ping’an brought the two of them into the pavilion and smiled, “After three rounds of sword exchanges, you feel like a Northern Julu Prefecture isn’t impressive enough, so you came to our Sword Qi Great Wall to show off?”

Qi Jinglong replied, “We were merely passing the time, visiting the sect master and Sword Immortal Li, and also came to see you.”

Chen Ping’an, with his hands clasped in his sleeves, glanced at Bai Shou, who seemed a bit glum. 

Once they reached the pavilion, the youth plopped down next to Chen Ping’an.

Qi Jinglong was indifferent; this disciple of his was indeed closer to Chen Ping’an.

Qi Jinglong laughed and revealed, “Before coming here, we stopped by Loushan. Someone heard that your first disciple had only been practicing boxing for a year or two, and they said she would crush her opponent in the Fifth Realm, even giving her a single hand.”

Chen Ping’an already had a rough idea of how it would turn out.

Qi Jinglong continued, “Your disciple is timid and asked if she could have one more leg.”

Chen Ping’an glanced at Bai Shou, holding back a laugh, “Did you agree to that?”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “I agreed. That person was so thrilled, and then said to just stand still and let Pei Qian act.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “No need to tell me the outcome.”

Chen Ping’an shook his sleeves and took out a flask of bamboo sea cave wine he had recently borrowed from a shop, “Here, let’s celebrate our Bai Shou’s auspicious opening.”

Qi Jinglong waved his hand.

Bai Shou looked up, gritting his teeth, “I can guarantee that she definitely hasn’t only been practicing boxing for a year or two! Chen Ping’an, you tell me honestly, how many years has Pei Qian been practicing boxing? Ten years?!”

Chen Ping’an tossed the wine flask to Qi Jinglong and took out another one himself, revealing the clay seal and taking a sip. This wine seemed exceptionally delicious. Chen Ping’an sat cross-legged, resting one hand on the railing while the other pressed down on the wine flask on the bench, “Did my first disciple deliver a punch or a kick? Did she get injured by our Bai Shou’s sword energy? No worries, if she did, it’s nothing. It’s just sparring; if you’re outmatched, you should just face a block of tofu and die.”

Bai Shou was so angry he nearly popped his eyes out, his fists clenched, letting out a heavy sigh as he pounded the bench.

Qi Jinglong set the wine flask beside him, laughing, “Your disciple seems even more dazed than the one who flew away. I don’t know why, but she appears particularly guilty, squatting beside someone and staring wide-eyed at the one bleeding from seven orifices. Then Pei Qian ran off to discuss with her two friends how to defuse the situation. I didn’t eavesdrop much, but I heard Pei Qian say that they absolutely can’t use wrestling as an excuse again; last time, the master didn’t truly believe it. They need to come up with something more reliable.”

Bai Shou’s face darkened.

Leaning against the railing, he covered his face with both hands.

Qi Jinglong reminded him, “I promised Pei Qian that this matter must not be disclosed. So you’ve heard it, and you must not punish Pei Qian for it. Otherwise, I will never be able to visit Loushan again.”

Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile.

He hadn’t planned to say anything about her.

Bai Shou mumbled, “I won’t go back to Loushan again. Why doesn’t Pei Qian go try her luck at our Taihui Sword Sect next time? Next time, as long as I don’t let my guard down, even if I only use half my strength…”

Before Bai Shou could finish, Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile, “Alright, I’ll tell Pei Qian. The next sparring match will be at Piao Ran Peak.”

Bai Shou instantly looked aggrieved. Just thinking about Liu’s evaluation of that troublemaker made him shout, “As long as Pei Qian isn’t around, let me say a few hard words, what’s wrong with that!”

That kick from Pei Qian had been truly ruthless.

Bai Shou not only fell to the ground bleeding from seven orifices; in fact, after struggling to open his eyes, it was like a drunk person seeing multiple versions of Pei Qian swaying in front of him.

The key was that troublemaker’s words were even more infuriating. At the time, Bai Shou’s face had turned iron gray, his lips trembled, and his limbs twitched. He had squatted to the side, perhaps seeing the dazed look in his eyes and not finding him, so he “kindly” reminded him, “I’m over here. Don’t get hurt, okay? I didn’t mean it; you spoke so boldly earlier, how was I to know you really meant it? I was worried my strength was too great and I might get hurt by that legendary sword energy, so I only used seventy or eighty percent of my strength. Otherwise, how would I explain it to the master later? Stop pretending, wake up quickly! I’m standing here, just let you hit me…”

After that, Bai Shou had fainted.

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “What a coincidence. Just before you arrived, I happened to send a letter back to Loushan. As long as Pei Qian is willing, she can immediately come to the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Bai Shou turned to ask, “Master, when are we returning to the sect? Piao Ran Peak is currently unattended, and if it rains or winds, my disciple feels uneasy.”

This should be Bai Shou’s first time sincerely calling Qi Jinglong “Master” outside the Taihui Sword Sect’s Ancestor Hall.

Qi Jinglong thought for a moment, “Let’s at least wait for Pei Qian to arrive.”

Bai Shou’s expression turned blank.

Qi Jinglong added, “By the way, I heard there’s a remarkable martial arts genius from Central Earth named Yu Juanfu who wants to spar with you.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Not interested.”

Bai Shou, feeling powerless, said, “Don’t be deceived by her name; she’s a woman.”

Chen Ping’an froze for a moment.

It couldn’t be that coincidental.

Qi Jinglong nodded, “Indeed, she’s a female, around the same age as you, with a solid foundation at the Golden Body stage.”

Seeing Chen Ping’an’s somewhat bewildered expression.

Bai Shou’s eyes lit up, “As for how she looks, I’m not certain. When you fight her, just take a few more glances. After all, fists have no eyes, hehehe…”

Then Bai Shou’s demeanor shifted dramatically, feeling a chill run down his spine. Turning rigidly, he saw a woman slowly walking into the pavilion.

She hadn’t said anything, nor did she show any displeasure, nor did she deliberately target Bai Shou. Yet, the youth keenly sensed a force that seemed to resonate with the “heaven and earth harmony” of the Sword Qi Great Wall, pressing down on him.

Perhaps she had merely shifted her thoughts slightly; if she was not pleased, then this realm would naturally not be pleased with Bai Shou either.

Bai Shou stiffly turned his head again and said to Chen Ping’an, “Make sure not to make any rash moves. When martial artists spar, they must follow the rules. Of course, it’s best not to agree to that whoever’s practice; it’s unnecessary.”

Chen Ping’an reached out to ruffle the youth’s hair, smiling, “Be careful, or I’ll twist your little head off.”

Qi Jinglong stood up, smiling, “Taihui Sword Sect’s Liu Jinglong, greetings to Miss Ning.”

Ning Yao smiled, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Liu.”

Bai Shou brushed aside Chen Ping’an’s hand on his head, feeling baffled by the way they addressed each other.

Chen Ping’an clasped his hands in his sleeves, smiling.

As for the wine flask on the bench, before his hands were fully clasped, he had secretly extended a finger to push it toward Bai Shou. This pair of master and disciple, both little wine lovers, were not doing well; they needed some advice.

Ning Yao sat beside Chen Ping’an.

Bai Shou moved over to Qi Jinglong’s side, not forgetting to take the wine flask with him as he stood up.

Ning Yao took the initiative to speak, “I traveled through Northern Julu Prefecture in my youth but never visited the Taihui Sword Sect, mostly walking around the foot of the mountain.”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “In the future, you can return to Northern Julu Prefecture with Chen Ping’an. The scenery at Piao Ran Peak is quite nice.”

Ning Yao shook her head, “It’s unlikely in the near future.”

Qi Jinglong replied, “Indeed.”

Ning Yao paused for a moment, then turned to look at the young Bai Shou.

Bai Shou instinctively straightened up in his seat.

Ning Yao remarked, “Since you are the only disciple of Mr. Liu, why aren’t you practicing swordsmanship diligently?”

Although there were the words “why” in her tone, it didn’t come across as a question.

Bai Shou, like a student caught off guard by a teacher inquiring about their homework, replied nervously, “Sister Ning, I will practice diligently!”

Ning Yao said, “Sword cultivators practicing swords must question their true hearts. When asking the sword, it is to confront one’s own incomprehension, seeking answers from the silent heavens. To teach the great Dao of heaven and earth, even if it doesn’t respond, it must respond.”

The youth felt so wronged that he didn’t dare to show it on his face, merely nodding vigorously like a little chick pecking at rice.

However, Sister Ning spoke with such a heroic spirit; after hearing her teachings, he felt like drinking wine. After drinking, he would surely practice swordsmanship diligently.

Qi Jinglong found nothing wrong with Ning Yao’s words.

If anyone else had said this, it might have seemed untimely, but at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Ning Yao guiding others in swordsmanship was akin to a sword immortal bestowing teachings. Moreover, Ning Yao was willing to speak out simply because she was sitting across from a friend of Chen Ping’an and a disciple of a friend, as both were sword cultivators.

Ning Yao stood up to take her leave, “I’ll continue my seclusion.”

Qi Jinglong rose, “I apologize for interrupting your seclusion, Miss Ning.”

Ning Yao turned to Chen Ping’an, “There are some rare wines at home; feel free to mention it to Grandpa Nalan.”

Qi Jinglong was taken aback, explaining, “Miss Ning, I don’t drink.”

Ning Yao smiled, “Mr. Liu need not be too polite. Even if the Ning Mansion runs low, apart from sword cultivators, there’s plenty of wine at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Chen Ping’an wholeheartedly agreed, nodding, “Yes, yes.”

He secretly gave Ning Yao a thumbs up.

In fact, Chen Ping’an had already written about Qi Jinglong’s preferences for alcohol in his personally penned travelogue. Ning Yao was certainly aware.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 705: One Punch Topples the Second Shopkeeper**

As Ning Yao left, Bai Shou felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted off his shoulders. Leaning against the railing, he looked at Chen Ping'an with a resentful gaze and said, "Aren't you afraid of Sister Ning? I’m nearly terrified! I wasn't even this nervous when I met the Sect Leader."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "What’s there to be afraid of? I’m just an old man; being scared of my wife would be embarrassing."

Suddenly, Qi Jinglong turned his head towards the connection between the corridor and the Dragon Slaying Cliff. 

Chen Ping'an immediately felt a tense knot in his stomach. He craned his neck to look, but Ning Yao’s figure was nowhere to be seen. He then laughed and scolded, "Qi Jinglong, you’re quite something! Now that you've become a Sword Immortal of the Fifth Realm, you’ve seen little wisdom but have gained a belly full of bad ideas!"

With a smile, Qi Jinglong replied, "Just be honest with me. How many people in the Sword Qi Great Wall actually think I’m a drunkard? Take your time to think it over and speak carefully."

Chen Ping'an asked, "How long do you think I’ve been in the Sword Qi Great Wall? Every day I’m busy practicing my punches, right? I have to constantly run to the city wall to practice swordplay with my senior brother. If I’m not careful, I’ll end up bedridden for ten or fifteen days. I need to spend a full ten hours each day refining my energy. So now, as a Qi Refining Master who's broken through to the Fifth Realm, surrounded by Sword Immortals all over the place, do I have the face to wander around? Honestly, how many people have I managed to meet this year?"

Qi Jinglong said, "You really need to explain this much?"

Chen Ping'an fell silent, realizing he might have overdone it.

Standing up, Qi Jinglong said, "I’ve long been curious about the Dragon Slaying Platform and the Seed World in Ning’s residence. I’ve already seen the Dragon Slaying Platform; let’s go check out the training grounds."

Bai Shou, puzzled, asked, "When did you see the Dragon Slaying Platform? Where is it?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "You’ve grown a little dog’s head; where are your dog’s eyes?"

Bai Shou retorted angrily, "I won’t hold it against you because of Sister Ning!"

Chen Ping'an stamped his foot, "Lower your dog head and widen your dog eyes!"

Bai Shou stood there dumbfounded, "The entire little mountain under the pavilion is the Dragon Slaying Platform?!"

Chen Ping'an had already accompanied Qi Jinglong down the Dragon Slaying Cliff, heading towards the Seed World. 

Bai Shou didn’t follow them to join the fun. What was the Seed World compared to the Dragon Slaying Platform? Initially, he had only heard that the Dragon Slaying Platform was massive, but his imagination had limited it to the size of a table. Now he never expected it to be the size of a house! At this moment, Bai Shou squatted on the ground, poking and prodding at the surface. Then, he turned his head, curled his fingers, lightly tapped, and listened for sounds. Finding none, he wiped his wrist across the ground and exclaimed, "Wow, Sister Ning's family is really wealthy!"

Walking through the Seed World with Chen Ping'an, Qi Jinglong said, "I’ve heard a lot about your deeds over at the Armory. The title of the Second Shopkeeper is known far and wide. Not just at the Sword Qi Great Wall; I heard about it even at Spring Banner Pavilion."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "Good deeds go unnoticed, while bad ones travel far and wide."

Qi Jinglong asked, "Can we speak freely here?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "General conversation; no need for restraint."

With Nalan Yexing keeping an eye on things and both parties being in the Seed World, even if a Sword Immortal were to spy, they would have to weigh the combined might of the three factions. 

Aside from Nalan Yexing, who was still at the Jade Pile level in Ning’s house, Qi Jinglong himself was a Sword Immortal at the Jade Pile level, and he had the Sect Leader Han Huaizi and the female Sword Immortal Li Cai backing him. As for Chen Ping'an, he had a senior brother stationed at the city wall, which was more than enough.

Qi Jinglong then said, "You’ve done well in three matters. Knowledge that doesn’t cost a penny is often ignored by the world; even if it’s just lying on the ground, no one cares to pick it up, and if they do, they don’t treasure it."

Chen Ping'an’s expression turned serious as he said, "Go on. As an outsider to the Sword Qi Great Wall, your analysis will be even better."

Qi Jinglong slowly elaborated, "Opening a wine shop, selling celestial wine, the focus is on couplets and horizontal banners, as well as those wall plaques that people won’t notice while drinking—everyone writes down their names and sentiments."

"Then there’s the silk shop, from the Hundred Sword Immortal Seal, to the Bi Sword Immortal Seal, and then to the folding fan."

"At the corners of the streets, there are storytellers and children sharing sunflower seeds and snacks."

After finishing his three points, Qi Jinglong began to summarize, "The wealthiest yet the most impoverished Qi Refiners in the world are Sword Cultivators. To support their swords, they pour everything into this bottomless pit, selling their pots and pans, practically going bankrupt. Occasionally, if they have spare change, in the Sword Qi Great Wall, men generally drink and gamble, while female Sword Cultivators have even less to do; they mostly buy what pleases their eyes. However, this kind of spending often doesn’t feel significant enough for women to talk about. Cheap bamboo sea cave wine, or Qingshen Mountain wine, generally allows people to drink once or twice but won’t keep them coming back, unable to compete with the big taverns for returning customers. But regardless of their intentions, as long as they hang a plaque on the wall, there will be a small, inconsequential concern in their hearts; it seems light but is actually not. Especially for those diverse Sword Immortals, how could their words on the plaques be light? The many words on those plaques are far from being casual; some Sword Immortals and Sword Cultivators are clearly leaving their last words to this world."

"If I, Qi Jinglong, were to go to that wine shop, even if it’s old tables and benches, drinking poor-quality wine, eating free noodles and pickles, or even squatting on the roadside with a drink, the true neighbors beside me would be those over a hundred Sword Immortals and Sword Cultivators' aspirations, the condensation of their lifetime of sword intent. It’s a kind of truth-telling after drinking; I hope that one day, descendants could open those plaques and know that there were once sages who passed through this world and wielded their swords here."

"Of course, once the wine shop has good business, you, the Second Shopkeeper, can naturally hear the most stories about the Sword Qi Great Wall in the most natural and inconspicuous way, allowing you to quickly advance and better understand the complex chessboard that is the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Apart from that, helping Ning Yao’s friends is now also my friends; Miss Diezhang is drawing in business. This was the initial intention, and the subsequent ideas gradually developed. The original intention and schemes are actually very close; it’s almost that one thought leads to another."

Qi Jinglong laughed, "Being able to speak so frankly, when you become a Sword Cultivator, with a heart of sword intent walking on a clear and bright path, it would be enough to earn you a spot in my Taihui Sword Sect."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Did you not advise Sect Leader Han?"

Qi Jinglong smiled bitterly, "I did, and I got scolded for my troubles. What else could I do? In fact, I wasn’t keen to persuade him; it was the Huang Tong Ancestor who urged me to convince the Sect Leader. As for what the elder seeks, I can’t refuse."

Earlier, Qi Jinglong had forgotten the wine pot on the bench, and Chen Ping'an had helped him carry it, which came in handy now as he passed it over. "According to the local saying, if a Sword Immortal doesn’t drink, the Nascent Soul should move around and drink quickly. If you’re not careful, you might accidentally break through a realm. That way, you can leverage your youth to challenge Sect Leader Han and force him to retreat back to the North Julu Prefecture. Wouldn’t that be delightful?"

Qi Jinglong took the wine pot but had no intention of drinking. He continued the previous topic, "Seals are originally served on scholars' desks, aligning best with one’s knowledge and heart. In the vast world, scholars mostly borrow others' hands, hiring many to carve seals and inscriptions. It’s rare to entrust both the seals and their inscriptions to others. Therefore, your two hundred seals, heedlessly, first came from the Hundred Sword Immortal Seal and then the Bi Sword Immortal Seal. Whether people are willing to watch or buy, it’s really about the connection. So, you are quite thoughtful. However, without the rumors and stories surrounding the wine shop, the little tidbits, it would be difficult for you to ponder the thoughts of so many Sword Immortals and Earth Immortal Sword Cultivators carefully, especially their life paths. You would never have achieved what you have now, being waited upon for the next seal, even if the inscription doesn’t resonate with your heart; it would still be cleared out. Because everyone knows that the seals from that silk shop are not expensive; if you bought ten seals and sold one, you would profit."

"So when you bind the first Bi Sword Immortal Seal into a book, you would actually be worried. You’d fear that the seals are merely a small trade in the Sword Qi Great Wall, and if a third batch of seals appeared, causing them to flood the market, it could even involve all your prior efforts in the first Bi Sword Immortal Seal. Hence, you haven’t gone all out in one direction, expending all your energy on carving the next hundred seals. Instead, you’ve taken a different route, turning to sell folding fans. The content on the fan surfaces becomes more free-spirited. This is similar to a second-rate genuine article; not only can it attract female buyers, but it also allows those who have collected seals to compare slightly and feel that the seals they bought earlier were worth holding onto."

Chen Ping'an said, "What you said is accurate. Moreover, the reason I turned to making folding fans is to hide my intentions as much as possible, to avoid being seen through by the Sword Immortals who might think I have too deep a scheme and take a dislike to me. But if it comes to this point and I’m still seen through, it doesn’t matter; after all, not everything needs to be perfect. In the end, I still need to give those Sword Immortals who have seen through my intentions a chance to laugh and scold me for being sly. Why can I not mind? Because all I hope for with my seals and folding fans is that those who obtain them from the very start are not targeting this small group of the most perceptive Sword Immortal seniors with rich life experiences. Of course, among these people, if anyone sees through the truth but doesn’t reveal it, and is even willing to receive a seal that pleases their eye, I would sincerely respect them. If the opportunity arises, I would even say to their face, 'Selling knowledge at a cheap price is a disrespect to you, the junior.'"

Qi Jinglong nodded, "Your considerations are thorough; your responses are appropriate."

Chen Ping'an patted Qi Jinglong's shoulder heavily, "No wonder you’ve been to my Broken Mountain! It wasn’t in vain! That little brat Bai Shou doesn’t compare; his comprehension is poor, and he only learned a little skin-deep. His earlier words were so stiff; he was practically a hindrance."

For the first time, Qi Jinglong actively drank a bit of wine, looking toward the wine shop. There, apart from the Sword Cultivators and alcohol, there were alleyways like Yanqi Alley and Lingxi Alley, as well as many children who had grown tired of the Sword Immortal's demeanor but knew nothing of the customs and culture of the vast world.

Qi Jinglong wiped his mouth and said solemnly, "Without a few decades, or even a hundred years of effort, what you’re doing here won’t hold much meaning."

Chen Ping'an remained silent for a long time before finally saying, "If I don’t do something, I’ll feel uncomfortable inside. It’s as simple as that; I didn’t think too much."

Qi Jinglong raised the wine pot, seemingly wanting to toast with Chen Ping'an in a grand manner.

In the end, Chen Ping'an laughed in exasperation, "I’ve put in all my skills at the wine shop, and it took a lot of effort to manage to score two pots of wine. One I gave to you, and the other was snatched away by Bai Shou. Do you think I’m some kind of deity? My abilities are not that great; can I really score three pots of wine in one go?!"

Qi Jinglong gave a "Oh" in response and chose not to drink anymore.

Qi Jinglong asked, "Earlier I heard you wanted to send a letter for Pei Qian to come to the Sword Qi Great Wall. What about Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Mili? If you don’t want the two girls to come, did you explain it well in the letter? You should know, with the personality of your great disciple, she will treat that family letter like a royal decree and won’t forget to show off to her two friends."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Of course. This is not a trivial matter."

Qi Jinglong nodded, "That’s good."

Chen Ping'an led Qi Jinglong out of the Seed World, saying, "Let me show you something."

Bai Shou had already come down from the Dragon Slaying Cliff, circling around the small mountain several times. He felt that such a large Dragon Slaying Platform warrant a painting to be done for him. Standing at the foot of the mountain, he wanted one, and sitting in the pavilion, he wanted another. Once he returned to Taihui Sword Sect and the Pienran Peak, when the scroll was unfurled, wouldn’t those heads around him draw in a breath and stare wide-eyed, all thanks to Bai Shou’s soaring reputation as a Sword Immortal? So relying on someone with the surname Liu wouldn’t do; he needed to rely on himself, and his brother Chen Ping'an was more reliable.

Seeing the two men dressed in blue robes come out of the training ground, Bai Shou followed them, heading to Chen Ping'an’s residence together.

Upon seeing the pitiful little house, Bai Shou felt a surge of sorrow within him and comforted Chen Ping'an, "Good brother, you’ve suffered."

Chen Ping'an lifted his leg.

Bai Shou ran out far away.

Feeling somewhat embarrassed himself, the youth slowly walked into the house, picking a chair that had been placed under the eaves, sitting there and acting like a lord.

Just thinking that someday a charcoal-black fellow might pop out to demand money, Bai Shou cherished his current leisurely time.

The Liu surname and his brother were discussing serious matters, not just casual chit-chat, so the youth could discern and wisely refrained from joining in.

Chen Ping'an took Qi Jinglong into a side room that had two tables. On one table, there were still unpolished jade bamboo fan ribs, as well as many blank fan surfaces without any inscriptions. There were also many unmarked plain seals, and scattered across the numerous sheets of paper were dense small characters, all drafts regarding the inscriptions and fan surfaces.

On the adjacent table was a complete topographical map of the Longquan County's dragon kilns.

Currently, many areas in Longquan County, such as Lao Ci Mountain, the Immortal Tomb, and those dragon kiln sites, were still shrouded in mist. Even when riding a celestial boat past above, one could not see the whole picture.

Qi Jinglong stood by the table, gently placing the wine pot on it, looking down. All the dragon kiln sites were not randomly arranged; they formed a long, curving line. Outside of this line, at a slight distance, there was a small circle. Qi Jinglong pointed to this area and asked, "Is that the iron lock well in the small town?"

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Qi Jinglong gazed for a moment and said, "The dragon carrying the Li Pearl ascension map."

Chen Ping'an lamented, "Good eye!"

Qi Jinglong replied nonchalantly, "I know some talisman formations; it’s not surprising."

Chen Ping'an clicked his tongue, "You say it so casually, as if it’s nothing significant. I see I’ve learned something today."

Qi Jinglong’s expression grew serious as he lightly stroked that map, squinting, "Even just looking at this map, one can still feel a surge of malice and killing intent coming at them. It seems that when the last true dragon died and vanished, it must have wished for the heavens to turn upside down and the mountains and waters to be reversed."

Chen Ping'an placed his hands in his sleeves, bending over the table.

Qi Jinglong inspected the names of the dragon kilns one by one, one hand behind his back, the other reaching out to lightly brush over the various dragon kilns, "Indeed, above the true dragon's corpse, they built the kilns at crucial acupuncture points along its spine, which is why each dragon kiln produces its destined ceramics with different innate divine abilities. The dragon gives birth to nine sons, each unique; many proverbs that have been passed down from the marketplace have great wisdom. Earlier, I wandered through Longquan Town and went to that arch bridge as well as the sword shop built by the sage Ruan Qiong by the Longxu River. That unassuming seven wells, aside from their seven-element solutions and carrying some Buddhist karma, actually resonate with the true dragon's corpse, vying for jewels. Of course, the original intention isn’t to really snatch the 'Li Pearl,' but rather to suppress and win over. It’s not that simple; originally it was a heavenly layout, countering each other, until the Li Pearl cave fell to the mortal realm, cleverly flipping over and instantly reversing the landscape. Coupled with the few western mountains chosen by the Longquan Sword Sect as the formation eyes, it properly draws in the luck into the seven wells, ultimately forming the configuration of Tian Kui and Tian Yue, left assistant and right aide. A vast amount of mountain and water luck then feeds back into the divine place where the founding master hall is located. Just saying, this arrangement of the dragon kiln actually clashes with the current geographical surveying and dragon-finding techniques; however, it can precisely use heavenly principles to suppress the geographical ones, which is indeed a monumental feat. For example, this Wenchang kiln and its neighboring Wulong kiln, according to the principles of yin and yang that are now held in high esteem in the vast world, then on your drawn map, the Wenchang kiln needs to be moved down half an inch, or the Wulong kiln needs to be shifted right an inch, to achieve the current world’s balance of civil and martial affairs. However, doing so would lose a lot of meaning. No, pulling one thread affects the whole; surely the remaining kilns would be intricately linked with these two. Is it this Chongxiao kiln? No, it should be this Gongbi kiln instead. It’s a pity that when I traveled here, I still saw it vaguely and not clearly enough. I should have taken the wind to the heights of the cloud sea, looked down from above, and taken a few more glances..."

Chen Ping'an understood every word Qi Jinglong spoke, but as for the deeper meanings, he really couldn’t grasp them. His expression was simply one of delight; Qi Jinglong, you say what you want, I’ll just listen. Even if I say a single word, it would be my loss.

Suddenly, Qi Jinglong turned and asked, "What’s your exact birth date and time? Otherwise, this game is still too difficult for me right now; the board is too large, and the principles too deep. Using you as a cutting point, I might have a chance to break the game."

Chen Ping'an placed a handful of sunflower seeds on the table, still from the wine shop, and shook his head.

Qi Jinglong frowned, "You’re already planning to break the game, so why shouldn’t I help a bit? If I were still a Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator, it would be one thing, but having stepped into the Fifth Realm, the unexpected has become much less."

Chen Ping'an cracked open a sunflower seed, laughing, "Not a chance, whether you're angry or not."

Qi Jinglong, however, was not angry. He sat down, continuing to gaze at that small, vibrant dragon map while occasionally reaching out to pinch seals, all the while flipping through the two books on the table.

While reading, Qi Jinglong casually asked, "About sending the letter?"

Chen Ping'an said, "Very safe."

Qi Jinglong then stopped asking further.

Chen Ping'an busied himself with cracking sunflower seeds. He was genuinely bored.

Later, he simply went to the adjacent table, picked up a brush, and wrote on a fan surface, "The eight winds cannot sway me; if the banner does not move, neither does my heart."

After a moment’s thought, he wrote in smaller script, like a marginal note: "All that passes through the heart returns to the heavens; all that enters the eyes, belongs to me."

Holding the fan surface, he gently blew on the ink marks, nodding, "Good characters; I’m now around nine thousand nine hundred steps away from the legendary realm of the Sage of Writing."

Qi Jinglong turned around and asked, "Do you know that girl from Water Classic Mountain, Lu?"

Chen Ping'an, puzzled, replied, "Of course I know the illustrious Lu Fairy of Water Classic Mountain; she certainly doesn’t know me. Why do you ask? Did she follow you to the Inverted Mountain? If so, I think you should just agree to her. After all, it’s not good for someone your age to be single in the Sword Qi Great Wall; even drunks and gamblers look down on bachelors."

Qi Jinglong explained, "It’s not that she followed me here. We just happened to meet at the Inverted Mountain and then came to the Sword Qi Great Wall together."

Chen Ping'an held the brush, replacing it with a fresh fan surface, intending to dig a little deeper into his inkwell. To be honest, between the seals and the fans, his half bucket of ink was running low. He lifted one hand, too lazy to engage in small talk with Qi Jinglong, "First, sort out your own thoughts before talking to me about this."

Qi Jinglong seemed to have an epiphany and nodded, saying, "So what should I do now?"

Chen Ping'an didn’t even turn around, merely focused on writing on the fan surface, and casually said, "What else can you do? It’s all about feelings and etiquette. When the girl sees you, you just meet her. Don’t look so stern; she likes you, after all, she doesn’t owe you money. After a few encounters, even if you don’t want to take the initiative to find her to avoid misunderstandings, it’s fine. But at the time of parting, regardless of who leaves the Sword Qi Great Wall first, you should take the initiative to find her once and say goodbye. You’re not interested in any particular girl right now, so you can be even more carefree. If you’re too reserved, she might overthink it."

Qi Jinglong suddenly felt enlightened.

What Chen Ping'an was writing now wasn’t as serious as the previous fan surface; it was intentionally infused with a bit more flirtation. After all, it was meant for the silk shop, and being too formal might not only be unappealing; it might not even sell. So he wrote, "The one I think of, the graceful young gentleman, is the world’s best cool breeze."

Qi Jinglong glanced at the inscription on the fan surface, speechless.

He truly wished he could take back most of the compliments he had given earlier. The fellow who had come from North Julu Prefecture, carrying burdens all the way, was clearly thinking a lot about making money!

Many thoughts in the world are connected by a thin thread, each giving rise to another. Chen Ping'an quickly penned another fan surface: "This place has been free of summer heat since ancient times; it turns out the Sword Qi has already dispelled it."

Feeling satisfied with this phrase, Chen Ping'an picked up a completed seal, opened the ink box, and gently pressed it beneath the verses. The inscription read, "Golden wind and jade dew, spring grass and green mountains, two are well matched."

This way, whether it was a woman or a man purchasing the folding fan, it would work.

Qi Jinglong chuckled, "You’re hard at work on your mind and, in the process, creating a shrewd merchant; you truly never engage in a losing deal."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Stop with your sarcastic remarks; mind your words, or you might suffer the consequences. I’ll make a bet with you: I bet Lu Fairy will give you a seal or a folding fan that I’ve inscribed. How about it?"

Qi Jinglong stood up, "I’ll be off now; I still need to go to the city wall to teach swordsmanship to the disciples of Taihui Sword Sect."

Chen Ping'an didn’t keep him back. They both stepped over the threshold, and Bai Shou was still sitting in the chair. Seeing Chen Ping'an, he raised the wine pot in his hand, and Chen Ping'an laughed, "If Pei Qian comes early and runs into you, I’ll have a word with her."

Bai Shou scoffed, "I’m not really afraid of her now. It’s just that she’s younger, started practicing late, and is a girl. How can I really go all out against her? Even if I win, I’d just look bad; it’s better not to have a second bout."

Chen Ping'an coldly chuckled, "Speak nicely."

Bai Shou immediately stood up, scampering over to Chen Ping'an’s side, both hands offering the wine pot, "Good brother, please convince Pei Qian not to fight; we shouldn’t ruin our friendship."

Chen Ping'an took the wine pot and slapped Bai Shou on the head, "Whether at the Armory or the city wall, practice your sword more and talk less. This mouth of yours is likely to provoke the flying swords of Sword Immortals."

Bai Shou shot back angrily, "Chen Ping'an, show me some respect! Aren't we speaking of seniors and juniors here?!"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Once Pei Qian arrives, if you dare to call me brother in front of her, I’ll acknowledge you as my brother. How about that?"

Bai Shou weighed the pros and cons, "Being brothers or not can wait until Pei Qian leaves."

Chen Ping'an smirked, "Look at you, so cowardly."

Bai Shou clasped his hands, forming a sword gesture, and looked up at the sky, "A real man stands tall, not engaging in a battle of wills with a young girl."

Chen Ping'an smiled, rubbing the young man’s head.

Having him accompany Qi Jinglong was pretty good; otherwise, both master and disciple would be dull and gloomy.

Chen Ping'an escorted Qi Jinglong to the entrance of Ning’s residence. As Bai Shou quickly walked down the steps, he shook his shoulders, gleefully saying, "I’m about to challenge you! One punch from you, and one punch from me!"

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, "Aren’t you going to intervene?"

Thus, Qi Jinglong said to Bai Shou, "This kind of raw truth can stay in your heart."

Qi Jinglong turned and bowed to Nalan Yexing, bidding farewell.

Seeing this, Bai Shou could only stand from afar and, together with Liu, perform a fist salute.

The master and disciple departed the city toward the Armory.

Chen Ping'an walked alongside Nalan Yexing, the elder smiling as he said, "Before the young lady entered seclusion, she asked me to convey a message to her husband: just two words—don't lose."

Chen Ping'an felt a weight off his shoulders as he said softly, "Then I know how to moderate my strength when I strike."

Regarding his and Yu Jianfu's six-realm bottleneck heights, Chen Ping'an had a clear understanding. Before reaching Lion’s Peak and having Uncle Li feed him a punch, indeed, Yu Jianfu had the upper hand. But when he broke through the bottleneck and ascended to the Golden Body Realm, he had already surpassed Yu Jianfu's six-realm martial arts.

Setting aside Cao Ci, who quietly chased after him, for other purely martial artists, as long as they were in the same realm, Chen Ping'an didn’t want to lose and couldn’t afford to lose.

As for Cao Ci, even if he lost three times, or even thirty times in the future, as long as Cao Ci was still willing to throw a punch, then Chen Ping'an would punch back without stopping, and his spirit would not wane by a single thread.

What my heart yearns for are the teachings of Mr. Qi, the intent of Cui Cheng, and the great freedom of the strong that A Liang once spoke of. Therefore, on the path of the Great Way, my only opponent is Chen Ping'an himself.

Nalan Yexing looked surprised, turning to look.

Chen Ping'an smiled and nodded, full of spirit, the intent of his punches soaring.

Then, Chen Ping'an lay on his sickbed for a full half month.

Then, on the city wall, a girl with a bun hairstyle was gnawing on a pancake. She had already sent a message to the city, clearly stating her wish to spar with Chen Ping'an three times. However, through some gossip, she heard that the Second Shopkeeper of Ning’s family had been bedridden for half a month due to illness. She was a bit shocked; could there really be such a shameless martial artist in the world?

Could it be that Cao Ci had misjudged the situation or the person? Otherwise, why would he say that among the martial artists of the same age, it was just him, Cao Ci, walking alone, with Chen Ping'an closely following, while the other Yu Jianfu was simply one of three?

The key was that as long as Cao Ci was willing to speak, he was always serious, neither offering excessive praise nor making disparaging remarks. At most, he might just say a bit more to remind Yu Jianfu to not get too cocky.

"Chen Ping'an’s resilience is particularly strong, and his martial arts are extremely steady and solid. As long as he strikes me once today, he will likely continue to dominate in future encounters. I might not be an exception, so on the path of martial arts, he will never be given the chance to walk beside me."

Yu Jianfu suddenly rose. How could a person like Chen Ping'an earn such respect from Cao Ci?!

Clearly, there were fellow martial artists openly challenging him, yet there was no response, was he saving it for later?!

Could it be that he feared the little bit of family background I, Yu Jianfu, possess? Just for this, a pure martial artist was to be restrained?!

After finishing her pancake, Yu Jianfu packed her water flask into her bag, without strapping it to her back, letting the Sword Immortal Ku Xia help keep watch. She hurried towards the northern side of the city wall, leaping up. Finally, she took a step at the edge of the city wall, her foot stepping onto the wall, and she rushed down to the ground.

At a distance of dozens of feet from the ground, she kicked heavily against the wall, shooting out like an arrow, gracefully landing on the ground and racing towards the city, her momentum like a rainbow.

It was uncertain which Sword Immortal leaked the secret first, but even before the martial artist entered the city, the various gambling houses in the city had already become bustling with business. Everyone was as excited as a chicken in a blood frenzy, compared to the betting on sparring at the Mirage; although the current betting amounts were fewer, it made everyone even more thrilled, as if it were New Year’s. Shouts of "Lock it down!" and "Big win!" and "A small fortune to be made!" were heard, the various bets rising and falling, creating a lively atmosphere. Some unscrupulous gamblers even set up bets on whether the Second Shopkeeper would win the fight and whether he would hit it off with that Yu surname girl, perhaps even catch a glimpse of romance, only to be severely reprimanded by Ning Yao.

As for the details of Yu Jianfu, they had already been thoroughly investigated by the gambling addicts who were well-fed and bored in the Sword Qi Great Wall. In short, she was not someone easy to deal with, especially that black-hearted and cunning Second Shopkeeper. They had to rely on pure punches; he would lose many underhanded tactics. Hence, the majority still bet on Chen Ping'an to win this first round, knowing that the key to winning big or small lay in the punches thrown. However, some experienced gamblers were always skeptical, wondering if the Second Shopkeeper would bet on his own loss? Wouldn’t he wipe out the entire Sword Qi Great Wall all by himself? Did they need to doubt that? Nowadays, even a roadside child would believe that the Second Shopkeeper could definitely do such a thing.

Once Yu Jianfu entered the city, the closer she got to Ning’s house street, the slower and steadier her footsteps became.

When she finally reached the street, she discovered people squatting on both sides, all watching her.

Yu Jianfu felt puzzled; was the sparring between the two pure martial artists such a big deal that so many Sword Cultivators had come to watch?

The Sword Immortal Ku Xia had told her many things, mostly helping her review the four battles Chen Ping'an had fought earlier on that street and some rumors.

Ku Xia, being someone who didn’t like to talk much, always sought to be concise when speaking with Yu Jianfu. Thus, some obscure rumors were still heard by Yu Jianfu from a girl sword cultivator named Zhu Mei.

As Yu Jianfu walked forward and stopped at the entrance of Ning’s residence, just as she was about to speak, suddenly there was a burst of laughter.

Frowning, Yu Jianfu glanced around, noticing nearly everyone was looking at a spot on the wall she had just passed. There sat a fat man, a lean boy, a one-armed woman, a handsome young man, and a young man in a blue robe who was quietly whispering with someone.

That young man slowly stood up and smiled, "I am Chen Ping'an, the one Yu girl came to spar with."

A surge of anger welled up in Yu Jianfu.

Are they mocking me, Yu Jianfu?!

Why were these Sword Cultivators all cooperating with him? Earlier, had everyone deliberately avoided looking at this Chen Ping'an?

Chen Ping'an stepped onto the street, only about twenty steps away from Yu Jianfu. One hand was behind his back, and the other was extended palm up, gently lowering twice.

Feeling the concentrated sword intent in Yu Jianfu, all extraneous thoughts disappeared. The flow of punch intent coursed through her body like a river, and she nodded toward the young martial artist in a blue robe with a white jade hairpin.

This guy before her had some martial demeanor.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Is the sparring still on?"

Yu Jianfu replied solemnly, "For this first round, shall we both give our all and exchange one punch?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "You strike first. If I can withstand it, I’ll return a punch. If I can’t, then I lose. We’ll repeat this until one of us falls down."

Yu Jianfu answered decisively, "Very well! Half a month later, we’ll have the second round, provided that you’ve recovered."

This punch was entirely her own decision.

As soon as she finished speaking, a whistle rose among the crowd.

It was apparent that the Yu family girl had waited half a month for the Second Shopkeeper and was still a bit unhappy about it.

What’s more, there was even a little girl racing along the walls of the mansions, running wildly while banging a gong, shouting, "Future master, I sneaked out to cheer you on! This gong sounds fantastic! My father will probably come for me soon, so I’ll bang for as long as I can!"

Fat Yan knocked his head back against the wall. Couldn’t this green-haired girl stop banging the gong while she spoke? Many Fifth Realm Sword Cultivators crowding around couldn’t hear a single word of what she said.

Chen Ping'an turned to look at Guo Zhujiu, smiling and nodding.

In an instant.

Yu Jianfu’s punch intent erupted.

There was a Sword Immortal destined to win a lot of money sitting on the wall, drinking bamboo sea cave wine, observing the confrontation between the two on the street. He lowered his head, letting the girl shouting "Let the Great Sword Immortal Tao Wenshan through!" land gracefully on her toes, and leap over.

After one punch.

In fact, even many Earth Immortal Sword Cultivators who had initially looked down on Yu Jianfu frowned.

That little girl really had a heavy punch.

The originally motionless Chen Ping'an was struck squarely in the chest, sent flying backward, and landed at the end of the street.

The street erupted with thunderous sounds, and aside from the immovable Nascent Soul Sword Cultivators, even the Golden Core Sword Cultivators had to use their sword energy to resist the scattering punch intent.

Chen Ping'an lay on the ground for a moment before sitting up, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth with his thumb, swaying unsteadily but still managing to stand up.

Many Sword Cultivators shouted that it was over, that the Second Shopkeeper was surely showing off and would definitely lose.

This group of people, clearly betting that the Second Shopkeeper would knock Yu Jianfu half dead and were those who often went to the wine shop to drink, had extreme trust in Chen Ping'an’s character.

But along with Chen Ping'an, everyone failed to anticipate that Yu Jianfu would turn and leave, announcing loudly, "For the first round, I concede. Half a month later, we’ll have the second round. No more rules, just free punches."

The Second Shopkeeper, who had never been at a loss in business, immediately couldn’t care about hiding things anymore and shouted, "Let’s continue with the second round, shall we?"

Yu Jianfu paused and turned her head, "Is this the scene of a martial artist sparring in your mind?"

Chen Ping'an turned and spat out a mouthful of blood, nodding solemnly, "Then let’s head to the city wall now."

Since Yu Jianfu could say this, she must have a measure of respect.

How should a pure martial artist show respect to an opponent? Naturally, only by throwing punches.

Looking into Chen Ping'an's eyes and feeling the restrained punch intent within him, especially that fleeting sense of purity, reminded her of her many punches thrown at Cao Ci at the ancient battlefield ruins in the Golden Armor Continent. She felt both familiar and strange; indeed, they were very similar yet vastly different!

"Chen Ping'an, regardless of whether you believe it or not, I hold no personal grievances against you; it’s just a spar. However, we both know that it’s not about life or death, just about victory and defeat. That kind of half-heartedness holds no meaning for both our martial arts."

Yu Jianfu inquired, "So can we disregard the rules of the Sword Qi Great Wall? As long as it’s without life or death, even if we shatter each other’s martial paths, neither will have regrets?!"

Chen Ping'an slowly rolled up his sleeves and squinted, "When we reach the city wall, you can first ask Sword Immortal Ku Xia if he dares to agree on behalf of the Yu family’s ancestors and Zhou Shenzhi. Yu Jianfu, as pure martial artists, we don’t just bury our heads in our punches without caring for the heavens and others. Even if there truly is that one punch, it certainly isn’t something today’s Yu Jianfu can offer. To speak harshly, it requires a great punch intent."

Yu Jianfu fell into silence.

Chen Ping'an’s arms trembled as his sleeves relaxed, smiling, "Only the final round remains, and I’ll be waiting at any time."

On a wall, Guo Zhujiu had already forgotten about banging the gong. He raised his elbow to wipe the sweat from his forehead, then shook his hand heavily, marveling, "So strong! My master is so strong! He doesn’t even need to use half a move to deter the enemy, destabilizing their hearts. So this is the true pinnacle of martial arts, the peak of the Great Way! Incredible, I found such an incredible master..."

Then, the little girl was pulled back home by Jian Immortal Guo Jia, who tugged her ear.

Chen Ping'an sighed inwardly.

As expected, Yu Jianfu, who had initially wanted to leave, said, "The second round hasn’t been fought yet, so there’s no hurry for the third."

Chen Ping'an was about to speak when the almost all-dazed gamblers, along with the various betting houses, had already helped the Second Shopkeeper agree. If they were to miss a round for no reason, how much money would they lose?

In the pavilion on the Dragon Slaying Cliff, Ning Yao frowned and said, "Bai Momo, why must my man help her by taking punches? Just agreeing to one match is already enough, right?"

The old woman held her young lady's hand, gently patting it, smiling softly, "What does it matter? In my dear one's eyes, there has always been only his Ning girl."

Ning Yao’s lips curled up, but she suddenly grew angry and shouted, "Bai Momo, did that guy already discuss it with you beforehand?!"

The old woman imitated her young lady when speaking with her husband, laughing, "How could that be possible?"

Ning Yao stood up and went back into seclusion.

Her seclusion seemed quite casual.

However, the old woman knew very well that the reality was thus.

This time, the young lady's seclusion sought something great.

Because she was the one and only Ning Yao of the Sword Qi Great Wall for ten thousand years.

Today, Chen Sanqiu and the others were very taciturn and did not follow into Ning’s residence.

After the door closed, Chen Ping'an covered his mouth with his hand, opening his palm, then frowned.

It seemed that for the second round of sparring atop the city wall, aside from the situation of successfully starting with divine intervention, he must strive to end it within a hundred punches. Otherwise, the odds of winning would only decrease the longer things dragged on.

Nalan Yexing said, "The young lady’s punch techniques have achieved their form; they are not to be underestimated."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "But she will still lose, even if she will certainly be a pure martial artist with incredibly quick movements, even if I can’t use the Earth Shrink Talisman at that time."

Since Chen Ping'an entered the Golden Core Realm, especially after undergoing various trials at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had actually never fully exerted himself in running. So even Chen Ping'an himself was curious about how fast he could "run."

Then, he felt a bit helpless, "But even after today, even if I win the next two rounds, there will still be rumors circulating about ‘Chen Ping'an falling after one punch’ at the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Nalan Yexing shook his head.

Chen Ping'an asked in confusion, "No way?"

Nalan Yexing laughed, "Standing still, Chen Ping'an, one punch down, the Second Shopkeeper."

Chen Ping'an halted his steps and ran toward the entrance, turning back to laugh, "Nalan Grandpa, if Ning Yao inquires, just say I went to drink."

No, he had to hurry to the wine shop and put an end to this terrible trend. 

Returning to Yu Jianfu atop the city wall, she sat cross-legged, frowning in deep thought.

Sword Immortal Ku Xia asked, "Will you still lose in the second round?"

Yu Jianfu nodded, "As long as I’m struck by that punch he used against Qi Shou, it means victory and defeat are already determined. I’m thinking of ways to break through, but it seems very difficult. My current punch and speed are still not fast enough."

Sword Immortal Ku Xia stopped speaking.

Yu Jianfu said, "Did you hear what that person said?"

Sword Immortal Ku Xia nodded. Of course, in fact, he not only didn’t use the divine means of overseeing the battlefield but also personally visited the city, although he didn’t reveal himself.

Yu Jianfu remarked, "I’ve already lost the second round."

Ku Xia asked in confusion, "Why do you say that?"

Yu Jianfu looked far towards the city, "Even in the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping'an has his senior brothers nearby, yet he can still be responsible for his own words without needing to seek approval from others. I dare to assert that they probably won’t even spectate. I, however, cannot. For example, the elder will be worried about me and will quietly leave the city wall for fear of any accidents. If I truly encounter an unexpected situation, my ancestor and Elder Sword Immortal Zhou will not care about my promise and will inevitably take action to retaliate, harboring grudges in their hearts. Even if they do not act immediately, the path of the Great Way is long, and in the future, should the opportunity arise, they will surely strike back, or even act directly. Because in their eyes, I am still a junior. Yet that Chen Ping'an, even among the great Sword Immortals, and everyone around him should be able to say some ‘harsh words.’"

Sword Immortal Ku Xia couldn't help but be puzzled, "Though the reasoning is indeed so, shouldn’t pure martial artists purely settle matters based on martial skills?"

Yu Jianfu shook her head, "It’s not that simple. Cao Ci has said that as long as one can step into the Tenth Realm, the foundation of the first layer of vigor often decides whether a martial artist can reach the legendary Eleventh Realm in this lifetime. Stepping into the realm of return early is not necessarily a good thing. In recent years, Cao Ci has been considering how to establish a foundation for this vigor realm, which is why he made such an interesting choice."

Even Sword Immortal Ku Xia, who was unwilling to concern himself with worldly disputes, felt some curiosity, "What’s so interesting about Cao Ci’s choice?"

Yu Jianfu supported her arms on her knees, "All three teachings and various schools, Cao Ci has been learning from all of them. That’s why he went to that ancient battlefield ruins to comprehend the true meanings of the various statues and then merged them into his own boxing techniques one by one."

Sword Immortal Ku Xia shook his head, "Madman."

Yu Jianfu raised an arm, pointing towards the city, "That Chen Ping'an is also quite peculiar. It may be my illusion, but even though today he didn’t throw a single punch on the street, I still feel that he and Cao Ci seem to be on the same path, yet they are actually heading in completely opposite directions towards opposing extremes."

Sword Immortal Ku Xia laughed, "Could it be that you’re overthinking it?"

Yu Jianfu’s expression was complex, "I hope so! Yet I also hope otherwise!"

On the side of the city.

Chen Ping'an arrived at the wine shop, only to find Qi Jinglong and Bai Shou seated at the same table with two ladies, with Qi Jinglong seemingly not in a good mood as he slurped on his bowl of noodles.

Raising his head, Qi Jinglong said, "Thanks to the hard work of the Second Shopkeeper, I’ve gained quite a reputation." 

Chen Ping'an laughed lightly, turning to look at the Water Classic Mountain’s Lu Fairy.

After hesitating a moment, Qi Jinglong said, "It’s all trivial matters."

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 706: Chives on the Yangchun Noodles

Lu Sui stood up, perhaps understanding her friend's temperament. As she rose, she clasped Ren Longcong's hand, not giving her a chance to sit there pretending to be deaf and mute.

With a smile, Lu Sui said, “Greetings, Young Master Chen.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Just call me the second shopkeeper, Lu Xianzi.”

Lu Sui smiled slightly, her eyes seemingly holding words she didn’t express.

Chen Pingan continued, “Then I shall call you Lu GuNiang.”

Zhang Jiazhen, who was helping at the tavern, rushed over, empty-handed, only carrying a bowl.

Lu Sui poured Chen Pingan a bowl of wine, and they lifted their bowls in a toast, not clinking them together but drinking their fill instead. 

Ren Longcong also took a sip of wine, and that was it, before she returned to sit on the long bench alongside Lu Sui.

Bai Shou held his chopsticks in both hands, stirring a mound of Yangchun noodles without eating, clicking his tongue in wonder. He then glanced sideways at Liu, silently assessing if he had learned anything. This was the skill of his brother, rich in knowledge, and of course, Lu Xianzi was also extremely wise and poised. Bai Shou even thought that if Lu Sui liked this Chen Pingan, they would be well-matched. However, if she were to pursue someone with the surname Liu, it felt akin to a celestial flower tossed into a vegetable patch, or an orchid from the valley moved to the pigsty—how inappropriate it seemed. Just as this thought crossed his mind, Bai Shou dropped his chopsticks, pressed his palms together, and solemnly murmured in his heart, Sister Ning, I was wrong, I was wrong. Lu Sui is not worthy of Chen Pingan; she is not worthy of Chen Pingan.

Previously, Ren Longcong had been observing the fight between Chen Pingan and Yu Jianfu from the end of the street with Lu Sui. They had both closely watched the duel unfold. Had it not been for Chen Pingan's final words about “having a strong fist to speak heavy words,” Ren Longcong wouldn’t have come to the tavern to drink.

In truth, Ren Longcong accepted the likes of Qi Jinglong, a person of the Dao. Her impression of Chen Pingan, sitting at the same table, was rather mediocre. It wasn’t that she looked down on Chen Pingan for selling wine, seals, and folding fans. In fact, there had been a time when she had descended the mountain for training, facing numerous dangers, with her fellow disciples—both seniors and peers—perishing, leaving her to wander the world alone, living a hard life. She didn’t resent the old wooden tables and benches in the tavern; rather, they reminded her of the hardships she had endured back then. Yet there was always something about Chen Pingan that made Ren Longcong feel uncomfortable; it was hard to articulate. Perhaps it was because he resembled the people from the Sword Qi Great Wall too much, lacking the aura of practitioners from the vast world of righteousness. Or perhaps it was the way the various sword cultivators from different factions and realms treated this second shopkeeper quite harshly, a treatment that Ren Longcong and many of her teachers couldn't even imagine. It could also be a strange atmosphere of knowing one desires something unattainable.

It could be said that Ren Longcong had no opinion about Chen Pingan, but she had no desire to become friends with him. After all, the first impression of Chen Pingan in her mind—someone whom the land-dragon Liu Jinglong regarded as a close friend—should have been graceful and imbued with an aura of immortality. 

Unfortunately, this second shopkeeper before her, aside from his attire being somewhat in line with her impression, was a great disappointment in all other aspects of his demeanor and actions.

As for how Chen Pingan viewed Ren Longcong, she frankly didn’t care.

Originally, there should have been enough space at the table, but Lu Sui and Ren Longcong still opted to sit together, as if this was the nature of close friends. Qi Jinglong didn’t think much of it, Chen Pingan couldn’t make sense of it, and Bai Shou found it quite enjoyable. Every time he went out, he had the opportunity to observe a couple of beautiful sisters.

Lu Sui chatted about Yu Jianfu, all good things about that martial woman.

Chen Pingan listened attentively, taking it all in. 

Firstly, even if Lu Sui's words reached the ears of Yu Jianfu and the Sword Immortal Ku Xia on the city walls, they wouldn’t offend them. Secondly, if Yu Jianfu had great martial talent and was a decent person, then it was only natural that the Chen Pingan who could win the first round without throwing a single punch would be even better. Thirdly, Lu Sui’s words were mixed with some intentional or unintentional hints of hidden knowledge, information from the Spring Fan Pavilion, which certainly wouldn’t be baseless rumors. It was evident that, as friends of Qi Jinglong, Lu Sui leaned towards wanting Chen Pingan to win the second match.

Ren Longcong wasn’t interested in this, her focus was on the sword cultivators drinking around her. This was the tavern of the Sword Qi Great Wall, so she couldn’t discern who among them had a higher realm.

However, back in her homeland, the world of righteousness, even in the northern region closest to the Sword Qi Great Wall, whether at the table drinking or gathering for discussions, one could tell at a glance who held a higher status and realm.

The tavern was thriving, with not enough benches for everyone. Some were willing to squat on the roadside for a drink, but Ren Longcong noticed that among those sword cultivators hunched over eating Yangchun noodles, there was one who had previously greeted and joked with them—clearly a Nascent Soul sword cultivator! A Nascent Soul sword cultivator, even in the sword-cultivating northern region, how many were there?! And here he was, squatting on the roadside without even a small stool, like a starving ghost reincarnated?

In any secular dynasty at the foot of any mountain in the vast world of righteousness, a Nascent Soul sword cultivator would be a guest of honor, someone who would be served legendary delicacies like dragon liver and phoenix marrow.

What’s more, that old sword cultivator had just seen Chen Pingan and was cursing, saying he had been swindled out of his hard-earned wife’s dowry and was now about to be swindled out of his coffin money, right?

Then, that second shopkeeper, who had been casually chatting with Lu Sui, suddenly turned to the old sword cultivator and said something dismissively. With a cold sneer, he made a gesture. As a result, the dignified Nascent Soul sword cultivator, spotting a man further down the road who had already started eating and drinking, exclaimed in realization, saying it was a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding! He merely blamed his poor gambling skills. The second shopkeeper was the most principled one; how could he swindle even half a copper coin? He only sold the most affordable celestial wine! The old man then grabbed a jug of wine, paid up, and ran off, spitting on the ground as he went, saying, “Second shopkeeper, you’ve dropped your conscience; come pick it up before a dog takes it away.” The tavern erupted in cheers, feeling utterly satisfied, and someone impulsively ordered another jug of wine.

Ren Longcong found the sword cultivators here strange, lacking shame, their behavior absurd and incomprehensible.

Chen Pingan smiled slightly, surveying the surroundings. The crowd was filled with suspicion, but after a few words were exchanged, their doubts were greatly reduced.

Can you understand my approach? 

However, the thought of having to write a poem for that old rascal again made his head ache, so he smiled at the person across from him and sincerely asked, “Jinglong, have you had any thoughts about composing poetry lately? We could discuss it.”

As for who the poem would be for afterward, whether for that old sword cultivator or inscribed on a seal or fan, did Qi Jinglong have any say in that?

Qi Jinglong smiled and replied, “I’m not good with words, so I have no thoughts. Luckily, my half-bucket of knowledge doesn’t spill.”

Chen Pingan turned to Bai Shou and said, “In the future, I suggest you encourage your master to read more.”

Bai Shou asked, “Do you think I’m a fool?”

The one with the surname Liu had read enough already; did he need to read more? With that temper of his, would he accompany Bai Shou to read? The place where Bais Shou practiced his sword, Feiyan Peak, would soon earn a reputation for being the practice ground of the great sword immortal Bai. What books were there to be read? The collection in the thatched hut belonging to the Liu family, Bai Shou felt that even if he flipped through it casually, he would never finish in his lifetime.

Chen Pingan nodded, “If not, then?”

Bai Shou jabbed with his chopsticks, threatening, “Be careful, my sword immortal powers can turn everything into flying swords!”

Qi Jinglong chuckled knowingly but used the opportunity to educate his disciple. “At the dinner table, don’t learn from certain people.”

Bai Shou happily ate his Yangchun noodles, finding the taste mediocre but acceptable enough since it was free, so he planned to eat several bowls.

Lu Sui squinted her eyes in laughter.

At this moment, Qi Jinglong was especially likable to her.

Chen Pingan said with a smile, “In my tavern, each person gets one bowl of Yangchun noodles; afterwards, I’ll have to charge. Bai Shou, the great sword immortal, isn’t that great news?”

Bai Shou looked up, mumbling, “Aren’t you the second shopkeeper?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I set the rules.”

Bai Shou was not only unoffended but also felt a bit sorry for his brother. Thinking about how Chen Pingan lived in such a vast Ning residence, yet resided in a space barely the size of a rice grain, he quietly asked, “Are you working so hard to earn money because you can’t afford the betrothal gifts? If it really comes to that, I can muster the courage to plead with Sister Ning to marry you first. If there are no betrothal gifts, there won’t be any gifts sent your way. Besides, I think Sister Ning isn’t the type to care much for betrothal gifts. You’re overthinking it. A big man wanting to marry without money is indeed unreasonable, but who told Sister Ning to choose you by accident? Honestly, if we weren’t brothers and I knew Sister Ning first, I would have advised her against it. Alas, no more talk. I rarely get to drink, and I have a thousand words, but they’re all in this bowl; you do as you wish, I’m done.”

Watching the boy who shivered after taking a sip of wine silently set his bowl on the table, Chen Pingan scratched his head. He couldn’t really wring the boy’s head off, could he? So he found himself missing his first disciple.

Sword Immortal Tao Wen squatted by the roadside, eating Yangchun noodles, still wearing that expression of sorrow he seemed to have inherited since birth. Earlier, a sword cultivator at the table wanted to give him a spot, but Tao Wen waved his hand, grabbing only the cheapest bamboo sea cave wine and a plate of pickled vegetables. After squatting down for a while, he wondered if the pickles had become a bit too salty. Fortunately, a boy soon brought him a steaming bowl of Yangchun noodles, and those few fresh green chives looked so cute and appealing that Tao Wen couldn’t bear to eat them. Each time he twirled his chopsticks to wrap the noodles, he would unintentionally push the chives aside, letting them stay a bit longer in the smaller bowl.

This time, he earned quite a bit; just from his share after splitting the profits, he’d garnered around seven or eight Gu Yu coins.

Because no one expected the second shopkeeper to defeat his opponent with a single punch.

Initially, Tao Wen hadn’t believed it, for Yu Jianfu wasn’t just a pretty face. They were martial artists engaging in a genuine exchange of blows—how could one expect a clear victor without dozens or even hundreds of punches? Yet the second shopkeeper had insisted, guaranteeing that if he couldn’t win with a single punch, he would cover all of Tao Wen’s gambling debts from this round with wine.

Tao Wen wasn’t foolish; he buried his head in his noodles, uninterested in participating in this bet. The second shopkeeper then took a step back and agreed to settle with money, but since they had previously agreed to a fifty-fifty split, he indicated that Chen Pingan would contribute an additional twenty percent, making it a seventy-thirty split. Tao Wen felt this was acceptable; he didn’t even want to haggle. If Chen Pingan truly could knock out Yu Jianfu with a single punch, he wouldn’t miss out on earnings just by making the betting table larger. To his surprise, the second shopkeeper was principled enough to say that doing business with Tao Wen, a sword immortal, meant he should earn an extra ten percent, so they settled on a sixty-forty split. Since it was free, Tao Wen nodded in agreement and said that if he lost money, he’d just smash those old tables and wouldn’t be using any flying swords.

Beside Tao Wen squatted a young gambler who sighed heavily. In this betting round, he lost utterly, but he couldn’t blame his poor judgment; he was brave enough to bet that the second shopkeeper would win within ten punches, only to find Yu Jianfu take the first punch, gaining a significant advantage, before directly admitting defeat. “You should have taken a few more punches, you bastard! Chen Pingan is in the Golden Body realm; aren’t you in the same Golden Body realm too?”

Tao Wen turned to the young boy and said, “Cheng Quan, you should gamble less in the future. Once you sit at the betting table, you can never win against the house. Even if you want to gamble, don’t expect to make a fortune from it.”

The young man had grown up with this sword immortal, being neighbors, so it could be said that Tao Wen was like an elder watching Cheng Quan grow up. Yet Tao Wen was a rather peculiar sword immortal; he had no attachment to any powerful families and often acted alone. Aside from fighting on the battlefield alongside other sword immortals, he would return to his modest ancestral home. However, even though Tao Wen was still single, his situation was actually worse than that of many who had never married. His previous wife had gone mad for many years, year after year, exhausting his spirit. When she passed, even the immortals couldn’t save her. Tao Wen seemed to take it all in stride; he rarely drank much and had never been drunk.

Cheng Quan said helplessly, “Uncle Tao, I don’t want to gamble like this either, but maintaining a flying sword isn’t easy. I’ve hit a critical bottleneck; although it won’t help me improve my realm, breaking through this bottleneck is crucial. I’ve been lacking in divine coins for so long. You see, I’ve hardly drunk alcohol or visited the mirage these past few years. I really don’t like this; it’s just that I have no other choice.”

At this point, Cheng Quan raised his head, gazing longingly toward the southern city wall, feeling melancholic. “Who knows when the next great battle will start? My talent is just average; my destined flying sword is decent, but I’m held back by my low realm. How many monsters can I slay from the city wall to earn some money? If I could break through the bottleneck, I could significantly increase the range of my flying sword’s long-range attacks, at least three or four miles. Even from the city wall, killing monsters would be faster, and with more kills, money would come in. Becoming a Golden Core sword cultivator would then be within reach. Besides, relying on just a few small Summer coins, the gap is too large; I have no choice but to gamble.”

Tao Wen asked, “Why not borrow some?”

Cheng Quan smiled bitterly, “My friends are all broke. Even those with a little spare change need it to cultivate their flying swords; the divine coins they consume daily are no small amount. I can’t bring myself to ask.”

Tao Wen took a large mouthful of Yangchun noodles, grabbed a piece of pickled vegetables, and chewed thoughtfully. “After your aunt passed, I remember I told you once, that whatever happens in the future, big or small, I can help you. Why not speak up?”

Cheng Quan grinned, “I was just hoping that one day when it comes to a fight, you could save me once. Right now, I’m just short on money. Even if I worry, it’s still a small matter; it’s better than having no life at all.”

At this point, Cheng Quan’s face turned pale, filled with guilt and anxiety, his eyes reflecting regret, as if he wanted to slap himself.

Tao Wen appeared calm and nodded. “It’s good that you can think that way.”

Cheng Quan’s mood lightened. “Besides, Uncle Tao didn’t have much money to begin with.”

Tao Wen chuckled, “That’s true.”

Tao Wen spoke in his mind, “I can introduce you to a job. I can advance you a Gu Yu coin. Are you interested? This isn’t just my idea; it’s the second shopkeeper’s. He said you have a good disposition; you look like a sincere and honest person, so you’d be suitable.”

After Cheng Quan sensed the mental ripple, he asked with confusion, “What do you mean? The tavern is hiring long-term workers? I don’t think that’s necessary; there are the Diao sisters and Zhang Jiazhen; the tavern isn’t that big, it’s sufficient. Besides, even if I wanted to help, how long would it take to gather enough money?”

Tao Wen sighed, “The second shopkeeper truly didn’t misjudge you.”

A small sword immortal enjoying Yangchun noodles alongside a young sword cultivator sipping wine had their secret conversation. Cheng Quan rubbed his face vigorously, drank deeply, and nodded vigorously. This deal was done!

Tao Wen recalled something the second shopkeeper had said earlier, using it to remind Cheng Quan. “There are rules to being a house. The betting table has its own rules. If you muddy your sense of loyalty to your friends with business, then there will be no opportunities for collaboration in the future.”

Cheng Quan nodded.

Not long after Cheng Quan left, Chen Pingan and the others also departed from the tavern. The second shopkeeper approached Tao Wen with a bowl in hand, smiling broadly. “Sword Immortal Tao, you’ve earned hundreds or even thousands of Gu Yu coins. Why are you still drinking this kind of wine? Don’t you want to show some appreciation today?”

Tao Wen thought for a moment; he was indifferent about the whole thing, just about to nod in agreement when the second shopkeeper hurriedly added through mental words, “Don’t just shout about helping to settle the bill. Just say that everyone present, regardless of how much they drink today, you, Tao Wen, will help cover half of the wine bill—just half. Otherwise, I would have wasted this trip. The novice gamblers all know we’re partners in running this tavern. But if I pretend not to know you, that won’t do either. I need to keep them uncertain, neither fully trusting nor doubting, just right. Only then can we continue running the tavern. We need these self-righteous bastards who think they’re clever to keep guessing.”

Tao Wen cursed inwardly, “What kind of nonsense is this? What are you thinking? If you’re willing to focus on sword practice, you’ll become a sword immortal in no time.”

However, Tao Wen maintained a serious demeanor and said to everyone, “Today, for the wine, I’ll pay for half of it for up to five jugs. This is my way of thanking everyone for supporting this gambling tavern. For five jugs and above, I won’t be responsible for a single coin. Get lost, if you have money, buy your own wine; if you don’t, go home and drink urine!”

Listening to Tao Wen’s words, Chen Pingan felt that he was truly a genuine sword immortal, possessing the qualities needed to run a tavern! But ultimately, it was just that he had a good eye for people.

Chen Pingan took a sip of wine and asked mentally, “So, did Cheng Quan agree?”

Tao Wen set down his bowl and called for the boy to bring another jug of wine. “You should understand why I didn’t deliberately help Cheng Quan, right?”

Chen Pingan replied, “I understand. I actually don’t really want him to leave the city wall too soon to fight; I might even prefer he stays at this awkward realm. Whether a gambler or a gambling addict, with Cheng Quan’s character, he won’t be too bad. He’s just worried daily about various trivial matters, which is still better than being dead. As for Uncle Tao’s family matters, I’ve probably heard something about it this past year even if I’ve kept my ears covered. The good and bad of the Sword Qi Great Wall is that words flow freely; no matter how big a sword immortal is, they can’t hide their affairs.”

Tao Wen waved his hand dismissively, “Let’s not talk about that; let’s drink.”

Suddenly, Tao Wen asked, “Why not just bet on yourself losing? Many gambling houses actually allow for this. If you’re ruthless, you could probably earn at least dozens of Gu Yu coins, enough to make many sword immortals who lost money go nuts.”

Chen Pingan retorted, “Ning Yao already told me not to lose. Do you think I dare to lose? For a few dozen Gu Yu coins, losing half my life is one thing, but then spending a year and a half not returning home to sleep on the floor in the tavern—what a bargain!”

Tao Wen burst into laughter, patting the young man on the shoulder. “It’s not embarrassing to be afraid of your wife; it’s quite good. Keep it up.”

Chen Pingan chuckled and clinked his bowl with Tao Wen’s.

Tao Wen sighed softly, “Chen Pingan, being too empathetic about others’ joys and sorrows isn’t a good thing.”

Chen Pingan laughed, “A person who can say such things should engage in some self-reflection and self-questioning.”

Tao Wen was taken aback, then nodded with a smile. He simply switched the topic, “I also spoke plainly with Cheng Quan about the rules of the betting table.”

Chen Pingan shook his wine bowl and said, “Being able to adhere to business rules consistently is a good thing. If one day, Cheng Quan, who always adheres to the rules, still chooses to break them for a friend, then that shows he’s someone truly worth forming a friendship with. At that time, even if you, Uncle Tao, don’t lend him money to support his cultivation, I will. To be honest, before I became the second shopkeeper, I had two well-known nicknames that echoed throughout the world of righteousness, both quite fitting—one was ‘Chen Haoren’ and the other ‘Shancai Tongzi’!”

Tao Wen pointed at Chen Pingan’s wine bowl. “Look down; do you have any face left?”

Chen Pingan lowered his head in shock. “Who is this young man who shaved his beard? Quite handsome.”

In the study of the head of the Yan family.

The chubby Yan was nervously standing at the door of the study.

Earlier, his father had heard about the boxing match outside Ning’s residence and had given Yan Zhuo a Gu Yu coin, betting on Chen Pingan to win in a single punch.

Even though Yan Zhuo had confidence in Chen Pingan, he still felt that this Gu Yu coin might be thrown away, but his father Yan Ming said it didn’t matter if he bet wrong. Therefore, after receiving the money, Yan Zhuo wanted to play it safe, so he secretly bet that a winner would be determined within three punches or ten punches. Aside from the Gu Yu coin, he also staked two small Summer coins of his own, betting that Chen Pingan would knock out that wealthy noblewoman Yu Jianfu within a hundred punches. Who would have thought that Chen Pingan and Yu Jianfu would propose such a disadvantageous arrangement for themselves, and that Yu Jianfu would directly concede after just one punch? “Damn it, you should have taken a few more punches! Chen Pingan is in the Golden Body realm; you’re also in the same Golden Body realm, aren’t you?”

Yan didn’t want to go to his father’s study, but he had no choice. The reason was simple: he had exhausted his private savings, and even if he borrowed some from his mother, he still couldn’t afford to pay back the pile of Gu Yu coins his father should have earned.

So he could only come to face the music, and it wouldn’t be surprising to receive a scolding or a beating.

Yan Ming didn’t lift his head, asking, “Did you bet wrong?”

Yan Zhuo replied with a grunt.

Yan Ming continued, “Will Chen Pingan lose in this boxing match? Will he make money running the tavern?”

Yan Zhuo replied, “He absolutely won’t. Chen Pingan doesn’t care about winning or losing in fights among cultivators. His only obsession lies in martial arts. Don’t say Yu Jianfu is of the same Golden Body realm; even if he faced a martial artist in the Transcendence realm, Chen Pingan wouldn’t willingly lose.”

Yan Ming asked, “With the Ning residence so close, and Ning Yao inside, what do you think Yu Jianfu’s mindset is? If Yu Jianfu is filled with a mindset of certainty and determination, then what does winning mean for Chen Pingan?”

Yan Zhuo shook his head, “I wasn’t sure at first. But after witnessing the conversation between Chen Pingan and Yu Jianfu, I realized that Chen Pingan doesn’t think the sparring has any benefit for him.”

Yan Ming raised his head and continued to ask, “So how can we make it so Yu Jianfu doesn’t cling to this? Have you figured out why Chen Pingan proposed that suggestion? If not, then my Gu Yu coin is truly lost. All the losses from that Gu Yu coin will be written down, and you’ll pay me back slowly. Yan Zhuo, do you really think Chen Pingan intentionally let his opponent take the first move? Do you really think Yu Jianfu, having taken the first punch, conceded on a whim? Do you believe that if Yu Jianfu cast aside his martial advantage, stood still, and took a punch from Chen Pingan, Yu Jianfu wouldn’t feel embarrassed to admit defeat in the following two rounds? Do you really believe that Bai Lian Shuang, a former ten-realm martial artist, and Nalan Yexing, a former immortal realm sword cultivator, spend their days merely watching the door or cleaning the house? As long as they can teach their son-in-law, Chen Pingan will learn everything he can, and he learns exceptionally fast. Not to mention, there are often others around to help teach him sword techniques. In this past year, you, Yan Zhuo, haven’t wasted your time, but he seems to have aged three to five years in terms of experience.”

Yan Zhuo felt wronged, “I want to spar with sword immortals too, but the chief offering of our Yan family is as proud as the heavens. He has looked down on me since I was little, and even now refuses to teach me sword techniques. I’ve begged him many times, but he refuses to pay me any mind.”

Yan Ming’s expression remained calm. “Why not come and ask me to speak up, so he teaches you sword techniques without holding back?”

Yan Zhuo turned red, choking on his words. “I don’t dare! I’m afraid you’ll scold me for being useless, just living off the family, saying things like ‘the Yan family’s young master, the pig is fattened, and the southern demon tribe only cares to collect flesh…’ These disgusting words are what our own family spreads around; you never cared back then… Why should I come here to face your wrath?” 

Yan Ming maintained his usual demeanor, not speaking.

After Yan Zhuo poured out his feelings, he turned his head to wipe away his tears.

The head of the Yan family, with his sleeves hanging empty, finally spoke, “Go tell him to teach you sword techniques, giving everything without holding back.”

Yan Zhuo replied with a sound and dashed out of the study.

In the corner of the study, a ripple appeared as an old man manifested, smiling. “Must I play the villain?”

Yan Ming smiled, “You, who collect a fortune in divine coins from me every year, shouldn’t play the villain. Should I, a father, be seen as the villain in my son’s eyes?”

The old man intended to return to the Yan family’s place of cultivation immediately, as that little chubby boy had received a holy decree and was now racing away, but he smiled and said, “The way you referred to the ‘little sword immortal offering’ was a bit improper.”

Yan Ming lightly shook his head, and a little sprite responsible for helping flip through books understood, crouched slightly, and leapt into a penholder on the table. From inside, it took out two Gu Yu coins and tossed them at the old man.

The old man pocketed the two Gu Yu coins, smiling. “That’s much better.”

Yan Ming pondered, feeling awkward, and said, “For the same sword practice results, remember to go easy.”

The old man vanished in a flash.

Yan Ming still had some words he hadn’t shared with Yan Zhuo. 

For instance, the Yan family hoped that a certain daughter, nicknamed Chives, would become a new offering. 

That originally talented young woman had left the city walls and died tragically on the southern battlefield. Her father was a sword immortal, and during that fierce battle, he had rushed in despite serious injuries but was still unable to save her. 

Afterward, the girl’s mother went mad, endlessly questioning her husband, “You are a sword immortal; why couldn’t you protect your daughter?”

A man returned to a home that was now empty without her, having asked for three bowls of Yangchun noodles from the tavern, he now placed one bowl after another on the table, taking three pairs of chopsticks, setting them out, and then began to eat his own bowl.

One of the bowls of Yangchun noodles had extra chives.

In the twilight, Chen Pingan sat on the threshold with his hands tucked into his sleeves, leaning against the door frame, watching his bustling tavern and the distant, less busy hotels.

He had heard that the noblewoman of the wealthy clan from the central lands had swaggered out of the mirage, leading to a confrontation with the sword immortal named Tao Wen from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Later, these were merely stories of others’ joys and sorrows, which could have been forgotten after a few jugs of wine and bowls of Yangchun noodles. Yet in Chen Pingan’s heart, they lingered, making the young man, far from home, think of the muddy alleyways of his hometown. Eventually, the thought made him feel so uncomfortable that he had to ask Ning Yao that question.

In the Sword Qi Great Wall, regardless of age, as long as one was a sword cultivator, they were all waiting for death, having died time and again, to the point that no one was willing to remember anyone for long.

And these bastards in the vast world of righteousness came here to preach about those baseless ethics, morals, and rules? 

Why not observe the Sword Qi Great Wall thoroughly before speaking of its merits and faults? It wasn’t as if they were being asked to gallantly face death on the city walls; it wasn’t their lives on the line. Was it so difficult to look a little deeper and think a bit more?

Young Zhang Jiazhen, taking a break from his busy work, wiped the sweat from his forehead. He unintentionally caught sight of Chen Pingan, whose head was tilted against the door frame, staring blankly ahead with an unfamiliar expression.

Chen Pingan seemed a bit sad, a bit disappointed.

 ### Chapter 707: The Student Disciples Visit the Master

In the autumn of the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were no withered parasol trees in the wind, no banana leaves fluttering in the night rain, no crows cawing over the dead lotus, nor the west wind rolling up the curtains. The mandarin ducks on the cold lakes and the osmanthus flowers floating like jade were absent as well.

Yet, the vibrant colors of the season still flourished: the trees were painted in autumn hues, the grass and foliage danced as they fell, the nights grew cooler, and the full moon bathed the city in its glow.

The world, at this moment, was in the midst of spring—the spring winds and rains penned Spring couplets, and the mountains and waters sprang forth with green. It felt like the whole realm was celebrating the arrival of spring.

At the desolate Mount Ruins in Longquan County on Baoping Isle, the season of Awakening Insects arrived. The heavens inexplicably changed their mood, transforming bright sunshine into a sky thick with clouds, followed by a torrential downpour.

Three young girls huddled together on the second-floor corridor of a bamboo tower, admiring the rain.

The girl in black had a verdant walking stick on her left and a small golden yoke on her right. As the official Right Protector of the Ancestor Hall of Mount Ruins, Zhou Mili secretly gave nicknames to the walking stick and the small yoke: “Little Right Protector” and “Little Left Protector.” However, she didn’t dare share this with Pei Qian, who was quite strict and annoying. There were times when Zhou Mili felt like giving up on their friendship.

Yet, when the two of them were at odds, it was just the beginning. Zhou Mili would start counting on her fingers, waiting for Pei Qian to come seek her out.

Chen Nuanshu felt a bit worried. It seemed that Chen Lingjun had recently made up his mind that as soon as he reached the Golden Core stage, he would immediately set off for the North Julu Isle to seek his fortune.

Pei Qian shifted her position, lying on her back with her hands crossed behind her head, propping her legs up and gently swaying them. After a moment of contemplation, she slowly moved her body, turning to face the rain curtain outside the bamboo tower. Lately, she had been feeling a bit troubled. Practicing fist techniques with the old chef, she always felt something was missing and lacked spirit. Once, in a fit of anger, she had yelled at the old chef and then, quite rudely, knocked him out with a kick. Afterwards, Pei Qian felt a bit guilty towards the old chef but was reluctant to apologize. Besides that one outburst, she had indeed spoken a bit harshly. Everything else had been the old chef's fault; when it came to sparring, he ought to hit her as hard as Old Man Cui would! After all, he wouldn’t really kill her. She was not afraid of getting beaten; she could just close her eyes and yawn a few times to start a new day. She truly didn’t understand why the old chef was so timid.

“Every time you strike, there’s no power behind it. What’s going on? Each time I brew a medicinal concoction, how much silver does it cost Master? I discussed it with Nuanshu, and according to my current training method, even if Pei Qian were over at Qilong Alley, doing business with Sister Shi Rou, even if she kept the shop open at night, the bit of loose silver she earned wouldn’t be enough to make up for it in a hundred years. So why do you hesitate like you haven’t eaten? When it comes to sparring, just put some heart into it! I always end up knocked out and sleeping anyway. I’ve endured your nonsense several times before finally losing my temper.”

That night, after awakening in the middle of the night, she ran to call the old chef to make a midnight snack, and then ate a few extra bowls of rice. The old chef should have understood this was her way of apologizing, right? He should have understood; at that time, the old chef had tied on his apron and even helped her serve dishes, clearly not acting like someone who was angry. That old chef was a bit too old and ugly, but at least he didn’t hold grudges.

An even bigger worry was that Pei Qian was concerned that her persistence in following Master Zong would upset her own master once they reached the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Pei Qian rolled her eyes as she spotted that fellow visiting the small pond behind the bamboo tower again.

The Northern Mountain Lord, Wei Bo, stood in the corridor, smiling as he asked, “Pei Qian, feeling bored lately?”

Pei Qian replied lazily, “Bored? Of course, I’m bored. I’m so bored my head hurts.”

With a light slap on the ground, she sprang up like a carp, the movement so deft that the walking stick jumped into her hands. Leaping onto the railing, she unleashed a flurry of mad sword techniques, sending countless droplets of rain splattering everywhere. Wei Bo waved his hand, not in a hurry to speak.

As Pei Qian swept her sword, she shouted, “Thunderous drums and gongs echo, heavy rain pours down like coins! Time to get rich, time to get rich!”

Mount Ruins truly lacked money, that much was indisputable.

But only this girl, who thought of herself as a financial liability, would wish for money to fall from the sky.

Wei Bo chuckled, “I have a letter here. Who wants to read it?”

Pei Qian immediately stowed her walking stick, jumped down from the railing, and waved her hand to welcome the Northern Mountain Lord, along with Zhou Mili, who was slowly getting up. Together, they bowed and chanted, “Lord Mountain Lord, your visit has brightened our humble abode; may wealth flow in!”

Wei Bo nodded with a smile, handing over the envelope. It was inscribed in small, neat characters: “To Nuanshu, read by Pei Qian, sealed by Mili,” a family letter.

Chen Nuanshu hurriedly wiped her sleeves, took the letter with both hands, carefully tore it open, and then passed the envelope to Zhou Mili. Pei Qian received the letter paper, sat cross-legged, and assumed a serious posture. The other two girls followed suit, their little heads nearly bumping together. Pei Qian turned and complained, “Mili, you’re too rough! You wrinkled the envelope! What are we going to do? If you keep being so clumsy, how will I ever trust you with important matters?”

The girl in black immediately pouted, on the verge of tears. Pei Qian laughed and reached out to pat Mili on the head, offering a few comforting words. Zhou Mili quickly brightened up.

Wei Bo leaned against the railing, gazing into the distance. The rain fell heavily, blurring the view of the world, but the scenery on their side of the corridor remained bright.

The three young girls read the letter slowly, not wanting to miss a single word. They even hoped for mentions of themselves, even just a line or two, which would bring them joy for ages.

After Pei Qian carefully read through it, Zhou Mili said, “Let’s read it again.”

Pei Qian retorted, “What a waste of breath.”

After reading it three times, she carefully put the two pages of the family letter back into the envelope, cleared her throat, and said, “Did you all see what Master wrote? He doesn’t allow you two to go to the Sword Qi Great Wall. The reasons are clear, well-founded, and beyond reproach. Now, here’s the question: do you have even a hint of resentment in your hearts? If so, you must speak up. As the head disciple of the sect, I’ll help you clear your minds.”

Chen Nuanshu smiled, “I can’t go to the Sword Qi Great Wall; it’s too far. Traveling from Mount Ruins to Longquan County only takes one night, and I’ll be back on the mountain before I know it.”

She had grown accustomed to staying in one place. Previously, she was at the Zhilin Building of the Cao Clan in the Huang Ting Kingdom, and now she was in the much larger Longquan County. Besides, she used to have to hide from people, like a thief. Now, whether in Mount Ruins or at Qilong Alley in the little town, she could walk about freely. That’s why Chen Nuanshu loved it here, especially the busyness of each day.

Zhou Mili crossed her arms and forced her face to remain serious, still unable to hide her smugness. “The Mountain Lord said I, as the Right Protector, must keep a close watch on that little pond. It’s a heavy responsibility, so I’ve moved my bedding right next to it.”

The girl in black was barely able to contain her joy at that moment.

The letter from Chen Pingan mentioned that he was at the Sword Qi Great Wall, telling various people stories about the water monster of the Silent Lake! Moreover, he apparently had a significant role in those tales, unlike many characters in novels who were killed off as soon as they made an appearance. My goodness, that was an entirely different world, something she had never even dared to dream about before.

Pei Qian replied, “This shows you both have a bit of conscience. Don’t worry, I’ll just treat it as a trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall for you. My mad sword techniques, being unmatched in the world, will surely astonish countless sword immortals over there. They’ll be so moved they’ll cry and beg to take me as a disciple. Then, I’ll only be able to sigh and shake my head, saying, ‘Sorry, I already have a master. You’ll just have to cry about it.’ For those ill-fated sword immortals, this is indeed a pathetic and lamentable story.”

Chen Nuanshu asked with a smile, “When you get to the old man’s place, would you dare speak to the sword immortals like that?”

Pei Qian replied earnestly, “Of course not! I just said that; it’s just a story.”

Zhou Mili nodded vigorously, thinking that sometimes Sister Nuanshu was a bit slow-witted, even more so than herself.

Chen Nuanshu pulled out a handful of sunflower seeds, and Pei Qian and Zhou Mili each grabbed a handful expertly. When Pei Qian glared, Zhou Mili, who thought she was being sneaky by taking a big handful, suddenly froze, her expression undeterred. It was as if Pei Qian had cast a spell on her. Gradually, she loosened her grip, letting a few seeds fall into Chen Nuanshu’s palm. Only then did Pei Qian widen her eyes again, prompting Zhou Mili to return most of the seeds, revealing that she still had quite a lot, which made her secretly happy.

Chen Nuanshu laid out a handkerchief on the ground. It didn’t matter elsewhere in Mount Ruins, but in the bamboo tower, sunflower seed shells couldn’t be littered about.

Pei Qian said, “Wei Bo, if you can’t remember those things in the letter related to you, I can remind you every day at Cloud-Peeking Mountain. Nowadays I traverse mountains and valleys like the wind!”

Wei Bo chuckled, “No need.”

Pei Qian worried, “Really no need? I’m afraid you won’t take it seriously.”

Wei Bo turned his head and teased, “Shouldn’t you be worried about how to explain to Master regarding your duel with Bai Shou?”

Pei Qian looked bewildered, “What? Who’s Bai Shou? I’ve never met that person. Wei Bo, are you dreaming? Or did I dream and forget after waking up?”

After all that fuss, the three girls had come up with such an excuse?

Wei Bo gave a thumbs up, exclaiming, “Chen Pingan will definitely believe it.”

Zhou Mili covered her mouth with her hand, leaning closer to Pei Qian’s ear, and softly claimed, “See? I told you this excuse is the most effective. Anyone would believe it. Even Wei Shan Jun isn’t a fool; he believed it, didn’t he?”

Pei Qian nodded, “I’ll give you credit for that! But we agreed to keep things clear between public and private matters—only my little ledger will record your contributions, and it has nothing to do with the Ancestor Hall of Mount Ruins.”

Zhou Mili was in a good mood today, shaking her head and chuckling, “What a joke! What contribution? We’re the best of friends!”

Wei Bo sighed, “There was once a poem that began with ‘The Vastness departs from the old barriers,’ resonating with the sage’s ‘Only after me does the Vastness have the will to return.’ Thus, it has been praised by later generations as ‘the highest note.’”

Zhou Mili frowned hard, “What does that mean?”

Pei Qian replied, “Just some flowery words to piggyback on our sunflower seeds.”

Wei Bo’s general meaning was best understood by Chen Nuanshu, but she usually didn’t speak much. Now that Pei Qian didn’t mind, she had no way to go back to studying after Master left. She had flipped through many books, finishing all the ones Master left on the first floor, and then asked Nuanshu to help her buy some. Regardless, she would memorize them first. When it came to memorizing books, Pei Qian was much better than Chen Nuanshu. She only needed to understand half of it; if she didn’t understand, she would skip over it. Pei Qian didn’t mind; sometimes she would ask the old chef a few questions when she was in a good mood. However, no matter what she said, Pei Qian always felt that if Master were here, it would be so much better. She looked down on the old chef's half-baked teachings. Over time, the old chef became a bit disheartened, often spouting nonsense about how his knowledge was no less than that of Master Zong. Pei Qian certainly didn’t believe that. One time, while cooking, the old chef deliberately added more salt.

Chen Nuanshu walked over and offered Wei Bo a handful of sunflower seeds.

Wei Bo thanked her with a big smile, taking the seeds with both hands. Then, leaning against the railing, he began to munch on the seeds, chatting leisurely with the three girls. Eventually, there was a pile of seeds in his palm and a pile of shells forming a small mountain.

Outside, the wind and rain raged.

Inside, warmth filled the air.

Wei Bo understood Chen Pingan’s thoughts. He hoped to send his two disciples, students, to the Sword Qi Great Wall sooner rather than later. If they arrived late, would the people of the Vastness ever have another chance to see the Sword Qi Great Wall? Could they still view it as a scenic spot opened up by the world of Vastness?

Even if the letter didn’t mention it, Wei Bo could sense another layer of Chen Pingan’s concern. He was somewhat uneasy about Zong Qiu, the National Master of Nanyuan, taking Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian, two children, after their travels around the lotus root blessed land. But now, with Zhu Lian practically acting as the half-master of Mount Ruins, he certainly couldn’t leave. The other three, each with their own duties and pursuits, and Wei Bo himself would certainly not leave Baoping Isle. So, in this sense, what Chen Pingan truly worried about was the lack of top-tier cultivators and martial arts grandmasters at Mount Ruins. As for the worshipper, Zhou Fei, who had already reached the realm of immortals, even if he could invite Jiang Shangzhen to come, he certainly wouldn’t bring it up.

In fact, if this letter had arrived a bit earlier, it would have been perfect. They could have traveled to Old Dragon City with Liu Jinglong from North Julu Isle, then to the Inverted Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Wei Bo began to plan, intending to see if he could enlist the elusive Cui Dongshan to help his master with his worries.

A few days later, the Cloud-Peeking Mountain received a secret message via a flying sword, requesting Zong Qiu and Pei Qian, along with Cao Qinglang, to head south first and wait for Cui Dongshan in Old Dragon City.

Then, everyone would take the intercontinental ferry together, bustling to find his master.

Upon hearing that the big white goose would be accompanying them, Pei Qian’s earlier small frustration completely evaporated.

Originally, they had planned to meet again in half a month for sparring, but Yu Jianfu unexpectedly reneged on the agreement, saying the date was to be decided later.

On this side of the city, the gamblers didn’t seem anxious at all. After all, the second shopkeeper’s gambling skills were impressive, and betting in haste could easily lead to pitfalls.

However, the seasoned old gamblers began to fret, worried that the girl Yu Jianfu might accidentally drink the second shopkeeper’s liquor, leading to a muddled head, transforming an otherwise fine spar into a farce. How would they make money then? As it looked now, not just the careless gamblers, but even many of the dealers hadn’t managed to earn a few celestial coins from Chen Pingan.

So, an old gambler, after a few drinks, lamented, “The blue surpasses the blue; our Sword Qi Great Wall's gambling tables are bound to see blood and storms in the future.”

Since there were no thatched huts to stay in, Yu Jianfu, being a woman, felt embarrassed to sleep on the ground at the city wall. Thus, like the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal, she stayed at the residence of the Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan, but she would still go back and forth to practice her fists at the city wall for hours each day. Sun Juyuan had a poor impression of the little rascals Yan Lu and Jiang Guanzheng, but he found the daughter of the Yu family from the Middle Earth quite likable. Having made a few rare appearances, she spoke on higher ground, discussing sword techniques versus boxing techniques, which made Yu Jianfu deeply grateful.

Lin Junbi, apart from going to the city wall to practice swordsmanship, spent most of her time in Sun's residence, composing music in the pavilion, diligently studying the renowned “Colorful Cloud Score.”

Lin Junbi was interested in three things: the trends in Middle Earth, cultivation, and Go. 

As for the state of affairs, Lin Junbi could only observe from the sidelines. She never slacked in her cultivation, and regarding Go, at least in the Shao Yuan Dynasty, she was already unmatched among her peers. The one she most wanted to meet was the embroidered tiger, Cui Chan.

Her senior brother preferred the Mirage so much that he often vanished without a trace.

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal never intentionally restrained that unpredictable border.

As long as one became a Golden Core sword cultivator, they would each follow their own path, moving forward and climbing higher.

Without this path, how could one achieve the Golden Core?

Among this group of sword cultivators from the Shao Yuan Dynasty, Yu Jianfu could only have decent conversations with Zhu Mei.

However, their so-called conversations were mostly Zhu Mei chattering away while Yu Jianfu listened without getting bored.

Zhu Mei even bought Yu Jianfu the thick “Bi Jian Immortal Seal Score.” Nowadays, the Sword Qi Great Wall had some relatively exquisite printings, reportedly from the Yan family. They should barely break even, but it was impossible to make too much profit.

Today, Zhu Mei was at Yu Jianfu’s place, sipping tea and watching her carefully flipping through the score. Curiously, she asked, “Sister Yu, I heard you came directly from the Golden Armor Isle to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Don’t you want to see your fiancé? Since you left your hometown, Huai Qian has become more and more famous, for instance, he’s friends with Cao Ci and Liu Youzhou. Many young female immortals from various sects are heartbroken. There are so many rumors. Are you simply against that engagement, trying to spite your elders, or have you secretly interacted with Huai Qian but just didn’t like him?”

Yu Jianfu replied, “It’s a bit of both.”

Zhu Mei then asked, “Let’s not talk about Huai Qian. What about the old Sword Immortal Zhou? It seems every time he acts, it’s quite exaggerated. Last time he intervened, it was apparently to stand up for you, right? There are even quite a few rumors saying that his intervention was too fierce, which attracted the ire of a grand maestro from the academy.”

Yu Jianfu hesitated for a moment, then shook her head, “That’s untrue.”

Zhu Mei’s eyes widened with anticipation.

Yu Jianfu explained, “Old Master Zhou has accumulated merits. As long as he doesn’t go too far, the academy generally won’t bother him. Just keep this to yourself; don’t spread it.”

Zhu Mei nodded.

Yu Jianfu reminded her, “And you should watch your mouth. If someone like Yan Lu hears of this, it could be a significant liability. Be careful.”

Zhu Mei could only nod again.

Suddenly, Zhu Mei covered her mouth and laughed.

Yu Jianfu was focused on a line in the score and didn’t notice the girl’s reaction.

“White herons stand in the snow by day, and inkstones have no lamps by night.”

Yu Jianfu glanced at this line and felt a little moved. Back then, when Cao Ci taught her fist techniques, she should have shown her gratitude, regardless of whether Cao Ci appreciated it.

Yet, she would only look at the score; she would never buy that seal or fan.

Zhu Mei couldn’t contain her curiosity any longer and, suppressing her laughter, asked, “Sister Yu, what’s the story behind your name? Is there a meaning to it?”

Yu Jianfu continued flipping through the score, shaking her head, “There’s a meaning, but it’s not interesting. I’m a girl, and since young, I’ve thought that ‘Yu Jianfu’ is an ugly name. It can’t be changed in the family tree, but I can change it freely while wandering the world. In Middle Earth, I used the alias Yu Qiyun. When I arrived at the Golden Armor Isle, I changed it again to Shi Zai Xi. You can just call me Shi Zai Xi from now on; it sounds better than Sister Yu.”

Zhu Mei playfully called out, “Zai Xi, Zai Xi!”

Yu Jianfu shook her head helplessly, continuing to read the score.

“Who’s on the city wall, worry-free?”

“Hairpin tied, clouds most abundant.”

“Drunken Immortal, poetic Buddha, sword lasting through the ages.”

There were also many paired seals: “Bow to the heavens beyond the heavens,” “The Dao illuminates the world.”

“Generously leaving,” “Vastly returning.”

“Pouring you a full cup,” “The sun and moon play in your cup.”

Yu Jianfu had flipped through the score for so long that she grew more and more irritated. Clearly, she was a knowledgeable scholar, yet she was so frivolous!

As she flipped to a page, she saw the words “Wild Goose Hits the Wall.”

Yu Jianfu thought of the towering walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall and couldn’t help but chuckle, barely suppressing her laughter and putting on a stern face.

Chen Pingan and Qi Jinglong were drinking at the shop.

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, the most wasteful thing was drinking without sincerity, relying on the magical powers of cultivators. Such people were looked down upon even more than single men.

Qi Jinglong was still just having a bowl of plain noodles and a plate of pickled vegetables.

The nearby drunkard sword cultivators exchanged glances, sharing the thought that this young sword immortal from North Julu had an unfathomable capacity for alcohol; he must have a bottomless stomach.

Perhaps it was indeed as the second shopkeeper said, reaching the level where he could sit alone at the table while everyone else lay under it.

Bai Shou loved coming here because he could drink, even though Liu had instructed him to limit himself to a bowl each time. However, his alcohol tolerance was such that even a bowl was enough to get him slightly tipsy.

Moreover, Chen Pingan had already stated, “My shop has such a large white bowl, getting drunk is quite normal; it has nothing to do with how good your alcohol tolerance is.”

Qi Jinglong hesitated, wanting to say something.

Chen Pingan smiled, “You feel that even if Lu Gu niang doesn’t say a word, your expression speaks volumes, so you’re feeling a bit anxious?”

Qi Jinglong remained silent, glancing at the wine jug, feeling a bit tempted to drink.

Chen Pingan smiled, keeping silent, pretending to be deep.

What should I do in your situation?

Meanwhile, in the Vastness, a ferry traveling from Old Dragon City to the Inverted Mountain carried two similarly clad scholars, one of whom had a beauty mark on his forehead and was dressed in white like snow. He was playing around with a girl whose slightly dark skin and walking stick made her look lively, completely lost in their own world.

The boy dashed away from the walking stick, his sleeves billowing like flying snow, and shouted, “We’re about to meet my master, your teacher! Are you happy?!”

The little girl chased after the big white goose, yelling, “So happy, so happy!”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 708: Pei Qian's Little Coin Purse

The silhouette of the Upside-Down Mountain was faintly visible on the horizon.

Cao Qinglang raised his eyes to gaze at it, disbelief evident in his voice, "Is that really a mountain-shaped seal?"

Zhong Qiu sighed, "In foreign lands, the magnificent scenery is truly abundant."

Pei Qian and Cui Dongshan sat on the railing, turning to whisper, "Those two scholars have seen less than I have. Look at me! When I see the Upside-Down Mountain, do I find it strange? Not at all! Ultimately, it's the trouble caused by just reading books and not traveling. I’m different; I’ve been copying texts non-stop and have accompanied my master across countless mountains and rivers. Has Mr. Zhong ever been to the vast Tongye Continent? Or to the Baoping Continent in the Qingluan Kingdom? Besides, I copy books every day; when it comes to copying books, apart from Sister Baoping, I consider myself the third best in the world—no one dares to claim second!"

Cui Dongshan looked puzzled, "Senior Sister seemed to drool when she saw the Upside-Down Mountain, fixated on bringing it back to Luopo Mountain. Anyone who disagrees with her, she’ll just smash their heads with this seal."

Pei Qian felt a bit embarrassed, "Who wouldn’t feel envious when seeing such a grand treasure?"

"You know, about copying books, that old cook you look down on actually has quite the skill. Back in the day, he was responsible for compiling the history books for the court. He gathered over ten renowned scholars and more than twenty enthusiastic students from the Hanlin Academy, working day and night to compile and transcribe millions of characters. Zhu Lian’s small regular script is truly exceptional; calling it divine craftsmanship wouldn’t be an exaggeration. Even the most popular styles today can’t compare to Zhu Lian’s early work. This compilation was one of the most interesting scholarly endeavors in the history of the Ouhua Blessed Land. Unfortunately, a certain old Daoist felt it was bothersome, and with a mere flick of his pinky, he incited a disaster that led to the destruction of ten to seventy percent of it—scholarly efforts and knowledge reduced to nothing."

Cui Dongshan waved his arms in boredom, reciting some trivial local history, "Just looking without recording, like floating weeds carried by the current, is inferior to those who see one and know one, see two and know two, and upon seeing three, can understand thousands. Following a systematic approach is crucial, as it stirs the vast river of time."

Pei Qian glared, "You big goose, which side are you on? Why do you keep siding with others? Should I give you a twist? I’ve now learned martial arts to a significant degree, probably on par with my master’s half success. My strikes lack any moderation; a single hit could break bones. Don’t go whining to my master later!"

As for the old cook’s knowledge and writing skills, that was another matter entirely.

Her master only needed one hand and a few words to make the old cook bow down and cook peacefully in the kitchen.

Cui Dongshan stretched out his hand, "Let me borrow a yellow talisman to stick on my forehead. I need to calm down; I’m scared to death by Senior Sister."

Pei Qian frowned, "Don’t mess around. My master said that when out and about, you should never casually display your talismans to flaunt your background. In places crowded with cultivators, it’s easy to provoke jealousy. Once someone gets jealous, it often leads to trouble. Even if you’re innocent, you could still end up in a mess. In areas where mountain spirits gather, showing off is even more provocative. This isn’t just a wild guess; back when I was with my master on Tongye Continent, we encountered a wedding ceremony of the mountain god in the desolate wilderness. I merely glanced too long, and those spirits stared me down. You won’t believe this—seeing me suffer such injustice, my master shot a glare back, and those originally haughty mountain spirits fell to the ground, begging for mercy, with even the mysterious bride in her sedan chair left unattended, likely tumbling around. To this day, I still feel a bit guilty about it."

Cui Dongshan smiled, "Now that you’ve told the truth, let’s hear a fabricated version."

Pei Qian replied, "Well, in the fake version, my master stood up and proactively apologized to the head matron of the wedding procession, sincerely congratulating them. Afterwards, he scolded me, saying that this was the second time I had made a mistake, and if I did it again, he wouldn't be polite."

Pei Qian rubbed her eyes, pretending to be serious, "Even if it’s a fake story, just thinking about it makes me sad."

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "Make sure to keep your eye boogers; don’t rub them away."

Pei Qian threw a punch that stopped just an inch from Cui Dongshan's head, retracting it and laughing, "Are you scared?"

At first, he was still, then he rolled his eyes and began to tremble, mumbling, "What a tyrannical punch; I must be severely injured inside."

Pei Qian pinched her fingers together and poked, "Freeze!"

Cui Dongshan immediately stiffened.

Pei Qian took a deep breath, realizing she needed to calm down.

Moments later, Cui Dongshan urgently said, "Senior Sister, please put away your divine powers!"

Pei Qian rested her chin on her hands, gazing into the distance, and leisurely murmured, "Don’t talk to me; you’re distracting me. I need to concentrate on thinking about my master."

After that, Cui Dongshan remained as steady as a rock, looking up at the Upside-Down Mountain. His thoughts were no longer on the mountain itself or the vast world of Haoran but on the Outer Heavens, where beings beyond comprehension awaited, their origins known only to ascended cultivators.

Not far away, Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang had already gotten used to the antics of the two.

Cao Qinglang occasionally encountered many issues with his cultivation that Zhong Qiu couldn’t help him resolve, so he would proactively ask Cui Dongshan, who would only address the matter at hand and then usher him out politely, with Cao Qinglang thanking him and taking his leave, repeating this cycle each time.

Cao Qinglang was actually among the first to sense the changes in spiritual energy after Yu Zhenyi in the Ouhua Blessed Land devoted himself to becoming an immortal. Among this small group of aspiring cultivators, Cao Qinglang undoubtedly had the talent, roots, and opportunities, so when he encountered Pei Qian for the second time, he candidly admitted that even if Pei Qian attacked him during their first reunion, he would not have succeeded. Later, at the Heart Reflection Temple beside the alley, when Cao Qinglang tried to dissuade Pei Qian from her aggressive approach, it was quite… celestial.

Zhong Qiu had taken Cao Qinglang to traverse the martial world of the Lotus Root Continent. Not to mention the ancestral hall ceremony at Luopo Mountain, it was actually their first real encounter with the vast world of Haoran, truly leaving the small world where fallen immortals often descended and arriving in the grand world known as the home to many fallen immortals. Indeed, here the Three Teachings and the Hundred Schools contended, and the texts of sages were as plentiful as the sea. Fortunately, the Northern Mountain Lord, Wei Bo, had lent Zhong Qiu a small item at the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry; otherwise, simply choosing books in Longcheng would have left Zhong Qiu in an embarrassing situation of indecision.

After returning to the capital of the Southern Garden Kingdom and preparing to leave the Ouhua Blessed Land, Zhong Qiu earnestly told Cao Qinglang one thing: "The higher the heavens and the broader the earth, the more we must remember to travel with purpose."

The reason they had to explore the Blessed Land before leaving their hometown was not only because Zhong Qiu had spent half his life confined in the capital of the Southern Garden Kingdom but also because he genuinely wanted to experience the customs of the four kingdoms. Along the way, he and Cao Qinglang had personally drawn hundreds of geomantic maps. Zhong Qiu clearly stated that the new landscape of the world would be unprecedentedly transformative, with countless cultivators ascending the mountains to seek immortals, climbing high to pursue truth, and many mountain deities and temples being established, alongside many mischievous spirits creating chaos in the world.

Your teacher, Chen Pingan, could not afford to spend too much time and energy overseeing this territory. He needed someone to share his burdens, provide counsel, and even offer a few harsh truths. Zhong Qiu then asked Cao Qinglang if, on that day, he would be willing to speak up and if he dared to do so.

The youth nodded with a smile, willing and daring.

Zhong Qiu asked again, "If you and your teacher find yourselves in disagreement, each having their own reasoning, what should you do?"

The youth replied, "One should not argue just for the sake of arguing; rather, one should learn from the other's words, finding strengths to complement weaknesses, and seek understanding from mutual encouragement. This way, in the Ouhua Blessed Land, a path for all beings to attain freedom might appear."

Zhong Qiu finally asked, "But if both your paths are destined to lead only to arguments without resolution, forcing you to choose one over the other, what then?"

Cao Qinglang answered, "Proceed while observing, and think while acting."

Zhong Qiu felt reassured, no longer questioning his heart.

Now, more of Zhong Qiu’s thoughts revolved around how they would study and learn together after leaving the Ouhua Blessed Land and the dilapidated Luopo Mountain. As for practicing Qi, Zhong Qiu wouldn’t interfere too much with Cao Qinglang’s cultivation; achieving longevity through the path of cultivation was not where Zhong Qiu excelled, so he would try to avoid dictating to Cao Qinglang.

In truth, Cao Qinglang was indeed a student worth trusting, but Zhong Qiu had never experienced the scenery of that vast world himself, and he held high hopes for Cao Qinglang, so it was natural for him to say some stern words.

In the two realms, with different sceneries but common principles, all explorations and journeys in life, whether grand or narrow in academic strategies, would face various challenges. Zhong Qiu did not believe that his limited knowledge, especially in martial arts, could provide much protection or education for Cao Qinglang in the vast world of Haoran. As a native of the Ouhua Blessed Land, apart from Ding Ying, Zhong Qiu and his former close friend Yu Zhenyi were among the few who could steadily climb from the depths of the well to its mouth, truly perceiving the vastness of heaven and earth and the heights of the Dao.

When the ferry reached the Upside-Down Mountain, Cui Dongshan led the three directly to the Lingzhi Tavern, initially reluctant to pick the four most expensive rooms, asking if there were any even pricier options, which left the female cultivator of the Lingzhi Tavern in a mix of laughter and tears. There were indeed plenty of wealthy patrons who didn’t mind spending on the Upside-Down Mountain, but few were so direct in their requests. The female cultivator managing the tavern replied with a smile, saying the only places better than their tavern on the Upside-Down Mountain were Yuan Zhou Mansion, Chunfan Pavilion, Meihua Garden, and Shui Jing Palace.

The young man clapped his hands and exclaimed, "You should have said so earlier!" He then directly took the three others and left the Lingzhi Tavern. Pei Qian was bewildered, following the big goose out the tavern door. She had actually been quite satisfied with the tavern; everything she saw hanging on the walls, laid on the floors, and worn by the woman seemed valuable. So she softly asked, "Do you know those four private residences?"

Cui Dongshan grinned, saying he didn’t know them all but had dealt with Liu Caishen of Yuan Zhou Mansion and the owner of Meihua Garden in the past. They had met, chatted amicably, celebrated with a toast, and he had to think that the other party had passed away and been reincarnated, having many such good friends in the vast world of Haoran.

Pei Qian grew even more puzzled, wondering how to mooch food and drink from them, but then Cui Dongshan led them through winding alleys and checked into the Stork Tavern!

Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang were naturally indifferent to all this.

Pei Qian was a bit annoyed at first, but when Cui Dongshan sat in her room and poured himself a cup of tea, he said, "The student’s money is the teacher’s money, and the teacher’s money is your master’s money. As a disciple, shouldn’t you save a little?"

Pei Qian’s eyes lit up immediately, realizing it was a well-connected argument—quite reasonable!

She immediately shouted, using her walking stick to happily perform a series of crazy sword techniques in her room.

Afterwards, Cui Dongshan sneakily left the Stork Tavern.

Pei Qian didn’t bother to care about him; if the big goose got bullied outside and came crying to her about it, it wouldn’t help.

After all, she was a merciless killer without feelings.

When Cui Dongshan stealthily returned to the tavern, it was already late at night. Standing in the corridor outside Pei Qian’s door, he found her still practicing her stances inside.

Pei Qian moved slowly, half-asleep, her fists twisting the almost invisible dust and moonlight around her into strange shapes.

Suddenly, the window opened by itself, and a large white figure floated down, revealing a head hanging down with its tongue out—an upside-down ghost.

Still a bit dazed, Pei Qian instinctively slapped a talisman on her forehead, stepped out, and grabbed her walking stick, using it like a sword. She jabbed at the ghost’s forehead, and with a bang, the white ghost was pushed back. Pei Qian pointed her toes, letting go of her walking stick, leapt out the window, her fists ready to strike. Of course, she intended to break through with the Iron Cavalry's formation and then determine the winner through the God’s drumbeat method. Life and death depended only on how long she, Pei Qian, could hold on, not on her opponent, because Grandpa Cui had said, "When a martial artist strikes, there should be no one in front of them."

Her movements were seamless, flowing like clouds and water, and perhaps for Pei Qian, there were no distracting thoughts, making it all the more pure.

But then she saw the yawning big goose, and Cui Dongshan looked around, "Where’s Senior Sister? Out here at this hour looking at the scenery?"

Pei Qian snapped, "What do you think you’re doing at this hour, playing tricks? If I accidentally kill you with a punch, who’s to blame?"

Cui Dongshan laughed and asked, "Is punching too fast, faster than a martial artist's thoughts, necessarily good? So who is the one throwing the punch?"

Pei Qian paused, confused, "What are you talking about?"

Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes, "I’ll go tell the master that you hit me."

Pei Qian retorted angrily, "You scared me first!"

In the end, the two reconciled and sat together on the garden wall, gazing at the full moon in the vast world of Haoran.

Cui Dongshan smiled, "I heard that the Sword Qi Great Wall is quite interesting these days. Someone even dares to say that aside from the usual figures, there’s now another Chen Pingan. What’s the difference? Does the literary path still hold any significance?"

Cui Dongshan chuckled, saying to Pei Qian, "Tomorrow, we’ll take a stroll around the Upside-Down Mountain, and the day after, we’ll head to the Sword Qi Great Wall. You’ll get to see your master then."

Pei Qian replied, "What’s so great about the Upside-Down Mountain? Let’s just go to the Sword Qi Great Wall tomorrow."

Cui Dongshan laughed, "There are so many good things at the Upside-Down Mountain. Shouldn’t we buy some gifts?"

Pei Qian thought it made sense and carefully pulled out the coin purse gifted by Aunt Gui from Longcheng, beginning to count the coins.

Cui Dongshan cradled his head in his hands, laughing, "I have money; you don’t need to take yours out."

Pei Qian meticulously counted each copper coin and silver fragment, as her current personal funds were scant, and each little coin was precious to her. So every time she counted her money, she would feel them and quietly talk to them. Hearing Cui Dongshan’s words, she didn’t lift her head, shaking it softly, "But this is for buying a gift for my master; I don’t want your immortal money."

Cui Dongshan joked, "After spending so much time with you, do you really want to part with your little coins? Once they leave your coin purse, you might never see them again in this lifetime. Aren’t you heartbroken? Aren’t you sad?"

Pei Qian picked up a snowflake coin she had privately named, raised it high, and shook it gently, saying, "What can I do? If they want to leave, then let them go. I’ll still think of them. I even have a little ledger where I write down each of their names. Even if they leave, I can still help them find students and disciples. This coin purse is like a little ancestral hall; you didn’t know, but I’ve only told my master, never shared it with Mi Li. My master even praised me for it, saying I’m quite thoughtful. So, of course, my master is the most important; I can’t lose him."

Pei Qian put away the snowflake coin and tucked the small coin purse back into her sleeve, swinging her feet, "So I’m grateful to the heavens for giving me a master."

Pei Qian thought for a moment, "But if the heavens dare to take my master back…"

At this point, Pei Qian imitated Mi Li, opened her mouth wide and let out a fierce "Roar!"

*End of Chapter*

 ### Chapter 709: The Young Second Shopkeeper

The sky was clear and the moon hung low, day and night continued their cycle, and fortunately, the world still enjoyed the gentle spring breeze.

Two disciples from the Fallen Peak Sect sat chatting on a wall, having stayed awake all night. It was hard to tell where they found so much to talk about. One was a former Qi practitioner who had nearly fallen to the bottom of his cultivation path, but was now making his way back towards the peak of the mountain. He wasn't stopping halfway; the road to immortality was long, and the path to the heavens was difficult. While some walked, others ran, and a few could gallop ahead, truly displaying their genius. The other was a slightly taller girl with fairer skin than before. Breaking through in martial arts felt as easy to her as cracking melon seeds. Even after a whole night of discussion, she remained spirited and showed no signs of fatigue.

Cui Dongshan stood on the wall, recounting ancient deities who towered above all mountains, wielding long whips that could shift mountains thousands of miles away. 

He spoke of deities who stretched out their hands to reveal the sight of the bright moon rising over the sea. 

He described another deity tirelessly running between heaven and earth, whose divine form was not revealed, but who carried the sun on their shoulders, unashamedly illuminating the world. When near, it was midday with the sun hanging high; when far away, it became the sunset, painting the skies in deep hues.

Pei Qian, however, only half-listened, letting Cui Dongshan's ramblings drift in one ear and out the other. After all, it wasn’t her master speaking; whether she paid attention or remembered was inconsequential. So, Pei Qian actually enjoyed conversing with the big white goose. It always had endless strange tales and stories to share, and importantly, it didn’t mind if she forgot them after hearing them once. Unlike the old chef, who was annoyingly persistent, always questioning her about her studies despite knowing she was diligent and owed no debts. If he had that much free time, he could have spent it making another pot of spring bamboo shoots with salted meat or cooking a plate of water celery with fragrant dried tofu.

Just thinking about it made Pei Qian salivate. Besides the chef’s signature dishes, the old man’s fried creek fish was truly a delicacy.

Before embarking on this long journey, she had specifically taken Xiao Mi Li to the creek to catch a big basket full. Then she had kept an eye on the old chef at the kitchen, insisting he put in his best effort, as the fried fish was meant for her master at the Sword Qi Great Wall. If it didn’t taste right, it would be unacceptable. In the end, Zhu Lian almost had to use six-step stances and monkey boxing forms just to satisfy Pei Qian. Later, when it came to hometown delicacies, Pei Qian initially wanted to carry them in her package to the Upside Down Mountain herself. But the journey was long and she worried they wouldn't last. When she reached the old Dragon City ferry and saw Cui Dongshan rushing over, the first thing she did was ask the big white goose to hide her small token of appreciation carefully. For this, she made a trade with it; those golden fish snacks were counted as its share. Along the way, Pei Qian found various ways to consume that portion meant for Cui Dongshan, enjoying every crunchy, tasty bite, while both the old master and Cao Xiaomu looked on enviously. Once, when she asked the old master if he wanted to try some, he, being shy, smiled and declined. So, Pei Qian assumed Cao Qinglang didn’t want any either. 

Her old chef's culinary skills were truly commendable, and she had to give him a thumbs up in sincere appreciation. However, sometimes Pei Qian felt sorry for the old chef, considering his age. After all, aging was unavoidable, and his appearance had certainly seen better days. His chess skills weren't high either, and he wasn’t particularly skilled at flattering others. So, he relied on his cooking skills; otherwise, in the busy Fallen Peak Sect, he would probably need Pei Qian to support him.

But such a situation couldn't last long. Eventually, people would look down on him. Just like her master said: if someone doesn’t possess real skills, wearing new clothes and a tall hat wouldn’t earn them respect. Even if others praised you in person, they would still laugh behind your back. In contrast, those farmers, shopkeepers, and long-term workers in the dragon kilns made a living based on their skills. Whether they lived well or poorly wouldn’t invite ridicule. Thus, Pei Qian was worried that the old chef, too buoyant in spirit, might become like Chen Lingjun, who could barely grow up. She feared he might get swept up by the nearby mountain's immortal cultivators' flattery, losing track of who he really was. So, she relayed her master's words to Zhu Lian intact, of course. Pei Qian remembered her master also mentioning that when reasoning with others, it wasn’t just about being right; one had to consider customs, atmosphere, timing, tone, and attitude. Thus, after some thought, Pei Qian called over her loyal right-hand protector, executing a skillfully orchestrated approach to shake the tree and frighten the tiger. Xiao Mi Li only needed to nod along and humbly accept; later, she could add another merit to Pei Qian's credit.

After hearing Pei Qian's counsel, the old chef expressed his gratitude, acknowledging her growth. Pei Qian felt relieved that he had understood her words.

Cui Dongshan continued to pace back and forth on the narrow wall, practicing his six-step stance. Pei Qian thought the big white goose's movements were erratic, swaying this way and that, merely a display without substance. But since it didn't practice boxing under its master, it was of little concern. Otherwise, Pei Qian might have to lecture him on the principles of boxing. 

Some matters, once done, could not be taken lightly; one must be serious or it would be truly unacceptable.

Cui Dongshan continued his stance practice while muttering to himself: “It is said that ancient cultivators could enter dreams with sincerity to see true spirits. They would circulate the three lights, with the sun and moon in harmony, directing their thoughts to the stars, illuminating with divine light, forgetting all distractions, allowing their sleeves to hide the pot of heaven. Riding the winds and clouds, they would roam freely with heaven and earth. This saying carries great meaning; all laws return to their source. Take a word from my phrase: immortals of old do not collect fees. As travelers on the road, life is like morning dew—fleeting. Life and death are vague; if one does not ascend to immortality, only through the gates of cultivation can one find the Dao. Above the head are the gods and immortals, and beneath the vast night sky, there are those sleeping in the yellow springs, never to wake. In between, there are half-dead beings, leisurely living, who bow their heads to cultivate blessings for the world.”

Pei Qian asked, “Did your master teach you that?”

Cui Dongshan halted his boxing stance and smacked his forehead, reluctant to speak.

Pei Qian sighed, “If it wasn’t said by my master, then it’s not that impressive.”

Cui Dongshan performed a standing pose, extending his fingers in a peculiar gesture, pointing at Pei Qian, “Freeze!”

Pei Qian suddenly stood still.

Then, with a cold snort, she shook her shoulders, releasing her fist's momentum, as if shattering his “immortal technique,” immediately restoring the atmosphere to normal. She crossed her arms, “Just a small trick, hardly worth mentioning.”

Cui Dongshan pretended to be astonished, taking two steps back, stammering, “You... you... who are you, which sect are you from, and how can you break my technique at such a young age?!”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “There’s no one else here. Who are we showing off to? Let’s save some energy, shall we? It’s enough.”

Cui Dongshan returned to sit beside Pei Qian, speaking softly, “If you want things to go smoothly without leaving traces, isn’t it necessary to practice? Just like our Fallen Peak Sect’s unique skill, the Mountain Shaking Fist. You can’t expect to master it without practicing hundreds of thousands of times.”

Pei Qian scoffed, “That’s different. My master said that when traveling in the world, one should be kind to others, with sincerity at the forefront!”

Once Pei Qian mentioned her master, Cui Dongshan had no retort; he knew that speaking too much would lead to trouble.

However, Pei Qian quickly added in a low voice, “Once our two masters can’t see us anymore, we’ll practice properly. Because my master also said, whether on the mountain or in the world, one must never harbor ill intentions, but always guard against others. Showing weakness can help protect oneself. Showing strength can save trouble.”

Cui Dongshan nodded in agreement, deeply convinced.

Fallen Peak Sect might lack in many aspects, but it had plenty of wisdom.

At dawn, the two masters, Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang, an old and a young, opened their windows almost simultaneously to recite the sacred texts, sitting upright and immersing themselves in their studies. Pei Qian turned to look and curled her lip in feigned disdain. Though she outwardly dismissed them, inwardly she felt a twinge of envy towards Cao Qinglang, who truly resembled her master in his dedication to study. Though it was merely a matter of degree, she found herself unable to pretend to be as studious. The texts seemed to have a peculiar relationship with her, as if they were unfriendly hosts to an unwelcome guest. 

Only a few times, approximately three instances, did the words finally resonate with her sincerity, as she would later express to Xiao Mi Li, those characters no longer “died on the battlefield of the book” but instead “jumped out of the graves, flaunting their might, scaring people away.”

Xiao Mi Li was startled, her brows knitting together in fear, so Pei Qian borrowed a talisman and placed it on her forehead. That night, Xiao Mi Li moved all her beloved novels into the warm treehouse, claiming they were pitiful creatures without legs, so she had to help them find a new home, causing a bit of confusion for the warm tree. Yet the warm tree said little, merely assisting Xiao Mi Li in guarding those well-thumbed, heavily worn books.

It was like what her master had privately said: everyone has their own book. Some write their whole lives, showing it off to everyone, filled with lofty ideals but lacking in kindness. Others may never write the word “kindness” but instead fill their pages with it, opening a scene of flourishing grass and blooming flowers, vibrant even in the harshest winter or summer.

After spending enough time with the warm tree, Pei Qian felt that its book likely contained no word for “refusal.”

The three instances of abnormality in the text occurred once during her master’s travels, and twice when Pei Qian was training at Fallen Peak, wrapping a brush in cloth and gritting her teeth to copy texts, her mind hazy, half-asleep, the characters flowed like fish, arranging themselves in formation. About this matter, she had only discussed it with her master once, before arriving at Fallen Peak. Her master hadn’t said much then, and Pei Qian, not wanting to overthink it, assumed that all diligent scholars must go through such trials. After all, she had only experienced it thrice. If she were to tell her master, he would have seen such things countless times and might just scold her for making a fuss over nothing. Chestnuts may not hurt, but they would make her lose face. Thus, Pei Qian resolved that as long as her master didn’t bring it up, she wouldn’t mention it herself.

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “What level are you at now? That Cao Qinglang is quite a challenge to converse with. The last time I saw him, he was just studying every day, and it seemed he wasn’t very focused on his cultivation. I kindly advised him, saying that the three of us are of the same generation. I’m learning boxing and swordplay, having quickly learned two unique skills from my master. There’s no need to compare ourselves. What’s there to compare? Right? But you, Cui Dongshan, are already at the Ocean Observation stage, while Cao Qinglang seems to be barely at the Cave Realm. How does that make sense? My master isn’t often around to guide him, but that’s not an excuse for Cao Qinglang’s low cultivation level, is it? He doesn’t seem motivated; he claims he will work hard, but I see he’s not doing well. I won’t gossip about this with my master, so as not to let Cao Qinglang misunderstand the intentions of martial experts or legendary swordsmen. So you really are at the Ocean Observation stage, right?”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “Not at the Ocean Observation stage.”

Pei Qian clapped her fists together, “Then what about the Cave Realm? You must have brushed shoulders with the Fifth Realm immortals, right? Never mind if it’s not; it’s understandable if you’ve been busy wandering around this whole year. I could always talk to Cao Qinglang again, letting him know you’re not at the Ocean Observation stage. I’ll be careful about your reputation since we’re closer.”

Cui Dongshan mimicked Pei Qian's tone, smiling, “Senior sister is so understanding.”

Pei Qian frowned, “Enough with the formalities; just speak plainly!”

Cui Dongshan clasped his hands behind his head, his two white sleeves cascading down like waterfalls, and in Pei Qian’s eyes, he merely looked valuable. This was all due to her master’s instructions: she was not to pry into the hearts of those close to her.

Once, a Golden Dan guest from the Northern Region was trapped beneath Cui Dongshan's sleeves for a long time, all techniques failing him, ultimately left with no choice but to wait helplessly, feeling the vastness of heaven and earth alone, nearly losing his heart to despair. Of course, in the end, the Golden Dan cultivator Song Lanqiao still benefited more from the experience, but the emotional journey in between must have been quite difficult.

In Cui Dongshan’s eyes, Pei Qian—who was not very old—still appeared to be a girl just over ten years old in height and maturity.

However, Pei Qian’s extraordinary insight and deep understanding of certain matters were far beyond what a typical girl her age would possess. 

Just like when Cui Dongshan had previously noted that Pei Qian’s punches were too fast, he would only gently remind her to think more, to slow her punches down initially. Though it might feel awkward at first and impede her martial arts progression, in the long run, it would lead to even faster punches someday, allowing her to feel more at peace with heaven and earth along with her master. Many truths could only be communicated by Cui Dongshan’s teacher to his disciple Pei Qian, but some words had to come from someone outside of Chen Pingan, spoken neither lightly nor heavily, gradually and methodically, not to rush her understanding or let abstract principles disturb her mindset.

In fact, Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang’s experience in studying was also an invisible aspect of this matter. 

Everyone treated Pei Qian with such seriousness out of a sense of duty.

Why?

At the end of the day, it was the young mountain master of Fallen Peak who cared the most. 

Beyond that, there was another significant reason: Pei Qian’s own actions and changes were worthy of the expectations and hopes that everyone had carefully nurtured for her.

Within Fallen Peak, everyone preached and safeguarded the Dao.

The young mountain master, due to family upbringing.

But in the future, Fallen Peak might not be so harmonious; the names on the family tree would continue to grow, page after page, and as the number of people increased, their hearts would inevitably become mixed. But by that time, there would be no need to worry; Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang would have grown up, needing neither their master nor their teachers to shoulder everything alone.

Today, Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang didn’t visit the Upside Down Mountain together with Cui Dongshan and Pei Qian; they separated and went their own ways.

Cui Dongshan secretly lent Zhong Qiu a piece of “Rainfall Money.” A single coin wouldn’t hinder a hero; moreover, Zhong Qiu was a scholar and martial artist from the Lotus Flower Bountiful Land, and now a genuine devotee of Fallen Peak. He was no sour scholar; governing the Southern Garden Kingdom was thriving. If not for the old man dividing the blessed land into four parts, the Southern Garden Kingdom would have already been on the brink of uniting the four nations. Zhong Qiu didn’t refuse but borrowed two more pieces of “Rainfall Money” from Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan accompanied Pei Qian directly to the Lingzhi Pavilion. However, he found Pei Qian frowning and looking troubled. Those treasures and items were indeed magnificent, and while she admired them, she realized she simply couldn’t afford them. Even after browsing every corner of the Lingzhi Pavilion, she couldn’t find a single item she could buy for herself. By the time Pei Qian reluctantly exited Lingzhi Pavilion, she hadn’t borrowed any money from Cui Dongshan, nor did he offer to lend her any. The two then headed toward the shops at the foot of the Deer Cliff.

Pei Qian immediately felt at ease, her spirits lifted. There were plenty of items here, and prices were reasonable. She was dazzled by the array of goods, many costing just a few “Snowflake Coins.”

After weighing her coin pouch, she walked with a beaming smile. If there hadn’t been so many people around, she would have showcased her crazy sword techniques to express her joy.

The streets bustled with activity, filled mostly with female practitioners from the Haoran Realm, each with unique hairstyles and clothing that left Pei Qian in awe. Some women wore towering hairstyles like green mountains, adorned with horn-like combs, while their long skirts and wide sleeves flowed like clouds. Even those who weren’t particularly beautiful appeared graceful. Others had their dark hair twisted up and formed into a bun, embellished with clustered jewels and flowers. Pei Qian watched them with envy, imagining their heads crowned with small mountains of gold and silver.

Why were there so many people in the world who were just as wealthy as herself?

In the end, Pei Qian chose two gifts. One was for her master, a renowned brush from the Central Continent known as the “Zhong Family Style” brush, perfect for small characters. The brush handle was engraved with the words, “Ancient winds, skillfully crafted, deeply profound.” It cost her one Snowflake Coin. The other was a beautifully crafted large blue porcelain pen holder, filled with similarly styled brushes. Pei Qian spent a considerable amount of time selecting just one from the bunch, and with her toes barely touching the ground, she took nearly a full incense stick to make her choice. Meanwhile, Cui Dongshan stood nearby, offering suggestions. Pei Qian ignored his chatter, focusing solely on her selection. The old shopkeeper was delighted, finding it amusing that a traveler from afar didn’t seem to be lacking money, unlike this frugal girl who counted every coin.

The second gift was a lovely letter set for her master’s wife, which cost a whopping three Snowflake Coins. It was a beautifully crafted, colorful cloud letter, flowing with colors as if it had captured the moonlight—gorgeous and captivating.

After acquiring both gifts, Pei Qian’s pouch, filled with copper coins, silver scraps, and gold pumpkin seeds, felt a little lighter, and she sighed as if losing a pillar of support. Carefully, she tucked the items away into her sleeves, knowing well that the grand celestial plate had its phases, just like the small coins in her pocket that came and went. It was a longstanding truth that couldn’t be fully satisfied. Yet Pei Qian remained unaware that the big white goose, who hadn’t helped at all, had also purchased some random items from the two shops and secretly exchanged the few Snowflake Coins it had taken from her.

Cultivators often consumed the essence of the world, refining their bones and washing their marrow, and as they grew stronger, their appearances became increasingly ethereal.

However, someone like Cui Dongshan, a young man of striking appearance, was a rare and beautiful sight wherever he went, as if he belonged to the caves of the immortals, surrounded by blooming orchids and jade trees.

Thus, he attracted many glances along the way, and for numerous mountain deities, the constraints of mundane customs meant little. When a group of female Qi practitioners brushed past Cui Dongshan, one smiled back, glancing back over her shoulder, then turned to walk a few steps away, only to look back again, increasingly captivated. She then decided to turn around and quickly approach the handsome young man, wanting to pinch his cheek. However, with a flick of his sleeve, the woman vanished from sight.

The accompanying women and their attendants were all flustered. The head guard, a Nascent Soul cultivator, blocked all the younger attendants who wanted to confront Cui Dongshan, personally stepping forward to apologize. The white-clad boy with a red birthmark on his forehead remained silent but smiling. It was only when the dark-skinned little girl with the immortal’s staff spoke that he shook his sleeve, and the street suddenly saw a woman collapse to the ground, limp. He didn’t even glance at the Nascent Soul old cultivator, bending down to gently pat the fallen woman’s cheek with a smile before continuing his stroll with the little girl.

After walking a few steps, the boy suddenly staggered, raising a hand to his forehead. “Senior sister, this overwhelming divine power, unseen in the ages, has drained too much of my spirit. I’m feeling dizzy; what should I do?”

Pei Qian wiped her forehead, quickly handing the mountain staff to the big white goose. “Then take it easy; walk slowly.”

Pei Qian intentionally slowed her pace.

But as she slowed, the big white goose did too. She had no choice but to quicken her step, moving further away from those people behind them.

The boy, holding the mountain staff, repeatedly leaned on it while secretly glancing back, beaming with a radiant smile, waving at the woman.

The woman, feeling as if her head was splitting, paled and could barely speak, her heart calm, as if a mountain had settled over her entire heart.

The old Nascent Soul cultivator was stunned, feeling helpless, realizing that this small conflict so far from the Central Continent had unintentionally drawn great trouble for their sect leader. 

Was that boy an immortal? A transcendent?

The old Nascent Soul cultivator felt bitter. Once a cultivator holds a grudge, especially against those immortal beings at the mountain peak, it isn’t an issue that can be resolved in just a few years or decades; it could take hundreds or thousands of years to untangle a grudge.

Cui Dongshan glanced at the little girl who had lent him her mountain staff. She was sweating, her body tense, and there seemed to be some guilt in her eyes.

Cui Dongshan smiled with his heart, “Senior sister, you’ve only been practicing boxing for a short time. There’s no need to worry about me. Just like my master, I’m used to running around the mountain. My actions will be measured; I can take care of myself. Even if the sky were to fall, I don’t need you to worry about me. Just focus on copying texts and practicing boxing.”

Pei Qian felt a bit down, using the means of martial artists to gather sounds into a line, speaking with little enthusiasm, “But I am my master’s first disciple! As the senior sister of Fallen Peak, I should take care of the warm tree and Xiao Mi Li. Even outside of Fallen Peak, I should display the spirit of a senior sister. If not, what’s the point of training in martial arts? It’s not just to show off…”

Cui Dongshan asked with a smile, “Why can’t you show off?”

Pei Qian was puzzled, “I’ve traveled so far with my master, and he’s never shown off.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head and laughed, “Master hopes for your journey in the martial world to be enjoyable and free. As long as you don’t get involved in major issues, feel free to be more liberated. Ideally, you’ll be met with surprises and applause everywhere you go, with people exclaiming, ‘Wow, what a skilled martial artist!’ or ‘This girl’s swordsmanship is astounding! If she weren’t from a prestigious sect, she wouldn’t be breaking the rules!’”

Just the thought of those scenes in the martial world made Pei Qian happy.

But then she thought of the Sword Qi Great Wall and became somewhat concerned, asking softly, “Once we pass the Upside Down Mountain, we’ll be in another world. I’ve heard there are countless sword cultivators there, each one greater than the last. The most formidable Qi practitioners in the world; will they bully my master as an outsider? Even though my master excels in both boxing and swordsmanship, he is just one person. If those sword cultivators band together, flooding in the hundreds or thousands, and among them are seven or eight sword immortals hidden away, would my master be overwhelmed?”

Cui Dongshan was momentarily speechless.

No matter who it was, no one could handle that.

But now, Pei Qian worried about everything, thinking of the worst-case scenario. That was a good habit she had developed, likely influenced by her master’s teachings.

She hoped it wouldn’t just be the gradual growth between the sweet spring breeze and the verdant mountains.

More often, it was a flower blooming amidst the heavy night, in muddy swamps or barren lands, blooming before dawn, before the morning light arrived.

Even if the wind and rain battered it, it would bloom again.

The greater hope was that there might be no blossoms or fruit; many lives were destined to be like small grass, yet they must still experience the spring breeze and bask under the sun.

Humanity is often like this.

Why not treat it kindly?

After experiencing the minor commotion at the foot of the Deer Cliff, Pei Qian found an excuse, insisting on taking Cui Dongshan back to the Stork and Sparrow Inn, claiming she was tired after walking. Upside Down Mountain truly lived up to its name; the mountain roads were endlessly difficult, and she needed to rest.

Cui Dongshan couldn’t tell this senior sister that he wasn’t at the Ocean Observation stage or the Cave Realm but was actually at the Jade Purity stage, could he? He couldn’t mention that his current Jade Purity cultivation was even more formidable than that of the Sword Cultivator Li Tuanjing from the Baoping Continent or the Fingered Heaven Yuan Lingdian now in the Northern Region.

The key was that even if he spoke the truth, she wouldn’t believe it.

Unless it was his master who said it, perhaps the little girl would take it to heart, and lightly say something like, “Keep up the good work; just don’t become arrogant.”

In Pei Qian’s eyes and heart, the realms of everyone outside her master didn’t necessarily hold much weight.

On the way to the Stork and Sparrow Inn, Cui Dongshan exclaimed, “Senior sister, there’s money on the ground!”

Pei Qian looked down, first scanning her surroundings, then, in a flash, she stepped on that Snowflake Coin, squatting down to pick it up with a smoothness that surpassed even her punches.

Pei Qian touched the Snowflake Coin, her eyes lighting up, “It’s the one I dropped when I left home!”

Cui Dongshan was taken aback, leaping back in shock, his face filled with disbelief, “Is there such a coincidence in this world?!”

Arriving at the corner leading to the Stork and Sparrow Inn, focused on the ground, Pei Qian indeed picked up another lonely Snowflake Coin from between the stone slabs, not realizing that it was the one she had named herself. What a significant coincidence!

Then, Pei Qian grinned widely, turning to the big white goose, cheerfully saying, “Maybe before we enter the inn, they’ll be reunited!”

Cui Dongshan asked, “Is there really such a coincidental occurrence in the world?”

Pei Qian nodded, “Of course, no story is without coincidence!”

It was unfortunate that after walking through the alley, she found no more coins or coincidences.

So, Pei Qian dragged Cui Dongshan back and forth through the alley. Even Cui Dongshan, no matter how patient, had to abandon his initial thought of secretly tossing away the coin he meant to use for some fish snacks, while Pei Qian squatted down, pulling out her pouch, holding the Snowflake Coin high, smiling, “Time to go home.”

Upon reaching the inn, Pei Qian leaned on the table, placing her three Snowflake Coins before her, asking Cui Dongshan to retrieve some golden, crispy fish snacks from nearby as a celebration, unsure if the coins had fallen from the sky or sprouted from the earth, or if they had simply run back home on their own.

While Cui Dongshan munched on the fish snacks, Pei Qian didn’t eat any.

Cui Dongshan, with his mouth full, mumbled, “Senior sister, aren’t you eating?”

Pei Qian lay her head on her arms at the table, tilting her head to gaze out the window, smiling, “I’m not hungry.”

Cui Dongshan shifted from wolfing down his food to savoring each bite.

Pei Qian continued to look out the window, softly saying, “Other than the seniors my master admires, do you know who else I’m most grateful to?”

Cui Dongshan knew but shook his head, indicating he didn’t.

Cui Dongshan was even more aware of his master, who held two unspoken “small” regrets in his heart. 

One was for the little girl in the red cotton jacket growing up, and the other was for the golden little person who seemed to have gone far away without looking back.

Such regrets might accompany them for life, yet they seemed too trivial to be discussed over drinks or in conversation.

Pei Qian slowly said, “It’s Sister Baoping, and also the master’s wife I’m going to meet soon.”

Cui Dongshan, picking up a fish snack, smiled and asked, “Why?”

Pei Qian explained, “I think everyone believes my master protected Sister Baoping and the others on their journey to study. But I know that when my master first traveled far, it was Sister Baoping who accompanied him. At that time, Sister Baoping was still a little girl, carrying a small green bamboo book box, walking together with the boy master in straw sandals, traversing those vast green mountains and rivers. That’s why I really like Sister Baoping.”

“And then, there’s the master’s wife! Without her, even if my master could still venture far, he wouldn’t have been as happy over the years. How can I put it? My master probably thinks that no matter how far he travels, if there’s always someone waiting for him, he wouldn’t feel lonely at all. Whenever he thinks of the distant place where his wife is waiting for him, it’s as if there are coins scattered all over the ground, making it impossible for him not to feel happy!”

Cui Dongshan nodded in sudden understanding, “I see. If you hadn’t said anything, I might never have realized.”

Pei Qian sat up, nodding, “Don’t feel foolish; I—besides my master—am the smartest here in Fallen Peak. Do you know why?”

Cui Dongshan held back a laugh, curious, “Please enlighten me, Senior Sister.”

Pei Qian stood up, leaning forward, beckoning, “Let me tell you a secret.”

Cui Dongshan stretched his neck, and Pei Qian playfully thumped a chestnut on his head as a reward for eating a few fish snacks.

Pei Qian sat back down, spreading her hands and assuming a serious posture, “Do you understand now?”

Cui Dongshan glanced at the remaining fish snacks on the table. Pei Qian blinked at him, saying, “Eat up. Don’t hesitate; consider it a treat from my master to you, his student. If you have no qualms, go ahead and indulge.”

In a vast land resembling the Central Continent, at the center stood a towering mountain, higher than all others.

There were no temples or shrines atop the mountain, not even a single demon tribe cultivating in seclusion, for this place had been a forbidden zone since ancient times. For thousands of years, only those at the Fifth Realm or above had the qualifications to ascend and pay their respects at the summit.

Today, a frail, stooped old man in gray clothing was leading a newly accepted disciple up the mountain to meet his “self.”

As they gradually ascended, the old man held the child’s tender hand, with his other sleeve flapping in the fierce winds of the sky.

The gray-clad elder turned to look; in the far distance, an old blind man from another region was still directing a golden-armored puppet to move mountains, and the elder shook his head.

The child, being led, looked up and asked, “Are we going to fight again?”

The elder nodded, “Because I wasn’t here before, everything has been just small skirmishes, making a fool of Chen Qingdu for millennia.”

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, the gambling tables were bustling, as two of the most notable young martial artists from the Haoran Realm were about to engage in their second match.

A woman asked about boxing, while the men, of course, were just fodder for punches, with the outcome already a foregone conclusion.

The second shopkeeper, though his character, alcohol, and gambling habits were all lacking, still had decent boxing skills.

Today, atop the city wall.

A young man in a blue shirt, adorned with a jade hairpin, not only kicked off his shoes but also rolled up his sleeves and tightened his pants.

On both sides of the city wall, a dense crowd of gamblers, big and small, squatted, and when they saw this scene, they didn’t hesitate to place bets—three punches, five punches, at most ten punches for victory.

The damned second shopkeeper was once again trying to use those dubious little rumors and this pathetic trick to swindle our money! This time, the second shopkeeper was thoroughly falling on his face; he was simply too young!

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 710: The One Who Fights, is My Master**

As dawn broke, the towering gates of the Upside Down Mountain came into view. A few steps beyond was the path leading from one world to another. Zong Qiu couldn’t help but ask, “Forgive my curiosity, but who is assisting us in our journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall? Is there any hidden peril on the return trip?”

Cui Dongshan, with a bright smile, replied candidly, “It’s the master of Chunfan Studio, the Sword Immortal Shao Yunyan, who has lent us a hand. Money can indeed open doors, so there’s no need for you to worry, Master Zong.”

Naturally, Zong Qiu was skeptical of the boy's words. To think of handing over money to Shao Yunyan from Chunfan Studio, he would first need to manage to knock on the door. However, since Cui Dongshan assured him there was no cause for concern, Zong Qiu decided to let it go. After all, both parties were currently at the Hall of the Fallen Mountain's Patriarch, and if there were any matters requiring his assistance, he hoped Cui Dongshan would be forthright about it.

Zong Qiu’s thoughts on Cui Dongshan were not unique; he noticed that Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, and the Mountain Lord Wei Bo were all similarly preoccupied with their relationship with the boy. The three of them, being the most senior members of the Fallen Mountain's lesser peaks, cared deeply about their connection with this seemingly otherworldly youth named Cui Dongshan. The reason was simple. This “youth” named Cui Dongshan harbored thoughts as deep and profound as an abyss. Zong Qiu, as a national master, had seen countless emperors, generals, and heroes across the realm. He could discern the true intentions even of those who sought immortality like Yu Zhenyi. Yet, it was this white-clad youth who played all day long with Pei Qian that seemed to carry a heart that spoke for itself. The best course of action, Zong Qiu concluded, was not to delve too deeply into this person’s mindset.

At the gate, a young Taoist boy stood, equal in rank to the Great Heavenly Lord, with a youthful face. He had stopped reading and was now staring at the four of them, unashamedly sizing them up.

The boy, who had once sent Lu Tai flying out of the incense hall with a single slap, was multitasking, directing three questions towards the four of them. Among them, he asked the same question to the Confucian-clad youth and the girl with the walking stick.

To Zong Qiu, he posed the question: “Are you willing to go to the incense hall to request a stick of incense? If the incense can be lit, you may join my sect. From now on, you might even be able to call each other brothers, but I cannot guarantee that your status will rise immediately; this must be made clear to you first.”

For ordinary cultivators of the righteous path, such words would be regarded as a great fortune.

To Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang, he inquired, “Whose disciple are you?”

And to Cui Dongshan, “Who are you?”

Zong Qiu smiled and responded through sound waves, “Thanks to the kindness of the real master, I am merely a student of Confucianism, a half-hearted martial artist, and I have no intention of pursuing the arts of the immortals.”

Cao Qinglang, calm in demeanor, replied with ripples of thought, “In the realm of righteousness, the inheritance of the sect is of utmost importance. As a junior, I cannot speak for it. I hope the real master can forgive me.”

The Taoist boy seemed unbothered by their responses, nodded knowingly, and moved on, not feeling any embarrassment.

Watching the various lives unfold at Upside Down Mountain year after year was indeed dull, but he was just looking for some unexpected entertainment.

The girl, holding a green walking stick forged from a golden bamboo whip of the Thunder Pond, remained silent, instead looking up at the sky in a show of deafness, as if she had heard the young man’s unspoken words. Slowly, she began to step away, ultimately hiding behind the white-clad youth. The Taoist boy chuckled softly to himself; his reputation at Upside Down Mountain was not bad. He had never bullied anyone, and when he did act, it was always with his modest skills.

However, the boy’s answer, wrapped in the ancient dragon’s skin, left the Taoist boy speechless. The fellow simply blurted out, “I am Dongshan.”

The Taoist boy had no interest in lingering. He lowered his head and resumed his reading as the great door swung open.

The group of four stepped forward. Pei Qian consistently kept her distance from the Taoist boy, and when the great goose moved, she stood beside it, as if pretending not to see the boy, who, in turn, acted as if he didn’t see her.

After boarding the ship at Old Dragon City, Cui Dongshan had only reminded Pei Qian of one thing: if they encountered any experts, not to look directly at them but to take a detour and avoid unnecessary trouble.

Pei Qian then asked how one would recognize a high-level expert. Cui Dongshan replied, laughing, that those who appeared shrouded in mist, their heart lakes obscured, were the ones to watch out for. Just take a glance and follow the example of Chen Lingjun, acting as if blind, then emulate the little girl pretending to be mute.

As Zong Qiu stepped onto the ground, his breath became slightly uneven, but it was nothing serious. After a few breaths, he was used to it. 

While they both belonged to the realm of pure martial artists, originating from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land and the Righteous Path, there were notable differences. As the national master, Zong Qiu had to expend considerable energy and spirit. Once the Lotus Flower Blessed Land transitioned into the Lotus Root Blessed Land, stripping away the pressure of the grand path, Zong Qiu shed the burdens of the national master, both his mindset and energy expanded. By the time he reached Upside Down Mountain, he was already a different person compared to the one who had left. Thus, within those ten years, he had effortlessly shattered the six realm bottleneck and successfully entered the Golden Body realm. Ultimately, after a significant event or stroke of fortune, Zong Qiu, now at the threshold of a new realm, took another step forward.

It seemed like a stroke of luck and opportunity, but in reality, it was the result of diligent preparation.

Cao Qinglang was the one who felt the most discomfort; his face was slightly pale, and he hid his hands in his sleeves, performing hand seals to help himself concentrate and stabilize his soul. This technique was taught to him by Mr. Lu in his early years.

Pei Qian recovered more quickly than Cao Qinglang, swaying her head, quite pleased, glancing at the slow progress Cao Qinglang had made, which filled her with concern.

Earlier, Cui Dongshan had communicated a thought to her: “I’ll tease that little brat.”

Pei Qian had warned him, “Don’t go too far.”

Cui Dongshan was the last to enter the gate, leaning back and stretching his neck, seemingly trying to see what the Taoist boy was reading.

The Taoist boy smiled and said, “On Upside Down Mountain, one of my disciples isn’t particularly friendly towards the likes of dragonlings.”

Cui Dongshan had already stepped through the gate but suddenly took a step back, asking, “What did you just say?”

The Taoist boy paused, turning his head with a frown, “What realm are you, anyway?”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “I said I’m in the Ascendance realm. Do you believe me?”

The Taoist boy shook his head.

The youth seemed to engage in this rather pointless discussion earnestly, asking, “Then why did you ask me? If I said I was in the Nascent Soul realm or the Jade Purity realm, would you believe it? Do you believe me, or do you believe yourself? How do I know if you believe in yourself or in the version of me that exists in your mind? How then should I believe which version of you is the one to trust?”

The Taoist boy was left speechless for a long while before asking, “Are you mentally ill?”

The boy, undeterred, remained in his position of leaning back, still looking playful, “If the troubles lie within the very essence of the path, what will you do? Is taking medicine useful?”

The Taoist boy was utterly at a loss for words.

The boy grinned, “You’re something else. You asked me if I was sick, and when I suggested you take medicine, you got confused?”

The Taoist boy, perplexed, replied, “Do you have a death wish?”

The youth maintained a serious demeanor, “In this world, how can one repay the creation of humanity? Ultimately, one must repay with death.”

The Taoist boy frowned, closing his book as he planned to drag the brat back to Upside Down Mountain and give him a good thrashing. He figured that once he did, any mystery regarding their respective realms would naturally be revealed. However, that person, sensing danger, made a run for it.

After a moment, he leaned back again, smiling at the Taoist boy, “That seemingly sentimental book, *Song Between Pines*, has no substance at all. That lovesick scholar ended up dead, and the woman didn’t follow him into death but instead remarried and had a bunch of chubby kids. Isn’t that annoying? And to top it off, that scholar reincarnated as the son of that woman’s son. How exquisite! Wonderful, isn’t it?”

The Taoist boy sighed, forcing a smile, “Come, let’s have a proper chat.”

Finally realizing the situation, the white-clad youth took his leave, not wanting to engage in further conversation.

As soon as the troublesome boy left, the flustered Taoist boy hurriedly turned to the last pages of the book, only to be stunned as he found an ideal conclusion: a scene of flourishing flowers and a full moon.

Cui Dongshan returned again, worry etched on his face, “I forgot to mention, this is a revised version published by unscrupulous book merchants. The original version, unaltered and unabridged, is not nearly as pleasant. But of course, such a version wouldn’t sell well, and the bookstores wouldn’t make any money off it. Don’t believe me? This edition is a reprint from the Liu family of Dunxi on Liuxia Prefecture, right? Alas, it’s not even worth viewing. You’d be better off reading the editions from Wen Guantang. If only you could get your hands on a copy of the unknown *Rouge Edition*, which has no cuts and even adds to the content where men and women meet. That would be excellent! If you have the money and the time, you should definitely buy one!”

The Taoist boy asked, “Do you have any?”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “As a distinguished master at the fifth stage, what would I want with these various editions of romantic novels?”

The Taoist boy let out a long breath, putting the book away, feeling that even looking at it was distressing. He finally got to the point, “That person, who seems to be my junior disciple, appears to have not found the roots of your background.”

The youth smiled, squinting, “Then let him stop looking. If he keeps at it, he might face divine retribution. Do you think the vast territory of Upside Down Mountain can be traversed as I do, coming and going freely between two great realms?”

The Taoist boy finally stood up.

In that instant, standing just a short distance away, the young Taoist, who was no taller than a city child, suddenly felt like a towering mountain.

Cui Dongshan waved goodbye, saying, “Don’t think about waiting for opportunities, and don’t entertain any ideas of closing the gate and letting the dogs out. My movements at the fifth stage can shake the earth, and before you can feel fear, I’ll be the first to be frightened.”

The Taoist boy was about to make an exception, planning to drag this person back to the territory of Upside Down Mountain, but unexpectedly, the Great Heavenly Lord stationed at the solitary peak suddenly said indifferently through thought, “Let him go.”

The Taoist boy turned his head, his gaze icy as he looked toward the figure atop the solitary peak, “Are you trying to block me with rules?”

The Great Heavenly Lord, whose lineage was different from the young boy’s, chuckled coldly, “Rules? I made the rules. You’ve been defying them for years. Have I ever constrained you even a little with them? It’s merely the path itself.”

The young boy was thoroughly enraged, turning around and walking away in frustration.

Suddenly, another head appeared, lamenting, “Feeling heartache from outsiders and being blocked by one’s own people, it’s infuriating, really infuriating!”

Once the Taoist boy was truly angry, he triggered an anomaly in the skies above Upside Down Mountain. The clouds roiled, waves surged on the sea, and divine beings clashed, causing countless moored boats to sway in fear, leaving everyone astonished and clueless about the cause.

The Great Heavenly Lord at the foot of the mountain, who had long since set up a small world by the great gate, calmly announced, “That’s enough.”

Only then did Cui Dongshan fully step into the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Once some trivial matters were clarified with the might of Upside Down Mountain, all difficulties ahead would naturally be met with help.

Nonetheless, Cui Dongshan remained in a bad mood.

That young Taoist, while his cultivation was not impressive, was not without notable lineage. Not to mention the Taoist boy’s master, who had deep connections with a figure of high status in Baiyu Peak. Cui Dongshan had quietly held disdain for that person for many years.

The mere thought that he could only express disdain but couldn’t immediately teach him a lesson made Cui Dongshan feel quite frustrated.

As a person who valued reason and had friends all over the world, he believed there should be no lingering grudges in the world.

Thinking again about the current realm of Cui Chan, the old scoundrel, made Cui Dongshan even more disturbed.

Thus, his expression darkened.

Pei Qian, filled with concern, asked, “Did you say something unpleasant and then got into a fight? When out and about, it’s best to bear with it if you suffer a loss.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, unusually refraining from teasing his senior sister.

In the lineage of the Culture Sage, whether it be grievances or lessons, between masters and disciples, or among brothers, whatever anyone did should remain a matter to be settled behind closed doors.

The lineage of the Culture Sage has never harmed the world for personal gain.

When did things deteriorate to the point where others could unite against him, standing high above, pointing fingers?

What did the lineage of the Culture Sage have to do with incense offerings?

Was it truly wrong to say so?

No!

Not to mention the entire world of righteousness, even among the smallest of the Baoping Continent, how many people knew just how many portraits hung in the Fallen Mountain?

Over the past century, the blame lay with Cui Chan, and certainly with me, Cui Dongshan!

It also lay with that old scholar imprisoned in the Merit Forest! And with that person who had hidden away to seek out his mother’s immortality! And with that big fool who only ate without contributing and then vanished without a trace!

If in the future, I, Cui Dongshan, the student of your old scholar, and you two, with realms and cultivation, remained utterly clueless about how to ease the burdens of our sect, what then?

Would I still be left standing alone, facing the world, proudly gazing at the heavens?

I, Cui Dongshan?

One day, as I guard the Baoping Continent, should any great calamity befall this continent, that old scoundrel cannot die for now, but Cui Dongshan can.

Pei Qian quietly asked, “What’s going on? Tell me, and I’ll help if I can. Even if I can’t help you, at least I can cheer you on.”

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Just thinking about seeing the master again makes me really happy.”

Pei Qian nodded, then seriously instructed, “But you have to save some joy for later. You can’t use it all up at once. Save a bit for tomorrow and the day after, so if you feel sad later, you can take it out and feel happy again.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly laughed, genuinely happy this time.

Because he remembered that his master was very skilled at one thing in this life: staying alive.

Cui Dongshan raised his head to look around.

The Sword Qi Great Wall was a place he had never visited before.

He heard that the person whose surname he had forgotten, whether Zuo or You, was now up on the city wall, drinking the northwestern winds every day. How could he not lose his mind drinking both sea winds and gusts? 

Just thinking about once having such a junior brother filled him with a small worry.

Cui Dongshan squinted, “Let’s go straight to the city wall! There’s bound to be excitement to watch over there.”

Pei Qian retorted, “What kind of excitement could possibly compare to my meeting with the master?!”

Cui Dongshan feigned innocence, “My master is right there, and it looks like he’s about to engage in a fight.”

Pei Qian stomped her foot, her face sulking, “What is wrong with these people, always bullying a single outsider like my master!”

Taking a deep breath, Pei Qian tightened her grip on the walking stick and took off running.

Cui Dongshan stealthily pulled out a talisman from his sleeve and turned to a senior female disciple in the sword room, smiling, “Just borrowing, just borrowing. I’m actually quite poor.”

A talisman boat materialized out of thin air.

Cui Dongshan leaned on the railing, calling out, “Senior sister, what’s going on?”

Pei Qian looked up, momentarily stunned. Was the great goose so wealthy? She leaped high, lightly tapping the railing of the boat with her walking stick, and her figure floated into the talisman boat.

As they got closer to the city wall, Pei Qian fished out a yellow talisman but hesitated for a moment before returning it to her sleeve.

Her master was right there; what was there to fear?

If her master saw, it would be fine; just a lesson on how to make chestnut cakes. But if her master’s wife saw her and believed she had done something wrong, how could she make amends?

Without uttering a word, she would just have to bow deeply to her master’s wife, but that might not suffice.

Cui Dongshan perched on the railing at the front of the boat, his legs swinging, his sleeves billowing.

The youth resembled the newest white cloud in this wild world.

Everywhere he looked, he saw sword cultivators.

The most formidable and swiftest martial artists in the world were these folks.

Pei Qian dared to poke her head just above the railing, using her hands to protect her head, trying to cover her face, while straining her eyes to search for her master’s figure atop the city wall.

That self-invented mad sword technique was still lacking; it was better to wait a bit longer to display it.

No rush, she would first get the little donkey her master had promised her, then travel through the rivers and lakes that Li Huai had traversed multiple times, saving money to buy a really good sword. During this time, she would also need to spar with that white-haired scholar a few times. No need to rush.

On the city wall.

The gambling den’s patrons stood stunned, eyes as wide as saucers.

They had seen plenty of heartless gamblers, but they had never seen a second shopkeeper as callous as this one.

Those who bet that a single punch would knock down Yu Juanzhou lost; those who bet on three or five punches lost as well. Even those who wagered on ten punches within a hundred lost terribly. Not just the gamblers but even the house kept dark faces, not showing a hint of good humor. Heaven knows where so many foolish wealthy patrons came from. There weren’t many of them, but they were all too few, yet they placed bets that Chen Ping’an would win against Yu Juanzhou after a hundred punches! And not just any bet!

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, betting on Ah Liang at least allowed the house to win some money; but now, it seemed that every time, aside from a few shifty characters, the house’s bets had all been wiped clean!

The second shopkeeper hadn’t thrown a single punch, instead allowing Yu Juanzhou’s fists to rain down, and now she had received over a hundred punches.

Yet the second shopkeeper, without an ounce of conscience, let all of the righteous beings of the world take the fall, while if they were being honest, the second shopkeeper, although she hadn’t attacked half a punch, fought elegantly. 

This young martial artist in the Golden Body realm could dodge punches and withstand blows, performing with such grace that it was almost like a Sword Immortal unsheathing their sword. Even if the patrons came to earn money, the second shopkeeper, Chen Ping’an, performed beautifully; could that be converted into cash? Could they drink their fill of the bamboo sea cave’s wine?

An old sword cultivator, having lost money, started inciting his fellow gamblers, “After this fight, let’s find a chance to wrap Chen Ping’an in a sack and beat him up, shall we?”

Someone replied helplessly, “That guy is cunning; it’s hard to say who’ll be in the sack at the end. We could pool our money together and hire a Sword Immortal to strike secretly; that would be more plausible.”

Then someone tentatively proposed, “I heard that Sword Immortal Tao Wen has recently fallen out with the second shopkeeper due to profit sharing. And Tao Wen is known to be very unyielding; why not pay him to take action? Otherwise, common Sword Immortals wouldn’t want to act for mere divine money, after all, this scoundrel second shopkeeper has a great Sword Immortal as a brother.”

Another crafty old sword cultivator chimed in, “Exactly, exactly! An immortal at the divine realm definitely won’t act, and a Nascent Soul realm would be uncertain, so it has to be a Jade Purity realm. I see Tao Wen as a simple and straightforward Jade Purity realm sword cultivator; it’s clear that he can’t stand the second shopkeeper. If we get him to take action, it could work! Besides, Tao Wen has always been low on cash; his price won’t be too high.”

Still, someone remained doubtful, “What if Tao Wen hasn’t truly fallen out with the second shopkeeper? Wouldn’t we just end up in hot water then?”

For a moment, everyone was indignant, brainstorming ways to deal with the situation. Soon, someone suggested, “Then what about the Sword Immortal Yuan Qingshu from the Baosha Continent? Baosha Continent is under the jurisdiction of the Sacred One lineage and is not on good terms with the second shopkeeper. Would that work? Might it be more stable than Tao Wen? Isn’t it said that Yuan Qingshu dislikes the tavern for cheating?”

“Yuan Qingshu is probably still uncertain; I think Gao Kui is pretty good; his relationship with Pang Yuanji is solid, so he’s likely been irritated by the second shopkeeper for some time.”

Suddenly, someone lamented, “Heaven knows if this is yet another trap waiting for us to fall into!”

Others sighed, gritting their teeth, “This is unbearable. Now, every time I walk down the street, I see someone who looks like the heartless second shopkeeper!”

The rest of the crowd fell silent.

Aside from the last person who spoke the truth and those who were just stirring the pot, at least half of those who offered suggestions were indeed in league with the second shopkeeper.

On the city wall, Chen Ping’an remained calm and collected, dodging and evading, only recently blocking Yu Juanzhou’s punches.

He had taken over a hundred punches without landing a single one.

This was Chen Ping’an’s original intention.

Simultaneously, he was also estimating the speed and power of the punches from other martial artists in the world, especially beyond Cao Ci.

At the same time, Chen Ping’an was carefully checking his own punching intent, patching any gaps. Though seemingly erratic, it was actually a deliberate rhythm, free and easy, all within his control.

Thus, the moment Yu Juanzhou stopped hiding her strength and unleashed her fastest punch, successfully landing the first punch on Chen Ping’an, that would mark the true beginning of Chen Ping’an’s counterattack.

With the same speed, he would return the most powerful punch.

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were no taboos in action, nor were there any hindrances to one’s heart. 

Fighting against Yu Juanzhou was different from the previous exchanges with Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji, where he had to tread carefully, seeking a small victory by not losing. This time, with the complexity of the situation and both being outsiders as well as pure martial artists, Chen Ping’an had no need to overthink.

Just like he had told Nalan Yexing earlier, he himself was quite curious about how fast he could punch when faced with an opponent, with his intent reaching its peak.

We martial artists, when we punch!

Who wouldn’t want the martial artists of the world to see their fist techniques and feel as if the heavens were above, leaving them no choice but to sheath their fists in fear?

A talisman boat, late and conspicuous, glided through the crowd of sword cultivators hovering in the air, finally coming within a few dozen steps of the city wall. The two martial artists sparring atop the wall were clearly visible, their figures flickering like smoke.

When Pei Qian finally saw her master, her fears melted away. She perched on the railing of the boat alongside the great goose, placing her walking stick horizontally across her knees.

As she watched, a complex emotion welled up within her.

This was the first time she had seen her master like this.

Since their first meeting and subsequent reunions, her master had never appeared this spirited.

Not “appeared to be,” but never had.

Her master’s brow bore no worries.

Her master, at this moment, was simply a pure martial artist.

At this moment, her master was just Chen Ping’an himself.

Pei Qian felt both joy and sorrow.

Her small fists rested gently on her walking stick, her dark complexion illuminated by a pair of eyes that sparkled like the sun and moon.

Cui Dongshan smiled faintly, unknowingly shaking his sleeves, creating subtle ripples that concealed her from any unusual sights.

Not far from the talisman boat, an old sword cultivator rode a massive sword, behind which stood a cluster of young heads of varying heights.

One child shook his head, declaring, “That Chen Ping’an isn’t going to make it. He hasn’t fought back after so many punches; he’s definitely going to lose!”

More children chimed in, all expressing their sympathy and frustration for the second shopkeeper, who was so renowned yet was losing to an outsider from the Central Continent.

How could he, as someone half a member of the Sword Qi Great Wall, lose to an outsider martial artist? How could he hold his head high?

The old sword cultivator merely watched silently, smiling but saying nothing.

After all, he was not the only one losing money; every gambler on the city wall wore a grim expression, their gazes filled with ire, as it seemed everyone had lost.

One child turned around, eyeing a peculiar little black figure on that strange little boat. It looked young.

He asked, “Hey, who are you? I’ve never seen you before!”

Pei Qian turned her head, timidly replying, “I’m my master’s disciple.”

The child rolled his eyes, muttering, “So who is your master’s master?”

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment before breaking into a brilliant smile, “My master is the one who will win with just one punch atop the city wall!”

The child pouted, whispering, “So you’re the disciple of that Yu Juanzhou? I’d say it’s better to be the disciple of the second shopkeeper.”

Pei Qian was momentarily stunned. Were the children of the Sword Qi Great Wall really this foolish? It seemed they didn’t have even half of the white-haired scholar’s wit.

Thinking this, Pei Qian quickly looked around, but there were too many people and she couldn’t spot the white-haired figure.

This was good; it was best if the white-haired one had already left the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Pei Qian chose not to look any longer, focusing instead on her master’s fighting style.

Ah, her master was probably too outstanding, having made many enemies at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

What a pity that the sword cultivators lacked insight, and how magnificent her master was!

On the city wall, several Sword Immortals floating in the sea of clouds began to focus their attention on the battlefield.

Then the earth-bound sword cultivators, who sensed something amiss, started to take notice. 

As for the other young sword cultivators, they remained oblivious, unaware that the outcome was hanging by a thread.

Yu Juanzhou pushed off the ground, her figure moving like the wind. It was only after she vanished from sight that a tremendous crash resounded, sending ripples through the air. 

With a speed surpassing her earlier swiftness, she instantly arrived before the one who had taken three hundred thirty-one punches, with no visible harm done, and delivered a knee to his chest, swiftly following up with a punch to Chen Ping’an’s forehead, causing his head to jolt back. 

Having landed the strike, Yu Juanzhou retreated, using the rebound from the punch’s impact to spring back several dozen feet.

Since her punches could not be likened to a Sword Immortal’s flying sword, she instead opted to resort to a blunt strategy. This was, after all, the original intent behind her probing punches; she wasn’t in a hurry. All she needed was to accumulate advantages gradually and successfully deliver a series of such punches, which would build up her winning momentum, and with sufficient momentum, victory would soon follow!

As soon as Yu Juanzhou’s feet touched the ground, the moment she had landed a punch, a booming sensation echoed through the air.

After returning the punch, not only did Yu Juanzhou find herself retaliated against and her head snapped back, but she also had to lean back to stop herself from falling, sliding backward but managing to remain upright.

Moreover, she instinctively changed direction to evade Chen Ping’an’s next punch, which was bound to be tremendously forceful.

However, the next moment, although she evaded, Chen Ping’an’s figure was already waiting for her nearby. This was a feeling Yu Juanzhou was very familiar with but also strange, for in past confrontations, her opponents merely waited without throwing punches. But today, atop the city wall, the new opponent wasted no time and was utterly unmerciful. 

With a single punch, he sent Yu Juanzhou’s face crashing against the wall.

Cui Dongshan chuckled softly, “Senior sister, did you see that? The pinnacle of punching intent lies not in being reckless but in the ability to punch, pause, and punch again. When one’s punches align with their heart, it becomes effortless, that’s the true essence of martial arts. If not for the fact that my master’s previous punch didn’t alter its course and was delivered following the natural flow, that girl would have been half-dead by now.”

Pei Qian stared, admonishing, “Don’t make a sound.”

Cui Dongshan didn’t mind. Although she seemed indifferent, as if she hadn’t truly remembered anything, the truth was that everything she thought she hadn’t retained was firmly lodged in her heart. Whenever needed, she could recall anything in an instant.

Yu Juanzhou sat against the wall, looking up at Chen Ping’an, “There’s still a third round.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “There’s no third round, we both know it. If you refuse to admit defeat, fine, let’s talk after you break through.”

Yu Juanzhou swallowed a mouthful of blood but didn’t wipe the streaks from her face. Furrowing her brow, she said, “In martial arts exchanges, the more the merrier. Are you afraid that Ning Yao might misunderstand?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Yes, I am.”

Yu Juanzhou had no retort.

Only then did Chen Ping’an look toward the talisman boat, raise his arm, lightly clench his fist, and shake it, smiling, “You’ve come.”

Pei Qian jumped up, tucking her walking stick under her arm, standing on the railing of the boat, and lightly clapping her hands.

Cao Qinglang approached the front of the boat, also wearing a rarely seen bright smile.

Cui Dongshan remained seated, hands tucked in his sleeves, bowing respectfully, “Student pays respects to the master.”

If you also counted the figure sitting cross-legged atop the distant city wall, then today at the Sword Qi Great Wall, 

the lineage of the Culture Sage, considered to be withering and negligible, had, in fact, a great Sword Immortal at their side, a seventh stage martial artist in Chen Ping’an, a peak fourth stage martial artist in Pei Qian, a Jade Purity realm in Cui Dongshan, and a bottle-necked Cave Dwelling realm in Cao Qinglang.
