 ### Chapter 801: The Moon Above (Part Two)

Fortunately, when they arrived in the Realm of Haoran, such entities no longer existed. Aside from Chen Chuan'an, a troublesome figure from Nanposao Continent, the cultivators from Fuyou Continent and Tongye Continent were known to all the great demon lords. They were well aware of the conduct of those who had attained mastery in the so-called arts, as well as the majority of the celestial sects and their disciples. For centuries, the behaviors and exploits of ancestral masters and earthly immortals were clear as day—their temperaments, their disciples' aspirations, all laid bare.

The most elegant sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall had once been seen enjoying wine from a Wine Spring Cup, leaning against the corridor while watching beautiful maidens dance with their swords. He crafted various fragrant sachets, each one wildly popular in the residences of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Sun Juyuan, with hair disheveled and barefooted, stood at the center of a battlefield surrounded by the remnants of the demon army.

Holding a broken long sword, his blood-stained robe spoke of the chaos around him. The blurred vision of the sword immortal scanned his surroundings, was it a dream, or was he truly intoxicated by the chaos of life?

A sword immortal from the Central Plains, who bore a naturally gloomy expression, had found a way to balance his duality on the battlefield.

Nearby, a young demon cultivator held aloft the severed head of an aged sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall, tears streaming down his face as he shouted, “I have avenged my master!” 

He then discarded the head and charged into the fray. In the theater of war, where death was inevitable, all he could do was strive for more accomplishments for his sect and tribe.

In this savage land, the great demons and earthly immortals were vying for territory to reach the Realm of Haoran. Each upper-tier demon had their own paths to tread, while earthly immortals sought to ascend to higher realms or acquire more coveted resources. But the majority of the demon race, akin to ants, were merely driven here, as the entire savage realm had been divided by Mount Tuo Yue into twenty paths leading to the Sword Qi Great Wall battlefield, littered with the bones of those who perished before even reaching the battle.

The grand demon known as Rehguang carelessly tossed aside the head of a sword immortal, seemingly unconcerned, for there was always a military ledger to record such achievements.

This large, crimson-robed ascendant demon was not returning to the battlefield merely out of pity for the unfortunate Huang Luan, but because he was confident in the battlefield’s changing tides. After the last of the three teachings' saints fell, scattering his essence, the fortunes of the land had decisively tilted in favor of the savage realm, overpowering the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The sword cultivators stationed at the wall had no choice but to gradually retreat, as the military reports had predicted. As the war dragged on, more and more sword cultivators fell, faster and faster.

A Liang had long been trapped within a realm of heaven and earth, out of sight from the city wall.

Liu Cha had successfully repelled Qi Tingji.

In the heart of the battlefield, only Chen Xi and Nalan Shaowei remained as sword immortals.

After them stood Lu Zhi, Yue Qing, Mi Hu, Guo Jia, Yan Ming, and the sword immortal from the Hidden Official lineage, Shou Miao, who firmly held the line, buying time for the other sword cultivators to retreat back to the city wall.

Outside the sword immortals, a short old woman faced a towering demon warrior clad in golden armor, whose gleaming armor shimmered as he wielded his weapon, never having unsheathed it.

The demon had evidently been targeting the old woman for quite some time. From afar, he unleashed a spell to shorten the distance, slashing with his blade, leaving a deep wound across her back.

The short old woman sidestepped, gathering her strength for another punch.

In her prime, when she was at the pinnacle of her power, even a mere foundation-building warrior would have been no match for her.

A white rainbow sword light, searching for the old woman, surged forth, cleaving through the demon warrior’s form, while a young woman swiftly darted to the old woman’s side and said, “Let’s go back together.”

In the distance, several great demons began to reveal their forms.

“Miss, let’s just leave it at that. From now on, consider it my time to slack off,” the old woman said softly. “Please hurry back, my dear. If you refuse, how can I fight with peace of mind? In the Yao family and the Ning residence, I’ve never slacked off. Just this once, please let me act out of selfishness.”

The old woman stepped forward, blocking Ning Yao and facing the southern battlefield, her back to her hometown, and smiled, “Miss, take care of yourself and your husband. A good man like your husband is not to be missed, lest he become someone else’s. I wouldn’t even allow it, not just Old Master and Madam, but even I and that old dog Nalan would object.”

The old woman cried out, “Ning girl! Don’t wait for me, wait for Chen Ping'an! One hundred years, one thousand years, it’s all worth it!”

The ninth-tier martial artist, Bai Lianshuang, forged ahead with his fists, leaving the scene.

The old woman felt a mix of guilt, reluctance, and relief.

At the forefront of the battlefield, Chen Xi cleaved through a demon lord’s small realm, redirecting the tip of his sword straight toward the greater demon known as Rehguang.

In the previous siege warfare during the Thirteen Struggles, this ascendant demon had been the stronghold’s master.

Rehguang was momentarily dumbfounded, unsure of what madness Chen Xi was possessed by, risking his life and cultivation to extend that sword.

If Chen Xi was merely chasing after him, Rehguang had no fear, possessing countless methods to evade his assault. Even if it cost him a century’s worth of hard-earned cultivation and a few treasured defensive artifacts, it was a small price to pay.

The demon lord who had previously fought alongside Chen Xi hurled a thunder spear, aiming for the old sword immortal’s back.

Meanwhile, Nalan Shaowei spared no effort, shielding his old friend Chen Xi from the spear, even as he found himself ensnared within the encirclement of two demon lords, watching Chen Xi’s sword fly away.

The elderly sword immortal, having carved the character “Chen” into the walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall, had his life and sword intent all within that one strike.

Rehguang, no matter how ascendant he was, could not escape death.

Nalan Shaowei laughed loudly, “Why not send another demon beast my way?!”

The practitioners of Yin-Yang and the Mo family had already departed from the Realm of Haoran.

Chen Sanqiu and Die Zhang walked together.

It was their first time at the Upside-Down Mountain, and they would be taking a cross-continental ferry known as “Coral Pendant” from the Central Plains.

Crossing through the gate, Chen Sanqiu took one last look back. 

Before he had been unable to leave his hometown, he had yearned for the Upside-Down Mountain, just a door away. Now that he had crossed that threshold, what was it like? It felt strangely hollow.

Die Zhang said, “Once we reach the Central Plains, we can wait for the doors to open once every hundred years.”

They found the Stork and Sparrow Inn.

The inn, located in a narrow alley, had a young innkeeper basking in the sun at the entrance. Upon seeing the young man in white and the one-armed woman, he rose with a cheerful greeting, “Welcome, honored guests, please come in.”

Crossing the threshold, Chen Sanqiu said, “Chen Ping'an once mentioned that if you see the innkeeper still at the Upside-Down Mountain, I should ask if you are a cultivator.”

Chen Sanqiu smiled and added, “Chen Ping'an also said it was merely curiosity, no malice intended.”

The young innkeeper leaned over the counter with a grin, “As a small-time merchant, I can barely maintain my modest family business; how could I be considered a cultivator?”

Chen Sanqiu nodded, deciding not to press further.

The young innkeeper glanced at a table of lazy patrons in the hall, irritation rising within him. “I open the doors for business, yet they act more haughty than I do!”

Business at the Stork and Sparrow Inn was meager, leaving the staff with little to do. 

One elderly man was responsible for opening and closing the doors and guarding at night, a middle-aged cook who lacked culinary skills, a robust woman cleaning the courtyard, and a young girl who had never worn a smile when receiving guests.

All four bore the surname Nian—Nian Hong, Nian Doufang, Nian Chuntiao, and Nian Chuanghua.

They gathered around a table, the man and woman sitting on one bench, while the old man and girl sat across from each other. The girl leaned on the table, yawning.

A drunken old man rested his foot on the bench while drinking, each sip making him squint and shiver.

A jug of wine could last him half a day.

The man appeared to be lost in thought, but his hand crept beneath the table towards the woman’s leg, only to be slapped away. Moments later, he tried again, demonstrating remarkable persistence.

The woman, busy gossiping with the girl about the various rumors surrounding the Upside-Down Mountain, shared tales that were somewhat risqué, for there was little else to discuss. She spoke of a certain Cloud Sign Immortal, who had left the Upside-Down Mountain due to an infatuation with a younger generation disciple at the Water Crystal Palace. Unable to scold or agree, she had no choice but to leave in embarrassment. There were also tales of a female cultivator at the Deer Cliff who had been severely punished. It was a peculiar mystery why she had never experienced such treatment during her own visits there.

The woman even asked the girl if she had heard about the Lingzhi Pavilion, which had recently moved. Despite the numerous celestial visitors, it was quite chaotic, filled with shameless courtesans. How could they expect return customers when the celestial guests flaunted their bosoms at banquets and called out in bed?

The young innkeeper brought over two plates of snacks, circling the counter and taking a seat on the only vacant bench. 

He set the plates of pickled yellow beans and vinegar peanuts on the table and jokingly chided the gossiping woman, “Why don’t you just settle down? Wasn’t it you who pretended to be a fox spirit and knocked on doors, only to be rejected for being unattractive?”

The girl, resting her cheek on the table, quietly asked, “Is the innkeeper really Chen Sanqiu and Die Zhang?”

The young innkeeper nodded and popped a peanut into his mouth. “They’re both talented young individuals, albeit with a bit of bloodlust.”

The old man took another sip of wine, still not having emptied his cup, shrinking back as he drank. “Chen Sanqiu seems to have both sword and literary talent—truly a gem!”

“And as for that young girl, losing an arm is no concern; she has the look of someone who brings good fortune to her husband.”

“Hey, innkeeper! This wine paired with pickled yellow beans is truly exquisite,” the man mumbled. “You’ve managed to turn a drink that smells like horse urine into the finest celestial brew!”

The young innkeeper sighed, “At least it’s wine brewed from our own shop; can’t you say something nice to earn some good karma?”

The girl pulled a delicate rattle from her sleeve, its face painted and its dragon skin stitched, with a peach wood handle and a red thread attached with a glaze bead.

The old man frowned, “Chuanghua, put that away.”

The young innkeeper chuckled, “Doesn’t matter.”

Looking at the four before him, the young innkeeper said, “All these years, thank you for your hard work.”

The woman sighed in lament, taking out a bamboo hairpin resembling a green stalk and placing it on the table, fiddling with it gently.

The man seized the opportunity while the woman was distracted, slapping her on the backside, creating a crisp sound—both delightful and embarrassing at the same time. “Not a bit of hardship here. It’s quite comfortable; I don’t even want to go back.”

The woman retaliated with a strong slap to the man’s face, sending him spinning to the ground. The man sat back on the long bench, covering his face, only to be kicked away by the woman.

The girl known as Nian Chuanghua whispered, “Innkeeper, why did Lady Gui back out? If she went with us, wouldn’t she be truly at peace? At that time, we could introduce her to Bai Yujing…”

The young innkeeper waved his hand, signaling the girl to stop.

Looking out the door, he sighed, “A solitary lamp in the inn, sleepless, what does a traveler’s heart turn to but sadness? Holding a candle to check the graying strands, another year with more white snow.”

The man slammed the table, cheering loudly, while the old man quickly sipped his wine, “Incredible, incredible! I’m drunk, drunk!”

The girl with her head on the table grew furious, gripping the edge of the table, revealing only her head as she kicked the man vigorously.

The young innkeeper, with a radiant smile, cupped his fists in gratitude.

The woman looked at the innkeeper opposite her and shared a knowing smile.

This young innkeeper was far more endearing and approachable than the deputy master of her hometown.

The young innkeeper plucked a vinegar peanut from the bowl and tossed it lightly back, slowly saying, “The little grass by the lamp writes the peach talisman.”

The other four at the table ceased their playful antics, sitting up straight.

The young innkeeper continued, “If all else fails, I may have to take a trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Even if there are suspicions of taking advantage of the situation. As for you four, you don’t need to follow me; returning to my hometown is not difficult.”

All four had no objections.

In the realm of Qing Ming, the esteemed Suichu Palace was as renowned as the Xuandu Temple.

The palace master was the most influential, but he had been in seclusion for many years.

Thus, the most capable person was the young innkeeper, the keeper of the New Year.

Nian Hong, with the Dao name "Dragon in the Cave," originally named Zhang Yuanbo.

Nian Doufang, with the Dao name "Lord on the Mountain," Yu Chou.

The woman known as Nian Chuntiao was actually the Dao companion of Yu Chou. Nian Chuanghua, the girl, known as "Candlelight," was the direct daughter of the palace master; the yearly custom of lighting candles at the Suichu Palace on New Year’s Eve and the traditional drumming to drive away ghosts was performed by her, relying not on her status but her genuine cultivation.

If one were to consider only seniority and cultivation levels, not numbers, it could be said that half of the Suichu Palace was gathered in this small Stork and Sparrow Inn.

However, aside from the young innkeeper, the other four had come here as incomplete souls, with their true bodies and yang spirits still in the Suichu Palace. Their journey as yin spirits was indeed quite far.

The ferry docked at the Upside-Down Mountain, and after leaving the Stork and Sparrow Inn, Chen Sanqiu and Die Zhang boarded the ship.

The name “Coral Pendant” made Chen Sanqiu grip the railing tightly.

He had read too many miscellaneous books, his realm too low, and his swordsmanship lacking.

Once the courier arrived, the precious pendant was delivered, shaking his insides upon opening the box, revealing a dazzling sight.

Chen Sanqiu smiled bitterly, instinctively reaching for his waist to grab his wine flask, only to remember he had quit drinking and left home without any.

Die Zhang didn’t know how to comfort Chen Sanqiu.

In the past, the solitary one-armed girl had envied the bustling Chen family estate on Tai Xiang Street, but now, she didn’t know whom to envy.

Beside her, Chen Sanqiu recalled his sister Ning, the plump Yan, the black charcoal Dong, and that little girl, Guo Zhujiu—each one hanging a placard of absence on the wall of his wine shop…

Even the girl who had lost an arm without shedding a tear now raised her remaining arm to shield her eyes.

Cheng Quan, the nascent soul sword cultivator, led a group of young practitioners, carrying a cotton-wrapped sword box, to the Upside-Down Mountain.

Among them were Yan Zhuo and Dong Hua Fu, both at the bottleneck of the Golden Core stage.

They encountered an old real immortal wielding a dragon whisk, and Cheng Quan handed him a personal letter from a Daoist sage and another heavily restricted family letter, hoping the Great Heavenly Lord would take it back to the realm of Qing Ming.

The old real immortal noticed a young sword cultivator. The youth took out a wooden handle with a whisk, prompting the old immortal to sigh, “Keep it for yourself; it’s your destined fate.”

Under the old immortal's guidance, they ascended to the isolated mountain at the center of the Upside-Down Mountain, where he personally arranged them in a mansion halfway up the mountain. Cheng Quan found Yan Zhuo and handed him an object concealed by the Daoist sage’s illusion, saying it had been given to him by the young hidden official for the sage to pass on to him. In the future, when he reached Qing Ming, he could take it along to explore the great Xuandu Temple.

Cheng Quan remarked, “Chen Ping'an’s complicated methods surely have their reasons.”

Yan Zhuo nodded, stowing the object away.

Yan Zhuo appeared dull, while Dong Hua Fu sat silently beside him.

Cheng Quan looked at the two young men, feeling compelled to say, “Though the days may be tough, they must still be lived.”

Outside the small courtyard, the ancient pines in the mountain stood like snow.

Wei Jin and Mi Yu, both at the bottleneck of the Jade Purity realm, accompanied a rather self-conscious Golden Core practitioner, Wei Wenlong.

They boarded the cross-continental ferry “Osmanthus Island” from the Old Dragon City, leaving the Upside-Down Mountain.

The entire Chun Fan Pavilion vanished overnight.

Now, among the four major private residences of the Upside-Down Mountain, the Yuan Ruo mansion had been dismantled into a hollow structure, and both the Plum Blossom Garden and Chun Fan Pavilion were no more, leaving only the solitary Water Crystal Palace. The ancestral master of this celestial estate, Master Yunqian, had also taken a large group of young disciples to seek out immortals.

Wei Wenlong’s fellow disciples would follow the sword immortal Shao Yunyan to Nanposao Continent.

Previously accompanying Mi Yu, Wei Wenlong was visiting the Sword Qi Great Wall for the first time, and this time he was still with Mi Yu, leaving the Upside-Down Mountain.

Yan Ming had gone to the battlefield, while Nalan Caihuan took the southern Qianli ferry to Fuyou Continent, potentially not settling there but heading further north to the Golden Armor Continent, or even to the Flowing Clouds Continent.

The “Haoliang” sword nurturing gourd had been secretly handed over by the young hidden official to Shao Yunyan, then passed on to Mi Yu.

Mi Yu intended to gift this sword nurturing gourd, originally belonging to Chen Ping'an, to the girl named Pei Qian.

The three of them resided in the small courtyard belonging to the young hidden official.

As the ferry passed Rain Dragon Sect, Mi Yu glanced over from a distance and smirked.

On Osmanthus Island, whether among the few returning passengers or the many ferry crew members, aside from the gracefully poised Lady Gui, everyone else was on edge.

Wei Jin discussed with the two about returning to his hometown, Baoping Continent, from Old Dragon City. First, he would visit the Frost and Snow Temple's Immortal Platform to offer wine at his master’s grave, then head straight to the Fallen Mountain. After that, Wei Wenlong would stay at Fallen Mountain, while Mi Yu would go to the Taihui Sword Sect in the North Ju Lu Continent. Wei Wenlong had no objections, while Mi Yu remarked that if the Taihui Sword Sect was willing to accept him as a nominal disciple, it would be great, as it would be a favor to him. If not, that was fine too; he had already decided to enjoy himself at Fallen Mountain.

At the peak of Osmanthus Island, the scenery was pleasant, and the evening glow was resplendent.

The Jade Purity realm sword immortal, with the flying sword "Xiamantian," sat alone on the railing, the gourd “Haoliang” hanging at his waist, holding a jug of Osmanthus wine, its fragrance wafting in the air.

For some reason, Guo Zhujiu hadn’t accompanied him to Baoping Continent.

As a sword cultivator from the Hidden Official lineage, Guo Zhujiu was an official disciple of the Hidden Official master, and Mi Yu had greatly wished for a fellow townsman to accompany him, someone with whom he could chat in his dialect.

He had heard from the young hidden official that the ferry manager of Osmanthus Island, a Golden Core old sword cultivator named Ma Zhi, was a worthy elder to befriend.

As for Lady Gui’s only disciple, the Osmanthus girl, Jin Su, he had heard of her.

But for now, Mi Yu only wanted to drink, too lazy to think about anything else.

Due to the increasing commercialization of the cross-continental ferry business, the number of travelers visiting the Upside-Down Mountain had been steadily declining, resulting in a downturn in business for the painters on Osmanthus Island. Over time, the painting stalls under the osmanthus tree had dwindled to just one. Many painters from the Fan family had left Osmanthus Island to seek new paths in Old Dragon City.

The remaining one was a middle-aged painter, whose cultivation aptitude was lacking, merely a fifth-tier Qi refining cultivator. In a small feudal state of Baoping Continent, becoming a court painter wouldn’t be difficult. But living under someone else’s roof, the earnings were meager—a painting might fetch a few hundred or even a few thousand taels of silver, which was considered a high price in the worldly realm, but compared to celestial currency, it was hardly worth mentioning.

Seeing the man lost in thought by the railing, the painter picked up a jug of street-quality wine from Old Dragon City, unable to afford the Osmanthus wine, and approached the unidentified young man.

“Let’s make friends over a drink; perhaps I can secure some extra business; it’s been tough not opening for a while.”

Mi Yu turned to the middle-aged painter standing beside him, who was at a loss for words, and asked, “I heard the price for a painting here is thirty snowflake coins, and if I want three, could you give me a discount to twenty-five?”

The painter nodded, “Back when business was good, we would take five coins for ourselves from twenty-five. Nowadays, business is tough, so Fan family is generous and gives it all to the painter.”

This guest’s Baoping dialect was not very fluent.

However, it was heard that this exceptionally handsome young man was a friend of the sword immortal Wei Jin from the Frost and Snow Temple.

Could he be at least a starting earthly immortal?

Mi Yu smiled, “You wouldn’t happen to be called Su Yuting, would you?”

The painter was taken aback. “How does the guest know my name?”

Su Yuting was self-aware, knowing that his painting skills, while not poor, would hardly impress the celestial masters on the mountain.

Mi Yu replied with a smile, “Is the offer of a ten percent discount still valid? If so, I’d like to commission three paintings from you.”

“Painter Su.”

Adding “master” to the surname was a significant compliment, both on the mountain and in the valleys.

Su Yuting was first astonished, then enlightened, raising a finger and shaking it lightly, as if he truly remembered someone but couldn’t recall clearly.

Mi Yu prompted, “The one who carried a sword box and wore straw sandals.”

Su Yuting clapped his hands in recognition, laughing, “I remember now! That young master was a bit shy at first, but after drinking, he became quite spirited.”

Su Yuting then felt a bit embarrassed, “I didn’t expect that young master would still remember me.”

Mi Yu nodded, “He mentioned you, praising your paintings for their vibrant spirit, dynamic colors, and meticulous details, saying that whenever he had the chance to visit Osmanthus Island, he must find you to paint, assuring me it would be worth it.”

Su Yuting blushed deeply, softly saying, “I’m too unworthy, too unworthy.”

Mi Yu jumped down from the railing and went to the ancestral osmanthus tree.

As dusk faded and night approached, he looked up.

Waiting for the moon to rise.

One could wait for the phases of the moon, but what about people?

Lu Zhi, accompanied by a woman with a veil obscuring her face, walked out from the Sword Qi Great Wall, followed by several core disciples of Chun Fan Pavilion.

Together, they departed from the Upside-Down Mountain.

At the old gate, a young Daoist boy glanced at the solitary mountain, putting away his book and mat, saying, “Let’s go.”

The man holding the sword squatted in place, nodding and smiling, “Go ahead.”

The young Daoist boy asked, “Aren’t you coming with me to the Realm of Qing Ming?”

Zhang Lu shook his head, “I want to keep my eyes wide open and watch the Realm of Haoran, to see whether I can still consider the Sword Qi Great Wall a joke.”

The young Daoist boy vanished in a flash, arriving at the base of the Water Crystal Palace. Using his powers, he bent down and straightened up, flipping the entire Water Crystal Palace from the Upside-Down Mountain into the sea.

On this day, the Great Heavenly Lord stood atop the mountain, casting the decree of his master, transforming it into a rainbow light that shot straight up to the sky. Then he activated the formation, this largest mountain seal in the realm broke through the heavens, as several Daoist immortals from Bai Yujing appeared at the junction of the two realms, guiding the Upside-Down Mountain toward the Realm of Qing Ming.

Where the Upside-Down Mountain once stood, only the remnants of the old gate separating the savage realm and the Realm of Haoran remained, along with the great sword immortal Zhang Lu, who had betrayed the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Qingdu revealed his true form, a sword that opened the heavens.

Ascending the entire city.

The demon army surged forcefully onto the now unguarded walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

All the sword cultivators of the savage realm, whether they were sword immortals or sword practitioners, drew their swords to intercept the city.

Most of the great demon lords from the savage realm, along with a multitude of upper-tier beings, chose to attack the old great sword immortal’s true form.

The ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain, a gray-robed elder, sneered, “How pitiful; this is your last sword. In this great war, when it comes to slaying my demons, you, Chen Qingdu, are not even as good as a lower-tier sword cultivator.”

The gray-robed elder stepped forward, his true form towering, taller than the Sword Qi Great Wall. He clenched his fists, harnessing the might of the entire savage realm’s great path, and struck heavily at the center of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

This directly created a massive gap in the walls, rendering Chen Qingdu unable to intercept with his sword, and leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall defenseless.

The gray-robed elder's true form stood between the gaps, his fists hammering down on either side of the walls. Each punch, even when struck by the true form of the great demon with its innate powers, further blurred the already indistinct figure of Chen Qingdu.

The old great sword immortal’s true form remained rooted at the city, after breaking through the heavens with a single sword, it held firm to the sky, pulling apart the swirling vortex, refusing to converge.

For the first time since its inception, the Sword Qi Great Wall suffered such significant damage, with the walls breaking into two segments.

From the prison emerged a figure, stooped and swaying… a person?

Faintly, one could see the outline of a human shape, yet only a pair of golden eyes glimmered with brilliance, surrounded by a dense and indistinct shadow, as if the entirety of their being was composed of countless fine black threads.

That figure shot up into the air, landing heavily atop the city walls, stirring numerous demons.

Some demons with sufficient cultivation levels instinctively chose to avoid that bizarre presence.

The shadow that landed on the city walls looked up, raising its arm high in farewell.

As if to a beloved, that moon hung in the sky, marking an eternal separation.

This dark figure turned away, facing the ascendant city that was slowly rising, turning its back on the old great sword immortal Chen Qingdu.

The true form of Chen Qingdu declared loudly, “Kid, remember the agreement. I can break it, but you cannot!”

To firmly guard half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, if the savage realm rampaged in the Realm of Haoran for ten or a hundred years, then for ten or a hundred years, you, Chen Ping'an, will sit here for a thousand years!

The remnants of Chen Qingdu's soul approached that figure, saying, “Thank you for your hard work.”

The dark figure gently shook its head, then nodded.

The old great sword immortal smiled and patted the young man on the shoulder.

The dark figure took a step back, bowing in farewell to the old great sword immortal.

In the midst of their words, the old great sword immortal's essence dissipated, merging into the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall beneath them, and thus, in this world, Chen Qingdu ceased to exist.

That ethereal dark figure remained silent, taking a step to the southern city wall, its fingers aligned, swiftly sweeping through the air.

On the city wall appeared sword immortal true spirits emerging from the scroll of the Respect Sword Pavilion.

The scroll sword immortals had no awareness; they only knew that all who ascended the wall besides the dark figure would be slain.

As long as half of the Sword Qi Great Wall remained, these sword immortals would not fall.

Having completed this task, the dark figure瞬间 arrived at the gap in the city wall, where demons attempted to intercept. Regardless of whether it was the true body of a cultivator or an attacking treasure, all were instantly reduced to dust.

The dark figure stood firm like a cliff, confronting the gray-robed elder on the other side of the wall from afar.

Those golden eyes of the shadow fixated on the opponent.

The gray-robed elder shook his head, “Why do this?”

Between the two segments of the wall, the gap was like a wide road, countless demon armies swarming through.

The dark figure vanished into thin air.

Reappearing in the distance, it seized a wind-riding demon of the Jade Purity realm from the clouds, grasping its head, the forehead instantly a bloody mess, hoisting the demon into the air.

“Remember, in this world, Chen Ping'an guards the city wall.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 802: Freedom and Long Journeys (Part One)

Liu Cha, with his sword and dagger at his side, resembled a great-bearded wanderer as he approached the gray-clad elder and asked, "Aren't you going to do anything about the words on the city wall?"

Half of the Sword Qi Great Wall had already fallen into the Wilderness, and soon it would be completely refined by this ancestor of Mount Tuo Yue, adding a bit more to the Great Dao.

The gray-clad elder smiled and replied, "Let's leave them be. The celestial beings atop the mountains in the vast world do not know how to respect the strong; we have come."

Sword Immortal Shou Chen arrived on his sword, respectfully stating, "The Hundred Sword Immortals of Mount Tuo Yue are all arranged. Some sword cultivators not listed in the roster, unhappy about their minor accomplishments, I had to slay three of them to quiet things down."

Several aspiring Sword Immortals, including Li Zhen, gathered to join in the excitement.

Li Zhen smiled and said, "We cannot indulge in bad habits. Well done, Sword Immortal Shou Chen."

Along with Li Zhen, Zhu Ke, Yu Si, Tan, and a female sword cultivator named Liu Bai, who had taken on a new appearance, all gathered here.

On the city walls belonging to the Wilderness, these talented sword cultivators with the best aptitude found spots to nurture their flying swords, hoping to absorb a fragment of the ancient Sword Immortal's essence and increase their sword luck. The spirit of those elusive Sword Immortals was the purest; later generations of sword practitioners who resonated with their sword path would gain opportunities. For millennia, foreign sword cultivators who traveled here had received such benefits, just as the sword cultivators from the Wilderness had seen fortunate ones on the battlefield.

To assist the Hundred Sword Immortals of Mount Tuo Yue, the great demons had already begun to clear the battlefield, ensuring that too much sword luck wouldn’t interfere with the great paths of these heavenly talents.

Moreover, the brutal battlefield ruins beneath the city walls still held significant utility, as they could be relocated to the old site of Hanging Mountain to alter the celestial timing of the vast world.

Li Zhen proposed, "If someone were to slay an Ascendant in the vast world, how about we carve a word on the north side of the city wall?"

The gray-clad elder nodded, "That works."

Liu Cha chuckled, "It would be quite a sight."

Li Zhen lightly stomped his foot. "Can’t the ancestor refine it but not take it into his possession?"

It was said that the Dao Ancestor once rode a cow through here to explore the Wilderness.

The gray-clad elder shook his head with a smile. "If Chen Qingdu can’t do it, neither can I. The Sword Qi Great Wall can be severed or shattered, but it cannot be pocketed, just as a Sword Immortal can die, but can never be humiliated. Of course, there are many old stories behind this. In short, if it weren’t for Chen Qingdu needing to open the sky with his sword, taking the whole city to ascend and send off the sword cultivators, even if I exerted myself to the utmost against him and the Sword Qi Great Wall, I would have to destroy a great deal of mountains and fortune in the Wilderness. That would be a heavy loss, something I do not wish for."

Li Zhen cradled his head in his hands and gazed across the city wall, but that fellow had already left. Otherwise, he would have greeted the Hidden Official properly and strengthened their friendship. "No matter, let’s practice our swords here, break through one by one, and then go to the vast world to seek swords."

Shou Chen spoke, "That Hanging Mountain has also ascended, but thanks to the decree of the second official, and with the three city lords of Bai Yu Jing personally leading the way, and the Confucian temple not obstructing, it was quite smooth."

Liu Cha said solemnly, "Chen Qingdu's sword has never fallen on the battlefield. Otherwise, even if the ancestor intervened, our losses would still be tremendous."

Li Zhen sighed, "Senior, you call that boosting others' morale while diminishing your own prestige."

Liu Cha couldn’t be bothered to respond to such drivel.

Liu Bai approached her senior Shou Chen and quietly asked, "What’s going on with that person?"

Shou Chen shook his head, "You’d have to ask the ancestor."

The gray-clad elder looked at Liu Bai and smiled, "This Hidden Official has merged with the Sword Qi Great Wall. He has also utilized the sewing technique, carrying many true names from the 'Mountain Search Map,' which allows him to mutually overpower the Wilderness. His current situation is rather pitiful. From now on, there will be no more Yin God excursions or Yang God external bodies; the three have been thoroughly fused into one. In simple terms, he has spent half his life. As a disciple of the Confucian lineage, his original character has become a luxury. As for why he appears this way now, it’s because Chen Qingdu forced him to merge; his body can’t take it, but it’s not a big problem. Once he reaches the pinnacle of the mountain realm, he has hopes of restoring his true form. Besides, Chen Ping’an himself should have received some sort of acknowledgment from the Sword Qi Great Wall, not merely carrying a true name. Typically, a Sword Immortal with only realm cannot merge."

Shou Chen felt a bit more reassured.

The ancestor was clearly in a good mood; otherwise, he wouldn't be so chatty today.

Tan was momentarily speechless. 

That pitiful fellow didn’t seem like they needed to take revenge anymore?

The young boy cautiously glanced at his sister Liu Bai.

Liu Bai had a complicated expression and softly asked, "Can we kill him?"

Liu Cha shook his head, "Killing him won't be enough; it's endless. Because the opponent is no longer just Chen Ping’an, but half of the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Shou Chen caught sight of the shadow pulling down a demon of the Jade Purity realm and asked curiously, "Immortal realm?"

Liu Cha shook his head, "After merging, it's a fake Jade Purity. One person monopolizing half of the Sword Qi Great Wall has all the advantages of time, place, and harmony."

A figure in a gray robe arrived at the cliff of the city wall, it was the Dragon Lord.

He had previously sought swords from Chen Qingdu and Guan Zhao at Mount Tuo Yue.

The Dragon Lord spoke hoarsely, "As long as we fully extract the sword luck here, that half of the Sword Qi Great Wall will be like water without a source, wood without roots, and can be shattered."

The gray-clad elder nodded, "Like a bone stuck in the throat, it’s very bothersome."

A little girl with braided hair jumped from the ground to the city wall, arriving beside the Dragon Lord.

In her hands, she dragged a long rope, tying up two large demon heads with dense malice, so as she climbed up, their heads repeatedly knocked against the wall with a sound like drums.

Two sword immortals from the old Hidden Official lineage, Luo Shan and Zhu An, followed her down gracefully.

Li Zhen grinned, "Are we watching a monkey show? Chen Ping’an isn’t even here."

Just as the boy's words fell, the shadow flashed closer.

Xiao Xian sent out a punch, shattering the shadow in an instant.

The next moment, the shadow reformed at the spot, though its face remained completely obscured, it vaguely exuded a mocking intent.

With every punch, Xiao Xian’s might far surpassed that of an ordinary Sword Immortal's full-power strike.

The aspiring Sword Immortals had to step back, distancing themselves from the formidable and notorious madman, especially the still weak Liu Bai, who needed to be shielded by her senior Shou Chen.

The gray-clad elder smiled and said, "Stop hitting; if you continue, you’ll only help him temper his body and elevate him to the mountain pinnacle. That would surely cause some minor trouble. This fellow is simply trying to bait you into striking."

Xiao Xian, however, continued to punch, treating the words of the lord of the Wilderness as mere background noise.

Eventually, bored, Xiao Xian finally retracted his fists and asked, "Why didn’t you stop me?"

The gray-clad elder replied, "I’m not Chen Qingdu; I don’t have so many rules to bind the strong. Mount Tuo Yue treasures someone like you, a peak powerhouse."

Xiao Xian shook the rope in his hand, the two demon heads soaring high before smashing heavily onto the city wall. "I built a throne in that rat hole using the bodies of two Ascendant demons, and the position is rather high."

The gray-clad elder chuckled, "Very good. As long as Zhuo Mi and Liu Cha don’t mind, it’s all fine."

Liu Cha said, "I don't mind."

The gray-clad elder continued, "Let’s not bother with that A Liang for now; it’s not easy to suppress one person with the entire Mount Tuo Yue."

Liu Cha nodded, "When I have the time, I’ll invite him for a drink."

The gray-clad elder smiled, "You sword practitioners are envied by others."

Xiao Xian said, "Boring; I’ll go play by myself."

She leaped off the city wall, leaving the two demon heads behind, finding it tedious, knowing no one would dare touch them.

As she moved forward, the city now rose from the ground, with numerous Sword Immortal residences reduced to ruins.

Everything was gone.

Wherever Xiao Xian passed, the tide of demon armies retreated on its own.

Otherwise, they would die.

The old gate at the site of Hanging Mountain was being torn apart by the two throne demons, the Radiant Armored Demon and the Golden Armored General, growing increasingly massive.

Meanwhile, the first to enter the vast world were Yang Zhi and Fei Fei, who, due to their affinity for water, began paving the way as a rallying point for the demon army from the Wilderness. They needed to create three paths leading to the closest Boso Continent, as well as the southwestern Fuyao Continent and the southeastern Tongye Continent.

Additionally, numerous mountain-moving demons assisted the two throne demons, smashing small refined mountains into the sea while the demon cultivators laid down mountain roots, transforming them into towering mountains, creating stable footholds.

Other throne demons also headed to the celestial realm to seek trouble with the Confucian sage.

The sword-wielding man remained sitting by the horse tethering post, but the post had been moved to the spot where the former young monk’s mat used to be.

A demon cultivator spat on the ground and laughed, "What a joke, a big Sword Immortal. I've seen those who died in battle, but never one who guards the gate without drawing their sword."

The great Sword Immortal Zhang Lu ignored this.

As a result, the demon was simply crushed by Xiao Xian, who swaggered through the gate with a casual punch, shattering its head, the Golden Core and Nascent Soul exploding, causing collateral damage to a large area of demons—a disastrous misfortune.

In the distance, a military officer overseeing the battlefield pretended nothing had happened after catching sight of the culprit.

Xiao Xian approached the horse tethering post and tossed over a jar of fine wine from a mundane dynasty in the Wilderness. Zhang Lu caught the jar, peeled back the clay seal, and sniffed, "Good wine."

Xiao Xian asked, "Zhang Lu, aren’t you coming with me to take a look? South Boso Continent, Tongye Continent, Fuyao Continent, you can choose; let’s go drink together. The immortal wines there are plentiful."

Zhang Lu smiled and said, "I’m not going anywhere. I’ll just watch from here. I’m inherently lazy, can’t muster the spirit for anything. I worked hard to break through just to increase my lifespan. Hidden Official, remember to send me some wine whenever you break a sect."

Xiao Xian complained, "You do nothing and still expect me to bring you wine—what an attitude."

Zhang Lu smiled, "Lazy people have their blessings."

Xiao Xian frowned and asked, "Where did my disciple go?"

Zhang Lu joked, "I really don’t know. You should ask the Hidden Official."

Xiao Xian sighed, "Seeing him is irritating; I’ll probably reward him with a few punches first. That kid holds grudges; I doubt I can get anything out of him."

Zhang Lu rubbed his chin.

That boy, who once carried a sword box and wore grass shoes, left Hanging Mountain and returned, later becoming a Hidden Official. Since then, Chen Ping’an never returned through the old gate, connecting the Sword Qi Great Wall and Hanging Mountain's Spring Banner Abode. Neither side was foolish; Chen Ping’an hoped Zhang Lu would change his mind, deliberately using this method to remind Zhang Lu, while Zhang Lu pretended not to notice, which was also a reminder.

Whether or not Zhang Lu was present, the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Wilderness would remain the same. Ultimately, the Sword Immortal Shao Yunyan from the Spring Banner Abode came here, drank with him, confirmed Zhang Lu's thoughts, and then left with Lu Zhi, without asking about Zhang Lu’s sword.

In that earlier contest of thirteen, Zhang Lu lost—not due to lacking skill—he had no resentment. In the earlier battles of the Sword Qi Great Wall, where life and death intertwined, Zhang Lu was indifferent. Ultimately, he bore the responsibility of guarding the gate, harboring some resentment towards the vast world. From the moment he volunteered to stand watch, he foresaw today’s events.

Xiao Xian asked, "The closest to here is that sect named Yu Long Sect, right?"

Zhang Lu laughed, "Too late; a throne demon has already gotten ahead."

Xiao Xian frowned, "That one who enjoys skinning people alive?"

Zhang Lu nodded, "The Yu Long Sect has many female cultivators."

Xiao Xian said, "Never mind, when Chen Ping’an leaves South Boso Continent to seek death, I’ll send him on his way."

Zhang Lu took a hearty drink from his wine, lamenting, "The one who truly kills Chen Ping’an will be the one everyone points at."

A handsome man with a sword-holding gourd landed atop a statue of the Yu Long Sect, twisting a strand of hair with his fingers, smiling, "It’s about time to pick a flower."

Millennia later, the gray-clad elder returned to the vast world once more.

He hovered high in the sky, laughing loudly, "Vast world, all Ascendants, Immortals, and all who have attained the Dao, listen well! You move too slowly; there’s no great freedom! Now that you’re at the mountain peak, it’s time for the heavens to be unrestrained; otherwise, isn’t it a tremendous joke to cultivate to the summit?! What Dao to pursue, what truth to seek, what immortality to obtain?! Like that young man, still bound by rules, day after day, year after year, moving like an old man. From now on, the world will have only one, where human and demon practitioners can speak freely, practice freely, kill freely, and live and die freely!"

Zhang Lu sighed, "A chaotic world has truly arrived."

Xiao Xian scoffed, "A world of freedom for the strong has come."

About two years ago.

The vast world was still the peaceful realm it had been for millennia.

A group of three left the old Great Li Dynasty territory of Baoping Continent, already traveling thousands of miles across the sea on the winds, still far from the Central Divine Continent.

It was Gu Can, Liu Zhi Cheng, and that dragon-brother addicted to falling realms, Chai Bo Fu.

The poor Nascent Soul was now just a sea-gazing practitioner.

When they first arrived at the old site of Huai Huang County in the Li Zhu Cave Heaven, Chai Bo Fu was just a Qi Refining practitioner who had been slapped to the Dragon Gate realm by Liu Zhi Cheng. Later, for some unknown reason, he inexplicably fell straight down to the Cave Dwelling realm. This long journey, riding the winds, he gritted his teeth and worked hard, finally crawling back to the Sea-Gazing realm.

After breaking through, Chai Bo Fu felt no joy; rather, he was about to fall back again without anyone giving him a palatable reason.

Traveling across continents was risky without taking the Immortal’s ferry; relying solely on practitioners riding the winds consumed spiritual energy and was far too dangerous. There were numerous fierce creatures in the sea, and a single misstep could lead to death, leaving no chance to recover the corpse. Take the Treasure Swallowing Whale, which could swallow islands and ferries alike, and they inherently had refining abilities. Eating a few practitioners meant nothing to them. Once inside their belly, it was like being in a small world’s cage, escaping was impossible.

Furthermore, in the vast ocean, killing and plundering was much more secure than on land; this type of business was typical of "three years without a single opening, but when it does, it feeds for three years."

Thus, even Golden Core and Nascent Soul practitioners, considered land immortals by mundane scholars, were unwilling to engage in such thankless labor. Of course, if they came to earn money, that was a different story.

In the vast world, the ocean was broader than the land of the Nine Continents. Besides the island immortals, numerous wealth routes also compelled practitioners to take risks. For example, the pearl divers of Luhua Island gathered extremely valuable pearls. Moreover, the emperors and nobles on land had a tremendous demand for dragon spittle, which always had a market value but no supply. The dragon-like creatures and many descendants of dragons all counted as dragon spittle, which could be refined into incense, with grades and prices varying widely.

In addition to dragon spittle, dragon fish contained many treasure pearls, which shone brightly due to absorbing the moonlight, able to illuminate rooms and dispel evil spirits in heavy malice places. They could also be refined into water-repelling pearls and dust-repelling pearls—excellent aids for practitioners during closed-door cultivation, cleansing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and helping to focus the mind.

True opportunities lay within the overseas immortal mountains, with many secretive remnants. Once a Qi Refining practitioner got their hands on one, it was like obtaining mountains of gold and silver. Moreover, compared to the immortal houses on land, there was less contention, and there wouldn’t be too many forces tangled up in it. If the immortal abode was hard to open and heavily restricted, usually only two or three families familiar with each other would ally quietly to take it in and divide the heavenly materials and earthly treasures.

Amidst their silence, Gu Can suddenly asked, "Master hasn’t shown up for a long time."

Compared to Gu Can’s weary journey, Liu Zhi Cheng, dressed in a bright pink robe, glided through the winds with an air of elegance.

But the one truly suffering was still that dragon-brother, with Liu Zhi Cheng and Gu Can indifferent to him, leaving him without pity.

Chai Bo Fu was delighted that the two were ignoring him. One was carefree, the other ruthless; he was more than happy to be invisible.

Liu Zhi Cheng laughed, "My senior brother is a heavenly being; it’s normal not to see him. In Bai Di City, your seniors and sisters have gone a hundred years without seeing their master, so it’s nothing strange. If they see him several times within a hundred years, it’ll only make them anxious, fearing they’re no longer themselves."

Chai Bo Fu couldn’t help but feel that on the path of cultivation, this bit of hardship was nothing. As long as he could become a registered disciple in Bai Di City, even if it meant being Gu Can's personal disciple, he would accept it!

The issue of Gu Can's status in Bai Di City had always been a mystery.

Gu Can had always been respectful towards that person.

Yet that person, along with Liu Zhi Cheng, seemed to regard Gu Can as a younger brother, with no clear statement. Liu Zhi Cheng often called him junior brother or nephew indiscriminately.

Gu Can maintained a calm expression and casually asked, "Is Master visiting friends at sea?"

Liu Zhi Cheng sneered, "What a joke! Who’s worth my senior brother’s visit? Going out to sea to visit immortals? Visiting what immortals? My senior brother is the most immortal person under heaven. Seeking the celestial beings on the mountains of Bai Di City, they come in droves each year, but they can only obediently stand by the water’s edge, looking up at the sky. How many get to linger in the clouds? Not to mention my senior brother’s solitary existence in Bai Di City."

Gu Can wondered, "Aren't the uncles and those senior brothers and sisters in Bai Di City cultivating?"

Liu Zhi Cheng suddenly remembered he hadn’t shared the current situation of Bai Di City with Gu Can, so he slapped the forehead of his dragon-brother, sending him directly into the water.

Liu Zhi Cheng laughed and explained, "In that massive Bai Di City, aside from my senior brother, there are only puppets serving as female officials, neither god nor human, neither ghost nor demon. As for the rest of us junior brothers and sisters and our respective direct disciples, we each have our own cultivation abodes in the clouds. For example, I have a renowned Liuli Pavilion. Thus, the true Bai Di City has always only had one practitioner, which is your master, my senior brother. Anyone else is just a burden to him."

Gu Can nodded, "Impressive."

Liu Zhi Cheng laughed heartily, "Not impressive! My senior brother is universally recognized as a devil practitioner; how can Bai Di City stand tall in the Central Divine Continent?"

A drenched chicken flew back into the sky, not daring to show anger or speak.

Liu Zhi Cheng lightly patted the forehead of the young Chai Bo Fu, praising, "With such a big forehead, you could use it for drying grain."

Suddenly, Liu Zhi Cheng exclaimed, noticing Chai Bo Fu bleeding from his ears and nose, "What’s wrong?"

Chai Bo Fu wiped the blood and forced a smile at the clueless culprit, "It’s nothing serious."

The three landed on an island scattered across the ocean, where the spiritual energy was thin, and the landscape dry and uninviting for building residences and cultivating.

Gu Can floated down, gently exhaling a breath of turbid air before asking, "If this overseas island is big enough, will there be a land deity stationed here?"

Liu Zhi Cheng shook his head, rolling his eyes, "No, and even if there were, it would starve to death. Once the myriad mountain and water deities lose their good men and believers, the so-called golden body is immortal becomes a joke."

Gu Can looked around and asked, "Is there something akin to a river deity in this vast sea, of course, that lewd deity, but able to dominate a territory in the sea? For example, the Jiao Long Gorge near Hanging Mountain has many Jiao Long descendants gathering there, surpassing the sect in power."

It was said that if one could look down into the Jiao Long Gorge, the clear water sparkled, with strands of Jiao Long swimming in the air like threads.

Liu Zhi Cheng shook his head, "Gu Can, since you’ve become a direct disciple of Bai Di City, there’s no need to think about these pointless matters. If you can defeat them, just kill them; if you can’t beat them, simply declare your name."

Gu Can replied, "It’s a matter of habit."

Before Gu Can left home, Zhu Lian had found the Gu residence in the state capital, holding a charcoal cage, claiming it was a return to its rightful owner.

Gu Can hesitated for a moment but still took the charcoal cage, where the ghostly figure of Ma Du Yi, draped in fox fur talismans, and Zeng Ye, who practiced ghostly methods, were guests in Gu Can’s home.

Zhu Lian had said something strange and humorous back then, expressing his willingness to descend the mountain, but he was too busy with trivial matters to disturb Young Master Gu.

Because the mountain lord had said that whenever Gu Can returned home, he would return this item to him.

The precondition was that Gu Can had to bring Zeng Ye and Ma Du Yi along. If not, the charcoal cage would remain at the Lopan Mountain, as if it had never existed.

Gu Can carried the charcoal cage a distance, escorting the hunched old man to the corner.

Later, when Gu Can returned to his study at home, that master appeared, pulling out a small mud eel with nascent intelligence from the charcoal cage, chuckling before tossing it back.

At that moment, Gu Can’s expression remained unchanged.

Later, when Gu Can left home, he didn’t take the charcoal cage with him, only asking Ma Du Yi and Zeng Ye to send it to a mountain deity's residence located north of the Great Li capital.

His mother had urged Gu Can to visit the north, saying his father was now a high-ranking deity at that mountain deity’s residence. That mountain shrine had originally been the celestial abode of the old Great Li’s Da Yue Mountain deity, just promoted to be the heir of the North Yue's Pei Yun Mountain. It was akin to being promoted to the first rank in the officialdom of the Great Li court, comparable to a minister, not something a prefect or supervisor could match. It was no wonder his father didn’t return to see him; he had serious responsibilities and could not leave his post. Moreover, there were many strange taboos and clashes between mountain and water, making it too numerous to count. Therefore, as a son, visiting family while also offering congratulations was a journey worth taking.

Gu Can remained silent, refusing to nod.

His mother secretly wept, unwilling to urge further, wiping her tears with a handkerchief while glancing at her son’s expression. She truly didn’t dare to say anything more.

On the shore of the great sea, that person appeared.

Chai Bo Fu’s heart tightened; he didn’t even dare to breathe.

Liu Zhi Cheng was also reluctant to approach.

His senior brother was a divine being; it was best to observe from a distance.

Gu Can flew towards that direction, discovering the lord of Bai Di City squatting by the sea, scooping up a handful of water.

Gu Can asked, "What is this?"

The man replied, "Measuring the sea water."

Gu Can questioned further, "What’s the significance?"

The man smiled, "Must it have meaning?"

He released his hand and stood up.

A moment later, Gu Can vaguely saw an endless expanse of ocean suddenly manifest a white horse, galloping across the waves, dragging out a long trail of brilliant light.

On the horse’s back was a set of red armor, rising and falling with the horse’s movements, yet no one was inside.

The horse came towards the island, suddenly stopping. Once it stood still, it seemed as though the sea water had also solidified.

Liu Zhi Cheng couldn’t contain himself and approached the senior brother and Gu Can, smiling, "What luck! To encounter a lone rider of the South Sea in this vast ocean is akin to finding a needle in the ocean."

Gu Can had never heard of such a lone rider from the South Sea.

He then saw the rider produce a golden spear, aiming it straight at the island, seemingly inquiring about their origins.

Then, in an instant, the lone rider of the South Sea retracted the spear, turned the horse's head, and galloped away.

Gu Can noticed that the man beside him had already disappeared.

Liu Zhi Cheng laughed, "That great demon in the Lushui Pit is going to have a hard time. The fire dragon deity couldn’t break the restrictions, but my senior brother could charge through effortlessly."

Gu Can asked, "Does Master have a grudge against that great demon of Lushui Pit? Or is it purely for the sake of accumulating merit by slaying a great demon?"

Liu Zhi Cheng said, "Don’t speculate blindly. My senior brother acts according to his own desires."

Gu Can frowned and remained silent.

Liu Zhi Cheng, seeing Gu Can’s expression, remarked, "Your mindset has been overshadowed too much by Chen Ping’an's reasoning; be careful not to provoke my senior brother."

Gu Can feigned ignorance. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 803: Freedom and Long Journeys (Part Two)

The three of them took a short break on the island. After finally accumulating some spiritual energy, Chai Bofu reluctantly resumed his journey alongside the other two.

In his past as a Golden Core cultivator, his cave dwelling had been as extravagant as a wealthy family estate, with spiritual energy as plentiful as gold and jade, allowing for unrestrained indulgence. Now, as a minor and humble cultivator, he could no longer afford such luxury.

The waterways stretched endlessly, and as they passed a certain spot, Liu Chicheng exclaimed with delight, "Gu Can! You’re truly fortunate! Traveling with you, how can we lack for adventures? First, we encountered the lone knight of the South Sea, and now we see this place!"

Chai Bofu was puzzled, his vision clouded. Before him lay the vast ocean, devoid of any mystery.

After Liu Chicheng dispelled the illusions, Gu Can's view revealed an island, barren and rocky, with no signs of life.

Liu Chicheng chuckled, "That’s a Resting Dragon Stone. It drifts with the water and doesn’t take root anywhere. In ancient times, there were four of them; one was shattered, and another was refined. The one near Qingming’s Palace in the realm of the celestial beings is also situated in a great body of water, held steady by secret arts. Now, only this one remains in the vast world. It’s too massive and heavy for even immortals to move. However, it can be nudged little by little using mountain-moving techniques, but who would dare? After all, it belongs to someone. This place counts as the domain of that fellow from the Lushui Pit, who is not an easy opponent. Even the Fire Dragon Master, skilled in both water and fire, could only manage to retreat to his underwater lair after a confrontation with him. If it were me facing the Fire Dragon Master, I’d be at a complete loss. But there are some immortal cultivators who follow the Resting Dragon Stone; if they’re lucky, they can pick up rare dragon tears that have fallen from cliffs into the sea—what a fortune that would be!"

An ancient saying goes, "The dragon lurks in Lushui Pit, the fire aids the Solar Palace."

Although the Lushui Pit, once a summer retreat for ancient water deities, still existed, the Solar Palace was rumored to have been completely destroyed.

Gu Can focused on the Resting Dragon Stone.

There were no exhausted dragons resting on its surface.

But once the restrictions were lifted, the atmosphere surged, and at the junction of mountain and water, a thick, unusual substance flowed from the shore into the sea, exuding a distant and intoxicating fragrance. Occasionally, a fleeting light of spirituality flickered on the mountain, resembling precious pearls falling between the rocks.

Liu Chicheng laughed, "What’s there to fear? Let’s go closer to take a look! My senior brother has already charged into the Lushui Pit, and with me here to protect you, what are you afraid of? You should be thinking about how to claim this treasure for yourself! Don’t forget that in our White Emperor City, amidst the colorful clouds, there’s the Yellow River flowing down from the heavens, and the grand sight of carp leaping over the dragon gate. If you were to move this treasure there as a resting place, how many water spirits would remember your benevolence?"

Gu Can replied, "A distant observation is sufficient. It’s merely an external object; coveting its allure will only delay my cultivation."

Liu Chicheng sighed, "You see, on the path of cultivation, many enlightened individuals still choose one or two pleasures, be it fine wine, beautiful women, or the arts, to help pass the monotonous days."

Gu Can stated, "Then let’s talk about it once I achieve enlightenment."

Chai Bofu cautiously interjected, "It seems no one is guarding this Resting Dragon Stone. Such treasures are offered to the heavens; should we not take them?"

As a wild cultivator, he would be blind if he didn’t recognize the value of wealth.

Moreover, Chai Bofu practiced the water-based path, and the dragon-patterned white jade belt around his waist, along with the long string of jade pendants and bottles hanging from it, were all substitutes for the treasures he hadn’t had the chance to acquire.

Liu Chicheng playfully shoved Chai Bofu, grinning, "Brother Long, you go! The fortune Gu Can brought us opens the door wide for you to easily pick up treasures. As for how to split the spoils afterwards, Gu Can will decide. We’re all old friends, so I’m sure Gu Can won’t treat you unfairly."

Chai Bofu felt somewhat reluctant; with the three of them together, he was brave, especially since they had the backing of White Emperor City. But if he were alone, he wouldn’t dare approach the ancient relics of the Resting Dragon Stone.

Gu Can encouraged, "Go ahead."

Chai Bofu's knees buckled, but Liu Chicheng caught him by the neck and tossed him atop the Resting Dragon Stone.

After shaking off the dust, Chai Bofu felt a tingle at the back of his head. Even when he was a Golden Core cultivator, he had only dared to try catching a small dragon or serpent. But now, he had directly fallen into the lair of an ancient dragon; what was going on?

Despite his protests, the youthful Chai Bofu, drawn by a glimmer of treasure, pounced forward like a hungry tiger, leaping several dozen feet to uncover a pearl the size of a jujube from the stone crevices. Stunned, he rubbed the pearl vigorously to clean away some dirt and dust, then blew gently, channeling his water-based spiritual energy to draw out its brilliance. Instantly, it radiated a glow, filling the air with refreshing moisture that was delightful to the senses. Chai Bofu examined the extraordinary treasure in his hands, his expression brimming with joy as he muttered, "This is indeed a dragon pearl of the highest quality! Selling it to an emperor for a crown would fetch at least three months' worth of silver! If used as an accent for a dragon maiden’s celestial attire, many female cultivators would likely be willing to part with two pearls. If I could gather a dozen or so and create a bracelet known as ‘The Pearl in the Palm,’ I hear it’s especially favored by female immortals of the Fifth Realm..."

From afar, Liu Chicheng scoffed, "What a sight! A hungry dog eating feces—just a bit off-putting."

Chai Bofu began to scour the mountain for more pearls, even striking the various rocks to verify their composition.

Gu Can remarked, "The path of a wild cultivator is not easy; the hardships and struggles are not for outsiders to know."

Liu Chicheng chuckled, "Is this sympathy for fellow sufferers?"

Gu Can shook his head, "Just stating a fact."

Liu Chicheng inquired, "When we split the spoils, should we give Brother Long a larger share?"

Gu Can still shook his head, "Not a single cent."

Liu Chicheng burst into laughter.

Gu Can asked, "Since there are celestial masters who can use mountain techniques to seek treasures from the Resting Dragon Stone, now that the restrictions are lifted, won’t someone come here soon?"

Liu Chicheng smiled, "Most likely."

Upon hearing this, Gu Can took to the winds, heading toward the Resting Dragon Stone.

Liu Chicheng floated alongside him, reminiscing, "Over three thousand years ago, dragons were prominent figures responsible for weather governance, bringing rain and sunshine to the continent. They would often rest here, seeking coolness and respite after their arduous journeys. At times, hundreds of exhausted dragons would rest upon it. But I’ve never seen it myself—my senior brother has."

Gu Can mentioned, "The Daoist text 'Taishang Dongyuan Jing' details the names and responsibilities of one hundred sixteen dragon kings and their respective powers."

Liu Chicheng nodded, "On the sixth of June, common folk sunbathe while the Dragon Palace airs out its dragon robes. Water spirits from various regions often choose this day to come ashore in search of lovers, usually fleeting encounters. The luckiest men might even get to marry into the Dragon Palace. Unfortunately, such romantic fortunes are long gone."

Gu Can asked, "The Resting Dragon Stone wouldn’t simply open its doors and let outsiders take what they want, would it?"

Liu Chicheng shook his head, "Of course not. The Lushui Pit has a fishing immortal stationed here, with cultivation in the Jade Purity Realm and formidable combat skills. However, with me around, they wouldn’t dare act recklessly. Moreover, these pearls and dragon tears are likely beneath the Lushui Pit’s notice. They probably value some unique spiritual artifacts from the shore more than these treasures. Every century, the Lushui Pit throws a summer banquet, and the treasures from the waters have likely been piling up for ages. Over time, they might just be discarded as their luster fades."

The two landed on a cliff at the top of the Resting Dragon Stone. Gu Can crouched down, reaching out to touch the rock, attempting to familiarize himself with the geography.

Liu Chicheng sighed, "This world is often simplified in our understanding; human nature is as thin as paper. Yet when overcomplicated, it only invites trouble. There’s an endless pursuit of knowledge, seeking the infinite with finite means. Why emulate someone else? Why not learn from Chen Ping’an?"

Gu Can replied, "In this world, whether it’s one Liu Chicheng or a hundred, they’re all the same. But having him around makes a significant difference, at least for me."

Liu Chicheng didn’t want to delve into Chen Ping’an too much, fearing it would leave a grudge.

Suddenly, Liu Chicheng grinned, "Looks like some celestial masters are arriving! Oh, and two beautiful ladies as well."

Gu Can shot him a glance.

Liu Chicheng teased, "If that’s the case, I’ll be at your service for the rest of my days, Brother Long!"

Meanwhile, that Brother Long was still diligently searching for treasures on the mountain, earnest and hardworking, though inevitably earning nothing but a few measly coins.

Xun Yuan and Jiang Shangzhen, the new and old leaders of the Yuguizong, had departed from the mountain peak and arrived at the border of the Great Spring Dynasty in the central region of Tongye Continent.

Both concealed their auras and, after landing, walked toward an inn near Fox Town.

Xun Yuan clicked his tongue, "To think he was willing to take the risk."

Jiang Shangzhen lamented, "I didn’t expect Madam Huanxi to be right under my nose, yet I failed to notice her. A grave sin."

Xun Yuan commented, "The Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox is skilled at concealing her presence. I didn’t notice it either. However, the Great Fu Academy had already picked up on some clues, which is why Junzi Zhong Kui established a presence here."

Jiang Shangzhen glanced at the small inn in the distance and smiled, "Outdoor taverns have three advantages: beautiful women, few customers, and homemade liquor."

Xun Yuan also revealed a hint of nostalgia, stroking his beard and smiling, "A charming widow, a drugged tea, a long bench, and a small dagger."

These two leaders, both new and old, undoubtedly had their own share of stories.

To have both a Ascended Master and a Celestial being arriving simultaneously at the Great Spring Dynasty was certainly to ascertain the true intentions of Madam Huanxi.

If she could be utilized by the Yuguizong, that would be ideal. Thus, Xun Yuan brought Jiang Shangzhen along. Dealing with women was a talent Jiang Shangzhen had possessed since birth.

Suddenly, Xun Yuan changed his mind, "I’ll head to the Great Spring Capital first."

Jiang Shangzhen didn’t mind. After the old leader shrank the landscape, he took out an oil-paper umbrella from his storage and stepped outside. A moment later, dark clouds gathered, and light rain began to fall.

He opened the umbrella and walked.

As he walked, his robe glimmered with spiritual light, transforming into a blue shirt.

Scholars often have many romantic encounters; they don’t deceive.

Outside the store hung a tattered sign.

Jiang Shangzhen felt a pang of nostalgia for the Lotus Blossom Paradise.

He wondered if his friend Lu Fang had resolved his heartaches.

An old hunchback was sitting by the kitchen curtain, puffing on a pipe. He noticed the guest entering with an umbrella and squinted his eyes.

A young man with a limp was wiping the table, somewhat surprised by the sleeping dog outside and muttered, "Customers have arrived, and no one’s here to announce it. I could just kill that dog for soup." He caught sight of the oil-paper umbrella in the guest's hand, then glanced at the hazy rain outside, cursing the unpredictable weather. Facing the guest, he immediately put on a smiling face, "Esteemed guest, are you here for a meal or a place to stay? Our green plum wine and roasted whole lamb are top-notch—fair prices too! We have three types of wine: drink the six-month brew, and you won’t regret it; drink the three-year brew, and you won’t want to leave; drink the five-year brew, and you won’t find another like it in the world."

Jiang Shangzhen ordered a jar of the five-year brew, a whole roasted lamb, and a plate of each of their side dishes.

The young attendant’s face lit up with joy, and the old hunchback went to the kitchen.

As the attendant brought the wine to the table, Jiang Shangzhen smiled and asked, "I’ve heard things aren’t peaceful here; is there something dirty going on in the town?"

The attendant froze for a moment, recalling the events from years ago. He laughed, "Are you referring to Fox Town? There’s nothing dirty here anymore; it’s quite stable. Besides, right next door is the Armored Army Town, full of vitality! Back then, when Fox Town had issues, no one died. Why do you ask?"

Jiang Shangzhen pointed to himself and said, "Can’t you see?"

The young man tentatively responded, "You’re not short on money?"

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, "I’m a cultivator from the mountains. Wherever there are demons causing trouble, I’ll go."

The young man’s eyes brightened, "A cultivator? You know celestial arts? Can you try passing through walls right now?"

Jiang Shangzhen touched his forehead and said, "Celestial arts shouldn’t be displayed lightly; the law forbids easy transmission."

The young man immediately lost interest.

After some pointless chatter, it was as if nothing had been said.

Moreover, the young man had never seen a cultivator boasting about themselves.

This guy could chat all he wanted, but if he didn’t pay the bill, he’d get cut down.

Jiang Shangzhen asked, "Where’s the innkeeper?"

The young man looked at him with increasing suspicion, already calculating how much he could pawn the innkeeper’s clothes for. He replied, "The boss lady went to Fox Town early this morning and hasn’t returned. There’s a temple fair over there, quite lively. But with this weather, I reckon she’ll be back early today. If you’re staying, you’ll surely see her."

After finishing his meal and feeling stuffed, Jiang Shangzhen patted his belly, turned, and looked towards the entrance.

A beautiful woman had just borrowed an oil-paper umbrella from Fox Town, hurrying back. She wore a yellow flower-patterned front-closing shirt and embroidered shoes, scraping the mud off her soles at the threshold.

Jiang Shangzhen waved, "Ninth Lady, Ninth Lady, come sit here!"

The woman looked puzzled, "Do we know each other? I remember all the guests who’ve drunk here and none look as good as you."

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, "You may not recognize me, but I know you, Ninth Lady. I’m a good brother of Chen Ping’an. My name is Zhou Fei."

The woman’s eyes sparkled, and she smiled, "Brother Zhou, how rude of you! You should call me sister-in-law!"

That was a tall tale, easily spun. 

The truth, however, was often buried deep in the heart, and one was usually reluctant to touch it.

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, "In the end, I’m still not as 'familiar' as you, Ninth Lady."

The woman looked confused.

Jiang Shangzhen sighed, "My other name is Jiang Shangzhen. Ninth Lady, since you’ve lost a tail, even if you’re in Fox Town, you couldn’t sense the presence of an immortal like me."

Jiang Shangzhen then smiled, "Madam Huanxi, it would be better if you called me in a more affectionate manner."

In an instant, the world fell silent.

The woman’s eight tails swayed, her expression hardened, and the drunkenness vanished, "I wonder, Master Jiang, have you come from afar to slay demons or to capture them?"

Jiang Shangzhen lifted his wine bowl, gently clinking it with the bowl before Ninth Lady, taking a sip, "If it were just my old friend Xun Yuan coming alone, your question would be appropriate."

The woman frowned, "Master Jiang, please speak plainly."

Jiang Shangzhen set down his wine bowl and said, "Xun Yuan’s intention is for you to agree to be a vassal of the Yuguizong. I think it’s better to refrain from being so abrupt, and instead, consider visiting the Yuguizong as a guest. Once the world is truly at peace, and it’s suitable for hosts and guests to enjoy wine together, Ninth Lady, you could return here to do business. I can guarantee that when you leave the Yuguizong, no one will obstruct you. If you’re willing to stay, dedicate yourself to cultivation, and return as a celestial fox, that would be even better."

The Nine-Tailed Celestial Fox, or Madam Huanxi, responded with a cold laugh, "What if I refuse?"

Jiang Shangzhen replied, "Then you die."

Her visage blurred for a moment before clarifying again, yet it was no longer the face of Ninth Lady.

Jiang Shangzhen didn’t shift his gaze, staring intently at her face, shaking his head with a smile, "Your fox charm techniques hold little sway over me or Chen Ping’an."

She gradually returned to her ‘Ninth Lady’ appearance, saying, "Jiang Shangzhen, I can go with you to the Yuguizong, but you must agree to three conditions."

"First, keep my identity concealed. Apart from you and Xun Yuan, no one in the Yuguizong is allowed to know my true roots."

"That’s reasonable."

"Second, the Third Master and the little cripple must be well taken care of, but without going to the Yuguizong."

"That’s possible; the lower sect of the Yuguizong, the Zhenjing Sect, is in the Baoping Continent and can go on a distant trip to enjoy the mountains and rivers. As for the Great Spring Capital, it’s best not to go."

"Lastly, I want to visit the Great Spring Capital."

"I’m more than willing. I have an old acquaintance there."

The one who sharpens the knives, Liu Zong.

She asked, "How can I trust you?"

Jiang Shangzhen stated with conviction, "I am a friend of Chen Ping’an."

On that day, Ninth Lady closed the inn and left with Jiang Shangzhen for the Great Spring Capital.

In the palace of the Great Spring Dynasty, a woman leaned against a column, tears streaming down her face.

There are truly no salacious matters, nor are there any indecent fox-like individuals.

But the entire literary world of the Great Spring Dynasty was unwilling to let her go, with endless rumors of private publications that were far from decent.

Did these well-read men only know how to bully a woman?

Around the same time, the young Hidden Officer was just thrown into prison, encountering the seamstress for the first time.

Pei Qian was preparing for a long journey.

The kind that involves being far from her master, truly leaving home for thousands of miles.

Early in the morning, Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Mili began helping Pei Qian pack her belongings. Zhou Mili carried a golden small shoulder pole, inquiring if she should bring it along. If they encountered a situation where silver was urgently needed, they could pawn it to a shop and redeem it once they had the money. However, the girl in black didn’t forget to remind Pei Qian that when exchanging gold for silver, there would be a premium, and she mustn’t get tricked by the shopkeeper. Pei Qian praised her verbally, pinching Zhou Mili's cheek, "Look at how clever you are." However, Pei Qian didn’t agree, saying she had enough money on her, and carrying the golden pole while traveling the rivers and lakes would attract envy and jealousy.

This time Pei Qian was setting out to travel with Li Huai across the North Julu Continent, planning to meet at the small town of Yang’s Inn, and then head to the Niujiao Mountain ferry, taking the intercontinental ferry of the Pima Sect. Unfortunately, their own dragon boat, "Fanmoke," couldn’t travel that far.

The old cook took a small summer coin and three hundred snowflake coins from the treasury of the sect and handed them to Pei Qian, startling her. She only accepted a few snowflake coins, realizing that it was her master and the foundation of the Falling Mountain Sect, borrowing too much wouldn’t be good. The old cook insisted it wasn’t a loan but a gift; every disciple of Falling Mountain Sect would receive a sum of celestial money when embarking on a long journey, as the young master said it would bring good fortune.

Pei Qian said, "I’m the chief disciple, how can I be treated the same?"

She was indeed worried about taking too much and losing too much. The old cook had given her a nickname for being ungrateful, and how many times had he called her out over the years? Seventy-two times! 

Moreover, over these years, following her master, she had enjoyed the best food and drink, receiving gifts everywhere, and she was frugal, known as a notorious miser, saving up quite a bit of private wealth. For this journey, she had prepared a small bag of golden leaves and a bag of silver coins.

The walking stick gifted by her master was now adorned with the golden thread presented by the sword immortal Zhou Cheng. The old cook had invited Wei Shanjun to inspect it, confirming there were no issues; it was a good omen that didn’t require refining. Just practicing the Mad Demon Sword Technique a few more times would suffice.

She also brought a small bamboo box made by the big white goose, along with a bamboo knife and sword, but Pei Qian didn’t dare hang them at her waist. After all, she wasn’t on her home mountain, and her master and little junior brother weren’t around. She lacked the courage, fearing being mistaken for a true river and lake person. If a conflict arose unnecessarily, it would be troublesome. People might let her off because of her young age, but if they saw her holding bamboo weapons, they would insist on challenging her to a duel—what a hassle that would be!

Pei Qian visited the Mountain God Temple at the mountain peak to say her farewells.

Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Mili, now her little followers, were growing quickly, making them appear more like young ladies.

The Mountain God was named Song Yuzhang, and his record in the chronicles of Huaihuang County mentioned he had served as a kiln supervisor for several years. Strictly speaking, he had overseen her master as an apprentice at the dragon kiln for quite a while.

Pei Qian knew that Song Yuzhang had never had a good relationship with Falling Mountain and had fallen out with the old cook and Wei Shanjun.

However, her master had once told her that Song Yuzhang had been a loyal minister and a pure scholar in life, and in death, he was a protective spirit. Not everyone who didn’t get along with Falling Mountain or was incompatible was a bad person.

Pei Qian returned to the bamboo building, standing for a moment at the entrance to the second floor.

At first, Zhou Mili wanted to follow her upstairs but was stopped by Chen Nuanshu, who took her to the stone table at the cliff's edge to crack melon seeds.

Pei Qian descended from the second floor, walking along the extra two small paths that led from the bamboo building to the stone table, a short distance.

When her master traveled to the North Julu Continent years ago, he had collected thirty-six blue bricks. Before heading to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had paved six small paths, each embedded with blue bricks spaced irregularly to help pure martial artists practice the six-step stance. The original intention was for her master, herself as the chief disciple, the old cook, Zheng Dafeng, Lu Baixiang, and Cen Yuji to each have a small path.

Later, the big white goose felt wronged, so her master gave his path to the goose.

Pei Qian’s path was adjacent to the one shared by her master and little junior brother.

The old cook gifted his path to Cao Qinglang, saying that although he wasn’t a pure martial artist, practicing martial arts occasionally would still help him focus.

Zheng Dafeng also didn’t keep his blue brick but gave it to a serious young man named Yuan Lai, who preferred reading.

Lu Baixiang gifted his path to his senior disciple Yuan Bao.

Although Cen Yuji had paved a small path in the courtyard, he still preferred to practice the six-step stance up and down the mountain.

To the north lay the gray hills, a territory of Falling Mountain vassals, smaller than Falling Mountain but larger in area, with very different soil and climate.

There were only three people over there, one a young man from a foreign land who spoke only the official language of Dali, who went by the name Shao Po Xian. He was accompanied by a devoted servant named Meng Long, who had quite the spirit. There was also an older sister named Shi Qiu, who was gentle in temperament and even softer in heart, and Pei Qian naturally preferred the latter.

At the far west was the Sword-Folding Platform, where a man named Cui Wei practiced his sword. He was reticent and never descended the mountain. Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qi occasionally went to help at the Dragon Riding Alley shop.

Cui Wei was a Golden Core sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall, brought back by the big white goose. Pei Qian now clearly understood the weight of a Golden Core earth immortal sword cultivator on the Baoping Continent.

Sister Xiuxiu’s Dragon Spring Sword Sect was an immortal sect, and Master Ruan had taken in two batches of disciples, with only one Golden Core disciple holding a summit ceremony, and that Dong Gu wasn’t even a sword cultivator.

Of course, this was because Sister Xiuxiu didn’t like to make a fuss.

But Cui Wei was always polite to the old cook, to the point of reverence and even fear. It was a strange matter.

Had the old cook poisoned Cui Wei’s food?

Even though the old cook had treated the embroidery River Spirit quite harshly, Cui Wei, as a Golden Core sword cultivator, shouldn’t have been so restrained.

Liu Chongrun had brought the direct disciples from the Zhulake Bamboo Pearl Island to rent the Back of the Crab Fish from Falling Mountain, and their relationship was harmonious.

Pei Qian admired Liu Yi greatly, having heard from the old cook that she was a true princess, who listened to affairs from behind a curtain. Such things Pei Qian had only read about in books but were real experiences for her.

A few years ago, Liu Chongrun had even personally taken charge of the dragon boat ferry, selling celestial goods from Longyue Garden brought from Niujiao Mountain. This Liu Yi was loyal and dedicated and made quite a fortune!

Chen Nuanshu said that the Falling Mountain treasury received a significant sum of celestial money each quarter, making money second only to the income from the Niujiao Mountain ferry and Wei Shanjun’s share. Compared to the two shops in the Dragon Riding Alley, it was far more lucrative.

Sometimes when Pei Qian went to the Dragon Riding Alley and saw Shi Rou, she couldn’t help but sigh, feeling embarrassed for her. How could she be the manager of a shop?

And every time during festivals, Chen Nuanshu would visit the Dragon Spring Sword Sect, the gray hills, the Sword-Folding Platform, and of course, the Back of the Crab Fish, delivering gifts—these were all Falling Mountain specialties, light gifts with heavy sentiment. The sisters at the Back of the Crab Fish would also return the gestures.

Pei Qian would always follow Chen Nuanshu, and in the past, Zhou Mili would tag along, but now, she was too timid, preferring to stay at Falling Mountain. Every time, she would find an excuse, claiming a sprained ankle or a toothache. Eventually, that young girl, who didn’t like to think, likely felt genuinely unwell and secretly went to the old cook, resulting in getting a large sheet of paper filled with various excuses about why today was not suitable for traveling far, which made Zhou Mili so happy. Every day, she would eagerly ask Chen Nuanshu why she hadn’t gone down the mountain yet.

One day, Pei Qian secretly hid that piece of paper, and the next night, before sleeping, she would glance at it. The young girl stared blankly, panicking so much that she searched every corner of the Zise Peak’s Ancestor Hall, the main road up Falling Mountain, and all the secluded paths. Late at night, the black-clad girl, wide-eyed, focused on the ground below, and Pei Qian "kindly helped," using a hand gesture to cast a spell, spewing out random commands, then lightly shouted a decree, twisting her wrist to produce that sheet of paper.

With an expression of shock, the young girl clapped vigorously before jumping up and snatching the paper to hide it in her sleeve. On the way home, she chattered excitedly around Pei Qian, asking what kind of celestial technique that was and whether it could bring coin to their home as guests. If so, she’d invite the master to show off his divine powers and command the mountain lord to return home as well.

There was a great snake in Huanghu Mountain, a place where Chen Lingjun often went to play. Sister Jiu’er’s master, Old Daoist Jia Sheng, had originally left the Caotou shop to cultivate there, and it was said that he had mysteriously broken through. According to Chen Lingjun, the old Daoist was so delighted that he shouted by the lake, causing countless birds to flee from their branches and fish to dive to the bottom.

When Old Daoist Jia visited Falling Mountain, the old cook had given him a celebratory gift. The old Daoist had refused several times, saying it was unnecessary, as they were all family and there was no need for such expense.

Pei Qian, sharp-eyed, noticed that as the old cook intended to avoid giving red envelopes, the blind old Daoist seemed to have opened his heavenly eye, taking the lead and accepting the red envelope containing two small summer coins, stroking his beard and smiling, mumbling about not being able to refuse such kindness.

Pei Qian took a deep breath and told her two good friends, "You don’t have to send me off."

Holding her walking stick in one hand and gripping the bamboo box’s rope with the other, she dashed off, leaping high and jumping off the cliff.

The mountain wind howled in her ears, and during the fall, Pei Qian wondered when she could leap from Falling Mountain to the gray hills to the north.

The young girl yawned.

Bending her knees slightly, she landed heavily, sending dust flying.

As she retracted her fists, the girl squatted down, her fingertips gently pressing against the ground. The dust that had just been disturbed obediently returned to the earth.

Familiarity breeds skill; it was nothing remarkable.

Zhu Lian arrived at the stone table, followed by Wei Ban.

Zhou Mili waved vigorously at the cliff’s edge, unconcerned about whether Pei Qian saw her farewell.

Chen Nuanshu worried about the bags of dried creek fish, seeds, and pastries within Pei Qian’s traveling chest and whether she would have enough to eat on the road.

Zhu Lian rubbed his chin, "Only a Sixth Realm martial artist going on such a long journey makes me uneasy. Plus, she’s taking a different route than Chen Lingjun."

Wei Ban sighed, "Only 'a sixth'?"

Zhu Lian laughed.

Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Mili bowed to Wei Shanjun.

Wei Ban nodded with a smile.

Zhou Mili looked down, rummaging through her sleeve for a long time, finally handing Wei Shanjun a small handful of seeds, feeling a bit embarrassed. She felt she hadn’t been a proper hostess. She was the right protector of Falling Mountain, the vice leader, the big water monster from Yazi Lake, and had even self-appointed herself as the manager of the New Year’s shop!

Wei Ban stifled a laugh, waving his hand, "It’s fine, it’s fine."

Chen Nuanshu took his leave and continued with his busy work; there were still plenty of trivial matters at Falling Mountain. Zhou Mili carried her small golden shoulder pole, cracking seeds as she went. Although she worried about the leader traveling the rivers and lakes, as the vice leader, she had no way to intervene.

After the two little girls walked far away, Wei Ban continued the previous topic, "With Li Huai around, it shouldn’t be a problem. Besides, as she journeys, Pei Qian might just step into the Golden Body realm. We should worry more about those reckless martial artists and malevolent spirits, right? I can't make sense of Pei Qian’s martial arts training; it’s completely illogical."

Zhu Lian said, "When younger generations travel far, the elders always worry about their well-being. However, Pei Qian should be the one to step out into the world."

Wei Ban replied, "If you’re really that worried, why not accompany her? I can help you watch over things here at Falling Mountain."

Zhu Lian rubbed his hands, "No need, no need, Brother Wei. You should focus entirely on preparing for the Night Banquet. It’s not every day we find a mountain suitable for a crown prince; we shouldn’t miss the opportunity. Just look at the Mount Zhongyue Lord Jin Qing; hasn’t he been doing splendidly?"

Thinking of this made Wei Ban feel exhausted. He asked, "Besides the mountain spirits within the jurisdiction of the North Yue, who else would come?"

Recently, a humorous saying had begun circulating among the mountains of the Great Li Dynasty: the North Yue jurisdiction was nothing but the sounds of pots and pans clanging.

Suddenly, Wei Ban said, "Those spies from Qingfeng City—little snot-nosed brats—are they praying to you at the mountain?"

Zhu Lian asked, "Did someone burn incense at your mountain?"

Wei Ban nodded, "Three sticks of incense. The first two were ordinary, so I ignored them. The last stick was of high quality, and with three different interpretations, I started paying attention."

Zhu Lian chuckled, "Most likely it’s a chess piece Gu Can buried for years, thinking the time was ripe to come and pay respect. Coincidentally, I was about to visit Qingfeng City to see the Xu family. It’s about time I returned the favor."

Wei Ban said, "No rush; I’ll meet this person first."

Zhu Lian laughed, "Much appreciated, I’ll ask for some seeds from Nuanshu later."

Wei Ban transformed into a breeze and disappeared in an instant.

Zhu Lian gazed at the sky, where snowflakes threatened to fall. He murmured, "The poetic thoughts have been on the back of a donkey in the blizzard on the Baqiao Bridge. I haven’t composed poetry in a long time. The thoughts are always there, the snow and wind are constant, but there’s no donkey. Even if there was, it would probably be Pei Qian leading it away to the rivers and lakes."

Zhu Lian smiled knowingly.

When the young master returns home next time, he would probably be even less willing to let Pei Qian practice her punches on him.

Li Huai’s packing was quite simple, carrying a large bamboo box filled with bottles and jars of dried fish and pickled vegetables. He didn’t bring any treasured items; in the rivers and lakes, where the fish and dragons mix, it was better to keep a low profile.

He went to the apothecary to say goodbye to the old man. Old Yang gifted him a set of traveling clothes— a long blue robe, a bamboo-like garment, a blank jade token, and a pair of boots.

At first, Li Huai didn’t intend to accept them; the apothecary had been struggling with business, and it was quite harsh to make money. After all these years, he probably hadn’t saved much.

With his father gone from the shop and Uncle Zheng traveling to distant lands, the two new disciples, Su Dian and Shi Ling, had also left. Li Huai genuinely felt uneasy, not wanting to accept the old man’s things.

But the old man said, "If you don’t want them, it’s fine. Just pass them to the guy behind the counter."

Li Huai nearly lost his temper. If he weren’t a Confucian disciple, needing to maintain some scholarly demeanor and decorum, he might have wanted to give that guy, who looked like a misfit, a good beating.

This was Pei Qian’s first time visiting Yang’s shop, and it was the first time she met Old Yang.

The young girl respectfully sat on a long bench opposite him.

She had already started to grow taller, becoming somewhat slender and thin, her skin slightly dark, not particularly pretty.

When Pei Qian first entered the back courtyard, she saw the old man sitting on the steps while Li Huai squatted beside him, his hand around the old man’s neck, mumbling something to him.

Pei Qian remembered her master’s teachings: unless necessary, she shouldn’t pry into others’ minds.

Old Yang gazed at the young girl, slowly saying, "This long bench has been sat upon by Qi Jingchun, and your master has also rested here."

Pei Qian, sitting up straight, lightly nodded.

Just then, Li Huai slapped the old man on the head, imitating Zhou Mili’s way of speaking, "What’s this? Trying to scare my friends with ghost stories? Just because you’re old?"

Pei Qian shot Li Huai a glare.

Li Huai immediately patted the old man’s head, helping to smooth his hair.

The old man had long since grown used to it and didn’t mind. Of course, only Li Huai was an exception. What if someone like Tianjun Xie Shi or Sword Immortal Cao Xi tried that?

The old man said, "You may set off now."

Li Huai and Pei Qian walked toward the bamboo curtain. Li Huai turned and said, "Old man, I bought a big bag of charcoal and left it in the side room. In this cold winter, don’t be stingy; it won’t cost you anything."

The old man nodded.

Pei Qian slightly bowed and clasped her hands in salute.

The old man nodded again.

This year, this month, this day.

In the night, atop a half-ruined section of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The shadow that had appeared there at some point gradually became clearer, with golden eyes glaring brightly, adorned in a bright red robe, and a narrow blade hanging at the waist.

This half of the Sword Qi Great Wall no longer had any reckless demons trying to climb it or winds sweeping past.

Therefore, those painted sword immortals had temporarily hidden themselves.

The shadow wandered back and forth atop the wall, suddenly appearing and quickly vanishing without a trace.

At this moment, the shadow drew out the narrow blade and stood at the edge of the wall, overlooking the earth below, where an innumerable army of demons surged northward.

He retracted his gaze and looked up.

Now in this wild world, only two moons remained.

I’m fine; I just wonder if those who travel far will return safely.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 804: A Few Anecdotes

Guihua Island finally returned to Old Dragon City. As the island slowly docked, the journey back had gone surprisingly smoothly, leaving everyone feeling relieved.

The three of them departed from the Gui Mai Courtyard. Wei Jin carried his sword on his back, while Mi Yu wore a sword at his waist and had a wine gourd hanging by his side. Wei Wenlong, with empty hands, disembarked and headed toward Old Dragon City. A sea route had been established between the island and Old Dragon City. Guihua’s little miss, Jin Su, under the instruction of her master, Madam Gui, escorted the three esteemed guests to another dock in Old Dragon City, where they would change ferries and continue along the Long Dragon Path to the central region of Baoping Continent.

Between the two docks in Old Dragon City, one on land and the other over the sea, lay the hundred-mile-long street belonging to the Sun family’s ancestral business.

Originally, the chief elder of the Guihua Island, the Golden Core sword cultivator Ma Zhi, wanted to call for a carriage for Wei Jin, but Wei Jin politely declined, stating that walking was sufficient.

Jin Su held a deep admiration for this young sword immortal from the Wind and Snow Temple. First, she inquired about the Northern Julu Continent’s Celestial Lord, Xie Shi, and then set off to slay demons at the Great Wall of Sword Qi, only to have recently returned.

As the youngest upper-tier immortal in Baoping Continent’s history, Wei Jin was indeed deserving of the title. Jin Su could assert that upon Wei Jin’s return from his travels at the Great Wall of Sword Qi, he would undoubtedly bolster the prestige of the Wind and Snow Temple tremendously.

According to some early rumors, the truth of which was uncertain yet intriguing, it was said that Wei Jin had been able to practice in a hut atop the Great Wall of Sword Qi, diligently nurturing his sword, enjoying a unique status where he had become neighbors with an old immortal, the highest sword master of the Great Wall. It was rumored that Wei Jin often received guidance in swordsmanship from this elder.

This had earned much discussion among the Qi cultivators of Baoping Continent, and every time the topic arose, they felt a sense of pride. Now, whenever practitioners spoke of sword cultivators, they could not avoid mentioning Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple.

Although Baoping Continent was the smallest among the Nine Continents of the Vast Realm, wasn’t our fellow townsman Wei Jin an exceptional presence amidst the myriad sword immortals at the Great Wall of Sword Qi?

Some celestial masters even began to speculate that if the Celestial Lord Qi Zhen of the Divine Revelation Sect ascended or fell into prolonged seclusion, the next leader of the continent’s immortals might very well be Wei Jin. Should Wei Jin reach the immortal realm and become the first great sword immortal in Baoping Continent’s history, the heavens and earth would surely aid him, and the sword path’s fortune would gather around him, leading to immeasurable achievements in the Dao.

As for Wei Jin’s two mysterious companions, Jin Su could only treat them with courtesy, hearing that they were both individuals who were just a step away from the Golden Core Earth Immortal stage. At the Gui Mai Courtyard, she occasionally accompanied Madam Gui and the three of them in brewing tea and discussing the Dao, noticing some subtle differences. The guest surnamed Wei seemed rather reserved and not good with words, but showed great interest in the local customs of Baoping Continent, asking about the business directions and profit routes of several prominent families in Old Dragon City, resembling a merchant’s demeanor.

In contrast, the handsome Mi Yu, who looked like a celestial being from a book, appeared to be somewhat indifferent.

Both sides of the road had been crafted into a scenic area reminiscent of Lotus Marsh by the mountain cultivators, thus the path was bustling with people and tourists.

As Mi Yu walked among them, he felt as though he had stepped from the heavens into the mortal realm, akin to a wandering immortal.

Even though Jin Su had already given her heart to Sun Jiashu, she couldn’t help but acknowledge that, speaking purely of looks, this Mi Yu was truly a god among men.

Along the way, many women with bright eyes couldn’t help but steal glances at Mi Yu, often forgetting to admire the beautiful scenery of Lotus Marsh, their eyes lingering on the elegant youth instead.

Where are the immortals? They cultivate elixirs by the wells, and try their inks by the ponds. Ten miles of lotus, clear winds reflecting the waters, and bright moons draped in celestial garments.

Mi Yu murmured the two lines he had seen on a fan from Yan’s shop. It was indeed true that scholars in the Vast Realm possessed great literary talent.

Moreover, in the Vast Realm, if one disregarded the people and only spoke of the scenery, it was undoubtedly far superior to that of the Great Wall of Sword Qi.

Even before reaching Old Dragon City, such sights were already abundant.

At this moment, as they walked, Wei Wenlong couldn’t help but sigh, “This is the hometown of the Hidden Official and the Sword Immortal Wei.”

There was no need for Wei Jin to remind them—the term “Hidden Official” was a somewhat taboo reference, not something to be casually uttered. Even if Wei Wenlong couldn’t help but mention it, he could only do so in thought.

Wei Jin smiled and said, “If it weren’t for traveling far to other continents, it would be hard to call this expansive land our hometown.”

Indeed, Wei Jin had little attachment to Baoping Continent; in fact, he had no sense of belonging even to the Wind and Snow Temple.

Jin Su pointed to the sky above Old Dragon City and introduced to her two foreign companions, “In the past, our Old Dragon City had a Sea of Clouds. It was rumored to be the remnant of an ancient immortal artifact of at least semi-immortal rank. One could take a cloud ferry and overlook it, but while in the city, it was out of sight. However, it mysteriously vanished a few years ago, becoming a strange tale among the mountains. Many Qi cultivators have traveled here to verify the truth of the rumors.”

Wei Wenlong instinctively began to consider the value of a semi-immortal artifact in Baoping Continent.

Mi Yu, appearing calm, communicated with Wei Jin through thought, “Does Baoping Continent truly have so many idle folks?”

Wei Jin, already having a good impression of Mi Yu, responded casually, “That sort of talk could be said by any sword immortal at the Great Wall of Sword Qi, but only you, Mi Yu, lack the qualifications to be sarcastic. Drunkenly pretending to be an immortal and fooling the female cultivators from other lands, racking up a mountain of romantic debts and entanglements.”

Mi Yu laughed heartily, “You really shouldn’t bring that up! No wonder you, Sword Immortal Wei, are still single. How many sword immortals are there in Baoping Continent? There are only a few! A dignified sword immortal, yet so young, hardly any beautiful acquaintances. I truly can’t tell if it’s the goddesses of Baoping Continent who have poor taste, or if you, Wei Jin, are simply dimwitted. Do you stick a note on your forehead saying ‘not fond of women’ every time you traverse the mountains? Come on, stop being shy, Sword Immortal Wei! We’re all friends here! Quickly show us that note so that I and Brother Wei can broaden our horizons!”

Wei Jin chuckled, “I truly don’t have such a note; you’ll be disappointed, Mi Sword Immortal.”

Jin Su only knew that the three were communicating through thought but was unaware of the content of their cheerful conversation.

A carriage stopped in the middle of the road after Guihua Island docked. A young man wearing a high crown and carrying a “Old Dragon Rain Cloth” jade pendant stepped down.

He was Fu Nanhua, the young lord of Old Dragon City.

Upon seeing Wei Jin and the others, he bowed and clasped his fists, “Junior Fu Nanhua, pays respects to Sword Immortal Wei.”

Wei Jin nodded, “There’s no need to trouble yourself; we’re in a hurry.”

Had it not been for Jin Su standing nearby, Wei Jin might not have spoken a word. In the martial world, he could chat jovially with those rough martial artists, but he never bothered to be friendly with those from the mountains.

Fu Nanhua stepped aside, smiling, “I wouldn’t dare disturb Sword Immortal Wei. I’ve come this time merely out of admiration, and it’s already quite rude.”

After leaving the sea route, the group flew forward toward the next dock.

Mi Yu clicked his tongue, “Wei Jin, are you so well-regarded here in Baoping Continent?”

Wei Jin laughed, “Am I being insulted?”

Upon reaching the dock, someone recognized the sword immortal from the Wind and Snow Temple first, and an uproar ensued. As Wei Jin landed, people hurriedly cleared a path for the sword immortal.

In Baoping Continent, where sword cultivators were scarce, a local Earth Immortal sword cultivator was already worthy of the title of “such-and-such sword immortal,” let alone Wei Jin, who was a genuine upper-tier sword immortal.

Thus, the people in the distance began to point and whisper, and those closer to Wei Jin were actively paying their respects.

Mi Yu remarked, “Seems like there are quite a few people who want to scold you.”

Wei Jin helplessly replied, “Mi Yu, can you settle down? Otherwise, once we board the ferry, we can find a quiet spot mid-journey and have a sparring session.”

Mi Yu grinned, “I’m not foolish. Same as in the Jade Purity realm, I can only match against Shao Jianxiang of the Spring Flag Pavilion. I’d never be able to match up against Sword Immortal Wei from the Wind and Snow Temple.”

Wei Wenlong, feeling helpless, thought to himself, why drag me into this sparring match between the two sword immortals?

The three bid farewell to Jin Su and boarded a ferry.

Unlike the reclusive Wei Jin, Mi Yu was still reluctant to stay cooped up inside the cabin. He preferred to stand at the bow of the ship, gazing at the mountains and rivers. He turned to Wei Wenlong, smiling, “So, the Vast Realm doesn’t just have islands, but also so many green mountains.”

In the snowy season, the ferry passed by a mountain sect.

Perched on high cliffs, the immortal pavilions and halls were clustered together, creating a stunning sight. From the railing, one could see peculiar pines and strange cypress trees, with flashes of green against the snow, which made one’s eyes widen in astonishment. Such a celestial sight was rare for private individuals to witness.

On a nearby cliff, a man in a blue robe with a long beard stood at the edge, accompanied by eight or nine immortals engrossed in a game of chess. It was unclear who was the host and who was the guest.

Looking down at this unique earthly beauty from afar, the sword immortal Mi Yu appeared as if he were about to cry or laugh.

Wei Jin, rarely stepping out of the cabin, came to Mi Yu’s side and said, “You’ve said it yourself—there aren’t many sword immortals in Baoping Continent. You could travel around, enjoy good wine, and then catch up with the ferry later.”

Mi Yu returned to his normal demeanor, “Forget it, if there are no celestial maidens, there’s no point in going.”

Wei Jin nodded, “Cloudy Mountain, the Fox Kingdom of the Xu family in Qingfeng City, and the Changchun Palace north of the Great Li capital all have quite a few female cultivators.”

Mi Yu laughed and cursed, “I’m a romantic, not a lecher!”

After spending time with the young Hidden Official, Wei Wenlong couldn’t help but mutter quietly, “This matter seems dubious.”

Wei Jin smiled knowingly.

Mi Yu gave him a thumbs up, feeling pleased, “Well said… you have some of the Hidden Official’s charm!”

Suddenly, Mi Yu asked, “‘Planting oranges,’ what’s that anecdote? Is there a story behind it?”

Wei Jin was puzzled and shook his head, “I don’t know.”

Mi Yu shook his head in disappointment, “Wei brother, your knowledge is lacking.”

Wei Jin shrugged it off and returned to the cabin to continue nurturing his sword intent.

Meanwhile, Wei Wenlong went to the ferry to purchase a mountain and water report.

Mi Yu leaned over the railing, thinking about how he would soon be heading to the Fallen Mountain to live off the land and enjoy the legendary Mirror Flower Water Moon. He felt even more delighted.

He just didn’t understand why the Hidden Official kept bringing up the Mirror Flower Water Moon and why every time he mentioned it, there was such a… sincere smile.

This was Li Huai’s first long-distance journey across continents. Previously, he had boarded the ferry from the Horned Mountain, where the heroic puppets dragged the boat through the sea of clouds at lightning speed. During storms, with thunder and lightning, those puppets, clad in golden armor, illuminated the front of the ferry as if the sun and moon were guiding the vessel onward. Li Huai never tired of watching; since there was no viewing platform at his residence, he often went to the bow to admire the scenery, each time surprised and amazed.

Pei Qian, who lived next door, didn’t enjoy going out. At most, she would lean against the window to watch the bizarre celestial phenomena. Li Huai had urged her several times to come to the bow, but Pei Qian always said she had traveled through thousands of mountains and rivers and had seen all sorts of oddities. Instead, she seriously reminded Li Huai to be cautious when going out, not to provoke trouble but also not to be afraid of it. If anything unexpected happened, she would notify Manager Su.

Watching the mature Pei helmsman, as he practiced his martial arts in the slightly cramped cabin, Li Huai felt great admiration. Thus, he genuinely complimented her, but Pei Qian, who was about to start copying books, just flicked him a glare.

The Pi Ma Sect had a deep connection with the Fallen Mountain; the Yuan Ying cultivator Du Wensi, and the promising heir of the Patriarch Hall, Pang Lanxi, both served as honorary disciples of the Fallen Mountain. However, this matter was not widely publicized. Each time the ferry traveled back and forth, significant amounts of wealth exchanged hands between the two sects. Now, the entire income from the Haikou Beach and the Chunlu Garden line essentially encompassed the southeast coastline of the Northern Julu Continent, involving numerous celestial mountains and various trades, all quietly related to the Fallen Mountain.

Owning half of the Horned Mountain ferry, the Fallen Mountain received nearly ten percent of the profits from each round trip made by the Pi Ma Sect’s ferry service, which is a substantial share that required personnel, effort, and resources from both the Pi Ma Sect and their allies.

Thus, the Fallen Mountain and the Pi Ma Sect, located at the southernmost end of the Northern Julu Continent, could be said to have not only a gentlemanly friendship but also a solid financial tie. If their friendship could be recorded in the account books, and both parties could profit, as the business expanded without conflict, then their relationship would indeed be very stable.

The ferry manager, an elderly man surnamed Su, prepared two high-quality rooms to host the esteemed guests. However, upon hearing the price, the girl surnamed Pei refused to stay, insisting that they could simply take two ordinary cabins instead. She even inquired whether it would be troublesome to change their accommodations, suggesting that occupying two premium rooms would reduce the profits for the Pi Ma Sect.

The old manager was used to making deals and had developed a keen eye for such matters. Seeing her sincerity, he spoke frankly, “Mountain cultivators coming to do business in Baoping Continent travel far. As long as there are good rooms available, they wouldn’t mind paying a little more. Especially the young disciples from the Great Li capital, who now love to travel in Northern Julu Continent; each one is more extravagant than the last, so there’s no worry that premium rooms will go unoccupied. But this money, the Pi Ma Sect truly doesn’t care about earning or not.”

After some back and forth, the girl added, “I truly appreciate your kindness, but the price difference is just too large. If we take two premium rooms, it would cause the Pi Ma Sect to lose two small summer coins. I’m here to endure hardship, not to enjoy luxury. If my master finds out, I’ll definitely be punished. So, for the sake of propriety and reason, we should change rooms.”

The old man smiled and handed the girl a “Summer Coin” wooden token, saying that with this token, she could purchase an item worth a summer coin at the Pi Ma Sect’s shop aboard the ferry.

The old manager didn’t give Pei Qian a chance to refuse. Relying on his seniority, he said that not accepting it would hurt their feelings. The girl said, “I wouldn’t dare refuse the elder’s gift,” and accepted the wooden token, bowing to this elder from the Pi Ma Sect.

The manager, surnamed Su and named Xi, was an old Yuan Ying cultivator of the Pi Ma Sect, while the shopkeeper of the Xu Huan Fang was named Huang Shenyun. The two had been old friends and neighbors for nearly three hundred years.

In fact, not long after Pei Qian and Li Huai boarded the ferry, the two idle friends began discussing the two children. The old Yuan Ying said that compared to the previous one named Chen Lingjun, this young girl was much more mature, although he didn’t know how Pei Qian would use the token worth a summer coin.

Shopkeeper Huang was delighted, thinking how rare it was to have a customer who, upon boarding, had earned a summer coin and could also gain a favor. He even spoke a few good words for Chen Lingjun, believing that the young man was quite good. Once familiar, chatting with him would be enjoyable.

Aside from idle chatter, Huang had a serious question, asking his old friend why the Fallen Mountain appeared to look down upon his small business. Otherwise, why would he say he wanted to open a shop at Horned Mountain while the Fallen Mountain had plenty of vacant shops yet claimed they would discuss it later and only promised to leave him the best location?

Old manager Su smiled and reassured his friend, “The young mountain master isn’t at the mountain top, and the one managing affairs in his place, Zhu Lian, for whatever reason, did not allow Xu Huan Fang to open a branch at Horned Mountain. I’m sure they have their own considerations, but it’s definitely not looking down on you, Shopkeeper Huang. The Fallen Mountain still has some principles; they are not sycophants. That Zhu Lian treats people with utmost propriety and is certainly not short-sighted.”

Although Huang understood this reasoning, being turned down still left him feeling somewhat gloomy. He remarked, “The Fallen Mountain has become even larger since we met Chen Ping’an, and that young man hasn’t been at his own mountain for a long time. What will happen in the future? Will he become one of those mountain sects that forget their roots after suddenly gaining wealth? It’s hard to say.”

From Chunlu Garden in Northern Julu Continent to Old Dragon City in Baoping Continent, this invisible route of riches was gradually joined by the Sun and Fan families of Old Dragon City, alongside a young man named Dong Shuijing. Following them were the three prominent families of Great Li, including one of the overseers, Guan Yiran, and the provincial governor of Yuan, who temporarily engaged in small-scale business under their own names.

In fact, Pi Ma Sect could have profited much more, but Lord Wei of the Great Mountain had evenly distributed the benefits to the Fallen Mountain.

Shopkeeper Huang hadn’t truly intended to profit from Horned Mountain; he simply believed in the young man’s character and wished to establish a good connection with the rising Fallen Mountain.

The martial world in Northern Julu Continent is heavily focused on face. Over the years, Shopkeeper Huang had boasted to various friends that he was the first to see that the young mountain master was no ordinary person, a point that even the head of Zhuquan Sect could not surpass. 

The more he thought about it, the more disappointed he became. The celestial money that one cannot bring or take in life is merely a passerby in someone’s money bag. For a Golden Core cultivator with little hope of great Dao, whether they earn a little more or less is insignificant; perhaps it’s not about sipping wine and bragging.

One day, the two friends began drinking again. A woman in charge of the specific business affairs at Xu Huan Fang approached the two elders. After listening, Su Xi joked, “Those two kids are collecting scraps? Why don’t you stop them? Is Xu Huan Fang so heartlessly profit-driven? Good thing I only gave you a summer coin token; otherwise, you’d be unable to open a shop at Horned Mountain in the future.”

Shopkeeper Huang helplessly replied, “I was afraid of complications, so I didn’t mention this to Lingjiao. The main reason is that our shop just happened to undergo a major inventory clearance and found a bunch of old items, many of which are actually muddled accounts, and old friends haven’t repaid their debts, so we accepted them in kind. Many items worth only fifty snowflake coins were taken by Xu Huan Fang at the price of a summer coin.”

The woman in charge, nicknamed Lingjiao, immediately grasped the situation and had a remedy in mind. Just as she was about to speak, the venerable old Su laughed, “No need to worry. Isn’t this good? Later, let Shopkeeper Huang introduce himself as a close friend of Chen Ping’an, and present an item worth a summer coin as a token of goodwill. Otherwise, that girl named Pei Qian wouldn’t accept anything.”

At this point, the old man casually asked the woman, “Having bought a bunch of scraps, is there any chance of getting a bargain?”

The woman smiled wryly and shook her head. “We have a new employee in the shop who recognizes no kin when earning money and dares to sell anything at any price. The few discerning masters in our shop have good eyesight, but those two kids only pick the cheapest items. They might as well continue buying; once they disembark, it’ll be tough to save even ten snowflake coins with a summer coin. By then, Xu Huan Fang will likely be labeled a black shop.”

Shopkeeper Huang looked at her with an unusual expression.

The woman smiled knowingly, aware of the relationship between the two elders, and said, “That new employee has even been praised by our Huang shopkeeper as a good seedling worth nurturing.”

As it turned out, today Pei Qian was in high spirits, holding that summer coin token and took Li Huai to Xu Huan Fang. Li Huai was even more excited, saying it was a coincidence, having checked the almanac, and today was a good day for buying and selling, “Let me handle it!”

They first went to look at the pair of spiritual swords mentioned by their master, feasting their eyes upon them. After all, they couldn’t afford to buy them. The “Rainfall” and “Lamp Sound” were relics of ancient immortal companions, severely damaged, and restoring them to their original state would cost too much—it wasn’t worth it. When their master boarded the ferry, this was one of the treasures of the shop, and now it still hadn’t been sold.

Today’s Xu Huan Fang had an unusually large array of items, leaving Pei Qian dazzled. However, the prices were not cheap. It was indeed true that aboard a celestial ferry, money didn’t mean much.

Li Huai insisted he would only buy cheap items. Originally hesitant, Pei Qian simply handed the wooden token to Li Huai, urging him to try his luck.

Li Huai clasped his hands together, raised them high, rubbing them energetically, murmuring, “Heavenly spirit, may the wealth god be my guest today…”

Pei Qian felt more at ease.

A celestial-grade green porcelain brush washer. Ten snowflake coins.

It looked quite celestial; the porcelain craftsmanship was impeccable, evidently of high quality. Where is Li Huai’s hometown? How could he not know the quality of porcelain? Out of the corner of his eye, Li Huai noticed Pei Qian snickering, worried she might think he was spending carelessly. He lightly tapped the washer with his fingers, producing a clear, pleasant sound. This back-and-forth, along with his nodding, indicated that the item was indeed good. The young clerk beside him also gently nodded, indicating that this buyer had discerning eyes.

An ancient, tattered scroll was unfurled, depicting a fox worshipping the moon. Five snowflake coins. Such a cheap item was rare in Xu Huan Fang!

The young clerk sighed, saying that if the customer was lucky, they should have found a bargain. Just look at this long-neglected painting; although it lacked spiritual energy, just judging by the artistry, with every detail visible, it was already worth five snowflake coins.

A zitan wood stationery box inlaid with gold and silver filigree, accompanied by a pair of exquisite tri-colored lions. Fifteen snowflake coins. Pei Qian found it rare that this transaction didn’t seem to be a loss. The stationery box resembled a treasure box, and once opened, it revealed many compartments, offering great value. Pei Qian had always had a knack for such items.

A bundle of yellow paper charms, tightly bound with two red strings and knotted, standing a foot high. With so many charms folded for years, they were uneven, and only the first and last charms were visible. According to the clerk’s explanation, as long as half of the hundred charms inside had two of a certain grade, it would be a guaranteed profit. This was something a destitute traveler had pawned at the ferry years ago, having promised to redeem it within a hundred years. Yet, many years had passed, and only recently did Xu Huan Fang manage to clear out the inventory, allowing these charms to see the light of day. According to the appraiser’s estimate, the red thread alone, regardless of its material, could easily be worth a snowflake coin.

Lastly, Xu Huan Fang priced it at thirty snowflake coins, but Li Huai, acting somewhat ruthlessly, haggled down to twenty-nine, feeling quite accomplished.

Pei Qian stood by, observing coldly as Li Huai, holding a large bundle of charms, appeared happy, and the clerk was even more delighted with the sale.

Casually dragging the weighty bundle of charms by the red string, Li Huai whispered to Pei Qian, “You can tell there’s a story behind this; we’ve earned something!”

Pei Qian retorted, “A story? Those selling dog skin plaster on the streets can have a thousand ancestral stories! If you want to hear one, I can come up with ten or eight right now!”

Li Huai was taken aback.

Pei Qian pulled Li Huai aside, “Li Huai, can you really handle this? Don’t buy recklessly. We’ve spent an entire summer coin, leaving us with hardly any snowflake coins left. I’ve heard Master say that many mountain items purchased from the south could be worth double if sold properly in the north of Baoping Continent.”

Li Huai froze, thinking to himself that he never had a moment of not buying recklessly.

He had always just gone by his instincts and never cared about prices. If he could afford it, he would buy it; if not, forget it. Once he had it, he never thought about selling it.

Feeling somewhat guilty, Li Huai patted his chest, assuring, “I’ll definitely be more careful next time!”

Pei Qian smacked Li Huai’s head, “Didn’t you look properly before?!”

Li Huai complained, “Should we return these items to Xu Huan Fang?”

Pei Qian was notoriously stingy and petty, and if they truly lost money, Li Huai couldn’t bear the burden. So, he suggested they leave things as they were. To his surprise, Pei Qian angrily retorted, “Are you a fool? We came to Xu Huan Fang to make a profit based on our own skills. If we lose out, it’s worse for us if Xu Huan Fang knows our identity as part of the Fallen Mountain. If they do, next time we come back and spend the remaining snowflake coins, don’t you think we’ll definitely profit? But if we lose out on these few snowflake coins, it costs our master and the Fallen Mountain a share of offerings, so you should weigh it carefully, Li Huai.”

Thus, Pei Qian insisted that Li Huai spend the entirety of the summer coin.

After this, Pei Qian crossed her arms and kept a stern face, watching Li Huai.

Li Huai, feeling anxious, bought a few more items.

Upon returning to Pei Qian’s cabin, all the items, large and small, were carefully placed on the table. Pei Qian opened a new account book, slapping the table, “Li Huai! Open your eyes wide and see clearly what price you paid for these useless items. I’ll record each and every one. If we return home and still have these in hand, you can deal with it yourself.”

Li Huai scratched his head anxiously.

Pei Qian shot him a sideways glance.

Li Huai immediately dropped his hands, silently reminding himself not to show weakness. If he happened to buy something genuine, Pei Qian would still consider it fake. His journey had just begun; he certainly couldn’t let Pei Qian get the better of him. So, Li Huai sat down and gently blew on the green porcelain brush washer, carefully caressing it, whispering to the washer, “Come on, you need to hold your ground. Even if you don't make money, don’t lose value. If Pei Qian ends up losing money, Li Huai is finished.”

“Fate brings us together across a thousand miles; we’ve shared a boat for a hundred years. Let’s all show some brotherhood, part well, and be amicable in business…”

Li Huai raised the brush washer high, noticing its base was peculiar, not inscribed with the national year but rather a line of ancient poetry: “Riding the raft, welcoming immortal guests, once arrived beside the three stars.” 

Li Huai remarked, “I’ve never seen this line of poetry in books.”

Pei Qian, while recording, commented, “How much have you read?”

Li Huai had no response.

Pei Qian set down her brush, clearly delineating, “If we make a loss on this deal, it’s not all your fault; I’ll take half of the blame.”

Li Huai felt relieved.

Pei Qian pondered for a moment, took the bundle of charms, and attempted to untie the tightly knotted red string. Unexpectedly, it proved somewhat challenging. After a long struggle, she finally managed to loosen it and placed the lengthy red thread, measuring over a foot, aside. 

As for the charms, Pei Qian was no stranger. She first pulled out the first and last two sheets of yellow paper charms, both the most ordinary type, not the yellow seal paper used by immortals for entering the mountains and rivers. However, the charms were indeed crafted by Qi cultivators; otherwise, just the large pile of yellow seal paper itself would not be talked about when it came to the complete charms that could nurture spiritual energy. 

As a result, after she pulled out two of the charms, she spread out the entire bundle, her eyes widening in shock.

It was as if a bolt from the blue had struck Li Huai, feeling wronged as if he had been defeated before he even began. How come these outsiders, who were immortals in the mountains, could be so unrefined compared to their hometown people?!

Out of the entire bundle of charms, aside from the four previously drawn ones, the rest were all worthless blank sheets.

Pei Qian murmured, “Just as I thought. The mountain trade is no different from the marketplace in the capital of Nanyuan; they’re all the same.”

Pei Qian rubbed her face vigorously for a moment, finally sighing, “Fine, it’s decided. We’ll share this loss equally, and all thirty-five snowflake coins will be recorded under my account.”

Reopening the account book, although she began to write, Pei Qian kept turning her head to glare at Li Huai.

Li Huai cautiously asked, “Should we go to Xu Huan Fang and cause a scene?”

Pei Qian gritted her teeth, “They didn’t force us to buy anything; what’s the point of cursing?”

Pei Qian closed the account book, leaning back in her chair, swaying slightly, mumbling to herself, “There’s no such thing as free lunch.”

When Pei Qian mentioned lunch, Li Huai felt a pang of nostalgia as he missed his home-cooked pork and cabbage dumplings. Even those made with water celery and shepherd's purse, even without meat, were delicious.

Thinking about how, on this trip, even before reaching Northern Julu Continent, he had already incurred a significant debt of half a summer coin, Li Huai felt even more melancholic.

Pei Qian said, “Alright, that summer coin was practically dropped from the sky. These items don’t seem too bad; otherwise, I wouldn’t have let you buy them. The old rule applies; we’ll split it evenly.”

Among them were a celestial-grade green porcelain brush washer, a painting of a fox worshipping the moon, an old zitan stationery box inlaid with a pair of tri-colored lions, a paperweight resembling an ancient qin, a celestial inkstone depicting a drunken immortal holding the moon, and a green-glazed bowl adorned with dragon patterns.

To be honest, being able to buy so many “celestial artifacts” with just a summer coin on a cross-continental ferry wasn’t easy.

Pei Qian leaned over the table, examining the ancient qin paperweight, while Li Huai looked at the fox worshipping the moon painting. They both inadvertently locked eyes and then broke into smiles.

These items, which might not be particularly valuable, especially the bundle of charms that Pei Qian had tossed into the book box, were actually ones they both liked.

When they reached the Haikou Beach dock, before disembarking, Pei Qian took Li Huai to bid farewell to Manager Su and Shopkeeper Huang.

Shopkeeper Huang cheerfully presented a farewell gift, saying there was no need to refuse, as he was a long-time friend of her master and should accept it. However, Pei Qian firmly declined, saying she would send a small gift in the future once Xu Huan Fang opened for business at Horned Mountain, and then, with a bold face, would ask for a big red envelope from the old shopkeeper. Shopkeeper Huang was all smiles, agreeing to this.

Not only that, but Pei Qian also took out a gift prepared by her elder sister, which were exquisite bookmarks made from bamboo leaves of the green bamboo cultivated by Lord Wei of the Pi Ma Sect, each inscribed with poetry, either written by the white goose or the old chef. Pei Qian felt that combined, they didn’t even match her master’s handwriting, but it would suffice.

Fortunately, both elders accepted the gifts with smiles. After glancing over them, they looked back for a few more glances. Pei Qian had initially been worried they would accept them only to toss them aside once they turned away, but it seemed that wouldn’t happen.

Upon ascending the mountains and crossing rivers, they first paid respects to the immortals and offered incense. Though her master hadn’t instructed Pei Qian, after traveling alongside him through the vast martial world, she didn’t need teaching.

Thus, Pei Qian didn’t first head to the mural city but directly took Li Huai to Wooden Garment Mountain.

The host was still the wealth god of the Pi Ma Sect, Wei Yusong.

Zhu Quan happened to be on the mountain this time and came to meet the founding disciple of Chen Ping’an.

Just like before, he was carrying a bamboo box and holding a mountain staff. The earlier young boy named Chen Lingjun appeared somewhat sneaky and was not particularly likeable, but this slightly dark and thin girl was very pleasing to Zhu Quan’s eyes.

Whether a woman or a girl, it was rather unnecessary to be so beautiful.

This girl named Pei Qian was quite remarkable.

Zhu Quan inquired about Pei Qian and Li Huai’s travel route in detail.

According to the girl, it was quite similar to Chen Lingjun’s earlier journey, starting from Haikou Beach, heading southeast. Upon reaching Chunlu Garden at the estuary of the Great Lu, their paths would diverge drastically. While Chen Lingjun followed the river upstream, Pei Qian and Li Huai would head directly north and not go to the northernmost point, but rather make a left turn mid-journey. As for their journey to Chunlu Garden, they would not take the celestial ferry but instead walk.

However, they still intended to take a look around the scenic area near Wooden Garment Mountain and Haikou Beach.

Li Huai had no objections; besides, did it matter if he had any? Pei Qian was the helmsman, not him.

Pei Qian was already quite fluent in the formal language of Northern Julu Continent due to Zhu Mi Li’s influence. 

Compared to other continents, the formal language of Northern Julu Continent was widely spoken, making it much easier for outsiders to communicate. However, certain customs and practices in Northern Julu Continent were not very accommodating to outsiders.

Pei Qian was also quite proficient in the dialects of the small nations around Dumb Lake.

If she set her mind to learning, Pei Qian had always been quick on the uptake.

However, when following her master, she had to take things slower—copy books more slowly, walk more slowly, and grow up more slowly.

Zhu Quan seldom had the patience to listen to a young girl’s words.

Even during meetings at her own Patriarch Hall, she rarely displayed this much enthusiasm. Usually, she would sit cross-legged in a chair, resting her chin on one hand, yawning continuously, regardless of whether she was listening or not, nodding occasionally. The elders of the mountain, such as the strict ancestor Yan Su, the wealth god Wei Yusong, and Du Wensi among the members of the Patriarch Hall, were all used to this.

In recent years, after establishing a long-term trade route with Baoping Continent, Zhu Quan’s confidence soared. She finally realized that she was indeed a business genius. Thus, every time there were meetings, she would break away from her old habits, brimming with ambition, wanting to get involved in the specifics, only to be “suppressed” by Yan Su and Wei Yusong together. Especially Wei Yusong, who bluntly told her not to point fingers from the side and then sent her off to the Ghost Valley’s Qinglu Town.

Before descending the mountain, Zhu Quan insisted on giving Pei Qian a parting gift.

Just like at the ferry, Pei Qian still refused to accept it, having her own reasonable explanation.

When she was with her master, if her master hadn’t said anything, she would have accepted the gift. But when her master wasn’t around, Pei Qian felt it wouldn’t be appropriate to accept casually.

Zhu Quan then recognized Pei Qian as a goddaughter, not giving her a chance to refuse, and directly rode the wind down to Haikou Beach.

Leaving behind two people exchanging glances.

The two descended the mountain toward the mural city at the foot.

After the eight goddess portraits lost their blessings, only the lifeless, colorless sketches remained. Thus, the mural city became a gathering place for various burdens, increasingly chaotic.

Here, Pei Qian recalled a little anecdote her master had once recounted, about a woman who stubbornly bumped into him, only to not hit anyone and ended up breaking a “genuine Liuxia vase” worth three summer coins.

But this time, Pei Qian could not encounter that woman.

In fact, when she heard her master speak about these things, Pei Qian had always pretended to be foolish. Back then, she hadn’t had the courage to tell her master that she had done it herself as a child, and far more skillfully than that clumsy woman. But it couldn’t be done alone; she needed a partner. The larger one had to look well-dressed, clean, with a hint of a well-off family’s demeanor, while the smaller one, in the dead of winter, could just have bloodied hands from frostbite. 

When the item was broken, the larger one would grab a passerby and not let go, while the smaller one immediately squatted down, reaching to rummage around, smearing blood on their own face, and swiftly, they would start shrieking, as if they had lost both parents. This way, just by looking at them, people would be frightened.

They would then cry out that it was an ancestral item, something that was pawned for their mother’s medical bills, and while crying, they could bow their heads, and if they were clever, they could even bow down in the snow, where the blood would be less visible. 

One would just have to smear their face with the back of their hand, and the process would be effective. 

If it were not winter, then they would have to endure some hardship; Pei Qian, having endured hardship once, never agreed to do that job again and went elsewhere to make a living. The reasoning was simple: at that time, she simply couldn’t tolerate the pain from the shards cutting her hands. Besides, if it wasn’t winter there wouldn’t be snow, and bowing down wouldn’t hurt, would it?

There was a master who was in charge of that previous shady business. After Pei Qian ran away, he felt quite regretful. Later, when he encountered Pei Qian, he said she was indeed a good material. When she cried, it was quite genuine, almost like a funeral, with her large eyes, and when crying, her face was filled with false tears, mixed with blood from her frostbitten hands. 

That little face seemed to have only those big eyes left, enough to deceive people into feeling pity.

At that time, when hearing the praises from that guy, Pei Qian had only smiled and accepted, but inside, she was cursing, “What’s the use? Can it be eaten? You old hag, just give me a few copper coins!”

That old master, who had broken many of Pei Qian’s peers’ legs, was dead by the last time Pei Qian met him. 

In a shabby alley of the capital of Nanyuan, in the dead of winter, it was unknown whether he had been beaten to death or frozen to death; perhaps he had been half-killed and then frozen to death. Who could say? 

In any case, he didn’t have a single copper coin left on him, and Pei Qian secretly searched him before the patrol came to collect the corpses. She knew that.

She remembered cursing, “Even as a ghost, you’re still a poor ghost.”

Li Huai asked, “What are you thinking about?”

Pei Qian shook her head and smiled, “Thinking of nothing.”

She was just thinking about her master.

Thinking of the master who had brought the former Pei Qian to become the current Pei Qian.

(End of this chapter)

 ### Chapter 805: The Swordsman on Ruin Mountain

On a snowy night, entering the Wind and Snow Temple nestled among the mountains, the scenery was breathtaking.

As the night deepened and the snow fell heavily, the sounds of broken pine branches and snapped bamboo could be heard from time to time.

Throughout the journey, Wei Jin did not send a flying sword to notify the ancestral hall of the Wind and Snow Temple, nor was there any need to inform the divine platform, since Wei Jin was the sole inheritor of that lineage. The old residence on the mountain was merely symbolic, with a basic protective barrier to prevent collapse and keep outsiders from disturbing it. It was not designed to gather spiritual energy (Qi) or accumulate water.

Even when he entered the territory of the Wind and Snow Temple, Wei Jin had no intention of greeting his sect. He headed directly to the grave on the mountain. After paying his respects at the divine platform, he would leave immediately, having no desire to sit in the ancestral hall.

The Wind and Snow Temple boasted exquisite views, and the divine platform was even more renowned, famed across a continent for its stunning beauty. The mountains were dotted with ancient pines and giant cypress trees that had stood for a thousand years. Tonight, as snow blanketed the green peaks, several reclusive scholars lay beneath the pines, likely cultivators from another branch of the Wind and Snow Temple who had come to enjoy the snow and, unwilling to depart, began their practice right there. Upon encountering Wei Jin, the scholar clad in white, as pure as the snow, silently rose to pay his respects from afar.

Wei Jin pretended not to see.

It was Mi Yu, a visitor from afar, who smiled and waved goodbye to the scholar beneath the pines. The latter was puzzled by this exceptionally graceful young gentleman who could accompany Wei Jin into the mountains. One should know that Wei Jin despised any small talk during his visits to the graves; he preferred to be left alone, let alone bringing friends along to the divine platform.

Wei Jin was not fond of discussing the old matters of the Wind and Snow Temple. Luckily, Mi Yu had Wei Wenlong, who was always on the lookout for mountain and water news. This adept accountant from the Spring Banner Studio had a knack for digging up secret records. Nowadays, he understood the family trees of various clans on the mountains better than the official records of immortal masters from the Treasure Bottle Continent. Thus, Mi Yu learned that the Wind and Snow Temple was one of the ancestral homes of military practitioners on the Treasure Bottle Continent, which branched into six lineages. Later, the independent Ruan Qiong, who was now a fellow townsman of the Hidden Official, had once been part of the Green Water Pool lineage and left behind the long-distance sword furnace as a legacy, reflecting a typical amicable separation from the old sect. The Wind and Snow Temple could be considered half a family to the Dragon Spring Sword Sect, and Ruan Qiong was the leading swordsmith of the Treasure Bottle Continent. He had once clashed with the Water Talisman Dynasty's Da Mo Mountain Manor over sword forging, leading to the imprisonment of that mountain's sword immortal by the Wind and Snow Temple for fifty years; he was still a prisoner now.

Occasionally, Wei Wenlong would share gossip regarding the Wind and Snow Temple's Wenqing Peak and the many rumors surrounding the Daling Gorge, such as the ancestor of the Qin family from the Daling Gorge, who traveled the rivers with a certain elder from the Changchun Palace in their youth, a tale that always intrigued listeners. Sadly, they had never become immortal companions.

Unable to resist, Wei Jin casually asked, "Is that really true?"

Wei Wenlong had his reasons ready. He cited several historical accounts that verified such tales. Moreover, whenever the Changchun Palace held peak-opening or breakthrough ceremonies, the Wind and Snow Temple often sent direct disciples to congratulate them. Wasn't the ancestor of the Qin family always there in person?

Wei Jin had no words to counter this. He had never spoken to any of the so-called earth immortals from the Daling Gorge, so how could he have known any of this?

Even more strangely, Wei Wenlong pored over stacks of mountain and water news published decades or even centuries ago, without ever tiring, often taking notes and asserting which mountain peaks were merely posturing and which were genuinely thriving, yet preferred to keep a low profile while steadily accumulating wealth.

On the mountain, there were groups of young disciples from Wenqing Peak, tasked by their masters to come to the divine platform. Using secret techniques and magical items, they selected snowflakes to brew cold pastries and carved flowers, the former for entertaining guests and the latter as gifts. This snow selection was quite intricate, selecting ancient pine branches to place in bottles and jars, with different times yielding different snowflakes. For ordinary people, such things related to immortals felt like heavenly matters.

When these children saw Wei Jin, a figure of high standing in the Wind and Snow Temple, they did not dare greet him. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to; rather, they were too intimidated.

However, everyone’s faces lit up with joy upon seeing the famed Wei Sword Immortal return home.

Earlier, Wei Jin had dismissed the earth immortal beneath the pines as beneath his notice, yet when faced with these children from the Wind and Snow Temple, he would say similar words of caution, reminding them not to inform their elders, as the divine platform was perilous with its steep cliffs, and they should take care in their snow gathering.

As Wei Jin and his companions moved farther away, a snow-gathering boy jumped up, loudly exclaiming that the Wei Sword Immortal spoke to him. Soon, other children began arguing over who had been addressed by the ancestor. Their childish bickering mingled with the sound of the snowstorm.

Mi Yu turned to Wei Jin and asked with a smile, "The reputation of the Wind and Snow Temple has always been good, both in the mountains and outside. Why do you seem so disgruntled?"

Wei Jin had no intention of answering. In the world of immortal mountains, every family had its troubles. If one were to truly scrutinize, it might not involve absolute right or wrong, but to expect no grievances at all was unrealistic.

Mi Yu said, "Wenlong."

Wei Wenlong spoke in thought, "The news reported in the Treasure Bottle Continent is filled with nuances and rules. We dare not casually discuss the affairs of major mountains like the Wind and Snow Temple. The customs and people differ greatly from our Sword Qi Great Wall. Especially since the Wei Sword Immortal broke through too quickly and is the only seedling of the divine platform while the smiths of the Wind and Snow Temple prefer to wander and form groups. They could belong to different dynasties or factions than the martial practitioners of Zhenwu Mountain, which is why the reports only dare document the exploits of Wind and Snow Temple disciples during their adventures, and regarding the Wei Sword Immortal, it mostly only mentions his past connections with one of the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden from the Divine Scripture Sect..."

Wei Jin coughed.

Wei Wenlong immediately fell silent.

Upon reaching the grave, after lighting incense, Wei Jin took out three flasks of wine: one flask of bamboo sea cave wine from the Sword Qi Great Wall, one flask of Worry-Free wine from the Upside Down Mountain, and one flask of osmanthus brew from Old Dragon City.

Wei Jin squatted by the grave, murmuring softly, pouring the three flasks of wine before him.

Just as the group was about to leave the divine platform, a young sword wielder, looking like a teenager, arrived—he was the ancestor of the Wind and Snow Temple.

Wei Jin clasped his fists in greeting, and the ancestor did not try to persuade Wei Jin to stay in the mountains, only discussing matters related to Wei Jin's sect.

The ancestor of the Wind and Snow Temple eventually brought up an event from years ago—the sword cultivator dispute between Zhengyang Mountain and Fenglei Garden, held at the peak of the divine platform. At that time, they had not informed Wei Jin, who was out in the world, which was indeed a mistake on the part of the Wind and Snow Temple.

Wei Jin shook his head, stating that the divine platform ultimately belonged to the Wind and Snow Temple, and there was nothing improper about it; it was as it should be.

The two parted ways without lingering.

After the trio left the divine platform, the youthful ancestor of the Wind and Snow Temple took to the skies on his sword, landing on the branch of an ancient pine, sheathing his sword while gazing into the distance, seemingly troubled.

The ancestor of the Qin family from the Daling Gorge appeared beside him, softly asking, "Wei Jin returning to the mountain alive with an even stronger sword immortal aura is a great omen. Why does the ancestor seem unhappy?"

The boy raised his chin slightly. "Can you discern the depth of the two beside Wei Jin?"

The elder from the Daling Gorge replied, "That average-looking one is a Golden Core earth immortal, no doubt."

The boy nodded.

The elder continued, "But as for the one much better looking than Wei Jin, I'm afraid my eyes can't see through him."

The boy said, "Earlier, you were too far away. When I approached on my sword, the moment he displayed a hint of hostility, it was quite impressive, but he quickly concealed it, blending seamlessly. That makes him even more formidable."

The elder was puzzled. "The ancestor is a genuine sword immortal. Shouldn't you be cautious even on your own mountain?"

Anyone who associated with sword immortals was not to be underestimated.

The boy solemnly replied, "Regardless of whether he is some hidden expert or not, what truly concerns me is Wei Jin's reaction after that outsider displayed hostility. His indifference was normal, but you must understand, no matter how aloof Wei Jin appears regarding the Wind and Snow Temple, he is inherently a respectful disciple. But when that outsider revealed hostility toward the Wind and Snow Temple, don’t you find it strange how Wei Jin reacted?"

The elder cautiously asked, "Could it be that he is some sword... immortal from that side?"

The elder then gasped in astonishment. "Such a handsome sword immortal is hard to believe. It’s a wonder that Wei Jin, who has such connections, doesn’t introduce him to our Daling Gorge!"

The boy sighed, "Regardless, that fleeting hostility seems directed at my identity as a sword cultivator, not against the entire Wind and Snow Temple, which is enough. Just hear about this matter and leave it at that."

The elder nodded in agreement.

The boy smiled and said, "Little Qin, I’m no longer concerned about who that person is. I’m just worried that your big mouth will spill the beans everywhere. Today, you’re chatting amicably with a wandering sword immortal, and tomorrow, you might become sworn brothers, and the day after that, he might be your Daling Gorge's dragon-riding son-in-law."

The elder from the Daling Gorge displayed a disgruntled expression.

After leaving the Wind and Snow Temple, the heavy snowfall created a vast expanse of whiteness across the land.

The three did not deliberately elevate their figures but chose to ride the wind through the snow. Wei Jin wielded his sword, while Mi Yu, also a sword immortal, preferred a slower flight, claiming it was to take care of Wei Wenlong.

The world was vast, and immortals were few, with no one in sight on their journey.

Wei Wenlong chuckled, "We’re not too far from Ruin Mountain now."

Mi Yu grinned, "You’re the designated candidate for the Ruin Mountain ancestral hall appointed by the Hidden Official. I’m a bit concerned, so remember to cover for me later. Don’t act coldly just because I’m a mere offering after all those years of camaraderie."

Wei Wenlong wore a pained expression. "Mi Sword Immortal, you jest."

According to their plan, Wei Jin would escort Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong to Ruin Mountain, where Wei Wenlong would settle down, while Mi Yu was supposed to take a cross-continental ferry to the Taihui Sword Sect in the Northern Julu Continent. Given Mi Yu's cultivation level, as well as the ties between the Taihui Sword Sect and the Sword Qi Great Wall, alongside the young Hidden Official and the new sect leader Qi Jinglong, it was reasonable for Mi Yu to become a member of the ancestral hall there.

However, hearing that Wei Jin was heading to the Northern Julu Continent again, Mi Yu asked him to pass a message to the Taihui Sword Sect. He, Mi Yu, would shamelessly request an anonymous offering. If it posed any difficulty, he said not to force it; agreeing would be a kindness, while refusing would be the norm. Mi Yu truly felt he had no face to insist on the Taihui Sword Sect's approval. In his speech, there was no pretense of the "brocade pillow" Mi Yu's joking nature; he genuinely respected the Taihui Sword Sect.

Wei Jin was not one to affirm or deny others' life choices; Mi Yu was an authentic Jade Purity Realm cultivator. The so-called façade was merely in comparison to the elite sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall. Moreover, Mi Yu was no child, so since he insisted, Wei Jin agreed.

Wei Wenlong mentioned that the Ruin Mountain and the Cloud-Peeling Mountain each occupied half of the Niujiao Mountain ferry. Besides the cross-continental ferry from the Northern Julu Continent, there was also a merchant ferry, whose true ownership remained undisclosed. It was managed by Liu Chongrun, the former island master of Zhujing Lake, a girl of the fallen dynasty, where the royal treasury once possessed dragon boats and water palaces, surely making that ferry one of the dragon boats.

If the Wei Sword Immortal didn’t mind delaying their journey, the three could take this ferry to Niujiao Mountain. Wei Wenlong also hoped to observe the flow of passengers on the ferry and the loading and unloading activities at the docks.

Wei Jin had no objections, while Mi Yu was particularly enthusiastic, rubbing his hands together, excited, "We’re home! Finally, I’ve found a reliable place to settle down!"

At the southernmost dock of the ferry, located at the Huangni Bank in the northern-central part of the Treasure Bottle Continent, the name had no celestial connotation, and its origins were lost to history. The nearest neighboring ferry was named Village Makeup Ferry, which had a mountain inhabited mostly by female cultivators, Yuge Mountain, known for its beautiful female practitioners. Yuge Mountain had long renamed Village Makeup Ferry to Green Cloak Ferry, but all the cultivators on the mountain still referred to it as Village Makeup Ferry.

Thus, the outings of the female cultivators from Yuge Mountain to experience the world, compared to the disciples of the Unbeatable Divine Fist Gang, felt similarly resentful.

As they approached Huangni Bank, Wei Jin encountered a group of immortal masters who had longstanding ties with the Wind and Snow Temple. Ignoring them, one elder raised his voice, forcing Wei Jin to halt his sword. However, the Wei Sword Immortal simply dismissed them with a few words.

A lone sword immortal had no intentions of establishing a sect, so he had no need to consider worldly affairs.

Moreover, those immortal masters who almost faced rejection did not think poorly of Wei Jin after parting. In fact, they regarded his demeanor as befitting a sword immortal of the mountain peak. Being able to converse with the Wei Sword Immortal was something they could boast about to outsiders.

Naturally, Mi Yu would tease Wei Jin about his extensive connections, great reputation, and impressive demeanor, while also bringing up Shao Jianxian from the Spring Banner Studio for a little sunlight of his own.

As various mountain and water reports documented Wei Jin's return home, more and more people began to crowd around the Huangni Bank ferry, where Mi Yu and the others parted ways. Wei Jin would neither board the merchant ferry nor the cross-continental ferry to Pi Ma Sect, heading straight for the Northern Julu Continent, choosing to fly there on his sword.

Who could stop him from flying on his sword? What was there to discuss in terms of small talk?

As he boarded the merchant ferry, the young ladies serving on board were all quite young, perhaps with low cultivation, but they wore radiant smiles.

At that moment, Mi Yu felt very much at home.

The Hidden Official was certainly not deceiving him.

Wei Wenlong followed the usual practice, first purchasing mountain and water reports from the ferry, both old and new.

Outside the ferry, a flock of birds flew by, and soon after, a group of female cultivators from Yunxia Mountain, draped in colorful garments and riding various divine birds, accompanied the ferry for over a hundred miles.

Wei Wenlong was not unfamiliar with Yunxia Mountain, as he had recorded many entries regarding the transport of Yunge Stone from this mountain to Old Dragon City and then to Upside Down Mountain in the accounts of the Spring Banner Studio.

Wei Wenlong left the most ordinary cabin, which was quite similar to the one Mi Yu occupied, not luxurious but elegantly simple. The interior contained many decorative calligraphy and artifacts, indicating that the ferry had put in effort. Each detail reflected a delicate thoughtfulness, like a woman holding a silken fan half-covering her face, standing gracefully under a tree, not a noble lady, but a charming girl with her own unique style. Wei Wenlong arrived at the front of the ferry where passengers gathered, listening as they discussed the backgrounds and realms of the various ladies from Yunxia Mountain.

In the distance, Wei Wenlong saw Mi Yu leaning against the railing, joyfully chatting with a young woman who was not a ferry maiden but a qi practitioner. When they spoke, they looked quite intimate, making it seem like they were fellow adventurers in the world of immortals. The woman, who was also charmingly beautiful, when in high spirits with Mi Yu, reached out to lightly pat him, but her eyes did not seem to enjoy looking at anyone else. Whenever someone passed by, she would sneak a glance, focusing precisely on their robes, jade belts, and jeweled hairpins, her discerning gaze quite practiced. The reason her eyes seemed to only have Mi Yu in them was likely that she had already scrutinized him from head to toe, estimating him to be a certain wealthy family's immortal master worth befriending.

If the young Hidden Official were here, he would probably say something like "A dog can’t change its nature," and scold both of them.

However, Wei Wenlong soon realized that the young Hidden Official was very tolerant of the world and its affairs.

What puzzled Wei Wenlong was Mi Yu. Although Mi Yu had high standards when it came to women, he could engage with all sorts of them, all the while appearing sincere, as if all the flirtatious exchanges were discussions about the Great Dao of cultivation.

Mi Yu spotted Wei Wenlong, pointed at him, and said to the woman, "Sister Jiao Lan, I previously told you about the charming, well-connected, and wealthy young master Wei, see him over there? Look, this time I’m traveling far and relying on him for all expenses. Don’t be fooled by his youth; he’s an old immortal at the Cave Mansion level. I plan to help Young Master Wei with his chores first, hoping to earn myself an identity in the family trees later."

The young woman followed Mi Yu’s finger to see the rather dull-looking Wei Wenlong. She smiled and nodded, agreeing a few times, but afterward, her tone became less enthusiastic, and she quickly found an excuse to leave.

No matter how handsome a man was, he couldn’t outshine the fact that he was just a mediocre visitor from a minor sect.

Wei Wenlong watched Mi Yu wave him over, leaving the crowd to join him.

Mi Yu leaned against the railing and waved energetically at a female cultivator from Yunxia Mountain riding a white phoenix. She covered her mouth and giggled, whispering with her companion, and soon more female cultivators turned their gazes toward the merchant ferry.

Wei Wenlong thought in his heart, "Mi Sword Immortal, remember to use an alias."

He, Wei Wenlong, was relatively unknown, aside from within the Spring Banner Studio and did not have much of a reputation at Upside Down Mountain, so this was unnecessary. However, Mi Yu, being a sword immortal with a far greater reputation than his actual strength, still needed to be cautious.

Mi Yu removed the sword-breeding gourd "Haoliang," sipping the osmanthus brew, and said, "Do you really think I’m an idiot?"

Wei Wenlong apologized, "I spoke out of turn."

Mi Yu laughed, "What’s there to apologize for? You think I’m an idiot? I’m not even angry; how could I blame you for being kind?"

Mi Yu patted Wei Wenlong's shoulder. "Wenlong, from now on, don’t be so restrained around me. It’s unnecessary; that’d just make things awkward."

Wei Wenlong grew more restrained.

Mi Yu leaned back against the railing and said in thought, "Wenlong, you earned the recognition from the Hidden Official, as well as from Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan, through your true abilities in the Spring Banner Studio. So you must not look down on yourself. If you do, then what should I, Mi Yu, do?"

Wei Wenlong was a bit at a loss.

Mi Yu didn’t press him. "Forget it; just do what you feel comfortable doing."

Wei Wenlong curiously asked, "Mi Sword Immortal, why does it seem like the Hidden Official and Ruin Mountain have little reputation on this journey north? Especially the Hidden Official; even among the young talents selected from the Northern Julu and Treasure Bottle Continents, he’s not on the list. Moreover, at every immortal ferry, whenever people mention the Hidden Official's hometown, it's mostly about the night banquet hosted by Wei Mountain Lord at the Northern Cloud Mountain. Why does it seem like the Treasure Bottle Continent has never heard of someone like the Hidden Official?"

As he spoke, Wei Wenlong grew increasingly confused. "Even if the Hidden Official is still in his early thirties, he was already in his twenties when he last visited us. With his abilities, how could the mountains of the Treasure Bottle Continent not know of him? If I remember correctly, after the Hidden Official arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he passed three trials and defeated the talented Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji. This level of strength should be comparable to that of the Wei Sword Immortal back in the day, right?"

Mi Yu replied, "He doesn’t want to be known, so he isn’t."

"If he wants to be known, then he can’t help but be known."

Wei Wenlong agreed deeply. He had heard of Lin Junbi's return home to the Central Divine Continent and the acclaim that followed. Via the cross-continental ferry, the praises reached all corners, from Confucian academies to the sects in the Central Divine Continent and even the royal courts of the Shao Yuan Dynasty. Lin Junbi was truly in the spotlight.

However, Mi Yu added, "The real reason is that he feels that once he’s at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he’s away from home and can truly act without reservations."

Wei Wenlong whispered, "A dormant dragon in the abyss."

One day, even a lion would use all its strength to catch a rabbit.

Mi Yu said, "Wenlong, with your talent, once you reach Ruin Mountain, I guarantee you will thrive!"

Wei Wenlong asked, "Mi Sword Immortal, why do you say that?"

Mi Yu laughed, "The Hidden Official often says to treat others with sincerity."

Wei Wenlong nodded. "That makes sense."

Mi Yu turned to look at Wei Wenlong. "Wenlong, your lack of romantic luck isn’t without reason. You don’t even have a fraction of the Hidden Official’s skills."

Wei Wenlong felt ashamed. "That’s obvious. The Hidden Official is upright and understanding, always empathetic and considerate in dealings with others, which is why many women are attracted to him."

Mi Yu laughed and scolded, "Damn it, you’ve got your own divine powers. Where in life isn’t there a Ruin Mountain?"

Wei Wenlong, the future Lord of Ruin Mountain, was utterly confused.

After the dragon boat ferry docked at Niujiao Mountain, Mi Yu found Liu Chongrun and said in the refined language of the Treasure Bottle Continent, "Manager Liu, my true name is unremarkable; my nickname in the martial world is ‘No More Rice.’ Manager Liu, I will soon become an immortal master in Ruin Mountain’s family tree, so let’s keep in touch."

Liu Chongrun didn’t understand why this person was saying such nonsensical things, so he perfunctorily exchanged a few polite words before boarding the ship. In business dealings, one should not turn away a smiling face.

If this person were to go to Ruin Mountain to burn incense and bow to the ancestral hall, that could be discussed later; courtesy did not need to be rushed. Yet Liu Chongrun felt that the man before him was far too handsome. In the future, his own branch would be filled with younger, inexperienced girls; he would have to be cautious. He hoped that no trouble would arise due to this man’s nonsensical words, leading to a group of disciples who should be diligently cultivating to become infatuated with an outsider or bicker like jealous wives.

Wei Wenlong stood by, deep in thought. Mi Yu seemed quite distant from the ferry maidens, making no attempts to flirt, even when approached by one of them. He maintained a respectful distance.

Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong conformed to local customs, walking to Ruin Mountain.

Taking a detour through the main entrance, as they passed the foot of the cliff, Mi Yu paused, grinning with interest.

Wei Wenlong noticed the large patches of ground with signs of filled-in pits and looked up, asking, "Mi Sword Immortal, were a few pure warriors jumping off the cliff for fun? They should be at the Golden Body Realm, right?"

Mi Yu shook his head. "It’s the same person, and they haven’t reached the Golden Body Realm yet."

Wei Wenlong also shook his head. "The depths vary greatly; it shouldn’t be the same person. If it were, over time, the pits wouldn’t be so obvious. It’s unlikely someone could break through in such a short time. Even the Hidden Official couldn’t manage that."

Mi Yu asked, "Shall we make a bet?"

Wei Wenlong vigorously shook his head. "No betting; those who deal with accounts must avoid gambling. I cannot let down the Hidden Official and my master’s trust. From now on, on this mountain, I must adhere to all matters, big and small."

Mi Yu didn’t mind. 

As for why Wei Wenlong thought otherwise, it was simple: his cultivation was not high enough.

Mi Yu’s Jade Purity Realm was genuine; he was not a fake.

Upon arriving at the main gate of Ruin Mountain, Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong exchanged glances.

The one guarding the gate was a young lad. Upon hearing that the two were friends of the mountain master, he noted down "Wei Wenlong" and "No More Rice" and let them through.

Just as Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong had taken a few steps up the stairs, they noticed a small fellow, about the height of a finger, rushing up the steps, sighing loudly, not slowing down at all.

Wei Wenlong explained softly, "This is a little incense person from the world of righteousness. Not every wealthy family or mountain temple has one, so they are quite rare."

The little fellow struggled to climb the steps repeatedly, as though he were traversing mountains.

However, there was no way around it; since the master was not at the mountain, the rules remained, so every time he came to visit Ruin Mountain, he could only obediently enter through the main gate.

As he passed by the two guests, he didn’t look up until he had climbed about ten steps higher. Then he turned around, hands on his hips, and said, "Do you know who I am?"

Feeling he might have been rude, he quickly lowered his hands and performed a bow, introducing himself as the incense master of the Longzhou City Hall, the second in command, also the right protector of the Dragon Riding Alley, unsure of which seat he was on but he had a seat to sit on. Today he was here to report for duty.

The little incense person solemnly repeated his previous question.

Wei Wenlong didn’t know how to respond. He thought the little fellow seemed quite clever; could this be the so-called jargon for paying respects to the mountain?

Mi Yu stepped up a few steps, squatted down, and with a smile said, "I’ve heard of you. How could I not know? I’m the assistant to the mountain master of Ruin Mountain. I’ve heard he speaks highly of the right protector of Dragon Riding Alley, diligent and competent."

The little incense person was taken aback and enviously exclaimed, "You actually know our mountain master?! I haven’t even met him! I’m on good terms with the previous and current right protectors of Dragon Riding Alley, and I’ve asked Lady Pei if I could greet the mountain master if I ever meet him. She said I must report my attendance a hundred times at the gate before I could even think about it."

The little fellow rattled off a series of titles without taking a breath.

Mi Yu smiled brightly, thinking, this is indeed the unique style of Ruin Mountain. Why would I go to the Northern Julu Continent?

Then, a girl descended from the mountain after practicing her punches. She saw the two but did not greet them, simply focusing on her practice as she walked toward the mountain gate.

Wei Wenlong felt that Ruin Mountain was filled with hidden mysteries. It truly deserved to be the cultivation place of the Hidden Official.

Those large pits left by people jumping off the cliff, the boy flipping through books at the gate, and the focused girl practicing her punches...

Mi Yu extended his hand, saying, "Let me give you a ride on my shoulders."

The little incense person shook his head. "No, that wouldn’t be sincere; it might get me recorded by Lady Pei. Lady Mi Li is very strict."

The little fellow continued climbing the mountain.

Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong slowly ascended the mountain when two young girls came running down, one in a pink skirt and the other in black, the latter carrying a small golden burden.

Wei Wenlong was somewhat impressed.

Chen Nuanshu led Zhou Mi Li as they ran down the steps, stopping on the same step as Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong. Then, Chen Nuanshu bowed and said, "Welcome, esteemed guests. Earlier, when Wei Sword Immortal passed by, he mentioned that the mountain master had prepared accommodations for you."

Wei Ban appeared beside them, smiling with thought. "Nuanshu, Mi Li, don’t worry about it; I’ll take care of the guests."

The two young girls were not shy with Wei Mountain Lord and took their leave.

Wei Ban said, "Wei Sword Immortal only mentioned that two esteemed guests would be arriving and did not elaborate on their identities. May I inquire who you are?"

Mi Yu smiled, "Sword Qi Great Wall, Mi Yu. I am a direct disciple of Shao Yunyan from Upside Down Mountain, and this is Wei Wenlong. According to the Hidden Official’s instructions, we can become part of the family tree of Ruin Mountain at any time."

As for Wei Ban, the young Hidden Official did not speak much, but his words carried considerable weight. "You can feel free to confide in me."

Thus, Wei Wenlong followed closely behind and produced a letter considered a family missive to hand to this mountain lord of the Northern Peak of the Treasure Bottle Continent.

After opening the letter, Wei Ban read the flowing script, then placed it back in the envelope, his expression strange. After a moment’s hesitation, he smiled and said, "Mi Sword Immortal, Chen Pingan mentions in the letter that you are very likely to stay stubbornly at Ruin Mountain..."

Mi Yu sensed something was amiss and was about to fabricate some nonsense when he thought that if all else failed, he would just throw a tantrum.

Wei Ban continued, "The letter states that if you wish to stay, feel free to do so. You can first be a named offering not disclosed externally, which would be a bit of a burden for you, Mi Sword Immortal."

Mi Yu let out a sigh of relief, smiling, "I have a good affinity with Mountain Lord Wei; arriving at the mountain is already wonderful news."

Wei Ban nodded with a smile, though internally he was astounded. Chen Pingan’s description of Mi Yu was simple: a sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall, at the Jade Purity Realm bottleneck, trustworthy.

A sword immortal at the Jade Purity Realm bottleneck.

Wei Ban turned to Wei Wenlong and smiled, "Wei Wenlong, from this day forth, you will be the one managing finances at Ruin Mountain. Nuanshu will hand over all the accounts to you."

At this point, Wei Ban paused slightly and said, "I have a small request: even after the handover, I hope you won’t stop Nuanshu from reviewing the accounts. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but Nuanshu has always managed the finances of Ruin Mountain without a hitch, and since the business has grown larger, it’s indeed necessary to have someone specifically handling finances. After all, Nuanshu’s responsibilities are heavy, and both Zhu Lian and I wouldn’t want her to overwork herself. Of course, this matter isn’t mentioned in Chen Pingan’s letter. If you feel any resentment because of this, then that would mean Chen Pingan misjudged you, and when you return to Ruin Mountain, he should bear the blame."

Wei Ban concluded, "We are all family now, so I won’t speak too formally."

Wei Wenlong smiled and said, "The matter of managing accounts must prioritize clarity; there’s no need for one person to monopolize the accounts in secret. There’s no reason for Mountain Lord Wei to overthink."

Wei Ban smiled knowingly and nodded, "You truly are someone Chen Pingan holds in high regard. Without a doubt, the ability to earn and manage money is exceptional. To earn his genuine admiration, one cannot be lacking."

Wei Wenlong cupped his fists and nodded.

From that day on, Mi Yu and Wei Wenlong were considered rooted in Ruin Mountain.

Wei Wenlong’s residence became the accounting office of Ruin Mountain.

After handing over all the accounts, Chen Nuanshu no longer dealt with financial matters. Whenever funds were needed, she would ask Mr. Wei for approval, bringing along a sheet detailing every expenditure's origins and destinations. Moreover, she seemed worried that frequent visits would delay Mr. Wei’s significant matters, so she often would cover some trivial expenses with herself and Zhou Mi Li, compiling them into one sheet to settle accounts with Mr. Wei.

Wei Wenlong did not find this tedious but felt somewhat embarrassed. Although he hadn’t been on the mountain for long, he could see how busy Chen Nuanshu was, indeed having things to do from dawn till dusk. Wei Wenlong thus took the initiative to ask the little girl if she liked keeping accounts, to which the girl in the pink skirt nodded shyly.

Wei Wenlong divided the accounts of Ruin Mountain into two parts: the large financial dealings, including the Niujiao Mountain ferry and the merchant ferry, would be his responsibility, while the daily accounts of Ruin Mountain would remain with her. However, all major business transactions, the little girl could learn, and if she didn’t understand, she should just ask.

Wei Wenlong had indeed become the accountant of Ruin Mountain.

As for Mi Yu, he spent his days wandering, followed by the little girl carrying the burden.

Mi Yu didn’t feel the days on the mountain were dull; they were quite amusing, especially with Zhou Mi Li by his side, never a moment of boredom.

Today, Mi Yu accompanied Zhou Mi Li by the stone table at the cliff, munching on seeds while listening to her tales of wandering through the martial world, a sword immortal entranced.

The little incense person returned to the mountain to report for duty, bustling about, tidying up the seed shells on the stone table.

The grand steward of Ruin Mountain, Zhu Lian, was said to be away on a journey.

Mi Yu understood why, as he had seen through the talisman puppet resembling Zhu Lian long ago.

Today, Zhou Mi Li’s tales traveled from the Red Candle Town to the Chongdan River, the Yuye River, and the Xiu Hua River, detailing which rivers had great spots. She finally told "Elder Yu Mi" that he must visit the Chongdan River and the Xiu Hua River. The offerings there were a bit pricey, but one could purchase them from the nearby Tie Fu River’s Water God Temple for a better deal. After all, it was just boiling fragrant water, and there were no taboos; both Water Gods were quite amiable. Mi Yu chuckled and asked why there was no mention of the Yuye River, causing the little girl to scrunch her brows in confusion, saying, "I told you about it before; didn’t I? Elder Yu Mi, you must have forgotten! My head is famously clever; that’s impossible!" When the little girl saw Elder Yu Mi smiling without speaking, she hurriedly waved her hands, saying that there was no rush to visit any of the three rivers. Once Pei Qian and Chen Lingjun returned home from their adventures, they could all go together.

The little incense person had held back for a long time and murmured, "What’s the point of that Yuye River? That wicked woman nearly..."

Zhou Mi Li became anxious, slapping her hand down, covering the little fellow, then leaning over the table, lifting her palm slightly, looking at the little incense person. She frowned and lowered her voice, reminding, "No speaking ill behind backs."

Then the little girl laughed heartily, covering her mouth, mumbling, "Elder Yu Mi, tomorrow I’ll check the almanac. If it’s a good day to go out, I’ll take you to play at the nearby Huimeng Mountain. I’m very familiar with it!"

Mi Yu smiled and accepted it, remembering the Yuye River.

Turning around, he noticed an unexpected guest.

Not entirely unfamiliar, but not well-acquainted either.

It was said this person was currently shamelessly practicing at the Bai Jian Platform?

What Golden Core and Nascent Soul sword cultivators—unless they were beautiful women, Mi Yu couldn’t be bothered to pay any attention.

After all, what Mi Yu was criticized for was not his swordsmanship among sword immortals but for being the squandering, unambitious brother of Mi Hu, not for his accomplishments in slaying monsters. In truth, before reaching the upper five realms, whether he was battling on the city walls or out of the city, he had been following the paths of Nalan Caihuan and Qi Shou, truly worthy pioneers.

Yet, a Golden Core sword cultivator named Cui Wei had long fled to the world of righteousness; what qualifications did he have to earn a glance from Mi Yu?

Therefore, before Cui Wei could speak, Mi Yu said, "Keep your distance."

Zhou Mi Li, a bit flustered, whispered, "Elder Yu Mi, don’t be like that. Senior Cui is one of our own; he’s very good."

Mi Yu smiled and nodded, then turned to the silent Cui Wei and said, "Then please, roll far away."

Zhou Mi Li crossed her arms, slightly angry. At Ruin Mountain, such speech wasn’t allowed.

Mi Yu had no choice but to raise his hands in surrender, smiling, "Alright, alright, Senior Cui, please sit down and enjoy some seeds."

Cui Wei silently sat down, asking in thought, "Mi Sword Immortal, how is my master?"

Mi Yu replied, "You have the face to ask, but I have no face to answer."

Cui Wei nodded and stood up, leaving in disappointment.

Mi Yu rose, taking down the Haoliang sword-breeding gourd from his waist, standing at the cliff's edge, drinking slowly.

Should he take advantage of the fact that he wasn’t yet a legitimate family tree immortal master of Ruin Mountain to eliminate a few troublesome Jade Purity Realm individuals?

Not to mention the power of a full strike; as for stealth and executing a flying sword attack, Mi Yu was actually quite skilled. Although he wouldn’t compare to the Hidden Official and that Wei Jiang, he considered himself no less capable than the average sword immortal.

Mi Yu looked down with a smile, realizing it was Zhou Mi Li tugging at his sleeve. She tiptoed and pulled out a handful of seeds, raising them high.

Mi Yu squatted down, accepting the seeds with a gentle laugh. "Little Mi Li, many people from my hometown have heard the story of the dumb lake monster in the Lake of Silence. Among those 'many people,' many are no longer around, which is quite unfortunate. And that Senior Cui, even I am not as good as him, so I’m quite angry with him."

Zhou Mi Li wrinkled her brows and nodded vigorously, indicating she absolutely understood.

Finally, the little girl accompanied the sword immortal known as "Yu Mi," sitting beside the cliff. She thought his name was wonderful, as both had the character for "rice," a fateful connection.

Thus, Zhou Mi Li offered all her seeds to Mi Yu, her little head bobbing, smiling, "I’ll tell you a little secret. I’ve been waiting for the good person to return! For instance, I’d squat by the mountain gate, claiming to watch Cen Yuanji practice punches; or I’d stand at the railing on the mountain peak, saying I’m chatting with the mountain god; and now I’m sitting here, claiming to see the cloud sea birds passing by my door. So, Pei Qian and Sister Nuanshu still don’t know about this!"

Mi Yu responded, "I see, if you hadn’t said so, I wouldn’t have known."

The little girl wore a worry the size of a grain of rice. "Why hasn’t he come home yet? No matter how good your hometown is, it isn’t his hometown."

Mi Yu said, "Indeed, who knows?" 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 806: A Difficult Reunion in the Jianghu (Part 1)**

Wei Ban invited Mi Yu to be a guest at the grand residence of the Mountain Lord atop Piyun Mountain. It was indeed a place of great feng shui, a veritable divine cave, sprawling like a garden, without any practitioners of the Dao or mundane folk. The snow weighed down the pine branches as they pounced upon deer, while the waters of Xian Mountain sparkled with allure.

Eventually, Wei Ban led Mi Yu to a high platform obscured by an illusionary spell, named Yingran. Wei Ban often enjoyed sitting here alone, drinking wine and admiring the scenery, with vistas stretching in all directions.

On Yingran Platform, there were only a few snow-white meditation mats, nothing more. As the moon began to rise, the colors of snow and moonlight competed for brilliance. Beyond the mountains, in different directions, faint lights could be seen from Longzhou City, Huaihuang County, and Hongzhu Town, like three lanterns of varying sizes placed upon the snowy ground, urging even the divine beings residing in the mountain estate to hold their breath, lest they extinguish the lights under the moon.

Mi Yu took out the Hu Liang Sword-raising Calabash, which he had yet to give away, took a sip of wine, looked around at the night scenery, and sighed, “It truly is a wonderful place, blessed by both talent and the land. Thanks to Wei Wenlong, I learned on my way here that many contemporaries of Lord Hidden Official from Lihuzhu Cave have excelled after stepping out. There’s Ma Kuxuan from Zhenwu Mountain, Gu Can from Shujian Lake, and Song Mu from the Dali Prefecture. As for Liu Xianyang, I’ve met him several times at the Sword Qi Great Wall; he’s quite remarkable. His life-bound flying sword is rare even at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Wei Ban chuckled self-deprecatingly, “Good land and water, of course. After all, not all mountain spirits can continuously host so many night excursions. Within the realm of Northern Mountain, the sound of pots and pans clanging is endless; one must have a pot of iron at home, right?”

Mi Yu burst into a hearty laugh. This Northern Mountain Lord, who held high status on Baoping Continent, was far more amusing than he had imagined. It’s good; if he were a rigid and stuffy mountain spirit, it would have severely dampened the mood.

After taking a large gulp of wine, Mi Yu composed himself and said, “Lord Hidden Official once mentioned that if it weren’t for Lord Wei’s protection, Lou Po Mountain wouldn’t have what it has today. Otherwise, we couldn’t grab hold of it, and it would only bring misfortune.”

Wei Ban replied, “Similarly, if it weren’t for Chen Pingan, I, Wei Ban, could not have become the Mountain Lord of Daya. Lou Po Mountain needed to leverage Piyun Mountain, just as Piyun Mountain needed to leverage Lou Po Mountain—one is in the light, the other in the dark.”

One could trust wholeheartedly, so the subsequent conversation between the two was very candid.

Wei Ban and the sword immortal discussed the immediate concerns and long-term considerations of Lou Po Mountain, while Mi Yu spoke of the situation at the Sword Qi Great Wall. As for matters concerning Lord Hidden Official, Mi Yu said little.

After some deliberation, Wei Ban shared some insider information that shouldn’t be discussed openly but could be spoken of privately with Mi Yu.

In the end, Mi Yu felt somewhat helpless. “It’s a tangled mess; dealing with it seems far beyond just chopping someone down with a sword or two?”

Wei Ban shook his head. “Since Chen Pingan is destined to be unable to return home anytime soon, then Lou Po Mountain’s reception of guests will also change. Merely hiding away isn’t a strategy. As for whether to draw the sword, when to draw it, and against whom, it all depends on Zhu Lian’s judgment.”

Mi Yu nodded. “Lord Hidden Official holds Zhu Lian in high regard. I’ll follow his instructions.”

Regarding Zhu Lian, Mi Yu had not seen him in person but had heard much about him.

Unable to resist, Wei Ban asked, “Mi Sword Immortal, may I ask why you hold Chen Pingan in such high regard?”

Mi Yu corrected him, “It’s respect, not just regard. I’m a lazy person who doesn’t like to think; I’ve always been fearful of dealing with those who are exceptionally smart. To be honest, in this vast world of Haoran, I’d rather be enemies with a continent’s practitioners than with Lord Hidden Official.”

Since Mi Yu was reserved, Wei Ban felt it inappropriate to inquire about Chen Pingan's specific deeds and various circumstances at the Sword Qi Great Wall. The fact that a sword immortal at the bottleneck of the Yu Pu realm referred to Chen Pingan as “Lord Hidden Official” spoke volumes.

Wei Ban sighed, “I knew Chen Pingan would grow, but I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.”

Mi Yu didn’t want to delve into this topic and asked, “Why do you need to knock on the railing when drinking?”

Wei Ban smiled, “When no one responds, one finds joy in oneself.”

Mi Yu nodded. “Indeed, Lord Wei, like Lord Hidden Official, is well-read.”

A year of good nights, the moon shines bright for thousands of miles.

Wei Ban said, “Mi Sword Immortal, I have a request. If you agree, it may consume roughly a year and a half of your time. As for things at Lou Po Mountain, I will keep an eye on them.”

Mi Yu replied, “Feel free to speak.”

Wei Ban explained, “Soon, a group of celestial teachers from Changchun Palace will travel south and will pass through Hongzhu Town. Among the five, the one with the highest realm is only at the Dragon Gate realm. However, in the central region of Baoping Continent, there are still many exiled practitioners harboring animosity towards Dali. Changchun Palace has been particularly generous during the recent night excursions; I want to return the favor. They will be traveling quite a distance, and since they need to leave the Northern Mountain territory, it’s better to owe a favor to you, Mi Sword Immortal, rather than to the Central Mountain Lord Jin Qing. Thus, I hope for your assistance.”

Mi Yu joked, “I’m just getting acquainted with the customs of Baoping Continent. Previously, while accompanying Wei Jin north, there was nothing but flattery everywhere, making it hard to just enjoy a quiet drink.”

Wei Ban explained the general situation of this "escort mission" and then handed Mi Yu a document he had prepared in advance. Upon opening it, Mi Yu saw the name Yu Mi, a person from Longquan County in Dali. Mi Yu smiled knowingly; “Yu Mi, a great name.”

In addition, Wei Ban gave Mi Yu a branch with a few vibrant green leaves. “This is a branch of the Lianli tree. If there’s an urgent matter that even I cannot handle, I will burn the other half. Then the Lianli branch in your hand will wilt, and upon returning to the Northern Mountain territory, if I burn the branch again, I can immediately appear to escort you back to Lou Po Mountain.”

Mi Yu tucked the branch into his sleeve.

Wei Ban hesitated, wanting to say something but holding back.

Mi Yu laughed heartily, “Rest assured, I, Mi Yu, will never indulge in any romantic entanglements.”

After all, Wei Jin once mentioned that Changchun Palace was a sect where many female cultivators gathered, while Lou Po Mountain had long established a secret vault of records. Although Changchun Palace had fewer secret records compared to Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City, Mi Yu was still diligent in reviewing them. After Wei Wenlong entered Lou Po Mountain and brought with him a parting gift from his teacher, the sword immortal Shao Yunyan, which contained various historical documents about the countries of Baoping Continent, the number of records in Lou Po Mountain’s vault doubled overnight.

Wei Ban helplessly remarked, “Chen Pingan said in his letter that I need not worry about Mi Yu’s character, but to only worry about Mi Yu’s face.”

Mi Yu sighed, “Only Lord Hidden Official understands me. I’m not a bad person, but this face of mine tends to get me into trouble.”

At this point, Mi Yu laughed loudly, “Brother Wei, I’m not insulting anyone.”

The Mountain Lord next to him was indeed a handsome man.

Wei Ban thought of someone and restrained his laughter, unwilling to continue that line of conversation. He then said, “If Mi Sword Immortal doesn’t find it troublesome, Lou Po Mountain has a few masks carefully crafted by Zhu Lian for you to choose from.”

Mi Yu was indeed a genuine sword immortal, especially coming from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Regardless of his relationship with Chen Pingan or how well he integrated with Lou Po Mountain, Wei Ban was willing and needed to treat him with courtesy.

Mi Yu nodded, “A small matter.”

The following day, five cultivators from Changchun Palace arrived at the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry aboard a cross-continent boat from Pima Sect. Among them was a young female cultivator from Hongzhu Town, with delicate features. Her nickname was Yishan, while her real name was Yizhan. Due to her lowly birth, she had abandoned her surname, and in the genealogy of Changchun Palace, she was renamed Zhongnan. It was rumored that once she ascended to the Golden Core realm, the Dali Empress would personally grant her the national surname “Song.”

She was currently at the Cave Dwelling realm, not a high cultivation level, but she was the highest-ranking among the group because her mentor was a Supreme Elder of Changchun Palace, which had once been a refuge for the Dali Empress during the summer months. Thus, while Changchun Palace was not a major celestial sect, it still held considerable influence in the Dali Dynasty.

The leading female cultivator of the group, who was at the Ocean-Seeking realm, still needed to address her as “Shi Gu” (aura of a teacher), while the other three female cultivators were much younger, with a significant disparity in rank compared to Zhongnan.

At the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry, there used to be a series of celestial buildings crafted by the Baofu Sect, which were later transferred to Piyun Mountain and Lou Po Mountain. Changchun Palace acquired two shops to sell unique celestial items, similar to the Caique Mansion in the Northern Julu Continent, mostly suitable for female cultivators’ robes and accessories.

The shopkeeper was a middle-aged woman who personally welcomed her junior sister Zhongnan, standing beside her was a graceful middle-aged man, who exuded an impressive demeanor and wore a friendly smile.

The shopkeeper cheerfully introduced, “This Yu Mi is one of the registered guest officials of Piyun Mountain. His family elder has ties with Lord Wei.” 

The woman then whispered to her companions, “Yu Mi has only cultivated for sixty years, yet he is already at the Ocean-Seeking realm, making him akin to a sword master, skilled in sword charms, and thus quite formidable. Moreover, Yu Mi fortuitously met Wei Sword Immortal in the Jianghu during his early years and shared a table for drinks. Although their relationship is not particularly close, it remains sufficient for a few words of assistance when they reach Fengxue Temple.”

Given that he was a guest official of Piyun Mountain, though he was an unnamed low-tier guest official, belonging to the category of loose cultivators who had never participated in a night excursion, there were only a few guest officials at Piyun Mountain currently. The lower his cultivation level, the more it demonstrated the depth of his family’s connection to Mountain Lord Wei.

Yu Mi, having met Wei Sword Immortal and possessing a profound familial relationship with Piyun Mountain, was thus qualified to discuss matters of protection while traveling.

The elderly woman, who was at the Dragon Gate realm, readily agreed but, to be cautious, she instructed the shopkeeper to send a message to Changchun Palace via flying sword, elaborating on this matter, emphasizing that it was indeed unusual for her junior sister Zhongnan to be so special in Changchun Palace. If the resident elder of Changchun Palace deemed Yu Mi unsuitable for traveling together, the arrangement would have to be canceled midway. Even if it inadvertently complicated relations, they could not afford to covet the petty favor of a mere Ocean-Seeking outsider.

Thinking of this, the old woman felt somewhat helpless. Currently, all the local deities of Changchun Palace had quietly left the mountain peak, seemingly burdened with important tasks. Yet, none of these local deities, whether they were elders or guest officials, had disclosed a single word regarding their whereabouts, nor their purposes—everything was a secret. Thus, during Zhongnan’s first journey down the mountain, it was only this Dragon Gate elder who could serve as a protector. Otherwise, at least a Golden Core earth deity should have taken the lead. If they wished not to let their disciples become complacent, they should ideally have someone to escort them in secret.

After some conversation, Yu Mi began following the group southward towards Hongzhu Town. The sword charms forged by the Longquan Sword Sect could allow Qi practitioners to soar over the winds in Longzhou, yet they were rare and expensive. The female cultivators from Changchun Palace had only one precious sword charm owned by Zhongnan, a gift from her mentor, thus they could only proceed on foot.

They could visit the Iron Symbol River God Temple, the birthplace of Wei Mountain Lord in Qidun Mountain, and since practitioners of the Dao considered this journey trivial, it was not particularly arduous.

Due to the excellent land and water, even in the cold winter, the banks remained sunny and warm, with mixed trees blooming, creating a pleasant scene. 

Thus, crowds of visitors flocked to the river god temple to light incense and pray for blessings, with common folk and wealthy families alike. Moreover, since Longzhou had become a popular tourist destination, especially with Piyun Mountain hosting several night excursions, over the past decade, many celestial beings from the mountains had frequently visited, making the locals less curious about the visiting female cultivators from Changchun Palace. Only a few children pointed and shouted “fairy” or “fairy sister,” while the elders of the families had many taboos, fearing they might offend the divine female cultivators. However, the young fairies smiled gently; two of them even waved to the children, asking them to lower their voices and not make too much noise, without stopping their chatter.

Mi Yu understood Wei Ban’s intention; it was indeed true to protect the ladies, but it was also to allow this sword immortal to experience the customs and habits of Baoping Continent more thoroughly.

Mi Ban's goodwill was well understood by Mi Yu, and Lord Hidden Official had always advocated for adapting to local customs, so Mi Yu believed he could manage.

However, the one thing he found uncomfortable was the lack of sword energy, as there were too few sword cultivators and even fewer sword immortals in this foreign land.

The peaceful days here felt too sweet, almost like a dream, making Mi Yu reluctant to wake up. 

Thus, he took out the sword-raising calabash and indulged in a mouthful of the rice wine stored at Lou Po Mountain.

At that moment, the skin covering Mi Yu’s face was quite handsome. Although it could not compare to his true visage, it was still a worthy appearance.

Thus, after encountering the female cultivators from Changchun Palace, as they walked from the mountains to the riverside, Mi Yu felt two pairs of young women’s eyes scanning him as if they were ready to devour him.

At dusk, near the auspicious shop in Qilong Alley, the blind Daoist, whose butt seemed glued to the bench, had finally finished rambling about his own arduous breakthrough, his advancements in the Five Thunder Law, and the decent business of his grass shop, as well as the shortcomings of his two disciples, who were not very promising but still had some filial piety. Seeing that Shishi was left speechless, it seemed he had been shamed, so Daoist Jia Sheng went next door to continue his conversation. 

Shishi went to close the shop. Yesterday was like this, today was like this, and tomorrow would likely be the same. She didn’t quite understand why an old Daoist, who had barely crawled into the Ocean-Seeking realm, would compare himself with her. If he had true skills, he could go find someone to flaunt his glory, perhaps find his good buddy Chen Lingjun or Pei Qian.

Shishi entered her room, and although no one lived in the main house, she still kept it empty. Now, she closed the door and secretly opened the drawer, taking out her makeup mirror, rouge, and powder, not daring to take advantage of the public funds since they were all her rightful wages. Moreover, during festivals, Lou Po Mountain would give a few red envelopes with snowflake money. While this may not be much in the mountains, it was not insignificant in the market, so the items on the table were all purchased with her private funds.

As a female ghost clad in a layer of the celestial’s shedding, Shishi actually didn’t require sleep. However, in this small town, she didn’t dare to practice diligently under the cover of night, and as for those underhanded ghostly techniques, she wouldn’t dare to engage in them either, as it would be courting death. At that point, she wouldn’t need the Dali spies or the Longquan Sword Sect to do anything; Lou Po Mountain could make her unable to escape. Moreover, Shishi herself had no inclination for such things. She was quite content with the current leisurely days, where each day seemed like yesterday. Although she occasionally found it a bit dull, she was quite satisfied. The business of the auspicious shop was quite average, far from the prosperous business of the neighboring grass shop, which made her feel somewhat guilty.

Shishi formed a seal with her fingers, silently reciting in her heart, and then “undressed,” transforming into her true form as a female ghost. 

The shed skin remained sitting in the chair, unmoving, like a spirit wandering far away. 

After reverting to her true form, Shishi donned colorful clothes, a long skirt with wide sleeves, her figure graceful, reminiscent of her appearance when she was previously captured by the Liuli Fairy.

Being able to “wander” like this was thanks to Pei Qian, who had obtained this small spell for “going out” from her eldest junior brother, the Big White Goose. However, Pei Qian had warned her that it could last for no more than a stick of incense; otherwise, it would be difficult to return. At that time, she would no longer be concerned, as long as the Big White Goose was not around, there would be no way for her to manage. The young man in white had added with a grin that if she couldn’t return, she could slap herself half to death first, as she liked to look in the mirror. Afterward, her soul would be trapped in the mirror for her to look at. Although at that time, Cui Dongshan was reprimanded by Pei Qian, Shishi dared not take it lightly.

Shishi gently picked up a comb and began to groom herself in front of the mirror, gazing at her reflection, which now seemed almost unfamiliar.

This female ghost softly hummed an ancient song.

“Like a withered skeleton, with a heart like dead ashes, truly knowing, yet self-restrained. Murmurs obscure, without a heart, cannot be conspired with. Who is that person...?”

After Longquan County was elevated to Longzhou, it governed the four districts of Qingci, Baoxi, Sanjiang, and Xianghuo. The governor of a state was Wei Li, a former inspector from Huangting Kingdom, while Yuan Zhengding, a descendant of the Yuan clan, served as the magistrate of Qingci County, and Fu Yu, a former assistant of Wu Yuan, the first magistrate of Huaihuang County in the history of Lihuzhu Cave, had been promoted to magistrate of Baoxi County. The remaining two county lords were both from the Han clan and the capital officials, said to have no dealings with Yuan Zhengding and Fu Yu outside of administrative matters.

The current supervisor of the kiln, Cao Gengxin, continued to act as a lax supervisor, drinking or on his way to buy wine every day, still playing with children and being teased by women, while also fraternizing with men.

The civil and martial temples of Huaihuang County worship and offer sacrifices to the ancestors of Governor Yuan and Supervisor Cao.

Not only that, but now in Baoping Continent, at least half of the households displayed door gods, which were the portraits of the two ministers, Yuan and Cao, who had made great contributions to the resurgence of the Dali Song clan.

The city god temple in the state city was bustling with incense offerings. That little incense person, who claimed to have almost starved to death and was ridiculed by fellow practitioners, for some reason, initially enjoyed running around and showing off, but after being severely taught a lesson by the lord of the city god temple, he was pressed into the incense burner to eat ashes. Yet he still would not learn, jumping around in front of many high-ranking judges and gods of the city god temple, cursing the lord of the city god while pointing his nose at him, saying, “You ungrateful bastard, how much suffering have I endured following you? Now that I’ve finally made something of myself through real effort, you won’t allow me to show off a little?” 

“I harm no one, disturb no one, and I am diligent in helping you patrol your territory, helping you record the wandering souls that aren’t documented. What right do you have to manage me? You are a brainless fool who’s all wet behind the ears. If you keep yammering, I’ll just leave home and see who will dare to advise you later...”

This little rascal, who was said to have been thrown out of the city god temple along with the incense burner, later stealthily returned and still liked to gather a bunch of sycophants, instructing the two night roving gods who had become sworn brothers. “Your excellencies” would frequent the county and city god temples within a state, or shout through the streets and alleys at night, but later he suddenly turned into a different person, dismissing those lackeys and regularly leaving the city god temple to go to some place in the mountains, claiming to visit relatives and friends, rain or shine.

Today, a light rain fell, and a diligent little incense person, holding a small leaf “umbrella,” ran all the way to the gate of Lou Po Mountain.

The little rascal ran to Yuan Lai’s side, speaking in a grand manner, “Yuan Lai, have you been diligent in reading and practicing your punches lately?”

The boy, who had been sitting under the eaves reading, nodded with a smile, “Not bad.”

Visitors to Lou Po Mountain were rare. Yuan Lai, when he got tired of reading, would practice his stances, and when he got tired of practicing, he would read. Occasionally, he would catch sight of Miss Cen practicing her stances while passing by the mountain gate. A day would pass quickly, and at most, he would be slightly scolded by his sister a few times.

The little rascal chuckled, “If I see Miss Cen on the way up the mountain, should I send her your regards?”

Yuan Lai helplessly replied, “I wouldn’t dare trouble the right protector.”

The little rascal casually tossed aside the small leaf umbrella, put his hands behind his back, and began to walk around in circles on the muddy ground, frowning and sighing, “Remember, remember, I’m just the right protector of Qilong Alley. In the officialdom, addresses cannot be thrown around. If Guardian Zhou is present, you’d offend two high officials at once. If you were truly in an official capacity, you would be courting death with such addresses. Yuan Lai, you’re still too young; you must be cautious in the future. As someone temporarily helping Brother Dafu guard the mountain gate, even without an official title, you still represent the face of Lou Po Mountain. When dealing with others, there’s much to learn; how can you just read?”

After listening patiently to the little rascal's ramblings, Yuan Lai smiled, “Got it.”

Knowledge is not only found in books; the words of the little incense person also held truth. Even if the speaker had no intention, the listener could find meaning.

Senior Dafu had once instructed him to carefully observe others’ words and actions, as that was the best form of cultivation on the mountain. One shouldn’t act like a deaf person with their eyes wide open, wasting the feng shui of Lou Po Mountain.

The little rascal began to genuinely climb the mountain.

When he reached the cliff beside the bamboo building, he saw the right protector of Lou Po Mountain, who was in a daze at the edge of the cliff.

The little rascal mentioned the matter of reporting to Zhou Mi Li and made sure to remind Sister Nuan Shu to note it in the ledger, then curiously asked, “Where’s my brother Yu Mi?”

Zhou Mi Li rested her chin on her hand and said, “He went down the mountain to handle some affairs.”

The little rascal was indignant, “What kind of brother is this? He doesn’t even say goodbye before leaving; how heartless! A scoundrel like this, I wouldn’t want a basketful!”

Zhou Mi Li extended her hands to shield the little rascal from the wind and rain, laughing, “Why don’t you grow a bit?”

The little rascal replied earnestly, “The right protector’s teachings are correct. When I get to the officialdom, I will definitely eat more incense ashes.”

The girl lowered her head, bending slightly, and whispered, “Pei Qian said that flattery is the most undesirable. Our Lou Po Mountain has never indulged in such practices; this has been a family tradition since his master’s time.”

The little rascal suddenly realized and nodded vigorously, “The Mountain Lord has great foresight! The Master is unparalleled! Even the right protector is no less, your casual words are golden advice—not to mention the daily burden of the golden shoulder pole. If you could also bring back a jade pendant, that would be incredible; even the scholars and sages in the academy would be worthy of it! Right protector, once the Mountain Lord or the Master returns, I will definitely act as a loyal minister, boldly presenting advice to seek a jade pendant for the right protector…”

The girl tilted her head, frowning in confusion, as if she sensed something was off, and then suddenly understood, chuckling.

The little rascal also realized his slip of the tongue; the phrase “loyal minister” was a major taboo in Lou Po Mountain!

Zhou Mi Li covered her mouth with both hands and laughed heartily.

The little rascal also joined in the laughter, “Our right protector is quite refined!”

In the city of Yanzhi in the country of Caiyi, a pair of young men and women traveling south to explore Baoping Continent visited Mr. Fisher and bid farewell.

Mr. Wu Shuo Wen, known as Mr. Fisher, had just returned with his two disciples, Zhao Shuxia and Zhao Luan, from their travels in Old Dragon City and New South Mountain. Otherwise, the two visitors might have missed each other altogether.

A light rain had just stopped, and the young woman wore a hooded cloak, while the young man carried a straw hat on his back. After parting with the old scholar, they left the small alley.

These were Yu Lu and Xie Xie.

Among the friends from the academy, aside from the two who were not studying at the Cliff Academy in the capital of the Sui Dynasty, Lin Shouyi had already left early, only stating that he was going to tour the excavation of the Great Dike. Li Huai and Pei Qian had traveled to the Northern Julu Continent, and even Li Baoping, after returning from the Dali capital, had gone with dozens of classmates to travel in the Central Divine Continent with Master Mao Shan. Thus, among those who had traveled together to study in the Sui Dynasty, only Cui Dongshan, who had left the academy early, remained in the capital.

Regarding the matter of traveling to the Central Divine Continent, Master Mao Shan had consulted Yu Lu and Xie Xie’s opinions. Xie Xie received a letter from Cui Dongshan and politely declined the old sage's invitation, as she truly feared that the young man in white would command her to follow his orders, which felt quite authoritative.

Yu Lu had no particular thoughts about the Central Divine Continent's cultural temples and academies, so he simply accompanied Xie Xie southward to prevent her from encountering any accidents while traveling alone. In Yu Lu’s view, Xie Xie’s temperament was still more suitable for cultivating in the mountains than for traveling alone.

So in the end, among their former companions, it seemed that only Li Baoping had gone to the Central Divine Continent.

He and Xie Xie were both at bottlenecks—one an Earthly realm martial artist and the other an Ocean-Seeking Qi practitioner.

Yu Lu had become a seven-realm martial artist early on, yet he had not broken through the Golden Body realm due to a lack of life-and-death combat experiences to sharpen his martial path.

Previously, at Lou Po Mountain, Yu Lu privately consulted Zhu Xian and benefited greatly, which led to this journey to explore the ancient battlefields in Baoping Continent.

As for Xie Xie, she had been restrained by the Dragon Binding Nail for many years, which had somewhat damaged her fundamental Dao. Over the years, she had been carefully mending her physical condition. However, this was not the crucial issue. The real reason hindering her breakthrough was her heavy “heart demon.” With many unresolved emotional ties, her sect was destroyed, her country fell, and later she became a remnant of a convict. She was subsequently struck by the wife of the Dali Empress, who had used secret techniques to embed the Dragon Binding Nail into her soul, severely injuring her vitality. Eventually, she met the unpredictable Cui Dongshan, and after leaving her hometown, her situation had been extremely difficult. Otherwise, given Xie Xie’s exceptional aptitude for cultivation, she should have already become a Golden Core earth immortal by now.

The bottlenecks they faced were significant challenges, especially concerning their combat power, representing the greatest thresholds for a pure martial artist and a Qi practitioner.

Once a pure martial artist ascended to the realm of exploration, they could ride the winds and engage in combat with Qi practitioners, which was a world apart from the Golden Body realm.

As for whether a Qi practitioner could become a Golden Core guest, the significance was self-evident.

The Lu Dynasty, as the dominant nation of the historical Dali Song clan, was undoubtedly the northern overlord of Baoping Continent. Xie Xie had been nurtured by her sect as a future upper-five-realm practitioner since she was young.

Yu Lu, as the former prince of the Lu Dynasty, had some understanding of the affairs on his mountain, and regarding Xie Xie, there had always been a saying that compared her to He Xiaoliang from the Shenzhao Sect, except that she lacked the right fortune.

However, now it seemed that the two were worlds apart.

He Xiaoliang had become the sect master of the Northern Julu Continent, at the Yu Pu realm, and the Dao was promising. The great sword immortal Bai Chang from Northern Julu had stated that he would prevent He Xiaoliang from ever ascending. This implied that the great sword immortal would intervene, otherwise, He Xiaoliang, as the sect master of the Qingliang Sect, was destined to become a great immortal in the ascension realm.

In contrast, Xie Xie was no longer even a Golden Core practitioner.

Yu Lu was a relaxed person; he could take his time with his martial path, but Xie Xie was strong-willed and competitive, making her emotions over the years quite evident.

At a corner of the street, Xie Xie glanced back at the alley and softly said, “Is that Zhao Luan?”

Yu Lu smiled and said, “Don’t ask me; I know nothing and saw nothing.”

Xie Xie glared at this prince of a ruined nation, “What else can you do besides act dumb?”

Yu Lu laughed, “Nothing else.”

Xie Xie said, “Zhao Luan’s cultivation aptitude is exceptional. The worries expressed by Mr. Wu are not without reason. He should be helping Zhao Luan secure a genealogy identity. Mr. Wu may lack other things, but that demeanor is not missing; he wouldn’t allow Zhao Luan to waste time like this just because of their master-disciple relationship. Since Zhao Luan has already reached the Cave Dwelling realm, it’s not difficult for him to become a genealogy celestial teacher. The challenge lies in becoming a direct disciple of a major celestial sect, such as…”

At this point, Xie Xie stared blankly at Yu Lu, realizing that he was better at thinking things through. She had to admit it.

Yu Lu continued, “Yunxia Mountain or Changchun Palace, or perhaps… the Ancestor Hall of the Aoyui Zhu Chai Island. Yunxia Mountain has a better future and aligns with Zhao Luan's temperament, but unfortunately, neither of us has connections. Changchun Palace is the safest option, but it requires asking Lord Wei for help. As for Liu Chongrun from Aoyui Zhu Chai Island, even you and I could negotiate this, and it wouldn’t be difficult, but we fear it may delay Zhao Luan’s progress in cultivation. After all, Liu Chongrun is only at the Golden Core level. Considering this, it would be better to rely on oneself. With your half-Golden Core status, personally guiding Zhao Luan should suffice. Unfortunately, you fear trouble and the risk of overstepping, which would inevitably displeasure Mr. Cui.”

Xie Xie huffed, “Going around in circles, but in the end, you said nothing!”

Yu Lu laughed, “At least we know what not to do; it’s not completely wasted on my part, nor yours.”

Xie Xie fell silent, finding arguing with Yu Lu rather dull.

Compared to Xie Xie's concerns, which were mostly on the splendid Zhao Luan, Yu Lu was actually more focused on Zhao Shuxia, who was wholeheartedly practicing her punches.

Xie Xie said, “Zhao Shuxia mentioned he has a bet of five hundred thousand punches with Chen Pingan, and now he’s still short by eighteen thousand punches. As a martial artist, have you seen Zhao Shuxia’s punch intent?”

Yu Lu replied, “There’s indeed not much.”

Xie Xie frowned, “Does that mean he’s practiced to the point of stagnation?”

Yu Lu shook his head, “It’s not quite like that.”

Xie Xie expressed her confusion, “Since Chen Pingan came here before and taught Zhao Shuxia martial arts, did he really just give him a method and then neglect him? That doesn’t seem like his style.”

Yu Lu laughed, “Don’t worry; Chen Pingan definitely has his own plans.”

Xie Xie asked, “Is he going to Lou Po Mountain?”

Yu Lu shook his head, “Not necessarily.”

Afterward, Yu Lu led Xie Xie through the night to rest at a dilapidated ancient temple on the border between Caiyi and Shushui countries.

Xie Xie removed her hood and looked around, asking, “Is this the place where Chen Pingan once told you that there would be beautiful ghosts visiting at night?”

Yu Lu lit a bonfire and smiled, “If you want to scold men for being no good, just say it. I’ll accept it on Chen Pingan’s behalf.”

Thus, Xie Xie’s carefully prepared words had no chance to be used.

Yu Lu casually laid his walking stick across his knees and began flipping through a scholar’s notes.

Xie Xie hugged her knees, gazing into the flickering firelight, “If I remember correctly, during the early days of our travels, you and Chen Pingan seemed to particularly enjoy keeping watch at night?”

Yu Lu chuckled softly, “I don’t know what Chen Pingan thinks, but as for me, I didn’t particularly enjoy it, but it wasn’t considered a hardship. The only thing that annoyed me was Li Huai at midnight...”

“Can you tell me?”

Xie Xie said, “You tell me, and I’ll forget.”

Yu Lu recounted, “Li Huai has a timid personality and isn’t very familiar with me. If I’m on watch, he would pull me to a distance, making up some excuse like ‘freeing the water,’ which was fine for a quick resolve. But when it came to fertilizing, he didn’t want me too close and feared I was too far away. He would keep asking me if I was still there. When I didn’t respond, he cried out, searching for someone, and when he saw I was standing still, he huffed and stormed back, which was quite... a sight I’d rather forget. Fortunately, at that time, Li Huai was still a mere child.”

Xie Xie bluntly commented, “That’s disgusting.”

Yu Lu tossed a dry branch into the fire, laughing, “Whenever Chen Pingan was on watch, back then, Baoping was carefree; even if the sky fell, with her little master uncle around, she could sleep soundly. You and Lin Shouyi were already cultivators then, and your minds were at ease. I, however, always had a light sleep, and I often heard Li Huai chasing after Chen Pingan, asking if he smelled good.”

Xie Xie interrupted, “Forget it; I’d rather you change the subject.”

Yu Lu casually poked at the edges of the bonfire with a branch. The branches in early spring were still moist, often crackling and releasing droplets of water, while the dry branches in autumn would burn silently.

Yu Lu smiled, “Chen Pingan would answer, ‘If only it were wild vegetables; however, it’s easy to attract barking dogs.’”

Xie Xie rolled her eyes.

Yu Lu glanced up at Xie Xie and said, “There are many amusing things, not just this one. During our travels, it was always the same trivial matters. So don’t blame Li Huai for being closest to Chen Pingan. We can’t compare, and Lin Shouyi is no exception. Lin Shouyi may seem annoyed with Li Huai, but in his heart, he’s not vexed; the only one he truly isn’t annoyed with is Chen Pingan.”

Xie Xie angrily replied, “What’s the point of blaming that?”

Yu Lu turned his gaze toward the ancient temple's door, which creaked open. A wave of chilly spring air rushed in, and a pair of embroidered shoes, stained with mud, crossed the threshold.

The owner of those embroidered shoes was a girl with almond eyes and a round face, holding a lantern as she hurried along.

Yu Lu chuckled, having learned from experience, this girl, one of the Four Fiends of Shushui Country, had made progress.

Behind the girl was a tall, cold-faced woman with her hair styled in a high bun, resembling a refined young lady who had lost her way with her maid at night.

The girl glanced at the walking stick resting on Yu Lu's knee, made of ordinary green bamboo, but it made her eyelids twitch. Suddenly, she stopped and asked, “Excuse me, do you know Chen Pingan?”

Yu Lu smiled and nodded, “It seems I do.”

The girl, whose real name was Wei Wei, stomped her foot and turned to leave.

The tall woman quickly followed suit, clearly frightened of the young man named Chen Pingan.

That night passed without incident.

Yu Lu and Xie Xie first visited a beautiful place before heading to Shushui Country's Jian Water Villa.

Finally, at a battlefield site on the border of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, they encountered a pair of男女 who could be considered half-friends: Su Dian, a young female martial artist from Yang’s family shop, and Shi Ling Shan, her junior brother, who was always wary of men.

Because Shi Ling Shan was on edge every day, fearing that the bastard Zheng Dafu would speak ill of him and call a certain man “senior brother-in-law,” he had to resort to the killer move taught by Zheng Dafu and privately approach the overly handsome Yu Lu, claiming to be Su Dian's son, not her junior brother. As a result, he was sent flying seven or eight zhang away by the sharp-eyed Su Dian, leaving him sprawled on the ground for some time.

Mi Yu quickly got a sense of this group of Changchun Palace sisters.

They shared their stories openly, with no need for Mi Yu to probe further.

The graceful girl, now known as Zhongnan, had just entered the middle-level realm, which was why she was traveling. 

The other three female cultivators, who were contemporaries of Zhongnan, were named Chu Mengjiao, who hailed from a scholarly family in the Dali capital. It was said that there was a knowledgeable “Hanlin Ghost” in her ancestral home who served as a tutor, with many in the family achieving success.

Another was named Lin Caifu, whose mother had given her this name. On the day of her birth, a seller of the Duanwu Festival talismans had visited and claimed a connection with the Lin family, hence she received this name.

Lastly, there was a girl named Han Biya, who came from a family of military officials, although her ancestors held relatively minor positions, with the highest being a patrol officer. Yet, the wisteria in the Han family courtyard was one of the oldest in the capital, blooming vibrantly and filling the air with fragrance, renowned alongside the peonies at the Guo Temple in the Dali capital.

None of them had yet reached the Cave Dwelling realm.

In Baoping Continent, a mid-level celestial, even a mere Cave Dwelling cultivator, was regarded as a precious entity, while in smaller nations, Cave Dwelling and Ocean-Seeking cultivators were seen as major demons or fierce ghosts.

As for the old woman from the Dragon Gate realm, she had been a celestial teacher from Changchun Palace since her youth.

The female Qi practitioners of the Supreme Elder lineage at Changchun Palace did not shy away from matters of love; rather, they viewed them as essential experiences on the path of cultivation.

Their journey south was to undergo training and would not be just sightseeing.

After Zhongnan’s “return to her roots,” they would head to the Dali affiliated Huangting Kingdom’s border to deal with a painting demon haunting the Yun Mountain Temple. In the temple's guesthouse, there hung an ancient painting with a long history. Whenever the moon shone at night, the person in the painting would walk along the wall in the absence of people, much like a lantern show in the market. The painting demon often caused disturbances on moonlit nights, though it did no harm, it hindered the temple's reputation, prompting Yun Mountain Temple to seek assistance from the Dali Ministry of Rites, leading Changchun Palace to take on this task.

Afterward, in a small nation that had submitted to the Dali Song clan, they were to help an old celestial with deep ties to Changchun Palace ascend.

They would then head to the territory of the former Zhu Ying Dynasty to assist the soul of a Dali general who had died in battle to return home.

Lastly, there was a secret task to procure a small piece of ten-thousand-year-old pine from the Fengxue Temple’s celestial platform. This was the most challenging task, and the old woman had not elaborated on it to the four female cultivators, nor had she fully explained it to “Yu Mi,” hoping that when Yu Mi arrived at Fengxue Temple, he could tactfully assist. Mi Yu smiled and agreed, saying he would do his best. However, given his relationship with the celestial sword immortal at the celestial platform, if he happened to find him there, he might muster the courage to make a bold request. If the sword immortal wasn’t present, then “Yu Mi” was merely a fortuitous mountain dweller, and upon meeting any old deities, he would likely feel intimidated. 

The old woman also stated that this matter could not be forced; it would be enough if Yu Mi was willing to say a few good words.

Their journey southward for training would generally involve these four tasks, each with its challenges and opportunities for growth. With Yu Mi, a deeply rooted Ocean-Seeking practitioner, the old woman felt a bit more at ease.

Upon reaching the bustling Hongzhu Town, Zhongnan headed for her hometown’s water bay alone.

For a boat girl of lowly birth, that water bay was two entirely different worlds from Hongzhu Town.

A girl from a humble background could not even step onto the roads along the banks of Hongzhu Town; any violation would lead to dire consequences, as she could be exiled to the Dali border to serve as a laborer, leading to an even worse fate.

Mi Yu and the others settled into an inn. With the celestial teacher’s documents from Changchun Palace, they had no expenses to worry about.

Upon arriving at the inn in Hongzhu Town, Mi Yu glanced at the peak of Qidun Mountain and shook his head, surprised to find that Wei Ban was also a romantic at heart, truly a kindred spirit. No wonder they got along so well.

As dusk approached, Mi Yu left the inn for a solitary stroll. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 807: A Difficult Reunion in the Jianghu (Part Two)

Although it had only been a few days since Mi Yu started traveling with the ladies from Changchun Palace, he had already uncovered many nuances about their world. It turned out that even among the same ranks of celestial masters, backgrounds could create a hierarchy. They spoke with smooth words, but at certain moments, their expressions betrayed their true feelings. Take the young lady Zhong Nan for example; despite her high status, she had once been the daughter of a lowly boatman and had only entered Changchun Palace at a young age. As a result, a line was drawn in the hearts of the others—Chu Mengjiao, Lin Caifu, and Han Biya—who were of similar age to her "ancestor." When Zhong Nan previously invited them to gather at a small boat by the water, they all politely declined.

This seemingly kind gesture was not without ulterior motives.

Mi Yu paused and turned slowly. The trio of Chu Mengjiao had just noticed his stop and began to browse a bamboo fan stall nearby. 

The more perceptive ones turned quickly, while the more playful ones took their time.

Mi Yu approached them to greet them and soon found himself enjoying the scenery together with them. 

Beauty and beautiful sights; neither was wasted on him.

After all, he had already confirmed that the one Wei Shanjun secretly adored was not any of them.

The land once known as Qizhuang Mountain, now the Beiyue Mountain Lord, was enveloped in the celestial scroll of fairies, with his heart following the flying birds to Zhong Nan.

As the sun began to set, Mi Yu glanced at his shadow and asked the three ladies about the celestial techniques that the cultivators on the mountain used to capture the wind and shadows. Were they truly real? If so, that would be quite frightening.

While conversing, his gaze lingered on them. Yu Mi, the wild cultivator, never favored one over the others, treating each girl with equal courtesy. 

Unfortunately, Wei Jin never had the chance to truly appreciate Mi Jianxian's unique abilities.

In a quiet alley connecting Guanshui Street and Guanshan Street in Hongzhu Town, there was a small bookstore that did not boast much fame.

Today, a young gentleman dressed in black reclined on a chair, flipping through a newly published strange tales novel from the Dali folk. The faint scent of ink wafted through the air.

This gentleman, under the alias Li Jin, was actually the Water God of the Chongdan River. Beside his chair sat an exquisite flower table, on which rested a teapot crafted by a renowned potter from the old Lu dynasty—a simple yet elegant purple clay pot. It was said that only eighteen genuine pieces still existed in the world, half of which belonged to the Song family of Dali and the other half to the immortals of Baoping Continent, earning the reputation of "palace tales and mountain competition." An old scholar who often visited the shop was immediately intrigued and asked the shopkeeper if he could take a look at the teapot. Li Jin humorously replied that he could take a look if he bought a book. The old scholar nodded in agreement, carefully lifting the teapot. Upon examining the inscription, he lamented that it was a fake. If it had been crafted by another potter, it might have been real, but since it was this potter, it was undoubtedly a counterfeit. How could such a small bookstore in a mundane neighborhood possibly possess such a priceless teapot? Nevertheless, before leaving, the old scholar still paid for a rare book. The small shop had strict rules and never haggled; the ancient texts were generally in good condition, but it was challenging to negotiate for a fair price.

Li Jin accepted the money and tossed it into the drawer at the counter, continuing to lounge in comfort, sipping tea while reading.

Nowadays, any literate individual from the old Dali dynasty, even those who had fallen from grace and had no hope of passing the imperial examinations, could still make a living. As long as they ventured outside, no one would be left destitute. Most could compile a book by piecing together notes, and booksellers would line up at various bookstores in Dali's capital, ready to buy. The only condition was that the preface of the book had to be written by a local official with some rank. If they could find a high-ranking official from the Hanlin Academy, they would receive a substantial advance, regardless of the book's quality. It wasn’t that the booksellers were foolish or had too much money; it was that Dali's literati had become increasingly sought after in Baoping Continent.

Li Jin initially lost interest upon seeing the preface, which was written by a minor official from the Ministry of Rites—merely literate but not impressive. However, he was surprised by the quality of the articles that followed, and he diligently noted down the author's name.

This wayward Water God of the Chongdan River still preferred selling books in Hongzhu Town. As for the temple of the Water God at Chongdan River, Li Jin casually found an honest temple keeper to manage the incense offerings. Occasionally, some devout believers, whose prayers were particularly sincere, would share their wishes with him. He would weigh them and grant some that were not too excessive. However, if someone sought instant wealth or a high-ranking position, Li Jin would ignore them. After all, he was just a minor water deity, not the heavens themselves.

Li Jin had recently appointed a few drowned spirits and hanged female ghosts to patrol his territory, all of whom had grievances in life and did not wish to find a living person to replace them in death. If they clashed with the spirits of Chongdan River or Yuye River, they would endure it; if it became unbearable, they could come to him, the Water God, to vent their frustrations before returning to endure their hardship again. Despite the difficulties of life, it was still better than the fate of a hungry ghost that had no descendants to honor them.

Li Jin's only genuine concern was for those families with deep ancestral blessings, or those children who were scholars, as well as the virtuous and upright individuals—some of whom needed a little support, while others required some attention. For those ordinary folks who had accumulated good deeds but were physically weak, Li Jin would use his divine powers to guide them with a couple of large red lanterns at night to prevent them from being disturbed by restless spirits. These lanterns were not something that just any practitioner could see; only earth immortals or those skilled in divination among the middle-tier practitioners could see them. However, just as there were a fixed number of deities within a nation, depending on its fortunes and the size of its mountains and rivers, these red lanterns also depended on the rank of the deities. They were not items to be given away lightly. Some of the more mercenary water deities might offer conveniences to wealthy families, as long as they didn’t overstep their bounds or get reported by neighbors or superiors. The Ministry of Rites would not fuss too much over such matters.

Recently, Li Jin personally hung two lanterns—one behind a poor street youth and another outside his home. The former would stay closely attached to him, visible day and night; any filthy spirits that saw it would flee. Moreover, Li Jin wrote "Secretly crafted by the Water God of Chongdan River" on the candles within the lanterns, clearly indicating that this was a person under his protection. No ghost or practitioner would dare disturb the youth's spirit, for that would mean challenging him, the Water God of Chongdan River.

Some deities dedicated themselves to literary pursuits and were particularly fond of scholars within their territories. Once a scholar achieved fame, it added to the merit of the local deities in the Ministry of Rites. Others might focus on martial prowess, protecting loyal and righteous figures, and so on. 

Thus, it was said that being human was difficult, and being a ghost or deity was not easy either.

Among the ghosts, there were even more taboos. A small mistake could provoke retaliation from the underworld officials. In remote areas, it might be easier, but in large towns, it was perilous. The longer a dynasty lasted, the greater the power of the deities, and the less daring the ghosts were to cause trouble. Besides the water deities and the temples of civil and military gods, there were numerous temples and high-status residences with guardian spirits, making it challenging for unclean spirits to find a foothold. Moreover, within the realm of spirits, various absurd bullying incidents occurred, just like the sordid affairs of the living.

Merit manifested, righteousness commanded respect, and ghosts scattered, avoiding paths—they were never mere empty words.

The business at the shop was slow, and Li Jin missed the two regular customers who often helped out: Brother Feng and Brother Zhu. Whenever they came to buy books, they did so with such generosity, often purchasing several bags full.

His acquaintance with Zhu Lian stemmed from the incident involving the Yuye River, and Zhu Lian began frequenting the shop afterward. Although the Water Goddess of Yuye River had escaped accountability from the Ministry of Rites, it was evident that her case was recorded in the Ministry's files because Li Jin was familiar with a certain doctor within. The Ministry of Personnel's performance evaluation section, the Ministry of War's martial selection section, and the Ministry of Rites' sacrificial regulation section were all headed by officials of the fifth rank. However, they held great power, especially the sacrificial regulation section, which specifically managed the merits and demerits of all the water deities in Dali. This made it particularly important, thus earning the mountain's respect, referring to it as a "minor heavenly official." Recently, the doctor had visited the three-river territory in disguise and stopped by the bookstore to reminisce for a while. The reason for this esteemed doctor’s visit to Hongzhu Town was undoubtedly due to the troubles caused by the Water Goddess of Yuye River.

As a peer of the Water Goddess, Li Jin could not be said to take pleasure in her misfortune, but he felt a tinge of sympathy. Even as a river deity, the way of the universe was ever-changing, and he remained perpetually busy.

Of course, because Li Jin's dreams had come true and he had successfully become the Water God, his ambitions were not grand, allowing him to maintain a leisurely pace. If he wished to climb further, to elevate the status of Chongdan River to that of Tiefu River or to become a first-rate water god like Yanghua, he would indeed have to work harder.

Li Jin closed the book and tossed it casually to his chest, beginning to rest his eyes.

He reminisced about his conversations with Zhu Lian. If they set aside their identities and positions, they had a great rapport. Li Jin would even be willing to let Zhu Lian recline in the chair while he stood at the counter.

He remembered Zhu Lian once joking, "I don't necessarily believe in the teachings of monks, nor do I have faith in Confucian scholars. I trust in the principles of sages, but not the sages themselves."

Zhu Lian from Luopo Mountain was indeed a rare figure, not just skilled in martial arts but also in knowledge.

Just then, a customer entered. Li Jin opened his eyes, raised the teapot, and took a sip, lazily saying, "Feel free to browse, no need to haggle."

He glanced over to see a smiling middle-aged man and three young ladies in ceremonial robes from Changchun Palace. Li Jin could tell at a glance that their cultivation levels were not high.

As a river deity with mastery over the flow of fortune in his territory, being able to discern the fates of those in his shop was a unique ability. Among the three young female cultivators, each had decent luck, and beyond their celestial connections, they also carried hints of literary, martial, and mountain fortunes. It was not as simple as those who practiced the Dao cutting ties with worldly affairs.

Only the middle-aged man remained unreadable to Li Jin.

It was as if he were a true immortal, vague yet distinct.

Li Jin was slightly taken aback, quickly deciding to disregard him. If the man was indeed an earth immortal, it would be disrespectful to pry into his affairs.

It was akin to facing a pure warrior like Zhu Lian, who would throw punches and shout without reason. 

Mi Yu had not been overly courteous to any of the girls, always remaining respectful.

Spending time with multiple women, even a hint of favoritism could lead to embarrassment. A woman’s pride was delicate; thus, a man often ended up with nothing, at most gaining the heart of one beauty, while the others remained strangers.

Of course, Mi Jianxian held no ulterior motives. His outing was for serious business.

At the border of Huangting Kingdom, he had come to deal with the painting demon of Yunshan Temple. The ladies of Changchun Palace handled it with ease; the mural woman was just a ghost at the cave realm, but Mi Yu found the experience visually pleasing. Yunshan Temple was very grateful, and the local officials had forged a connection with Changchun Palace, resulting in a pleasing outcome.

However, in that small place called Yunshui County, deep within a rocky cave, the "old immortal" at the bottleneck of the Longmen realm opened Mi Yu's eyes. He was astonished to see that there were practitioners who had turned their own bodies into prisons for their spiritual souls. This old cultivator had been embedded in the stone wall for decades, suffering greatly with hair like vines trailing to the ground. His skin had become indistinguishable from wood and stone. Such a pitiful fate was rare; he had stumbled upon a fragment of a true scroll during the day but had been reluctant to reveal his teachings. Misguided in his practice, he found himself trapped—a sad truth for the wild cultivators. Even with celestial roots and affinities, without guidance from a mountain master, how could he hope for ascension?

After years of entrapment, the old cultivator's spirit was worn down, nearly decayed. He could only rely on dreams to reach out to a woodcutter, asking him to inform the local officials, hoping for a sword to carry his message to Changchun Palace to assist in his liberation. If successful, the messenger would receive a generous reward.

Mi Yu, understanding the situation, chose not to approach the stone wall as an outsider. He mentioned that he would wait at the foot of the mountain. After all, that old Golden Elixir cultivator had spoken emphatically about the remaining fragments of the teachings, claiming that "if one could complete them, a practitioner could directly ascend to the fifth realm." Such teachings were coveted by many earth immortals.

His knowledge of these matters came from his use of the divine ability to observe mountains and rivers, merely to glance. If he were to covet such an opportunity, it would be a humiliation for him, Mi Yu.

The old woman from Changchun Palace was already prepared. She carefully took out a short sword of significant rank from a wooden box and, using the unique secret technique of Changchun Palace, she dispatched the old immortal. She then captured his soul within a precious item—a jade sculpture of a dragon, an artifact from the ancient Shu kingdom's royal tomb. This item had been collected by a certain ancestor of Changchun Palace during a search for immortal ruins and was known to nourish souls well.

The so-called liberation and reincarnation were mere pretexts; true reincarnation was not so simple. A minor Longmen cultivator did not warrant such treatment from Changchun Palace. The old cultivator lacked the cultivation and roots necessary to discuss maintaining one’s spiritual essence during reincarnation. Without that crucial essence, even reincarnation would leave one unable to remember past lives.

In exchange for the teachings, the old cultivator would be given a position as a ghostly guest in one of Changchun Palace's subordinate sects, continuing his cultivation. Should he eventually achieve Golden Elixir, he could become a registered worshipper of Changchun Palace.

Mi Yu sat at the foot of the mountain on a large tree branch, leisurely sipping the rice wine brewed in his sword nurturing gourd, increasingly feeling the busyness of an ordinary celestial sect in the vast world.

Just dealing with the local officials, celestial inns, divine ferry crossings, and mountain sects, one had to speak the language of humans when meeting mortals, the language of ghosts when meeting spirits, and the detached celestial language when encountering deities. Besides that, everyone had to diligently cultivate. The elders had to teach the younger generation, helping them grow while also ensuring they remained loyal to their sect—truly exhausting.

Mi Yu began to understand why the Hidden Official was the Hidden Official.

Because the Hidden Official was an expert in this field, young yet already among the best.

From the old woman’s discussions with various people, Mi Yu, who considered himself an outsider, noticed many flaws. For instance, when conversing with senior figures from the mountain, her expressions, especially her eyes, seemed insincere—far from the heartfelt and natural demeanor of the Hidden Official, whose sincerity was undeniable. Yet, when speaking with other youthful disciples from the mountain, she revealed an arrogance that was insufficiently concealed. When she should have been assertive, she spoke too much, her expression overly forced, leaving Mi Yu feeling her words lacked weight and intimidation.

In the midst of laughter, a narrowed gaze could swiftly turn lethal.

After successfully resolving the matter of "liberation," the old woman felt good upon reuniting at the foot of the mountain. This was likely connected to the earlier amiable departure of Yu Mi.

Afterward, they visited a newly built martial temple to retrieve a piece of armor for the spirit of a fallen general, allowing the spirit to wander during the night without being hindered by the harsh winds of the world. During the day, the general's spirit would transform into a wisp of blue smoke, hidden within an incense burner that the old woman had acquired, engraved with "Inner Altar for the Jiao Society." Then, Zhong Nan would personally light a stick of incense, using mountain incense when crossing mountains and water incense when crossing rivers. Throughout, Zhong Nan would hold the incense burner, rarely flying, at most riding a celestial ferry to ignite a stick of specially crafted incense from Yunxia Mountain.

Even at night, the general’s spirit remained silent, and Mi Yu noticed that the young female cultivators seemed to speak less in his presence.

Historically, fierce generals possessed unyielding spirits, and upon death, their heroic aura remained, earning them the title of "heroic spirits."

The cultivators of Changchun Palace were tasked with guiding the heroic spirit to the capital of Dali in Tonglu County, where the spirit would first serve as a local deity. If the Ministry of Rites approved their assessment, it would not be long before he could be elevated to the position of county magistrate.

During this journey, only two minor incidents occurred. One was in a county town where they encountered ghostly disturbances, causing three hunters to fall into a deep slumber, wandering at night. After meeting, they stood in place, slapping each other’s cheeks, and even the local deities were at a loss.

The old woman instructed "Shigu" Zhong Nan to set up a ritual platform and report it to the Ministry of Thunder to summon divine generals. Eventually, they successfully captured an old fox spirit from the Sea Observation realm, who lamented bitterly, crying out to the female cultivators about the hunters who had killed dozens of its descendants. It questioned how they could settle the score, claiming that if it hadn’t intervened, the three hunters would have been dead long ago. 

The old woman, uninterested in the fox spirit's complaints, intended to punish it with thunder magic. However, Zhong Nan managed to mediate, and they resolved the conflict. She reminded the old fox to cultivate diligently and be cautious about its dwelling, warning it not to be easily found by the woodcutters and hunters. The old woman was not pleased and chastised the fox harshly, insisting that one should not be so soft-hearted towards mountain spirits and ghosts.

Throughout, Mi Yu merely observed coldly, sitting on the railing and sipping wine.

If the Hidden Official were present, the outcome would likely have been different.

However, the girl named Han Biya did catch Mi Yu's attention. He silently muttered, "The old fox admitting its wrongs is enough; no need for compensation."

Mi Yu heard her clearly.

After all, he was a sword immortal.

Later, in the remote mountains, they encountered a female cultivator from Dali's army out on a journey. She wore a military-style blade at her waist but had changed out of her armor into a narrow-sleeved brocade outfit and dark gauze trousers, with delicate embroidered shoes that glimmered like dragon eyes at night, shining brightly.

At a scenic pavilion atop the mountain, she crossed paths with the ladies of Changchun Palace.

At that moment, she was stepping on the back of a kneeling mountain god, who was lamenting a secret matter involving celestial masters within its territory. She, meanwhile, tilted her head back to drink. Upon spotting the group of Changchun Palace ladies, she wiped her mouth, tossing the empty wine jug off the cliff and pointed elsewhere, making it clear that this space was already claimed and they should find another place.

The old woman frowned. Changchun Palace had a hereditary celestial incantation that could refine the morning glow and moonlight. Every fifteenth day, especially at midnight, they would select a spiritually rich mountaintop to refine the moonlight.

Undoubtedly, this location was the best for cultivation tonight.

If they moved elsewhere, the refinement of the moonlight tonight and the morning glow would be significantly compromised.

The woman kicked the mountain god, who had just been listed in the Ministry's records, and it immediately fled underground, unwilling to be involved in the conflicts of deities.

What truly made the old woman unwilling to back down was the woman's disdainful words: "You ladies from Changchun Palace, I haven’t seen a single one on the battlefield, yet you all suddenly appear like bamboo shoots after rain?"

Furthermore, she raised her head and muttered something even more inflammatory, "And it’s not even raining."

Mi Yu, standing nearby, maintained a blank expression but found her words quite pleasant to hear. It felt reminiscent of the Hidden Official's tone—warm, indeed.

Ultimately, the reason this matter didn’t escalate into chaos was simple. The female cultivator proposed a sparring match. Setting aside her identity as a military cultivator from Dali, she suggested they compete without any life-and-death stakes. They just had to remember no one should cry out for help from their sect; that would spoil the fun.

Upon hearing that the opponent hailed from the Wenqing Peak of the Fengxue Temple, the old woman lost her temper and proactively apologized.

The woman likely found that even more uninteresting, promptly taking off on the wind.

Mi Yu observed her and thought she resembled the taste of local liquor.

Afterward, the old woman led the ladies, including Zhong Nan, to practice breathing exercises within the pavilion.

Mi Yu, once again, drifted away on his own.

Somewhere else in the mountains, he lay on a branch of an ancient tree, drinking alone.

He pulled out a yellow talisman related to mountain and water decrees and ignited it with a bit of sword energy before tossing it out.

Before long, the small mountain god appeared beneath the tree, calling out to him as "Celestial Master."

Mi Yu inquired about the situation and found it amusing. It turned out that nearby, the river god had a penchant for taking female ghosts as concubines. One female ghost had submitted a request to the local land deity but was betrayed to the river god, nearly facing execution. The ghost continued to petition the county magistrate, but the river god, being accustomed to tyranny, dragged her by the hair into the magistrate's temple, intending to execute her before the magistrate's friends. Fortunately, a female cultivator happened to pass by and, bound by Dali's established mountain and water laws, could only report the incident to the Ministry of Rites. However, she found it difficult to personally slay the river god, land deity, and magistrate. So, she had come to the mountain to unwind, venting her frustrations on the hapless mountain god, citing negligence.

Mi Yu recalled something and asked, "If one has military merits, according to Dali's military rules, could they not exchange them for a head? That woman seems to have quite the reputation on the battlefield."

The mountain god carefully replied, "That female celestial master indeed possesses many military merits. She has built a significant reputation on the battlefield; even a certain Dali patrol envoy has praised her, a fact I’ve heard even as a minor deity. However, I’ve heard she has given her honors to a friend."

Mi Yu sat on the branch, waving his hand and laughing, "The mountain god should just calm down."

He muttered to himself, "She truly is a good girl."

Suddenly, Mi Yu turned his head sharply.

Not far away, on another branch, stood a woman with a sword at her waist, her posture elegant.

Mi Yu fell silent for a moment, then asked with a smile, "That female ghost?"

The woman remained silent.

Mi Yu had no choice but to drink alone.

She sneered, "How can someone who travels with the ladies of Changchun Palace dare to pretend to be a swordsman and rogue?"

Mi Yu chuckled, "To be honest, I’ve met the great sword immortal Wei and even had a drink together."

The woman froze for a moment, gripping the hilt of her sword, and angrily exclaimed, "You dare to slander Master Wei?!"

Mi Yu, feeling helpless, thought, Was Wei Jin blind? How could he not see such a woman?

He raised his hands in surrender, "I must have been possessed by a ghost. Please don’t be angry, elder sister. How could I possibly know the great sword immortal Wei? I’m just a wild cultivator drinking local rice wine..."

The woman coldly retorted, "Master Wei would never judge friends by their cultivation level or social standing. Please be careful with your words!"

Clearly, the woman did not wish to continue conversing with him and disappeared like a bird darting through the trees.

Mi Yu lay back on the branch, feeling his mood lift slightly.

Finally, the ladies of Changchun Palace arrived at the mountain gate of Fengxue Temple, but Yu Mi mentioned he had to leave for a while. They agreed to meet at a celestial ferry.

Mi Yu indeed had matters to attend to. He found the fisherman in Yanzhi County, introduced himself as Yu Mi, a registered worshipper of Luopo Mountain, and brought a handwritten letter from Wei Shanjun along with some incidents from years past to help prove his identity.

The young Hidden Official had instructed Wei Wenlong to pass a letter to Wei Ban, mentioning that if Mi Yu ultimately chose to stay at Luopo Mountain, he should find the three disciples in Yanzhi County and return with them. When the time came, Mi Yu would accompany the three to Beijulu Continent, have Zhao Shuxia practice martial arts with Senior Li Er at Lion Peak, send Zhao Luan to the Colorful Sparrow Mansion, and allow Mr. Wu to visit Cloud City. During this time, Mi Yu could decide whether to help guide Zhao Shuxia, who had already received the sword energy's teachings.

Mi Yu was more than willing to do these things. It felt like returning to the Summer Palace or the Spring Fan Hall.

Otherwise, while life at Luopo Mountain was comfortable and enjoyable, there was still a lingering emptiness.

After sending the three disciples onto a ferry, Mi Yu sought out Liu Chongrun before heading to the celestial ferry near Fengxue Temple.

Unexpectedly, upon arrival at the appointed time, the ladies from Changchun Palace had not yet appeared. After waiting for a while, he finally took to the wind, using the cultivation of a Sea Observation realm practitioner to fly towards the mountain gate of Fengxue Temple.

He soon encountered them as they were just leaving the temple gate, the old woman looking rather gloomy.

Their most important task on this trip was to procure a small piece of ten-thousand-year pine from the deity platform of Fengxue Temple. This was urgently needed by the wife of a powerful incense patron, now a high-ranking Dali patrol envoy, a position newly established after the iron cavalry moved south, seen as an exclusive rank for military generals. Only four such positions exist in all of Dali, including Cao Ping and Su Gaoshan. The patron's wife needed the pine to heal an ailment, and the celestial masters on the mountain had stated that only with a piece of the ten-thousand-year pine from the deity platform could she be cured; otherwise, they would need to seek a fifth realm deity from a pharmacy.

Unfortunately, the general had a very good relationship with Zhenwu Mountain, but was at odds with Fengxue Temple. Thus, he entrusted this matter to Changchun Palace. If successful, he would reward them handsomely, forging a lasting bond of incense; if unsuccessful, it would be up to Changchun Palace to figure it out.

The Dali dynasty, or rather, the entirety of Baoping Continent, was already far removed from its former self.

Meanwhile, the ten-thousand-year pine called "Longqing" at Fengxue Temple grew on the edge of the deity platform, its branches high above the mountain ridge, while its roots extended down to the valley bottom, absorbing the water's essence. Thus, it had extraordinary medicinal properties, with thick bark over an inch, and once peeled, it resembled amber, known for its miraculous effects in medicine. Especially for women, whether the influential women at the foot of the mountain or the female celestial masters who had slain the red dragon, everyone sought it, yet no one could obtain it. The reason was simple: the ten-thousand-year pine was situated on the deity platform, and any matters regarding the deity platform had to be discussed with Sword Immortal Wei. Even the patriarchs of Fengxue Temple would find it embarrassing to request a piece of the pine from Wei.

The elder of Changchun Palace had connections with the Qin clan of Dali, otherwise, one would have no hope of securing this request. It was clearly not something that could be resolved with mere offerings to the deities, and the old woman initially thought it would be challenging, at least leaving room for maneuver. However, upon arriving at Fengxue Temple’s Dali River, the Qin patriarch immediately changed his demeanor, firmly stating that this matter was absolutely impossible and advising the old woman not to harbor any delusions.

After meeting with the ladies from Changchun Palace, Mi Yu merely said he would try his luck at Fengxue Temple.

Of course, he wasn't doing it for Changchun Palace; he just thought that since the ten-thousand-year pine was so valuable, as a member of Luopo Mountain, he would feel ashamed if he didn't take a good piece home.

After all, when he passed by that ten-thousand-year pine with Wei Jin, the sword immortal had mentioned that if it grew on Wenqing Peak or at the Green Water Pool, it would save him a lot of trouble.

When Mi Yu arrived familiar with the deity platform, he began to snap off branches, breaking off one and declaring that good things come in pairs. He snapped off another and said the three talents were all gathered. As he chanted about the four symbols converging, a woman suddenly arrived, rushing in on the wind. They were acquaintances—she had just returned to her sect not long ago. 

With a single strike of her sword energy, she slashed beside Mi Yu, but unexpectedly, he, the self-proclaimed wild cultivator, seemed to have a guilty conscience and crashed right into the blade, plummeting into the abyss. By the time she attempted to go back and rescue him, she found no trace.

The woman scoured the cliffs and valleys multiple times but still could not find the inexplicably vanished figure. Returning to the ten-thousand-year pine, she found the ancestors of Fengxue Temple—the patriarchs of Dali River and Wenqing Peak—gathered at the summit. Her mentor smiled and said she need not concern herself with this person.

The woman couldn’t help but ask if he truly knew Master Wei.

The Dali River patriarch smiled, “There’s potential there.”

The Wenqing Peak elder snorted coldly.

The youthful-looking patriarch of Fengxue Temple floated in the air, communicating with the other two elders, "This person is undoubtedly connected to the sword immortal."

After Mi Yu stealthily left Fengxue Temple, he claimed to lack face but, before reaching the shores of Niujiao Mountain while riding a ferry, secretly handed a piece of ten-thousand-year pine to Han Biya, stating he had found it on the way and it cost him nothing, possibly even the precious pine.

The young girl questioned, "Are you trying to fool me?"

However, the ancient pine in her hands felt remarkably heavy.

Mi Yu smiled, “Is it me trying to trick you, or is it the ten-thousand-year pine tricking you?”

The girl liked to talk but not to smile, as she felt her small tiger teeth made her look unflattering.

As she watched his carefree departing silhouette, she couldn’t help but smile secretly.

On the banks of the unfinished Du River in the central part of Baoping Continent, a white-clothed youth rode on a child’s back while Lin Shouyi hurried to catch up from the Book Lake.

Cui Dongshan jumped down, taking the twenty-four bamboo slips from Lin Shouyi, glancing around, murmuring, "Thank you for your hard work."

Before this, several "齐" characters had already been secured.

And a letter of dissolution had arrived from the Sword Qi Great Wall to Baoping Continent.

Cui Dongshan raised his voice, exclaiming, "Thank you for your hard work!"

He had once joked about the reunion of Liu Qingfeng and Li Baozhen, saying it was a difficult reunion in the Jianghu, after all, it was a world of rivers and lakes.

Now, even if the entire Haoran world were considered a Jianghu, where was the teacher? 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 808: A Young Man's Little Story

In the capital of the Great泉 Dynasty, after a heavy snowfall, Shinjing City (蜃景城) revealed a beauty rarely seen in the world. Shinjing was adorned with magnificent architecture, and temples and Daoist shrines were scattered throughout, making the true beauty of the city not during the snowfall, but when the snow melted. To truly appreciate the scenery, one must ascend to a high vantage point to overlook the city, which resembled a colorful glass fairyland, with flowing clouds and vibrant hues, clear and flawless.

At the moment when the snow was melting, Jiang Shangzhen (薑尚真) and Madam Huan Sha (浣紗夫人) entered this earthly paradise. However, beautiful sights, like stunning women, seemed to withstand only fleeting glances. As soon as Jiang Shangzhen stepped into the city, he lost interest, and the lady had her worries, leaving her with little appreciation for the landscape.

Jiang Shangzhen had procured a travel permit, of course, under the name Zhou Fei (周肥). This was indeed a name of great fortune; he wished he could change his name in the records of the Yuguizong to Zhou Fei. Unfortunately, as the sect leader, he faced the disapproval of Xun Laozu (荀老儿), who was like a grand elder to him. The old man clearly had no understanding of the principle that a seasoned horse should not cling to an old stable; he truly was a nuisance.

Madam Huan Sha, who was associated with Jiu Niang (九娘), did not have such troubles. She already had the identity of a border army's descendant from the Yao family. Her father, Yao Zhen, had once been a general who laid down his arms to take up an official position in the capital, eventually becoming the Minister of War in the Great泉 Dynasty. It was said that in the past two years, his health had deteriorated, and he had participated very little in morning courts or night duties. The young emperor had even invited several deities to the Zhongyue Mountain's Jun Mansion and the Biyou Palace to help with blessings. The old minister enjoyed such special treatment not only because he was the backbone of the Great泉 army but also because his granddaughter, Yao Jinzhi, was now the empress of the Great泉.

After entering the city, Jiang Shangzhen, dressed in Confucian robes and carrying a book box, poked the ground with his green bamboo walking stick, akin to a country bumpkin visiting the capital for the first time. He smiled and asked, “Jiu Niang, will you go directly to the palace to visit the empress, or will you first return to the Yao residence to greet your father and see your daughter? If it’s the latter, please be cautious of the idle youths wandering the streets.”

Madam Huan Sha was known as Jiu Niang, but Jiu Niang was not merely Madam Huan Sha. When Xun Yuan (荀淵) exclaimed "strange," he had unwittingly severed a connection that had long since fused with Yao Jinzhi’s soul, protecting this fateful younger generation. Moreover, it was a firm stance by Madam Huan Sha for the Dafu Academy to witness, severing the last tether of her own Dao path, from an immortal’s descent to a jade pendant. Should the world descend into chaos in the future, she would similarly distance herself, offering no assistance.

With her face concealed beneath a veil, she softly asked, “How long can Sect Leader Jiang stay in the capital?”

Jiang Shangzhen replied, “To reminisce about the past, drink some wine, visit that temple, and experience the forty farts of Niushan on the walls. I’d like to stroll through that Daoist temple, see if I can run into the Lady of Caozhou, who was banished from the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land, and also check what Xun Laozu is up to. It seems he has a lot on his plate. Would a ten-day period suffice for you, Jiu Niang?”

Madam Huan Sha offered a respectful bow, “Thank you, Sect Leader Jiang.”

The two parted ways, with Jiu Niang seemingly heading to the Yao residence for a family visit. In truth, Yao Zhen was still in good health; it was just that the Yao family had been thriving too much in recent years. With many disciples from the border army, they had formed a tight network in the official circles, spreading their branches and leaves. The younger generation excelled in both civil and military pursuits within the Great泉 court. Furthermore, Yao Zhen's youngest daughter had married Li Xiling, who was a relative of Yao Zhen. Though Li Xiling’s father had been the Minister of Personnel, he had long since resigned to avoid suspicion, but he had once been a respected figure among the literati and an influential teacher to the successor of the Ministry of Personnel, which created a close connection between the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of War due to Yao Zhen's ascension to power. Even if Yao Zhen wished to change this somewhat taboo arrangement, he lacked the strength to do so.

Old Minister Yao’s grandson, Yao Xianzhi, had become the youngest scout captain in the history of the Great泉 border army. Thanks to numerous evaluations by the Ministry of Personnel and military selections, Yao Xianzhi had received praise, and with his outstanding military achievements, the emperor held a fondness for this little brother-in-law. Consequently, even if Yao Zhen wanted Yao Xianzhi to take things slow in his career, he could not force it.

As for Yao Lingzhi, the only daughter of Jiu Niang, she had practiced martial arts since childhood and had remarkable talent. She was somewhat of an exception, often traveling outside the capital for two or three years at a time, showing little interest in marriage. The young noblemen in the capital, adorned in fine clothes and riding spirited horses, were wary of this fierce and powerful young woman, often avoiding her path when they saw her.

Jiang Shangzhen watched the graceful figure walking away and smiled, “This is just like sending one’s wife back to her family for a visit.”

After some difficulty asking for directions, Jiang Shangzhen finally found a little-known martial arts school, established over a decade ago. The school’s master, Liu Zong, was of second or third-tier skill in the bustling martial arts scene of the capital. Whenever there was a gathering of peers to discuss whether a certain foreign pugilist could establish a school, Liu Zong could only sit at the end of the table. Afterward, whenever they sparred, Liu Zong often took the lead, knowing he would lose, as a form of face-saving for the outsiders.

As time passed, the martial arts community in the capital came to refer to him as “Liu Zong, the master who always loses in sparring.” If it weren't for this reputation, Jiang Shangzhen doubted he could have found the school through mere inquiries.

Two men were shoveling snow in front of the school—one was a sturdy young man, and the other a thin teenager. The young man ignored Jiang Shangzhen when he saw him, but the teenager, still concerned about the school’s business, looked curiously at the scholar-like figure and asked, “Are you here to learn martial arts at our school, sir?”

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled, “I have no acquaintances in the city. Luckily, I have an old acquaintance in Liu Zong, so I just came to enjoy a warm cup of tea.”

The teenager laughed heartily, revealing a sincere nature, and led Jiang Shangzhen inside. The small martial arts school had its advantages; there were no complicated grievances or feuds. The martial artists from outside the capital were not keen on displaying their skills in their own school, as winning wouldn’t earn them any bragging rights, and with the old master’s good temperament, there wouldn’t be enemies coming to the door.

A robust man, who had been listlessly shoveling snow, suddenly noticed two nearby women passing by and shouted. He puffed out his chest, squatted slightly, and began spinning around, causing a flurry of snowflakes to fly everywhere. The two women were embarrassed and muttered some curses before hastily departing.

In the commotion, Jiang Shangzhen jumped aside to avoid the broom, but the slippery ground caused him to lose his balance and fall. The man burst into laughter, too lazy to apologize and instead mocked the scholar for being weak on his feet. “What’s this? Is your wife being taken away by a wild man, and you’re too furious to retaliate, so now you want to learn martial arts?”

The teenager was a bit anxious, having heard that scholars valued their reputation, especially since this was a guest of the master. He couldn't allow such casual humiliation. If this man turned out to be a scholar of some renown or a candidate for the imperial examination, the matter could escalate to the government, and the school would have to bear the consequences.

Fortunately, Jiang Shangzhen seemed used to being treated as a soft target and smiled, “I’m not here to learn martial arts; I can’t handle the hardships.”

This commotion drew the attention of the two women, who turned back, giggling behind their hands. Where did this bookish fellow come from? Even if he was handsome, who would dare to steal another's man?

Led by the teenager, Jiang Shangzhen was taken to the backyard of the school.

Master Liu Zong was practicing his stances, gradually throwing punches. The old man was born with an unfortunate appearance, with sparse hair and a crooked face, giving off an impression of being coarse and unsophisticated. Regardless of his martial skills, he lacked the demeanor of a true master.

However, years ago, at the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Liu Zong had fought alongside the national master of the Southern Garden Kingdom, Zhong Qiu, and the exiled immortal Chen Ping'an, forming bonds of friendship. Liu Zong had even faced off against Yu Zhenyi, who had already cultivated to become an immortal.

To say he couldn’t defeat them was an understatement.

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, “Old Brother Liu, do you still remember your fellow townsman Zhou Fei?”

As soon as he heard the name, the old man stopped his punches, dismissed the young disciple, and sat on the steps. “In recent years, I’ve inquired a lot. I haven’t heard of anyone named Zhou Fei or Chen Ping'an in Tongye Prefecture. However, I have heard of the Sword Immortal Lu Fang. Of course, I’ve gathered most of my knowledge through hearsay and by reading the travel reports from several immortal inns.”

Jiang Shangzhen looked around and asked, “Since we’re all stuck at the bottleneck of the Golden Body Realm, why do you still hide here? The heroic spirit of the blade sharpeners from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land has been worn down by the immortal aura of the Great Qi world, hasn’t it?”

Liu Zong scoffed, “What do you expect? In your hometown, those mountain deities can move mountains and seas and manipulate clouds and rain. Especially those sword immortals! As a mere martial artist in the Golden Body Realm, I would be trampled upon if I encountered one. Would it be worth trading my life for some empty fame?”

Jiang Shangzhen took off his book box and sat down, saying, “The Great泉 Dynasty has always valued martial prowess. You could align yourself with Liu of the Great泉 and devote yourself to the military path, honing your martial skills. Wouldn’t that be a win-win? As long as you succeed in entering the Wandering Realm, even the emperor of Great泉 would treat you with respect. When the time comes, you could leave the border and become a behind-the-scenes advisor to someone like Li Li, living a peaceful life. After all, Li Li died ‘from illness’ back in the day, and the capital is short on capable experts.”

Liu Zong shook his head, “You can’t be a miserable person without a choice. According to your reasoning, I could have easily found an emperor to align with back in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Though my life is a bit tough now, it’s quite free. I’ve never slacked in my martial training, and my path to the Wandering Realm will come in due time.”

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “No wonder you’ve earned some respect from Chen Ping'an.”

Liu Zong asked with a smile, “That little sword immortal is from another continent, right? Otherwise, in this Tongye Prefecture, he wouldn’t have such a reputation. How is he doing now?”

Jiang Shangzhen thought for a moment, “It’s hard to say.”

As for this blade sharpener, he certainly didn’t speak the truth, and it could be said he was almost entirely bluffing. Otherwise, Jiang Shangzhen wouldn’t have found Liu Zong’s name among the complex intelligence reports from the Yuguizong. In reality, after Liu Zong left the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he had not been idle; he had often made a name for himself, battling against Qi cultivators. Now, not only was he an unnamed worshipper at the Golden Peak Temple, but he was also one of the dragon-holding men personally selected by the late emperor Liu Zhen. To ensure the new emperor’s smooth ascension, he had even placed the eldest prince Liu Cong, who held military power in the north, under house arrest in the capital for “health reasons.” Liu Zong was effectively the bodyguard of the prince, making him a trusted confidant of the current emperor.

Jiang Shangzhen could understand the self-preservation tactics of an old practitioner; after all, Zhou Fei's reputation in the martial world of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land was not particularly favorable.

Earlier chatter had merely been Jiang Shangzhen’s way of relieving his boredom, intentionally teasing Liu Zong. 

For example, Chen Ping'an once had a conflict with the Third Prince Liu Mao at Jiu Niang’s inn in Hu’er Town, where he not only killed the son of Duke Gao of the Shun Kingdom but also personally executed Wei Li, the head of the Imperial Horse Supervisory Bureau. Both princes of the Great泉 had been sworn enemies of his, and Chen Ping'an had a very close relationship with the Yao family. It could be said that the Shun Duke’s house lost its hereditary position, Liu Cong was placed under house arrest, and the exposure of the Third Prince Liu Mao and the scholar Wang Qi’s secrets had all contributed to the current emperor’s rise. Liu Zong, given his status, naturally would have heard of these court secrets, if not entirely understood them.

While Liu Zong rambled on, Jiang Shangzhen simply listened.

Liu Zong was oblivious to the fact that Zhou Fei was actually the one in charge of the entire Tongye Prefecture.

Even if he had heard that the Sword Immortal Lu Fang had a friend named Jiang Shangzhen, Liu Zong would never have imagined that a master of the Cloud Cave Blessed Land, an immortal at the peak of the Fifth Realm, would willingly waste decades of his life as the master of a temple, rolling in the mud for fun. After all, having “ascended” from the Blessed Land to the Great Qi world many years ago, Liu Zong was not entirely unfamiliar with the scenery of this world. The cultivators here were no different from Yu Zhenyi in their detached demeanor, even having encountered many earthly immortals who were far less earnest in seeking the Dao than Yu Zhenyi.

Liu Zong sighed, “This world is indeed full of wonders. I remember when I first arrived here, witnessing the Water God ferrying boats, the city god conducting night trials, and the fox spirits haunting people. How could one imagine such things back in my hometown? No wonder those exiled immortals see us as frogs at the bottom of a well.”

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled, “These supernatural occurrences become mundane after seeing them often. What’s more interesting is the day the rafter is born, the beam breaker appears, and the stubborn ones linger for a few more years.”

Liu Zong didn’t want to beat around the bush with Jiang Shangzhen and asked straightforwardly, “Zhou Fei, what do you want from me this time? Are you here to recruit help or to settle old scores? If I remember correctly, while you were frolicking among the flowers in the Blessed Land, I was guarding a shabby shop. We don’t have any grudges. If you’re here today just to reminisce, I’ll treat you to some drinks.”

Jiang Shangzhen replied, “Let’s skip the drinking; I only enjoy fine wine. How much can your little martial arts school earn? Rest assured, I’m not here for you. I’m traveling to Shinjing City with friends, and on a whim, I heard of the renowned Liu Zong, so I wanted to try my luck. I didn’t expect to actually find you. It seems my luck is quite good right now. Tonight, I plan to visit the Lady of Caozhou and see if I can catch a glimpse of her beauty. Old Brother Liu, would you care to join me on this night tour? With your esteemed presence, I’ll have a better chance of winning her favor.”

Liu Zong stroked his beard and laughed, “Zhou, you still have your charm.”

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, “Look at my scholarly attire; it's clear I'm here prepared.”

Liu Zong asked with a grin, “Are you really just a passerby?”

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “So please, Old Brother Liu, put away that bone knife of yours. Treating guests this way is quite frightful.”

As they neared the Central Lands, Liu Chicheng (柳赤誠) had been unusually silent. After passing the Xielong Stone, he looked half-dead. Inside, Chai Bofu (柴伯符) admired Liu Chicheng immensely.

If Gu Can (顾璨) was a person with blessings and fortunes, Liu Chicheng was a true comrade. Back at Xielong Stone, Chai Bofu was busy collecting treasures on the mountain, showcasing his wild and unrefined nature. Unexpectedly, a large group of cultivators arrived, including both sect masters and wild practitioners, all drawn to the suddenly unsealed Xielong Stone. Chai Bofu was unafraid; Liu Chicheng had opened the seal without closing the door, allowing outsiders to be lured in by the phenomena. Even without mentioning Liu Chicheng’s Jade Pendant Realm cultivation, his name alone was enough to let the three of them walk confidently. After all, the one right next to him was Gu Can, who had just taken Liu Chicheng as his disciple.

Then, suddenly, an old fisherman wearing a bamboo hat and green raincoat appeared beside Chai Bofu, carrying a green bamboo pole with two pale golden carps hanging from it.

This was the fishing immortal Liu Chicheng had mentioned, the only fisherman of the Luoshui Pit, a solitary figure of the Southern Sea. There were several of them; however, the fishing immortal had always been elusive.

As Chai Bofu stood up to express his respect to this senior on his path of cultivation, he was met with a single glance from the old fisherman, instantly freezing him in place.

The old fisherman waved to the approaching Qi practitioners, signaling that this Xielong Stone was not something they could covet. 

A Jade Pendant Realm fishing immortal, standing guard over his own Xielong Stone, was a formidable deterrent.

Had the Xielong Stone not had this old fisherman in residence, merely surrounded by a few exhausted serpents returning from the rain, this group of practitioners accustomed to the sea winds could have easily raided Xielong Stone. Historically, the Luoshui Pit had not cared much about the thefts occurring at the Xielong Stone. But the appearance of the fishing immortal changed everything. Among the sea immortals, those who casually drifted like floating weeds were one thing, while the major sects that firmly held their ground had all witnessed, or even experienced, the might of the Southern Sea’s solitary figures.

Thus, after weighing the pros and cons, the sect masters all bowed and took their leave from the old fisherman. The remaining wild practitioners glanced longingly at the precious dragon saliva flowing into the sea, reluctant to leave.

The fishing immortal pointed at one individual, and the dragon saliva quickly gathered, surging up and enveloping the closest wild practitioner, suffocating him instantly, his body dissolving.

Liu Chicheng’s thoughts were not on the fishing immortal; the sect masters had left, and the wild practitioners fled in trepidation, leaving only two women still suspended in the air.

One was a seemingly delicate young lady, not the type to make one fall head over heels at first sight, but rather someone who was pleasant to look at. Beside her was a small fox spirit with mismatched eyes, at the Golden Core Realm. Compared to his own brother Long Bo, she was indeed a notch above.

Gu Can remained silent throughout.

The old fisherman, for some unknown reason, was also quiet, his expression shifting.

Liu Chicheng couldn’t help but inquire, “If these two young ladies can be trusted, feel free to climb the mountain and gather treasures.”

Then Liu Chicheng turned to the stunning fox spirit and smiled slightly. The fox spirit blinked, and then hid behind the young lady.

The young lady was not polite at all; she brought her little fox spirit with her onto Xielong Stone.

She instructed the fox spirit to stay put and ascended the mountain alone.

Liu Chicheng approached the little fox spirit and asked, “May I ask your name and where you are from? I am Liu Chicheng, a scholar from the Baoping Prefecture, and my hometown is very close to the Guanhua Academy.”

The young lady took a few steps back, timidly replying, “My name is Wei Taizhen, and I come from the Northern Julu Prefecture.”

This “scholar” dressed in green was rather strange.

Liu Chicheng showed surprise, his expression filled with sympathy as he spoke softly, “You’ve come from such a far place, Wei sister. It must be tiring. This journey to Xielong Stone must yield great rewards. The dragon pearls found here are of high quality, perfect for making a celestial dress. Once worn by you, it would be a match made in heaven. If you could also create a ‘pearl on palm’ bracelet, wouldn’t people mistake you for a celestial being?”

Wei Taizhen neither blushed nor got angry, simply saying, “If you keep this up, my master will be upset.”

Liu Chicheng pointed to the ground, noting they were still several steps apart. He smiled, “I have only expressed my admiration for Wei sister; surely, that won’t anger your esteemed master.”

Wei Taizhen replied, “I have already been sent as a maid to my master; please do not speak frivolously. Besides, whether my master gets angry or not, it is not something you can determine.”

Liu Chicheng raised his sleeve, covering his mouth as he laughed, “Wei sister is indeed adorable.”

Wei Taizhen warned, “If you continue this way, I will have to be unkind to you.”

Liu Chicheng lowered his sleeve, smiling cheerfully, “Why would Wei sister be so polite with Liu brother?”

Chai Bofu sat by the fishing immortal, feeling bored, and thought to himself how Liu Chicheng had never changed his nature. Even during their travels through the Baoping Prefecture, whenever he encountered a beautiful woman, whether she was a mountain cultivator or a market girl, he would always approach and banter a few words. The key was that Liu Chicheng was all talk and no action; what was he truly after?

At the peak of Xielong Stone, Gu Can finally smiled and said, “Long time no see.”

Li Liu (李柳) nodded and replied, “I’m well enough.”

Gu Can nodded again, unable to suppress a laugh, as memories of childhood flooded back.

Back then, besides being Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyong’s shadow, he also enjoyed wandering around on his own. When faced with older and stronger troublemakers, he could only run far away and hurl insults. However, in the dilapidated house at the western edge of the small town, there was a peer named Li Huai, one of the few people Gu Can could bully. Li Huai could not match Gu Can in insults or fighting, and he wasn’t the type to complain to his family, so Gu Can often played with him. One snowy day when no one was around, while stuffing snowballs into Li Huai’s collar, he was caught by Li Huai’s sister. As a result, Gu Can found himself hoisted up by the seemingly frail Li Liu, his head facing the ground, and was used as a broom to clear the snow from their doorstep. Gu Can, feeling dizzy, scrambled to his feet and fled, cursing Li Liu as he went, saying he would call Chen Ping'an to bully her next time, and that he would make Chen Ping'an ride her until she couldn’t take it anymore. 

Gu Can then asked, “I heard you went to the Northern Julu Prefecture?”

Li Liu replied with a simple “Mm.”

She was looking at Liu Chicheng at the foot of Xielong Stone.

Gu Can then relayed through thought, “Be careful of that little brother of the Baidi City Lord. Though Liu Chicheng may have a sharp tongue, he wouldn’t truly act against you.”

Li Liu glanced at Gu Can and remarked, “You’ve changed quite a bit.”

Gu Can smiled, “Well, not too much.”

Then, he suddenly felt a jolt and instinctively soared several feet into the air.

Li Liu had stomped her foot, and the entire Xielong Stone shattered in an instant.

It didn’t slowly sink into the sea; rather, the mountain was broken apart in an instant, and in that moment, the Great Qi world lost this Xielong Stone belonging to the Luoshui Pit.

Wei Taizhen swayed, quickly hovering in the air.

The fisher immortal stationed in Luoshui Pit said nothing.

Chai Bofu nearly jumped out of his skin.

Liu Chicheng turned his head, staring at the young lady.

Li Liu asked, “Do you want to die?”

Liu Chicheng protested, “My master is not far from here!”

Li Liu inquired, “Oh? Should I call Zheng Juzhong to come for you?”

Zheng Juzhong (郑居中), the Lord of Baidi City, had the title of Huai Xian.

In the Great Qi world, how many dared to call this devilish figure by his name?

Liu Chicheng immediately shook his head, “No need, no need. I have things to attend to; I must leave now.”

He shouted for Long Bo, saying it was time for them to make a move. Chai Bofu swallowed hard, standing up cautiously and hovering away.

Gu Can and Li Liu exchanged polite farewells before departing.

After all, they were fellow townsfolk, and Gu Can felt no need to hold back from Li Liu, even after she had stomped on Xielong Stone. He felt little emotional turmoil.

Thus, at the site of the old Xielong Stone, only the old fisherman remained. After Liu Chicheng and the others left, the old fisherman knelt down, unable to rise, and trembled as he spoke, “I, an old official of Luoshui Pit, pay my respects…”

Li Liu frowned and interrupted the old fisherman, “Take all the Southern Sea solitary figures to Northern Julu Prefecture to assist Shen Lin of the Southern Xu Water Palace. She will be the new Lingyuan Gong, but her cultivation is insufficient.”

The old fisherman still did not dare to stand, calling out loudly, “I shall carry out the order!”

Li Liu reached out, and the shattered Xielong Stone coalesced into a bead, which she tucked into her sleeve.

After the old fisherman disappeared, Wei Taizhen approached Li Liu and softly asked, “Master?”

Li Liu replied, “Let’s head to Luoshui Pit; Zheng Juzhong is already there.”

However, as Li Liu soared towards Luoshui Pit, she remained calm and suddenly smiled, “We should return early; my brother should have arrived in the Northern Julu Prefecture by now.”

Wei Taizhen nodded slightly.

With that, Li Liu grabbed the little fox spirit’s shoulder and instantly transported herself to Luoshui Pit.

Luoshui Pit resembled a palace, with exquisite towers and countless halls.

The Lord of Baidi City stood at the top of the main hall’s stairs, accompanied by a plump woman in palace attire. Upon seeing Li Liu, she softly asked, “My Lord, is this person…?”

The man smiled, “You shouldn’t have refined this Luoshui Pit as your life-bound object.”

As Li Liu ascended, the palace woman’s face flushed, and her knees bent slightly. By the time Li Liu reached the middle of the stairs, the woman’s knees were almost touching the ground. When Li Liu reached the top of the stairs, the woman was already prostrated on the ground.

The man displayed no surprise; after all, bearing the weight of all the seawater within a radius of ten thousand miles with just a Luoshui Pit would be taxing even for a person at the Ascended Realm. Otherwise, this young lady, given her current cultivation level, wouldn’t be able to manage.

Li Liu stepped on the head of that Ascended Realm demon and said to the man, “We meet again.”

The Lord of Baidi City smiled, “Are you truly determined to make this your life’s path?”

Li Liu gazed into the distance while still standing on the head of the Ascended Realm demon, nodding, “Everything must come to an end.”

Under the clear sky, with the sun hanging high, a young boy in green attire and a black-clad youth soared together on the winds, observing the land below. They were in a small vassal kingdom of the Great源 Dynasty, suffering from a severe drought, with no rain for months. The trees had shed their bark, and the refugees dispersed to other countries. However, how far could the common folk flee from their homes? Many died from starvation along the way, leaving bones scattered across the fields.

The black-clad youth asked curiously, “You returned only to show me this scene?”

The young boy in green, with a bamboo box strapped to his back and a bamboo staff in hand, looked somewhat dejected. “Just tell me if you can help me with this. I don’t have any treasures to carry water; I can’t bring back too much water from the Luoshui. If I frequently travel between here and Luoshui, the Water Dragon Sect will definitely stop me. Li Yuan, you are my only friend here. If you find it too difficult, I’ll just go back and transport the water myself, and you can pretend you didn’t see.”

The youth sighed, “Is this what you should be concerned about right now? My good brother, traveling the river is more important than anything. I beg you to take this to heart.”

The young boy bit his lip and said, “If I hadn’t seen those pitiful people, I wouldn’t care. But seeing them weighs heavily on my heart. If my master were here, he would definitely take action.”

This was Chen Lingjun (陈灵均), who was traveling to Luoshui, and the one he had clicked with was Li Yuan (李源), the Water God.

They had already formed a brotherhood on Fushui Island, where they had sworn an oath to be brothers.

Earlier during their travels, Chen Lingjun had distanced himself from the Luoshui waters to survey the geography, only to find that the farther he got from the Luoshui, the more tragic the situation became. Under the scorching sun, the rice and grains were scorched, and in the mountains, there was almost no greenery in sight. Rivers and wells had dried up completely, and local officials had nearly abandoned all governance, either digging wells with people or praying for rain by bowing down. Along the way, Chen Lingjun encountered a group of fleeing refugees, hiding under a withered tree to avoid the sun. Among them was a frail little girl, held in her mother’s arms, barely alive, her lips cracked and devoid of blood, only able to whimper softly.

Known for his carefree attitude in the Falling Rock Mountain, Chen Lingjun simply could not bear to see the little girl in such a state.

After rescuing the little girl, he returned to the Long Palace, asking Li Yuan to come along.

Li Yuan said seriously, “Aren’t you curious why the rulers and immortals of this kingdom still cannot control the clouds and rain? Why can’t they borrow water from Luoshui? Let me tell you, this drought is due to heavenly timing, not because of any demons or sorcery. Therefore, according to the rules, the citizens of this kingdom must endure this calamity. The ruler of that small kingdom shouldn’t have provoked the emperor of the Great源 Dynasty a few years ago. The local water deities have suffered before the commoners, and while the mountain gods fare slightly better, many water deities have already been harmed. A few river gods and water gods are barely holding on, while numerous river lords and river ladies are in a worse situation, suffering without water, enduring the flames day and night. As of now, no one dares to intervene; otherwise, a few local immortals from the Chongxuan Department could easily summon rain. The ruler of this kingdom had some ties with a disciple of the Water Dragon Sect, but he can’t even call on them now?”

The Luoshui River traversed the eastern and western ends of the Northern Julu Prefecture and once housed three major water temples. The lower temple near the Spring Dew Garden had already collapsed, while the upper temple was under the control of the Chongxuan Department’s Yang family. The central temple, while nominally under the Water Dragon Sect’s supervision, was essentially owned by the water deity, Li Yuan.

Chen Lingjun tightened his grip on his walking stick, speaking solemnly, “I won’t concern myself with such matters. If I fail to travel the river, my master will at most scold me a few times. But if I turn a blind eye to this suffering, even if I succeed in my journey, I’d still have no face to return home.”

Chen Lingjun began to mutter, seemingly bolstering his courage. “If my master finds out about this, I won’t have the face to stay. I know my master’s temper all too well. If this matter angers the Great源 Dynasty and the Chongxuan Department, I can always return to Falling Rock Mountain and get scolded by my master.”

Li Yuan questioned, “Chen Ping'an has meticulously planned for you to travel the river; are you just going to give it all up and return home?”

Chen Lingjun laughed, “Maybe he’ll even praise me a bit.”

Li Yuan’s expression grew serious as he said, “Brother, don’t blame me for pouring cold water on you. Let me share some historical events with you. Be sure to think thoroughly before making a decision. The ancient true dragons have countless bloody lessons to learn from regarding rainmaking. One misstep could lead to imprisonment on the Dragon Slaying Platform, facing light punishments like being skinned or heavier ones like losing claws. Your essence might face unbearable torment for a hundred or a thousand years before being demoted to a minor river deity among humans. Some poor souls have even had their heads chopped off and tossed into the water. This kingdom’s drought isn’t a man-made disaster; it’s a calamity imposed by heaven. Since you lack local divine status, any interference would heavily entangle you in karma. Even if the Chongxuan Department turns a blind eye, it will greatly impact your future travels, leading to even heavier heavenly tribulations. Just think, before transforming into a dragon, how could you, as a mere small water creature, dare to alter fate? Wouldn’t that just lead to you being even more reckless? Heaven wouldn’t punish anyone else but you!”

Chen Lingjun replied weakly, “Stop trying to dissuade me; I’m already scared out of my wits. You’re not being a good brother by scaring me like this when you know I won’t change my mind.”

Li Yuan sighed, “Fine, fine, a brother who only shares good times isn’t a true brother. Let’s go. I, the future Duke of Longting, will take you to meet the future Lingyuan Gong! If she agrees, even if the Chongxuan Department’s immortals resent it, the issue won’t be too serious. As for the Water Dragon Sect, both Sun Jie and Shao Jingzhi, I, this little Water Deity, should be able to handle them.”

Chen Lingjun was overjoyed and asked curiously, “The future Lingyuan Gong? Who is she? Should I prepare a gift for our meeting?”

If he could pull this off, even giving up a dragon king’s net would be worth it!

Li Yuan grinned, “She’s the one you praised to the skies, Sister Shen Lin from the Southern Xu Water Palace.”

Of course, when he said “praised to the skies,” it was just a casual remark. Chen Lingjun genuinely thought Shen Lin was beautiful.

Chen Lingjun, in disbelief, looked down at the earth, “You’re not joking, right? If this goes back and forth…”

He fell silent for a moment and then continued, “That might lead to many deaths.”

Li Yuan’s expression turned grave as he said, “If you’ve made up your mind, then let’s unite as brothers. I’ll lend you a jade token that can hold the waters of a regular river deity’s jurisdiction. Just take it and head to Luoshui to collect water. I’ll go directly to the Southern Xu Water Palace to request a decree from Sister Shen Lin. She’s about to be promoted as the Lingyuan Gong, and it’s a sure thing. The Academy and the Great源 Chongxuan Department have already caught wind of this, so it’s understood. Only I, the Duke of Longting, still have some uncertainties; for now, I can only play the role of a mere visitor at the Water Dragon Sect’s ancestral hall.”

Li Yuan handed Chen Lingjun a token engraved with “Three Feet of Sweet Rain” and then soared away, returning to the Long Palace.

Chen Lingjun held the jade token and made his way to a secluded spot by the Luoshui River, secretly leaping into the water and beginning to use his life’s water technique to quietly collect the river water into the jade token.

Li Yuan first visited the ancestral hall of the Water Dragon Sect, informing them that he would personally transport water for rain. The Water Dragon Sect and the Chongxuan Department responded directly with approval, and the sect master, Sun Jie, nodded with a smile.

Li Yuan widened his eyes in disbelief, “You really said that? Aren’t you afraid I’ll be hunted down and killed by Elder Yang?”

Sun Jie laughed, “Even the Chongxuan Department’s Yunjiao Palace wouldn’t dare act so recklessly.”

Li Yuan rubbed his chin and mused, “That’s true; I’m good friends with the Fire Dragon Immortal. What’s a little Chongxuan Department to me? If they dare to kill me, I’ll just go to the Daping Peak and cry to the Fire Dragon Immortal.”

Li Yuan hurriedly made his way to the Southern Xu Water Palace, visiting the soon-to-be superior, the Water Goddess Shen Lin, and asking for her favor. Feeling somewhat shy, he didn’t expect that Shen Lin would directly issue a decree, sealing it with the “Lingyuan Gong” stamp and asking if he needed help transporting water.

Holding the decree scroll, Li Yuan was astonished, “Sister Shen Lin, you’re about to be promoted to Lingyuan Gong, aren’t you worried about complications that could sour your relationship with the Great源 Dynasty and the Chongxuan Department?”

Chen Lingjun’s brother, with a heart bigger than the sky, heard that the Water Goddess was an old acquaintance of his master. Coupled with Li Yuan’s not-so-subtle hints, such as winking and saying “you know what I mean,” he thought that the Water Goddess’s demeanor and poise were truly exceptional. Li Yuan extended both thumbs, lightly touching, and so Chen Lingjun believed him, clutching Li Yuan’s shoulder as he said, “I get it, I get it. Let’s go see what my master’s little lady looks like!”

Upon arriving at the Southern Xu Water Palace, Chen Lingjun didn’t treat himself like an outsider at all. At that time, he was unaware that Shen Lin would inevitably become the Lingyuan Gong, so he interacted with the Water Goddess quite casually. Logically, since Shen Lin was a virtuous woman, her impression of Chen Lingjun, who was from another continent and had not established any connection, wouldn’t be too good, but it also wouldn’t be terrible.

If Chen Lingjun wasn’t a young boy in green, the Southern Xu Water Palace would likely not have opened its doors to him in the future. At that time, Li Yuan thought it was fine; after all, he was at the Long Palace, and his brother Chen Lingjun didn’t need to worry about whether Shen Lin liked him or not.

Now, Shen Lin smiled and asked, “Isn’t it the Great源 Dynasty and Chongxuan Department who should be worried about souring relations with me?”

Li Yuan gave her a thumbs-up, “Women can be just as formidable as men! That’s a remarkable statement!”

When Li Yuan left the Long Palace, Chen Lingjun had already revealed his true self, clutching the jade token and beginning to summon clouds and rain.

Suddenly, ominous clouds gathered over the vast mountains and rivers, and then torrential rain fell unexpectedly.

Many local Qi practitioners who rushed over upon witnessing this phenomenon bowed in gratitude to the azure serpent that emerged from the clouds.

Li Yuan noticed that Chen Lingjun seemed unfamiliar with the art of summoning rain, and so he lent a hand to help organize the rainclouds.

An hour later, Li Yuan, sitting on a cloud, saw Chen Lingjun return to his human form, falling beside him, exhausted yet still expressing his thanks.

After a long silence, Li Yuan gazed at the revitalized land below, clapping his hands and laughing, “In times of severe drought, when the grass turns yellow, the birds suffer from the heat, and fish turn into locusts. The water temple emits smoke, and the little dragon writhes, carrying the azure sky and cleansing the red earth for thousands of miles…”

Chen Lingjun had already sat up, staring at the land, lost in thought.

He had always been such a person, one who loved to boast and act tough, and he had never been careful about his actions. Thus, achieving the task of summoning rain made him naturally happy, without a hint of regret. However, the thought of traveling the river in the future and potentially facing obstacles from the Great源 Dynasty or increasing tribulations at Spring Dew Garden, which could hinder his journey, left him worried about how to face Zhu Lian and how to boast to Pei Qian, Nuan Shu, and Mi Li later. Just as Zhu Lian once said, he almost labeled every place he had been to for eating and using the restroom. If he failed to travel the river and transform into a dragon, he, Chen Lingjun, could just drown himself in the river.

Thus, Chen Lingjun harbored only one thought: if that kind-hearted master of his returned home before he returned to Falling Rock Mountain, it would be great.

Having his master at Falling Rock Mountain would indeed provide some sense of security. If he made a mistake, at most he would receive a few scolding words, but if he succeeded, he could also see the smiling face of his young master.

Moreover, Chen Lingjun still remembered his master’s wealth. Given his master’s temper, there were bound to be a few serpent gallstones. He, Chen Lingjun, didn’t need serpent gallstones, but that clumsy girl Nuan Shu and the black serpent from Qizhu Mountain, along with the big python from Huanghu Mountain, all needed them. His master could be stingy, but when generous, he was even more so.

With a sudden leap, Chen Lingjun decided it was time to continue his journey.

Li Yuan reminded him, “Keep the decree from Sister Shen Lin and the jade token with you. If any obstinate officials from the Great源 Dynasty attempt to block your way, just present them. You can always return to collect water next time.”

Chen Lingjun hesitated but ultimately nodded.

There was no other choice; at this moment, Chen Lingjun was afraid that a celestial being from the Chongxuan Department would suddenly appear and slap him to death.

Chen Lingjun decided he needed to bolster his courage and spirit. Otherwise, he felt a bit weak in the knees and couldn’t move.

After pondering for a long time, he asked Li Yuan, “You don’t know my master? He’s one of the greatest martial arts masters in the world. I’ve learned some minor skills from him, and I’ll show you, so you don’t think I’m boasting.”

Li Yuan raised his hand, “No, please, I beg you. I’m afraid of hurting my eyes.”

Unexpectedly, Chen Lingjun had already begun to demonstrate, standing on one leg like a rooster, then twisting his arms backward and leaning forward, asking, “How about my great peng spreading its wings?”

Li Yuan retorted, “My eyes are blinded!”

Chen Lingjun burst into laughter, strapped his bamboo box to his back, and left gracefully.

Li Yuan sat cross-legged, not turning his head, scoffing, “Is the Chongxuan Department’s little heavenly prince arriving so soon? What’s this? Are they here to trouble my brother? If anyone dares to touch Chen Lingjun, don’t blame me for flooding the Chongxuan Department!”

A young black-clad scholar holding a folding fan stepped onto a white cloud, with a small yellow silk pouch hanging from his waist, emitting bright light.

This person sat beside Li Yuan, lightly tapping his palm with the folded fan, smiling, “Li Yuan, you think too much. I am Yang Mumu, a rare friend of Chen Lingjun’s through thick and thin. It’s a pity we haven’t reunited since our parting at the Ghostly Mysterious Valley; I miss my good brother.”

Li Yuan asked in confusion, “Chen Lingjun, good brother? Is that Chen Ping'an?”

The scholar appeared enlightened, “I am of the same generation as Chen Ping'an, while Li Yuan is like a sworn brother to Chen Lingjun. Ah, I suppose I unintentionally outrank you by one generation!”

Li Yuan chuckled, “As long as the little heavenly prince is happy.”

The scholar said, “Rain dragons wagging their tails between the dark clouds, bearing the azure sky while embracing the sapphire mist.”

Li Yuan grew angry, “What? Are we having a poetry duel?”

The scholar laughed, “It’s better to watch Chen Lingjun fight than to engage in a poetry duel with you.”

Dealing with Chen Ping'an would be much more interesting.

Li Yuan suddenly took delight in Yang Mumu’s misfortune, “Little heavenly prince, you’re still ranked at the bottom of the young ten despite being ten years younger than everyone else.”

The scholar nodded, “Being at the bottom is fine; there’s hope.”

The Northern Julu Prefecture recently published a report from the Qionglin Sect, listing the young ten. They also ranked the young ten from the neighboring Baoping Prefecture, but the practitioners from Northern Julu had little interest in the latter.

Qi Jinglong had become the new sect leader of the Taihui Sword Sect and was naturally not among the latest young ten. Otherwise, it would be a direct insult to the sword sect.

The Qionglin Sect was concerned that the nearby peaks would be flattened by the Taihui Sword Sect’s sword cultivators, and the Qionglin Sect was no exception.

In the report, familiar faces remained, with Lin Su still holding the first place. 

The wild cultivator Huang Xi and the martial artist Xiu Niang, old rivals who had nearly fought to the death over the Tili Mountain, still made the list.

There was also Yang Jingshan, at the bottleneck of the Wandering Realm, along with the Chongxuan Department’s little heavenly prince Yang Ningxing, and the Water Mountain Fairy Lu Sui. 

The remaining two were everyone’s favorites; the only mystery lay in the sole woman, the direct disciple of the Lion Peak, Li Liu. 

As for Xu Xuan, who had been injured by He Xiaoliang, it was not difficult for him to make the list, but the Qionglin Sect dared not include him, considering he had become the laughingstock of the entire Northern Julu Prefecture. 

In the Baoping Prefecture, aside from the young ten, there were also several candidates for the young ten, a long list that would likely bore the Northern Julu cultivators.

Names like Ma Kuxuan, the great gentleman from Guanhua Academy, the once golden boy and girl of the Shengaos Sect, Jiang Yun from the Jiang clan of Yunlin, and a young dreamer from the Zhu Ying Dynasty who received a sword relic from a celestial being, leading to a smooth breakthrough… 

The scholar shook his head with a tsk, “There’s no mention of the good brother; this report from the Qionglin Sect is truly disappointing.”

Li Yuan felt puzzled over how Chen Ping'an had provoked this little heavenly prince. With Chen Ping'an’s naïve and overly kind temperament, he wouldn’t have suffered a significant loss, right?

The scholar said, “I’m off to watch some good shows; I won’t accompany you to bask in the sun. I’ll go meet the sword immortal Wei.”

Li Yuan asked, “What does the Chongxuan Department mean by this?”

The scholar replied, “I’m Yang Mumu; how would I know what the Chongxuan Department is thinking?”

Li Yuan snapped, “Are you being shameless? What a fine little heavenly prince you are, yet you’ve turned into this!”

The scholar laughed heartily and soared away.

In truth, only two among the “young generation” could truly catch the eye of those from Northern Julu Prefecture: the young martial artist Song Changjing of the Dali and the sword immortal Wei Jin, both genuinely young, being around fifty years old. For the cultivators on the mountains, based on their current realms, they could be considered remarkably youthful.

One was an existence akin to the “Supreme Emperor” of the Song family in Dali, while the other was a bona fide sword immortal. To include them in the ranks of the young ten was indeed inappropriate.

The Qionglin Sect feared the jade pendant realm sword cultivator from Baoping Prefecture, but Wei Jin, having traveled through the Sword Qi Great Wall and stationed there for many years, was surely familiar with the Taihui Sword Sect’s sect leader Qi Jinglong and the ancestral master Huang Tong, as well as the floating sword lake Li Cai. Such connections couldn’t be easily formed at a drinking table.

Moreover, in the eyes of the Northern Julu cultivators, there were only two types of sword immortals in the world: those who had traversed the Sword Qi Great Wall and those who hadn’t.

Even the first sword immortal in the north, Bai Chang, would privately be mocked by the Northern Julu practitioners.

Therefore, regarding the sword immortal Wei Jin, even the Qionglin Sect, which had no connection to him, would still hold him in some regard.

As for how Wei Jin reciprocated that respect, it was indeed very much in line with Northern Julu practices.

Cross-continental sword challenges were led by the heavenly king Xie Shi.

A girl quietly landed in the northern part of Tongye Prefecture, finding a foreign sword immortal who was cultivating by a riverside at Tongye Sect.

Now, all the sects in Northern Julu, including Yuguizong, Fuyi Sect, and Taiping Mountain, were busy with construction, and the Tongye Sect was no exception.

Upon meeting the sword immortal, she introduced herself as Chang Ming, coming from prison, and she would be cultivating at Falling Rock Mountain in the future.

Zuo Yu, who had heard her describe the younger disciple, simply nodded and then said two words: “Very good.”

Chang Ming hesitated, wanting to say something but ultimately remained silent.

Zuo Yu stood by the riverside, “Once this matter is settled, I’ll go retrieve the younger disciple.”

Chang Ming’s face showed distress; it seemed she had been correctly predicted by the Hidden Official. She could only say softly, “My master has told me that if you have such an intention, I hope that you…”

Zuo Yu waved his hand, “Who is the senior and who is the junior? There’s no need for such rules.”

Chang Ming was left speechless.

Zuo Yu suddenly remembered something and took the chance to use the remaining bit of leisure time, saying, “I’ll go to Mahe and won’t see you off.”

Zuo Yu immediately soared away on his sword.

Chang Ming had no choice but to leave the Tongye Sect and head towards Baoping Prefecture.

In the night, within Shinjing City of the Great泉 Dynasty, Jiang Shangzhen was enjoying a pleasant conversation with the Lady of Caozhou. She marveled at the moonlight while Jiang Shangzhen admired her beauty.

This lady, born of the peony, truly lived up to her name as a national beauty. Tonight was not in vain.

High above, thunder rumbled.

Jiang Shangzhen focused his gaze; it was a sword immortal passing by. He rose with a laugh, excusing himself to the Lady of Caozhou, soaring on the wind and transforming into a rainbow, as if the protective formation of Shinjing City was nothing.

The Lady of Caozhou stood there, momentarily stunned. This eloquent and cultured scholar had claimed to be an examinee heading to the capital, yet he had no choice but to borrow a place to stay at a temple?

Moments later, Jiang Shangzhen was struck down by a sword and angrily brushed off the dust, sneaking back into Shinjing City, returning to the temple, and repeatedly apologizing to the Lady of Caozhou.

With a resentful look, the lady held her heart and asked, “Who exactly are you?”

The man raised his cup and laughed softly, “If I don’t ask whether you are a celestial guest who has descended to the mortal realm, yet you ask for my name, doesn’t that make me, a mere mortal, even more mundane?”

The Lady of Caozhou sighed, waving her sleeve, “Go away, go away! You speak no serious words; I shan’t drink with you anymore.”

Jiang Shangzhen stood up and bowed as he left, but he left his walking stick at the banquet. The Lady of Caozhou didn't remind him.

A streak of sword light landed before the Biyou Palace by the Mahe River. The sword immortal addressed the ghostly gatekeeper, saying, “Inform your Water Goddess…”

Before Zuo Yu could finish, the Water Goddess at the Mahe River, who was enjoying a bowl of eel noodle soup, had already sensed the sudden arrival of a sword immortal. Worried that her gatekeeper, being a ghost, might inadvertently annoy the sword immortal and get chopped to pieces, she quickly shrank the rivers and mountains, arriving at the gate in an instant. Puffing her cheeks, she mumbled angrily, “What brings you here at this hour?”

Zuo Yu smiled, “I am Zuo Yu, the senior brother of Chen Ping'an.”

The Mahe River Water Goddess was initially taken aback, then her eyes sparkled. She slapped her face, realizing this wasn’t a dream!

“Damn! The disciple of the literary saint is truly more handsome than the last!”

By the banks of the great river in central Baoping Prefecture, Cui Dongshan was flipping through a book.

Liu Qingfeng sat nearby, chewing on a somewhat cold and hard rice dumpling, savoring it slowly.

Cui Dongshan closed the book and handed the freshly printed volume over to Liu Qingfeng, “Take a look.”

Liu Qingfeng accepted the book, flipping through it while still chewing on the rice dumpling. At first, he flipped the pages quickly, but the preface was rather mundane, so he took his time with the dumpling.

As Liu Qingfeng seemed to find something interesting, he smiled, slowing down his pace. It told the story of two good friends and their adventures, with an age difference of seven to eight years. Both came from humble beginnings, and the younger of the two, Gu Can, ended up in a place called the Bamboo Lake, where he first embarked on his cultivation journey. The older boy, who was just starting to learn martial arts, was named Chen Ping'an.

Young Gu Can, upon arriving at the Bamboo Lake brimming with wild practitioners, abducted many young women to become his concubines, intending to present them to his elder brother, Chen Ping'an, who was regarded as the leader among the ten friends of the Bamboo Lake.

The story unfolded in two parallel lines, progressing together. Gu Can became a reckless tyrant at the Bamboo Lake, while Chen Ping'an traveled alone, wandering through the mountains and rivers. Eventually, when they reunited, the now-expert martial artist saved Gu Can, who had angered the masses, offering some mundane gold and silver, hastily arranging some rituals to placate the masses. Afterward, the young martial artist discreetly departed, while Gu Can vanished without a trace.

In the end, a sect and a troop of iron-clad warriors tidied up the aftermath, holding a grand ceremony and rituals for those who perished unjustly.

Cui Dongshan smiled and asked, “What’s your impression after reading this?”

Liu Qingfeng retorted, “What happened to the two groups of people who initially wrote and published this book?”

Cui Dongshan replied, “Either dead or injured.”

Liu Qingfeng nodded, “The pacing is quite good. If they had pursued a complete extermination, treating the viewers of the mountains and rivers as fools, it would have been a mistake. Since that well-read young martial artist still has some conscience and enjoys seeking fame, he naturally wouldn’t act so brutally. If I had been the one behind the scenes planning this, I would have let Gu Can commit the crimes, and then Chen Ping'an would reveal himself to stop him, only to carelessly expose his identity to the lucky survivors. This way, it would be entirely reasonable.”

“It’s not just reasonable; it’s coherent.”

“In that mountain and water report, which sect was the first to recommend this book?”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “It’s an insignificant small sect that specializes in this line of work. They have already fled, though they might have been killed to silence them, making their actions rather discreet and temporarily untraceable. To be honest, I’m quite reluctant to investigate.”

Liu Qingfeng sighed, “Speaking of which, the opening passage of this book, just a few thousand words long, is truly simple yet moving. It encapsulates many hardships of the common folk.”

Various customs were vividly portrayed, such as the villagers fighting for water at night, the young boys climbing mountains to collect firewood and charcoal, returning with wicker baskets filled with their burdens, and haggling with wealthy merchants at the market, often being scolded and stepping back. When the boy received those copper coins, his palms were riddled with calluses.

During the bitterly cold winter, the boy gathered herbs on the mountain to earn some money, his hands cracking from frostbite, carefully picking herbs to ensure they didn’t get stained with blood, and when selling them to the pharmacy below, receiving a meager price.

Describing such scenes usually took just a few words, yet the opening text evoked a sense of pity for the boy. Among the exquisite phrases, there were even some remarkable words that allowed men to grasp the subtlety of emotions, such as the description of rural customs concerning “滞穗.” This referred to the time when the wheat was ripe, and orphaned mothers could pick the leftover wheat after the harvest, even if it wasn’t from their own fields. The farmers wouldn’t chase them away, and the young men cutting the wheat wouldn’t look back, showcasing a deep-rooted respect for tradition.

One particularly poignant line depicted a moment when the young boy helped a widow. He raised his head and caught sight of the woman crouching on the ground, causing him to blush and hastily lower his gaze, turning to glance at the abundant wheat nearby.

This single movement of looking up, lowering his head, and then glancing to the side vividly portrayed the pure yet complex feelings of a hardworking boy.

The story thereafter would likely appeal to everyone, whether they were down-and-out scholars, wanderers of the Jianghu, or cultivators on the mountains. Aside from Gu Can’s rampant behavior at the Bamboo Lake, it also chronicled the subsequent extraordinary adventures of the young boy, interweaving a series of significant encounters without feeling abrupt. For instance, he stumbled upon an ancient martial arts manual in the depths of the mountains, and after wandering, he unexpectedly met an extraordinary master, achieving a minor success in martial arts. Upon entering an immortal’s abode, he learned a superior technique. He fought decisively against demons and monsters, embodying the spirit of a spirited young hero.

Moreover, he struck a bond with several mountain gods and water immortals, sharing fleeting encounters with beautiful women in the Jianghu, and even helped a beautiful ghost clear her name, creating quite a stir in the city god’s court, all beautifully captured in the writing.

What a compassionate young man he was.

The key was that the young wanderer’s diligent and studious nature was well documented. Only after this would the main event at the Bamboo Lake unfold. 

With many dangers lurking, one wave after another, he finally succeeded in saving Gu Can, who had angered the masses, and during this process, the young martial artist displayed cleverness and used the techniques of the immortals to his advantage. He obtained a sword nurturing gourd, aided by two fairies who looked after him, even risking a split from their sect to do so, allowing the readers to enjoy the thrilling escapade.

Liu Qingfeng suddenly realized he still held onto half of the rice dumpling, finishing it in a hurry.

Bamboo Lake, Book Lake. Bamboo can’t write it all.

Gu Can, Gu Can. The character for “Can” means repentance. The homophonic character is Gu Can (顾璨).

Chen Ping'an. Of course, this also sounds like Chen Ping'an (陈平安).

At the end of the book, it stated, “The young wanderer glanced back at Bamboo Lake, feeling no guilt, yet his conscience was uneasy. He tugged at his collar, resembling a scholar’s robe, and found himself speechless for a long time, overwhelmed by emotions. Ultimately, he could only drink deeply from a cup of wine and leave, lost in thought.”

What a splendid departure, it could be called truly remarkable.

As for whether the young wanderer would return home or continue his adventures in the Jianghu, the book did not specify.

Liu Qingfeng gently closed the book and returned it to Cui Dongshan, smiling, “After finishing the book, having a hearty meal, doing what a scholar ought to do—that is the essence of being a scholar.”

Cui Dongshan, however, after laughing, began rolling around beside Liu Qingfeng.

Liu Qingfeng helplessly remarked, “With your means, Cui Dongshan, it wouldn’t be difficult to completely suppress this book, right?”

Cui Dongshan merely rolled around on the ground, flailing his sleeves as dust flew everywhere.

Liu Qingfeng rubbed his forehead.

Cui Dongshan sat up and, with his hands in his sleeves, lowered his head, “Actually, I’m not angry at all; I’m just a bit…”

Liu Qingfeng interjected, “Disappointed.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “Wrong. Quite the opposite.”

Cui Dongshan raised one hand, aligning his fingers, and lightly lifted them, “I am willing to be a lamp in the dark room of night, illuminating the dust for thousands of years.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 809: Adding Flowers to the Brocade

The River God of the Buried River led the admired Sword Immortal into the hall, guiding him around a shadow wall linked to the river’s transport. As they walked through corridors and passages, they arrived at the main hall where an elderly cook had just returned from the kitchen, holding a small dish filled with bright red chili peppers, cooked in heavy oil, exuding a spicy aroma. Stammering, the old cook asked, “Madam... Madam, do you still want the chili peppers?”

Earlier, the River Goddess had complained that tonight’s oil-fried eel noodles lacked a kick, instructing the cook to stir-fry a dish of chili peppers. Little did she expect that before he could return, the Sword Immortal would arrive at the Biyou Palace.

She glanced at the small dish in the cook's hand, then at the bowl of oil-fried eel noodles on the table, finally turning her gaze toward the Sword Immortal beside her, feeling rather embarrassed. 

It was a rare occasion to have a late-night snack, only to be caught in the act. If she had known, she would have used a smaller bowl.

Zuo said, “The River Goddess should just continue enjoying her midnight snack; I’m not in a hurry to return to the Tongye Sect. After you finish eating, I’ll discuss serious matters.”

Look at that—what a down-to-earth Sword Immortal, what a humble and considerate scholar. This was the true heir of the Wensheng (Literary Sage), indeed. She couldn’t help but marvel at how understanding the scholars of the Wensheng lineage were.

Tentatively, she asked, “Shall I get a bowl for Mr. Zuo as well?”

Zuo, who had settled into a side seat, glanced at the large bowl on the table and replied, “No need.”

“Then I’ll trouble Mr. Zuo to wait a moment. The belly is the biggest thing in the world, ha ha!”

After exchanging pleasantries, she was done with the formalities, taking the dish of chili peppers from the old cook and pouring it into her noodles. Grabbing her chopsticks, she mixed everything together and then began to eat heartily, habitually propping one leg up on the chair, only to suddenly remember that Mr. Zuo was sitting next to her. She quickly sat up straight, and after every few large bites, she would reach for the wine jar on the table, taking a sip of the palace's home-brewed liquor. The fiery brew, paired with the chili peppers, made the petite River Goddess close her eyes and shiver with delight after each sip, wiping the sweat from her forehead before continuing to devour her “bowl” of eel noodles.

The Biyou Palace had no unnecessary formalities or strict rules. For instance, the old cook stayed in the hall, fully justified, waiting to take away the bowls and dishes after the River Goddess finished her meal.

Several female officials and maids of the Biyou Palace, who had drowned as water ghosts in the Buried River, cautiously clustered on both sides of the door, as a Sword Immortal was a rare sight. It was good to catch a glimpse of his celestial aura. They dared not make a sound, merely widening their eyes to observe the man sitting with his eyes closed in meditation. So, this was the Mr. Zuo who had “visited” the Tongye Sect twice. As the River Goddess put it, he had cut down Du Mao, who had reached the Ascension stage, with a single sword. In the heavens and on earth, only he, Mr. Zuo, was worthy. In front of Mr. Zuo, there was no one capable in the Tongye Continent; even the old head of the Yuguizong, Xu, was no match, and the new sect master, Jiang Shangzhen, was even less impressive.

Having finished her noodles, the River Goddess glared at the entrance and shouted, “Haven’t you seen enough?!”

With that, the crowd dispersed.

She chose to sit across from Zuo but picked a chair closer to the door, smiling, “Apologies, Mr. Zuo. Our Biyou Palace usually doesn’t receive many divine guests. They always complain that I, the River Goddess, have no face, but let them have a good look today.”

Zuo opened his eyes and replied, “No problem.”

The reason he had flown south to the Buried River and visited the Biyou Palace tonight was that he had something to personally deliver to the River Goddess, who his junior disciple had described as possessing a bold spirit that couldn’t be contained even by the River itself. Years ago, outside a tavern on the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping’an had personally stated that the two sitting in the middle were enjoying drinks while sharing stories of rivers and mountains.

The Biyou Palace had endured many hardships in its rise from a mansion to a palace. If it weren’t for the gentleman, Zhong Kui, from the Great Fushu Academy’s assistance, the Biyou Mansion might not have succeeded in becoming a palace, and it would have been recorded by the academy. This was because the River Goddess had insisted on acquiring a text from the Wensheng as a treasured possession for the future Biyou Palace, which was indeed against the rules. The Wensheng had long been expelled from Confucianism, and his statue had been removed from the Confucian Temple, with all his works banned and destroyed. It should be noted that the mountain lord of the Great Fushu Academy had also come from the Yasheng lineage, so the Biyou Mansion still rose to become the Biyou Palace. The River Goddess was not only grateful for Zhong Kui’s righteous words but had also changed her perception of the mountain lord; his knowledge may not have been vast, but his tolerance was significant.

She seemed unusually anxious, and since Zuo remained silent, the atmosphere in the hall turned somewhat cold. The River Goddess wracked her brain to come up with an opening line, unsure if she felt shy or excited. Her eyes sparkled, though her teeth chattered slightly as she sat up straight, gripping the armrests of her chair, causing her feet to leave the ground. “Mr. Zuo, they say your swordsmanship is unparalleled, that your sword aura is so abundant that no earthly immortals dare to approach within a hundred miles. Just the aura itself is a small realm! But you are compassionate, so as not to harm living beings, you travel the seas to seek celestial friends, distancing yourself from the mortal world…”

Zuo shook his head, saying, “It’s not that exaggerated. Back then, as long as one put their heart into it, the sword aura wouldn’t harm others.”

She sighed, “Mr. Zuo is truly strong!”

Zuo replied, “Just call me Zuo; I can’t accept the title of ‘Mr.’”

She vigorously shook her head, “No, no! If I don’t call you Mr. Zuo, calling you the Sword Immortal would sound too ordinary. There are quite a few Sword Immortals in the world; however, there are few true scholars in my heart. As for directly calling your name, I’m not drunk enough for that!”

Zuo was too lazy to argue over this. He stood up, took a book from his sleeve, and walked toward the River Goddess.

She immediately jumped to her feet, hurriedly rubbing her hands on her clothing, receiving the yellowed book with utmost respect.

The book was made from the most ordinary materials, printed and carved by a small country’s bookstore in the Central Land. Aside from being the first edition, there was nothing else noteworthy about it. Due to the poor financial condition of the bookseller, the bookstore was small, and the quality of the paper, font, and printing processes were all subpar. At the time, the book didn’t sell well, so the teacher personally funded the purchase of nearly a hundred copies, sending several disciples to different bookstores to buy them, fearing that if the bookstore had only one, it might not deserve to occupy a spot and would end up stored away, never to see the light of day again.

Back then, Zuo’s group spent several days buying books separately. Zuo would pay and leave quickly, heading to the next bookstore. The only one who took their time was Xiao Qi, who would only return to the academy after dark. When asked how many books he bought, he would answer, causing the teacher to laugh heartily. It turned out that Xiao Qi bought only one book each time and inevitably ended up chatting with the shopkeeper for half a day about the book’s content, leading many shopkeepers to mistakenly believe that the dusty book was a precious work of a sage, capable of inspiring such admiration from a gifted scholar. Consequently, they would later doubt themselves and order a few more copies from familiar booksellers, and then Xiao Qi would remind the senior brother to return to the bookstores he visited in a few days and buy another.

Zuo said, “My junior disciple promised Biyou Palace to send a book by my teacher, but he’s busy now, so I came tonight to deliver it.”

She nodded gently as she accepted the book, “I knew Teacher Chen would keep his word; I just never expected it would be you, Mr. Zuo, to help deliver it.”

Zuo smiled, “Not only that, but my junior disciple mentioned many things about the River Goddess and Biyou Palace to our teacher. After hearing it, our teacher was truly delighted and drank quite a bit more wine.”

She was overwhelmed with excitement, her voice trembling. “Even the Wensheng knows about me?”

Zuo nodded, “My teacher said the River Goddess is truly a hero with insight and also said that his knowledge is, in comparison to the Sage’s, somewhat lacking.”

The Wensheng of yore was renowned for his beautiful prose, yet his writing was rigorous, his reasoning profound, and his logic clear. Even those with only a rough understanding of literature could easily comprehend it. Thus, the elderly scholar, who had only reached the status of a minor scholar, was fondly known for his teaching, “Harmony of the Three Teachings, Great Achievement of All Scholars.”

The River Goddess was at a loss for words, feeling somewhat dizzy, as if she had consumed ten thousand jin of fine wine.

Zuo added, “However, my teacher also advised that this book should be privately collected by the River Goddess and not enshrined; it’s unnecessary.”

She replied, “Since it’s the Wensheng’s teaching, I shall comply.”

Zuo then took out several bamboo slips, stacking them together, and handed them to her. The first bamboo slip had six characters written on it. Zuo explained, “This is the character ‘Shen’ (神), written in six different styles. It is the original form of the ‘Shen’ character created by the Sage of Rites, embodying both sound and meaning. Over time, it has evolved through seal, clerical, regular, cursive, and standard scripts. The general meaning is to hope that the River Goddess doesn’t forget her responsibilities and continues to protect the land and water. As for these bamboo slips, they once belonged to my junior disciple.”

The River Goddess accepted the first bamboo slip, feeling as if the small slip weighed a thousand pounds in her hand.

Zuo suddenly laughed, “At that time, my teacher had a bit too much to drink, and it was my junior disciple who insisted he send a few words to Biyou Palace. In fact, my teacher hasn’t picked up a brush to write for a long time. My junior disciple, being there, urged the teacher to write with more spirit; otherwise, it wouldn’t be presentable, and it would damage the teacher’s imposing image in the River Goddess’s eyes.”

There were some things that could be said and others that could not be mentioned. For example, Zuo felt that Chen Ping’an had been too impudent; as a disciple, he lacked the proper decorum, but as soon as Zuo muttered something, Chen Ping’an had called out “Teacher,” and the teacher responded with a slap.

When fellow disciples reported, Zuo had been punished, but it became a habit.

Zuo handed over the second bamboo slip, “This is a message of great expectation from my teacher, hoping that you will have smooth sailing on your path.”

Gathering water creates a deep pool, from which dragons are born; accumulating good deeds leads to virtue, and thus divine beings gain their hearts.

After handing over the third slip, Zuo said, “My teacher believes Biyou Palace and the River Goddess deserve this saying.”

Striving for righteousness leads to wealth and honor; valuing morality leads to humility.

Zuo handed over the fourth bamboo slip, “Before I put pen to paper, my teacher said he was being presumptuous, taking on the role of an elder to impart a few words of advice to a junior, hoping you wouldn't mind. He also mentioned that as the River Goddess, aside from maintaining your own integrity, you should also feel the joys and sorrows of the people in your domain. Nowadays, all deities come from the people.”

Humble gifts are valued over strength; poverty leads to theft, while wealth leads to robbery.

Zuo handed over the final bamboo slip, “Those who know themselves don’t blame others; those who know their fate don’t blame heaven. This saying is a message from my teacher to you, but it is also a message to all scholars in the world.”

Having received a book from the Wensheng and five bamboo slips, the River Goddess felt as if she were dreaming, murmuring, “I don’t deserve this.”

Zuo said solemnly, “There’s one thing I must say more about. If you think you have earned the favor of Chen Ping’an, who is a direct disciple of my teacher, thus causing my teacher to give you such ‘favorable eyes,’ then you are mistaken. That would be underestimating my teacher’s scholarship. The sequence of learning from the Wensheng lineage should not be understood this way. It was first the River Goddess and the Biyou Mansion, and only then the meeting of the River Goddess and my junior disciple. It was first your sincere recognition of the Wensheng’s teachings that led to my teacher’s return of courtesy.”

She sparkled with enthusiasm, “Of course!”

After Zuo delivered the book and bamboo slips, he prepared to return immediately to the Tongye Sect.

She glanced at the night sky and urged, “Mr. Zuo, won’t you have a drink? The liquor brewed here at Biyou Mansion has a bit of fame.”

Zuo shook his head, “I don’t like drinking.”

She felt a bit disappointed, thinking it was a pity.

Zuo bid his farewell and crossed the threshold, flying away on his sword.

She stood at the door, looking up to watch the Sword Immortal’s figure fade into the distance, sincerely sighing, “Mr. Zuo, so tall and strong!”

As Zuo soared away from the Buried River region, he sped past the Great Spring Capital, relieved that Jiang Shangzhen had learned from his earlier encounter with a sword.

He couldn’t help but recall that time they had drunk together.

The teacher, tipsy, asked his junior disciple, “To observe eternity, count today; to know billions, examine one or two. Is that difficult?”

The junior disciple replied, “To understand the ancient is to know the present; to know the recent is to know the distant; to know one is to know ten thousand; to know the minute is to know the vast; to know the obscure is to know the bright. Knowing is easy, but acting is hard; it’s not difficult, really.”

The teacher laughed and asked Zuo to fetch another jar of wine, reminding him to settle the bill, as brother disciples must keep their accounts clear and not take advantage of their junior disciple’s tavern.

Indeed, Chen Ping’an was a bit stronger than his senior brother.

He could make the teacher’s drinking less lonely, allowing him to forget the sorrows of ages.

It was no wonder he was the teacher’s favorite among the brothers.

Zuo felt no displeasure at this; rather, he was pleased that the teacher had taken such a junior disciple for himself and Xiao Qi.

The excavation of the Great Dike on Baoping Continent had been overseen by Cui Dongshan, while the specific tasks were managed by Guan Yiran and Liu Xunmei. However, the true mastermind was Liu Qingfeng.

One was a prominent family from the Great Li Dynasty, another a seedling from Chier Street, and a former official of the Qingluan Kingdom.

Cui Dongshan never interacted with the mountain cultivators or officials overseeing the dike, leaving everything to the three young people. Only when Liu Qingfeng encountered troublesome matters would he consult Cui Dongshan, who was known for his efficiency, rarely leaving anything unresolved overnight.

Along the route of the Great Dike, they had to cross the territories of dozens of vassal states. The temples and altars of various water deities would be affected by the Great Dike, and many mountain sects would have to relocate their mountain gates and ancestral halls.

After Lin Shouyi returned from the Shuijian Lake, Cui Dongshan kept him by his side to personally guide his cultivation.

Lin Shouyi had previously exchanged an ancestral mountain chart of the blind Daoist Jiao Cheng for the middle and lower volumes of the “Cloud Lantern Book” from the lord of the Baidi City. The upper volume dealt with Golden Elixir, the middle volume with refining the Nascent Soul, and the lower volume pointed directly to the Jade Purity.

Now, Lin Shouyi had reached the Dragon Gate stage, breaking through quickly and with great resilience; this truly was a promising seed in cultivation.

Lin Shouyi initially expected to achieve the Golden Elixir within a hundred years, but now it seemed he would do so much sooner. The Dragon Gate stage and the Golden Elixir stage were two formidable thresholds for Qi practitioners. Generally, those deemed “geniuses” before reaching the Golden Elixir stage often fell short, failing to withstand scrutiny, and many would be left lingering in the Dragon Gate stage for life, ultimately losing hope for the Dao.

In the transmission of Daoist teachings, it was most important to avoid gossip.

However, in Cui Dongshan’s case, worldly logic didn’t apply.

Lin Shouyi handed over all three volumes of the “Cloud Lantern Book” to Cui Dongshan. After reviewing them, the latter filled the margins with notes and returned them to Lin Shouyi, instructing him to come back and consult him if he didn’t understand the true meaning of the text.

Today, Lin Shouyi accompanied Cui Dongshan to inspect a dike. Dust filled the air, and the river course had already been established, though water had yet to be diverted here; the laborers on this bank were invisible to those on the opposite side, giving a glimpse of the Great Dike’s vastness in the future.

Cui Dongshan repeatedly patted the dust away from his sleeves, saying, “During my travels for study, I thank that little lady whose aspirations were higher than her stature, who looked down on everyone but was willing to see you as a fellow Daoist.”

Lin Shouyi nodded slightly; it was evident to everyone that the little lady’s pride was rather straightforward, making her easier to deal with. The one he couldn’t see through was the exiled prince of the Lu dynasty, Yu Lu.

However, when such words came from Cui Dongshan, it felt somewhat like a rebuke.

Chen Ping’an and Yu Lu were pure warriors, while Li Baoping and Li Huai were still young. Before becoming a convict’s survivor, Xie Xie had been recognized as the top celestial seed of the Lu dynasty, deemed the most promising genius to reach the upper five realms. Lin Shouyi had been the earliest to step into cultivation, aside from Xie Xie.

Lin Shouyi, troubled, asked, “If we can’t even defend the Sword Qi Great Wall, can we really protect Baoping Continent?”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “What if we can protect it? What if we can’t? If we know we can’t protect it, will we just give up? Are we to let the sages of the Confucian Temple meet the forces of the Moon-Trapping Mountain to compare their paper strength, while we in the Haoran world boast of the names of upper five realm cultivators, claiming we are better? Then let the demons retreat to the wilderness; if we are worse than them, let the demon lords not be in a hurry to act, and we’ll just hand over a world and retreat from the fifth world, then watch as the Moon-Trapping Mountain and the Baiyu Capital engage in their next contest of skills.”

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, saying, “Strangely enough, this method is the least likely to offend.”

Lin Shouyi replied, “That’s not what I meant.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Of course I know that’s not what you meant. You are worried about the lives of all the people below the mountains.”

Lin Shouyi asked, “What should we do? I earnestly request you to teach me.”

Cui Dongshan gazed up at the highest point of the Baoping sky, softly saying, “All mountain cultivators, along with my Da Li military personnel, should straighten their spines and be the first to march to their deaths. As for the rest who wish to survive, they should kneel and beg for mercy after the first group has fallen. As for the common folk below, there’s really nothing we can do; they can only leave their fate to heaven.”

In a government residence in the capital of the Qingluan Kingdom.

Li Baozhen rarely had a moment to spare, pulling himself away from a pile of reports from vassal officials and Da Li’s water intelligence to sit at the same table with two family members for a drink.

Li Baozhen now held multiple positions: he was one of the heads of the Green Wave Pavilion in Da Li, overseeing all intelligence in the southeastern region of the continent, and he had also leisurely risen through the ranks in recent years to become the Minister of Rites in the Qingluan Kingdom, recently returning to the capital twice to serve as the main examiner for local township examinations, becoming a “master of literary balance.” Additionally, he served as the “behind-the-scenes monarch” of several vassal states in the Qingluan Kingdom, secretly manipulating the ascent of various budding cultivators and the succession of mountain sects.

Li Baozhen tossed a book across the table to the middle-aged man opposite him, chuckling, “Our old countryman, the young and down-and-out master of the Falling Mountain, seems to have thoroughly ruined his reputation on Baoping Continent.”

The man was Zhu He, the former guardian of the Li residence on Fulu Street, while the young woman was his daughter, Zhu Lu.

This father-daughter pair had long since shed their lower status; Zhu He had nabbed a position in the Da Li military, serving among the military cultivators for many years. His status was comparable to that of Wei Xian, the overseer of the Great Dike, though Zhu He’s military achievements were far inferior, and now he held a low-ranking position as a lance bearer. Once he transitioned to local government, he would likely end up as a county officer in a vassal state, but compared to ordinary vassal officials, he would possess the distinction of a martial merit.

Aside from the newly established position of the patrol envoy, which held the same rank as the Prime Minister, the official hierarchy had undergone substantial changes, with both civil and military officials adding six ranks to their respective tiers.

Zhu Lu had become a spy for the Green Wave Pavilion, working under Li Baozhen.

Zhu He opened the book, feeling as if he had fallen into a fog. He glanced at his daughter, who appeared to be smiling, clearly already aware of the situation.

Li Baozhen poured three cups of wine, keeping one for himself while sliding the other two across the table to Zhu He and Zhu Lu, indicating that the father and daughter didn’t need to get up and thank him. He added with a smile, “It’s quite possible that this will soon be banned by Da Li, but it might just as quickly be published as an external edition or a separate transmission. If this book isn’t banned, I’m quite looking forward to the annotated version, to spare many from misunderstanding its many subtleties.”

Zhu He flipped through the book, questioning, “Gu Zhan, Chen Ping’an? Is this referring to the Gu Can from Niping Alley and Chen Ping’an?”

Li Baozhen merely drank in silence while Zhu Lu took a small sip from her cup.

Zhu He frowned, “What’s this?”

The man was somewhat at a loss for words. He had only spent a short time with Chen Ping’an while escorting Li Baoping on her travels, but he believed he understood Chen Ping’an’s character well. The content in the book, if deemed false, wasn’t entirely so; and if deemed true, it always seemed to be just a few details off, giving one the feeling that something was amiss. For example, the hidden, unflattering youthful sentiments, and the so-called impoverished youth determined to travel thousands of miles, reading thousands of books, aspiring to emulate those moral paragons…

An accidentally acquired extraordinary martial arts manual? Just because he was a talented young man with exceptional potential, he needed no tempering, swiftly breaking through in martial arts, achieving three realms in a single day? So effortlessly that he drew gasps of surprise from several hidden masters and mountain immortals? As for the adventures he had before his travels, the fortunes that kept coming his way, and the proactive involvement he had in righting wrongs, painting a picture of a spirited, chivalrous young man who always seemed to be rewarded tenfold for every sacrifice he made…

Yet in Zhu He’s eyes, Chen Ping’an was exactly the opposite—he was far more mature, lacking youthful vigor.

As for the so-called confidante, given Chen Ping’an’s wooden disposition, it was laughable.

Zhu He shook his head, both amused and frustrated.

Zhu He wasn’t foolish; although he wasn’t a scholar, he could still see the heavy undercurrents of murder hidden within. The wandering youth in the book, being a scholar, placed great emphasis on righteousness and would readily kill others. While it wasn’t mindless slaughter, upon deeper inquiry, aside from a few troublesome ghosts and monsters, most others who perished by Chen Ping’an’s fists were those whose lives could have been spared, existing in a gray area of morality.

Zhu He flipped through the book rapidly, unable to restrain himself from asking, “Didn’t I hear the young master say that Chen Ping’an was actually stuck at the Shuijian Lake for many years and had a rather tragic ending? Didn’t he return home until many years later?”

Zhu Lu scoffed lightly. 

He had a tendency to seek out trouble for himself, and now it was his retribution.

If it were her, with a friend like Gu Can, she would either maintain their relationship in secret or weigh the pros and cons, and simply ignore him, letting him fade away in the Shuijian Lake. What business did she have with Chen Ping’an? If he couldn’t even earn a spot among the ten outstanding youth from the North Julu Continent, how had he gained even greater fame than those twenty young talents? Chen Ping’an’s luck was truly impressive, as always.

Li Baozhen raised his wine cup, slowly swirling it, smiling, “As readers, who doesn’t love reading about romantic encounters in the rivers and lakes or the fortuitous events on the mountains? However, the philosophers who have read this book will have plenty to say. The heroes of the rivers and lakes will curse this person for seeking fame, arguing that he neither killed Gu Can nor used this to cultivate his reputation, spending a few hundred taels to hastily organize a few rituals and feel justified? The mountain sects will regard him as a mere wild cultivator, while the wild cultivators will criticize him for his lack of Daoist wisdom, merely relying on good fortune. If it weren’t for the people in the book, he would have died a dozen times already. Scholars, on the other hand, would admire him while simultaneously condemn him for his hypocritical demeanor, saying he’s worse than a beast.”

Zhu He remarked, “Additionally, the book deliberately details the contents of that martial arts manual and the methods of cultivation. Although they are merely superficial principles and entry-level techniques, I’m sure many in the rivers and lakes and among wild cultivators would covet them, causing this book to spread widely through the mountains and markets. How can it be banned? It’s utterly impossible to stop it. If the Da Li government openly bans this book, it will only serve to further promote it.”

Li Baozhen downed his cup of wine, “As the Falling Mountain expands, and Chen Ping’an’s realm rises, the criticisms from the Baoping Continent will only grow. The greater his achievements, the louder the curses. After all, it’s all the result of selfish motives; at most, he’s just a fake benevolent person pretending to be righteous. The person who compiled this book, aside from Liu Qingfeng, is the scholar I admire the most. I truly want to meet him and sincerely seek his guidance.”

Li Baozhen looked toward the door and smiled, “Mr. Liu, do you agree? If there’s a chance in the future, why don’t we join forces to visit this fellow Daoist?”

Liu Qingfeng stood at the door, smiling, “Isn’t it easy for us, who have read the teachings of the sages, to hunt righteousness with unrighteousness? Even if we succeed, what sense of achievement is there?”

Li Baozhen raised his empty wine cup, “Mr. Liu is always a step ahead of me.”

Liu Qingfeng waved his hand, “I sought you out this time to discuss a matter.”

Li Baozhen set down his cup, smiling as he rose, “Then let’s change to another place.”

Zhu He and Zhu Lu both recognized the unexpected guest and, therefore, stood up earlier than Li Baozhen, cupping their fists in greeting, simultaneously saying, “Greetings, Supervisor Liu.”

The notoriously infamous official of the Qingluan Kingdom, according to Li Baozhen, was destined to become a high-ranking official in Da Li, but aside from being short-lived and having a limited lifespan, Liu Qingfeng had no weaknesses and was an extremely dangerous figure. To him, mountain immortals and vassal monarchs were nothing to worry about.

Liu Qingfeng smiled warmly, lightly nodding to the two.

After discussing matters with Li Baozhen, Liu Qingfeng, accompanied by Wang Yifu, instructed one of the military cultivators to steer a celestial ferry hurriedly toward the peak of a high mountain, where the official road lay at the foot.

Liu Qingfeng used his ability to observe mountains and rivers to look down the road at the foot of the mountain, spotting a pair of男女 slowly making their way.

The young man walked with a limp, while the plain-looking woman with a sword at her waist glanced toward the mountain peak intentionally or unintentionally and then slightly nodded, pretending nothing had happened.

However, when the woman raised her head to glance, the military cultivator with a Nascent Soul was taken aback by the heavy killing intent emanating from her.

Liu Qingfeng remarked, “You can retract your divine senses now.”

At the foot of the mountain were Liu Qingshan and Liu Boqi, a couple returning from the Master’s Sword House on the Inverted Mountain, heading back to her family home.

In truth, Liu Boqi hadn’t initially intended to go, but Liu Qingshan insisted on meeting her master, regardless of the outcome—whether it would end in a scolding or being driven away from the Inverted Mountain, it was a matter of courtesy. However, upon reaching the old dragon city, they found that several intercontinental ferries were no longer allowed to set sail. No matter how Liu Qingfeng inquired, the response was always ignorance. Eventually, it was Liu Boqi who took the initiative to go out for a visit and brought back the shocking news that the Inverted Mountain no longer permitted the boats from the eight continents to dock because the Sword Qi Great Wall had started to tighten security, ceasing all trade with the Haoran realm. Liu Boqi wasn’t too worried about the Master’s Sword House but felt some regret in her heart. She had originally planned to leave an incense offering before heading to the Sword Qi Great Wall on her own, and as for when she would return home, she would tell her husband three words, not necessarily.

Liu Boqi hesitated for a moment before saying, “Shouldn’t we go take a look at how my brother is overseeing the excavation of the Great Dike?”

Liu Qingshan shook his head, “I don’t have such a brother.”

Liu Boqi replied helplessly, “He has his reasons.”

Liu Qingshan looked gloomy, “In the Qingluan Kingdom, there’s Liu Qingfeng; in the Da Li Dynasty, there’s Liu Qingfeng, but I don’t have such a brother. The Lion’s Garden and the Liu family genealogy do not include him.”

Liu Boqi didn’t try to persuade him any further. Back then, Liu Qingfeng had reminded her, as his sister-in-law, outside the family shrine that some things didn’t need to be discussed with Liu Qingshan.

The lame scholar suddenly reddened his eyes. The hard work of excavating the Great Dike—this fellow wasn’t a cultivator, and he liked to do things personally…

The source of the first Great Dike in the history of Baoping Continent was a maid named Zhi Gui from Niping Alley, standing alone by the water, her expression fluctuating. 

This Great Dike was known as the Qi Dike!

Moreover, she could continue her journey along the river thanks to that damned release contract hidden in her sleeve!

When the contract was first established, the orphan from Niping Alley, whose life lamp was as weak as a candle in the wind, had no idea at all. 

Little did she expect that this fellow would dare to unilaterally terminate the contract now?!

Before dawn, in a minister’s residence in the capital of Da Li, a centenarian suddenly changed his mind after dressing up in official robes, saying he wouldn’t attend the morning audience.

The old man changed into his home attire, and an old servant held a lantern as they both went to the study. After lighting the lamp, the old Minister of Personnel sat at his desk, smiling, “How many years has it been since I’ve taken the time to read a book properly?”

Due to his old age, the man’s eyesight had deteriorated, and he had to lean closer to the book in the light.

Suddenly, the old man murmured, “Cui, you weren’t lying. The scholars of Da Li really won’t be looked down upon by outsiders just because of their status as Da Li scholars and their fluent Da Li dialect.”

The old man turned to gaze out at the dim night sky, “I just don’t know if our Da Li scholars will overnight transform into the very scholars we once despised the most?”

At the city’s oldest flowering trees, outside the family’s study, the green paulownia, Han family’s wisteria, and the peonies of the Report Nation Temple flourished.

Old Man Guan had frequently sighed at the holes in the green paulownia tree over the years, and when one of his descendants suggested that since the ancestor cherished the tree so much, they should invite a mountain immortal to cast a spell, he was scolded mercilessly, calling them an unworthy descendant. Only the legitimate great-grandson, Guan Yiran, could enjoy admiring the green paulownia with Old Man Guan, and after some conversation, the old man felt slightly reassured.

Staring out at the night sky, the elder sighed, “I only hope it doesn’t come to that. Scholars should still talk about the spirit of literary gentlemen and the spirit of scholars.”

Words that do not exceed actual deeds, actions that are not based on principles, and remarks that do not result in true discussions.

The old man suddenly dropped the book, stood up, and declared, “Quickly prepare a carriage; I’ll attend the morning audience!”

The old servant outside reminded, “Master, should you change into official robes first?”

The old man laughed heartily, “What’s the use of wearing ceremonial robes? Today, I intend to leave a mark in the history of Da Li! In the spring of the sixth year of Chun Jia, the Minister of Personnel, so-and-so, grew forgetful in his old age and attended the morning audience dressed in Confucian robes, which was against propriety, thus being halted outside the gates, shivering alone in the spring cold like a quail. How interesting, how amusing…”

The old servant added, “Master, should you keep some food hidden in your sleeves? It’s one thing to suffer from the cold, but to starve would be unwise. In this hunger and cold, your old body won’t withstand it.”

The old man chuckled, “Very clever!”

An old Confucian in green stood atop the walls of Da Li’s capital.

Behind him were the flickering lights of Da Li City, while in front were all sorts of people waiting to enter the city: merchants from different regions, students traveling for study, martial artists from the rivers and lakes, and mountain cultivators mixed in.

National Teacher Cui turned around to glance at the lights within the city. Since he took on the role of National Teacher, this capital city had never seen its lights extinguished for a moment, with at least one lamp burning brightly within the city for over a hundred years.

This was thanks to the brilliance of wealthy families, the everlasting lamps of various temples and monasteries, and the students studying late into the night in humble alleyways…

Cui turned his gaze outside the city, where merchants rubbed their hands together to keep warm, some hunched in their carriages dozing off, and some scholars from outside the region, having agreed to travel together, disembarking from hired carriages as dawn approached, pointing and discussing the city walls. Some children of wealthy families, awakened by the noise, cried out, causing their mothers great concern.

Standing alone atop the city walls, Cui hoped that every person entering the city—especially the young—would carry a glimmer of light in their eyes.

Aspirations, ambitions, desires.

Wealth, honor, fame, beauty, fine wine, opportunities.

Each to their own; our Da Li capital should have everything, so let them take their pick!

Liu Xianyang quietly returned home from Nan Posa Continent once again, this time intending to stay put, for within the Ancestor Hall of the Shenshow Mountain, since the Longquan Sword Sect was founded by Ruan Qiong, there was no need to hang ancestral portraits; Liu Xianyang only needed to burn incense.

The Longquan Sword Sect did not hold a grand ceremony for its founding; everything was simple, not even notifying a single family shrine.

They weren’t like that money-crazed Piyun Mountain.

Ruan Qiong merely called back Xu Xiaoqiao and Xie Ling from the north, gathering a few of the earliest direct disciples, and they shared a simple family meal together. Ruan Qiong, Ruan Xiu, Dong Gu, Xu Xiaoqiao, Xie Ling, and Liu Xianyang—just six of them.

Liu Xianyang wasn’t cultivating on the mountain, nor did he go to the new territory north of Da Li’s capital; instead, he went to the iron shop by the Longxu River, which had gradually fallen into disrepair after Xu Xiaoqiao left.

Liu Xianyang wasn’t particularly focused on cultivation either; the Longquan Sword Sect had yet to publicly announce his status as a direct disciple, so he spent his days wandering around.

Dong Gu arrived at the iron shop today, waiting for a long time before Liu Xianyang finally returned.

Liu Xianyang bounced over, cupping his fists with a smile, “Did the senior brother call for me? Why not just send a message via flying sword?”

Dong Gu shook his head with a smile, “It’s nothing urgent.”

Liu Xianyang brought two small bamboo chairs over, and they settled under the eaves. Liu Xianyang said, “Senior brother, just speak plainly; we’re family, no need for formalities.”

Dong Gu responded, “The master has accepted two batches of direct disciples, so your ranking has fallen too low. I find this inappropriate and wanted to ask if you had any thoughts on it.”

Seeing Liu Xianyang’s cheerful demeanor and that he seemed to have no thoughts on the matter, Dong Gu continued, “Please don’t think I’m testing you; that’s not my intention. I’ve long felt guilty about holding the title of senior brother. I’m just a lowly creature from the mountains, not a sword cultivator. For all these years, Da Li Mountain has been mocking this matter. If the master doesn’t mind, it reflects his generosity, but if I don’t mind, it’ll only solidify my non-human roots. What merit do I have to be the first disciple of the Longquan Sword Sect?!”

Their master, Ruan Qiong, wasn’t one to beat around the bush. He had clearly stated at the dinner table that Liu Xianyang was a Golden Elixir sword cultivator and the highest-ranked disciple among them.

Although Ruan Qiong had discussed the matter of the senior brother candidly with Dong Gu, if Liu Xianyang hadn’t come, Dong Gu would have had to take on that role regardless. But since Liu Xianyang had a connection to the Longquan Sword Sect and ranked higher in cultivation, Dong Gu genuinely felt that it would be more appropriate for Liu Xianyang to take the position of senior brother, benefiting the Longquan Sword Sect.

Liu Xianyang leaned forward, rubbing his face, “If senior brother wants to choose someone stable to handle mundane affairs, then the junior brothers and sisters can focus on their cultivation. Do you think I’m suited to be the senior brother?”

Dong Gu replied, “You’re better than me.”

Liu Xianyang shook his head, “That’s not useful.”

Dong Gu sighed, “I understand.”

Dong Gu fell silent for a long time and suddenly said, “Liu Xianyang, I don’t know why, but I’m a bit afraid of you.”

Liu Xianyang nodded, “Is it because I’ve been to the Sword Qi Great Wall and have drawn my sword? Plus, my current realm isn’t deep enough to hide it well.”

Dong Gu immediately understood, and he stopped speaking, rising to take his leave.

Liu Xianyang propped his chin up with one hand, gazing into the distance. If he had already made such an impression with just a few swords, what about him?

The fifth world.

A city broke through the firmament, descending from the sky.

An old scholar watched this scene from afar, feeling both happy and melancholic.

Happy that the Sword Qi Great Wall had left so many seeds of swordsmanship behind, ensuring its legacy would never die. 

Melancholic because the city’s descent reminded him of the fall of the Pearl Cave, which must have looked similar back then.

The scholar remarked, “My swordsmanship truly cannot compare to Chen Qingdu’s.”

The old scholar laughed and scolded, “You’re not even a sword cultivator, just a mere scholar without a degree. If your swordsmanship surpassed Chen Qingdu’s, where would that leave the face of the old Sword Immortal?”

The scholar asked, “Aren’t you going to take a look over there?”

You, a Wensheng, insist on flaunting your scholarly achievements; what sense does that make?

The old scholar scratched his head, muttering that it was probably best to leave it be, though his eyes inadvertently glanced toward the man hailed as the greatest scholar of the realm, and the immortal sword in his hand.

The man helplessly replied, “I’ve established a rule: I do not teach swordsmanship to others. Moreover, the young sword cultivators these years do not require my extra effort. As for this sword in my hand, it will eventually be returned to the Great Xuan Du Temple. Your little schemes won’t work.”

The old scholar stood on tiptoe, casting a glance at the distant city, lamenting, “What a pity that the Zhan Long Cliff has been turned into the foundation for the city by the old Sword Immortal.”

The man asked, “It seemed that the two sages of the Confucian Temple had something to say earlier. What were you whispering to them about?”

The old scholar, puffing out his chest and stroking his beard, replied, “Nothing much, just guiding others in their learning. You see, I have a wealth of knowledge in me; it’s not like some people who stubbornly cling to their swordsmanship, which can be learned at will.”

The man said, “Since you’re not going to the city, then continue to open your door.”

The old scholar suddenly changed his mind, saying, “How about we go drink at my closed-door disciple’s tavern together? I’ll treat you, and you can settle the bill.”

The man shook his head.

In the distance, someone took off on a sword, casually selecting a direction, and the sword light quickly vanished.

They must have been eager to understand the circumstances of this new world.

While flying on his sword, the person had already progressed from the Nascent Soul stage to the upper five realms.

He asked, “Is that Ning Yao?”

The immortal sword in his hand trembled slightly.

The scholar nodded, “It seems she was forcibly suppressed at the Nascent Soul stage due to the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

The old scholar smiled broadly, “My closed-door disciple certainly has good taste! Finding a teacher is this!”

He raised a thumb and then another, “Finding a wife is this!”

After a moment, the sword light in the distance seemed to have already resonated with the principles of this new world, solidifying within the Jade Purity stage. Thus, it swiftly turned the tip of the sword and flew toward the old scholar’s direction.

The immortal sword in the scholar’s hand let out a dragon’s roar.

As if meeting an old friend.

Ning Yao flew on her sword to the mountaintop, landing gracefully before the old scholar.

She offered no words but raised her arm, placing her hand over her forehead, and stammered, “I’m sorry.”

The old scholar was anxious, stamping his feet as he hurried to her side, gently patting her on the head, “Ning girl, what are you sorry for? There’s nothing to apologize for. It’s that Chen Ping’an’s capabilities were insufficient; blame him, blame him! Don’t you feel guilty? If there’s blame to cast, it’s not on Chen Ping’an; let’s all blame Chen Qingdu for it. That old Sword Immortal only knows how to pass burdens to the young. If that doesn't work, then blame me, your incompetent teacher…”

Ning Yao had already regained her composure, lowering her hand and bidding farewell to the Wensheng, wishing him well.

Then she soared away on her sword, continuing to explore the myriad mountains and rivers of this fifth world.

Soon, a host of cultivators from the three worlds would surge in, and there would undoubtedly be many Qi practitioners at a bottleneck in the Nascent Soul stage.

The future circumstances of the Sword Qi Great Wall, aside from sword-fighting, would involve plenty of intrigue. None of that was her forte; in the past, with him by her side, she didn’t need to overthink anything. Now that he was no longer by her side, the schemes and deceptions among people would still not be her strength. But it didn’t matter; in the past, the Sword Qi Great Wall’s sword cultivators lacked sufficient realms and relied on wine to fill the gaps. Now, since my heart feels insufficient, I would fill it with realms!

What circumstances and rules existed in this world, Ning Yao didn’t ask a single word.

The scholar nodded, “Truly worthy of the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, who for millennia have sought no aid from others.”

The old scholar slumped down, “In the end, who can my closed-door disciple seek help from? Me, as his teacher? His senior brother? Just kill me; I’m simply a powerless teacher, feeling so frustrated…”

The scholar asked, “Where to kill?”

The old scholar immediately stood up, brushing off the dust, and coughed, “You, Bai Ye, how can you not take a joke? Change that in the future.”

The scholar transformed into a beam of sword light, continuing to busy himself with opening doors, needing to carve out three routes for the Haoran world, Nan Posa Continent, Fuyou Continent, and the Tongye Continent.

Within the city that had just settled down.

Ning Yao had already broken through on her sword.

She had become the first Jade Purity cultivator of this brand new world.

In the future, she would lead the Hidden Official lineage, consisting of Dong Bu, Luo Zhenyi, Xu Ning, Chang Taiqing, Gu Zhujing, Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, and the latest addition, Fan Dache.

So now, the Hidden Official lineage consisted of only nine people, responsible for monitoring all sword cultivators.

Meanwhile, the Nascent Soul cultivators of Qi Shou would be responsible for rebuilding the Executioner lineage, overseeing laws and killings. Those martial artists hiding in the Summer Palace would also join the Executioner lineage in the future.

Currently, all Golden Elixir and Nascent Soul sword cultivators would automatically be categorized under the Executioner lineage. If they wished to withdraw, they could exchange their military merit afterward. After that, leaving the city and establishing sects would be at their discretion. However, once a city sent out a message via flying sword, any sword cultivators who dared not return would be treated as enemies and executed.

There was also a woman named Nianxin, dressed in a celestial-style robe resembling a fairy’s, seeming to have just recovered from a serious illness. Now a Nascent Soul, she was not a sword cultivator but served as the deputy leader of the Executioner lineage.

Within the city, the Ancestral Hall began construction, with only one portrait hanging—Chen Qingdu.

In addition, many initiatives, like the relocation of clothing boutiques, sword workshops, and alchemy shops, were proceeding step by step, following established protocols, thus everything seemed orderly.

As Ning Yao was the first to leave the city, the remaining eight sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage paired off, selecting different directions to soar beyond the city, needing to draw a geographical map. If they were obstructed along the way, they would immediately send messages back to Qi Shou and Nianxin, who were responsible for the Executioner sword cultivators.

The Gao Ye Marquis was in charge of guarding a personal life lamp, and only a handful of people knew of this matter.

Having fallen from the Jade Purity realm, Nianxin left prison and infiltrated the city, arriving in this world with the hidden official jade token. According to the agreement, she did not immediately return it to the Hidden Official lineage.

According to the young hidden official’s words, she could only show the jade token under two conditions.

If Ning Yao encountered danger.

Or if Chen Xi, who had yet to mature, was usurped by Qi Shou’s Executioner lineage.

Nianxin walked alone to the tavern, which was now without an owner; the main manager had left for the Haoran world, while the second manager remained at the city walls.

The city had only recently settled, and the echoes of the great battle were still fresh in her mind, so there weren’t many customers.

Nianxin ordered a bowl of Jahua Lake wine, drinking alone. Before drinking, she raised the small wine bowl, respectfully toasting a foreigner who appeared to be around her age.

The entire Yu Long Sect was left in confusion.

First, an Inverted Mountain water spirit palace was inexplicably toppled into the sea, causing the Qi practitioners to return to their sects in embarrassment. 

Then, before long, a handsome young man with a sword hanging at his waist appeared atop a rain deity statue in the Yu Long Sect, claiming to be a true demon from the wilderness, asking everyone to kill this beast.

The young man smiled brightly, raising his hands to show his determination to meet his fate, refusing to fight back.

The female leader of the Yu Long Sect, who was also Yun Qian’s senior sister, led all the cultivators from the Ancestral Hall to the mountaintop, looking up at the handsome young man.

One of the Yu Long Sect elders communicated with him telepathically, stating that the Yu Long Sect had a secret pact with the old ancestor of the Fuyou Continent and a former elder affiliated with the borders.

The Inverted Mountain had already ascended.

As long as the Yu Long Sect cultivators weren’t blind, they could see that the Sword Qi Great Wall had been breached, unable to imagine it but also having to admit this fact.

The youngest Earth Immortal in Yu Long Sect’s history, Fu Ke, stood alongside his two celestial partners behind the ancestors of the sect.

The handsome boy who claimed to be a demon casually snapped his fingers, killing the elder of the Yu Long Sect, who was at the Nascent Soul level, on the spot.

After killing the person, the boy smiled, “With such a head of white hair and skin like a chicken, I could only think that you, old lady, had ulterior motives and wanted to scare me to death. Oh right, I forgot to introduce myself. I heard you Haoran world people value this, so let me tell you. My name is Jiu Ye. Because I only have two loves in life: beautiful wine and beautiful women. You Yu Long Sect just so happen to have both, so I came first. This name is new, specially taken for your Haoran world. My previous name was Qie Yun.”

When the Yu Long Sect cultivators heard the name “Qie Yun,” their faces nearly turned ashen.

A great demon of the Throne.

Because the Yu Long Sect had been established for a long time and was close to the Inverted Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, they were well aware of some of the inner workings of the wild world.

For example, the fourteen thrones in the ancient well, aside from the owner of the Moon-Trapping Mountain, the Grand Ancestor of the Wild World, included “Wen Hai” Zhou Mi, the wanderer Liu Cha, Yao Jia, Long Jun, the Lotus Temple Master, Bai Ying, Yang Zhi, Fei Mei, and Huang Luan.

Furthermore, there was a legendary golden-armored general said to be imprisoned by Dao ancestors through Daoist techniques, the Mountain-Moving Monkey with a long staff, a three-headed, six-armed giant, and the one with an ancient thunder spear.

However, what the Yu Long Sect didn’t know was that the Lotus Temple Master had already fallen. The Ascension-stage great demon had been slain by Chen Xi.

As for the other upper five realm and Earth Immortal great demons, many had suffered severe losses over the years in their attempts to breach the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Huang Luan had been slain by A Liang and Yao Chongdao, and Huang Luan’s last contribution to the wild world was sacrificing most of her life to suppress A Liang beneath the Moon-Trapping Mountain.

Thus, the Moon-Trapping Mountain had previously issued orders to all military camps, forbidding any upper five realm demons from pursuing Huang Luan’s rebirth through her life lamp. 

A forcibly reincarnated Huang Luan, in essence, was no different from a child. As for whether cultivators below the upper five realms would be instructed by the great demon to hunt down Huang Luan, that was up to them.

When the time came, would it be a group of Nascent Soul cultivators secretly surrounding and killing Huang Luan, or would a few Nascent Soul sword cultivators participate in the siege? The Moon-Trapping Mountain wouldn’t concern itself with such trivial matters. Since she had lost her realm, she had lost her throne; in the wild world, strength reigned supreme.

However, it was essential that Huang Luan not make it to the gray-cloaked old man to complain.

After the great demon Jiu Ye casually killed, several young cultivators from the Yu Long Sect were filled with despair, angrily shouting for the Ancestor Hall elders to activate the mountain water formations.

However, from the leader of the Yu Long Sect to the elders in the Ancestor Hall, they all turned a blind eye.

The great demon Jiu Ye’s gaze wandered, picking out the female cultivators below the Golden Elixir stage, one by one, skinning them alive, their lives and deaths were of no concern to him.

The Yu Long Sect had self-inflicted wounds, with women killing men. There were those who killed their partners, and those who didn’t kill but helped their partners stop fellow disciples from killing, only to be killed together.

The leader of the Yu Long Sect and the members of the Ancestor Hall killed one man, no more, no less.

Soon, Fu Ke discovered that he was the last man left in the entire Yu Long Sect. His two celestial partners stood resolutely beside him.

Jiu Ye nodded and smiled, “You have two partners; if you kill one, you can live. If any of them commit suicide, it doesn’t count as your doing.”

Before the two women could say anything, Fu Ke had already killed one.

Then Jiu Ye nodded, very pleased, and with a single slap, he knocked that man dead, laughing, “You really believed my words? You’re just foolishly dead.”

One of the female cultivators stared at the bloodied remains of Fu Ke in disbelief. Jiu Ye grabbed her, pulling her in front of him, casually slashing her beautiful face, before tossing the screaming girl away. It wasn’t just skinning; if a face lost its spirit without the soul of the female cultivator attached, it would lose its charm, and when he used it to “make up,” it would be meaningless. He shook the bloody face in his hand, gently blowing away the blood, smiling, “Truly beautiful.”

The leader of the Yu Long Sect trembled as she spoke, “Qie Yun, why? Keeping us alive would be beneficial for you; we could guide you, whether to the Nan Posa Continent or the Tongye Continent, we could lead you in the slaughter…”

Jiu Ye shook his hand, waving the fresh face, interrupting the words of the female cultivator from the Yu Long Sect, as if he had heard the biggest joke, laughing uproariously and pressing a finger to his eye corner, finally managing to stop laughing, “Unfortunately, in our wild world, the lives of ants are the least valuable. You, a bigger ant, if you encountered Yang Zhi or Fei Mei, you might indeed survive, but your luck has run out, as you happen to run into me.”

At this point, he turned to look toward the Inverted Mountain, murmuring with a smile, “Besides, after years of dealing with the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, encountering you old deities…”

Just then, a young girl with two braids punched the great demon Jiu Ye into the sea, creating a massive wave as if a mountain had crashed down into the water.

Before the female cultivators of the Yu Long Sect could have any misconception, the little girl dashed back and forth between two mountains, beating all the Earth Immortals to death.

As for the great demon Jiu Ye, who returned from the sea to the Yu Long Sect, he strolled leisurely, selecting the faces of girls under the Golden Elixir stage, skinning them alive. Their lives and deaths were of no concern to him.

The gray-cloaked old man arrived at the Yu Long Sect’s mountaintop, saying, “Xiao Xun, Qie Yun, committing the act of exterminating an entire sect is something we’ll let slide this time, but don’t let it happen again.”

Even if some people still lived, the Yu Long Sect was essentially done for.

Xiao Xun crossed his arms, remaining silent.

The great demon Qie Yun finally managed to pick out a few relatively intact faces from the sea of bodies, now gathering them together, carefully stitching up his own visage. He bowed to the gray-cloaked old man with a smile, “Understood.”

Xiao Xun said, “If you exchange for military merit, would that not suffice?”

The gray-cloaked old man chuckled, “Of course it can. As long as the merit is sufficient, you can kill at will.”

Xiao Xun suddenly turned to Qie Yun, saying, “Well done!”

The great demon Qie Yun smiled without a word, merely continuing to patch up his face, adding the final touches. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 810: The Girl Asks the River God for a Duel**

Day by day, year by year, the Sword Qi Great Wall stood tall against the elements. At last, the first heavy snowfall arrived.

On the towering cliffs of the wall, a young man’s features became clearer and more distinct. At this moment, he stood at the edge of the castle, donning a bright red robe. Beneath it, a deep sword scar, nearly severing his body and spine, was healing on its own. He had attempted to stealthily leave the Sword Qi Great Wall to confront a surge of demonic forces that had broken through its defenses. He needed something to occupy himself with.

However, he was quickly intercepted by a figure clad in gray robes, appearing as if from thin air. Ultimately, he was struck hard by a sword. Had he not employed a secret technique as a last resort to return to the Great Wall, even if Chen Ping'an was genuinely at the Jade Purity Realm, he would have surely perished.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an faced off against the dragon lord standing atop the opposite wall. They exchanged no words, and the young man turned away, sheathing his sword.

The dragon lord croaked, “Chen Qingdu has left a useless pawn like you here to be a guard dog?”

A figure arrived on a flying sword, chuckling, “How pitiful. I honestly can’t tell if you’re here to guard the Sword Qi Great Wall or to keep watch over our barbaric realm!”

The figure in red merely walked away, growing increasingly distant.

In the mural city, near the portrait of the inkstone goddess, Pei Qian found a small shop selling copies and sketches of the goddess Tian Guan. With eight blessings already lost, the shop's business was rather mediocre, resembling the situation of her family’s New Year’s shop back in Qi Long Lane.

The shopkeeper was a pretty young woman. Although her master had mentioned she wasn’t a practitioner of the Pima Sect, she was a rare celestial couple with Pang Lanxi.

Pei Qian felt a flicker of worry. Pang Lanxi was a mountain sword cultivator known for retaining youth, while the woman below the mountain would inevitably age year by year. Even with elixirs and miraculous medicines, there would come a day when she would be gray-haired. What would happen then? Even if the two remained together for eternity, Pang Lanxi wouldn’t mind, but her heart would surely ache in silence.

Pei Qian scratched her head, contemplating whether she should remember the shopkeeper's face and have the old cook craft a likeness. Yet she worried that it might be unnecessary. She sighed, wishing her master were around.

The five goddesses—Treasure Canopy, Spirit Mushroom, Spring Officer, Changqing, and the goddess known as the Celestial Staff—had transformed from colored murals to simple sketches before her master had last visited the mural city. After her master went to the Ghostly Maw Valley, the three goddesses—Inkstone, Rainwalker, and Deer Rider—had chosen their respective masters. At that time, Pei Qian and Zhou Mili had protested, wondering what was wrong with the three goddesses. Weren't they getting old and losing their eyesight? However, Pei Qian noticed that her master had a relieved expression, smiling happily.

Pei Qian had come here merely for some excitement. Unless she sold her pots and pans, she could never afford the goddesses’ paintings.

As for Li Huai, he was even less fortunate—a complete pauper, without a single celestial coin to his name. He was just a drifter, following the helmsman to eat and drink.

It didn’t matter. Pei Qian planned to do some small business here. Before descending the mountain, she had made arrangements with the wealth god of the Pima Sect, Wei Yusong. The senior had agreed that if she and Li Huai operated a small stall in the mural city, they wouldn’t have to pay any fees to the Pima Sect.

After bidding farewell to the gentle and lovely shopkeeper, Pei Qian took Li Huai to a crowded area, finding an open space. She took down a bamboo box and pulled out a prepared piece of cloth, laying it on the ground. She placed two yellow paper talismans on the cloth and shot a glance at Li Huai, who instantly understood the opportunity had come for him to make amends.

The crisis of Pei Qian setting him up was averted—good news indeed! So he quickly took out a celestial porcelain brush-washing basin from the bamboo box and placed it on the cloth first. He then went to retrieve the other three items. The two had split the spoils evenly; besides this basin, Li Huai had also received a piece of paper resembling the ancient style of the Falling Sunset zither and a green-glazed bowl embossed with a dragon pattern. The remaining items—a fox praying to the moon painting, a writing desk box with a pair of three-colored lions, and a drunken inkstone held by a celestial being—were all kept by Pei Qian. She planned to gift them later: the inkstone was for her master, as he was a scholar who enjoyed drinking. As for the moon-painting, she would give it to Xiao Mi Li, and the writing desk box was for Sister Nuan Shu, who was our little housekeeper and accountant, and it would come in handy for her.

As for the large stack of talisman paper and the red string, Pei Qian took a significant number of talisman papers, while Li Huai obediently put away the red thread, which Pei Qian had scorned and he actually disliked even more. What did a grown man need that for?

Unexpectedly, Pei Qian shot a glare at Li Huai and snapped, “Are you stupid? Do we look like people from a wealthy family? If you whip out so many treasures at once, who’s going to believe us? Should we stick a ‘definitely fake’ label on our foreheads? Two talismans and one porcelain basin is enough!”

In the end, Pei Qian and Li Huai squatted behind their cloth stall, which actually only sold two items: two rather dubious talismans and one porcelain brush-washing basin.

Most of the passersby merely glanced at the talismans and basin before moving on.

Li Huai quietly asked, “Should I help shout a few words to attract customers?”

“What’s the rush? You’re not cut out for this kind of business,” Pei Qian replied, hands tucked in her sleeves as she squatted on the ground with a sneer. “We actually need help, but selling this kind of unregistered, pop-up stall is similar to peddling medicine in the streets. There aren’t as many connections as a regular business, but still, if we had more people, we could spread some flyers to attract customers and then, when there’s a crowd, we need someone to negotiate the terms. If anyone suspects we’re selling fakes, we’ll need to quickly clear up their doubts with our words. Moreover, the person taking the lead should dress well and speak like a wealthy person, intentionally keeping their distance from others, and then loudly proclaim they want to buy everything... Forget it, discussing this is pointless. You’re my only idiot here, and if you try to help, you’ll only make things worse. Just watch and learn; your only contribution is your accent. I’ll explain the details later.”

Pei Qian paused, her expression complex, and softly said, “The most impressive ones can handle everything by themselves; that’s the true talent in the world. They can go anywhere without starving and can earn big money. But such people are rare, and I’ve only heard of them, never seen one. They have strict rules to abide by, such as never earning from someone’s misfortune. For example, if someone who has been cheated had originally ten taels of silver, they would definitely leave at least one or two taels behind. Beyond these old rules, there’s profound wisdom. Once you leave a way out for someone, they usually won’t harbor too much resentment and won’t end up as lifelong enemies. But such people are few and far between. I’ve only heard of them, never met one.”

Li Huai sighed, “Pei Qian, you know so much about these underworld businesses.”

Back on Falling Star Mountain, Pei Qian wasn’t like this.

Now that she was in the rivers and lakes, she seemed to be in her element, well-versed in all the rules and ways.

Pei Qian remained silent for a long time. “It’s nothing. I liked to blend in when I was young; I’ve just seen a lot. Also, don’t misunderstand, when I traveled with my master in the rivers and lakes, I didn’t pay attention to these things, nor did I engage in them.”

Back in the small rivers and lakes of Nanyuan Kingdom’s capital city, one couldn’t survive just by attending weddings and funerals.

Later, after following her master, she no longer had to worry about food and clothing. She could look forward to what delicious items she could eat next, even if her master didn’t approve. After all, the master and disciple had money, and it was clean money.

Pei Qian said to Li Huai, “Remember, these two talismans—we’ll sell them for the price of one small summer coin and say it’s your ancestral treasure talisman passed down through your sect, an exceptional offensive magical tool! After your master passed away, it was handed down to you as the only heir because you urgently needed money to try your luck at the Haiguzhuan market. Otherwise, you wouldn’t sell it even if you were beaten to death. Anyone who wants to haggle with us, just ignore them. You can just shake your head and say you’re not selling. If we really can’t sell it, as for that porcelain basin, we’ll only sell it if they buy the talismans. It’s not worth even one snowflake coin, so we can give it away for free.”

Li Huai glanced at the two talismans and said, “These two shabby talismans are priced at one small summer coin? Even a fool wouldn’t buy that! Plus, we spent a solid ten snowflake coins on this basin.”

Pei Qian was surveying the surrounding tourists, sneering, “You’re even dumber than a fool. This basin was priced at ten snowflake coins at the Xu Hen Fang, and even if we got ripped off, we’d still get at least four or five snowflake coins for it. I deliberately said it’s not worth even one snowflake coin to make it seem like we’re being taken advantage of, so having this basin makes it easier for people to get a bargain. The key is to support the two talismans. Unless someone’s truly an expert, they’ll be even more uncertain about the quality of the talismans. At that point, there will surely be someone who pretends to disdain it, then comes back. By the third time, I’ll start to persuade you, and you can hesitate and mumble something like ‘I’m sorry to my master’ or something like that.”

Li Huai said gloomily, “Why is it that if my master has passed, you can pretend to be my hometown friend?”

Pei Qian angrily picked up her walking stick, causing Li Huai to roll away in fright. When Li Huai cautiously made his way back to squat down, Pei Qian was furious, “You idiot! I really have a master, but what about you, Li Huai?!”

“If you speak in the dialect of North Ju Lu Prefecture, you can now pretend to be a local who left home at a young age. A person of such a young age who can take the ferry across to return to their hometown, carrying a few treasures, isn’t that normal? Even if it’s just a few dozen snowflake coins worth of business, it shouldn’t attract the attention of the gods on the mountain. If there are any, we wouldn’t be afraid since this is Pima Sect's territory. If it’s those people from the rivers and lakes, and if I can’t beat them, we can just run.”

Half an hour passed, and Li Huai’s legs were getting sore from squatting, so he had to sit on the ground. Meanwhile, Pei Qian remained squatting, motionless.

Many passersby would glance at the talismans or basin and then walk away.

Li Huai felt that today’s dealings with Pei Qian at the stall were precarious. He felt increasingly guilty; if it weren’t for his reckless purchases at the ferry, Pei Qian wouldn’t have to work so hard.

Pei Qian said, “Let’s wait another half an hour. If it still doesn’t work, we’ll leave. My master said there’s no such thing as a good stall in this world. It’s normal if we can’t sell anything.”

Another half an hour passed, and Li Huai could only silently recite prayers for luck.

An old cultivator in a high-crowned white robe glanced at the stall and walked a few steps away before stopping. He squatted down by the cloth and reached out to grab a yellow paper talisman. Pei Qian quickly bent down and blocked the talisman with her hand, shaking her head, “You can’t touch it. Only look. Senior, you mountain gods are all quite strange with your methods. We harbor no ill intentions, but we must be cautious. Forgive me, senior.”

The old man smiled and nodded, casually picking up the porcelain brush-washing basin. This time, Pei Qian did not stop him, and she repeated her earlier explanation about Li Huai. The old man, listening to Pei Qian’s words, seemed absent-minded. He shook the basin in his hand and lightly tossed it back onto the cloth, pointing to the two yellow paper talismans while asking with a smile, “How much for these two?”

The old man was accompanied by a pair of young men and women, both carrying swords, with the unusual detail that their golden sword tassels had a single white pearl dangling from them.

Pei Qian replied, “One small summer coin, not a single snowflake coin less. This is a talisman that concerns my friend’s life; it cannot be undervalued. If you buy the talismans, the basin is a complimentary gift, a gesture of friendship.”

Li Huai’s expression was tense as he stood by.

Seeing Pei Qian speak like this, beads of sweat began to form on her forehead. Was she pretending not to be from the rivers and lakes, putting on a show of streetwise bravado?

The old cultivator asked, “Will you sell for fifty snowflake coins?”

Pei Qian countered, “Senior, I’ve never seen anyone conduct business like this. If I were to split the basin in half and offer you one half, would you buy it?”

The old cultivator was momentarily taken aback, laughing.

He said, “One small summer coin? Alright, I’ll buy it.”

Pei Qian suddenly said, “I’m not selling it anymore.”

The old cultivator looked up and asked with a smile, “Why is that? Are you trying to raise the price, or do you genuinely not want to sell?”

Pei Qian replied, “I genuinely don’t want to sell.”

The old cultivator chuckled, “I was too generous, and you feel like you’re losing out on the talismans?”

Pei Qian nodded.

The old cultivator stood up and walked away.

Li Huai moved closer to Pei Qian, “Pei Qian, Pei the Great Helmsman, what was that about?”

Pei Qian raised her chin, nodding at the porcelain basin, “He was actually after the basin. Besides, he’s an outsider; no matter how well he speaks the dialect of North Ju Lu Prefecture, there would still be some mispronunciations. A true cultivator from North Ju Lu wouldn’t speak like that. Such outsiders who travel across regions wouldn’t be short on celestial coins. Of course, we’re the exception. He wouldn’t be joking around with us; he truly wanted to buy the basin.”

Li Huai asked curiously, “Regardless of what he was after, as long as we sell it for one small summer coin, wouldn’t we have made back all the celestial coins we lost to Xu Hen Fang?”

Pei Qian put away the stall, returning the basin to Li Huai, confidently stating, “What’s the rush? Let’s pack up and leave; we’ll walk slowly toward the mural city. They’ll definitely come looking for us. I’ll think of a better price on the way. If it doesn’t sell, it’s no big deal. I can confidently say that porcelain basin is worth a small summer coin. It will eventually be ours.”

Li Huai wrapped the basin up and put it in his bamboo box, feeling sorrowful, “Pei Qian, you’re so clever. One day when you’re short on money, you won’t sell me off, will you?”

Pei Qian replied nonchalantly, “Doing business is business, and making friends is making friends. They’re two different things. Besides, you’re not only my friend but someone my master has looked after for so long. Outside of Falling Star Mountain, I, Pei Qian, would dare to sell anyone for money, but I will never sell you.”

Li Huai laughed.

Pei Qian shot him a glance, “What’s so funny?”

Pei Qian and Li Huai walked toward the entrance of the mural city, and Pei Qian reminded him, “Some illicit money is earned by gambling with your life. But how many times can a person’s luck beat heaven? Of course, when it comes down to it, you can’t care about anything else. However, as a stall, we shouldn’t engage in illicit dealings, nor earn money from misfortune. Li Huai got cheated out of a wooden plaque by Xu Hen Fang, and I, Pei Qian, am going to earn back a small summer coin through my own efforts.”

Li Huai scratched his head. The helmsman’s little ledger had reemerged in the world.

Li Huai started to change the subject, “Have you thought of a price yet?”

“I’ve thought of it. One grain of millet coin,” Pei Qian replied.

Li Huai was left speechless. Is our business too greedy?

Pei Qian said, “This is no longer the previous stall and we can now name our price. Based on the old man’s temperament, just looking at the two young men and women beside him gives me a clue. Earlier, when I was haggling with the old man, those two merely thought it was... interesting. Their gazes were very earnest; like attracts like, so the old man can’t be too bad. If he were truly a cunning and insidious person, I could only blame my judgment for being poor and for us being here in this mural city to run a stall, or for us being in the rivers and lakes of North Ju Lu Prefecture.”

Li Huai laughed, “I won’t blame such trivial matters.”

Pei Qian nodded, “That’s why I brought you along to navigate the rivers and lakes with me.”

Li Huai clasped his fists and sidestepped, “Thank you for your wisdom, Great Helmsman.”

Pei Qian said, “Scram.”

Li Huai chuckled, saying “Understood,” and walked alongside Pei Qian.

Pei Qian said, “The rivers and lakes are deep; if there ever is danger, remember not to hesitate when it’s time for you to leave alone.”

Li Huai remained silent.

Pei Qian had said she was a Sixth Realm Martial Artist, which Li Huai thought was fine. Years ago, on the way to study, Yu Lu was younger than Pei Qian is now, yet he had already reached the Sixth Realm. Shortly after entering the academy, to settle a score, Yu Lu advanced to the Seventh Realm. After studying for many years at the academy and occasionally accompanying his teachers on journeys, he had little opportunity to interact with people from the rivers and lakes. So, Li Huai had little concept of the Sixth and Seventh Realms. Moreover, since Pei Qian said she was at the Sixth Realm, she had never truly fought anyone, and opportunities to spar with peers had been few. So, to be cautious, he decided to discount her strength and consider Pei Qian as Fifth Realm in the rivers and lakes.

Li Huai muttered, “That won’t happen. Zheng Dafeng always says I’m a lucky one; I don’t even step in dog poop when I go out, so our luck in the rivers and lakes can’t be that bad.”

Suddenly, Li Huai’s smile brightened as he lifted his bamboo box, “Look, the porcelain basin in my box proves it, doesn’t it?”

Pei Qian asked, “Are you really happy every time you step in dog poop?”

Li Huai had no words to respond.

With a bit of a bite, he said softly, “Pei Qian, let’s discuss something. Can we not sell the porcelain basin? I want to give it to my sister. She’s currently serving as an uncredited outer disciple for the old immortal at Lion Peak. In reality, she’s just working as a maid. My mother and sister feel quite ashamed to admit it. We’re poor at home, and my sister definitely didn’t give a proper apprenticeship gift back then. She’s been good to me. My mother has always favored me since I was little, and my sister never gets angry...”

Li Huai had prepared himself for a beating from Pei Qian.

Unexpectedly, Pei Qian said, “Alright, alright. Of course, you can keep it. That porcelain basin was always yours anyway. Even if it sold for one grain of millet coin, I wouldn’t take a single copper coin. If you’re willing, why should I stop you?”

Li Huai was caught off guard, about to speak, but Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “Scram.”

Li Huai laughed, “Alright then.”

Li Huai fell silent for a moment, “Why?”

Pei Qian recalled a trivial matter from her childhood, back when she was in the Riverbank Green House.

Some things, some items, were never merely about money.

Pei Qian didn’t say anything else to Li Huai.

Sure enough, after a moment, Pei Qian and Li Huai waited at the entrance of the mural city, and the old man returned.

Pei Qian clasped her fists in a bow, “Senior, I apologize, but I won’t be selling the basin anymore.”

The old cultivator looked at the clear-eyed girl and found it somewhat strange, yet he still nodded, saying playfully, “Little girl, whether the talismans are worth anything, we both know. However, that basin truly can fetch three to five small summer coins. The value lies not in the porcelain but in the inscriptions on the bottom; those few characters are very valuable. In the future, if you and your friend run a stall again, don’t undervalue it. And be careful of ill intentions from others. It’s best to sell such things at places like the mural city, Dragon Palace Caves, or Spring Dew Garden. Excluding the ferry expenses, you’ll definitely make a profit.”

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment and smiled, asking, “May I ask your name, senior, and your sect? We’d like to pay a visit if we have the chance.”

The old cultivator waved his hand with a smile, jokingly saying, “It’s a chance encounter in the rivers and lakes; do not inquire about names. If fate allows, we shall meet again. Besides, little girl, didn’t you already guess my identity as an outsider from another continent?”

Pei Qian looked at the old man, suddenly cupping her fists, and spoke solemnly, “Martial Artist Pei Qian, bidding farewell to you, senior!”

The old man was taken aback for a moment before bursting into laughter, “Good!”

Li Huai watched Pei Qian, who seemed somewhat unfamiliar at this moment, with a mix of envy and admiration.

The old cultivator, along with the two disciples, ascended the Pima Sect’s ancestral mountain, taking a brief rest at the Hanging Sword Pavilion on the mountainside.

The old cultivator smiled, “Feel free to ask any questions.”

One of the young women asked, “Master, was that girl a pure martial artist? What realm is she at?”

The old cultivator thought for a moment, stroked his beard, and smiled, gazing at the gently swaying river below, saying only two words, seemingly unresponsive, “Strange. All strange.”

Wei Yusong personally arrived at the Hanging Sword Pavilion, clasping his fists with a smile, “Welcome, Master Nalan, to our sect. The sect leader is in Qinglu Town, and Yan Su is instructing his direct disciple Pang Lanxi in the remains of the goddess’s painting. He couldn’t make it. As for the other one, once they hear Master Nalan has arrived, even if they reach the base of the mountain, they will likely turn back.”

The old man chuckled, “It’s all fine as long as you don’t talk to me about money; I don’t have any.”

Wei Yusong responded, “Oh, then I’ll take my leave.”

The old man waved his hand, “Don’t be in a hurry; sit down and chat for a while. This place has beautiful scenery, and it can make one forget about money.”

Wei Yusong sat down with a smile, and the two young men and women bowed to the sect’s wealth god, Wei Yusong returning their gestures.

The old man asked, “I saw a girl holding a walking stick and carrying a bamboo box, named Pei Qian. I’m not sure if it’s true, but it’s most likely real, right?”

Wei Yusong laughed, “Yes, her name is indeed Pei Qian. She’s our Zhu Sect leader’s newly recognized goddaughter.”

The old man smiled, “No wonder.”

Within the territory of Haiguzhuan, there was a river running north to south, with no branches or tributaries—a rarity in the vast world.

Pei Qian planned to visit the temple of the River God Xue after her master had mentioned that this river god had once helped him. Although he hadn’t paid attention at the time, this river god, alongside the fire god in a certain city, was a true water deity. Anyone passing by should burn incense and pay their respects, regardless of whether it was the mountain’s secret incense.

Pei Qian wouldn’t announce her name and only intended to quietly burn incense at the temple. Strictly speaking, the temple of the River God had always been a lewd place, as it had never been officially recognized by any dynasty or appointed by the Confucian academy.

Approximately six hundred miles from the River God’s temple, with Li Huai by her side, they set off.

After burning incense at the River God’s temple, heading north along the river would lead them to the entrance of the Ghostly Maw Valley. Pei Qian planned to take a distant glance, while the Naheguan marketplace could be explored with Li Huai.

Li Huai began to think about the alluring goddesses’ images he had seen in the mural city. They were truly beautiful—much more so than his sister. No wonder they were considered goddesses in paintings. If only he had the money, he would definitely buy a set, dividing it into two gifts: one for the old man in the drugstore and the other for Zheng Dafeng, who once carried him around. It would be nice for the two bachelors to indulge their eyes.

The surface of the gently undulating river was wide, giving the impression of a lake, with no ferry bridge in sight. The river was rich in water transport, and on Pei Qian’s path, there were two roads—one quiet and close to the river, while the main road bustled with traffic. Pei Qian and Li Huai held their walking sticks, walking along the quiet road, and according to her master’s words, they would soon encounter a riverside tea house. Three bowls of dark tea would start at the price of one snowflake coin, and the shopkeeper was a lazy man, while the young assistant had a bad temperament. Overall, the people weren’t bad, but it was still wise to be cautious when out and about.

Pei Qian looked up at the distant horizon, seeing the colorful sea of clouds. That was likely the so-called auspicious phenomenon. Below the cloud sea, there should be the temple of the River God.

Pei Qian casually asked, “Li Huai, do you see the clouds over there?”

Li Huai nodded in response, “I see it—a large patch of colorful auspicious clouds. I’m a proper student of the academy, of course, I know this is a manifestation of a deity’s merit.”

Pei Qian glanced at Li Huai.

Li Huai asked, “What?”

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment before quietly asking, “Have you become a Qi Practitioner?”

Li Huai chuckled, “I wish! Learning from Lin Mutou and the others, being able to come and go in the wind is quite divine.”

That was referring to Lin Shouyi. Thank you.

Pei Qian thought for a moment but ultimately didn’t take a closer look at Li Huai.

Her master had advised her that the more he was not around, the more she, as the first disciple, needed to follow the rules—like copying books.

Li Huai said, “Pei Qian, when are you going to teach me that crazy sword technique you used back in the academy?”

Pei Qian’s face darkened, “I don’t know any crazy sword technique.”

Li Huai muttered, “If you don’t want to teach, just say so. You’re so stingy. Liu Guan and Ma Lian have been envious of that sword technique for many years; it’s really disheartening for the soldiers.”

Pei Qian ignored him.

She wondered how Chen Lingjun was faring on his journey.

In fact, when Chen Lingjun arrived at Haiguzhuan, he didn’t dare to wander. Except for the mural city at the foot of the mountain, he avoided the River God’s Temple and Ghostly Maw Valley, keeping his distance. He realized he was somewhat isolated in North Ju Lu Prefecture. So, he headed straight to the Pima Sect’s Mu Yi Mountain. Of course, when he left the mountain, he found he had quite a powerful backing, that being Sect Leader Zhu Quan. This Zhu Ayi wasn’t particularly stunning, but she was enthusiastic. As for Chen Lingjun now, he had become somewhat sneaky, carefully bypassing the Chong Xuan Bureau’s Yunxiao Palace, continuing westward until he finally began to truly navigate the rivers, ultimately returning near the Spring Dew Garden by the estuary of the Great Lu River.

There were in fact two estuaries leading to the sea; the strangeness of the Great Lu River far surpassed the winding river beside Pei Qian.

Her master had never lied; there was indeed a riverside tea stall selling dark tea, and there were quite a few customers.

Pei Qian hesitated, conflicted about whether to indulge this time. Before she had left, the old cook had given her a small summer coin and several hundred snowflake coins, saying they were celestial coins meant to attract fortune. Every disciple of Falling Star Mountain received some money upon leaving, but Pei Qian hadn’t dared to ask for more and only took five snowflake coins. Unlike the celestial coins that had previously fallen into her pocket, each of these had a name and were recorded in her little “ancestor hall.” Since these five snowflake coins hadn’t settled in her possession, they were nameless and not counted as leaving home, allowing her to spend them without too much heartache. Thus, Pei Qian said to Li Huai, “I’ll buy you a bowl of dark tea.”

Li Huai replied, “Forget it; that’s too expensive.”

Pei Qian said, “Then you can just watch me drink three bowls.”

Li Huai had no choice but to accompany Pei Qian to sit down. Pei Qian handed over one snowflake coin, and the young assistant brought over three bowls of the river’s famous dark tea—after all, it was the tea often served to guests by the Pima Sect and was quite affordable.

Li Huai took one of the bowls, feeling as though every sip was made of gold and silver, savoring it slowly while feeling a bit pained.

Pei Qian finished one bowl in just two or three sips and took her time with the second bowl.

Pei Qian turned to gaze at the gently flowing river, lost in thought.

Having just arrived in North Ju Lu Prefecture, she was already missing Falling Star Mountain.

After enjoying the dark tea, they continued their journey.

After walking for several dozen miles, Pei Qian asked, “Li Huai, don’t you feel tired from walking?”

Li Huai, using his walking stick to brush past the reeds, laughed heartily, “What a joke! Among those who traveled to the Great Sui for education, I was the youngest, most able to endure hardships, and the least to complain!”

Pei Qian thought about it and decided to let him be.

Both of them had been accustomed to wandering through the mountains and rivers since childhood, so it was quite natural for them to camp out by the riverbank.

Finally, they arrived at the bustling River God’s Temple. Pei Qian and Li Huai spent some money to buy three sticks of ordinary incense, burning them outside the main hall. They saw the golden-armored statue of the River God holding swords in both hands, standing tall and imposing.

The River God’s golden statue was remarkably high, surpassing even the statue of the water goddess from Pei Qian’s hometown by three feet and an inch and a half.

Pei Qian had always had a good memory. After seeing all the people, events, and scenery, she didn’t forget them; when she thought of them, they would come back clearly.

The River God’s Temple was bustling with people, and visitors were everywhere. Pei Qian and Li Huai were quite inconspicuous among the crowds. After stepping out of the main hall, they continued walking; the temple grounds were vast, with many halls to explore. Pei Qian frowned slightly along the way, urging Li Huai to catch up quickly. Then, she used her walking stick to clear a path, positioning herself between a stout young man and an elderly man. The elder was telling a little girl stories about the River God’s Temple. The young man, having been bumped by Pei Qian’s green bamboo walking stick, didn’t feel pain but lost his chance to flirt. Seeing the thin girl standing between the elder and himself, he smiled and stepped in front of the old man.

Pei Qian stepped forward and lightly bumped the young man’s shoulder.

The young man stumbled back several steps, grinning at the girl, “Are we comrades in the same path?”

He walked forward slowly, the girl holding the green bamboo stick and carrying a bamboo box seemed to walk alongside him.

Pei Qian quietly said, “You just stole a bag of silver coins from a wealthy man. Looking at the old man, judging by his dusty appearance and the wear on his boots, it’s clear that what little money he has left is likely just enough for him and his granddaughter to return home after burning incense and making wishes. You really dare to rob him?”

The young man laughed, “What’s it to you? Can you stop me? Since we’re fellow travelers, you should know that I can set up shop here because I have backing. Do you think you can make it ten miles beyond the River God’s Temple? Do you know why the fish in this river are so big? They feast on people!”

Pei Qian continued, “From the way you handle things, you can steal in front of others; you clearly aren’t short on money. Even if you don’t accumulate virtue by being charitable, stealing gold and silver jewelry from the rich is one thing, but you can’t be so wicked as to steal wealth that might cost lives, can you?”

The young man replied, “Are you determined to ruin my good fortune?”

“Ruin your good fortune? You’re sneaking and scurrying, and you can’t even discern right from wrong?” 

Then Pei Qian added, “Above your head, there are deities. Be careful that the River God Xue really gets angry.”

The young man snorted, “We’ll see. I’ll wait for you outside; I’ll see just how long you can hide here.”

Pei Qian nodded, “Go ahead and try.”

Li Huai was completely baffled, following Pei Qian.

Seeing the confident young man turn away with a sneer, Pei Qian reminded him, “Once you enter a temple to burn incense, try not to backtrack.”

The young man spat and quickly left.

Li Huai asked, “A petty thief?”

Pei Qian nodded, “Young but quite experienced.”

Li Huai worriedly said, “It seems that guy is planning to block us. What do we do? Is there a side door in this River God’s Temple we can use?”

Pei Qian shook her head, “Don’t worry; he wouldn’t dare cause trouble right at the temple entrance. He’ll choose a secluded spot along the river to make his move. We can just avoid the riverside path and take the main road.”

In the back hall, there was a couplet with black background and golden characters, the words of which her master had engraved onto bamboo slips. Previously, while drying the slips, Pei Qian had seen it.

“Those with sincere hearts should not bow down; they will have the protection of hidden virtue. Those who do evil while burning incense will only provoke the River God’s wrath.”

Pei Qian clasped her hands together, silently reciting.

Li Huai stood beside her, finding the couplet amusing. No wonder Pei Qian had warned that young thief to be cautious of the River God’s wrath.

After leaving the River God’s Temple, everything went smoothly, and they reached the ferry before nightfall. According to custom, the ferrymen would not ferry anyone across the river at night, saying it would disturb the River God’s rest. This custom had been passed down for generations, and the newer generations followed suit.

Those seeking medical treatment, scholars rushing for examinations, and people contemplating suicide by jumping into the river were all exempted from paying the ferry fee. The first group was not to be charged, as it would damage their virtue. The second group was to accumulate incense offerings. And for the last group, the ferryman dared not take their money.

Pei Qian squinted.

They were here.

Pei Qian spotted a group of people in the distance, appearing to be lying in wait. Among them, the young man was pointing them out, and a group of seven or eight young men approached with quick strides, one of them tall and sturdy, cracking his knuckles ominously.

They looked quite intimidating.

Pei Qian said to Li Huai, “Stay behind me.”

Li Huai asked, “Can’t we smooth things over with an apology and some money?”

Pei Qian replied, “That won’t work. In the rivers and lakes, face matters more than money. Face is worth more than money, and it’s not just about appearances; often, it can genuinely be exchanged for money. Besides, this is not something we can simply smooth over; it’s not a matter of money.”

Li Huai asked, “What can I do then?”

Pei Qian said, “If I can’t beat them, you can claim to be a student from Yongjin Academy. They probably won’t believe you, but if they start hitting you, they will likely hold back, fearing they might kill you.”

Li Huai said, “Just be careful. If it gets too painful, I’ll step in for you.”

This turmoil actually stemmed from Pei Qian’s meddling, but Li Huai wouldn’t think that or blame her.

The group surrounded Pei Qian and Li Huai, and the young man incited, “This little girl doesn’t know the heights of heaven or depths of the earth. Not only did she ruin a big deal for me at the River God’s Temple, which could have netted me at least twenty taels of silver, but after I reported our gang, I expected her to be sensible. Instead, she threatened to take us all on, claiming she’s skilled in the martial arts and isn’t afraid of our weak techniques.”

The leading man pushed the clever young man aside and smiled at the girl, “Little girl, are your martial arts really that impressive?”

At Haiguzhuan, the Ruining River had always seen many deities and extraordinary individuals pass through.

But these two carrying bamboo boxes? Forget it.

Pei Qian shook her head, “Not at all impressive.”

She then added, “But if you want to spar, I’ll oblige.” 

The crowd erupted in laughter. 

This thin little girl seemed not quite right in the head.

The man stepped forward, boots muddied, kicking up dust as he aimed a punch at the girl’s face. Given the girl’s lack of beauty, it was no wonder the man showed no mercy.

Pei Qian remained motionless, allowing the punch to land.

The man retracted his hand and nodded, “I’m not someone who disregards the rules of the rivers and lakes. I’ll just give you a little lesson. Don’t meddle in other people’s business in the future.” 

With a wave of his hand, he called for the others to leave.

Those who had just started cheering were now baffled by the leader’s actions. The young man, having failed to see the black-haired girl on the ground, was thoroughly disappointed and confused about what his leader was up to today.

After walking a few dozen paces, the young man mustered his courage to ask, “Big brother?”

The man was drenched in sweat, clutching his right wrist with his left hand, trembling in pain and full of agony, “You met a hard nut to crack. My hand... my hand is broken. You wait!”

The young man cried out in despair.

In a flash, the girl with the bamboo box had blocked their way, leaning on her walking stick as she spoke firmly to the man, “Every family has its own rules, and every villain has their own way. I don’t know what the customs are like in Haiguzhuan, but stealing is not allowed within the temple. That’s how it’s always been in my hometown; otherwise, one would end up living a life half as long as others. First, your man was stealing money that could cost lives at the River God’s Temple, and now you throw a punch. If it were a normal girl, one punch could injure her, not to mention ruin her looks. Your punch was even more out of line. Even in a sparring match between martial artists, the first punch should never be that ruthless. It’s not just about the skill in your strikes; the key lies in your heart.”

Pei Qian nodded to herself, “Alright, I’ve figured it all out. I can proceed with the punch now.”

An old ferryman, stout and dark-skinned, had quietly appeared nearby, smiling, “Little girl, take care when you strike; be mindful not to kill someone. While there may be little law here in Haiguzhuan, it is still under the watchful eyes of the River God. Creating a commotion could lead to trouble.”

Pei Qian turned to the old man, frowning, “Are you siding with the weak and not questioning the reason?”

The old ferryman waved his hand, “I’m not stopping you from striking; I’m just reminding you to take it easy.”

Pei Qian questioned, “That sounds reasonable, but why don’t you manage them first before telling me?”

The old ferryman grinned, “Oh, you’re sounding pretty resentful. What? Do you want to ask this old ferryman to take a swing? I’m just a boatman; what can I manage? Little girl, I’m old and can’t take even one or two punches from you.”

Pei Qian said to the man with a broken wrist, “Get lost. If I catch you committing the same evil again, I’ll return the favor next time.”

The group took off running.

They were terrified because the old ferryman and the girl looked like they were about to engage in a celestial duel.

The old ferryman was ready to leave.

Pei Qian muttered, “My master can’t be wrong; he never will! It’s you, Xue Yuansheng, who misjudged my master!”

Pei Qian took down her box and threw the walking stick to Li Huai, shouting, “River God Xue Yuansheng, you stop right there!”

When she was young, she had wandered the streets daily, only resting when she was too hungry to walk. She had seen many “small matters”—scams for life-saving money, fake medicines that had killed those who could have survived, the abduction of children left alone in the streets of the capital, leading them to live in luxury for a few months before they would run away to return to their old lives, even if they couldn’t find their original “master” again. They would con those small households of their entire savings for dowries, and upon receiving the money, they would flee. If they were caught, they would seek death or simply resolve to continue their nefarious acts...

But back in the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom, there had truly been no deities in the mountains or waters, and the government didn’t manage anything either. But here, in the territory of the River God Xue Yuansheng, how could he not see anything? How could he not manage anything?!

The old ferryman was slightly taken aback. To think a young martial artist would see through his disguise. The old man stopped and turned to the girl, smiling, “Little girl, your martial arts must be extraordinary. You must come from a celestial or noble family. However, in the matters of the rivers and lakes, especially those related to the supernatural and the consequences of actions, you might not understand. The complexities of human affairs are not simply black and white.”

Pei Qian remained silent, slowly rolling up her sleeves.

Li Huai suddenly said, “Xue River God, she might not know everything, but she definitely knows more than you think. I kindly ask you to speak reasonably; let’s take our time and discuss.”

Li Huai’s smile brightened, “After all, the River God doesn’t like to meddle in affairs. There’s no reason to be overly concerned.”

The old ferryman wasn’t angered at all; however, he didn’t want to explain the intricacies of the underworld to the two kids. He laughed and said, “To meddle in others’ affairs comes with a price. That group will likely become more restrained in the future. As for you, little girl, you’ve got reason and strength, which is what you deserve. If you think I, the River God of the Waving River, am unfair in handling matters... Fine, I’ll stand here and take one punch from you. Afterward, I’ll see if you have the patience to continue reasoning with me. If so, I won’t charge you a cent; I’ll ferry you across the river, and we can talk at length.”

Pei Qian’s expression remained cold, her eyes devoid of warmth as she fixed them on the River God, “Xue Yuansheng, you think it’s just a matter of ‘I’ve seen enough, let’s just leave it at that,’ don’t you?!”

Li Huai softly warned Pei Qian, “Pei Qian, don’t go to extremes. Chen Ping'an wouldn’t act like this.”

Pei Qian was inexplicably enraged, her aura surging like a waterfall, even causing the nearby Waving River to ripple, crashing against the banks. The distant boats swayed violently.

Xue Yuansheng had to immediately channel his divine powers to suppress the nearby waters, while the many spirits in the Waving River seemed to be subdued, diving to the riverbed.

She gritted her teeth, “So in this world, there’s only my master, that’s right!”

Pei Qian slightly bent down, her foot stamping the ground, adopting a stance like a divine drum. 

The landscape shifted.

So much so that several martial temples upstream of the Waving River trembled simultaneously.

Xue Yuansheng was astonished. Was she breaking through? With overwhelming strength, could she seize the martial fortune of the world?!

Pei Qian addressed the old ferryman, “This punch of mine, whether it’s one, ten, or a hundred punches, they’re all the same. If reason lies only in the punch, then take it!”

Li Huai felt that Pei Qian was becoming increasingly out of sorts and wanted to stop her from throwing the punch, but he found it hard to move, unable to take a step forward.

Li Huai shouted desperately, “Pei Qian, if you do this, we might not even be friends anymore! I will definitely tell Chen Ping'an!”

Pei Qian murmured, “My master might never come home again.”

The distraught girl, brimming with martial intent, continued to swell.

The colorful clouds over the River God’s temple began to shift chaotically.

Xue Yuansheng was bitterly smiling at the absurdity of it all. The moment that little girl punched out, it felt like his golden body would shatter! There was no reason for it, unless...

Unless this little girl was breaking through, martial fortune at her side, and then suddenly breaking through once more! Just like that, breaking through two realms in one breath, stepping into the realm of distant travel?!

Xue Yuansheng thought he must have lost his mind.

But the celestial phenomena before him had truly never occurred in the history of the Waving River and Haiguzhuan.

Li Huai lamented, “Whether Chen Ping'an comes home or not, Pei Qian has already reached this point. The one he misjudged in his life was Pei Qian, not Xue Yuansheng!”

Pei Qian suddenly turned and scolded, “Shut your mouth!”

Li Huai, drenched in sweat, reached behind him and nodded, “I’ll hold it in for a while; you smell it, is it fragrant? Chen Ping'an always says it’s fragrant.”

Pei Qian inexplicably recalled something from years ago on the road while traveling.

She lightly clenched her fist, asking Zhu Lian and Shi Rou if they wanted to know what she was hiding in her hand, and Zhu Lian told her to get lost while Shi Rou rolled her eyes. Then, her master had given her a chestnut.

Before that, she had asked questions, and her master had answered.

“Master, does this mean a gentleman doesn’t take away what others enjoy?”

“I’m still far from being a true gentleman.”

“How far? Is it as far as from Lion Garden to here?”

“Probably farther than from Lotus Flower Paradise to Lion Garden.”

“Is it really that far?!”

“Indeed.”

“Master, but as far as it is, it can still be reached, right?”

“Correct, as long as you don’t take the wrong path.”

At this moment, Pei Qian unexpectedly relaxed her stance, reining in her martial intent, quietly picking up her box and walking over to Li Huai to take back the walking stick that her master had personally gifted her.

Xue Yuansheng felt a weight lifted off his shoulders.

In fact, several people atop Pima Sect’s Mu Yi Mountain felt the same relief.

Pei Qian weakly apologized to the River God Xue, then walked toward the ferry.

Li Huai began to understand Pei Qian’s somber mood. It was heavy, and he followed closely beside her. He couldn’t offer her comfort at this moment; he felt just as heavy-hearted.

Pei Qian’s odd behavior today was somewhat related to the impersonation of the old ferryman Xue Yuansheng, but the real source of her distress should be her past and her master’s long absence. There was a possibility, according to Pei Qian’s earlier words, that he might never return home again. Thinking of this made Li Huai feel even more desolate than Pei Qian.

Pei Qian said, “Li Huai, I didn’t mean to.”

Li Huai forced a smile, “Haha, I’m not someone to hold grudges.”

Pei Qian shot him a sideways glance.

The old ferryman caught up to the two, laughing, “I’ll take you across the river, but according to the old rules, I need to charge.”

Pei Qian replied, “I know, eight coins.”

At that moment, Li Huai genuinely began to admire the River God Xue Yuansheng; his heart was as wide as the Waving River, showing no grudges at all.

Xue Yuansheng began to row the boat across the river, with Li Huai sitting in the middle and Pei Qian at the back, turned away from them. Li Huai said to the old ferryman with a smile, “Please tell us about the rules of the water gods. You can say what you can, and what you can’t say, we’ll pretend we didn’t hear.”

Xue Yuansheng nodded and broadly recounted the lives of that clever young man and the group of young men, explaining how they ended up in their current situation and what they might face in the future. He even detailed the wealthy man from whom the silver coins had been stolen and the elderly man and his granddaughter who had nearly been robbed, mixing in some principles of the river gods’ dealings, which weren’t really taboos. Moreover, in this place where the Waving River had no divine oversight, Xue Yuansheng truly didn’t mind such trifles.

Pei Qian didn’t turn around but said, “I misjudged the River God.”

Xue Yuansheng shook his head, “Did you misjudge me? I think not. Many things, like the various hardships in the market, I will only intervene if they’re too excessive; otherwise, I genuinely can’t be bothered. It’s not that I fear the entanglements of karma or that it diminishes my virtue; it’s just that I’ve seen too much and find it tiresome. Moreover, when I act with good intentions, I’ve often ended up with bad outcomes, causing me to be cautious.”

Pei Qian murmured, “My master said one should never blame a good person, so I am in the wrong. What good is practicing martial arts?”

Li Huai scratched his head.

Because of the eight coins, coupled with the girl’s earlier “madness,” Xue Yuansheng suddenly remembered someone, “Little girl, your master wouldn’t be the young man in a bamboo hat carrying a wine gourd who traveled through here years ago, would he?”

Pei Qian turned her head, her eyes glistening with tears, but she smiled at that moment and nodded vigorously, “Yes!”

Xue Yuansheng laughed heartily, “Then your master is much better at reasoning than you. He’s quite congenial, more like a scholar.”

People aren’t truly bad; just a bit off in their minds. The vast wealth of goddesses’ images, offered for free, once angered the Deer Riding Goddess who had been on his boat.

Truly a master and disciple.

Yet, Xue Yuansheng didn’t dare to voice such easily provoked words.

Li Huai was somewhat apprehensive.

Yet Pei Qian’s expression brightened in an instant, her eyes sparkling, “Of course! My master is the most reasonable scholar! He’s also a swordsman!”

See? Master hasn’t misjudged River God Xue Yuansheng.

The one who was wrong was always herself.

As Pei Qian turned back around, Li Huai caught a glimpse of the items Pei Qian had, feeling somewhat helpless. Earlier, he had worried she was getting too fixated, but she had already taken out a set of tools and was now using a scale to measure out silver coins. Using a small pair of scissors, she cut out eight coins from the silver, careful not to cut too much and waste money. The small wooden box on her knee, though small, contained everything from small scissors to green bamboo scales and several weights of varying sizes. One was inscribed with “Never Lose Money,” and another with “Only Make Money”...

Xue Yuansheng found it amusing. The little girl’s demeanor when punching was worlds apart from how she was now, causing him to chuckle, “Alright, since you’re all scholars, I won’t take your money.”

Pei Qian had just cut out eight coins and pointed at Li Huai, saying, “I’m not a scholar; he is. So we’ll give River God four coins.”

Then Pei Qian said to Li Huai, “Helping you pay, make sure to be grateful, alright? About today’s events?”

Li Huai had initially wanted to say he couldn’t afford the coins, but it turned out he could manage the eight coins. Unexpectedly, Pei Qian glared at him, directly splitting the eight coins in half. Li Huai immediately nodded, “Today is a lovely day, the Waving River is calm.”

Then Li Huai suddenly felt something was off. I’m a scholar, I’m the one who shouldn’t need to pay to cross the river!

But he didn’t dare to argue with Pei Qian.

Li Huai feared Pei Qian more than he had ever feared Li Baoping back in the day, as Li Baoping never held a grudge or kept an account. Every time she’d beaten him, it would simply be forgotten.

After paying the fare to cross the river, Li Huai thanked the old ferryman.

Pei Qian didn’t say a word, merely bowing in farewell.

Xue Yuansheng waved, rowing back to the opposite shore, feeling a mix of emotions. He didn’t know whether to say that today’s outing was a waste or not.

Li Huai felt lighter after leaving.

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “What did you say before about smelling good?”

Li Huai’s knees buckled, and he felt that no one could save him now.

Pei Qian abruptly turned her head.

Li Huai followed Pei Qian’s gaze and blinked in disbelief, “Sister?!”

Li Liu smiled with narrowed eyes, gently nodding.

Li Huai dashed over, pinching both sides of Li Liu’s cheeks and pulling gently, “Sister, you’re not a fake, are you? Where did you spring from?”

Li Liu’s smile was radiant.

Beside them, a fox beauty named Wei Taizhen felt like she had been struck by lightning, as if she had suffered a calamity. 

This is the younger brother that the master occasionally mentions? Good-looking, good-tempered, good at studying, talented, good-hearted... Everything is good about Li Huai?!

Pei Qian approached Li Huai’s side, smiling brightly, “Sister Li Liu.”

Li Huai quickly withdrew his hands.

Li Liu nodded at Pei Qian and smiled, “With you around him, I feel more at ease.”

Li Huai quickly pulled his sister aside, lowering his voice, “Sister, why did you come? Two young girls traveling so far from Lion Peak to Haiguzhuan? I’m not saying it’s not okay, but you’re not good-looking, yet your friend is stunning! I’ll tell you, there are plenty of ruffians here at Haiguzhuan. It’s fine; I just made an acquaintance with the River God of the Waving River. If anything happens, just mention my name... Forget it, the River God doesn’t even know my name. It would be more effective to mention Pei Qian’s name. Earlier, Pei Qian almost threw a punch. Good heavens, as expected of the famous River God of the Waving River, calm and collected, smiling without fear. If I were facing Pei Qian, I’d have collapsed to the ground already!”

Li Liu softly said, “I won’t accompany you on your travels. I have some matters to attend to.”

Li Huai exclaimed in frustration, “I don’t want you to travel with me either! What’s it like to have an older sister following me around? Are you trying to find a brother-in-law along the way?”

Li Liu suddenly asked, “Do you have a red thread in your bamboo box?”

Li Huai paused, “Why? Sister, do you have a crush? Is that why you need a wedding gift? Is the future brother-in-law’s mind in the wrong place, thinking he can gain wealth without courting you? Wouldn’t that anger our mother enough to pull your arm off?”

Li Liu sighed.

Li Huai laughed, “Sister, what are you thinking? I’m just teasing you.”

In the end, Li Liu walked a few miles with her brother before turning back, but she didn’t take the porcelain brush-washing basin. She only took the red string and gave her brother a small item, which he casually tossed into his bamboo box.

Li Liu asked, “Why aren’t you wearing the clothes and shoes Yang Laotou gave you?”

Li Huai rolled his eyes, “Those items were hard-earned by the old man. If I wear them now while wandering off, they’ll be a mess in no time. I wouldn’t want to embarrass the old man. If he has to pull out money to buy something, he might tremble with sorrow while handing it over. Haha, just picturing that scene makes me laugh. So I’ll save it for when I’m closer to home and wear them then.”

Li Liu said, “You should wear them now.”

Li Huai impatiently replied, “We’ll talk about it later.”

Li Liu didn’t press her brother any further.

In the end, Li Liu left behind the Golden Core fox beauty Wei Taizhen, whose hometown was not far away, just within Ghostly Maw Valley’s Baojing Mountain.

Thus, poor Li Huai almost broke down. The so-called Li girl, a direct disciple of the Lion Peak’s ancestral hall, blinked her eyes, staring intently at him. What are you looking at? Can’t you see I’m not handsome enough?

Pei Qian was unbothered. Regardless of the other’s background, since she was a genuine mountain deity, they could look out for each other. If there was any unexpected trouble, Wei Taizhen could take Li Huai and flee.

Afterward, the three of them traveled in silence.

Li Huai was unwilling to speak.

Wei Taizhen dared not speak.

Pei Qian was too lazy to talk, merely holding her walking stick when she suddenly asked, “Li Huai, my master will definitely return, right?”

Li Huai replied, “Of course! Chen Ping'an treats you so well; we all see it.”

Pei Qian’s spirits lifted as she said, “Your sister treats you well too.”

Li Huai nodded.

Pei Qian lightly waved her walking stick and hummed a little folk song, “Stinky tofu smells good, but I can’t afford it! There are spirits and monsters in the mountains, and water ghosts in the rivers and lakes. Turning around in fright, it turns out I’ve been away from home for so many years. Eating stinky tofu! Whose little girl carries the fragrance of orchids, why are her tears staining her face? Isn’t that a pity? It’s truly unfortunate not to be able to eat stinky tofu...”

Suddenly, Pei Qian jolted awake, growing furious. To her surprise, Li Huai had already stealthily distanced himself from Pei Qian. By the time Pei Qian regained her composure, he was already sprinting away.

Pei Qian looked around and quickly caught up to Li Huai, kicking him down. Li Huai sprang up without looking back, continuing to flee.

Wei Taizhen wiped the sweat from her forehead.

The people from her hometown were all quite terrifying. 

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 811: Before the Water Falls and Stones Emerge

Before Pei Qian left the Mural City and inquired about the God of Boxing, Xue He, the scene unfolded at the Immortal Mansion ruins depicted in the scroll within the city. The venerable Ancestor Yan Su had instructed his only direct disciple, Pang Lanxi, to continue practicing swordplay, allowing her to take a moment's rest if needed. Yan Su had unlocked the mountain's restrictions, returned to the Ancestor Hall of Mu Yi Mountain, and then rode the wind to the Sword Hanging Pavilion halfway up the mountain. There he paid his respects to the esteemed Nalan Ancestor, who hailed from the Pima Sect's upper lineage in the Central Plains. Despite Nalan Ancestor's approachable demeanor, as a ruling ancestor of the upper lineage, he was known for his extreme severity, having personally dealt with the lives of two upper fifth realm cultivators.

As an esteemed elder from the upper lineage, Nalan Ancestor was of advanced age and held a high status, being a junior of the sect master. He neither sent a message via flying sword nor went directly to the mountain's peak Ancestor Hall, which left Yan Su feeling quite anxious. 

The verdant Mu Yi Mountain was perpetually surrounded by white clouds at its midsection, resembling a blue-robed immortal adorned with a white jade belt. 

Upon arriving outside the Sword Hanging Pavilion, Yan Su found Nalan Ancestor in jovial spirits, drinking with Wei Yusong. The elder was tipsy and laughing heartily, whimsically reaching out to scatter the white clouds outside the pavilion. 

Yan Su breathed a sigh of relief; when Nalan Ancestor was drunk, he was generally more agreeable, and Wei Yusong had certainly made a contribution to that. 

The pair of young men and women with swords on their backs greeted Yan Su proactively. His eyelids twitched, and his heart tightened. 

He had long admired their reputation; the man was named Sui Yuan, and the woman was called Cheng Xin. This couple, both in the Nascent Soul realm, had not yet reached the upper fifth realm but were destined to be the future masters of the Impermanence Division of the Ancestor Hall. 

The world of Impermanence was a realm governed by Pima Sect's upper lineage, barring a few stray paths. 

Nalan Ancestor's decision to bring along these two formidable figures from the upper lineage to the lower sect was a clear warning.

After Yan Su took a seat, Wei Yusong spoke candidly, "Nalan Ancestor has come to hold us accountable, feeling that we are too entangled with the Song clan of the Great Li." 

The young woman named Cheng Xin retrieved a book from her sleeve and handed it to Yan Su with a smile, saying, "Please take a look at this first, Yan Overseer." 

Yan Su was puzzled but noticed the quality of the book upon handling it; it clearly was not a celestial manuscript. Wei Yusong wore a worried expression, and Yan Su began to flip through its pages. 

Meanwhile, Nalan Ancestor continued to drink with the younger Wei Yusong, reminiscing about a near purchase of a celestial-grade ink wash pot in the Mural City, which had a bottom inscription that did not conform to proper etiquette—a solitary line from an obscure poem: "Riding the raft to welcome the immortal guest, I once visited the stars by the three constellations."

The old cultivator was delighted by this discovery, understanding its worth, though such an ink wash pot was not considered an extraordinary treasure, merely valued at a few minor coins. However, he was willing to spend a significant amount to acquire it, for that line of poetry was not well-known in the Central Plains, yet he recognized it, having seen the poet and heard the poem recited himself.

The mountain immortals knew of Nalan Ancestor's fondness for poetry. Aside from elegant verses, he also appreciated a kind of divination poetry, akin to the refined expressions of the literary elite, often involving ancient figures and the poetic masters of various dynasties. Whenever the elder encountered something noteworthy, he recorded it meticulously.

However, what intrigued Nalan Ancestor most about this poem was not the content but its exceedingly long title, which even surpassed the poem itself: "In the final years of the Yuanbao era, drunk by the Spring Ming Gate, I dreamt of playing in the celestial river with the immortal youth, awakening from my intoxicated dreams, inspired to compose this poem."

Back then, the elder was just a youth himself, who once accompanied his master on a journey down the mountain. In a rain-drenched worldly dynasty, he encountered a down-and-out scholar named Bai Ye. His master invited the scholar to drink, and the scholar offered this poem as payment for the drinks. The young man, after hearing such a lengthy title, had expected it to be an elaborate poem of several hundred characters, only to find that the entire poem, including the line, amounted to a mere twenty-eight characters. Unable to contain himself, he asked, "Is that all?" The scholar merely laughed and departed.

Nalan Ancestor set down the wine jug and asked, "Have you finished reading?"

Yan Su's expression turned ashen as he replied solemnly, "Nalan Ancestor, could it be that you also believe the contents of this book?"

Nalan Ancestor laughed dismissively.

Wei Yusong interjected, "Nalan Ancestor wants to ascertain one thing: how has such a book gradually circulated in the Central Plains to the extent that it can be casually found on cross-ocean ferry boats? What is written in this book may be important or unimportant, but the key question is, who wrote it, and why are we from the Pima Sect entangled with someone named Chen Ping'an?"

Nalan Ancestor continued to play with the clouds, while Yan Su crushed the book in his hands, tossing it outside the Sword Hanging Pavilion. Yan Su was capable of debating rationally but lacked the skill for confrontation, leaving him feeling utterly stifled. He had no choice but to ask Wei Yusong for a jug of wine.

Nalan Ancestor spoke slowly, "Zhu Quan is too simple-minded; when he thinks, he prefers to complicate things rather than simplify them. Wei Yusong is overly focused on earning money, intent on changing the Pima Sect's precarious situation, fixated on financial gains that he cannot escape from. Both of you, old ancestors of the Pima Sect, are merely here to scold without taking action. If I do not come personally to investigate, I will be uneasy."

Yan Su took a deep gulp of wine, muttering, "Nalan Ancestor won't just come to take a look at the Bone Beach. If the upper lineage gets angry about this, they will definitely seek a scapegoat. It's quite simple. I, Yan Su, can take full responsibility for this matter, and it has nothing to do with Zhu Quan or Wei Yusong."

Nalan Ancestor replied, "Before I came, the upper lineage had already reached a conclusion. Regardless of the circumstances, we must sever ties with the Piyun Mountain and the Great Li’s Song clan. As for why it has to be me, you should know very well that both the Pima Sect and the upper sect of the Central Plains, regardless of the truth, are unwilling to risk the entire Pima Sect over some celestial money. They would rather believe in the existence of such people than dismiss them outright. Moreover, this book has spread rapidly, and the upper sect is unwilling to see the entire Pima Sect fall into a pit for the sake of some celestial coins."

Nalan Ancestor continued, "Zhu Quan may not be responsible, but he is still the sect leader. Let's put it bluntly: why should you, Yan Su, take the blame? Furthermore, with Zhu Quan's temperament, it is not your place to play the good guy."

Yan Su muttered, "Nalan Ancestor and the elders of the upper sect are not blind. We have our own cross-ocean ferry, and a few more steps..."

At this point, Yan Su fell silent. Would he be able to find that Chen kid in the Fallen Mountain? Nalan Ancestor would not be able to see him at all.

Wei Yusong declared, "To protect our reputation and avoid blame is not something Pima Sect cultivators would do. Nalan Ancestor, I still hold my original stance: since the upper sect has given orders, the lower sect must obey. We can sever all business ties with the Fallen Mountain. However, starting today, I, Wei Yusong, will move the chairs of the Pima Sect Ancestor Hall outside and no longer concern myself with financial matters. I will head to Qinglu Town to follow Zhu Quan and deal with the bone framework instead; it will be easier that way."

Yan Su retorted angrily, "I have received my master's grace for a long time. The upper sect will do as it pleases, but I cannot harm my own disciples and lose our moral standing! What is the Pima Sect cultivator worth? If I go to the Fallen Mountain, I might as well burn incense and pay respects at the Fallen Mountain Ancestor Hall!"

Nalan Ancestor smiled, "Oh? Are you all trying to scare me? It seems the earlier invitation to drink was not a toast but a punishment drink?"

Wei Yusong shook his head, "We wouldn’t dare."

Yan Su threw down the wine jug, saying, "What can scaring an old man do?!"

Nalan Ancestor did not bother to argue with Yan Su, standing up with a smile, "Let’s head to the Pima Sect Ancestor Hall. Remember to call Zhu Quan back."

Wei Yusong shot Yan Su a fierce glare, warning him against acting impulsively.

On the way to the top of Mu Yi Mountain's Ancestor Hall, Wei Yusong was evidently unwilling to give up, saying to Nalan Ancestor, "The current state of the Pima Sect’s array is thanks in no small part to the Fallen Mountain; Ghost Valley has been stable for ten years now."

Nalan Ancestor laughed, "This has been mentioned early on by the upper sect's Ancestor Hall. Do you think I am old and forgetful?"

Wei Yusong finally despaired and ceased his persuasion.

When Zhu Quan was called back to the Ancestor Hall, she simply stated, "No one should be bullied like this. I don’t want to be this broken sect leader anymore."

Nalan Ancestor neither nodded nor refuted, only asking, "Do you still know that you are the sect leader?"

Zhu Quan fell silent, feeling dejected.

Yan Su grew anxious, thinking to himself that he had already acted impulsively, but Zhu Quan should not act recklessly.

Nalan Ancestor was indeed a tough nut to crack; if she did not wish to be sect leader, it was fine, but she should consider carefully, reflect quietly for a few days in the Ancestor Hall, and when the time came, if she still decided to resign as sect leader, she would only need to bid farewell to each portrait in the Ancestor Hall. Afterward, Zhu Quan could leave the Ancestor Hall and head to Ghost Valley's Qinglu Town. The Pima Sect would be fine without a leader; it would not make much of a difference. She did not need to inform anyone. Once the flying sword message reached the upper sect, they could quickly find someone capable of taking the position. Although the Pima Sect was a lower sect, it was still a leader among the righteous world. There were plenty of candidates from the upper sect willing to come to the Northern Julu Continent.

Afterward, Zhu Quan remained in the Ancestor Hall, and Yan Su often brought wine, but since they could not drink in the Ancestor Hall, they simply sat outside the main door to drink together. Zhu Quan occasionally turned to raise her wine jug toward the portraits of the ancestors, offering them a taste of the wine they could no longer savor.

In the Mural City shop, the young shopkeeper smiled brightly upon seeing Pang Lanxi.

With no customers in the store, Pang Lanxi leaned over the counter, lamenting her master’s swordsmanship as being too difficult and hard to learn.

She mentioned that Pei Qian and a friend named Li Huai had come by the shop earlier and, seeing she wasn’t there, said they'd return when they were headed home.

Pang Lanxi held back a laugh, saying, "That Pei Qian—was she very peculiar?"

The young shopkeeper shook her head, "Not at all; she is very polite."

However, she suddenly sighed, recalling the way that girl’s eyes seemed to speak. It was as if she understood the unspoken words in Pei Qian’s gaze.

Seizing the opportunity while Pang Lanxi was nearby, she bit her lip, deciding it was time to confide her worries. Gathering her courage, she said, "Lanxi, I’ve been thinking that after these years in the shop, I’ve saved up some celestial coins. I can afford a box of the divine pills from Chunlu Garden that help women maintain their beauty. I just want to grow old more slowly, to have my gray hair grow more slowly..."

Pang Lanxi was about to speak when she shook her head, saying, "Let me finish. I used to think that if I could just live to a ripe old age, it would be fine. If I became an ugly, old woman, and you changed your mind, I wouldn’t blame you. But now, I don’t want that. The Earth Goddess here in Mural City has said she wants to get rid of her burdens and go see the world, and I have a slim chance to inherit her identity. However, the Earth Goddess directly told me that to become a local deity, though the rank is low—just a land mistress—I don’t have any celestial roots or destiny. This so-called chance depends on the blessing of the old immortals of Mu Yi Mountain. So I want to ask you, would this be difficult for you?"

Pang Lanxi nodded, her gaze gentle and her tone firm, simply saying, "Good!"

The young shopkeeper sighed in relief, though she couldn’t shake off some lingering anxiety, as the Earth Mistress had mentioned that becoming a deity came with dangers, speaking of the soul's exhaustion and such, which was truly frightening.

A graceful girl emerged from the ground outside the shop, and she was the Earth Mistress of Mu Yi Mountain. 

With a serious expression, she said, "You both dare to agree—one truly dares to agree, and one genuinely dares to agree. This carries great risks, mind you. I’ll say it again, although you Pima Sect are skilled in the ways of the soul, accidents are inevitable. If I were to say, it would be better for her to become a nominal goddess at the Shaking River, even if in truth she remains a ghost bound by her soul. That’s not a divine being, but it’s much safer. That old boatman Xue, being under your Pima Sect's roof, wouldn’t dare mistreat someone like you, Pang Lanxi."

Pang Lanxi thought for a moment, "Well, there's no rush. I'll ask Chen Ping'an later; he’s the most thoughtful when it comes to these matters."

At this moment, she tugged at her collar, saying, "I’m a nominal offering to the Fallen Mountain; can’t he help with such a small favor?"

The young shopkeeper nodded with a smile, gently hooking her finger around Pang Lanxi’s hand. Pang Lanxi reciprocated, holding her delicate hand.

The girl, now the Earth Mistress, said, "Boring, this is really boring. Why not just close the shop and cause some chaos? I wouldn’t eavesdrop or anything."

---

The aloof upper lineage ancestor, who had stirred anger among the Pima Sect, did not leave Mu Yi Mountain as expected. Instead, he stayed with the young couple from the Impermanence Division, taking the opportunity to explore more. It was rare for him to venture out, and he felt the need to gather more information; if there was anything to discuss, he could send word via flying sword later. In reality, Nalan Ancestor was quite interested in visiting the Spirit-Calling Sect on Tongye Continent, where the spirit-calling arts were truly remarkable.

However, the elder did not remain idle; he spent his days gazing at the mirror of illusions, primarily to understand the current situations atop Nan Posuo and Fuyiao Continent, or to use his divine powers to observe the Shaking River. Otherwise, he would retrieve his compiled poetry from the Sword Hanging Pavilion and take some white clouds from halfway up the mountain, condensing them into a desk to hold a large stack of poetry. He would also draw a round moon from the Shaking River to hang beside the desk as illumination.

On the mountain, there were all sorts of immortals, some playful like the old village chief, but most were like Nalan Ancestor—untainted by worldly matters, with an ethereal demeanor.

In reality, the old cultivator hailed from humble beginnings, not a child of a wealthy family or born in the mountains, but he had begun his cultivation in the mountains from a young age.

One night, the old cultivator closed a book of poetry.

He remembered the first time he ventured out; his master had sent him to the mountain gate, saying, "Go into the mountains."

The youth was puzzled, asking why he wasn’t going down the mountain.

His master didn’t explain.

It was much later, in his more mature years, that he understood his master’s deeper meaning—the path of cultivation and climbing mountains was not an easy one. The hearts of people in the world were full of treachery, making it even more challenging to journey through the mountains.

The elder sighed and opened a travelogue, continuing to read the first few thousand characters of the introduction. As for the stories that followed—about fortunate encounters, young men studying martial arts and reading, singing poetry with goddesses and enchanting ghosts, sweet nothings, vows of devotion, and tales of roguish heroism that left behind a mess for others to clear—he found them utterly unappealing.

The elder continued reading and asked the young couple nearby, "Sui Yuan, Cheng Xin, what do you think about the truth of what’s written in this book?"

The young woman shook her head, "If I were to judge this book solely by its contents, even if it contained one or two truths, I would certainly avoid that person if I encountered them in the future, keeping my distance instead. On the other hand, Gu Chan requires no such caution."

The young man said, "After venturing far and wide, speaking as a lecturer while criticizing others without reflecting on oneself is a waste of the travelogue's innocent opening words."

At this point, the young man glanced at his companion, cautiously adding, "If we were to only consider the opening lines, the young man's situation was quite dire. I sincerely hope he can rise to greatness and turn his suffering into joy."

The young woman smiled, "In the study, the red sleeves add fragrance; in the world, leaning against the red and green, which true-hearted man wouldn’t envy?"

The young man smiled bitterly, knowing some things were better left unsaid.

That day, the old cultivator gazed at the mountain and river scroll on the cloud desk, seemingly surprised. He reached out to wipe it clean, pushing the scroll aside to allow the celestial couple to observe the mundane world. The two young Nascent Soul cultivators from the Impermanence Division were the pride of the Pima Sect, born as mountain-born celestial beings, with parents who were cultivators. The union of Sui Yuan and Cheng Xin was no small celebration. The only drawback was that both Sui Yuan and Cheng Xin were somewhat lacking in their understanding of the underbelly of society, having superficial thoughts.

The scroll depicted the young girl and the scholar as they arrived at the river god's temple to burn incense.

The old cultivator stroked his beard and laughed, "This girl is so frugal that she can’t even bear to buy fragrant water for the temple. It doesn’t quite match her master’s style as mentioned in the book. But then again, she is quite savvy, having considerable experience in the world. Sui Yuan, Cheng Xin, if you were on the same level as this girl, you’d probably end up helping her count coins after she sold you out. Quite a humorous scenario!"

After Pei Qian finished burning incense at the river god's temple, the astonishing event of the boxing match with Xue Yuansheng unfolded, ultimately leading to no significant disturbances.

Old boatman Xue Yuansheng personally ferried the two across the river, which could be considered a case of fate taking a hand in their acquaintance.

Meanwhile, the boy who had attempted to steal from the river god’s temple was beaten black and blue by a robust young man. The youth rolled on the ground, clutching his head, crying and begging for mercy, covered in blood and dirt. After the group of men left, the youth was warned to be more diligent, needing to steal fifty taels of silver within a month to cover his medical expenses, or else they would settle old and new debts together.

The boy stumbled through a thicket of reeds, making his way to the Shaking River's edge. He removed his outer garment to wash, grimacing from the pain of his injuries. After rolling on the ground, his face was well-protected, with little visible damage. Only his hands escaped unscathed, as the men had warned him not to get hurt while they were beating him. After all, the gifted boy was a cash cow for his gang, relying on his hands to steal without anyone noticing. 

The boy returned to a small alley outside Mural City, where an old courtyard gate still bore the familiar door god and couplets, along with a spring character at the top. 

Since the posting had not been up for long, it was still fresh and unwrinkled.

The boy scanned his surroundings, noticing no one was around, and then looked toward the gap in the yellow mud courtyard wall beside the door god, seeing two copper coins still there. He let out a sigh of relief and smiled.

The copper coins were certainly not valuable, but they held great significance for this family.

They had jokingly referred to this hidden spot as "the innermost part of the door god."

During a time when their family was struggling to make ends meet, he had once found those two coins while playing with his sister.

Celestial coins—two snowflake coins.

Over the years, they had never been spent; the boy was afraid of attracting trouble, and their mother was adamant about keeping them, saying one snowflake coin was to be reserved for him as a bride price, while the other was for his sister's dowry—how wonderful.

He later learned that their mother, had it not been for suddenly acquiring those two celestial coins, would have been pushed to the brink and would have chosen to suffer more, struggling day by day with her two children. She would have almost agreed to those ruthless creditors, becoming a boat woman, allowing patrons to pay a few copper coins for the chance to touch her while ferrying them across the river, stopping at the Shaking River at night. She would light a lantern; men seeing the light could seek her out for the night, and when she got older, she might end up becoming a brothel worker. No matter what, if their mother had truly gone through with this, their family would have more money, and the lives of him and his sister would have been much better. Their mother often spoke of these things without reservation, but the boy was certainly unwilling, and his sister would turn pale every time she heard it, secretly whispering her gratitude to the door gods. 

Thus, in their family tradition, when new door gods were replaced, the old ones were never discarded. Their mother would have him and his sister carefully invite down a door god and neatly store it away for safekeeping. And the mysterious appearance of those two snowflake coins coincided with their mother replacing the two copper coins.

The only thing the boy regretted was not being able to be a scholar; he truly had no such aspirations. Yet, the disappointment on their mother’s face when she didn’t say anything left him feeling uneasy.

In his early years, he once took a snowflake coin with the intention of exchanging it for silver to buy some pastries for his sister, allowing their mother and sister to live a more comfortable life. However, he was dragged back home by his seemingly mad mother, who had never been able to bear hitting him before, but she beat him mercilessly that time. His younger sister, even smaller than him, cried out in despair, as if she felt the pain more than he did.

From that day on, as the only male in the family, he vowed to make money! It was only after becoming a youth that he understood that had his mother not stopped him that day, the three of them would not have lived a good life, and they would only have encountered further calamities. Let alone having two snowflake coins, even two minor summer coins could have been extorted by those ruthless rogues who had killed before, and he, along with his mother, would not have been able to protect those celestial coins that fell from the sky.

By the time the boy was capable of quietly exchanging the snowflake coins for silver using his own abilities and connections, he had already changed his mind. He would leave those two snowflake coins for his sister; she absolutely must not let those brutes lay a finger on her. She would have to marry a good man in the future, and she and their mother must leave Bone Beach; he would be enough for this place. With his own abilities, he was sure he could survive.

Today, the boy pushed open the door, finding his sister, who lived in the same room with their mother, cutting paper-cuts. She was quite skilled at making beautiful paper-cuts, learning quickly with just a glance. Although this didn’t earn a lot of money or fill their stomachs, it was still a means to earn.

The girl looked up in surprise, "Brother, you’re back! I’ll go call Mother home to make you a good meal!"

The boy picked a small stool and sat beside her, smiling and shaking his head gently, "No need. I’m doing quite well; don’t you know? Our mother’s cooking is good, but when the household has no money or oil, it’s hard to eat. If we have money, it’s all oil; it’s really unpalatable. I came in a hurry this time, so I didn’t bring any gifts."

The girl smiled, her eyes sparkling and clean, squinting into crescent shapes, "No need, no need."

The boy grinned, raising his hand to ruffle his hair, then slowly opened his palm, revealing a piece of silver, "Here you go."

The girl hesitated but accepted the piece of silver, which was heavy—seven or eight coins.

The boy settled on the stool, leaning forward, resting his hands on his cheeks, gazing toward the door gods that faced the room beyond the opened door.

In truth, this precocious boy no longer believed in door gods or spirits, suspecting they might be that young wanderer he had once encountered wearing a bamboo hat.

However, their mother and sister firmly believed that those two snowflake coins were indeed the door gods’ divine manifestations.

But does it matter whether they were or weren’t?

Meanwhile, the pair of elderly folks who had nearly been robbed by the boy left the temple and climbed onto a rickety horse carriage hired from their hometown, making their way back along the Shaking River.

The child expressed a desire to read, and the old man chuckled, advising against reading while bouncing around on the rough road, saying they could read when they got home.

The child laughed and remarked that once they got home, he wouldn’t say that anymore. The old man affectionately ruffled the child’s hair, and the child suddenly said, "Earlier, in the grand house of the river god, there was a sister walking next to us, and her smile was so beautiful."

The old man pondered for a moment, recalling, "You mean the pair carrying that bamboo box?"

The child vigorously nodded, "Later, as we walked faster, that sister walked more slowly. Whenever I turned to look at her, she would smile."

The old man smiled, "That would be the scholar traveling to study."

The child asked, "Grandpa, was that bamboo stick a walking stick? I saw that sister and brother walking just fine."

The old man couldn't help but chuckle, patiently explaining, "That’s not just any walking stick; it has a name—called a traveler's staff. Scholars often need to cross mountains and rivers on their journeys. Some people, not particularly wealthy, still want to expand their knowledge, and with no servants to follow them, must carry their own burdens through mountains and waters, hence the need for a walking stick."

The child laughed, "Ha, we also don’t have much money, so I guess I’ll need a traveling staff in the future."

The old man ruffled the child’s hair, saying, "Reading thousands of books costs a lot of money, but traveling thousands of miles only requires endurance. When I was young, I traveled with good friends to various prestigious families and literary houses, spending my days borrowing and copying books, returning them to borrow more. Some scholarly families were very generous, welcoming us poor scholars to copy books, merely advising us not to damage them. They would even treat us to good dishes occasionally, but sometimes the servants would complain a little, joking that the oil prices had risen again since we stayed up late reading. These things didn’t matter."

The child yawned repeatedly.

The old man cradled the child in his arms, who was beginning to feel sleepy. After all the walking, the child started to drift off.

The old man softly murmured, "In my twenties, I dashed through life with my writings, unstoppable. By thirty, my talents began to wane, and I could only stew in my thoughts. As I aged, I didn’t expect to write things that were out of my usual style, merely inviting friends to the paper and sharing stories."

The carriage driver suddenly interjected, "Again carrying books and swords in a vast expanse."

The old man in the carriage was taken aback, thinking the driver shouldn’t have such eloquence. He gently set the child down, lifting the curtain.

The young driver turned around, asking, "What does the old man mean?"

The old man smiled, asking, "What do you mean by 'again carrying books and swords in a vast expanse'?"

The driver was baffled, "What does the old man mean?"

The old man was speechless, chuckling at his own misunderstanding.

Meanwhile, that illiterate driver inexplicably thought of seeking out Chen Lingjun.

In the next moment, he completely forgot about this notion.

On Mu Yi Mountain, as Pei Qian and Li Huai boarded the boat, Nalan Ancestor put away the mountain and river scroll, falling into deep contemplation.

Sui Yuan remarked, "It’s a lineage passed down. Where there is a master, there will be a disciple; where there is a disciple, there will be a master."

Cheng Xin nodded in agreement.

After a moment, the old cultivator planned to take another look, so he activated his divine powers, exclaiming in surprise that a small fox spirit at the Golden Core stage had suddenly appeared beside the two children.

Then, inexplicably, the scroll began to blur.

The celestial couple exchanged glances in confusion.

Nalan Ancestor smiled, retracting his divine powers.

At the tea stand by the Shaking River, customers were sparse, preparing to close for the day.

The shopkeeper retrieved two feathers, one from a literary sparrow and the other from a martial sparrow.

He said to the young clerk who was dozing at the table, "It’s time to get to work."

Suddenly, a young woman appeared, taking a seat, "I advise you not to do it."

---

As night fell, Li Huai walked beside Pei Qian, quietly saying, "Pei Qian, teach me boxing, will you?"

Pei Qian hesitated, her expression unusual. This trip involved her taking punches, after all.

Pei Qian thought for a long while and finally shook her head, "Learning boxing is too hard."

After a pause, she added, "Moreover, I don’t know how to teach boxing."

Li Huai actually seemed a bit pleased, smiling, "I learn things so slowly, that it’s even better if you don’t teach me boxing. If I fail to learn, I won’t be heartbroken, and you won’t have to worry about misleading a disciple. If it were Chen Ping'an, I wouldn’t dare to learn from him; his nature would not allow me to slack off... Pei Qian, I’m just being honest; don’t be upset."

Pei Qian pondered for a moment and said, "You’ve seen my master’s two boxing stances; didn’t you see them earlier? They aren’t hard to learn; you should be able to grasp them."

Li Huai grumbled, "I just randomly learned a 'Thousand Autumns' sleep stance; in truth, I remember nothing of what Chen Ping'an said. I just pretended to learn. I wouldn’t dare to learn the six-step stances or the sword furnace stances; I’m afraid I’d be laughed at by Li Baoping and the others."

Pei Qian shook her head, "I don’t teach boxing. I don’t know much about boxing myself."

Li Huai insisted, "You do know! Didn’t you just spar with Xue He?"

Pei Qian merely remained silent.

Where my boxing lands, she thought while glancing up at the night sky.

On the earth below, the sounds of night insects chirping surrounded them. 

---

Not far from the White Cloud Temple in the Qingluan Kingdom, an old monk who had traveled there rented a courtyard. Every day he would boil soup; although it was a vegetarian pot, it somehow tasted like chicken soup.

Thus, he earned the nickname "Chicken Soup Monk."

He was not adept at divination but could read palms. Occasionally he would tell fortunes, but more often than not, he would clarify doubts for others. Each session would cost one to two silver coins; once you entered, you had to pay, and if you were dissatisfied with the clarification, there would be no refunds.

One day, a scholar came to inquire whether he could achieve success in the imperial examinations.

After examining the scholar's palm, the old monk shook his head.

The scholar was first disappointed, then grew furious, seemingly harboring grievances for a long time. He began to rant about how the imperial examinations were misleading, listing a pile of reasons, arguing that only a few top scholars could pen timeless poetry.

The old monk extended his hand, and the scholar angrily tossed a silver coin at him.

Once the old monk secured the coin, he smiled and said, "Whether the imperial examinations mislead or not, I won’t comment. But it’s true that your chances of becoming an official are slim."

The scholar’s face turned red and ears hot, "You don’t read palms correctly!"

The old monk chuckled to himself, "Moreover, when you say top scholars can’t write timeless poems, it sounds as if you can write them yourself. Historically, how many top scholars are there? It’s still a rough estimate. You, a failed scholar with poor skills, can’t be counted among them. Some fallen scholars indeed have talent and skill but can’t make a name for themselves in the examinations; it’s simply due to their character and fate. For someone like you, not only will you fail the examinations, but you’ll also fail at everything else. If you rely on family wealth to get by, that’s fine."

The scholar huffed and left. 

"You fool," the old monk shook his head. "Those who blame the heavens must endure great suffering to do so. If virtue does not match position, there’s no reason for resentment; even a self-sufficient person cannot entertain such thoughts." 

Just then, the scholar, still at the door putting on his shoes, heard these words and became infuriated, turning around to shout, "Bald donkey, are you looking for a beating?"

"You can beat me," the old monk replied, "but you’ll have to pay for the medicine!"

The scholar hesitated but ultimately left, telling people not to waste their silver coins on this old monk, who now had a decent reputation in the capital of the Qingluan Kingdom, with a steady stream of people waiting to have their palms read.

A despondent young man entered the room, asking if he could rekindle a romantic relationship.

The old monk examined his palm and shook his head, indicating it was unlikely.

The young man lamented his heartbreak, muttering about how unfeeling she was, but he bore no resentment towards her, only anger at his own poverty and powerlessness. When he reached the peak of his sorrow, a grown man suddenly found himself trembling with clenched fists, crying inconsolably.

The old monk nodded, "Good, good, harboring no resentment towards others is a good habit."

The young man choked out, "Master, I just want to know how to resolve this heartache; otherwise, I can’t go on living, I truly can’t."

It was likely that he had seen the suffering of fellow practitioners before, as the young man raised his head, stating, "Don’t give me that nonsense about letting go! Don’t give me that glib advice about finding the one who tied the knot! I can’t let go, I refuse to let go! I just want her to change her mind, I’m willing to do anything..." He whispered the name of the girl, displaying his infatuation.

The old monk replied, "There are two methods. One is simple: fasting cures all ailments. The other is more complicated, but it allows you to understand that you can endure your current days and still live on. There’s another method, but you’ll need to seek out the matchmaker."

After speaking, the old monk rubbed his fingers together.

The young man shook his head, "I have no silver left."

The old monk looked at him with disdain, "Then starve."

The young man fell to the ground, crying.

The old monk sighed, "Alright, alright. Extend your hand."

The young man extended his hand, and the old monk gently tapped his palm. The young man immediately went blank, and moments later, he woke up as if from a dream, drenched in sweat.

The old monk said, "I will take one silver coin from you; you merely had a nightmare, but I bore the real pain of your heart and soul. Now go."

The young man stumbled away.

The old monk softly sighed, bringing his fingers together and lightly draping his robes over himself.

Afterward, a man who felt deceived by the monk tossed a silver coin on the ground and seated himself, bracing his hands on his knees, gritting his teeth, "If I have to pay to hit someone, then I won't hit anyone; I’ll just curse them, how about that?!"

The old monk shook his head, "That's not permissible."

The man scoffed, "Why not?!"

"Of course, you can curse me. I don’t mind; it’s just that I can’t bear to see you add more karma to your mouth. Since I’ve taken your silver, I wouldn’t want to harm you; that wouldn’t sit well with my conscience. Those who are trapped by their own words and karma often don’t realize how they’ve harmed themselves. Blessings and calamities come without doors; it’s all summoned by oneself. The mouth and the heart are two gates, and blessings and calamities come without doors, all summoned by oneself. When I speak of closing the gate, I refer to keeping one’s speech pure and one’s heart untainted; Confucians speak of caution in solitude, which also involves closing the gate. Taoists value purity, still they close the gate. It’s hard to guard the heart gate; even those who refine themselves on the mountain fear it greatly. For us common folk, if we can’t even manage to say a few less words, that’s not good. Do you still want to curse?"

The man didn’t hesitate, unleashing a flurry of curses, spitting everywhere.

The old monk cast a glance at the silver coin on the ground, enduring it. He did not chase the man away, simply waiting until the man had exhausted his strength in cursing, allowing him to leave before extending his fingers, lightly pulling back, then giving his robe a gentle wipe.

What was done inside stayed inside; as for everything else, it was a matter of fate.

Next, a middle-aged scholar came, bowing at the door before stepping inside, sitting on the mat, gently placing silver on the ground, and then asking, "May I ask the master, if Buddhism speaks of cause and effect, of reincarnation; if there truly is an afterlife, paying debts in one life for another, then in the next life, I wouldn’t know about my former life—would I still be me? If I don’t know I’m me, with all these karmic retributions, whether good or bad, I’ll be left to unknowingly suffer. When will it end?"

"Good question."

The old monk smiled, "It can be resolved. Allow me to explain slowly."

The man couldn’t help but ask, "Why can’t all karmic retributions manifest in this life?"

The old monk’s eyes lit up, and he shouted, "Who is this, asking such an excellent question?!"

The man stood, hands together, "I don’t know if it’s a good question, but I know the master has good answers."

He also exited.

A young man, fair-featured and elegant, entered after him. He placed a silver piece down and asked about the origins of a certain mountain and river deity.

The old monk shared some insights but candidly stated they were mostly borrowed from the writings of Confucian scholars, noting that there was some truth to them.

The old man didn’t mind, lamenting how there were too many foolish and stubborn individuals in the world, especially the younger scholars who were overly obsessed with fame and fortune...

The old monk merely listened to the other’s concerns about the world, and after a long while, smiled and asked, "What did you have for lunch today?"

The other replied with a smile, "Just the plain vegetarian meal from the White Cloud Temple."

The old monk nodded, saying, "Those used to rich meats will find plain meals unpalatable, but those who are not will simply find them hard to eat."

The other’s expression shifted slightly, and the old monk continued, "But those who are full will only annoy the hungry with their complaints about how the food is bad."

The elder rose, coldly laughing, "What kind of enlightened monk are you? Just a name without substance!"

The old monk collected the silver, smiling, "The silver is indeed real."

Afterward, a stout, burly man entered, seemingly timid, and said, "Great monk, I’m a butcher; will I still be able to be born as a human in my next life?"

The old monk asked, "Every day you kill and sell meat; what do you seek?"

The man hesitated a bit, muttering, "To earn money and support my family."

The old monk smiled, "Open your hand; I’ll take a look."

Ultimately, the man left with a smile.

Next came someone who hadn’t come to read palms at all but merely asked the old monk why he never referred to himself as "this poor monk," as it didn’t seem to align with Buddhist etiquette.

The old monk replied, "I possess wealth, albeit modest in spiritual understanding."

The man was taken aback, finding it amusing, and left satisfied.

A bashful young woman stood at the door, and the old monk smiled, "There’s no need for you to take off your shoes, young lady."

The young wife inquired if her son would be a scholar and whether he could achieve a degree.

The old monk extended his hand with a smile, but the woman blushed, extending her hand only to pull it back. The old monk glanced at his palm and lowered his hand, smiling, "In your eyes, there are men, but in my heart, there are no women. However, this kind of talk is something common monks cannot hear nor speak. It’s like the reasoning between you and your mother-in-law; many principles you can hear, but she cannot. What she can hear, you cannot. Often, both are sound arguments, depending on who is more willing to give way."

The woman was utterly astonished, nodding gently as if in realization. Yet she appeared troubled, bearing some resentment in her family. While she could endure it, her husband seemed to have some worries. He didn’t overly favor his mother-in-law but always sighed heavily when it came to her. It would have been nice if he could have said a kind word to her; she wouldn’t truly make things difficult for him.

The old monk chuckled, "Understanding the method of maintaining a harmonious relationship is one thing, but you still seek a way to resolve the pressing issues?"

The woman nodded vigorously, her smile radiant.

The old monk said, "With family values in place, there must be children. Your husband, at heart, is good. It’s just..."

The woman quickly waved her hands.

The old monk laughed, changing the subject, "But as the saying goes, when choosing a pig, look at the pen. Marriages, whether for women or men, are similar. As you are from a well-off family with children, it’s best to focus on raising them well. Don’t let your family’s daughter suffer in your home; don’t let your daughter become your mother-in-law in your eyes. That can be achieved if you wish. The reason I say this is that you likely have such thoughts already. I wouldn’t dare to speak so to any other woman who didn’t share a similar sentiment."

The woman performed a deep bow, thanking him before leaving. As she entered wearing shoes, the old monk reminded her to apologize.

The old monk smiled, saying, "The three families should thank you instead."

Then a young, handsome young master entered, offering silver and starting to inquire why the teachings in books seemed useless.

The old monk chuckled, "The teachings of Confucian sages have long been imparted with great care, but they ask for effort without asking about results. Yet when the books are closed, they only seek results and not the process. In the end, they complain that despite their extensive understanding of the principles in books, they cannot make their lives better. That doesn’t seem right, does it? In fact, if one’s life is good, and they still claim it is not, it’s even worse, right?"

Finally, the old monk asked, "Do you genuinely understand the principles?"

The young man, barely holding back his anger, declared, "How can I not know? I have read books that cover a myriad of philosophies, more than you’ve ever read!"

The old monk shook his head, "You may have read many books, but you don’t understand. In fact, you know less than those who have read few."

The young man, used to being pampered, grew increasingly obstinate, "I know! What can you do about it?"

The old monk engaged in a back-and-forth of repeated denials, insisting the young man did not know.

Of course, the old monk wouldn’t waste too much time with him, allowing the next guest to enter without delaying any business.

Suddenly, the young man said, "I don’t know."

While the old monk was conversing with another, he replied, "You don’t know a damn thing."

The young man, who had been eavesdropping outside, burst into laughter, "Hahaha, the bald donkey has committed the same offense!"

The old monk stared blankly at him.

"You come from a family of merchants; it’s been hard to cultivate such a bookish seed like you, hoping you’ll bring glory to the family name. Yet, with your mind so unclear, you indulge in fantasies of meeting noble patrons and rely on your elders to foster relationships. You bask in your good fortune, calm in public but ecstatic in private. On your travels, you hear tales of the river goddess’s romantic nature, sending correspondence to the temple only to be ignored. You pen flowery poems, asking your classmates for critiques, tarnishing the goddess’s reputation, which leads to her seeking accountability. Fortunately, you still carry a bit of your ancestors’ blessings, as the land god still remembers your family’s forebears and opens porridge kitchens during famines, helping the impoverished without asking for anything in return. Thus, he tries to soften the blow, despite the divide between the realms of the living and the dead. You remain blissfully unaware, while your family’s ancestral shrine has already been dismantled by your hands."

"With each retreat, I won’t say anything you can’t handle; I’ll only speak of what you can understand. If I truly have committed a verbal offense, your mouth and heart both curse me as a bald donkey, wouldn’t that increase your own karma? Thus, if you truly know so many principles, wouldn’t it be better for you to teach me?"

"You’re simply afraid of what I might know about your shady dealings. Now that we’re at this point, you still don’t want to face the truth—do you even know what you know?"

The young man suddenly changed from a seated position to kneeling, begging the old monk to save him from his plight.

The old monk said, "It’s better to seek yourself than to seek others."

"The world’s wealth has no distinction between clean and dirty; it’s the human heart that always holds a divide between right and wrong."

The young man only knelt and bowed, pleading endlessly.

The old monk scolded, "You only feel that there are no rights or wrongs in this world, merely positions? Just wait and see how long your arrogance and cleverness will last!"

---

The next person was also a traveler who had come here, noticing that the man looked to be around thirty. He had a dignified presence and smiled, "Monk, your chicken soup... tastes quite strange."

The old monk chuckled, "Please speak plainly if it doesn’t taste good. Most of the time, it only aggravates those who are annoyed and compounds the suffering of the distressed."

The man placed a silver coin down, "I believe the master truly possesses insight, but for many people’s troubles, if they aren’t very significant, why not impart a few simple techniques that yield immediate results? Wouldn’t that be more beneficial for spreading the teachings?"

The old monk shook his head, "For urgent ailments, there are plenty of apothecaries and doctors; what need have I? If you have no pressing matters, just eat more."

The man felt unsatisfied, his curiosity unquenched.

The old monk smiled, "The small troubles of common folk are hardly small, and how vast do you think my understanding of the Buddha’s teachings is? Can it truly yield immediate results? You’ve traveled far to sit here and say these words; how much joy and sorrow have you experienced? If you haven’t even developed a small trouble in your heart, then seeing this matter from a distance, it’s not trivial."

The man was left speechless, finding it hard to refute, shaking his head, "What I’ve seen, heard, learned, and contemplated in my life isn’t just for today’s exchange of wits with the master." 

The old monk waved his hand, "Then go elsewhere."

Throughout the day, the courtyard was bustling with people, lively and animated.

The last person of the day turned out to be the middle-aged head of the White Cloud Temple in the capital.

The second-to-last one was a transformed spirit.

Both the old monk and the middle-aged head were aware of each other’s presence.

The old monk had spoken only three sentences to the spirit.

"If there is a human heart, then there is humanity."

"Is the world vast? It’s only me and you."

"Are there many things in this world? Ultimately, it’s just a matter of gains and losses and personal feelings."

The middle-aged man removed his shoes before sitting down, not bowing at the door but rather offering a namaste in the Buddhist manner.

The old monk smiled, "There’s no need for the temple master to pay me a silver coin. In my eyes, I only see the flicker of the Buddha’s light in the hearts of sentient beings; I can’t see anything else, no spirits or monsters."

The middle-aged head smiled knowingly, lightly nodding.

The old monk continued, "I fear misunderstanding the Buddha’s teachings and misrepresenting them. I’m not afraid of teaching others the true value of the Buddha’s teachings; I am merely concerned with how to guide others on their first step, and how to proceed afterward. That is indeed challenging. It’s painful. A young novice may hold the Buddha in their heart, but may not be able to articulate the teachings. An elder monk may speak the teachings but may not truly hold the Buddha in their heart."

The middle-aged head spoke a couple of sentences.

Sudden enlightenment comes from gradual understanding.

Gradual understanding leads to sudden enlightenment.

The old monk lowered his head and joined his palms, "Amitabha. Well said."

---

In the Central Plains, an immortal arrived at a cave dwelling.

Beneath his feet lay an ancient bronze mirror the size of a hundred zhang, with twenty chairs arranged as if it were an Ancestor Hall.

Once this immortal appeared, he activated the ancient mirror formation. Within a single incense stick's time, one shadow after another floated in, taking their seats—over a dozen figures—but all their faces remained indistinct.

However, the two frontmost seats were unoccupied for the moment.

The crowd fell silent, communicating with their minds.

The one seated lowest among them was the first to speak, "Does our Qionglin Sect need to secretly push things along?"

The immortal, the host of this gathering, scoffed, "Fool! Secretly? What do you think, are those Confucian sages blind?"

The Qionglin Sect immortal fell silent, hastily rising to apologize to everyone.

Afterward, the crowd resumed speaking aloud.

The immortal addressed the sect leader of Qionglin, "Tell Xu Xuan that his ambitions are too grand for his current level; he’s not qualified to discuss this matter. As for He Xiaoliang from the Qingliang Sect, tell him not to provoke her."

The latter nodded in acknowledgment.

The immortal continued, "The Luoshui Pit indeed has variables; fortunately, we have no excessive entanglements with it. Besides, there have been anomalies occurring in the waters around Baoping Continent and Beijulu Continent."

One person laughed, "We are not the Rain Dragon Sect; we can just watch from the sidelines."

Another elder voice coldly chuckled, "I want to see how Chen Ping'an monopolizes the scholarly reputation."

The immortal paid no mind to these personal grievances, turning his gaze toward a woman dressed in traditional attire seated directly opposite him, frowning, "That area on Baoping Continent is your territory; have you nothing to say?"

The woman, with a red string tied around her wrist, smiled, "I really have nothing to say."

The immortal asked, "Who will investigate the origins of that book? If it can be of use to us, it would be best."

Someone responded, "I will go."

The woman smiled, "You truly have a keen sense."

The person replied nonchalantly, "If you didn’t have a good senior brother, you’d be dead long ago."

The woman gently swayed her wrist, "What a pity I do have one."

The immortal said, "Let’s continue discussing!"

The woman added, "I’ll give it a try; let Liu Xianyang go to Zhengyang Mountain first."

On the border of the Great Li, a group of playing children finally spotted a cloud of dust rising in the distance, instantly jumping and shouting.

A team of elite riders dashed by.

The children raced down the hillside.

One of the cavalrymen turned to look back, lightly tapping his fist against his chest. 

---

At the Wild World’s Tuo Yue Mountain, there was a slight tremor, which grew louder and louder, almost resembling the signs of a mountain collapsing.

Then, the Tuo Yue Mountain formation activated, and the entire mountain sank suddenly by several zhang without any further movement.

On the battlements of the Sword Qi Great Wall, a figure in a red cloak sat in meditation, seemingly lifeless. Suddenly, he stood up, laughing heartily, "Ah Liang, do come and visit sometime!"

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 812: A New Alchemist in the Mortal Realm**

In the fifth realm of the world, a celestial curtain opened, revealing two young Daoists stepping forth. One wore a lotus crown atop his head while the other donned heavenly robes, a traveler's cap, and cloud shoes. They appeared to be of similar age; the former was nominally there to protect the latter, but in truth, he was reluctant to venture into the outer heavens to slay the foreign demons.

Daoists from the Qingming Realm were required to adhere strictly to the prescribed attire, with no exceptions permitted. However, the traveler's cap and cloud shoes were exceptions to this rule. Regardless of their lineage or sect, as long as they were recorded in the Daoist annals, they could wear these items. It was said that this decree came directly from the Dao Ancestor to encourage practitioners to travel the mountains and rivers, cultivate virtue, and maintain purity.

Once the celestial curtain unfurled, the young Daoist in the lotus crown began to reinforce the barrier of the grand gate behind him, tracing symbols in the air with his fingers.

Aside from the White Jade Capital, numerous major sects, including Xuandu Temple and Suichu Palace, had been allocated a specific number of spots to enter this new realm for training and cultivation. Their goal was to establish their own sects in this foreign land. 

This time, the Confucianists had single-handedly opened the fifth realm. Logically, the Confucian Temple should monopolize this territory, while other sects would have to take their time to claim it. However, the Central Plains Confucian Temple permitted the Qingming Realm and the Lotus Realm to each establish a foothold here. Within a hundred years, practitioners from the lower five realms who received permission from their respective realms could enter gradually, but the total number could not exceed three thousand. Once the quota was reached, the gates would close, only to reopen after a hundred years. As for the circumstances at that time, it would require further discussions among the Confucian Temple, White Jade Capital, and the Buddhist Kingdom.

A young attendant with a colorful rattle tied to his waist emerged from the grand gate, looking around. Behind him hung a large golden gourd.

The young Daoist in the traveler's cap greeted the little attendant with a bow, but the latter waved his hand dismissively, speaking with an air of wisdom, "Since we're not from the same lineage, and your master and my master are sworn enemies, currently bickering in the Lotus Cave, it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to maintain a good relationship. If we were to turn against each other in the future, it could lead to a life-and-death struggle, and that would be quite unpleasant."

The Daoist drawing symbols smiled, "Since we're not in the White Jade Capital, we can speak freely. Feel free to ask any questions."

The little attendant asked, "Why did the Confucian Temple voluntarily allow six thousand foreign practitioners into this realm, competing for fortune? If the Confucian sages are watching closely, even if you at the White Jade Capital employ some sneaky methods to smuggle your favored individuals here, the numbers are still limited, and you wouldn’t dare to brazenly expand your territory. Over time, the cultivators from the Haoran Realm will surely establish a foothold here, seizing the advantages of time, location, and harmony. How can the other two realms compete for the resources suitable for cultivation?"

The three were none other than the three supreme leaders of the White Jade Capital: Lu Chen, his little junior brother Tian Shanqing—whose formal name was different on the White Jade Capital's annals, but he was simply referred to as Shanqing in the outside world—and lastly, a fire attendant from the Eastern Sea Daoist Temple. The connection between the Lotus Cave's "Lotus Flower Paradise" and the other realms had been divided into four parts: the old Daoist from the Eastern Sea took one, while the others were given to Lu Chen to annoy him, and one was assigned to the young Daoist disguised as a demon from Tai Ping Mountain, who later brought the entire paradise to the Qingming Realm to consult with the Dao Ancestor.

Lu Chen countered, "Does the Haoran Realm have all the various schools present? What about other places?"

The little attendant replied, "Isn't the Sage of Confucius getting old and muddled? Or is he just trying to take it easy, letting others handle what he can't manage?"

Lu Chen chuckled softly, "Scholars value cultivation and governance; they aren't looking to enjoy life like emperors. For a poor family, fishing is merely to fill the stomach. If an ordinary family has a large tank to raise fish, their knowledge lies in feeding and taking care of them, observing their life and death, and enjoying their leisurely existence while worrying about mortality. For wealthy households, if they have a few acres of ponds, their true concerns no longer lie in feeding but rather in instructing their servants not to forget to buy and release fish. Their enjoyment is merely in appreciating and fishing for fish. When one possesses a large lake, what is the joy? It’s simply allowing nature to take its course, occasionally catching big fish. The real concerns lie in the river's changing course and the uncertainties of drought and flood. The difference with the Haoran Realm's Confucian Temple is that they do not mind outsiders using their bamboo to make rods and fishing in their waters."

The little attendant frowned. "Could you explain it more simply?"

Lu Chen smiled, "Can heaven be lowered, earth elevated, or death avoided without cultivation?"

The little attendant, unwilling to engage in further philosophical discussions with the three supreme leaders, jumped a couple of times and complained, "I heard the old scholar is working hard here; why hasn't he come to greet me?"

Lu Chen laughed, "If the old scholar truly comes, I will have to avoid him."

The little attendant remarked, "The old scholar just aligns with the Dao of heaven and earth; his combat skills aren't impressive at all."

Shanqing added, "My little junior brother isn't afraid, but with three thousand Daoists coming here to cultivate, there will certainly be many bumps along the way."

The little attendant nodded vigorously in agreement, "The old scholar's biggest flaw is holding grudges. A gentleman should be cautious when alone, but he has never been! The old scholar stepped into heaven without ever having held the title of a sage."

Once, between Tongye Island and Baoping Island, the fire attendant stood still, obediently accepting punishment from the old scholar, who used a branch as a ruler, punishing him severely under the pretext of improper conduct.

Lu Chen reinforced the grand gate and turned to gaze at this realm. For countless years, the heavens and earth had remained unpushed and self-sustaining; the sun and moon shone without any one igniting them, and the stars were arranged in their patterns without being organized by anyone.

What the future holds remains uncertain.

Suddenly, Lu Chen laughed, "What a remarkable moment! Bai Ye, unmatched in poetry, reveling in the mortal realm."

Even though suppressed by the Great Dao, Lu Chen's ascension after "falling" was not easily comparable to that of ordinary ascendants. Even from a great distance, he could see the scholar wielding a celestial sword, the momentum of his strike overwhelming. Lu Chen was able to catch glimpses of the situation, but getting too close would only lead to unnecessary trouble. After all, Bai Ye was accompanied by the old scholar, and Lu Chen bore a lifelong grudge against the old scholar's favored disciple. While his senior brother was embroiled in the battle of the Great Dao with Qi Jingchun, the one least favored was Lu Chen himself. With the five cities and twelve towers of the White Jade Capital, he often found himself the most idle, and his second senior brother had a notoriously bad temper, which meant that crucial tasks fell to him, the little junior brother.

Fortunately, now that he had a disciple, Lu Chen hoped that the young man in the traveler's cap beside him would grow quickly so that he wouldn’t have to work so hard in the future.

The little attendant glanced at Lu Chen and said, "No wonder you're so honest; are you worried that here, the Great Dao will suppress you, and then that person will chop you down with a few strikes?"

Lu Chen chuckled, "Thus, I have my own clever plans."

An old Daoist emerged from the grand gate, and the little attendant hurriedly hid behind Shanqing. This old Daoist, Sun, was not someone to provoke lightly.

At present, in the Qingming Realm, it was time for Daoist Second to oversee the White Jade Capital. The responsibility for opening the gate fell to Lu Chen and the head of Xuandu Temple, Sun Huai Zhong. The relationship between Lu Chen and the old head wasn’t particularly good, but it wasn’t bad either; they got along well enough. Otherwise, if Sun and Lu Chen teamed up, the safety of this new realm would be at stake. If, at that moment, the scholar who had been dissuaded earlier grew furious, it would jeopardize their relationship with Xuandu Temple. Adding the old scholar's instigation, it was likely Bai Ye would draw his sword and go straight to the Qingming Realm, causing Daoist Second and Sun to wreak havoc in the new world and forcing the Qingming Realm to return what it had taken.

As soon as Sun stepped through the grand gate, he raised an eyebrow, exclaiming, "How long has it been? The first Yu Pu Realm practitioner has already emerged? What incredible talent must be required for such an achievement? Remarkable, truly remarkable! It seems as if the world has just begun, and such fortune is already at hand, favored by this realm. The journey of the Great Dao is truly a testament to the Great Dao."

Not just any Yuanying Realm practitioner, nor any common top-tier cultivator from their hometown, could easily ascend to the Yu Pu Realm upon arriving in this world. Every practitioner who came here would inevitably be suppressed by this realm, most taking time to align with the currents of the Great Dao before they had any hope of breaking through.

Sun turned to the young Daoist in the traveler's cap and smiled, "How does it feel to have someone beat you to it?"

Shanqing first bowed respectfully to the old Daoist before replying, "This little one dares not compete with the fate of the Great Dao."

Sun chuckled, "Opportunities are fleeting; now is the time to speak lightly. In the future, you will understand what it means to be a step behind, always a step behind. Even in ancient times, it was still like this. Do you truly think that today, the order of things isn’t important?"

The little attendant nodded, "As a sword cultivator, becoming the first Yu Pu Realm practitioner grants all sword cultivators a measure of benefit. The rise of the Sword Qi Great Wall becomes even more imperative."

Sun shot a sidelong glance at the little rascal. "What useless chatter are you spouting?"

The little attendant, embarrassed and angry, retorted, "Even a blind fool knows that the first Yu Pu Realm practitioner in the world is favored by the heavens. Isn't that obvious? You can spout nonsense, but I can't?"

In an instant, Sun was at the little attendant's side, his hand pressing down on the latter's head, explaining, "My realm is high, so what I say, even if it seems trivial, carries the weight of true words."

The little attendant, unable to avoid the old Daoist's hand, felt as if a mountain pressed down on him, his head spinning and soul trembling. Fortunately, Sun shook the little attendant's head away, causing him to stagger back a few steps. Sun smiled, "Since your master dares to debate with the Dao Ancestor, I won't hold you accountable for the matter of stealing peach branches."

Lu Chen turned his gaze towards the city, saying, "From all directions, the geography is meticulously surveyed. Behind, sword cultivators are systematically placing suppressive objects in the towering mountains and vast rivers, leaving their marks on the landscape. Given this, won't their expansion speed be too fast? Not to mention what will happen in the future, just within a hundred years, they will become the greatest force in this realm. The only limitation is that the city's population cannot keep up. However, once the three major doors of the Haoran Realm open, with countless lower five realm practitioners and common folk flooding in, as long as these young sword cultivators operate effectively, the future of sword cultivators is boundless."

However, Lu Chen was well aware that the sword cultivators, aside from having a somewhat favorable impression of the Southern Posa Realm, held a poor view of both Tongye Island and Fuyiao Island. Thus, the city would certainly be reluctant to take in too many people from the three realms of Haoran.

Perhaps this was the cycle of fortune; what goes around comes around. But if the young sword cultivators were too vengeful and acted impulsively within a hundred years, heavily suppressing the practitioners and commoners of the three realms, the tides of fortune would also shift, quietly drifting away.

Sun sneered, "This was the intention of the Confucian Temple, to give the Sword Qi Great Wall a fair chance. What can you, Lu Chen, do about it? If you're unconvinced, go seek reason from the old scholar? I can accompany you and guarantee Bai Ye won’t draw his sword. How about that?"

Lu Chen laughed, "No need."

From a distance, the scholar asked, "What are you mumbling about?"

The old scholar replied, "To do good to others is the way, without any ulterior motives."

Within the city, four schools began to be established, marking an unprecedented event in the long history of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The teachers were mostly old sword cultivators of not particularly high realms, and the dozen or so instructors were selected from the Hidden Official lineage, primarily to impart the foundational knowledge of Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism to the students, making it simple and comprehensible. As for how the young students would initially learn to read and write, stone tablets placed throughout the city had already been gathered by the Summer Palace. Moreover, there were strict rules regarding the instructors teaching knowledge, such as prohibiting them from discussing the moral judgments of the Haoran Realm or their personal likes and dislikes, and not delving too deeply into the grievances between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Haoran Realm.

The teachers only taught. As for the instructors outside of the school, they were free to speak as they pleased.

The sword cultivators of the Judicial Officers lineage had many objections, believing that the choice of teachers for imparting knowledge should not be solely determined by the Hidden Official lineage. Even if the Hidden Official lineage held the majority, the Judicial Officers should be involved as well, and not completely excluded. This led to a dispute, and the first meeting of the Ancestor Hall was convened specifically to discuss this small matter.

The sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage mostly went out to survey the terrain, and after receiving the news via flying swords, only Guo Zhujiu and Gu Jianlong returned to the city.

In contrast, the Judicial Officers lineage had a dozen members, all Earth Immortal sword cultivators. However, the two leaders, Qi Shou and Nian Xin, were absent. Qi Shou was outside the city, personally overseeing the establishment of the first mountain stronghold. As for Nian Xin, aside from occasionally teaching martial arts to the old Martial Arts practitioners of the Summer Palace, she had been wandering and clearly showed no inclination to involve herself in the authority of the Judicial Officers lineage. Consequently, the largest and most powerful Judicial Officers lineage effectively divided into three factions. The faction led by Qi Shou had nearly gathered half of the Sword Qi Great Wall's combat power, while the remaining two factions were led by two old Yuan Ying sword cultivators, who were mostly elderly and not on good terms with Qi Shou. Lastly, there was Nian Xin, who, along with a dozen seemingly inconsequential children, had become a somewhat comical "child king" as the second-in-command of the Judicial Officers.

However, in the city, the future cultivation paths would diverge into three: sword cultivators, followed by other Qi cultivators, and lastly, pure martial artists.

In reality, every recent breakthrough for both sword cultivators and pure martial artists was a matter of great import. The former was somewhat better, as aside from Ning Yao stepping into the Yu Pu Realm, there were sword cultivators of all realms. As the first to break through a certain realm in this new world, their fortune would ultimately be limited. However, for pure martial artists, there were abundant opportunities! This was because, in the past, the martial artists of the Summer Palace had reached a maximum of only the third realm, which meant that in the future, every realm would be the first of its kind in this world. Essentially, advancing one realm would elevate martial arts in the fifth realm. Though this realm might not offer the same martial fortune as the other realms, it seemed as if the martial spirit was present and the spiritual beings were protecting them, favoring this realm. As for how the martial artists would break through, it all depended on which of those twelve children would be the first to reach the higher realms, especially the seventh realm of martial arts. Whoever first attained the Golden Body Realm would certainly bring forth celestial phenomena, making it highly anticipated.

Now, within and outside the city, regardless of whether one was a sword cultivator, everyone was full of vitality. Even those old practitioners whose physiques were decaying and realms stagnant felt like withered trees encountering spring, eager to live a few more years and do a few more things for the younger generations and children.

During today’s meeting in the Ancestor Hall, Gu Jianlong, who had returned to the city dusty and tired, voiced many fair opinions.

Guo Zhujiu, resting his mountain staff across his knees, felt somewhat fatigued and dozed off, resembling a chick pecking at rice.

The Judicial Officers lineage and the Hidden Official lineage were having a heated argument, with the latter being a mere observer. This young Yuan Ying, holding significant power, was responsible for managing the treasury, including the sword workshop, clothing workshop, and pill workshop, all merged into one under his command. He had assigned a group of ordinary accounting practitioners to manage the funds. Even if a sword cultivator were chosen, they would be regarded as a lowly and undesirable position. However, the one managing the funds had never refused any financial requests from the Judicial Officers lineage for their expansion.

In short, the one managing all the divine funds and assets was looked down upon by the sword cultivators.

Gu Jianlong spoke fairly and engaged in a war of words, not backing down.

Guo Zhujiu sleepily opened his eyes, rubbed his face, and asked softly, “Is it still not over?”

Gu Jianlong turned to him and said, “Not yet. There’s still a lot to discuss. That kid Xuanzhu was right; in his hometown, the arguments in the Ancestor Hall are determined by who talks more and who shouts louder.”

Guo Zhujiu crossed his arms and frowned. “The establishment of schools and teachers was our Hidden Official lineage's intention. Even a fool would know whose idea it was. Are we trying to rebel now that my master and mistress are not around?”

Gu Jianlong had just recounted a plethora of fair arguments, yet he dared not say this particular line.

The atmosphere in the Ancestor Hall suddenly became quite strange.

A young Golden Core sword cultivator from the Judicial Officers lineage couldn’t help but speak up, “Guo Zhujiu, don’t take it too seriously. This is just a small matter.”

Gu Jianlong reminded, “Green Duan, refrain from mentioning your master. Didn’t the Hidden Official say that the more you talk about him once you leave the Summer Palace, the more irritable the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage will become?”

At this point, Gu Jianlong sighed inwardly. Back then, he didn’t know what “leaving the Summer Palace” truly meant; now he understood that it referred to the two realms.

Guo Zhujiu nodded and looked towards the sword cultivators from the Judicial Officers lineage across the room. “Then you have the numbers; you get to decide.”

This made the sword cultivators of the Judicial Officers lineage exchange glances, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.

Guo Zhujiu continued, “But you can’t stop the children from reading that book…”

The Duke of Gaoyuan finally spoke for the first time: “It has already been banned. If I’m not mistaken, one of the reasons from the Judicial Officers lineage was that the customs and traditions of the Haoran Realm would be too dirty for their eyes. Anyone who dares to sell this book will be expelled from the city.”

This book contained various stories about landscapes, compiled into a single volume. Through one tale after another, it linked together the experiences of travel, and beyond the stories, it hid the customs and traditions of the Haoran Realm. There were mountain spirits and river deities, the literary and martial temples, and the customs of setting off firecrackers, posting spring couplets, the twenty-four solar terms, the Kitchen God, the intricacies of officialdom, the rules of the martial world, marriage rituals, literary exchanges, poetry, and the rituals of both water and land temples, as well as the grand ceremonies... In short, the vast world had no shortage of wonders, and it was all documented in the book.

This was produced by the young Hidden Official, who had spent his time in the Summer Palace with nothing to do, allowing all the outside sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage, including Lin Junbi and Deng Liang, to narrate their experiences while the Hidden Official personally recorded and compiled it. Thus, the book, sprawling over four hundred thousand words, was signed with the name of the Summer Palace.

Guo Zhujiu reiterated, “You have the numbers; you get to decide.”

Gu Jianlong felt a surge of anger and decided to stop speaking fairly.

Guo Zhujiu had already stood up, holding his staff, and said to Gu Jianlong, “I’m leaving.”

Gu Jianlong stood up and gave a thumbs-up to the group of sword cultivators across the room.

Due to the small number of Hidden Official lineage members, and with the Duke of Gaoyuan’s accountants being even fewer, the two sides stood facing each other, like a standoff.

On the plaza outside the Ancestor Hall, a brilliant sword light appeared in an instant as Ning Yao flew in on her sword, having traveled tens of thousands of miles. 

In her hand, she held a grotesque head, stained with dried blood, resembling something that was neither human nor beast, exuding a strong aura of ancient wilderness. 

Ning Yao casually tossed the head onto the ground.

Everyone within the Ancestor Hall stood up.

Guo Zhujiu frowned, feeling somewhat wronged.

Ning Yao paused, walked over to the little girl, and patted Guo Zhujiu's head, but then turned to Gu Jianlong and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Gu Jianlong instinctively took a step back, feeling a mix of indignation and frustration, and said in a deep voice, “The Judicial Officers lineage holds objections regarding the schools and books.”

Ning Yao nodded, standing at the threshold, just a step away from entering the Ancestor Hall. “Anyone with objections, take a seat again. I’ll reason with you. Those without objections, get out of the Ancestor Hall.”

In the end, the Ancestor Hall was left empty.

The sword cultivators of the Judicial Officers lineage mostly lowered their heads and slipped out.

Ning Yao stepped into the Ancestor Hall, took the seat of the Hidden Official, and began to meditate, “Flying Sword, summon Qi Shou.”

Moments later, Qi Shou arrived on his sword.

He was swiftly struck down by Ning Yao’s sword.

With a bitter smile, Qi Shou didn’t even go to the Ancestor Hall, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and flew away from the city to continue overseeing the construction of the mountain stronghold.

His injuries were not severe, but not light either.

Guo Zhujiu and Gu Jianlong sat on the steps outside the Ancestor Hall, feeling an inexplicable sense of dissatisfaction.

Gu Jianlong was also deep in thought. The Hidden Official had once stated that the world was complex and people's hearts were unstable; in chaotic times, one must not think too much, only care about survival. On the contrary, in peaceful times, there are often two situations: one is that comfort breeds complacency, and the other is that abundance brings knowledge of propriety. Perhaps today, Qi Shou was intentionally leading this sword strike. If his swordsmanship was destined to be inferior to Ning Yao's, he would just have to feign pity to win people's hearts. When it came to realms, he could slowly wear them down; the gap in swordsmanship between Qi Shou and Ning Yao could easily be compensated for by the power of the Judicial Officers lineage.

As for why Ning Yao had not directly become the leader of the Judicial Officers lineage, not even the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, including Gu Jianlong, could fully understand. Perhaps it was that the great sword immortal had some profound plan with the Hidden Official, which could only be explained that way.

However, the Judicial Officers lineage would not have it easy either. After losing the “Sword Qi Great Wall,” the number of children born in the city becoming sword cultivators would dwindle, while more would turn to other forms of cultivation and pure martial arts, naturally increasing in number. Moreover, on the very first day of the new Judicial Officers lineage’s establishment, there was an ironclad rule: only sword cultivators could serve as members of the Judicial Officers lineage. In contrast, the Hidden Official lineage had no such restrictions. Currently, the only issue was that Nian Xin's identity was shrouded in mystery, and her stance was unclear. If she chose to ally with Qi Shou, the Hidden Official lineage would have a headache. It was only a matter of time before the number of Qi cultivators and martial artists surpassed that of sword cultivators within the city. 

If the faction of the Judicial Officers lineage led by Nian Xin continued to work closely with Qi Shou, the future dynamics in and outside the city could gradually develop into a struggle for Qi cultivators for the Hidden Official lineage, while the Judicial Officers lineage would dominate all martial artists...

Gu Jianlong had been in the Summer Palace for many years, mingling with the likes of Lin Junbi and Cao Gun, who were close friends, and could foresee these hidden dangers early on.

Ning Yao stood on the steps, smiling, and said, “You all don’t need to worry. I will maintain a distance of two realms from all sword cultivators. After that…”

Implying that before Qi Shou and the Duke of Gaoyuan reached the Yu Pu Realm, she, Ning Yao, would become the first immortal cultivator in this realm, a sword cultivator!

Guo Zhujiu jumped up, overjoyed, and replied, “Master should go see Mistress!”

Ning Yao said to Guo Zhujiu, “During my travels, I have some insights to share. You, Green Duan, write it down. Then we will publish it under the name of the Hidden Official lineage and distribute it.”

Guo Zhujiu leaned on his staff, “Understood, I will comply!”

Gu Jianlong, on the other hand, had to play the laborer and picked up the grotesque head that Ning Yao had casually thrown on the ground.

Ning Yao took Guo Zhujiu and flew to the Ning residence on her sword.

First came the Sword Qi Great Wall, then him, henceforth, Ning Yao would wield her sword without restraint.

Ning Yao cast a glance at the celestial curtain but did not speak.

Who goes to find whom is uncertain.

On Lu Hua Island.

The great demon Qie Yun lamented, “Junior brother, why do you abandon the splendid Sword Qi Great Wall and come to this shabby place to set up residence? Isn’t that a bit too shabby? Wouldn’t it be better to find a sect relic when we reach Tongye Island?”

The junior brother of Qie Yun was none other than the foremost sword immortal of Tuo Yue Mountain, Fei Ran.

In the past, on the battlefield, with Nan Shouchen and Bei Yingguan, there was also Fei Ran, who was considered a comrade of sorts.

Fei Ran and Qie Yun were now in the Transformation Cave on Lu Hua Island, but the major demon who had occupied it for many years had unfortunately been dealt with by them, and they swiftly executed him.

Fei Ran said, “I was injured by Wei Jin’s sword on the battlefield before, and I need to recuperate here.”

After checking out the Transformation Cave, they left together and arrived at the high peak of Lu Hua Island. Because this place had been taken under Fei Ran's wing, all the inhabitants of Lu Hua Island had been spared from calamity. Naturally, those who sought death were dealt with by Qie Yun. Compared to the Rain Dragon Sect, the situation on the small Lu Hua Island was significantly better. In the Rain Dragon Sect, those killed by Qie Yun and Xiao Xian had been taken under the command of the major demon Bai Ying. As for the female cultivators flayed by Qie Yun, they were alive and transformed into servants of the throne.

Fei Ran looked eastward and asked with a smile, “Senior brother, after Qinghua and Jiuye, have you thought of a new name?”

Qie Yun nodded, “Lu Chen is a good name, but it’s not quite fitting at the moment. Let’s decide when we get closer to the Central Divine Continent.”

The name Qinghua was chosen to witness the Sword Qi Great Wall shatter like a piece of blue-and-white porcelain. 

After breaking the Sword Qi Great Wall, the name Jiuye was adopted, naturally because of the abundance of fine wine and beautiful women in the Haoran Realm.

In the South Posa Realm where Chen Chunan resided, and in the southwestern Fuyiao Realm, the situation had previously been quite chaotic. The direction in which both sides were now looking was the southeast, towards Tongye Island.

The Yu Guizong and Tongye Sect echoed each other from north to south, while the Fuji Sect and Tai Ping Mountain corresponded from east to west. They were all engaged in extensive construction, hastily establishing a huge formation.

Fei Ran asked, “Isn’t it a bit self-defeating for the Confucian Temple to grant such power to the world, leading to today’s embarrassing situation?”

Qie Yun replied, “What does it matter? After the Haoran Realm changes its master, apart from a few peak powers, life up there will definitely not be as comfortable as it is now.”

Fei Ran shifted his gaze towards the South Posa Realm, saying, “Poor Chen Chunan.”

With or without Chen Chunan personally stationed there, the difference was like heaven and earth.

Qie Yun nodded with a smile, “Let’s not attack the South Posa Realm just yet; instead, we’ll split our forces to attack Tongye Island and Fuyiao Island. Chen Chunan will soon find himself in a dilemma: should he defend one realm’s safety or risk his reputation by stepping out to send himself to death, thereby jeopardizing South Posa Realm? Just wait and see the show unfold. While Chen Chunan may disregard the discussions among those scholars of the Central Plains, all those cultivators associated with Tongye and Fuyiao will certainly feel deeply hurt, and the decent ones will surely curse the entire Chen family of the Confucianists.”

Fei Ran remarked, “The only significant disadvantage lies in the timing and geography; not speaking of people, it’s that the Wild Realm wants to ascend, and everywhere is equivalent to the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Those practitioners who occupied the mountain tops, especially the three holy beings, along with the military strategists, academies, Daoist temples, and battlefield relics, each of their locations was a small world in itself.

Moreover, there was a silently vast realm of protection surrounding them.

In the South Posa Realm, Fuyiao Realm, and Tongye Realm, all the holy beings overseeing the celestial curtain had already descended into the mortal realm. 

Unlike the three holy beings of the Sword Qi Great Wall, these beings were far more direct. Without exception, they chose to die and dissipate their Dao to protect the mountains and rivers of their respective islands.

Not only that, but several saints from the Golden Armored Continent also rushed to the South Posa Realm and Fuyiao Realm, falling into the mortal realm. However, the two sages from the Baoping Continent still had not made any moves.

Qie Yun scoffed, “Junior brother, don’t insult the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Fei Ran chuckled, “You have a point.”

Qie Yun continued, “Bai Ying, Yang Zhi, Fei Fei, Huang Luan—these four are bound by limitations at the Sword Qi Great Wall, but once they reach the Haoran Realm, they would easily rake in achievements. It’s a pity that Huang Luan’s luck is too poor; otherwise, with his expertise in breaking formations, he could easily accumulate merits.”

Yang Zhi and Fei Fei were both great demons recognized by the throne, masters of the waterway. The vast sea was not only suitable for assisting in road opening but also perfect for impacting the fate of a realm's mountains and rivers. Huang Luan could help “open the door,” and once they gained a foothold, it would be time for Bai Ying to showcase his divine powers after each major battle. However, that white ape had just fallen short of killing the gentleman from the Great Fushu Academy, Zhong Kui, which presented a bit of a problem.

Additionally, the disappearance of the Zhuoshui Pit was an unexpected surprise.

But it wasn't a significant issue; that Tongye Island simply couldn’t hold out for long.

Fei Ran whispered, “The Sword Qi Great Wall's Chen Ping'an, with Tongye Island at the sides, and the Baoping Continent's Cui Zhan.”

Qie Yun laughed, “In any case, they will all die.”

At the cliffside of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Li Zhen stood nearest to a figure in a gray robe—the closest group of sword cultivators, including Liu Bai, Yu Si, and Tan, were all budding sword immortals from the Jia Shen camp. Only Zhu Ke was not practicing his sword atop the city wall; he had followed his master to the Haoran Realm, where it was rumored that the big bearded man was preparing to strike at Chen Chunan of the South Posa Realm.

Li Zhen smiled and asked, “Senior Long Jun, why not cross this city wall? In the Haoran Realm, there are plenty of worthy opponents for Senior Long Jun to challenge, like Chen Chunan or Xun Yuan of Tongye Island.”

Long Jun raspily replied, “You will die.”

He continued, “So, you budding sword immortals should hurry up and break through, capturing a share of the sword Dao’s fortune. When I grow impatient, all those who have yet to break through and have not grasped a bit of sword intent will have to eat a sword from me. Spread the word.”

Li Zhen felt a chill. Eating a sword from Long Jun? That’s not for him.

Li Zhen found the thought frightening. Was that dead Chen Qingdu still holding some hidden power?

Li Zhen gazed into the distance, frowning. Could it be that?

If that were the case, why didn’t Long Jun strike back when he offered him a sword earlier?

Li Zhen's thoughts raced, and he curiously asked, “Why did you tell me this?”

Long Jun replied, “You don’t consider yourself an observer, but I regard you as one.”

Li Zhen chuckled, “Only you, Senior Long Jun, could say such things without me getting angry.”

Previously, at Li Zhen's suggestion, the Jia Zi camp had already issued orders prohibiting all demons from approaching the other half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, ensuring that the person would not have the chance to temper their physique. Moreover, that person could only watch the flow of the wild demons beneath their feet, glancing around, which was bothersome. If they didn’t look, it would seem as though they were the only one in the world. Didn’t they love to show off? Ever since ancient times, sages and heroes have all been lonely, allowing Chen Ping'an to take center stage.

Li Zhen approached the cliff’s edge and shouted, “Hidden Official, care for a chat?!”

Long Jun replied, “Stop shouting. He just broke through to the Golden Core and then shattered it again, preparing for Yuan Ying. He’s too busy to bother with you. Once he reaches the Yuan Ying realm, I suggest you avoid wandering around here.”

Li Zhen was stunned for a long time. A month ago, while he was practicing his sword here, that guy had just stabilized his soul, finally appearing somewhat normal, and that very day he stepped into the Ocean Viewing Realm. Now he was rushing towards Yuan Ying? Was this like having one bowl of food after another? Moreover, what was this nonsense about breaking through and shattering the Golden Core to re-establish it?!

Atop the high cliffs, a striking figure in a bright red robe suddenly appeared in Li Zhen's line of sight. The figure leaned on a long knife, smiling, and said, “Does your son advise his grandson not to seek death? Did you ask your ancestors for permission?”

Li Zhen shook his head regretfully, “It seems I can’t visit the Hidden Official often in the future.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “No worries. Once I accidentally step into the Yu Pu realm, I’ll come visit you.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 813: The Summit of the Highest Mountain**

The heavy rain poured down as a man stepped out of a thatched cottage by the riverside, moving through the curtain of rain without getting a single drop on his clothes.

Raindrops the size of soybeans pelted the river's surface, creating a cacophony of sound. With the rain and the night enveloping the world, the atmosphere grew increasingly dark and somber.

In its prime, the Tongye Sect ruled over an expansive territory of over twelve hundred miles, akin to a dynasty among mortals. This vast domain was rich in spiritual energy (Qi) and was ideal for cultivation. However, after a calamity struck, the once-mighty sect saw its influence wane as numerous vassal forces broke away, dramatically reducing its territory. The remaining factions faced three choices: one was to establish their own sects, renegotiating the ancient alliance with the Tongye Sect to become allies instead of vassals, claiming a piece of land once designated by the sect without having to pay any tribute; others chose to directly align themselves with the Jade Gui Sect or forge contracts with neighboring dynasties, becoming their protectors.

As the rain subsided, three guests approached the thatched cottage. One was a purple-robed immortal—Fu Lingqing, the current sect leader of the Tongye Sect—who had clashed with the man beside him on several occasions. Fu Lingqing had forcibly broken through to the immortal realm, but this came at the cost of his potential, leaving him forever stuck at the Immortal level. His breakthrough had been a desperate measure; without a strong immortal at the helm, the Tongye Sect could not hope to maintain its precarious ancestral legacy. This highlighted the contrasting personalities of Fu Lingqing and the sect's former founder, Du Mao.

Flanking Fu Lingqing were a young man and woman. The woman wore a gown of golden threads and a water-red silk skirt, draped with a mist-like dragon maiden's robe called the Xiangshui skirt. On her feet were embroidered shoes named Yuxin, crafted from a paradise of blooms.

The dashing young man named Li Wanyong bore a long sword on his back, known as "Chizhuan," a rare and formidable weapon of the Tongye Sect.

Along with Yuxin and the sword cultivator Li Wanyong, Du Yan and Qin Shuihu formed the four prodigies of the new generation of the Tongye Sect, rapidly rising in their cultivation. This was the hallmark of a great sect's foundation.

Despite the Tongye Sect's damaged vitality, if one were to set aside timing and location, they were only outmatched by the Jade Gui Sect in terms of practitioners. The only missing pieces were Jiang Shangzhen, a sect leader with a promising future, and Wei Ying, a gifted lower sect leader. Excluding them, the Tongye Sect retained significant strengths in other areas, maintaining a competitive status with the Jade Gui Sect. As for the scattered offerings and guest cultivators at the upper five realms, as long as the four prodigies could successfully advance, especially Li Wanyong to the Jade Purity Realm (Yupujing), they would be able to return without damaging their relationships.

As Fu Lingqing approached, he greeted the man beside him respectfully as "Mr. Zuo."

Zuo nodded in acknowledgment.

Fu Lingqing continued, "All ferry boats, talisman boats, and any resources within reach for qi practitioners across the entire continent, including those of the Tongye Sect, have been requisitioned by the Academy. They are working as much as possible to evacuate coastal citizens to safety. Some sects, in their pursuit of self-preservation, are unwilling to contribute wholeheartedly; this is unfortunately unavoidable. After some admonishments from the gentlemen of the Academy, we can only say there has been a slight improvement, but the overall situation remains dire. However, Jiang Shangzhen has already taken the lead in unlocking the restrictions of the Yunkui Blessed Land, allowing for the mass acceptance of citizens from the Jade Gui Sect's territory. As for the Four Symbols Great Formation, it can be activated at any time to resist the invading demon forces, thus altering the balance of timing and location."

Speaking of Jiang Shangzhen and the Yunkui Blessed Land, Fu Lingqing felt a twinge of admiration. Once a large influx of commoners entered, the spiritual energy of the land would gradually be divided and diluted, reducing the originally high-quality blessed land to a mere middle-grade one. This "dilution" was almost irreversible, as the rank of a blessed land was essentially determined by the spiritual energy generated through divine funds; once the energy was depleted by countless ordinary folks, it could only be spread thinly, offering negligible benefits such as longevity. For practitioners of the blessed land, it felt like the heavens were closing in, with the path of enlightenment becoming increasingly stifling and achievements steadily diminishing.

If Fu Lingqing were to oversee the Yunkui Blessed Land, merely suppressing the local practitioners would be a formidable challenge.

Tongye Continent's practitioners had a historical reputation for taking care of their own affairs. For instance, even now, there was no intercontinental ferry on Tongye Continent, while the small Baoping Continent had several. Furthermore, no sword cultivators would venture to the Sword Qi Great Wall for training, and the lower sects of the righteous world had never chosen Tongye Continent as their location, among other things.

Zuo remarked, "At least Jiang Shangzhen has done something worthwhile."

Regarding human affairs.

Had he known this would be the case, Zuo should have been more courteous with his sword salute when passing through the Shinjing City of the Great Spring Dynasty.

Fu Lingqing did not respond, as Jiang Shangzhen was currently the leader of the Jade Gui Sect. Although the highest realm practitioner remained the old sect leader, Xun Yuan, according to the rules of the mountain, Jiang Shangzhen was, in name, the undisputed leader among the immortals of the continent, much like Fu Lingqing once was. Fu Lingqing understood that in a peaceful world, this empty title could greatly benefit a sect; however, in the tumultuous world of chaos, such a title could be perilous.

Shifting the topic, Fu Lingqing lamented, "If we had ferry boats like those of the Baoping Continent, relocating citizens to the high mountains for protection would be much easier."

Zuo shook his head. "Aside from the Da Li Song Clan, which is certain to swallow an entire continent, few dynasties would dare take on such massive debts to create ferry boats."

Such extraordinary vessels truly required the ability to reshape the land, their scale far surpassing that of typical intercontinental ferries. The Da Li Song Clan had achieved this thanks to steadfast support from both the Mo family and the main faction.

Fu Lingqing sighed, "Only after the waters recede can one see the rocks. Now we know that a sovereign's courage surpasses that of the immortal masters atop the mountains. It's a shame I'll never have the opportunity to visit the late Da Li Emperor."

A sense of personal gain and ambition could indeed lead one to perform great acts.

In the current turbulent world, the mountain practitioners of the Great Righteous World observed the foresight of the Baoping Continent's National Master, Cui Zhan, who collaborated with the Da Li Song Clan.

Zuo remained noncommittal.

Zuo had personal grievances with Cui Zhan from their shared past as disciples, yet he was not one to disregard Cui Zhan's actions for personal reasons. Otherwise, during their reunion at the Sword Qi Great Wall, things would have ended differently for Cui Dongshan.

Li Wanyong softly said, "It's a pity that the Wen Temple's accompanying saints have little actual combat power."

The Confucian sects divided into two factions, one in the light and one in the dark. The Seventy-Two Confucian Sanctums had their mountain masters at various levels: Nascent Soul, Jade Purity, and Immortal.

Moreover, many accompanying saints of the Wen Temple, who monitored the world, alongside others from the Wen Temple who wandered through time seeking or creating blessed lands to integrate into the Great Righteous World, such as the recently developed Fifth World. Additionally, there were those saints who followed the Li Saint to resist some extremely troublesome ancient deities, secretly protecting the entirety of the Great Righteous World from destruction. Unlike the headmasters of the academies, the fall of these accompanying saints often went unnoticed by the world and unrecorded, even the mountain practitioners remained unaware, let alone ordinary folks below.

The young sword cultivator, who was often regarded as the second coming of Fu Lingqing, had once been a brash youth, openly defying Zuo and nearly having his sword heart destroyed. Had it not been for the sect leader shielding him from a blow and Yuxin pleading on his behalf, it was doubtful that Li Wanyong would have found his place among the four prodigies of the Tongye Sect.

What Li Wanyong said was indeed true. The accompanying saints stationed across every continent in the Great Righteous World were tasked with monitoring the upper five realm practitioners, especially the peak masters at the Immortal and Ascendant levels. They confined themselves to their territories, overlooking the mortal world year after year. When Du Mao of the Tongye Sect ascended and traveled to the Baoping Continent, he required permission from the heavenly saints.

Similarly, the Fire Dragon Master from the Northern Ku Lu Continent faced the same necessity when venturing far. Countless Ascendants had their requests denied.

Thus, the old ancestor of Mount Tuo Yue humorously remarked that the peak cultivators of the Great Righteous World were far from free. This was no idle talk.

In the Great Righteous World, the constraints on powerful practitioners were profound, especially among the Confucians. The fates of the accompanying saints from the Wen Temple served as the greatest proof of this.

Unpleasant truths had long since settled within the Confucian sect themselves, leading the Ascendants to endure such conditions with a nose-holding resignation. Complaints were welcome, but after that, adherence to propriety was expected. This way, the peak masters would not have to descend to the mortal realm, where a mere sneeze or stomp could disrupt the landscape for miles.

Fu Lingqing's anger flared. "Li Wanyong! Mind your words!"

Li Wanyong turned pale.

It was rare for the gentle and refined sect leader to exhibit such fury.

Zuo said, "There's no need to put on a show for me."

Fu Lingqing nearly choked on his anger.

He genuinely respected the Confucian saints.

Moreover, these saints had returned to the mortal realm at the cost of their lives, bearing great significance as they safeguarded the unique customs of the continent, allowing practitioners to take advantage of favorable timing and location, significantly diminishing the onslaught of the savage demon forces. The large formations of the continent and the protective formations of various mountain peaks, such as the Tongye Sect's "Wutong Heavenly Umbrella," had become even more robust than during Zuo's time of questioning with a single sword.

Zuo stated, "What Li Wanyong said, though harsh, is a fact. Human strength is finite, and the saints are no exception. We are all the same."

The saint who had previously permitted Du Mao to leave the Tongye Sect had now fallen to the mortal realm, one of the many who had quietly faded away, with not much left of their former glory.

However, the complexities of the world often rendered discussions futile, as arguments emerged in the name of rationality yet devolved into disputes over merits and faults, leading to a scenario where both parties felt justified in their claims. If the discussion were simpler, it would merely be about the matter at hand, with both sides willing to acknowledge that no one, saint or otherwise, is without fault. Such reasoning would allow for mutual growth and a shared path toward enlightenment.

Li Wanyong was evidently taken aback and quite curious that this typically arrogant sword cultivator would speak well of him.

Zuo glanced at the young sword cultivator. "Among the four, you were the first to harbor thoughts of death, so you can speak freely. Just remember, speaking your mind is not the same as complaining, especially for a sword cultivator."

Li Wanyong found this hard to accept, feeling that Zuo was looking down on him and imposing moral weight. Did he really need outside opinions on how to wield his sword?

Yuxin, anxious, quickly reminded Li Wanyong, through their mental connection, that Zuo's words should be taken lightly.

Li Wanyong dares not openly confront Zuo, but Yuxin's calling him "Senior" only served to vex him further.

What "Senior"!

Just then, a sword cultivator flew in on his sword, returning from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Wang Shizi, a Golden Core-level practitioner, frequently sought guidance from Zuo on his swordsmanship and was poised to break through his bottleneck.

In the previous fourteen years, he had fought valiantly at the city walls, and though his accomplishments among Golden Core sword cultivators were average, for an outsider like him, it was quite an achievement. More importantly, Wang Shizi had always fought for his life, never sustaining any major injuries, leaving him without any hidden dangers in his cultivation. Zuo often remarked that he was tough enough to become a sword immortal one day.

Wang Shizi clasped his fists in greeting. "Senior Zuo, Sect Leader Fu."

He then nodded at Yuxin and Li Wanyong. 

The two prodigies of the Tongye Sect returned the gesture. They were quite impressed by Wang Shizi, who had previously been an inconspicuous figure on Tongye Continent. Despite being a sword cultivator, he had chosen to wander the mountains and rivers before the upside-down mountain, remaining anonymous and never aligning himself with any sect. After his ascension to the Golden Core realm at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he returned home, gradually gaining recognition for his emerging talent as a "sword immortal."

Wang Shizi, of similar age to Zuo, called him "Senior" with genuine respect. Perhaps due to Zuo's previous counsel, Wang Shizi was unaware of the happenings at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Wang Shizi succinctly reported a contentious issue between the Tongye Sect and the foreign practitioners, prompting Fu Lingqing to offer his suggestions. The Tongye Sect would take the initiative to yield, which Zuo agreed with.

After bidding farewell, Wang Shizi took off on his sword.

With the rain having ceased, Li Wanyong joined the sect leader to explore the arrangements for key mountain peak installations.

Zuo remained where he was, noticing that Yuxin had not left.

In the Great Righteous World, human hearts often drifted like waterfowl.

Seeing her linger, Zuo turned to ask, "Miss Yu, is there something on your mind?"

Gathering her courage, Yuxin asked, "Senior Zuo, among the nine great towns in the Great Righteous World, there's the Sword Town in South Posa Continent, said to be overseen by the sword immortal Cao Xi from the Li Pearl Cave. There’s also a Mountain Town in the Fuyao Continent. Why doesn’t our Tongye Continent have a Great Town?"

Zuo replied, "Actually, we do; it’s an extremely important demon-suppressing tower, the Ouhua Blessed Land's Observation Pavilion. There are only two blessed lands in the world that connect with each other, and your Tongye Continent's Ouhua Blessed Land is linked with the Dao Ancestor's Lotus Cave. However, the former overseer has ascended to the Qiming World to seek guidance from the Dao Ancestor, and since the Wen Temple hasn't obstructed anything, there must have been an agreement beforehand."

Yuxin curiously inquired, "Given its significance, why didn’t the Wen Temple discuss this with the old overseer to delay his ascension or at least leave the demon-suppressing tower in the Academy's care? Wouldn’t that give us a greater chance against the invading demon forces?"

The nine great towns of the Great Righteous World are the Mountain Town, National Town, Sea Town, Demon Town, Demon Suppression Town, Immortal Town, Sword Town, Dragon Town, and Bai Ze Town.

Zuo shook his head. "Many things we Confucians find too labor-intensive and thankless. For instance, we allow the myriad sects of the Great Righteous World to compete without exterminating the demon forces, while simultaneously granting secular dynasties the authority to enshrine river gods and mountain deities, not directly participating in the changes of the mortal dynasties. There has always been internal strife within the Wen Temple, be it between academies, or even within a single scholarly lineage, where disagreements often arise."

Zuo continued, "Discussing reason is the most exhausting endeavor. I have never excelled at such matters. As the Buddhists say, I am merely a self-sufficient person; even in learning the sword, I remain the same. In the lineage of the Sage of Literature, Ma Xiaodong was the most promising to inherit the teacher's legacy. However, bound by the limits of knowledge and cultivation talent, and the teacher's circumstances, Ma Xiaodong, who wished to stay in the lineage, found it increasingly difficult to act, requiring his personal journey to Middle Land’s Divine Continent to secure a title among the seventy-two academies. Fortunately, I now have a younger disciple who is more adept at reasoning with others, and I look forward to that."

Yuxin noticed that Zuo, usually taciturn, seemed to smile a bit when speaking of his younger disciple.

Zuo ceased speaking, likely issuing an implicit dismissal.

Yet Yuxin still had a question, "Senior Zuo, despite your negative impressions of our Tongye Sect, why do you still choose to stay here?"

Zuo answered, "Your sect leader, Fu Lingqing, is someone who values reason. As long as the most reasonable person on a mountain is willing to engage in dialogue, the local customs and practices can transition from the murky to the clear. Furthermore, I've been tasked by my own teacher and the great sword immortal to oversee the Tongye Continent, not just your Tongye Sect. Since my swordsmanship stems from this land, when the time comes to return it, it is only fitting."

Yuxin bowed respectfully and left.

She felt happy; although Senior Zuo still appeared cold, he had patiently discussed many matters with her today.

Previously, she had harbored resentment toward this sword immortal, who seemed far from scholarly, often bullying her with his bluntness, disregarding propriety and causing the sect to nearly fall apart, forcing the sect leader to break through to the Immortal realm... However, after Zuo returned from the Sword Qi Great Wall, according to Wang Shizi, he had "conveniently" eliminated a formidable demon hidden in the Luohua Island's Creation Cave and helped the Tongye Sect resist the invading forces from the savage world. This dissipated her grievances, and her previously pent-up emotions felt as if they had been washed away by the rain, refreshing like the budding of early spring, subtle yet promising.

Now, the entire Tongye Continent, due to the collaboration between the Tongye Sect, Jade Gui Sect, Taiping Mountain, and Fuqi Sect in constructing the Four Symbols Great Formation, along with the "Three Enclosures" celestial phenomena set up by the three heavenly saints before their descent to the mortal realm, including the Ascendant Xun Yuan, the old heavenly lord of Taiping Mountain, and the Immortal Jiang Shangzhen, each held dominion over one aspect. The old heavenly lord and Jiang Shangzhen had two accompanying saints from the Academy assisting them, like fortifying a cave, maintaining the flow of luck and energy across the continent. With both formations working in tandem, the three grand cultivators continued to consolidate the scattered energies from all directions, leading to bizarre weather phenomena on Tongye Continent. For instance, just after a sudden and massive downpour, signs of heavy snow began to emerge, catching everyone off guard.

Once the continent's great formations were fully stabilized, Taiping Mountain would enjoy spring all year round, the Jade Gui Sect would bask under a scorching sun, Fuqi Sect would feel autumn winds, and Tongye Sect would be blanketed in snow throughout the year.

Zuo returned to the thatched cottage to meditate and refine his sword.

At another location in the Tongye Sect, Qin Shuihu lay drunkenly beneath the flowers, waiting for the invading demon forces to arrive. Earlier, during the torrential rain, countless petals had fallen and covered him, yet he remained blissfully unaware.

Between the cessation of the rain and the impending snow, a celestial residence built on a cliff opened its windows to a full moon, overlooking a deep water pool, with steep cliffs and deep waters around it, making passage impossible. As Du Yan, a direct descendant of Du Mao, had endured numerous scorn and criticism over the years, he once regarded Jiang Shangzhen as his lifelong pursuit. Yet like a wayward son, he had squandered years of his life. In less than a decade, however, he had made remarkable progress, breaking through two realms successively. Now, he wore a troubled expression, then a determined one, contemplating the future of the Du family and vowing to rise in this decisive moment!

As heavy snow began to fall, Fu Lingqing, the purple-robed sword immortal, who had long been seen as a puppet sect leader in Tongye Continent, climbed alone to the summit of the ancestral hall, looking around and laughing heartily. "The heavy snow blankets the world, turning everything to white jade, clearing our hearts and minds, most suitable for drawing the sword."

At the northernmost ferry of Tongye Continent, a group of foreign immortals appeared somewhat helpless. They had just learned that two intercontinental ferries, including those of the Fu family from Old Dragon City, had already notified that the ferries would no longer operate between the two continents. Many of the ferry boats at the port were simply incapable of crossing the continent, and a few large vessels capable of reaching Old Dragon City had been requisitioned by the Academy for the south. Yunsign had earlier surrendered most of the celestial talisman boats and several precious resources to Taiping Mountain.

The immortal Yunsign wore a worried frown as she led her willing disciples from the Rain Dragon Sect to secretly land at the Fuqi Sect in Tongye Continent. They then headed straight for Taiping Mountain, delivering a confidential letter to the highly esteemed old heavenly lord and sect leader Song Mao. Before Yunsign could decide whether to stay at Taiping Mountain, the old heavenly lord proactively urged her to take the Rain Dragon disciples to the Baoping Continent. As for the gifts from Yunsign, the old heavenly lord was forthright, stating that Taiping Mountain would not be able to repay anything within a hundred years. And even after a hundred years, even if the Great Righteous World still existed, it would not matter much, advising Yunsign to prepare herself mentally.

Yunsign gazed out at the vast sea, sighed, and continued to ride the winds, leaving behind those disciples who had no choice but to board the humble talisman boats.

Shifting her gaze southwest, Yunsign reflected on the earlier ascension of the Upside-Down Mountain, which had attracted much attention. As an upper five realm practitioner, she had sensed a hint of its departure but was unsure of the state of the Water Crystal Palace atop the Upside-Down Mountain and what would become of the Rain Dragon Sect's ancestral hall.

Yunsign was reluctant to dwell on it, knowing that many would perish if it vanished. If it still existed, she was uncertain how the entire Great Righteous World would perceive the Rain Dragon Sect or how she and her fellow disciples would navigate their lives in a foreign land.

At the port, the crowd of celestial scholars and wild cultivators hustled about, all desperate to flee to Old Dragon City from Tongye Continent. 

In addition to cultivators, many influential dignitaries from various nations, who had generational ties with the mountains, filled the once-grand port, making it seem overly crowded.

A stunningly beautiful woman clad in a sword belt murmured to herself, "How am I different from them?"

As a practitioner of Tongye Continent, faced with calamity, escape was the only option.

A young man in Confucian robes, without any insignia from the Academy, shook his head. "Huang Ting, if you keep dwelling on this, I'll have to scold you. The old heavenly lord issued a decree personally, and Sect Leader Song sealed it with the hall’s seal, practically expelling you from the sect. Why? To allow you peace of mind to go to the Fifth World. Even in the worst-case scenario, you can leave a lineage behind at Taiping Mountain. Their intentions are good, not meant for your self-pity. If you continue to think this way, even if you reach the Fifth World, you won’t be able to break through the Golden Core bottleneck. Not only that, but it will also become your inner demon. I can tell you that there are already many formidable sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall over there; the odds of survival in a fight among sword cultivators are very slim. If you succumb to your inner demon there, you'll surely be hunted down by them."

Huang Ting replied, "If I lose to my inner demon and get killed by those sword cultivators, at least I die with dignity rather than being picked off by some despicable cultivators, earning them merit for slaying demons."

Zhong Kui, exasperated, said, "Huang Ting!"

Huang Ting retorted, "I’m just frustrated and venting a little. Why the rush? I may not care about my own life, but I would never joke about the sect."

Zhong Kui sighed in relief.

Huang Ting furrowed her brow. "How quickly people's hearts crumble."

Zhong Kui was even more worried, opting to share some good news to comfort himself. He whispered, "According to my teacher, things are much better over in the Fuqi Continent. They are used to fighting, and both the mountains and the mortals there cherish their lives far more than we do here in Tongye Continent. Under the Academy's leadership, several major dynasties have united as one, and most sects have followed suit. Especially a major northern dynasty, which has issued orders to ban all intercontinental ferries from leaving. Anyone daring to flee to the Golden Armored Continent or the Middle Land Divine Continent will be executed on sight."

Zhong Kui rubbed his face. "Look at us here. It's only human nature to fear death and cling to life, but if everyone feels that way, it becomes absurd. Officials no longer act like officials, and even immortals no longer care about their residences. They’ve abandoned ancestral halls, and as long as they can take the deity tablets and ancestor portraits with them, they believe they can flee..."

Zhong Kui hesitated to speak about something else.

Currently, a monumental task was underway in the Baoping Continent. For this, the Jade Gui Sect's leader Jiang Shangzhen, Taiping Mountain's old heavenly lord, and the sect leader of Fuqi Sect had all rushed to the sea between the two continents to meet with the National Master of the Da Li Kingdom, hoping to persuade the Baoping Continent to reconsider its stance and choose to cooperate with Tongye Continent. Even Ji Hai, the sect leader of Fuqi Sect, was willing to hand over the entire sect to the Da Li Dynasty, effectively becoming a vassal of the Da Li Song Clan!

Yet Cui Zhan still rejected Tongye Continent's proposal: first, to boil the sea with great fire to reveal the submerged mountain ridge between the two continents, and then to stabilize the path with water methods, thereby connecting Tongye and Baoping into one continent! 

After the war, they would flood the path again, severing the territories of the two continents.

Since the hidden tiger had already chosen the Northern Ku Lu Continent, Cui Zhan justified his stance by saying that while practitioners from Tongye Continent sought life in Baoping Continent, those from Northern Ku Lu Continent were willing to die in Baoping Continent. Thus, it was obvious which side Baoping Continent should choose; even a child in a school would understand this.

Zhong Kui had been present at that meeting and could only remain silent.

The meeting, which could potentially decide the fate of the three continents, ended without anyone in high spirits, nor did anyone direct harsh words at the Da Li National Master. Every participant knew the answer. It was impossible to force the issue. After all, Cui Zhan was someone who would dare to betray his own teachers and annihilate his clan, showing disdain even for the deputy head of the Wen Temple. As for exchanging some spirited words or threats with Cui Zhan, it was unnecessary; the great cultivators of Tongye Continent, including the old heavenly lord and Ji Hai, still had a measure of composure.

As for Cui Zhan, apart from stating his reasoning, he offered no sarcastic remarks about the Tongye Continent’s customs.

At the time, someone had asked Cui Zhan whether the Tongye Continent could circumvent the rules to merge the two continents. He had said that it was situational; if the sword cultivators of Northern Ku Lu Continent agreed to this, then it would be considered the agreement of the practitioners of the continent, and the Wen Temple would have no choice but to comply. Even if they refused, what could the Wen Temple do?

Zhong Kui admired this once infamous disciple of the Sage of Literature.

When Cui Zhan spoke of the grand trends of the world, everyone listened obediently, regardless of their identity.

Zhong Kui glanced at the group of Rain Dragon Sect practitioners in the distance and remarked, "If everyone in the Rain Dragon Sect were like this, that would be great."

Huang Ting shook her head. "When the top is crooked, the bottom will be too. A chaotic Rain Dragon Sect is surprising enough, and the presence of that elder Yunsign is already a stroke of luck."

Ultimately, Yunsign led the group of Rain Dragon Sect disciples to Old Dragon City, self-identifying at the vassal prince's mansion and offering to contribute their meager strength to the excavation of the river source in the central Baoping Continent. Prince Song Mu personally received them. Before he even reached the main hall, he urgently ordered a Da Li military ferry to be repurposed to transport Yunsign and several other practitioners to central Baoping Continent. Within less than half a stick of incense after Yunsign settled in the prince's mansion for tea, they were already set to depart.

Song Mu personally escorted the Rain Dragon Sect group to the military ferry in the inner city, finally bowing in gratitude to all, including Yunsign, stating that from that day forward, all Rain Dragon Sect practitioners would have unrestricted access to the mansion.

Aside from that, the young prince did not exchange a single polite word throughout.

When the ferry reached the source of the river, the welcoming party consisted of one of the three chief supervisors of the Great River, Liu Qingfeng, who handed the Rain Dragon Sect practitioners a document outlining the excavation progress and sought Yunsign's advice on the water methods, both parties meticulously revising and improving the plan hastily drafted by the supervisory office for the night. If Song Mu gave off a feeling of decisiveness, then Liu Qingfeng felt like a gentle breeze.

Yunsign found it deeply moving.

Even while the Tongye Continent was in a state of chaos, everything in Baoping Continent seemed to run smoothly, orderly, and without stagnation.

In a small town in the Huaihuang County of the Da Li Kingdom, a new shopkeeper named Chang Ming had just emerged. 

Shan Jun Wei Bo had just returned from a night banquet with the sword immortal Mi Yu. Confirming her identity beyond doubt, Wei Bo didn’t immediately lift the restrictions of the lotus flower blessed land but said that they would need to wait for the final decision from the steward Zhu Lian of the Fallen-Into-Disrepair Mountain. Thus, Chang Ming temporarily helped out at the age-old shop.

She took out a copper coin of her life essence and was somewhat surprised to see the golden light swirling around it, shining brightly. It felt as if her life essence resonated with the world around her.

Indeed, choosing this place to cultivate was an excellent choice.

Chang Ming looked forward even more to the prospects of the medium-grade Ouhua Blessed Land.

At the Fallen-Into-Disrepair Mountain, Wei Bo and Mi Yu sat at a stone table. The Northern Yue Mountain Lord appeared somewhat helpless. Given their relationship, Chang Ming’s entry into the mountain would not have to wait for Zhu Lian’s word; however, Wei Bo found that he could not act on this matter. The Tongye Umbrella had already been passed on to Cui Dongshan according to the instructions in the confidential letter, and it should eventually end up in the hands of a practitioner from Tongye Continent, be it Taiping Mountain, Zhong Kui, or even that steward "Zhou Fei" from Fallen-Into-Disrepair Mountain, to accommodate those seeking refuge.

The only uncertainty was whether the newly promoted medium-grade Ouhua Blessed Land would revert to its original state upon returning to Fallen-Into-Disrepair Mountain, once again becoming a low-grade land with thin spiritual energy. After all, once refugees returned home, they would take the spiritual energy with them; the more people there were, the more luck and spiritual energy would be siphoned away, ultimately diminishing the Ouhua Blessed Land further.

Wei Bo gazed into the distance, recalling the malicious intent behind the travelogue, murmuring, "Chen Ping'an, is it really worth it?"

Mi Yu smiled. "Mountain Lord Wei, it seems you still don’t understand our Mountain Master, or rather, the Hidden Official from the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Turning to the side, he asked the little girl in black who was quietly munching on seeds, "Little Mi Li, what does the couplet for the shop selling the mute lake wine say?"

Zhou Mi Li quickly set down her seeds, picked up the small golden shoulder pole from the table, stood up, and recited, "The sword immortal's three-foot sword, gazing at the vastness with confusion; where is the enemy, the heroes in solitude!"

She cleared her throat and shouted even louder, "Two draughts in the cup, sharing ancient sorrows with you; only in drunkenness, what does money matter?"

The little girl raised her hand high, showing off her golden shoulder pole, as if to say, "Look, I have the golden shoulder pole; what does money matter?"

Mi Yu took a hearty swig of wine, reminiscing about the time when a snowstorm hit the Summer Palace and the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage built snowmen together, recalling a moment when the young Hidden Official jokingly said, "I refuse to believe that the world can be so dire!"

Mi Yu believed that even today, standing here, the young Hidden Official would still think the same way and remain unwavering in his belief. 

Some realizations have little to do with the state of the world.

Meanwhile, at the Yang family shop, the assistant named Yang Shu rarely wore a smile, as he recognized the girl entering today—Li Liu, the daughter of Li Er and the elder sister of that little brat Li Huai. Yang Shu had once harbored hopes regarding her, but his family had disapproved, saying it wasn't about money. When he pressed further, they merely told him it was the old patriarch's wishes, and he should give up on such thoughts.

Yet the usually solitary Li Liu had a plump woman dressed in coarse fabric by her side today, which was somewhat distracting. Yang Shu couldn’t help but glance at her a few times. How could a woman become so large? What must she eat? The woman flashed him a shy smile, startling Yang Shu. As the woman lifted the curtain and stood aside, Li Liu stepped into the courtyard, and only then did the woman lower the curtain, giving Yang Shu another smile. He watched the woman, resembling a small mountain behind the counter, and secretly raised his arm, feeling like he, a grown man, might not even be her match.

Li Liu settled into a bamboo chair that creaked as soon as she sat down, crafted by her brother Li Huai.

The woman, carrying the entire Luoshui Pit with her, stood behind Li Liu, not daring to breathe too loudly, knowing full well the identity of the old man sitting on the steps, who had once overseen one of the two Ascension Platforms in ancient times.

A woman in blue descended on a sword in the courtyard, taking a seat on the long bench in the corridor.

Old Yang lightly tapped his pipe against the steps and said, "This is how it is. If you succeed, only by holding onto the Baoping Continent can it be counted as a merit. If you fail, it will be a disaster. In the past, I had always restrained you two, but after this, you can do as you please."

Upon seeing the blue-robed woman, the plump woman was greatly shocked and horrified, a visceral instinct overcoming her.

She wasn't foolish; after all, she was a well-informed Ascendant-level demon, and upon realizing Li Liu's true identity, she quickly deduced the identity of the unfamiliar woman.

The highest deities, seated on their thrones, looked down upon the mortal world, as the sun boiled the sea and annihilated all! Wherever the sunlight reached, it was territory.

The woman initially grew increasingly apprehensive, and as changes began to manifest in her face and eyes, her fierce nature erupted. A powerful Ascendant demon could not simply await death; even in fear, she was determined to unleash a fight!

Ruan Xiu slowly withdrew her gaze from the woman, pulling out an embroidered handkerchief while nibbling on a pastry, savoring it slowly.

Li Liu remarked, "I’m fine; the key is her."

Ruan Xiu nodded, "I have only one request: regardless of the outcome, the merits of the Wen Temple should be credited to the Longquan Sword Sect, and can be halved."

Old Yang hesitated for a moment. "I’ll discuss this with Cui Zhan; if they’re taking the initiative to halve it, it shouldn’t be a big issue."

Li Liu added, "Then I also want it credited to Li Huai."

Old Yang replied grumpily, "What’s the point of doing that? Does that little brat even need it? He’ll only complain that the dog feces shoes are too heavy."

Li Liu chuckled, but soon dismissed the thought. 

However, she tossed the red thread she had borrowed from Li Huai to Old Yang and coldly remarked, "What do you think? Aiming for my younger brother, are you tired of living? How about I use that merit to exchange for the life of that stinky woman; is that enough?"

Old Yang frowned. "Don’t concern yourself with this; I’ll clean up the mess."

Ruan Xiu suddenly asked, "What’s the deal with that travelogue?"

Old Yang scoffed, "Writers divide into two schools: one aims for historical accuracy, striving to separate themselves from the minor historians, unwilling to play a minor role in the narrative. They hope to achieve the path through a pure paper blessed land, while the other school seeks to shortcut through historical fiction, aiming for something grand."

He waved his pipe dismissively. "You all need not concern yourselves with these matters. Your priority should be to break through to the Jade Purity level as soon as possible; you no longer need to hide too much."

Ruan Xiu glanced over at the plump woman, her pastry finished.

Once she was killed, there was a chance she could ascend to the Immortal realm herself.

Li Liu coldly admonished, "Ruan Xiu, tone it down."

Ruan Xiu lazily sat on the long bench, squinting and grinning. "Who do you think you are?"

The woman felt a wave of anxiety.

This was the true essence of a celestial battle.

Ruan Xiu asked, "Can he still come back?"

Old Yang remained silent, though the smoke in the small courtyard thickened.

The woman was once more taken aback and shaken, turning to look at a tall woman in white behind Old Yang, with golden eyes.

Upon seeing "her," the Luoshui Pit woman felt a twinge of exhaustion, realizing she shouldn't have followed Li Liu here; it seemed that even she, an Ascendant, was outmatched here. She thought she would have been better off facing the Fire Dragon Master in the Northern Ku Lu Continent.

The tall woman smiled and said, "Of course."

Her gaze lowered slightly as she looked down at Old Yang, "Tell Cui Zhan to let the Wen Temple know to be careful; I might just unite the Great Righteous World and the Qiming World into one."

Old Yang replied, "As long as you stay here, Chen Ping'an will have a chance; he is resilient. Moreover, his forbearance is justified. If you were to follow him there, he might lose his life at the Sword Qi Great Wall."

She responded, "Is lingering there worse than death?"

Old Yang remarked, "I actually think staying there is the best form of cultivation. Climbing the mountain is significant; refining the heart is challenging. It's not merely about being scolded or doing good deeds; that doesn't equate to cultivation."

She coldly laughed, "It seems you and Chen Qing are quite qualified to say such things."

Old Yang nodded. "It's a compromise."

He waved the pipe again, cautioning, "Be careful; those major demon overlords won’t allow you to boil the sea and move water with impunity."

Ruan Xiu left the courtyard on her sword, while Li Liu took the woman back to the ancestral home.

Old Yang rose, "If anything happens to me, please take care of a few matters."

She nodded, "There are few old friends left. You need to take care of yourself."

Old Yang smiled and repeated the earlier words, "A compromise."

At the mid-section of the Great River in Baoping Continent, a white-clad youth rode on a child’s back, accompanied by a gray-haired old Confucian scholar and Lin Shouyi, who followed silently.

The youth was cursing the old bastard endlessly.

Lin Shouyi feigned ignorance, though both could be considered his respected seniors.

The National Master asked Lin Shouyi, "What do you think of Liu Qingfeng?"

Lin Shouyi replied, "He is naturally suited for studying your teachings. He is a good person, and his knowledge never falls short."

Cui Zhan remarked, "He can analyze situations well but is limited in understanding people. Liu Qingfeng is someone who maintains a cold gaze while being warm-hearted; don’t be deceived by his kindness—it's the coldness that’s crucial."

Cui Dongshan chuckled. "The old bastard can still speak a few human words, how rare! Liu Qingfeng’s good nature is commendable, but it doesn’t mean he respects this world. In truth, Liu Qingfeng doesn’t care about how the world views him. The reason I admire him is that he is like me; the sequence of events must not be mistaken."

Cui Zhan stated, "I’m about to head to the Ghostly Cave at the Bone Marsh in Northern Ku Lu Continent."

Cui Dongshan hesitated. "Why not let me go? I have my brother Gao to guide me."

Cui Zhan replied, "Your realm is too low; that Gao may not listen to you. Baoping Continent has no time to waste on power struggles with him. If he wants to complete the Great Dao and learn the fundamental methods of reincarnation, Baoping Continent will give him that opportunity. In critical moments, I’ll borrow Zhong Kui from Tongye Continent. You should first find that wandering monk who has arrived at the Baiyun Temple. Some matters need to be arranged in advance; otherwise, the taboos are too great, leading to losses. I absolutely will not allow Baoping Continent to remain a mere patchwork of failures, even if it holds on."

Had Tongye Continent not been so fractured in spirit, Cui Zhan might have considered linking Baoping and Tongye together.

Adding Zhong Kui and Gao, and even Cui Dongshan, there was great potential.

Cui Dongshan pressed down on the child’s head, cursing, "Gao, that shameless old bastard is trying to con you; hurry up and spit in his face, help him wash it off..."

Cui Zhan emphasized, "I’m speaking of serious business!"

Cui Dongshan retorted, "I’m not deaf!"

Before departing, Cui Zhan seemed to mutter some meaningless words, "From now on, cultivate diligently. If you see the old scholar, tell him that all matters of right and wrong, merit and demerit, lie within my heart. There’s nothing more to discuss with him."

Cui Dongshan grumbled, "You can say that yourself. I’m not a messenger. It’s a bit much to call the old scholar 'ancestor'—it feels embarrassing."

Cui Zhan looked up at the sky, indifferently saying, "I let you speak because I lack the ability to do so."

The Da Li National Master, with the ability to traverse mountains and rivers, swiftly vanished hundreds of miles away, making the vast Baoping Continent seem like a small realm belonging to this Ascendant scholar.

Cui Dongshan leaped off the child, springing up and swinging his sleeves, punching toward the direction where Cui Zhan had disappeared, cursing loudly.

Lin Shouyi understood that this seemingly frivolous young elder, Cui Dongshan, was actually quite sentimental.

At the time Cui Zhan left Baoping Continent for Northern Ku Lu Continent, many grand cultivators had already joined forces to employ a tremendous supernatural power to isolate the world.

At the northernmost part of Baoping Continent, Ruan Xiu shook the bracelet on her wrist, and a fire dragon suddenly appeared, racing northward. Under the sunlight, numerous rays of light seemed to converge along that path.

At the southern tip of Northern Ku Lu Continent, Li Liu stood on the shore, parting the sea.

On one side, many sword immortals and upper five realm practitioners from Northern Ku Lu Continent formed a protective formation, including Qi Jinglong, the sect leader of the Taihui Sword Sect, and the Old Ancestor Huang Tong of the Cheng Law Sect, as well as Li Cai, who had just returned from traveling in Southern Posa Continent, and Bai Chang, the foremost sword cultivator of the North.

On the left side stood only two Ascendants, old acquaintances: the Fire Dragon Real Man and the Luoshui Pit woman, both seeming cheerful.

Lu Zhi, the blushing lady, and the sword immortal Shao Yunyan had also reached Southern Posa Continent.

The bearded rogue of the savage world arrived at the southern shore of Southern Posa Continent, seeking the sword of the refined Chen Chunan.

Half of the practitioners from Southern Posa could see that streak of sword light slicing through the night.

A bright moon appeared high above the sea, perfectly enveloping the entirety of Posa Continent. The fierce sword light pierced through the moon's barrier, and was captured by Chen Chunan's towering law projection.

Atop a mountain peak by the sea, the blushing lady softly asked, "Why did Liu Cha act this way? Isn’t he just temporarily relieving Chen Chunan's crisis?"

Shao Yunyan replied, "It’s precisely because he respects Chen Chunan that Liu Cha rushed over to present this sword. Of course, it’s not solely that; after this sword strike, the Middle Land Divine Continent will focus more on defending Southern Posa Continent. A significant number of practitioners from the Middle Land, including the old ancestor Huai Jia, are already on their way to Southern Posa."

The blushing lady scoffed, "Are they here to watch a show? Why not learn from Zhou Zhenzhi and guard the mountain water caves in Fuqi Sect instead?"

Shao Yunyan fell silent.

The tall, thin female sword immortal suddenly opened her eyes and nodded slightly. It turned out that Chen Chunan had retracted his law projection, appearing among them.

The once sarcastic blushing lady fell silent. She had never thought highly of the Great Righteous World, especially after following Lu Zhi, and began to identify herself as half a person from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Yet the presence of this cultured person truly instilled awe in her.

In the end, there were still some learned individuals in the Great Righteous World, as if they embodied reason wherever they went. 

Provoking them was even more daunting than inciting the wild Ascendants.

Chen Chunan smiled and greeted everyone before gazing at the sea, where the sun and moon rested on his shoulders, yet the bright moon bore a crack.

Chen Chunan and Lu Zhi exchanged knowing smiles.

The Great Righteous World had nine formidable streams of martial energy, surging into the savage world and the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

The savage world was no different; a tremendous wave of martial energy surged toward the Sword Qi Great Wall.

At the cliff of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Dragon Lord chuckled. "Mad dog."

A certain mentally unstable qi practitioner, who had never intended to break through to the Golden Core Sword Cultivator level, had deliberately shattered his alchemy multiple times, repeatedly breaking his soul and using the Sword Qi Great Wall to merge his path, thereby reshaping his body and restoring his soul. In this unprecedented manner, he forged his martial physique, achieving the pinnacle of a pure martial artist.

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 814: Fragments of Peace

In a forbidden area of Central Earth, within a hundred-mile radius, the mountains were clear, the waters serene, and the scenery picturesque. Yet, there stood a two-story building with three wide eaves, looking as if it had been plucked from a nobleman's estate, standing alone like a small study.

The plaque above the entrance was not large, but it bore significant meaning: "Tranquil Bai Ze."

Inside the main hall, there hung a portrait of the Great Sage. If it weren't for the plaque revealing the heavenly secrets, any cultivator who accidentally wandered into this place would think its owner was a reclusive Confucian disciple.

A middle-aged man with a dignified face was perusing a book. Every year, gentlemen scholars from the Rites Academy would send books to this place, covering a wide range of topics—from the teachings of sages and literary notes to strange tales. The academy would regularly place them on a small hill at the edge of the forbidden ground. This unremarkable hill had only a broken stone tablet resembling a turtle, with faint inscriptions that read, "In the first month of spring, heavy rains began, marking the start of the scriptures." The scholars simply needed to place the books on the stone tablet, and a woman would later come to collect them, delivering them to her master, the great demon Bai Ze.

After setting the book down, Bai Ze gazed out at the palace-clad woman by the door and asked, “Are you worried that the situation in Tongye Continent will endanger Lady Huansha, who has severed her own tail?”

Upon hearing the question, the woman immediately turned around, respectfully replying, “In response to your inquiry, my lord, witnessing the unfortunate fate of the Rain Dragon Sect, I indeed worry for Lady Huansha’s safety.”

Lady Huansha was not only one of the four esteemed ladies of the Haoran Realm, alongside the lady of Qing Shen Mountain, the rosy lady of Plum Blossom Garden, and the lady of the Moon Palace planting osmanthus, but she was also one of the two celestial foxes of the Haoran Realm, the Nine-Tailed Fox. The other, the ancestral fox of this palace-clad woman, had, due to her destined misfortune, sought the protection of the great celestial master of Longhu Mountain during a catastrophic heavenly tribulation. With deep ties to the celestial path, she not only survived the Five Thunder Tribulation but also successfully broke through to a higher realm. In gratitude, she had served as the guardian and offering at the Celestial Master’s estate for thousands of years, at the ascended level.

The palace woman wore a somewhat melancholic expression, resenting Lady Huansha for forsaking her celestial fox status and choosing to remain uninvolved, offering no assistance. Had it been her, she would never have made such a foolish decision.

Bai Ze approached the door, and the palace woman cautiously stepped back, maintaining a respectful distance. After a thousand years of close companionship, she dared not overstep her bounds.

Bai Ze asked, “Qing Ying, where do you think the odds lie for the Wildlands?”

The fox enchantress named Qing Ying replied, “The demon army of the Wildlands concentrates its strength and focus solely on seizing territory, driven by profit. Their intentions are pure and straightforward. Even now, divided into three forces, they still hold an absolute advantage over Nan Posa Continent, Fu Yao Continent, and Tongye Continent. Moreover, the signs of internal strife within the Haoran Realm present a significant hidden danger. The pinnacle cultivators of the Haoran Realm, whether in the Immortal or Ascended realms, are indeed too constrained. If that great ancestor from Tuo Yue Mountain genuinely honors his promises, once the world changes, any strong cultivators, regardless of their origins, will gain a semblance of freedom, which is highly tempting.”

As she spoke, Qing Ying felt a pang of anxiety. Years ago, she had carelessly leaked her thoughts during a snowstorm on a small island and was punished by her master, who, in his anger, had cast her into a ravine, causing her to call out her true name, resulting in her losing a tail.

Bai Ze stated, “Speak plainly.”

With permission granted, Qing Ying continued, “Tongye Continent has historically been insular and accustomed to comfort. Sudden calamity strikes, and everyone is caught off guard, making it difficult to unite people’s hearts. Once the academy cannot restrain the fleeing cultivators with an iron fist, and the celestial beings on the mountain rally the dynasties below, the situation will deteriorate instantly. If demons invade the heart of Tongye Continent, it will be akin to elite cavalry hunting down refugees; the demon losses on the mountains could very well be negligible. In the end, Tongye Continent may be reduced to merely seven or eight sects barely holding on. The northern route is too small for Baoping Continent, and the sword cultivators of North Julu Continent have suffered severe losses at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Besides, though the people there are fierce, they tend to fight amongst themselves. Such a war is not a battle between the cultivators on the mountain; the outcome for North Julu Continent will be tragic, with brave souls falling without reason. The merchants of Aiai Continent, known for their greed, upon witnessing the fate of the sword cultivators from North Julu Continent, will be terrified and weigh the pros and cons. Thus, this war encompassing the four continents is likely to fail in succession. Additionally, with the distant support from Fu Yao Continent, Jin Jia Continent, and Liu Xia Continent, it’s very likely that half of the Haoran Realm will ultimately fall into the hands of the demons. Once the momentum shifts, even if Central Earth’s foundation is profound—able to rival the eight continents—how can it resist? It will just wait to be exploited, gradually devoured by the demons like catching a turtle in a jar.”

Bai Ze chuckled, “That’s merely talking strategy on paper.”

Qing Ying did not dare to question her master.

Bai Ze descended the steps and began to stroll, with Qing Ying following closely behind. He slowly remarked, “You are merely talking strategy on paper. The gentlemen of the academy may not be so naïve. Knowledge in the world leads to varied paths, and waging war is, in essence, akin to academic pursuits. What is gained from paper is ultimately shallow; true understanding comes from practice. The old scholar insisted that the gentlemen of the academy minimize their involvement in worldly affairs, avoiding the role of a shadowy figure behind the throne, yet he invited military strategists and philosophers to explain the pros and cons of each war in detail, even making military studies a required subject for promotion within the academy. This caused quite a stir in the Confucian temple and was seen as neglecting the fundamental principles of governance in favor of external paths—a grave mistake. It was only after the Sub-Sage personally nodded and stated, ‘National affairs encompass rites and warfare,’ that it was permitted to be implemented.”

Qing Ying understood these inner workings of the Confucian temple but was not particularly concerned. What did it matter? She and her master were required to obtain approval from two deputy headmasters and three grand priests to step outside, and if any one of them shook their head, it was a no-go. Thus, during that cross-continent journey, she had indeed harbored a bellyful of anger.

Bai Ze walked slowly, “The old scholar held the view that human nature is fundamentally evil, yet insisted on emphasizing the phrase ‘Filial piety is the greatest virtue,’ placing it above loyalty, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Isn’t that a bit contradictory, perplexing?”

Qing Ying felt somewhat helpless. She had no interest in the studies of Confucian sages. She could only say, “I truly do not understand the deeper meanings of the Sage.”

Bai Ze answered himself, “The reasoning is quite simple. Filial piety is closest to people, managing peace in the family and the nation, and in every household, they engage daily with the concept of filial piety. It’s the first step in human cultivation. When the door is closed, other virtues inevitably drift away. Truly filial individuals rarely become great evildoers; any exceptions are, after all, exceptions. The threshold for filial piety is low; one doesn’t need to study extensively to serve rulers and alleviate their worries. It doesn’t require profound understanding of the world or grand ambitions. If one excels at this virtue…”

Bai Ze turned, pointing at the imposing Zheng Bai Ze building without raising his eyes, “The household becomes stable; familial ties strengthen. When one steps outside, reading more and pondering more naturally leads to loyalty, righteousness, and propriety. I would say, the day comes when the world within the door grows distant, and spouses separate without burdens, while outside the door, everyone acts for themselves—there are fewer fools and more clever individuals—that world is truly in decline. Because the subtle aspects of this world are increasingly losing their cohesiveness. This is also why the old scholar was reluctant to promote his first disciple, Cui Zhan, too early in ‘Meritorious Achievements,’ not because the knowledge of that embroidered tiger was lacking, but because a single misstep could lead to great flaws. By then, even the Great Sage and the Rites Saint personally intervening would struggle to remedy it. If fathers and sons, husbands and wives are always calculating benefits and losses, they would enter the end times of human hearts faster than the schools of Buddhism and Daoism.”

Bai Ze smiled, “Those on the mountain and below, the high-ranking individuals are not too afraid of unfilial descendants, yet they are extremely worried about their unworthy heirs. That’s quite interesting.”

Suddenly, Bai Ze laughed, “I’ve gone out of my way to say so many good things about you, and you can’t even be grateful for once?”

Qing Ying was taken aback, unsure why her master would say such a thing.

Bai Ze sighed, “It’s returning home late. I dread to think of what might happen.”

Bai Ze led Qing Ying back to the “study.” 

Upon entering, Qing Ying saw an old scholar in a Confucian robe, who had his back to them, tiptoeing with a scroll in his hand, gesturing at a spot on the wall, seemingly about to hang it up. On the table beneath the portrait of the Great Sage, several books had already been placed. Qing Ying was bewildered and even angrier. Was anyone allowed to intrude upon her master’s tranquil cultivation space?! However, what troubled her most was that someone capable of entering this place quietly, especially a scholar, was not someone she could provoke, and her master had a gentle temperament, never permitting her to act with any display of power.

Standing at the threshold, Bai Ze coldly remarked, “Old Scholar, it would be wise to know when to stop. I can tolerate a few forbidden books, but hanging up your portrait is too much.”

Upon hearing the term “Old Scholar,” Qing Ying immediately focused her mind, her earlier anger evaporating in an instant.

Years ago, when she had asked her master why the Great Sage’s portrait hung in Zheng Bai Ze, she had been curious. After all, even the Rites Saint, who established the etiquette for the world, treated her master with respect, referring to him as “Sir,” while her master merely called him “Young Master.” Yet Bai Ze had never shown any favor to the deputy headmasters of the Confucian temple or the grand priests of the academy, even when the Sub-Sage visited; he stopped at the threshold.

In reality, the so-called “Tranquil Bai Ze” was entirely different from the other eight imposing structures that suppressed the flow of qi; it was merely for show. The plaque of “Tranquil Bai Ze” didn’t even need to be hung—it was handwritten by her master himself. The reason he had given was simply to deter those scholars from entering, making it so that even if they dared to bother Bai Ze, they would have no face to sit inside.

There was, however, a single exception.

The Old Scholar.

At that time, Qing Ying had missed the once-prominent Great Sage while on her way to collect books.

She later heard from a little spirit that resided in the rafters of the house that the Old Scholar had not only entered eagerly, but had also scolded her master for being too inconsiderate, saying that in someone else’s abode, he should at least show some respect—hanging up the portrait would save him a lot of unnecessary trouble. So, the Old Scholar had taken the liberty of hanging the portrait himself. Fortunately, her master hadn’t taken it down and tossed it out; it had remained there ever since.

The Old Scholar, who had been expelled from the realm of the living by Bai Ze, turned around with a huff and shook the scroll in his hand, “I’m just afraid that the old man would be lonely hanging on the wall, looking all solitary. Hanging up the Rites Saint’s portrait along with mine, he might not even be happy. Others may not know, but you, Bai, should be well aware that the old man and I get along quite well…”

Bai Ze smiled, “Have some dignity.”

The Old Scholar, filled with indignation, stomped his foot and exclaimed, “With so many scholars unable to even read their books, their lives at stake—what use is dignity?! Do you, Bai Ze, even care about the sages and scholars in this room?! Huh?!”

Qing Ying jumped in surprise.

Bai Ze frowned, “This is the last warning. We can reminisce, but I will not tolerate you lecturing me on principles and righteousness. The bond of incense between you and me is too fragile for such grand posturing.”

The Old Scholar quickly changed his demeanor, slightly lifting himself off the chair to show his apology and sincerity, not forgetting to wipe the spot where he had slapped the table with his sleeve. He laughed heartily, “I was just talking to you with the tone of the old third and the two deputy headmasters. No need to worry! I won’t talk about the world’s literary pulse or the grand ambitions of the ages, just reminiscing. Qing Ying, could you find us a chair or stool? Otherwise, I feel uncomfortable talking while sitting.”

Bai Ze waved his hand, signaling Qing Ying to leave the room.

Qing Ying, however, dared not let her emotions show on her face; she properly bowed to the Old Scholar before making her exit.

The Old Scholar, smiling, watched the young woman leave, then casually opened a book, softly sighing, “Although my heart is for the rites, it doesn’t mean I disregard them. Yet, I still act according to the rules; the Rites Saint is the greatest of them all.”

Bai Ze replied, “Patience is limited; cherish it well.”

The Old Scholar flipped through the pages persistently, placing one book down and picking up another. Stretching out his neck, he glanced at Bai Ze’s annotations in the margin and nodded, “The study of annotations, interpretations, and the sounds and meanings of words, is just a transmission that can be divided into various categories—big and small, internal and external, and so on. There is so much knowledge to gain, and life is too short, making it easy for future scholars to feel lost in the clouds. Especially when the number of books increases, one can only enter the gold and silver mountains by exploring deeply. Any small gain becomes cherished, but once they return home with countless treasures, they gradually abandon them as if they were worthless. Furthermore, the teachings of sages and saints only urge people to give up benefits, teaching them how to establish their lives but failing to teach them how to secure their existence. It’s hard to truly harmonize, ultimately leading to discontent.”

Bai Ze sighed, “You’re set on not leaving, aren’t you?”

The Old Scholar set down the book, gently stacking the pile of books neatly, and said seriously, “In chaotic times, heroes emerge.”

Bai Ze’s expression darkened slightly.

The Old Scholar chuckled, “Scholars often face difficult situations and even have to do things against their conscience. I sincerely ask you, Bai, to be more forgiving.”

Bai Ze replied, “I have been quite accommodating already.”

The Old Scholar asked, “Then can you give us scholars a chance to correct our mistakes?”

Bai Ze said, “Last word.”

The Old Scholar stood up, circled around the table, and bowed to Bai Ze without saying a word, then left.

Bai Ze sighed.

Moments later, someone peeked in at the door.

Bai Ze held his forehead in silence, took a deep breath, and approached the door.

The Old Scholar was sitting on the threshold.

Bai Ze said, “Speak, what is it? Whether I do it or not is up to you.”

The Old Scholar finally said, “Help Chen Chunan from the Sub-Sage lineage, don’t make it so difficult for him.”

If Chen Chunan truly cared about being a pure Confucian, he wouldn’t be Chen Chunan. His real dilemma lay in his origin from the Sub-Sage lineage; at that time, public opinion would not only target Chen Chunan himself but the entire Sub-Sage lineage.

Regarding the matter of going to Nan Posa Continent, Bai Ze neither rejected nor agreed.

Bai Ze questioned, “Isn’t it about helping that Cui Zhan who is holding the line, or your disciple trapped at the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

The Old Scholar stood up and replied, “The lineage of the Great Sage never seeks help! All my knowledge is meant to do something for this world.”

Bai Ze nodded.

The Old Scholar suddenly wiped his face, sorrowfully saying, “Seeking help is useless. As a teacher, how could I not seek?”

Bai Ze felt a mix of amusement and helplessness, remaining silent for a long while before finally shaking his head, “Old Scholar, I won’t leave this place and disappoint you.”

The Old Scholar shook his head, “You speak too highly of yourself. While I did come with a glimmer of hope, if things don’t work out, there’s no need for disappointment. After all, we scholars…”

Bai Ze interrupted, “What next?”

The Old Scholar suddenly exploded in anger, fuming, “Damn it, let’s go to Bai Zhi Fudi and curse! Let’s catch the highest-ranked and scold them. If they dare reply, I’ll secretly make a paper figure as tall as a person and place it in the Confucian temple!”

Bai Ze reached out and grabbed a “Mountain Search Map” from the beams of the room, tossing it to the Old Scholar.

The Old Scholar quickly tucked it into his sleeve and patted Bai Ze’s sleeve, “A true hero, a true hero!”

Bai Ze shook his sleeve, “This was stolen from me when I traveled.”

The Old Scholar nodded vigorously, “So much nonsense, do you think I don’t understand this bit of etiquette? I’m not a fool; I won’t make things difficult for you, Bai!”

Bai Ze’s expression remained indifferent, “Don’t forget, I’m not human.”

The Old Scholar stomped his foot, “I don’t like hearing that. Don’t worry, I’ll scold them on your behalf at the Rites Saint’s place. What Rites Saint? What great knowledge and rules? I’ll scold them just the same. Back when I was forcefully taken into the Confucian temple to eat cold pork head meat, I was the most respectful toward the statue of the Rites Saint. Other predecessors who offered incense to the sages were just common offerings, but for the old man and the Rites Saint, I tightened my teeth and spent a lot of money to buy incense from the mountains…”

The Old Scholar suddenly halted his speech, vanished in an instant, leaving behind only a reminder not to forget the portrait.

A clean-faced middle-aged man appeared outside the house, bowing to Bai Ze, who returned the gesture for the first time.

Crossing the threshold together, the middle-aged man gently opened the scroll, only to burst into laughter upon realizing it was not the Old Scholar’s portrait but his own.

So it was actually a portrait of the Rites Saint.

Bai Ze rubbed his forehead, helplessly saying, “Isn’t it bothersome?”

The Rites Saint smiled, “I’m fine, but our Great Sage finds him most bothersome.”

When the old scholar’s statue was moved out of the Confucian temple, it was still bearable; the Old Scholar didn’t mind much. However, when scholars across the land smashed his statue, the Great Sage watched alongside the Old Scholar, who didn’t express any grievance but merely said that scholars value their dignity highly. This humiliation was intolerable, after which he wondered whether the Confucian temple would treat the Old Scholar’s lineage with a bit more leniency. As for Cui Zhan, let him be; he was ultimately making grand considerations for the world’s literary lineage. Young Qi is such a promising seedling that it deserves extra protection, right? In the end, when one day he breaks through the bottleneck of the ascended realm, will the rules of the Rites Saint hold more weight than the Great Sage’s face?

In short, he found the Old Scholar today to be far from the scholarly demeanor he had expected.

That must be because he had never seen the Great Sage participate in a debate between the three schools.

The Old Scholar, who had just boasted about the literary lineage of the Great Sage never seeking help, was, in fact, a teacher of the disciples of the Great Sage and had desperately sought help in the past, sacrificing everything and giving a lot.

At the gate, the great sword immortal Zhang Lu was still napping with his sword in his embrace. He had witnessed the fate of the Rain Dragon Sect in the Haoran Realm and felt it was far from enough.

Zhang Lu would not extend a sword to the cultivators of the Haoran Realm, but he would absolutely not extend one for them either.

He was merely there to watch the excitement; after all, the Haoran Realm preferred to see the spectacle.

The former hidden official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Xiao Shen, along with the old hidden officials Luo Shan and Zhu An, and the two great demon monarchs, Chi Fei and Yang Zhi, who were responsible for breaking the path to Tongye Continent, were originally supposed to land on Tongye Continent together. However, Chi Fei and Yang Zhi, along with the three other great demons who had concealed their forms, suddenly changed course and headed to the vast sea between Baoping Continent and North Julu Continent. Only Xiao Shen, alone, forcibly breached the mountain and river barriers of a continent and broke through the formation of the Tongye Sect’s Wutong Heavenly Umbrella Mountain Water Array. Even as a sword cultivator, she still had to engage in hand-to-hand combat.

Transforming into a beam of sword light, she headed overseas. Xiao Shen had no interest in the Tongye Sect and ignored the ants below, spat on the ground, then turned and left in pursuit.

Although Xiao Shen had broken through the two great formation barriers and entered the territory of the Tongye Sect, she was still heavily restrained by the laws of heaven and earth, which left her quite displeased. So, as the left and right willingly departed from the land of Tongye Continent, Xiao Shen followed behind, rarely speaking a word on the battlefield, “Left and right, after taking a punch years ago, have your injuries healed? If I kill you, don’t blame me for taking advantage.”

Left and right were too lazy to speak; after all, the principles were all in the sword.

Xiao Shen was as headstrong as ever; since left and right wielded so much sword qi, they should smash as much as they could.

The cultivators of the Tongye Sect gazed upward at the two disappearing figures, most of them terrified and unsure of who the little girl with the braided hair was and which great demon she belonged to.

After Chen Chunan questioned the sword of the bearded man, there was temporarily no battle in Nan Posa Continent. The demon army of the Wildlands continued to move mountains and overturn seas, smashing countless mountains of the Wildlands into the ocean, paving roads, and gathering troops at sea, positioning themselves miles away in a standoff against Posa Continent. Occasionally, powerful cultivators from the Haoran Realm would use divine abilities to strike at the sea in support of the pure Confucian Chen clan, only to have great demons emerge to counter those impressive spells.

Among those who acted from Nan Posa Continent was an old ancestor from the Huai family, ranked among the bottom ten of Central Earth.

Fu Yao Continent had a renowned old sword immortal, Zhou Zhenzhi, personally stationed at the waters and caves that no longer had the ancestor's portrait.

The gentlemen scholars from Central Earth, Liu Xia Continent, and Aiai Continent had each hurried to the southwestern Fu Yao Continent, West Jin Jia Continent, and Nan Posa Continent.

At the now-defunct waters and caves of Fu Yao Continent, a tall old man stood outside the ancestral hall. Beside him was a young, handsome man, Qi Tingji from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In addition, there were several young individuals, among them a white-clad youth whose appearance surpassed Qi Tingji, a thirty-year-old mountain peak realm martial artist, Cao Ci. 

Also present were Cao Ci's three acquaintances: Liu Youzhou from Aiai Continent, Huai Qian from Central Earth, and the martial artist Yu Jianfu.

It seemed Huai Qian hadn’t fully recovered from a severe illness, his face pale, yet he showed no signs of weakness.

A Nascent Soul sword cultivator named Nalan Caihuan, claiming to come from the Downward Mountain Spring Fan Studio, was now the nominal master of the waters and caves, yet she was currently engaged in trade with a worldly dynasty. She had served as the steward of the Nalan family in the Sword Qi Great Wall for many years, amassing quite a bit of personal wealth. After entering the Haoran Realm, the restrictions from the Summer Palace and the hidden officials were not too strict, especially since the Sword Qi Great Wall no longer existed, what talk of hidden officials was there? However, Nalan Caihuan didn’t dare push her luck, unwilling to make any unethical money, especially since there was still a Lu Zhi in Nan Posa Continent, who seemed to have a good relationship with the young hidden official.

Just after the sword arrived at the Fu Yao Continent, Zhou Zhenzhi asked, “What about my nephew? No last words?”

Qi Tingji shook his head, “None.”

Zhou Zhenzhi said, “Having lived a useless life, he finally accomplished something grand. Ku Xia should have said a few words for himself. I heard there’s a rather shady tavern at the Sword Qi Great Wall; was there nothing written on the board by Ku Xia?”

Yu Jianfu shook her head, “None.”

Zhou Zhenzhi felt a bit regretful, “If I had known back then, I should have advised him that since he genuinely liked that woman, he might as well stay there. After all, when he returned to Central Earth, I wouldn’t have thought highly of him either. My disciple is a stubborn person, and the disciples he taught turned out the same way; it’s quite troubling.”

Yu Jianfu spoke quietly, “Grandpa Zhou, Ku Xia was never useless!”

Zhou Zhenzhi immediately smiled, nodding, “After all, he is my nephew. He’s not utterly useless; it’s just that my standards are high. Such words can only be said by me; outsiders wouldn’t dare speak carelessly.”

Liu Youzhou, having secretly come to Fu Yao Continent with the family’s approval, felt both excited and anxious. On this journey, he had brought no fewer than three items with him, packed full, eager to hand out treasures to anyone he met. As long as others were safe, he felt secure. Unfortunately, his good friends, Cao Ci and Huai Qian, hadn’t accepted anything, while Yu Jianfu, being purely a martial artist, felt it was inappropriate to decline. She merely took a piece of armor symbolically, leaving the rest, as Liu Youzhou indeed had a few decent items among his treasures.

Liu Youzhou cautiously glanced at Huai Qian, then at Yu Jianfu, feeling that the atmosphere was oddly tense.

Yu Jianfu had returned to the Haoran Realm from the Sword Qi Great Wall in recent years, breaking through to the Far Wanderer realm. However, Huai Qian seemed to have regressed significantly after returning from North Julu Continent, remaining stagnant at the Sea-Viewing realm without breaking through.

Indeed, North Julu Continent was not a place where outsiders should go; it was the easiest to suffer setbacks there. No wonder his parents could agree to everything and turn a blind eye to almost anything, but they absolutely forbade him from wandering around North Julu Continent. As for this journey to Fu Yao Continent, Liu Youzhou certainly wouldn’t stick around the waters and caves; with his limited cultivation, it wasn’t sufficient.

Cao Ci was the first to leave the ancestral hall of the waters and caves, intending to wander elsewhere for a change of mood.

Yu Jianfu hesitated for a moment before following Cao Ci. Zhou Zhenzhi stroked his beard and smiled, glancing at the sickly Huai Qian, who had been scheming and cunning since childhood. Zhou Zhenzhi had never liked him, having previously scolded Yu’s patriarch for being bewitched. However, it was ultimately the Yu family’s affair; while Zhou Zhenzhi could privately scold a few times, he couldn’t change anything.

As Huai Qian bid farewell to the two sword immortal seniors, he parted ways with Cao Ci and Yu Jianfu, while Liu Youzhou hesitated and decided to follow Huai Qian.

Liu Youzhou whispered, “What’s going on? Can you talk about it?”

Huai Qian smiled, “Cunning leads to trouble; one has to learn through enough bitter experiences.”

Liu Youzhou cautiously said, “Don’t blame me for prying, but Yu Jianfu and Cao Ci, really have nothing going on. Back during the ruins at Jin Jia Continent, Cao Ci was purely helping Yu Jianfu practice her martial arts; I was watching the whole time.”

Huai Qian shook his head, “I’m not blind; I know Yu Jianfu has no feelings for Cao Ci, and Cao Ci feels the same way toward Yu Jianfu. Furthermore, regarding that engagement between both families, I merely didn’t refuse, nor did I have any strong feelings.”

Liu Youzhou hesitated to speak further.

Huai Qian said, “What Yu Jianfu encountered at the Sword Qi Great Wall, and what experiences she went through, are of no importance.”

Over at Cao Ci’s side.

Yu Jianfu asked with a smile, “Is there some pressure? After all, he’s also at the peak realm.”

Cao Ci shook his head, gazing southward, full of spirit, “In the ten realms, it’s about ranking. I’m waiting for him to ask for a duel. I know he doesn’t care about winning or losing, but losing three times in front of the woman he loves will definitely make him want to regain his honor.”

Cao Ci turned his head, smiling at Yu Jianfu.

Yu Jianfu was busy eating pancakes, and since returning to the Haoran Realm, she found that this was the advantage—she raised her head in confusion, “What’s up?”

Cao Ci asked, “Are you thinking about something?”

Yu Jianfu blinked, “I don’t like Chen Ping’an. I lost to him three times at the Sword Qi Great Wall, so of course I want to regain my honor. What are you thinking about? It’s not like you, Cao Ci.”

Cao Ci said, “I wanted to ask you, when Chen Ping’an returns to the Haoran Realm, would you like to challenge him?”

Yu Jianfu chuckled, “Cao Ci, you’re a bit more talkative now; you’re not like your old self.”

Cao Ci said, “I’ll be stepping into the tenth realm here.”

Yu Jianfu nodded, “I’ll be waiting to see.”

After breaking through the Golden Core twelve times, he finally reached the peak realm.

However, after entering the ninth realm, breaking the Golden Core brought little benefit to martial arts, though there were still some advantages; thus, Chen Ping’an continued to break the Golden Core.

After three more times, it became completely useless, ultimately not aiding his martial arts cultivation. Only then did Chen Ping’an wrap things up and start preparing for his final Golden Core formation.

Before his last appearance, Li Zhen casually tossed a well-printed travelogue onto the cliff here, and afterward, she went to one end of the Sword Qi Great Wall and never showed up again.

After forming his Golden Core, Chen Ping’an had nothing to do, sitting cross-legged with his narrow sword resting on his knee, and began to read that satirical travelogue, unable to suppress a smile. The name Gu Chan was far less beautiful than the name Gu Can, which signified a gem of jade. As for the opening chapters regarding local customs, they were excellently written, reminding him of many old memories. Unfortunately, some things were not written down, and it was fortunate they weren’t.

Chen Ping’an tossed the travelogue over the city wall, letting it flutter away, unaware of where it would finally land.

With both hands pressing on the narrow sword, he gazed at the vast southern land. What was written was not what he genuinely cared about. If some matters were written down, future meetings would be hard to discuss properly.

For instance, the book didn’t mention a child once joyfully exclaiming in a narrow alley, “The smaller ones taste better.”

A martial artist in a bright red robe stood up. After stabilizing his physique, he no longer resembled a specter. Chen Ping’an walked slowly, lightly tapping his shoulder with the narrow sword, smiling and murmuring, “Fragments of peace, fragments of peace, may peace last year after year…”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 815: No Waiting for Breakthroughs

The cool breeze was sharp, the clouds hung low, hinting at snow, as the world seemed to blur at the edges, precarious and ethereal.

Far from home, unable to return to her roots, Liu Bai felt like a pitiful stray dog.

She gazed at the distant silhouette atop the city wall, holding on until her vision blurred before retracting her gaze. 

Her only regret was her low cultivation level, which prevented her from personally slaying that young hidden official who was her greatest enemy.

Liu Bai, the prodigious sword cultivator of the Jia Shen Banner (Jia Shen Zhang), was a high disciple of Zhou Mi, the "Sea of Literature" in the world. However, during that fateful ambush, where five sword cultivators were meant to succeed, the Jia Shen Banner was met with disappointment from the wild world. Among them, Liu Bai suffered the worst, having her neck brutally snapped by Chen Ping'an. If not for her soul being desperately gathered back, she would have had to use her life lamp afterward. Even if she could be reborn and cultivate a new life sword, she would be stuck at the Nascent Soul stage. Now, Liu Bai's ranking among the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain had plummeted to fifty-nine, no longer the unshakeable sword immortal she once was. However, if she could reach the Jade Purity Realm (Yu Pu), there was still a chance.

Choosing a position close to Long Jun for her training, Liu Bai had been watching and listening each time Chen Ping'an came here to provoke him.

After the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall was taken by the wild world, apart from those ten or so sword cultivators from Tuo Yue Mountain, including Shou Chen, Fei Ran, and Zhu Qiao, most had already gone to the Hao Ran world, while the rest were nurturing their flying swords atop the city walls.

Suddenly, Long Jun spoke up, “If you train your sword just to kill Chen Ping'an, to be honest, you absolutely won’t be able to do it. Either Chen Ping'an will be killed by me for failing to hold half the city, or he will escape by some inexplicable means. Even if you somehow manage to follow him, it will only end with you having your neck snapped again. When he strikes, it will be easier than the last time he killed you.”

Liu Bai's expression became complicated. “Long Jun, is there really no third possibility?”

Long Jun shook his head.

Liu Bai replied, “Then I’ll watch him die by your sword with my own eyes.”

Long Jun continued, “Shouldn’t you be worried about your own situation right now? You can’t break through, nor can you grasp even a wisp of ancient sword intent. What good is it to just sit here? Watching Chen Ping'an break through again? My earlier words were not mere jokes. If you are fortunate enough to practice on the city wall, and in the end turn out to be someone who can’t grasp anything, then there’s no need to go to the Hao Ran world to embarrass yourself. By then, Shou Chen won’t be able to protect you, and your master will be too lazy to protect you, because it would be your own death wish.”

Liu Bai stood up and bowed, “Thank you for your guidance, senior.”

Then she asked a question that had long piqued her curiosity, “Long Jun, since he has already aligned himself with half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, why can’t he grasp even a wisp of sword intent? Is it simply beyond his capability? Otherwise, given his nature, he would surely be frantically seizing sword intent.”

Long Jun chuckled, “I find this matter puzzling too. You might have the opportunity to ask your literary genius of a teacher, Zhou Cheng, if he has an answer. If he does, I will guide you in swordsmanship.”

Suddenly, Long Jun thrust out a sword, shattering a magnificent fist intent from across the way.

It was that young hidden official, Chen Ping'an, who had idly thrown a punch at the monstrous army of the foreign demon tribe.

Liu Bai bit her lip. 

Chen Ping'an’s punch, though Long Jun’s sword strike seemed casual and effortless in breaking the fist intent, was delivered by a throne-level sword immortal.

On the cliff opposite, that striking red robe contrasted sharply with Long Jun’s gray robe, creating a vivid dichotomy. After stepping into the mountain peak realm, even Liu Bai, who harbored a deep-seated animosity toward him, had to admit that Chen Ping'an exuded a formidable presence, his punch rising to the heavens. Not to mention, he was also a sword cultivator, possessing two uniquely peculiar life swords. How could she kill him? Deep inside, if Long Jun weren’t here keeping a close watch on Chen Ping'an, Liu Bai knew that practicing her sword here could very well mean instant death.

But she was here to train at her master’s behest. Her master had said that Chen Ping'an would be the heart demon she would face once she ascended to the Jade Purity Realm, so she needed to prepare herself early and cultivate her heart properly.

Liu Bai struggled to suppress the ripples in her heart lake and asked, “Long Jun, if striking out with fists and swords is destined to be futile, why does he keep coming here to wander?”

Liu Bai had done her research on that young hidden official, specifically asking the Jia Shen Banner’s leader, Mu Ji, and her senior brother Shou Chen, for detailed records about Chen Ping'an. This outsider to the Sword Qi Great Wall was incredibly meticulous, acting with great pragmatism. In battle, he was most adept at exchanging injuries for victories, not someone who relished putting on airs or showing off.

Long Jun replied with a smile, “Because that mad dog refuses to truly become a mad dog.”

Liu Bai felt puzzled but refrained from further questioning, returning to her seated position to nurture her sword intent.

After Chen Ping'an’s punch failed, his figure suddenly vanished, as if he had drifted off elsewhere to alleviate his boredom, merely greeting Long Jun.

Chen Ping'an stood atop a city wall, leaning on his sword.

He looked up at the sky. Though his vision was blurred, relying on the fleeting Jade Purity Realm cultivation he had borrowed, he clearly sensed the world’s cycle and knew that it was about to snow.

He truly anticipated the snow. Once it began to fall, it wouldn’t feel so desolate, allowing him to build a row of snowmen. From a distance, they would resemble birds perched on low branches.

Previously, Chen Ping'an had transcended to the Cave Dwelling stage from prison, becoming a mid-level five realm deity.

Reaching mid-level five was akin to crossing a great chasm. After this, the Observation Sea realm, Dragon Gate realm, and the formation of the Golden Core would be like a hot knife through butter.

These three barriers, apart from the unique intricacies of forming the Golden Core, previously only required effort in opening up the meridians for the Observation Sea and Dragon Gate realms.

Earlier, Shuang Jiang had wanted to use ten small summer coins to trade for a chance to escape from prison, initially seeking Chen Ping'an’s help for the covert protection of Ning Yao, and to pave the way for far-traveling sword cultivators in the fifth realm, hoping to prevent Qi Shou from becoming too powerful. Qi Shou had been selected as the new warden by the elder sword immortal, which was something Chen Ping'an had wanted. He initially intended for Qi Shou to take the position of hidden official, while sidelining the older hidden officials like Dong Bu De and Xu Ning, allowing the life lamp in Gao Ye Hou’s possession to be reignited. By the time the next generation’s Chen Xi was growing up, even if Qi Shou became a legitimate hidden official, he would have trouble creating any significant surprises.

From the beginning, Chen Ping'an had never intended for Ning Yao to become the second elder sword immortal. The next leader was destined to be the reincarnated head of the Chen family, Chen Xi.

However, since the elder sword immortal had chosen Qi Shou for the warden position, Chen Ping'an had his ways of responding. In the fifth realm, the warden lineage initially appeared to be powerful, overshadowing the hidden official and Gao Ye Hou lineages. However, in the future, non-sword cultivators and martial artists would not be allowed into the warden lineage, becoming a decisive weapon, and a clear scheme. The loss of a Sword Qi Great Wall meant that sword cultivators would inevitably dwindle. Even if purely martial cultivators increased, the warden lineage might still seem powerful, but they would have to contend with Nianxin, who would secretly restrain Qi Shou. The warden lineage would inevitably split into two major factions, with Jiang Yun and Yuan Zao Hua's martial apprentice group likely taking the lead in the fifth realm, and this group, in comparison to the hidden official lineage, would actually be the most passionate.

If Qi Shou truly had the capability to have Nianxin bring that group along to switch sides, then Qi Shou would undoubtedly overpower Chen Xi, taking all the power for himself. If he possessed such ambition and skill, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t mind having the ambitious Qi Shou lead the charge. However, if Qi Shou couldn’t even unify his own faction as a warden, what right did he have to lead the sword cultivators into this new world?

Ultimately, Chen Ping'an did not intend to target Qi Shou, nor did he have any personal grievances with him. His intention was to prevent Qi Shou from acting too extreme, causing the sword cultivators in the fifth realm to miss numerous advantageous situations due to the "first come, first served" principle. As cultivators from the three realms continued to enter, it would result in that city becoming a target, surrounded by enemies on all sides.

However, he hadn’t anticipated that dealing with Shuang Jiang would yield unexpected benefits. Now, Chen Ping'an realized that the deal might turn out to be the most lucrative he had made since assuming the mantle of the "Baggage Master."

For example, the ancient narrow knife, which had been used for executions on the Dragon Slaying Platform, helped him more quickly absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Shuang Jiang had also detailed the cultivation secrets of the Cave Dwelling, Observation Sea, and Dragon Gate realms, along with methods for refining large and medium items. For instance, refining something akin to the imitation of the Bai Yu Jing into a sword to assist in the main life item could purify the Five Elements energy that the small personal world produced. Moreover, instructions on how to refine the sword immortal’s flag atop the mountain shrine into two short swords, each engraved with the characters "Pollution" and "Lake," that would later be refined into the "Dragon Spring" of the Water Mansion.

Especially, Shuang Jiang had helped identify six locations serving as "Crown Prince Mountains" for the main life apertures, which simply required Chen Ping'an to go by the book to "open the mountains and establish the residence."

After aligning with half the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping'an was now at the pseudo-Jade Purity stage. Thus, in terms of cultivation, he could approach it from a high position, taking a bird’s eye view, allowing him to move forward without hindrance.

Regarding whether to form a Golden Core or to strive for a breakthrough at this moment, Chen Ping'an had his own considerations.

Ultimately, he chose to shatter the Golden Core, for a simple reason: currently, on the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, under Li Zhen’s orders, the military tent had issued a decree forbidding all demon tribes from crossing the winds. Throughout the year, not even a bird could be found, leaving an utterly desolate scene. If Li Zhen still had a bit of calculation in mind, then Long Jun was truly ruthless. Outside the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it seemed that a grand illusion was being cast, making everything except the sun and moon visible, while the mountains and rivers remained blurry.

Thus, atop this city wall, with the vastness of heaven and earth around him, Chen Ping'an was genuinely alone, possessing the fist of a far-traveling realm and the cultivation of a pseudo-Jade Purity sword cultivator, yet having no opponents at all. Therefore, whether he became a formidable Golden Core sword cultivator or not became largely insignificant.

Aside from that, as the old saying goes, in this world, few can enjoy the fruits without tasting the bitterness.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an found himself in an extremely peculiar situation, akin to returning to the days of apprenticeship at the kiln. His mind was quick, his eyes sharp, yet his hands were slow.

It felt as though every thought had traveled dozens of miles, yet the execution of these thoughts lagged far behind, moving at a snail's pace, with each step taken only a fraction of an inch, while his hands barely lifted at all.

Chen Ping'an could only watch himself move like an elderly man shuffling along, trapped not only by the fact that he couldn’t leave the Sword Qi Great Wall—otherwise, he would be instantly killed by Long Jun's sword—but also by the martial body he possessed, which felt like a prison he couldn't escape.

For Chen Ping'an, the saying "days drag on like years" had no exaggeration.

There was only one scenario that could help him regain his usual self, becoming smooth and adept again—that was, within the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, with pseudo-Jade Purity cultivation, he must not stop, shrinking the distance to the mountains and rivers, moving in accordance with his thoughts, disappearing in an instant, and racing around wildly. However, this seemingly carefree situation came with significant repercussions, as it would cause his soul to drift farther from his body, creating a widening rift between his heart and this earthly realm.

The ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain had clearly seen through Chen Ping'an's predicament when he had earlier intervened to stop that Xiao Jian from striking.

Without external assistance to help Chen Ping'an refine his physical body, he wouldn’t just struggle to advance to the mountain peak realm through the practice of punches; even maintaining his position in the far-traveling realm would be extremely difficult.

What made Chen Ping'an feel the most helpless was that after aligning with the Great Wall, he had completely lost the possibility of achieving a state of tranquility and forgetting his physical form. He had tried meditating like an old monk or forgetting himself as a Taoist, but to no avail. Even using half-hearted techniques like the Bone Observation had yielded no results. Even if Chen Ping'an wanted to slack off and not refine his Qi, he found it hard to do so; otherwise, he would have nothing to occupy himself with.

Li Zhen might not be good at fighting, but his intellect was sharp, coupled with Long Jun’s means. Over time, Chen Ping'an might become the first pure martial artist in history to have never been severely injured yet still fell into a decline.

Two blunt knives cut into him—one slicing into his martial body and the other eroding the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall. Those sword immortals from the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain behind Long Jun, without exception, were all talented sword cultivators. As they nurtured their flying swords and honed their sword intent, they gradually earned the recognition of ancient sword intent, drawing from the fortunes of the sword path. The more they gained, the more Chen Ping'an lost. It became a slow torment for him, as if he could only wait to die.

For this situation, even though Chen Ping'an had been prepared, he had underestimated the consequences that came after aligning with the Sword Qi Great Wall.

He drifted around the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall like a wandering ghost.

Ultimately, he couldn’t solve the real problem, and it would gradually harm his martial body.

But once he stood still or took a seat, even if Chen Ping'an wanted to ponder over past events, thirty years’ worth of time, with countless mountains and rivers traversed, many experiences, and numerous stories seen, how many times could he endure the repeated scrutiny of details?

The words he had etched onto bamboo slips had been recited over and over by him. Chen Ping'an had once tried to take out a nearby item, pulling some objects from it for distraction, like counting celestial coins, but he had nearly been shattered by Long Jun’s sword while doing so.

Outside of cultivation, he could only focus on cultivation.

Otherwise, if he were to stay here for just one year on the city wall, it would feel to Chen Ping'an like passing through a prolonged cycle of a hundred years. How would he cope if it extended to five, ten, or even a hundred years?

He might lose his mind.

Chen Ping'an had to concentrate his spirit, focusing solely on his cultivation. His breakthroughs were accelerating, but once he reached the seemingly not-so-distant Golden Core realm, which was just a step away from becoming a sword immortal, it suddenly made it difficult for him to feel at ease, especially once he successfully reached the bottleneck of the Golden Core. He had previously appeared calm and composed in the presence of the Outland Demons and Shuang Jiang, but in reality, he held deep fear.

The experiences of Liu Lao Cheng from Book Slip Lake, Shuang Jiang's very existence, and the distant Outland Demons all left Chen Ping'an feeling anxious. In the end, he truly wasn’t afraid of suffering; he was most afraid of himself.

Thus, Chen Ping'an began to take risks, finally breaking through to become a Golden Core cultivator, only to start shattering his Golden Core!

After all, a person couldn’t scare themselves to death, suffocate themselves, or stagnate.

Having shattered one golden literary core, what was another shattering of a Golden Core?

Once the Golden Core shattered, thoughts or the absence of thoughts became irrelevant, and his martial body was forced to endure, refining itself as the great path turned without his control.

However, every time he shattered his Golden Core, the torment felt akin to taking a devastating punch from Senior Cui at Falling Down Mountain, and he would remain dazed, enduring it bit by bit, while feeling as if he was experiencing a protracted day.

Previously, after shattering twelve times, it felt as if ten years had passed. However, after successfully entering the mountain peak realm, shattering his Golden Core three more times felt much easier.

Thinking back to the prolonged pain of a shattered Golden Core, Chen Ping'an muttered to himself, “I am truly enjoying life now.”

He suddenly cursed loudly.

It turned out that Long Jun had struck, disturbing the atmospheric conditions above half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, and the snow that had been anticipated was now destined never to fall.

Chen Ping'an began to sit down, spreading his palms and raising them high, performing the Five Thunder Seals, smashing down towards the city’s outer edge.

Then he stood up and began to perform the six-step stance. Since he was bound to move slowly, he might as well see just how slow he could get, treating it as a competition against himself.

He inadvertently remembered the set of boxing techniques taught to him by Zhang Shan Feng and began to imitate them, regardless of whether they resembled the original techniques. After all, it was just a way to pass the time, nurturing his Golden Core while practicing his punches, even if it meant a million punches.

Not only that, but Chen Ping'an also intended to slowly walk from one end of the city wall to the cliff's edge.

When Chen Ping'an finally arrived at the cliff's edge, retracting his fist stance, he looked towards the gray-robed figure drifting lightly in the wind and asked, “What’s going on with the Rain Dragon Sect?”

Long Jun rasped, “Why bother asking such obvious questions? It’s rather boring.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Since we both have nothing to do, why not chat about some trivial history?”

Long Jun fell silent.

Li Zhen suddenly floated down to the cliff's edge on his sword and landed gracefully. Unlike his usual casual stance, he chose to stand a bit closer to Long Jun this time, wearing a smile.

Chen Ping'an, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, smiled and said, “You’re a dog, aren’t you? Your nose is so sharp. It’s a pity I didn’t step in any filth; you could check under Long Jun’s robe to see if you can have a feast.”

Li Zhen waved his hand, grinning, “Hidden Official, don’t be so quick-witted. That would be beneath me, but I don’t mind. I’ve come today to tell you three good pieces of news. Liu Bai has obtained a wisp of sword intent from the Zhou Cheng lineage. Yu Si has acquired a wisp from Wu Cheng Pei. I also have a small gain. Sigh, it feels a bit guilty to profit from the dead.”

Regarding these opportunities, Chen Ping'an felt no ripple in his heart.

Sword cultivators were just sword cultivators, the far-traveling guests with the purest Dao hearts between heaven and earth.

Li Zhen asked, “Hidden Official, guess from which fallen sword immortal I obtained the sword intent? Take a guess, it hasn’t been many years since he died, and he was a great sword immortal.”

Li Zhen produced his flying sword, and with a slight thought, gathered a sea of clouds beyond the city wall.

Chen Ping'an's expression darkened, gripping the narrow knife in his hand, then enduring it, he finally erupted in curses. Suddenly, his expression changed, and he lazily smiled, “Satisfied? Happy?”

Li Zhen asked, “How did you figure it out?”

The innate flying sword of Yao Chong Dao could gather clouds and seas.

Of course, Li Zhen had asked the city’s sword immortals for help, deliberately trying to irritate Chen Ping'an.

The rankings of the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain did not categorize by cultivation level; it included both young sword cultivators at the Cave Dwelling stage and renowned great sword immortals like Shou Chen.

Chen Ping'an smirked, “I can think with my knees better than you can with your brain. What skills do you truly possess, Li Zhen? Why don’t you come over here and spar? I won’t draw my sword and won’t bully you with my Jade Purity cultivation, I’ll keep my realm at the far-traveling stage. How about it? If you’re unsure, it’s fine. I’ll let Liu Bai join in; after all, her pathway to the Great Dao bottleneck in the upper five realms surely lies with me. This is just the chance for her to eliminate her heart demon. According to that travelogue, I treat women with the utmost care. Last time, I accidentally snapped her neck; that was my fault.”

Liu Bai merely sat quietly, seemingly ignoring their banter.

The two sides of the Sword Qi Great Wall were almost like two different worlds, so Chen Ping'an might not fully grasp Liu Bai's heart lake. However, Li Zhen understood that Liu Bai was far from as calm as she appeared.

Li Zhen asked, “Over on the Hao Ran side, did anyone tell you that you would become another extreme version of Chen Ping'an? If so, I truly want to be friends with him, for he has spoken my mind.”

Chen Ping'an replied with a smile, “Yes, the scholar Fu Nan Hua from Qing Feng City.”

There actually was someone, but it certainly wasn’t Fu Nan Hua from Qing Feng City; it was Li Bao Zhen.

Li Zhen scoffed, “Qing Feng City is surnamed Xu, while Lao Long City has the surname Fu.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “You’d do better thinking with your backside than your brain. You should switch it up from now on, and don’t forget to eat too.”

Teasing Li Zhen was one of the few comforting things he could do. As for whether Li Zhen cared or not, Chen Ping'an wasn’t truly his ancestor, so he didn’t care.

Li Zhen was unwilling to waste time discussing such matters, smiling, “Even if you manage to escape back to the Hao Ran world by luck, even if you’re in good fortune, before that, what the last hidden official of the Sword Qi Great Wall did has already become widely known. But what do the hearts of the mountain cultivators truly think of you, Chen Ping'an? No matter how many good deeds you do over a hundred or a thousand years, how long you act as a good person, ‘Chen the Good’ will always be a false gentleman stemming from the lineage of the Scholar Sage.”

Chen Ping'an stifled a laugh.

Li Zhen frowned, “Is it funny?”

Chen Ping'an glanced at Long Jun, “Would you mind explaining this to this little fool, Long Jun?”

Long Jun smiled, “He’s just a lowly brat raised on insults. Why care about such things? The Scholar Sage lineage has so few descendants; who would care? Cui Zhan? Probably?”

Chen Ping'an smiled at Li Zhen, “Let me teach you one last principle: good deeds done by false gentlemen are still good deeds. True scoundrels, no matter how many unscrupulous acts they commit, remain scoundrels. As for you, you can’t even manage to be a false gentleman, nor do you have the ability to be a true scoundrel—do you even have the face to question me? Do you deserve it?”

Chen Ping'an extended his hand, lightly clenched his fist, “Not like a true grandfather and grandson, but accounts must be settled. Let me teach you this lesson, and you will remember to repay it with your life in the future.”

If it weren't for Long Jun stationed at the opposite city wall, with only the nonsense of the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain practicing there, Chen Ping'an would have already struck.

Li Zhen tilted his head, extending his neck and pointing, laughing, “Chop over here?”

Chen Ping'an reached out, grasping the narrow knife placed far away atop the city wall, wielding it in hand. The sheath remained in place as he drew the narrow knife, resembling a long rainbow as it streaked forward.

Chen Ping'an swung his knife.

Li Zhen mistakenly thought Long Jun would help block it, so he didn’t dodge. The result was that he lost a precious protective treasure on the spot, crashing heavily dozens of feet away, soaked in blood, sitting on the ground, “Long Jun!”

Long Jun struck, “killing” Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an’s form reappeared in place.

Long Jun’s strikes were always precise, providing no benefit to Chen Ping'an’s physical body.

Li Zhen rose, shaking off the bloodstains from his robe, looking pale and fierce, smiling, “Chen Ping'an, Falling Down Mountain, huh? When I break through, I’ll head to the Bao Ping Continent. As long as they are familiar with you, I will help you kill your enemies, and draw closer to those who are close to you.”

Suddenly, a Nascent Soul Dharma form appeared behind Chen Ping'an, “Is there a need to wait for a breakthrough?”

Li Zhen hurriedly retreated, like a startled bird.

Long Jun sighed, “False. The person is currently at the Jade Purity stage; is it difficult to conjure a Dharma form?”

Actually, Li Zhen was fine, merely startled, but Liu Bai was beginning to tremble slightly, as if she had caught a glimpse of her own heart demon.

Chen Ping'an turned around and laughed, leaving.

---

In the Shao Yuan Dynasty, at the National Teacher’s Mansion.

The white-clad youth Lin Jun Bi had removed his shoes and was sitting in the corridor, composing music. Since returning home, he had begun to shut himself away in seclusion, and even his teacher helped him refuse visitors.

Everything that transpired after Lin Jun Bi returned home unfolded as Mr. Cui and the young hidden official had predicted.

He was no longer merely the disciple of the National Teacher of the Shao Yuan Dynasty or simply the first young genius of the Shao Yuan Dynasty. He was recognized as the seed of learning by the entire Central Land of the Divine Continent’s academies.

Among the fellow sword cultivators, Jiang Guan Cheng had initially wanted to greatly embellish Lin Jun Bi’s achievements at the Sword Qi Great Wall in the capital. However, just as things began to take shape, after a feast, he was summoned to his father’s study that evening, where he received a scolding, questioning whether he wanted to be removed from the family tree and expelled from the ancestral hall. His father didn’t elaborate, and Jiang Guan Cheng never understood where he had gone wrong, as he was merely trying to do a good deed. Why did it feel like he had committed a heinous crime? His father only said that the strict laws were even harsher than when he was with Lin Jun Bi; did he ever say a single word?

Today, two guests arrived: Jin Zhen Meng and Zhu Mei.

Zhu Mei had been saved by Jin Zhen Meng on the battlefield in a foreign land, and Lin Jun Bi had also saved her.

This was more than just sharing hardships; it was a bond forged in life and death.

During that journey, Zhu Mei's impression of Lin Jun Bi had shifted from good to extremely good.

Of course, there was no romantic implication. However, it was precisely because of Zhu Mei’s heartfelt recognition of Lin Jun Bi that in the eyes of certain prominent figures, some rumors about Lin Jun Bi became all the more credible.

Upon hearing the news, Lin Jun Bi glanced at his shoes but did not put them on, intending to go barefoot to the small courtyard, but hesitated for a moment and decided to wear his shoes. He stood at the steps, waiting for the two to show up at the door before beaming, “Rare guest, rare guest.”

Lin Jun Bi extended his hand towards Jin Zhen Meng, saying, “According to our agreement, bring out the good wine.”

The usually stoic Jin Zhen Meng surprisingly joked, “The honorable Golden Core bottleneck sword cultivator, your earthly immortal senior comes to see you, you should treat her with good wine.”

Lin Jun Bi nodded, “There’s wine, there’s wine—authentic mute lake wine, one of a kind!”

Zhu Mei was delighted; they were all fellow countrymen from the Shao Yuan Dynasty. However, compared to the journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall, their relationship was vastly different.

Therefore, Zhu Mei teased, “Jun Bi, how’s that girl that Yu Jie introduced to you? How’s her chess skills? Is she so focused on winning that she forgets to look at her appearance, or is it that she’s so beautiful that you lost the game?”

Lin Jun Bi smiled, “Her chess skills are decent, and she’s more beautiful than you.”

Zhu Mei gave a thumbs-up, “Jun Bi, you’re a true honest person!”

Zhu Mei, Lin Jun Bi, and Jin Zhen Meng took their seats in the corridor, surveying their surroundings. “The scenery here is truly nice, suitable for cultivating the heart and nurturing one’s nature.”

Lin Jun Bi pointed to a large stone surrounded by swirling mist, taller than a person, and said, “This stone was pulled up from the bottom of the Mysterious Lake, and it has made my teacher’s pocket feel lighter.”

Lin Jun Bi’s teacher was the national teacher of the sixth great dynasty of the Hao Ran world, having had quite a few grievances with the Scholar Sage lineage.

Several scholars from the Shao Yuan Dynasty had once traveled far and wide together to the temple site of the Scholar Sage, personally smashing the statue of the Scholar Sage that had been removed from the temple. After returning home, their careers had blossomed, and they rose rapidly. However, after several attempts to visit the national teacher’s mansion, they had been unable to meet with the national teacher. Instead, they had been personally guided in chess by the national master, Xi Lu.

Jin Zhen Meng took the wine jar Lin Jun Bi had brought back from the Sword Qi Great Wall, took a sip, and softly said, “Even after returning home for so long, I still often feel as though I’ve returned to a different world. Every time I wake up, my flying sword is already summoned to my side. As a result, my progress in sword cultivation has been extremely slow, and I struggle to break through the bottleneck, failing to live up to the ancient sword intent I gained from the city wall.”

Among the talented sword cultivators of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, not many had obtained sword intent from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Jin Zhen Meng had acquired one wisp, Yan Lv had obtained one, while Zhu Mei had no such opportunity. Yet, Lin Jun Bi had gained three wisps one after another, thanks to the fact that he later entered the Summer Retreat Palace as a sword cultivator of the hidden official lineage, with fewer opportunities to fight outside the city. Otherwise, he might have been able to gain another wisp of pure sword intent.

Zhu Mei felt a bit embarrassed, “I’m fine; I just occasionally have nightmares that wake me up. My family later bought me some calming incense, and I’ve seldom had nightmares since.”

Lin Jun Bi took a sip of wine and said, “The reason I feign seclusion here is merely a means to quietly gain fame; it’s rather dull. However, I truly feel hesitant about going back to the Sword Qi Great Wall for combat.”

Jin Zhen Meng sighed in relief; today was not in vain. Lin Jun Bi was still the Lin Jun Bi in her heart. This wine was satisfying to drink, and Jin Zhen Meng took a big gulp, wiping her mouth and laughing, “It’s a pity that Yu Jianfu went to the Fu Yao Continent; otherwise, we would have arranged to see you together.”

Zhu Mei said quietly, “That one who always smiles and is cheerful, Huai Qian, seems to have followed my family’s Xi to the Fu Yao Continent, to a place called the Water and Mountain Cave.”

Lin Jun Bi was the first foreign sword cultivator to leave the Summer Retreat Palace.

Deng Liang, Cao Gun, and Xuan Can all left the Sword Qi Great Wall later than him.

It’s just that it remains unknown if they followed their fellow sword immortal seniors when leaving the upside-down mountain, or if they brought along a couple of sword immortal seeds from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Unfortunately, every foreign sword immortal that returned to the Hao Ran world had not made any noise or communication, much like Lin Jun Bi, choosing not to mention the war at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Lin Jun Bi dispersed his thoughts and intentionally lowered his voice, imitating Zhu Mei, “That famous Huai Qian, what does he look like? Ever caught your heart?”

Zhu Mei shook the wine jar, joking, “Having seen Lin Jun Bi first, any other man’s looks seem mediocre.”

Lin Jun Bi smiled, “Wait until you see Cao Ci before saying that.”

Zhu Mei indeed did not hold back, expressing great regret, “What a pity I haven’t seen him. In the future, I must drag Xi and Xi to the Da Duan Dynasty to meet that white-clad Cao Ci and see the divine martial god, Pei Wu Shen!”

Jin Zhen Meng suddenly looked a bit shy, hesitating for a long time, yet still couldn’t help but ask in a soft voice, “Jun Bi, do you know where Situ Wei Ran has gone? Is it to the fifth realm? If you can say it, go ahead, but if it involves the secrets of the Summer Retreat Palace, just pretend I didn’t ask.”

Lin Jun Bi shook his head, “As for Situ Wei Ran’s whereabouts, I truly don’t know, but I can try to ask. Recently, my teacher mentioned that Chen San Qiu and Die Zhang are currently in the Central Land of the Divine Continent; they just visited the Li Ji Academy.”

Jin Zhen Meng raised her wine jar, thanking Lin Jun Bi.

Zhu Mei said, “What about that hidden official of yours? Previously, the martial phenomenon was too grand, and it was said to be heading towards the old site of the upside-down mountain. So now there are many rumors, saying that the two worlds are intertwined, making it increasingly difficult for martial artists to break through to the strongest realm. Isn’t Chen Ping'an a pure martial artist? Could it be him? But that doesn’t make sense; the Sword Qi Great Wall has been breached.”

Lin Jun Bi remained silent for a long time and shook his head, “I don’t know.”

In the air above the central part of Tong Ye Continent, a priceless Liuxia treasure boat carried a diligent Nascent Soul Jiang priest and two exceptionally beautiful women.

At the other end of the boat lay a black-clad man in his prime, named Cao Jun, who had reportedly been a military cultivator of Great Li for many years.

The two women were Sui You Bian, who had rushed from the Book Slip Lake’s True Realm Sect to Tong Ye Continent, holding an oil-paper umbrella with a phoenix handle. The other was Ya Er, who had been Jiang Shang Zhen’s maid for many years.

This was the entrance to the Lotus Root Blessed Land.

The phoenix umbrella was personally handed to Sui You Bian by Cui Dong Shan, along with a secret letter asking her to deliver it to Jiang Shang Zhen.

Sui You Bian was accompanied by a woman who had once been by the side of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land’s Demon Lord Ding Ying, Ya Er, who had followed “Zhou Fei” as she ascended from the blessed land.

Back then, at the Spring Tide Palace, the Zhan Hua Lang Zhou Shi, along with Jian Zhan Feng “Sword Immortal” Lu Fang, rushed away from the capital of the Nan Yuan Kingdom to prevent being pursued and killed by Chen Ping'an, who had a heavenly identity. However, it remains unclear why the Spring Tide Palace and Jian Zhan Feng remained while Zhou Shi and Lu Fang were no longer in the blessed land.

Ya Er had returned to her homeland multiple times. Yet due to her responsibilities, she needed to leave often, following the Jiang priest and Sui You Bian to open the blessed land’s prohibitions and accommodate the refugees.

Among those returning to the former Lotus Flower Blessed Land were also a fellow countryman, Wei Xian, the founding emperor of the Nan Yuan Kingdom, who was now in the capital and had not left.

Additionally, there were two people from the Great Quan Dynasty on Tong Ye Continent, one a perceptive young man with a limp and the other an old hunchback nicknamed San Ye.

And then there was the carefree sword cultivator, who wore two swords of varying lengths at his waist, his peach blossom eyes resembling those of a woman. To Ya Er, this fellow named Cao Jun was decent-looking, but his mouth was a bit too reckless. He came from the Nan Po Sa Continent but was originally from the Li Zhu Cave Heaven in Bao Ping Continent, always bringing up his ancestral home in that mud bottle alley. Ya Er didn’t understand what was so noteworthy about being from the mud bottle alley; she had only heard that the True Martial Mountain’s Ma Ku Xuan was from the Apricot Blossom Alley in Li Zhu Cave Heaven.

She had once mustered the courage to ask Wei Xian, but to no avail.

For Ya Er, Wei Xian and Sui You Bian were indeed “ancient figures,” and they were the number one in the history of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Thus, even after following Jiang Shang Zhen for many years, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of reverence towards the two.

When they first arrived at the Lotus Root Blessed Land, they followed Wei Xian to the capital of the Nan Yuan Kingdom.

The atmosphere was undoubtedly strange.

A founding emperor who had been dead for countless years squatted beside the dragon throne, tapping and knocking, with his back turned to the descendants from generations ago.

The refugees had previously been divided into two groups by Jiang Shang Zhen, settling in the Lotus Root Blessed Land. 

Wei Xian, Sui You Bian, Ya Er, and Cao Jun, along with an ancient spirit that secretly guarded Cao Jun, plus a few inconsequential figures from the Great Quan Dynasty.

In addition, there was a batch of Jiang family descendants, all helping to oversee the waves of refugees flooding into the Lotus Root Blessed Land.

One group consisted of mountain villagers frantically migrating north, while the other was made up of mountain cultivators and their disciples and families. 

The former entered the blessed land without paying a single copper coin.

The latter had it worse; wanting to avoid the long journey across continents and seas to Bao Ping Continent, only to potentially die along the way, they had to pay a hefty sum of celestial coins, calculated per head and based on their cultivation levels. For lower five realm cultivators, it was a small summer coin each; for mid-five realm deities, they owed a Gu Yu coin per person. If they had no money, they could borrow or be kicked out. Anyone daring to forcefully enter the blessed land would first be beaten half to death by the Yu Gui Sect and the Jiang priest before being sent away.

According to Jiang Shang Zhen’s instructions, this toll was genuinely a life-saving fee; how could a mountain cultivator deity not be worth a small summer coin or a Gu Yu coin?

However, no matter how much money was offered, the blessed land wouldn’t accept any Nascent Soul cultivators.

Additionally, local officials and nobles from secular dynasties also had their own statuses to consider. To enter the blessed land for refuge, they needed to pay fees based on official ranks. Those without celestial coins were asked to borrow from their celestial friends; if they couldn’t do that, they had to exchange their valuables. There were people among the Jiang family descendants who were knowledgeable; antiques, treasured items, ancestral paintings, and palace secrets could all be used as currency. If someone hid their identity too much—like pretending to be a merchant when they were clearly a noble from a high family—they would be thrown out of the blessed land, leaving behind half of their belongings, allowing them to travel through the blessed land and enjoy the beautiful scenery without paying?

In the remote corners of the Lotus Root Blessed Land, Jiang Shang Zhen had early on delineated two large territories, separated by vast distances, and had the two priests of the Yu Gui Sect and the Jiang family respectively demarcate mountains and rivers, establishing prohibitions to minimize the flow of heaven and earth’s spiritual energy being drawn by those foreign cultivators, while also preventing the common folk entering the blessed land from contaminating its fortune. Although it was impossible to completely block the flow of energy and fortune, with the establishment of the mountain and river prohibitions, it was at least better than the worst-case scenarios that Wei Ban and Mi Yu had worried about.

Among them, the Nan Yuan Kingdom had secretly mobilized a thousand elite cavalry to patrol the borders, led personally by Wei Xian, although his public identity was merely that of a newly appointed military general.

It wasn’t that no cultivator found out that those mountain ants had entered the blessed land without paying and began to stir up trouble.

What was most chilling about Jiang Shang Zhen was that after receiving the money, he didn’t announce the rules in advance; the two Nascent Soul priests and a batch of Jiang descendants only began declaring the two rules after slaying a large group of cultivators.

The first rule was that any energy cultivator entering the blessed land must cherish their lives. No wandering about; people would die. Anyone who dared to cross the border and engage in conflict with the locals would be killed on the spot without question.

The second rule was that anyone who slandered Jiang Shang Zhen, the savior, would also die for their ingratitude.

The last, unofficial rule was that if anyone wanted revenge, come to the Yu Gui Sect to find Jiang Shang Zhen and make your request.

Currently, a small phoenix umbrella could accommodate over a hundred thousand refugees who had fled their homes.

Ultimately, cultivators were still a minority, and along with the miscellaneous people accompanying the energy cultivators, the total number was only over six thousand.

In this process, how to balance between lives and celestial coins, how to differentiate between close and distant relationships, and the intricacies of human selfishness were all laid bare.

Regardless, Jiang Shang Zhen’s actions saved more lives than Cui Dong Shan had anticipated, exceeding by thirty thousand. Not only that, but through the ploy of killing the rich to aid the poor, he ensured that the Lotus Root Blessed Land, a middle-tier blessed land, would not be downgraded to a lower-tier blessed land. Once the celestial coins were refined, even after deducting the expenses for establishing the mountain and river prohibitions, the spiritual energy of the blessed land could still increase by at least ten percent.

Moreover, Jiang Shang Zhen had no intention of merely trading; having too much money was bothersome; the joy lay in making money.

As for the many secular nobles hiding among the mountain cultivators, after moving, they were genuinely rich. Many mountain aristocrats were no less wealthy than a certain Golden Core earthly immortal’s purse. Not to mention, with Jiang Shang Zhen’s wealth, his various means were numerous. After settling in the Lotus Root Blessed Land, would he not want to continue living in luxury? Would he not need to stay in a celestial mansion? Would he not want to enjoy mountain delicacies every day, worthy of their noble status? Wouldn’t he need some charming performers to alleviate his boredom?

Thus, this became the main source of income for the Lotus Root Blessed Land. This group of people paid willingly.

On the Liuxia treasure boat, Ya Er said, “Sui Sister, we just need to circle the northern ferry a bit more, and you can take the phoenix umbrella back to Bao Ping Continent.”

Sui You Bian nodded.

At the boat’s tail, Cao Jun approached and said, “Since things are nearly settled, I won’t head to the ferry; you don’t need to worry about me.”

Sui You Bian said, “Suit yourself.”

Cao Jun stepped out of the Liuxia boat, riding the wind away, seemingly heading towards Tong Ye Sect.

The reason Cao Jun didn’t return directly to Bao Ping Continent but instead chose to part ways with Wei Xian and Sui You Bian was to seek out the one who had shattered his sword heart.

If it weren’t for that person, Cao Jun, as the top sword immortal seed of the Nan Po Sa Continent, wouldn’t have remained stuck at the Golden Core bottleneck for so long.

Cao Jun’s heart lake had once held a grand vision.

After his sword heart was destroyed, he quickly became a laughingstock across the continent. He had since fallen into despair, caring little for anything, living a wandering life. There was a later peer who had overtaken him, jokingly saying that the left was indeed a scholar, knowing how to leave the dry lotus to listen to the rain.

Such words had been spoken directly to Cao Jun. 

At that time, after hearing it, Cao Jun had simply smiled and nodded in agreement.

By the riverside of Tong Ye Sect, beside a thatched cottage, Cao Jun came across a man who had reportedly just returned from the sea with a gathered sword.

Rumor had it that the entire northwestern coastline had been thoroughly ravaged by the left and an unidentified girl.

Fortunately, unless half of Tong Ye Continent sank beneath the sea, that three-yuan four-象大阵 would continue to exist.

Cao Jun looked at the man and smiled, “Great Sword Immortal Zuo, a pleasure.”

Zuo asked, “Who are you?”

Cao Jun was momentarily speechless. 

Did you not destroy my sword heart back then and now don’t even remember who I am?

Cao Jun said, “I am a sword cultivator from Nan Po Sa, Cao Jun.”

Zuo thought for a moment and remembered, “What do you want?”

Cao Jun said sternly, “Zuo, don’t you dare die; I still want to ask you about swords in the future.”

Zuo glanced at Cao Jun and asked two questions, “Do you dare to stay here? Do you want to return to Nan Po Sa as a sword immortal?”

Cao Jun hesitated for a moment, then smiled and nodded, “What’s there to fear? Why not?”

Zuo nodded, “Then stay; you finally have the appearance of a sword cultivator.”

Cao Jun gritted his teeth, enduring for a long time but still couldn’t hold back, angrily saying, “Zuo! Stop acting so nonchalant! I’ve been thoroughly tricked by you!”

Zuo asked two more questions: “Relying on not being injured, you want to ask me about swords? I’ll just stand still while you keep attacking; who dies first?”

Cao Jun turned and walked away, choosing not to engage. 

Just then, Wang Shizi and Yu Xin arrived, seeking Zuo’s guidance on something.

Regarding the identity of the sword cultivator from Nan Po Sa, they had some guesses.

Yu Xin softly said, “Since you can ask Great Sword Immortal Zuo about swords, you must be an upper five realm sword immortal, right?”

Wang Shizi nodded, “Logically, that would be the case, but they don’t seem like it; they might be concealing their sword immortal aura. After all, not just anyone dares to ask Great Sword Immortal Zuo about swords. Generally, even Jade Purity cultivators don’t dare to, let alone the top ten sword immortals at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Cao Jun had achieved great success in refining his heart over the years and had nearly been driven to death by Zuo, but he was also nearly driven to death by those two bastards.

However, when Cao Jun turned to look at the two, he still wore a slight smile.

Sword immortals, you’re all grand figures.

Once Cao Jun left, Wang Shizi and Yu Xin told Zuo about the matter. After getting the answer, they were about to leave, but upon seeing Yu Xin still standing there, Wang Shizi thought there might be something left unsaid, so he stayed behind.

Yu Xin glanced at him, and Wang Shizi smiled back out of courtesy.

Yu Xin blushed and glared, then swiftly rode the wind away, leaving Wang Shizi perplexed.

Zuo watched the two strange individuals with a knowing smile, thinking they were likely celestial companions?

At Falling Down Mountain, an ancient well had been temporarily placed beside the small pond at the back of a bamboo house, having been relocated from a small town.

Mi Yu stood beside the well, while Xiao Mi Li leaned over the well’s edge, calling out, “Is anyone there? Can you hear me? I’m Zhou Mi Li, the incredibly fearless Zhou Mi Li, vice leader of the Right Guardian, the giant water monster of Mute Lake! If you can’t hear me, I’ll say it again…”

Wei Ban softly said, “Cui Dong Shan only said this is the reward from the Great Li Dynasty regarding the dissolution of the contract; it barely counts as a small cave heaven. Once that phoenix umbrella returns to Falling Down Mountain, I’ll see if I can connect the cave heavens, though the possibility is slim; I’m just going to give it a try.”

Mi Yu laughed, “At least it’s a good thing.”

Then Mi Yu said in a soft voice, “As for that insidiously crafted travelogue, Wei Shan Jun, you should keep an eye on it; don’t let it be passed into Falling Down Mountain by someone with ulterior motives. If Warm Tree and Mi Li see it, those two girls will surely cry out, and I won’t be able to stop myself from going out to chop someone.”

Wei Ban nodded, “Of course.”

Mi Yu said, “But regarding Pei Qian, I’m afraid there’s little hope.”

Wei Ban said, “With Li Huai by Pei Qian’s side, it shouldn’t be a big problem.”

---

In the capital of the Nan Yuan Kingdom, near the White Cloud Temple.

A refined and handsome youth in white, holding a hiking staff in one hand and leading a child with the other, strode into the room where the chicken soup monk was located.

The old monk smiled and asked, “Why didn’t you take off your shoes before entering?”

Cui Dong Shan sat cross-legged, hands clasped on his knees, his body slightly leaning forward, smiling, “Didn’t you see? I’m not wearing shoes!”

The old monk said softly, “Initial thoughts are shallow, turning thoughts deep, then turning thoughts deep to see the essence. This thought gradually deepens, discerning the human heart, but may not see the true heart.”

Cui Dong Shan shook his sleeves, raised his hand, revealing three incense sticks.

Asking a high monk about Buddhist teachings, if the listener gains insights, it is a grand ceremony of three incense and nine bows. If nothing is gained, then even one stick of incense will not be lit.

Cui Dong Shan smiled, “Asking about the topic doesn’t help me at all.”

The old monk nodded, “You have your reasoning.”

Cui Dong Shan laughed heartily, lit the three incense sticks, and released his hand, letting them hang in mid-air. For a moment, green smoke curled gently within the room.

This old monk was well-versed in the various tenets of Buddhism. If the situation hadn’t been what it was, Cui Dong Shan would have loved to chat with him for days.

The old monk glanced at the child, nodding, “That’s fine.”

Cui Dong Shan joined his hands together, bowed his head in Buddhist greeting.

The old monk returned the gesture.

Cui Dong Shan extended his hand, and the old monk took out a silver coin, placing it in the youth’s hand, saying, “Take it.” 

After wandering through the market at the Nai He Pass outside the Ghost Valley, Pei Qian and Li Huai continued their journey, accompanied by a taciturn Golden Core female immortal, Wei Tai Zhen.

There were many places to visit, including Jin Duo Temple, Mute Lake, Huai Huang Kingdom, and Bao Xiang Kingdom.

Wei Tai Zhen didn’t quite understand why they insisted on hiking through the mountains from the Bone Marsh to Spring Dew Garden, which was quite a distance.

However, she truly didn’t dare to say a word.

That day, they left the official road, turned onto a small path, and finally entered a deep mountain forest, quickly ascending a clearly marked path, with Pei Qian gently waving her hiking staff, saying, “The Mountain Lord’s Great Worm is about to appear, not blocking my way in the deep mountains. The wind is high, the moon is dark, and it’s eerie; all travelers retreat! What to do?!”

Li Huai chimed in, “Run!”

“Hey, that rhymes quite well.”

“Flattery.”

Pei Qian suddenly stopped speaking, lightly leaping onto a high branch to look up the path ahead, letting a falling tree trunk drop to the ground, “There are people ahead, but they look like a group of scholars. They don’t seem like martial practitioners or any mountain spirits or demons.”

Li Huai said, “Then they’re probably like us, financially constrained, unable to afford the celestial ferry.”

Pei Qian paused again, listening attentively.

Wei Tai Zhen felt puzzled, then her heart was shaken. This Pei Qian could actually hear the mountain’s movements earlier than herself?

Though Wei Tai Zhen didn’t take her Golden Core stage seriously, thinking herself merely an inconspicuous fox spirit, her sensitivity as a Golden Core cultivator was not something ordinary martial artists could compare to. So, it was quite unreasonable; however, as she thought it through, it seemed that the unreasonable was indeed reasonable. Having spent time with Pei Qian and Li Huai, it would be strange if she didn’t find it strange.

Pei Qian told Li Huai, “There are lumberjacks chopping trees at the mountain top. They might not know there are people below. The large trees sliding down could injure those ahead. You all be careful; just hide to the sides.”

Pei Qian first glanced back at the slippery mountain path they had traveled, confirming there was no one before she bent down slightly, pointed her toes, and moved swiftly as thunder, yet soundlessly. She quickly reached within ten paces of the group of scholars, standing sideways, and with a swift motion of her toes, she lifted a rapidly sliding tree trunk that fell behind the scholars, gently shaking her wrist to prevent the trunk from crashing down too heavily, letting it softly land and continue sliding downward. Each subsequent tree trunk that followed was lifted and gently placed by Pei Qian.

When the last tree trunk reached Pei Qian’s side and was lifted by her toes, she leaped backward, standing atop the trunk, and together they dropped onto the mountain path, vanishing in an instant.

That group of scholars, as if they had returned from the gates of hell, stared wide-eyed at one another, utterly dumbfounded.

After surviving the disaster, they felt fortunate, but they were also left completely confused; how did that girl just fly away without even giving them a chance to thank her?

Pei Qian stood atop the tree trunk, sliding down to where Li Huai and Wei Tai Zhen were, gently stepping on the trunk to stop its momentum. Seeing Li Huai and Wei Tai Zhen in a daze, she asked, “Let’s keep moving.”

Pei Qian jumped off the tree trunk and silently said, “Let’s go,” lightly pushing the trunk to continue sliding down the mountain path. Then, she led them to take another climbing path, not wanting to run into that group of scholars.

Li Huai always followed Pei Qian's lead, walking beside her.

Wei Tai Zhen couldn’t help but ask, “Pei, what realm are you at?”

Pei Qian turned her head, smiling, “I’m a long way from my master; I’m currently at the sixth realm.”

---

Atop the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping'an continued his six-step stance, moving extremely slowly and punching slowly.

Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind, and he smiled.

He wondered how his eldest disciple was faring at the fifth realm nowadays.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 816: Unexpected

Chen Ping'an paused his boxing stance and turned to gaze beyond the city walls.

More than a hundred yards away, an unexpected visitor hovered in the air on a sword. It was Fei Ran, the top swordsman of the Bai Jian Immortal Rankings from Tuo Yue Mountain, who preferred to present himself as a blue-clad swordsman.

Fei Ran smiled and said, “Good punches.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Don’t try to steal my moves; have some self-respect.”

Fei Ran was quite similar to that Shou Chen, lacking any demeanor of a true sword cultivator. 

Shaking his head, Fei Ran replied, “I really can’t learn it.”

Previously, he had followed the great demon Qie Yun to the Haoran world, earning a Luohua Island in exchange for military achievements. His choice was somewhat unexpected; otherwise, with his identity, it wouldn’t have been difficult for him to occupy half of the old site of the Yulong Sect. Many in the military speculated that he was after the fabled Creation Cave on Luohua Island, which likely contained hidden treasures that had gone unnoticed by passersby, allowing Fei Ran to pick up a bargain.

Chen Ping'an glanced at Fei Ran before shifting his gaze. Several dozen miles away, a magnificent snowfall was underway, though it was regrettably blocked by the Dragon Lord and could not fall upon the city.

Following the young Hidden Official's gaze, Fei Ran looked at the heavy snow, then turned back with a smile. “When I was young, I studied under Master Zhou and liked to peruse those elegant verses and fairy poems from the Haoran world, imagining their beauty. Unfortunately, Master Zhou has discerning tastes; he often only selected exquisite phrases for his poetry compilations, discarding the rest. Among them, there was a line about snow: ‘With five Ding holding swords to cut through clouds and rain, thirty thousand jade dragons perished in battle.’”

Fei Ran spoke with the refined language characteristic of the Haoran world, engaging the young Hidden Official.

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “The full poem goes: ‘With five Ding holding swords to cut through clouds and rain, aiming straight for the imperial capital beneath the Milky Way. Thirty thousand jade dragons fell in battle, scales scattered by the wind, filling the sky.’ Your old fox from Tongtian only took half of it; that’s not a big deal—his standards aren’t particularly high, just not low.”

Fei Ran nodded. “I see; I’ve learned something.”

Earlier, on the battlefield, Chen Ping'an had sparred with Fei Ran, testing both their wits and strength, though there was no clear victor. Moreover, neither side had truly engaged in a life-or-death struggle, as each still had plenty of hidden cards to play.

In Chen Ping'an's eyes, figures like Fei Ran and Shou Chen represented the greatest potential threat to the Haoran world—not merely because of their proficiency in battlefield combat. After experiencing the recent war, Chen Ping'an genuinely understood a principle: while sword immortals wield tremendous killing power and great demons have high-level techniques, they remain ultimately insignificant in the face of overwhelming forces.

As long as Fei Ran and Shou Chen were willing to invest effort, they could help the various military factions and powerful demons of the wild lands to patch up their weaknesses. They might even succeed in changing customs and immigration patterns, effectively reshaping the territories of the Haoran world that had been encroached upon by the demon clan, thereby altering the heavens and the earth in a deeper sense. Currently, Chen Ping'an’s greatest concern was how the military factions were researching and planning the specifics of the southern advance of the Great Li cavalry from Baoping Continent—how to stitch together the fractured mountains and rivers and win over people’s hearts, only to later replicate these strategies in Tongye Continent or Fuyou Continent.

Just like that Jia Shen military camp, it wasn’t some sword cultivator in wooden clogs, yet it still stirred greater bloodlust in Chen Ping'an than several sword immortals like Li Zhen and Liu Bai combined. 

The low-ranking wooden clogs had once ascended the city wall, standing beside the Dragon Lord, seeking to review the entire battle situation with the Hidden Official, humbly seeking guidance and showing respect as a junior, but Chen Ping'an ignored him. 

With the Dragon Lord present, any intentions of violence were futile; thus, there was no point in chatting. Speaking too much could lead to disaster, especially since the wooden clogs had no aspirations for longevity in cultivation.

Fei Ran twirled the tip of his sword, as if merely accompanying the young Hidden Official to enjoy the snow scene.

Chen Ping'an spoke up. “That Master Zhou, whom you people in the wild lands regard as a literary ocean, just seems to have had some bad luck, sharing the same name with the head of a certain academy in Beiju Luzhou. I’ve heard that Confucian sage has quite a temper. You should tell Liu Bai to be careful; if Zhou Wenhai gets beaten to death by Zhou Shengren, it would surely become an eternal joke.”

Fei Ran was both amused and exasperated, shaking his head. “Looks like Li Zhen was right; you are a bit bored.”

A Confucian academy head killing the second highest-ranking literary figure? Of course, now it was the third, as Xiao Xian had unilaterally decided to place a chair made from the corpse of a great demon that had ascended from the bottom of a well at the second highest position in the ancient well. However, neither Master Zhou nor Liu Cha minded this matter.

Chen Ping'an walked slowly, no longer practicing his boxing stance, and Fei Ran followed on his sword, their paths diverging yet heading in the same direction.

Chen Ping'an casually asked, “What’s the true form of that Tongtian old fox? There’s no record of it in the summer palace archives, and I’ve never had the chance to ask the Great Sword Immortal.”

Although Zhou Mi was known as the Tongtian old fox in the wild lands, Chen Ping'an was sure that the second highest-ranking great demon would not be any kind of celestial fox.

Zhou Mi was far too much like a scholar. Therefore, Chen Ping'an had always wanted to ask about his true name, but so many things came up that he never got the chance.

Fei Ran replied, “It’s a secret of the respected one.”

Chen Ping'an countered, “I didn’t ask for Zhou Mi’s true name.”

Fei Ran said, “Master Zhou definitely has a true name and surname that he has abandoned, but there’s no real name.”

Chen Ping'an responded, “I see; I’ve learned something.”

Of course, it was possible that the other side was just talking nonsense; after all, if Fei Ran wasn’t bored, he wouldn’t have come to hang out here.

Chen Ping'an inquired, “Has that Zhang Lu gone to Fuyou Continent to seek a sword?”

Fuyou Continent had a well-established sword sect, small in numbers but formidable in strength, with no one in history having gone to the Sword Qi Great Wall for training.

Fei Ran shook his head. “Zhang Lu has remained by the ruins of the Great Gate, spending his days napping with a sword in his arms. His choices aren’t quite the same as those of sword immortals like Xiao Xian and Luo Shan Zhuan.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “That’s good to hear.”

Otherwise, he would feel sorry for the wine he had sent out.

Fei Ran smiled. “The Dragon Lord and Tuo Yue Mountain won’t give you the chance to reach the limits of a martial artist or the realm of jade purity at once. I suspect that when you approach the late stage of the mountain peak realm or reach a bottleneck in the nascent soul realm, the Dragon Lord will call for a senior of comparable realm—either Liu Cha or that old ape—to come and hammer away at your city gate, aiming to break your physique and sword heart. In any case, they won’t let you break through too easily, and they will prevent you from losing your mind and abandoning half of the Sword Qi Great Wall to flee to the wild lands. So, you’re destined not to go to the Ten Thousand Great Mountains with that old blind man.”

“You don’t need to guess; Li Zhen must have told Jia Zi’s camp that. I’m just curious—what enmity do I have with him that he clings to me so? If Li Zhen has that brain, wouldn’t it be better to focus on practicing swordsmanship and then face me heroically in a duel?” 

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands behind his head, gazing slightly upwards at the sky. “As for reaching the tenth stage of martial arts, forget it; who would dare to indulge in such desires? You know very well how I reached the mountain peak realm. Besides, I’ve already received two portions of martial luck from your wild lands. As an outsider visiting here, I’ve felt uncomfortable all along, wishing I could return, but that’s impossible. Fei Ran, you’re so famous in the wild lands; don’t you have a few friends in the mountain peak realm? Watching me frolic here, can you endure it? If it were me, I really couldn’t stand it. I’d come to the city walls and at least shout a few words.”

Fei Ran chuckled. “I really don’t have friends in the ninth stage, but I do have one in the tenth stage. However, he’s gone to Fuyou Continent. There’s a tough battle to be fought over at the Shanshui Cave, where Qi Ting Ji and the Zhou God from the Central Plains are stationed. It seems there are also two acquaintances of our Hidden Official there, fellow martial artists of the same age, Cao Ci and Yu Jianfu.”

This young Hidden Official, perhaps in order to practice his punches, had not brought along that long-neglected sword, but the hairpin in his hair made it hard to overlook.

Because even the Dragon Lord couldn’t completely destroy it, just like the bright red robe of Chen Ping'an, it seemed to be a vital object refined from his own essence.

Chen Ping'an shifted into a posture with both hands behind his back. “Cao Ci, has he reached the ninth stage already?”

Fei Ran chuckled. “I don’t know. I haven’t been involved much with the battlefront in Fuyou Continent.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. The mountains and rivers of Fuyou Continent were constantly at war; in a generally peaceful world, it might seem less stable than the stagnant waters of Tongye Continent, but during chaotic times, people’s hearts were far more secure than in Tongye Continent.

Fei Ran took out a flask of Rain Dragon Sect’s celestial wine and raised it towards the young Hidden Official.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, indicating for Fei Ran to drink by himself. Then he shook his sleeve, which was empty. The unique sleeve world technique possessed by fifth stage cultivators was something Chen Ping'an only had a superficial understanding of. The summer palace archives had some rough records, and since Chen Ping'an had little to do, time flowed too slowly for him, leading him to ponder it earnestly. He had managed to form a rough shape, but unfortunately, since he was on the city wall, he had no way to place anything inside. Otherwise, he could even store living things in it. Thus, the sleeve world technique, along with the technique of observing mountains and rivers, had been two of Chen Ping'an’s long-time aspirations in cultivation.

Earlier, during the heavy snowfall, Chen Ping'an had gathered quite a bit of the snow in his sleeve, feeling a bit joyful like having dumplings during the New Year. However, when he finished building a line of snowmen on the city wall, he didn’t expect that because he was too close to the Dragon Lord, a sword light from his gray robe completely shattered them. It would have been fine if the Dragon Lord hadn’t come at that moment; after all, Chen Ping'an had finished using up all the snow just as the Dragon Lord’s sword arrived.

That old bastard better not fall into my hands; otherwise, I would refine and kill all souls and then give them to Shi Rou to wear, so they could accompany Du Mao’s remnants.

Chen Ping'an raised his palm, and lightning crackled as five bolts clustered together in his palm, the patterns resembling mountains and rivers. He smiled. “If you don’t leave soon, I’ll have to send you off. This hairpin of mine has no hidden motives; you can rest assured and let Jia Zi know that.”

Fei Ran hesitated for a moment before nodding. “I’ll help you pass on the message then.”

With a smile, Chen Ping'an declared, “Then, off you go.” He threw a bolt of lightning magic towards Fei Ran.

Fei Ran merely dodged without drawing his sword.

I have sincere intentions of gifting wine, and you send me off with lightning magic—what a delightful exchange of courtesy!

Fei Ran, still in a good mood, bid farewell to the young Hidden Official, slowly soaring away on his sword. Fei Ran was known for his leisurely demeanor.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an turned to Fei Ran and asked, “In that carefully selected poetry collection by Zhou Mi, have you ever encountered a well-known fairy poem? Generally, it should be placed at the beginning or the end.”

Fei Ran halted, smiling. “I’d love to hear more.”

Chen Ping'an, hands tucked in his sleeves, walked slowly while loudly reciting the fairy poem.

“I dwell in a timeless abode of humanity, with the sun rising high in the east wall. Upon waking, I find my dreams disturbed, commanding the bright moon to fall within. I beckon a cloud at the edge of heaven, always accompanied by pines by the stream in my sleeve. 

Drunk, I ride a white deer, driving a green dragon, while the immortals meet me to seek fine wine. I hang my crown upon the branches of the heavenly palace, grasping the golden crow as a charcoal basket. 

Alas, the immortal’s dream spans a thousand autumns; one dream leads me to mistake longevity.”

After hearing it, Fei Ran’s expression was peculiar.

Chen Ping'an turned his head, his gaze sincere. “What are you dawdling for? If you haven’t heard it, memorize it quickly! Later, let Zhou Wenhai cleanse himself and then properly transcribe it as a masterpiece of fairy poetry in the world.”

Fei Ran chuckled. “Isn’t this tone a bit too casual? Hidden Official, please don’t bully me for not being a scholar.”

Chen Ping'an feigned regret. “The Haoran world has a long history, with so many refined languages, official dialects, and local tongues. What do you know about tones, rhymes, and the four tones? A poem’s spirit is like the intention of a punch; the greater the meaning, the more imposing it is, striking down like a hammer. Future scholars, upon seeing poetry, should feel as though they’ve been dealt a heavy blow.”

Fei Ran smiled slightly.

Chen Ping'an nodded, raising his hand and gently shaking it. “Looks like Brother Fei Ran still has some knowledge. You’re right; there are collections of couplets and poems in the world. My fairy poem, like the lightning in my palm, is clustered together.”

Fei Ran soared away on his sword.

Chen Ping'an leaned against the city wall, continuing to peruse the travelogue he had thrown out earlier, quickly regretting it and hurriedly using the Earth and Sky technique to return to a stroke of the large character within the wall, retrieving the book that had been drifting in the wind. He had read through the entire book and could recite it effortlessly; Chen Ping'an had no issues with that.

Since the objects within arm’s reach belonged to the outer world of this half Sword Qi Great Wall, as long as Chen Ping'an dared to take them out, even if he was at the farthest end of the city wall from the Dragon Lord, he would still attract a sword strike. Therefore, Chen Ping'an had no paper or brush; he could only make annotations on the book using fine sword Qi as a pen, lightly “writing” on the blank pages. Even without the cultivation of jade purity, with Chen Ping'an’s keen eyesight, the characters were still quite legible.

Every time he turned a page, he would change his reading location—either sitting among the strokes of the character on the city wall, walking along the wall, hanging upside down along the parapet, or suddenly riding the wind to the sky above the city wall. However, the current sky was not high, only about five hundred yards above the city wall. Any further up, after a sword strike from the Dragon Lord, the residual sword Qi could truly harm Chen Ping'an’s physique.

For some reason, the Dragon Lord showed no interest in this book, which was also an external item like the objects at hand, allowing Chen Ping'an to read freely without any sword light coming his way.

Chen Ping'an then found a small space in the shell of a snail to quietly do a little thing, carefully refining each character from the book to the outside, taking great care to refine every word before collecting them into his sleeve. As a result, when Chen Ping'an came to read this book again, it had already had over two thousand commonly used characters stripped away, making the content on the pages largely blank and fragmented, as if the little characters forced to move had been dragged away by Chen Ping'an by their collars, crying and whining, being reluctantly taken far from their homeland.

Some rare characters that appeared alone often appeared in pairs, temporarily not being forced to move.

It was a pity that he hadn’t managed to form a hundred family surnames or compile a thousand-character essay.

This small-scale character refining had, of course, no practical use.

Even if he refined the thirty thousand characters of the entire travelogue, resulting in all the pages turning blank, it would only mean that the sleeve world had collected more lifeless little characters. Ultimately, Chen Ping'an could never learn from Pei Qian and Li Huai to speak of commanding thirty thousand soldiers.

However, if he truly became unbearably bored, Chen Ping'an would arrange those little refined characters, shake them out of his sleeve, and scatter them on the city wall, dividing them into two camps, with not many characters—each time, only twenty or thirty at most, and all being commonly used words that often appeared in the travelogue, so as not to be wiped out by the Dragon Lord’s sword if he suddenly lost his mind.

Chen Ping'an would let those little characters, like those dressed in black, land on the city wall, swaying about, their footsteps slow, like two groups of unruly children in the streets, engaged in a playful tussle, lacking any strength.

Today, Chen Ping'an suddenly became extremely diligent with his character refining, refining hundreds of the “Chen Ping'an” characters, converting one for every fifteen hundred refined.

Then, Chen Ping'an carefully shook out two characters from his sleeve.

After issuing commands to those “Chen Ping'an” characters, they clustered together closely, standing shoulder to shoulder, forming a single “Chen Ping'an.”

Thus, there were two characters: one was Ning, and the other was Yao.

It was Ning Yao.

It seemed she alone was facing off against those unfortunate “Chen Ping'an” characters that weren’t his.

Then, “Ning Yao” stepped forward, and five hundred “Chen Ping'an” characters began to wobble, ultimately falling over like drunken men, crashing to the ground.

Chen Ping'an squatted on the city wall, hands tucked in his sleeves, watching this scene with a radiant smile.

A bright red robe spread across the ground.

Today, the young Hidden Official did not feel too lonely.

It was also the first time he didn’t feel the passage of time dragging on painfully slowly.

From the other half of the city wall, the Dragon Lord unleashed a sword, and this time, it was not a mere warning strike; its momentum was immense.

Even as that sword light swept past him, it covered several dozen miles in an instant.

The sword intent was intense, the sword Qi long, stretching from the cliffside where the Dragon Lord unleashed his sword, spreading in a straight line.

Chen Ping'an remained seemingly unaware.

As the sword light traversed half the distance across the city wall, Chen Ping'an stood up and began to confront it with his boxing skills as a ninth-stage martial artist.

Time and again, his form dissipated, only to reconstitute before the sword light aimed at those little characters, launching his punches again.

Finally, Chen Ping'an, as a mountain peak martial artist, shattered that sword light with his fists, arriving at the cliffside, his feet stamping heavily on the ground, manifesting a sword immortal form as tall as a mountain, condensing the spiritual energy of the four directions into a sword. With both hands holding the sword, he struck down towards the gray-robed figure at the cliff’s edge.

With golden, cat-like eyes, the colossal form bellowed, “To enhance my punching intent, I must thank the Dragon Lord!”

The Dragon Lord waved his hand, pushing the young woman who was nurturing her sword intent and stabilizing her sword heart more than a hundred yards away, edging her closer to the cliff’s edge, leaving no sign of the sword being unleashed.

The sword in the hand of that form on the opposite cliff shattered, causing the form to collapse with a loud crash.

The sword immortal form reappeared, and the long sword slashed down towards the Dragon Lord.

For an entire incense stick’s worth of time, the Dragon Lord remained motionless, and the form’s long sword could not even approach the gray robe.

Countless sword Qi from the heavens and earth battled against the young man.

After the last form shattered, Chen Ping'an finally ceased his meaningless sword strikes, vanishing in an instant, returning to his original position and gathering those small refined characters.

Liu Bai, feeling anxious, approached the Dragon Lord’s side and whispered, “Did he truly enhance his punching intent?”

The difference between a mountain peak martial artist and a tenth-stage martial artist was like that between the great sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall—Nalan Shao Yi, Yue Qing, and Mi Hu—and those old sword immortals of the ascension realm.

“He was speaking to the demon cultivators under his feet; he didn’t enhance his punching intent even a bit. It’s just nonsense meant to annoy me.” 

The Dragon Lord sighed, feeling helpless as he explained patiently to the girl beside him, who was actually quite clever but always became muddled when it came to Chen Ping'an. “At this height of martial arts in the mountain peak realm, martial artists’ mental states wouldn’t be too poor, especially this mad dog who loves to ask himself questions. If I were to strike and ruin his good fortune, his anger and frustration would be real, but it would be very difficult for his martial spirit to rise any higher. It’s not that easy to make significant progress. Having served as a Hidden Official and witnessed those grand battle scenes firsthand, this is already a cage for his martial arts. It’s hard to have significant joys or sorrows anymore. So, his path is actually very close to the end of the martial artist’s road, where only life-and-death battles can forcefully sharpen his physique.”

Liu Bai lightly nodded, agreeing deeply.

The bright red robe suddenly reappeared at the cliff’s edge, this time carrying the narrow blade, with both hands gently resting on the hilt, smiling. “Liu Bai, do you think our esteemed Dragon Lord enjoys talking? Since he doesn’t, why is he so chatty? There must be profound meaning in it; you should ponder it well. Practicing sword without cultivating the heart will lead to a fall in realm.”

Liu Bai scoffed. “You’re not chatty at all.”

Chen Ping'an, with a serious expression, replied, “Isn’t it because I’m afraid Liu Bai, upon hearing the Dragon Lord’s convoluted explanations, would be all ‘oh, oh, oh,’ with a look of ‘hmm, hmm, hmm,’ while secretly cursing that old thief Dragon Lord in her heart?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “As for the gods on the mountain, as long as there’s some doubt, when speculating together, dark ghosts are born. I’m helping our esteemed Dragon Lord clear his name; can’t you see that? Liu Bai, I’m not saying you; if we were to engage in literary duels, I’d worry you’d end up banging your head against the wall or breaking your neck. Even the Dragon Lord wouldn’t be able to stop it. Today, the Dragon Lord has helped me enhance my punching intent; give me some face and don’t go gossiping with Brother Zhou Mi.”

Liu Bai’s eyes gradually hardened, and she unexpectedly stepped forward, crossing over the gray robe. She smiled and said, “No matter what you say or do, whether your words oppose your true thoughts or not, I won’t hold it against you. You don’t need to thank the Dragon Lord for helping you enhance your punching intent; whether you genuinely thank him or not is irrelevant. However, I must thank you for helping me mend my sword heart, sincerely!”

The Dragon Lord nodded lightly; it was about time.

Chen Ping'an fell silent for a moment.

In fact, Liu Bai having such intentions was correct.

But was it useful?

It might not be useful for her, but for Chen Ping'an himself, it was indeed somewhat beneficial.

Chen Ping'an smiled. “Do you know that a new demon of the heart has arisen because of me? My sword heart has been repaired a bit, which has given rise to a new demon—one with even fewer flaws. Whether you believe this or not, ask the Dragon Lord if you like; it's up to you.”

The Dragon Lord sighed. “Liu Bai, go practice your sword elsewhere. He’s observing your understanding of heart demons.”

No wonder this person, who clearly didn’t see Liu Bai as an opponent, intentionally came here time and again, leaving traces of thought in her heart.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the gray robe. So many high-ranking demons were present, yet it was the Dragon Lord who remained on the city wall.

The Dragon Lord laughed. “Is the mad dog about to bite someone?”

Liu Bai had already left in disappointment, not using her sword, walking atop the city wall.

Chen Ping'an unexpectedly sat at the cliff’s edge, overlooking the distant tide of the demon army below, then withdrew his gaze, leaning back, using the narrow blade as a pillow, and muttered to himself, “Home should be where the children pull at my clothes, laughing at my white hair.”

The Dragon Lord chuckled. “I don’t have such sorrows; you are even less able to return home.”

Chen Ping'an exclaimed, surprised. “How do you understand human speech?”

The Dragon Lord casually replied, “Do you know why this view isn’t obstructed?”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “It’s similar to those two heavy snowfalls; it’s easy to fall into extravagance from frugality, but difficult to revert from extravagance to frugality. In fact, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

The Dragon Lord laughed heartily. “Keep waiting; at most, six months from now, not only will you see neither sun nor moon, but soon, I won’t even need to obstruct your punches or sword strikes. In this case, you’re faring worse than Chen Qing.”

It turned out that Chen Ping'an could no longer see the Dragon Lord’s gray robe. In fact, all sights on the opposite city wall had vanished from his view.

Looking down again, the tide of demons rushing towards the Haoran world was also invisible.

Chen Ping'an turned his head to gaze at the distant snowflakes slowly falling, still faintly visible.

Even if he couldn’t see them in the future, what difference would it make?

Small worries, like grains of rice.

Moreover, the rivers and lakes meet, boasting of hardships, and the rivers and lakes are vast; there will certainly be a time to meet again. Someone will surely say, “Master, you’ve worked hard.” “Sir, you’ve worked hard.” “Little Uncle Master, you’ve worked hard.” “Chen Ping'an, you’ve worked hard.”

Chen Ping'an waved his sleeves, laughing loudly, “What’s the fuss about? It’s nothing to fuss over!”

Fei Ran and Li Zhen arrived beside the Dragon Lord, with Li Zhen asking, “Is he truly insane?”

The Dragon Lord countered, “Ask yourself.”

Fei Ran laughed and queried, “That Cao Ci, can he really win against him three times in a row?”

The Dragon Lord nodded. “Indeed.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 817: The Question of Fists (Part 1)**

The group traversed the southeastern regions of North Julu Continent, passing by the Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain, a rare pair of Daoist companion peaks.

Golden Light Peak was occasionally graced by the ethereal Golden-Backed Goose, though its tracks were notoriously elusive. For cultivators hoping to capture it, the task was more than challenging. Conversely, Moonlight Mountain was known for its giant snow-white frog, as large as a mountain, which would appear on full moon nights during the first and fifteenth days of each month, often accompanied by a swarm of disciples eager to absorb its moon essence. This earned it the nickname "Thunder Mountain."

As the three of them made their way, they deliberately avoided the immortal crossing and opted to traverse the rugged terrain on foot. Li Huai seemed in no hurry to reach Lion Peak, and Pei Qian was equally unhurried to return to Baoping Continent. 

In private, Li Huai had mentioned that Pei Qian wanted to see her master by the time she returned home. 

Li Huai himself was not averse to arriving earlier at the foot of Lion Peak to see his parents; however, whenever he thought about Pei Qian's situation, he could not bring himself to urge her on. 

Beyond his reluctance, there was an element of fear. Pei Qian was not like Li Baoping; the latter would at least punch with reason. Li Huai was all too aware that Pei Qian had plenty of little ledgers tucked away—rumor had it that nearly everyone had one of their own. He suspected that his own ledger could very well be the thickest among them.

Wei Taizhen did not mind the slow pace, but as time passed, the peculiarities continued to mount. 

For instance, Pei Qian had chosen a dark and cloudy day to ascend Golden Light Peak, surrounded by towering, eerie stones. It was as if she had come not to seek the elusive Golden-Backed Goose but rather to enjoy the mountain scenery while deliberately avoiding the proud and fierce geese. This was not too strange, but what was odd was that after reaching the summit and camping overnight, Pei Qian began practicing her stances and fist techniques. She had purchased two inexpensive books in the market at Bone Marsh: "Relaxed Collection" by the Pima Sect and "Spring Dew in Winter" from the Spring Dew Garden. Pei Qian frequently flipped through them, always landing on a passage from "Spring Dew Garden" that described Jade Shadow Cliff and two young sword immortals, which brought her a smile. It was as if, during her low moments, merely reading that short passage could ease her worries.

Pei Qian would also ask Li Huai questions about her studies, forcing him to muster the courage to help her with answers. Unfortunately, every time she received an answer copied directly from the classics, she was never quite satisfied.

Wei Taizhen was convinced they would return empty-handed, having seen no sign of the Golden-Backed Goose. After all, such spiritual birds only appeared under the sun's rays once every hundred years.

Unexpectedly, as night fell, Wei Taizhen had Li Huai light a bonfire in a spot she deemed suitable for pretending to be an immortal refining energy. With nothing better to do, he poked at the dry branches and casually remarked that a caged bird cannot be held, as the sun is their feather.

Moments later, the dark sea of clouds seemed to part, revealing a golden light that grew increasingly brilliant, dragging a golden thread behind it, seemingly headed straight for Wei Taizhen's location on Golden Light Peak.

As the nominal Golden Core Immortal of Lion Peak and a senior sister to her master, Wei Taizhen had traveled here with Li Liu years ago as a close servant. 

Being a mountain spirit born and raised in the region of Baojing Mountain, Wei Taizhen had already achieved a considerable form; advancing any further was a luxury. However, after meeting her master, she had progressed almost one realm per year until she reached the Golden Core stage. Her master advised her to take a break, saying that breaking through the Golden Core bottleneck to reach the Nascent Soul stage would attract heavenly tribulations, and he would help fend them off. There was no issue with that, but with eight tails, her appearance and demeanor had become increasingly alluring, making her role as a maidservant—serving tea and water—potentially distracting for her brother, who was studying.

Having seen much of the world alongside her master Li Liu, she had encountered countless peculiar situations. Just saying that the Fishing Immortal at the Resting Dragon Stone was a "palace steward of the Jade Purity realm" was enough to make her chuckle. Moreover, the great demon residing over the Ascension Pit was merely a former summer retreat of her master, which had turned into a space akin to her own identity—an elegantly dressed woman compared to her little Golden Core. In casual conversation, there seemed to be an undertone of flattery, not to mention the lord of White Emperor City in the Central Continent...

Thus, Wei Taizhen was not intimidated by a Golden-Backed Goose of lesser cultivation. Before her master appeared at Bone Marsh, he had already gifted her one offensive and one defensive treasure. In his words, as long as she used them properly, she could exchange lives with any Nascent Soul cultivator outside of sword cultivators. However, was her master's brother's tongue a bit too...? Other mountain immortals had to wait years to achieve what they sought, yet Li Huai's nonsensical remark could summon a Golden-Backed Goose?

Pei Qian suddenly woke from her sleep, sensing the anomaly even before Wei Taizhen. She quickly secured her bamboo box, took her hiking staff, and glanced at the imposing Golden-Backed Goose. Immediately, she urged Wei Xianzi to help her take Li Huai away, saying, "We’ve intruded on their territory. It wouldn’t be right to fight them here. Let’s move quickly to give them some space."

Wei Taizhen dared not defy Pei Qian and hurriedly used her wind magic to carry Li Huai away from Golden Light Peak. As for Pei Qian, she decisively retreated a dozen or so zhang, facing the cliff and sprinting forward, leaping high to jump off the edge.

Wei Taizhen looked down at the rapidly descending figure, noting that Pei Qian was a six-realm martial artist, neither a Golden Body nor a Wanderer's stage cultivator. Would she be alright?

Pei Qian's leap covered an impressive distance of fifty to sixty zhang. At first glance, she certainly resembled a master of the Wanderer realm.

However, during her descent toward the ground, Pei Qian suddenly felt annoyed at her reckless actions. She remembered her master’s teachings: the first rule of wandering the world is, "Before asking about fists, first drop two realms." Thus, she felt embarrassed by her current situation as a martial artist at a bottleneck. She should have been careful, acting like a four-realm martial artist, and only revealing her five-realm prowess in "dangerous moments." In this manner, if she ever had to confront someone about their fists, she would have had a clear advantage.

Therefore, Pei Qian decided to take a last-minute precaution, deliberately making her breathing a bit erratic, flailing her arms and legs. Fearing she might damage the bamboo box strapped to her back, she ultimately crashed into the ground face-first at the foot of Moonlight Mountain, creating a large cloud of dust.

"Ouch!" she exclaimed, hopping around as she sprained her ankle.

In truth, Pei Qian felt a twinge of guilt for her clumsy antics. If her master had been nearby, she would surely have been scolded.

Li Huai, with tightly closed eyes and a back soaked in sweat, was not particularly enjoying the feeling of drifting through the clouds.

Half a joss stick later, Wei Taizhen gently lowered Li Huai to the ground. Pei Qian, regaining her composure, swiftly climbed to a high branch of an ancient tree near Moonlight Mountain, her expression serious as she gazed toward Golden Light Peak. She let out a sigh of relief and lowered her head to say to Li Huai and the others, "It’s alright now. Their temper seems quite good; they didn’t pursue us."

At the peak of Golden Light, the Golden-Backed Goose landed gracefully. In a flash of golden light, it transformed into a young woman with a graceful figure, seemingly adorned in a golden feathered robe. She wore a somewhat mournful expression. What was going on? In her haste to return home and host her guests, she had deliberately concealed her Golden Core aura and had no intention of hostility. Little did she expect that the group would just run away. In North Julu, there had never been a case of a Golden-Backed Goose attacking unprovoked.

After landing, Li Huai swayed for a moment, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he felt a wave of fear wash over him. "I’ll never be an immortal again; I swear I won’t! Flying here and there, it's so unstable to be human."

Pei Qian glared at Li Huai, reminding him that Wei Xianzi was still present. 

Li Huai quickly apologized. Wei Taizhen, feeling a bit flustered herself, could only say it was fine.

Though Pei Qian adhered strictly to her master’s rules of not "looking too closely" at those close to her, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this gentle Wei Xianzi was a bit odd. The authenticity of her Golden Core realm might be true, but her real identity was still uncertain. However, since this was Li Huai’s family matter, and Wei Taizhen was brought to Li Huai by Li Liu, Pei Qian decided not to meddle further. After all, her dense-headed companion, Li Huai, had his own good fortune.

After passing Golden Light Peak and heading toward Moonlight Mountain, Pei Qian didn’t dare venture up. On a moonlit night, while miles away from Thunder Mountain, she was unsurprised to hear a cacophony of drum frogs filling the mountain as they bellowed toward the bright moon.

Pei Qian carefully observed that Moonlight Mountain itself seemed like a treasure trove for gathering moonlight, with strands of moon essence cascading down, swallowed by the drum frogs.

That night, amidst the beautiful scenery, Pei Qian felt that nothing could compare to home.

Li Huai quietly asked, "In the wild world, do three moons truly exist?"

Pei Qian nodded. "Yes, three gigantic mooncakes hang high in the sky, much like the pastries made by Sister Xiu Xiu. They look quite appetizing."

Pei Qian took out a booklet, sketching a section titled "Drum Frogs of Moonlight Mountain," with Golden-Backed Goose from Golden Light Peak above it, and below that, the Fire God Temple of Sui Jia City from Silver Screen Country. Further down were mentions of various places like Huai Huang Country's Flapping Fly Wine, Yu Hu County's Golden Bell Temple, Baoxiang Country's Yellow Wind Valley's Mute Lake, and the Ghostly Axe Palace of the martial families, among others.

Li Huai leaned over to take a glance, and Pei Qian didn’t stop him from peeking. He asked, "Looks like we aren't far from Little Grain's hometown?"

Pei Qian closed the book and returned it to her box, nodding. "Not far at all."

Li Huai asked, "Is Flapping Fly Wine an immortal wine? Should we buy a jar to take back, or give it as a gift?"

Pei Qian chuckled. "It’s not some immortal brew; it’s a drink my master had years ago with a great figure at a tavern in the marketplace. It’s not expensive, and I can buy several jars."

Her master once mentioned that the great figure's long-term strategy regarding worldly merits had given him deeper insights.

At the entrance of a heavenly cave on Moonlight Mountain, a chubby boy dressed in white asked with a smile, "Sister Jin Feng, is this the group of ignorant fellows? One of them seems to have a cultivation level comparable to ours, and their aura is well-concealed. But they look a bit too fox-like, and despite their aura being quite righteous, they don’t seem like ordinary fox spirits refining their forms down below. Could they be a true fox immortal from a Daoist sect?"

The girl from Golden Light Peak replied irritably, "If you’re interested in that fox-like girl, Yu Lu, why not go and test the waters?"

The boy, referred to as "Yu Lu," shook his head. "Those mountain cultivators have many tricks up their sleeves. If they’re trying to lure me out, it might be to sever my ties to the mountain root and seize Moonlight Mountain as their scenic retreat. Unlike you, Sister Jin Feng, who has little to worry about, I have many descendants on the mountain to care for. Otherwise, it would be too tragic for them to end up in the fox country of Baoping Continent."

The girl hesitated.

The chubby boy, who was the ancient ancestor of the drum frogs, chuckled, "Sister Jin Feng, are you feeling a bit love-struck?"

The girl frowned. "I just felt a sudden surge of Daoist heart, as if a chance for breakthrough had arrived. But I’m not confident; I’m worried about the temperament of those mountain people. Like you, I’m extremely cautious."

The boy replied seriously, "Jin Feng, may I protect your path for a while? Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain are mutual companion peaks. Since we are both here to pursue the Dao, if you can break through, remember to help protect my path in return. No need for any swearing oaths; I don’t believe in such things. We both know each other’s temperament well enough."

The young woman gritted her teeth. "Alright, let's gamble on it!"

The boy suddenly looked astonished, then with a hint of guilt, he backtracked. "Sister Jin Feng, never mind. I wouldn’t dare leave the mountain now."

Jin Feng asked, "What’s wrong?"

Yu Lu pointed to his eyes, then tapped his ears with his fingers, smiling wryly. "That group is ultimately still within the territory of Moonlight Mountain. I had that 'not-so-landlord-like' frog eavesdropping on their conversations, and what I didn’t expect was for that girl to catch sight of me three times. Once could be a coincidence, twice a reminder; but three times surely counts as a threat, right? The Golden Core woman didn’t notice, but a simple martial artist did? Isn’t that too strange? Can I afford to provoke them?"

Jin Feng understood Yu Lu's cautious nature and didn’t press him. She nodded. "I’ll give up on the chance then; I’ll focus on my cultivation instead."

However, Yu Lu changed his mind. "Perhaps I could still give it a try."

Jin Feng sighed. "Yu Lu, what’s going on with you?"

The boy rubbed his cheeks vigorously. "Sister Jin Feng, trust me just this once!"

Pei Qian cupped her fists in a certain direction before continuing on their journey.

Li Huai curiously asked, "What’s that?"

Pei Qian softly replied, "Three sticks of incense before entering the temple to pay respects at the mountain peak; it’s a custom."

Li Huai, wanting to imitate Pei Qian, raised his hands, only to receive a whack from her hiking staff. "If your heart isn’t sincere, then don’t do anything at all. Don’t you know it’s easy to invite a deity but hard to send them off?"

Li Huai nodded, realizing the truth in her words.

The group then passed through Silver Screen Country, skirting around the recently renovated Cangjun Lake, which had recently closed its doors to guests.

The lord of Cangjun Lake, Lord Yin, was the chief water deity of the nation, overseeing one lake and three rivers, along with two creek channels. According to the locals who burned incense at various temples, for some unknown reason, several river gods and water spirits had been replaced in recent years.

Li Huai asked Pei Qian why they hadn’t gone to burn incense at the major water deity temples. Pei Qian didn’t state a reason, only saying they would first visit the city of Sui Jia, which had recently replaced its city god.

Arriving at the county city just before nightfall, Pei Qian asked for directions and headed straight to the recently rebuilt Fire God Temple, which had undergone repairs not long ago.

As night fell, just as the temple priest was about to close the doors, a man stepped out from the golden statue of the deity and approached the entrance, telling the old priest to take care of his own business.

At the temple entrance, the man looked at the two travelers, each holding a hiking staff and carrying a bamboo box, and bluntly asked, "I’m a minor deity of this place; do you know Chen Ping'an?"

Li Huai was taken aback, greatly impressed by the man’s foresight.

Pei Qian cupped her fists and smiled, "I’m my master’s eldest disciple, Pei Qian. It’s a pleasure to meet the old lord of the Fire God Temple!"

The man nodded with a smile. "Can you drink?"

Pei Qian blushed and shook her head. "My master doesn’t allow it."

The man laughed. "No matter; I’ll have the temple priest prepare a feast. You’ll stay here tonight. Thanks to your master’s influence, this little temple has grown quite large. We’ve built several guesthouses; you’re welcome to stay."

Pei Qian cupped her fists again, saying, "Then I’ll be in your care, old lord of the Fire Temple."

Li Huai followed her lead, cupping his fists, while Wei Taizhen offered a respectful bow.

Since he was a friend of Pei Qian's master, Wei Taizhen felt she must treat this matter seriously.

On the road, Pei Qian and Li Huai had been arguing about one thing: Pei Qian insisted she had already reached the sixth realm, while her master must be at least at the eleventh realm—there was no doubt about it. Li Huai insisted that friendship aside, her master was certainly only at the tenth realm! If they were to bet, and he lost, he would have his sister take on Pei Qian's surname!

Wei Taizhen listened, heart racing. "At least eleventh realm… definitely tenth realm… You want your master to change surnames…"

The man exchanged greetings with the young scholar and the girl dressed in black with a veil. Even though the girl had an impressively high cultivation level, he didn’t care. After all, they all shared the same connection—friends of Chen Ping'an. Whether they were at the fifth realm or lower, they were all friends.

The man then looked at Pei Qian and joked, "You’re certainly more reserved than that Ling Jun brother."

Oh, Chen Lingjun! Out and about, he dared to be so familiar, casually calling himself a brother to the friends of his master.

Pei Qian silently noted a debt against Chen Lingjun.

However, Pei Qian still quietly asked, "Is Chen Lingjun doing well?"

The man nodded. "Very well. He mentioned he was leaving soon to visit Spring Dew Garden. That night, the lord of Cangjun Lake even came to drink with him; your master’s reputation is still substantial. But Ling Jun is quite sensible; you need not worry."

Pei Qian replied, "Chen Lingjun tends to be a bit carefree and may not pay much attention to formalities, so please bear with him, old lord of the Fire Temple."

At the dinner table, Pei Qian inquired about nearby immortal mountains. 

The man shared various anecdotes, stating that ever since your master left, the territories of the ten or so countries had undergone significant changes, with abundant spiritual energy flooding in. Numerous young genius cultivators, including the likes of Yan Qing, had broken through recently. However, for some unknown reason, the lord of Yellow Seal City, Ye Han, and He Lu had completely vanished from the scene, despite their once being a well-known couple among the mountain sects. Many mountain spirits and demons had begun to wander around from afar but so far hadn’t caused any major trouble. The lord of Cangjun Lake had his means, and with the support of many monks from Baoxiang Country, the world remained relatively peaceful. As for Sui Jia City, which had previously attracted heavenly tribulations, no demons dared to cause trouble there anymore. 

At this point, the man took a large gulp of his wine and then asked Pei Qian why her master hadn’t come.

Pei Qian explained that her master was off on another journey but would certainly come to visit and drink in person in the future; he cherished old ties.

The man nodded with a smile.

He noticed the young woman had already lowered her head to eat.

Thus, he did not inquire further.

They spent the night at the Fire God Temple.

In truth, Pei Qian couldn’t sleep at all. She stood in the corridor, lost in thought. Eventually, feeling restless, she decided to sit on the wall and daydream. She wanted to stand on the roof to see the entirety of Sui Jia City, yet that would not be proper etiquette as a guest.

At dawn, after bidding farewell to the temple lord, they continued on their journey to Huai Huang Country's Yu Hu County. Her master had mentioned encountering two young and kind-hearted female heroes there, who had once faced the demons causing chaos at the Golden Bell Temple.

Pei Qian admired them, wondering what kind of exceptional martial skills these heroines must possess to be praised as such by her master.

After visiting the now-thriving Golden Bell Temple, Pei Qian found a tavern at the border of Huai Huang Country and Baoxiang Country, treating Li Huai to a sumptuous meal and buying two jars of Flapping Fly Wine.

Wei Taizhen learned through idle conversations with Pei Qian and Li Huai that her master’s hometown was now named Huai Huang County.

As they approached the Mute Lake of Yellow Wind Valley, Pei Qian’s mood visibly brightened. With Huai Huang County as her hometown, and this place being part of it, Little Grain indeed shared a connection with her master.

On the sandy road, surrounded by the sounds of camel bells, the group moved slowly. Now that the Yellow Wind Valley no longer suffered from the tyranny of a great demon, the only drawback was that the lake's water level remained unchanged, fluctuating only with the weather, losing its mountain gossip.

Pei Qian and her companions rested by the water's edge of Mute Lake. This was Little Grain's old home.

Little Grain and Chen Lingjun were entirely different. Chen Lingjun used to love rambling on about his exploits in the Yu River, but as time passed, he probably grew tired of repeating himself and became less inclined to mention the matters of the Jianghu. Little Grain, however, only shared bits and pieces of her past at Mute Lake with Pei Qian and Nuan Shu in private, recounting how she had once been quite famous in her hometown. A group of powerful immortals from the Peach Branch Country's Qing Qiang Prefecture had made a great fuss to capture her, and among them was a martial artist named Mao Qiulu, a good girl despite being a bit fierce. They had even invited her to be a river mistress in the Qiang Guo, but the national master of that country had only offered a single Gu Yu coin, suggesting he was truly poor. Then, someone from Jinwu Palace, whose name she couldn’t recall, had also tried to buy her, offering only two Gu Yu coins, even though that was a bit stingy for a mountain spirit.

Then, she had crossed paths with a good-hearted mountain lord, who paid a hefty price to buy her from Qing Qiang Prefecture. Thus, she set off with him to wander the Jianghu. It was quite an achievement; they had slain the invincible Yellow Wind Ancestor together. Unfortunately, not many knew about this grand feat. But what did it matter? She was not one to care about fame; she was not that kind of water monster. Whether people knew or not, it didn't matter; after all, the good-hearted mountain lord had promised her that one day, many people would read her story in books…

At that time, Little Grain had just been promoted to the Right Protector of Qilong Alley and had returned to Luopo Mountain with Pei Qian. She had still enjoyed repeating those tales, and while Pei Qian had found Little Grain's repetitive recounting a bit tiresome, she had never stopped her from sharing excitedly. At most, during the second retelling, Pei Qian would extend two fingers, and when it reached the third time, she would raise three fingers, saying, "That's the third time now." The little girl would scratch her head, feeling a bit embarrassed, and after that, Little Grain would stop bringing it up.

That was the first time Nuan Shu had gotten angry, secretly approaching Pei Qian and saying, "You can’t be like this. If Little Grain wants to talk, just let her talk. It doesn’t delay anything for us. Little Grain is so far from home; what’s the harm in hearing her say it a few more times? If you genuinely don’t want to listen, just say you’re going to copy books or practice fists. Even saying you’ve grown tired of hearing it would be better than dismissing Little Grain—how hurtful that is."

At first, Pei Qian didn’t take it seriously and paid little attention. She merely dealt with Nuan Shu, who had never been angry before, saying, "I get it, I get it. I promise I won’t show impatience again. Even if I do, I’ll hide it well. That silly little Grain would never notice." But the next morning, when Pei Qian yawned and prepared to practice her fists in the bamboo tower, she saw that black-clad little girl, who had already taken up her hiking staff, standing at the door to act as her guardian, undeterred by the wind or rain.

Upon seeing Pei Qian, the little girl immediately puffed out her chest, grinning widely, then pursed her lips into a smile.

It was only at that moment that Pei Qian realized her mistake. She patted Little Grain on the head, saying she could talk about Mute Lake whenever she wanted, and they should think carefully to see if there were any stories they had left out.

The little girl had happily followed Pei Qian, shaking her head vigorously, saying she wouldn't bring it up anymore. She had just been afraid that Pei Qian and Nuan Shu would forget and wanted to say it a couple of times. Thinking was hard work.

In the end, Little Grain reminded Pei Qian to let her know if she ever forgot, and she would repeat it for her.

Under the moonlight, Pei Qian cupped her hands to catch water, the bright moon resting in her palms.

At Luopo Mountain, the three of them loved to huddle under the covers, whispering secrets, their heads peeking up like a little hill.

Li Huai sat a short distance away by the bonfire.

Wei Taizhen softly asked, "Young Master Li, why don’t you urge Miss Pei to move a bit faster?"

After all, she was still Li Huai's maid and needed to consider this Young Master a bit.

Li Huai couldn’t stand being called "Young Master Li," but since Wei Xianzi insisted, he could only awkwardly accept it, treating it as if the immortal mountain of Lion Peak were as unassuming as his hometown. He felt a bit happy for his sister; in such a place for cultivation, she shouldn’t be bullied easily. His sister truly had a kind temperament and looked too delicate. After so many years back home, she hadn’t even learned to argue, which was a bit foolish, just like their father. Unlike himself, who had inherited his mother’s temper, it wasn’t easy for him to be bullied when out and about.

Upon hearing this, Li Huai chuckled. "There’s no hurry; we’ve already seen my sister, and Lion Peak doesn’t have legs. Besides, Pei Qian promised me she would stay at Lion Peak for a while."

Previously, Wei Taizhen had been in the town of Naihe Pass without stepping inside her home, and she nodded softly. While she had to ask questions, she couldn’t say too much, lest she be accused of stirring trouble.

After leaving Mute Lake, Pei Qian brought Li Huai to Ghostly Axe Palace. Her master had mentioned a fellow named Du Yu there, who had a good habit of sparring and sharing techniques.

Unfortunately, Du Yu was away, as Ghostly Axe Palace was both a home and a school. According to the disciples of the mountain gate, Young Master Du was often traveling.

The Ghostly Axe Palace disciple was unsure of the trio’s backgrounds and cultivation levels. He thought that since they were familiar with Young Master Du, they should report to his parents, but to his surprise, the young lady had already taken her leave, saying she would visit again when she had the chance.

Afterward, Pei Qian encountered Liu Zhiqing, who had just recently advanced to the Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator, at Jinwu Palace, which was shrouded in storm clouds.

Liu Jianxian was a little master uncle to the head of Jinwu Palace, with a high status and even higher cultivation level. Even in North Julu, where sword cultivators were plentiful, a young Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator like Liu Zhiqing truly deserved the title of "Sword Immortal."

It was said that Liu Zhiqing had spent many years sitting in meditation at the mountain peak, in seclusion.

When Liu Zhiqing emerged from his state of deep meditation, he did so on a snowy night, breaking through his realm.

Liu Zhiqing was known for his cold demeanor, but he smiled more often at Pei Qian, the eldest disciple of Chen Ping'an. While Pei Qian didn’t think much of it, the other cultivators from Jinwu Palace looked stunned.

Liu Zhiqing dismissed some maidservants and personally brewed tea for his guests. After Pei Qian and the others were seated, he took out a set of tea utensils and drew various symbols with his fingers. Using Daoist techniques, he summoned clear spring water from the mountains and slowly boiled it with a spell that resembled a fire dragon, creating something from nothing—a display of immortal skill.

Liu Zhiqing asked Pei Qian about her travels.

Pei Qian answered him one by one.

Their exchange felt natural, as Liu Zhiqing acted like an elder returning from an official trip, while Pei Qian resembled a younger student visiting to learn.

Liu Zhiqing didn’t think he was overstepping, and Pei Qian didn’t mind him being nosy.

Having achieved great success in refining his heart and sword, Liu Zhiqing gained many benefits from his path. Not only did he smoothly reach the Nascent Soul realm, but he also felt that the bottleneck leading to the next stage of the Nascent Soul would not be too great.

All of this was thanks to Chen Ping'an’s suggestion during their time at Jade Shadow Cliff years ago.

So when considering Pei Qian, the good friend of his master’s eldest disciple, Liu Zhiqing naturally treated her as a younger generation, almost like a half-disciple.

If Pei Qian had dared to show any dissatisfaction or impatience, Liu Zhiqing, who typically avoided trouble, might have scolded her a few times.

Fortunately, Pei Qian’s performance satisfied Liu Zhiqing, although he lamented that Pei Qian was a martial artist and not a sword cultivator.

Though Wei Taizhen had already seen many prominent figures atop misty peaks, she still felt a bit of trepidation and respect in front of a promising young Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator. On one hand, Liu Jianxian was young, but on the other, his close relationship with Pei Qian’s master made him exceptionally handsome.

Liu Zhiqing sent a message to the ancestral hall of Jinwu Palace, and soon returned with some rare and valuable books from Jinwu Palace’s secret collection, all written by scholars from the history of North Julu, complete with annotations and explanations. He gifted them to Li Huai, the young scholar from Baoping Continent’s Mountain Cliff Academy.

Li Huai glanced at Pei Qian, who nodded, so he smiled and accepted the gift graciously.

Between sips of tea, Liu Zhiqing even took the time to review Pei Qian’s copied notes, stating that her handwriting surpassed that of her master.

Pei Qian became flustered, scratching her head in embarrassment.

Wei Taizhen grew increasingly curious about the young mountain lord from Luopo Mountain and who he truly was, as he seemed to have made quite an impression during his travels.

To this day, she still didn’t know that she had met that person long ago, and right in her hometown, in the Ghostly Axe Valley of Baojing Mountain, where he had even mistakenly injured her. It was the scholar her father had often described as "the most narrow-minded and petty."

This was related to Chen Ping'an not discussing his journey to Ghostly Axe Valley with Pei Qian, particularly avoiding the topics involving Gao Cheng, He Xiaoliang, and the brothers Yang Ningzhen and Yang Ningxing.

Finally, Liu Zhiqing left Jinwu Palace for the first time after his breakthrough, personally escorting Pei Qian to Spring Dew Garden.

Jinwu Palace possessed a legendary ferry that had refined thunderclouds into its hull and inscribed eighty-one thunder talismans, which meant that Pei Qian would not have to walk anymore after arriving at North Julu.

Pei Qian felt embarrassed to have Liu Zhiqing accompany them down the mountain through wind and rain.

The head of Jinwu Palace personally saw off his little master uncle, and his only son, Jin Le, was also part of the farewell party. Liu Zhiqing mentioned that during this trip, he would travel for many years, visiting various sword sects, including Floating Water Sword Lake and Taihui Sword Sect, either to seek the Dao or inquire about sword techniques. However, Jin Le’s mother, the daughter of the Mountain Lord, did not make an appearance, knowing full well that she and Liu Zhiqing simply didn’t get along. If she came, it would only be embarrassing for her. 

When Liu Zhiqing was still at the Golden Core bottleneck, she had relied on her father’s influence as the Mountain Lord to act recklessly in Jinwu Palace. However, over the years, she had grown more subdued. She was afraid of Liu Zhiqing’s temperament, hoping he wouldn’t cause her any trouble and instead would head directly to the Great Seal Dynasty to seek justice from her father.

Thus, Liu Zhiqing leaving Jinwu Palace was the happiest turn of events for her.

Pei Qian appeared calm, while Li Huai refrained from looking at the sword cultivator Jin Le. He had heard Pei Qian mention that Chen Ping'an had some past grievances with this Jin Le from Jinwu Palace because of Little Grain, but they had mostly cleared the air.

Before Liu Zhiqing departed, he gave several new mountain rules to the master of the palace, stating that anyone who dared to violate them would be met with his swift retribution upon his return to Jinwu Palace, where he would enforce the rules.

Jin Le was left feeling frightened.

In the past, Liu Zhiqing had rarely intervened in sect affairs.

Before leaving, Liu Zhiqing spoke to his nephew, "With the help of my sword, Jinwu Palace has a decent chance of advancing to the status of a sect. You know well that I’m not interested in such matters, but you, as the palace lord, are different. So remember this: being elevated to a sect is not entirely a good thing; there are both pros and cons. The advantage is that you will rejuvenate the sect and become a key contributor to the history of Jinwu Palace’s revival. The downside is that I will hold you accountable later, so while I am still at the Nascent Soul stage, make the most of it. You might even save some people from being held accountable."

Liu Zhiqing patted the palace lord's shoulder. "I mention this because I know you can handle it. So do well and don’t let your uncle be distracted by these mundane matters. Now the entire Great Seal Dynasty must actively engage with us at Jinwu Palace. A mere Mountain Lord isn’t much, let alone just his daughter?"

The palace lord nodded. "I will follow Uncle’s teachings."

The Jinwu Palace ferry sped along and encountered a vast expanse of thunderclouds. As they passed through, Liu Zhiqing used a spell to summon a lightning talisman, drawing down a spectacular display of thunder and lightning, which then merged into the ferry, making it radiate with even more golden light. The most remarkable aspect of the Jinwu Palace ferry was that it could also serve as an offensive magical treasure. However, this scene left Wei Taizhen paling in fear, for spirits and demons were innately terrified of thunder. Otherwise, with Wei Taizhen’s Golden Core cultivation, she wouldn’t have reacted so strongly.

Only then did Liu Zhiqing recall the "Wei Xianzi of Lion Peak" and quickly apologized before maneuvering the ferry away from the storm clouds.

Once they distanced themselves from the storm, the sky cleared, and Liu Zhiqing casually remarked to Pei Qian, "The Master of Taihui Sword Sect, though a sword immortal, is quite proficient in talismans. I’ve admired him for a long time."

Pei Qian quietly interjected, "Uncle Liu, my master and Liu Xiansheng are also close friends. Oh, right, Liu Xiansheng is the Master of Taihui."

The presence or absence of the word "also" made a world of difference.

Li Huai felt a bit awed by Pei Qian’s attentiveness.

Wei Taizhen was surprised that this young mountain lord had such a broad circle of friends. She was now keenly aware of Pei Qian’s temperament; the girl would never exaggerate about her close ones, so the term "close friends" was undeniably true.

First, there was Liu Zhiqing, then there was Qi Jinglong.

Both were young cultivators of North Julu, seemingly already embodying a great destiny.

Liu Zhiqing nodded with a smile. "That’s best."

Pei Qian then stated earnestly, "Uncle Liu, Master Qi enjoys drinking, but he won't easily open up to strangers. Even if you’ve never met Master Qi, you certainly aren't a stranger, so remember to bring good wine—bring more!"

Liu Zhiqing thought for a moment. While he didn’t enjoy drinking much, he could manage a bit. Since he was visiting Taihui Sword Sect to engage in swordplay and learn about talismans, he ought to carry some courtesy, so a few jars of immortal wine would suffice. He nodded, "When we reach Spring Dew Garden, I can buy some more."

Pei Qian added, "Master Liu currently has only one direct disciple named Bai Shou. Please, Uncle Liu, pass on a message for me that I’ll be passing through Taihui Sword Sect next time I return home and will visit him at Pianran Peak."

After Pei Qian finished, she chuckled to herself.

Liu Zhiqing agreed to the request.

The ferry arrived at the bustling and lively symbol-water ferry of Spring Dew Garden. Pei Qian led Li Huai and the others directly to the Ant Pavilion on Old Huai Street.

This was her own shop, a family business her master had built up in a foreign land.

Later, Pei Qian visited the Golden Core cultivator at the ancestral hall of Spring Dew Garden. The Master of Song Lanqiao was a kind-faced old woman, one of the few bamboo-generation ancestors in Spring Dew Garden. However, the disciples of the Lan generation adhered strictly to naming conventions, embedding the character "Lan" in their names. The bamboo generation, on the other hand, did not have such strict rules, using their original names from the early days of the sect's establishment, such as the mountain lord named Tan Ling.

The old woman, named Lin Chaoge, was particularly pleased to see Pei Qian, who came bearing gifts. Thus, she returned the favor generously.

Now, with her alliance with Song Lanqiao and Tang Xi, as well as her ties with the Pima Sect at Bone Marsh, the old woman’s influence in the ancestral hall of Spring Dew Garden had been growing. She was now in a position to gather spiritual money daily, with steady streams of income pouring in. 

Therefore, despite her own cultivation not being on the Path, she wished for Pei Qian to take away a mountain of gold and silver, especially after learning that Pei Qian had already reached the sixth realm of martial arts. She was so delighted that, besides returning the gifts, she had her trusted maid buy a piece of Jinwu armor from the ancestral hall and presented it to Pei Qian. Pei Qian dared not accept it, but the old woman invoked Pei Qian’s master, saying she was an elder of Pei Qian's master. Her master had visited several times without accepting her gifts, and they had agreed to save them all up together. Pei Qian should take it as a gift for her master.

The young sword immortal Chen Ping'an and his eldest disciple Pei Qian, every time they visited Spring Dew Garden, never went to see the mountain lord Tan Ling first. Instead, they always took the initiative to visit her, before heading to the Zhaoye Caotang for a chat. This was most pleasing to the old woman; both master and disciple were courteous, respectful, and valued friendships, hence their exceptional impression of the dilapidated mountain of Baoping Continent.

The old woman often told her disciple Song Lanqiao that if she traveled to other continents, she would definitely visit Luopo Mountain as a guest.

Thus, the old woman, known for her eccentric temper and sharp tongue, was extraordinarily amiable toward Pei Qian, holding the young girl’s hand and chatting away, reluctant to let her leave too soon.

By the time Pei Qian finally managed to leave the mountain, she felt a bit dazed. The old woman was just too kind and warm.

The old woman accompanied Pei Qian to the foot of the mountain, gently patting the back of her hand, reminding her to visit this lonely old lady whenever she had the chance. She also promised to prepare gifts for Pei Qian when she reached the Golden Body realm or the Wanderer realm, hoping she would break through faster and not keep the old woman waiting for too long.

Pei Qian felt a bit embarrassed, saying it would likely take at least three years to break through. The old woman chuckled, repeatedly saying, "Good, good, good."

The girl had no idea how significant her words of "treating people sincerely" would be. The old woman was both astonished and overjoyed.

After visiting the Zhaoye Caotang, Pei Qian discovered that the immortal master Tang Xi was not at the mountain, having gone to the Great Observation Dynasty to attend a gathering at a temple, followed by a mountain-water night feast. 

This was because Zhaoye Caotang and the Great Observation Dynasty's Iron Battleship Family had formed a marriage alliance. The daughter of the Wealth God of Spring Dew Garden, Tang Qingqing, had become a couple with the son of the Wei Family, and even the Emperor had personally attended the wedding. Under the tacit approval of Tan Ling, the mountain lord of Spring Dew Garden, Tang Xi’s business dealings with the Great Observation Dynasty had become increasingly frequent and close.

Pei Qian then returned to Old Huai Street.

Liu Zhiqing remained alone in the Ant Pavilion, reviewing the accounts.

Now, Liu Jianxian was not averse to dealing with mundane affairs.

The shopkeeper knew about Liu Jianxian's relationship with Chen Ping'an, so he didn’t think it was out of line at all.

After all, the two young sword immortals had shared tea and discussions at Jade Shadow Cliff, a hot topic among the mountain cultivators of the surrounding ten or so countries over the past decade.

The temporary shopkeeper, a young cultivator from Zhaoye Caotang named Wang Tingfang, had recently acquired a young assistant who had previously collaborated with Chen Jianxian on a small business involving engraved jade seals from Jade Shadow Cliff. Eventually, he had been drawn into Wang Tingfang's circle, for after hitting a cultivation bottleneck, Wang Tingfang could not remain at the shop year-round, needing to return to Zhaoye Caotang occasionally to focus on his cultivation.

The two treasured items that were once the store's prized possessions, a piece of engraved poetry and a jade bracelet with the essence of "fire in water," and an ancient mirror for dispelling evil that was crafted by a palace, had all been sold by Wang Tingfang at exorbitant prices.

The shop was not large, but business was thriving, with decent profits. 

Upon hearing that Liu Jianxian had returned to Spring Dew Garden, the shop's business boomed, overflowing with customers in less than half an hour. Most were women who spent lavishly, treating money as if it were nothing.

After catching a glimpse of Liu Jianxian, they were not satisfied and sought to purchase another item from the mountain. Many wished to steal another glance at the incredibly handsome Liu Jianxian. After all, the prices were fair, and with so many shops on Old Huai Street, where could they not spend their money? Additionally, the Ant Pavilion had many exquisite mountain items, which were particularly appealing to female cultivators.

Was it only permitted for men to admire beautiful women while they could not gaze upon Liu Jianxian?

Left behind by Pei Qian, Li Huai ran off to see the millennia-old huai tree.

Wei Taizhen naturally accompanied him.

Suddenly, Liu Zhiqing stood up in the shop and vanished.

He appeared behind a young woman and a chubby boy by the old huai tree, asking straightforwardly, "Why aren’t you two focusing on your training at Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain? Instead, you’re wandering around Jinwu Palace and following us to Spring Dew Garden. What’s your purpose?"

The two spirits were a bit far from Li Huai and Wei Taizhen, seemingly afraid to approach too closely.

Upon turning to see Liu Zhiqing, Jin Feng and Yu Lu had to admit that Liu Zhiqing's immortal presence was such that, just from his appearance, one could guess his name. Moreover, the women around the old huai tree had previously been whispering that the sword immortal Liu Zhiqing had returned to Spring Dew Garden. Thus, upon recognizing Liu Zhiqing’s identity, Jin Feng hurriedly bowed, while Yu Lu lowered his head and cupped his fists, not daring to wipe the sweat from his forehead.

Liu Zhiqing, known for his fierce methods in slaying demons and spirits, had already earned a formidable reputation even at the Golden Core stage.

Yu Lu quickly mustered his courage and explained to Liu Zhiqing through thought transmission, "Jin Feng felt a hint of Daoist opportunity upon seeing that traveling scholar ascending the mountain. When she returned to Golden Light Peak, he had already left, which is why we followed him. We hope that Sword Immortal Liu won’t regard us as ill-intentioned individuals; we absolutely are not! Otherwise, we would have retreated as soon as he entered Jinwu Palace. No matter how great the chance, it cannot be valued above life."

Liu Zhiqing nodded. "I’ve heard about your cultivation customs. You both usually show restraint and yield, which is your way of dealing with the world and protecting yourselves. However, your overall temperament is still evident. If it were not so, you wouldn’t have met me; you would have encountered my sword first."

Jin Feng and Yu Lu quickly expressed their gratitude. 

Liu Zhiqing's words were akin to a sword immortal’s decree, a sort of invisible talisman for protection. As long as Liu Zhiqing was present today and did not drive them away, anyone who coveted Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain in the future would need to think carefully before taking action.

It was said that Liu Zhiqing was not one to engage in pleasantries with outside cultivators and would often take action without warning.

Thus, Liu Zhiqing’s willingness to speak so much today left both spirits feeling fortunate yet apprehensive, along with a sense of self-consciousness.

Liu Zhiqing added, "You don’t have to be overly cautious. Don’t belittle yourselves due to your origins. As for the matter of Daoist opportunities, just go with the flow; I won’t obstruct nor favor you."

Having learned the truth, Liu Zhiqing transformed into a streak of sword light, vanishing from the bustling Ant Pavilion and heading towards the already sold Jade Shadow Cliff that Chen Ping'an owned.

Under the old huai tree, Li Huai lingered for a while. 

Wei Taizhen softly commented, "Earlier, there were two sneaky figures, but fortunately, they were questioned by Liu Xiansheng."

Li Huai replied, "Since Sword Immortal Liu has personally shown up, we can rest easy."

After all, with Pei Qian accompanying them, he wouldn’t need to worry about anything.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 818: Questions of Martial Arts (2)**

As they traveled along the path, Wei Taizhen found herself increasingly impressed by Li Huai's carefree nature. It was as if he genuinely didn't care about many things.

However, every day when he had some free time, Li Huai would diligently recite passages from ancient texts. Yet, Wei Taizhen noticed that this Young Master Li was not particularly studious; he was just hard-working.

Unbeknownst to him, Li Huai's actions had earned him a moment of respect from Wei Xianzi (Fairy Wei).

Underneath the old locust tree, a tree that seemed to invite people back to their hometowns, Li Huai was suddenly flooded with memories from his childhood.

Back in those days, at their home on the western edge of the small town, whenever his father managed to earn a little money, his mother would pour her heart into cooking with oil and salt, and some of their meals would taste better than usual. Forget about meat; every time Li Huai picked up a chopstick full of stir-fried greens, it felt like he was pulling a pitiful little creature from the oil vat or salt bag. His sister, who was unmarried and seemed like a wronged little wife, would only say that the food was "fine" whenever he asked her about the saltiness.

"Fine" my foot! Li Huai wouldn't accept such grievances. He would stand on the long bench to protest. His mother, afraid to scold him harshly, would complain about how her son didn't know how to enjoy life, and after a few complaints, her heart would soften. She couldn't bear to say anything bad about her precious son and would turn to grumble about her own husband, lamenting how Li Er was to blame for her son living a hard life, so much so that he couldn't even tolerate the slightest bit of oil or grease. Then, she would begin to give earnest advice to her daughter, Li Liu, about finding a good family with a solid background and a man who could provide for her brother. She would remind her to keep an eye out and secretly support their family, lest a married daughter become like spilled water, forsaken and condemned.

After all the chatter, it was always Li Huai and his mother exchanging words, and that frighteningly frugal meal would come to an end, with his father and sister cleaning up the dishes.

Day after day, year after year, they lived a stable and uneventful life. As long as his mother didn't leave the house to argue with the neighbors and lose, or if during festivals she didn't feel the pressure from her relatives, and didn't see any other wives flaunting their gold and silver, there really wasn't much going on at home.

As a child, Li Huai dreaded his father coming to the school to find him.

It was embarrassing.

His father was notoriously incompetent, to the point where Li Huai wondered if his parents were on the verge of separating, at which point he would likely follow his mother into a life of hardship, while his sister would suffer alongside their father. So, even if he felt that his father's incompetence caused him to be looked down upon by his peers, he still didn't want his parents to split up. Even if they were all suffering together, at least they had a home.

Li Huai would have preferred if his sister went to the school to call him back home since she was decent-looking and not bad at all. But there were plenty of boys, like Lin Shouyi and Dong Shuijing, who secretly admired his sister. Li Huai, distracted by these thoughts at such a young age, couldn't help but ponder these trivial matters. He never understood what was so appealing about Li Liu; was she pretty? Not really. If they married her, could she carry more buckets of water or chop more firewood? No way.

Later, when he followed Li Baoping and the others to the Cliff Academy, his parents and sister came to see him, and at that moment, Li Huai no longer felt the slightest bit of embarrassment, even though the academy was filled with wealthy students.

Thus, Li Huai sincerely admired Chen Pingan. From Chen Pingan, Li Huai learned a lot. 

Not because of what Chen Pingan said, but because of what he consistently did, which Li Huai had quietly observed and etched in his heart.

However, at that time, getting Li Huai to say "thank you" was harder than climbing to the sky. He knew he had done something wrong, but apologizing was just as difficult.

To outsiders, he was Li Huai's grand uncle, but within his own circle, he was the king of the world.

As his academic journey progressed, all his friends were long past being children.

Li Baoping's knowledge grew, and he went to Central Continent to follow the Master of Maoshan to the Li Ji Academy. Yu Lu was already a Gold Body martial artist and had regained his resolve to pursue cultivation. Lin Mutou was being courted by the affluent families of Daxuijiang City, yet it seemed he still harbored a crush on his sister and continued to have a secret rivalry with Dong Shuijing. Still, this did not hinder Lin Mutou from increasingly resembling a celestial being.

It seemed that Li Huai was the only one who remained somewhat idle.

What a worry.

Li Huai collected his thoughts.

He and Wei Taizhen returned to the Ant Shop.

Liu Jiansian was no longer at the shop, but there were still many women present.

Pei Qian was discussing something with the shopkeeper about whether they could sell the mural town's divine maiden images, and if it went well, she would take the lead in opening a shop there.

With nothing else to do, Li Huai sat outside the Ant Shop in a daze.

The next day, after bidding farewell to Liu Zhiqing, Pei Qian and the others continued their journey on foot, leaving the Spring Dew Garden.

Pei Qian first headed to the summit of the Fuhua Kingdom to participate in a sword ceremony with her master and Liu Jinglong.

Unexpectedly, that ordinary mountain with little spiritual energy had become a place where several sword cultivators gathered. Qi practitioners came and went frequently to admire the beautiful scenery, mainly because Qi Jinglong had entered the Jade Purity realm earlier than Lin Su and Xu Xuan. He had been questioned by the three sword immortals, including Bai Chang, and after going to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he returned to become the head of the Taihui Sword Sect. Adding to that, Qi Jinglong was young enough to be among the top ten, and he had attracted the attention of two immortals, Lu Sui from the Water Classic and Sun Qing, the lord of Caique Mansion. At barely over a hundred years old, he was truly legendary.

Thus, the place where he and that unknown sword immortal had previously held a sword ceremony became an attractive spot for tourists, which made perfect sense.

Next, Pei Qian embarked on a journey different from her master's.

She no longer headed to the Green Oriole Kingdom at the mouth of the Jidu River.

Instead, she and her companions turned towards the capital of the Dazhuan Dynasty, where Pei Qian sought to see the place where the martial artist Gu You and the sword immortal Ji Yue exchanged martial arts.

On that side, Pei Qian stood alone, holding her walking staff, gazing up at the sky, lost in thought.

Li Huai and Wei Taizhen stood at a distance.

Suddenly, Li Huai felt a bit confused. It was as if Pei Qian had truly grown up, making her feel somewhat unfamiliar to him. She was no longer the short, chubby girl he remembered. He recalled when they first engaged in a battle of wits; Pei Qian would stand on a stool to appear taller and wouldn't allow Li Huai to follow suit. Now, it seemed she didn't need to anymore. It felt like Pei Qian had matured suddenly, and he had only just realized this.

With no one around, Pei Qian took off her book box and placed her walking staff on top of it.

Starting with a six-step stance, she practiced the Mountain Shaking Fist, moving through various stances and concluding with the Divine Drum Beat stance. 

Throughout her practice, Pei Qian maintained a strong focus on her martial intent.

It was as if she were gently knocking on a door; since there was no one home, she greeted it and left.

During her travels, Pei Qian claimed that every step she took was like practicing stances.

Li Huai believed her.

After that, Pei Qian visited the already-sealed-off Howling Ape Mountain, where at the edge of the territory, she tightly gripped her walking staff, raised it high, and cupped her fists in a farewell salute.

The journey between the Dazhuan capital and Howling Ape Mountain was filled with little conversation from Pei Qian, leaving Li Huai a bit bored.

On a snowy day, Li Huai suddenly realized that they had been away from home for three years.

And they had arrived at the state capital of Qinghao Kingdom, at a place called Dongxian Street.

They met Li Baoping's elder brother, Li Xisheng, as well as a young book attendant named Cui Ci.

Li Xisheng gifted Li Huai a thin book of ancient texts.

He also gave Wei Taizhen a cloud-patterned talisman, which had four characters that were not in seal script, resembling characters made up by scholars, so Wei Taizhen didn't recognize the talisman.

The gentle scholar joked with Wei Taizhen that if she were to break through in the future, this talisman might be of some use.

The four characters on the talisman were actually "Five Thunder Avoidance."

The headmaster of the White Jade Capital in the realm of Qingming, Dao Lao Er and Lu Chen's senior brother, had personally inscribed it. What did it matter if there was an entire world in between?

A decree is a decree.

Breaking through is just breaking through.

However, Li Xisheng did not give Pei Qian anything.

Pei Qian remained cheerful, chatting with Li Xisheng about the interesting events of reuniting with her sister Baoping.

Li Xisheng consistently wore a warm smile, patiently listening to the girl's stories.

It was only during a clear morning and a twilight evening that they had agreed to watch the sun rise and the moon rise together.

After leaving Qinghao Kingdom, they headed to Lion Peak. Pei Qian's little booklet no longer had any must-visit places.

Meanwhile, Li Xisheng found Jin Feng and Yu Lu in the city and kept them by his side.

In truth, Pei Qian had already noticed but pretended not to.

The distance from the Wang Peak to Lion Peak was too far, and Pei Qian didn't want to take a lengthy detour. Li Huai didn't hurry her; it wasn't a reason for Pei Qian to take a detour.

Having spent years together, Wei Taizhen and Pei Qian had become quite familiar with each other, so some questions could now be asked directly.

For example, why did Pei Qian deliberately avoid the immortal mountain peaks outside her little booklet, even going out of her way to avoid encounters in the wilderness? There were many strange creatures and mountain spirits, yet Pei Qian remained indifferent, and they could each go their own way.

Pei Qian simply said she was afraid of causing trouble because she knew that her judgment was not up to par compared to her master and junior brother. She worried about not being able to distinguish between good and bad people, about being too heavy-handed in her strikes, and easily making mistakes. Since she was afraid, she chose to avoid it. After all, the mountains and rivers remained unchanged; as long as she copied books and practiced martial arts diligently, it didn't matter whether she encountered anyone.

Pei Qian also mentioned that she didn't particularly enjoy traveling the martial world.

Wei Taizhen then asked her why, if she didn't like it, she had come all the way to North Ju Lu State.

Pei Qian hesitated for a long time before smiling and saying that there were several pure martial artists in her family, and she didn't want to break through there. It was only because her master enjoyed North Ju Lu State that she came to travel.

This was a vague answer that amounted to nothing.

Then Pei Qian added something that left Wei Taizhen even more confused, saying that since her master liked this place, she was beginning to regret it.

Wei Taizhen felt that the more she asked, the more muddled it became; it was like stepping into a cloud of mist.

However, Pei Qian began practicing her stances again, leaving Wei Taizhen with no choice but to stop overthinking.

Li Huai had grown accustomed to keeping watch. Seeing that Wei Taizhen was in a fog, he turned to Pei Qian and asked if he could speak.

Pei Qian nodded lightly while continuing her training.

Li Huai then explained to Wei Taizhen, “Pei Qian is already at the Seventh Realm. Once we reach Lion Peak, she plans to head to the Aiai Continent to compete for something that sounds like ‘the strongest.’ It seems that if one becomes the strongest, they can earn martial fortune.”

Wei Taizhen appeared struck by a thunderbolt.

Li Huai laughed, “I don't even know how Pei Qian plans to break through. It's not like she was deliberately keeping it from you. She didn’t inform me either; she only told me after she left Qinghao Kingdom. She mentioned that now, practicing martial arts every day isn’t as meaningful. It’s similar to her current stance practice, dividing her martial intent into two to spar with herself, just a habit formed naturally, otherwise, she would feel stifled. Also, the idea of earning martial fortune through practicing martial arts isn’t something a disciple should surpass their master in. Martial fortune, when consumed in excess, actually loses its flavor. For her, it might not be a good thing.”

Pei Qian, from a distance, stopped her practice and helplessly said, “You’ve said too much. Just stick to the part about my Seventh Realm.”

Then she turned to Wei Taizhen and said, “Sister Wei, don’t take offense; it’s not that I’m hiding things from you, but some matters simply aren’t worth discussing.”

With her master being so high up, and with Grandpa Cui in front, enduring hardships in martial arts, breaking through, all made perfect sense.

Wei Taizhen could only smile wryly and nod. 

What else could she do?

Fortunately, Wei Taizhen knew a bit about the martial path, though not much. After all, on her own cultivation journey, she broke through to the Golden Core realm through perseverance, so she wasn’t entirely daunted by Pei Qian's breakthroughs or martial fortunes. Still, she was shocked by Pei Qian's nonchalant attitude towards martial realms, which seemed inconsistent with her age. Moreover, climbing the martial path required more down-to-earth efforts compared to those who pursued cultivation. If one were to say that Pei Qian's rapid breakthroughs were due to her excellent aptitude, that wouldn't be entirely accurate, as she practiced martial arts daily and did it quite peculiarly, like practicing her punches while walking, having her martial intent spar with itself, and finding martial fortune bland—none of which Wei Taizhen had heard of or could imagine.

After that, during their travels in the mountains.

Even if Pei Qian continued to avoid people and matters, they still encountered a storm involving deities from the mountains affecting the martial world below in a small, obscure country.

A martial arts master leading the martial world had a dispute with an earth deity. The former summoned several mountain spirits recognized by the court, while the latter rallied a group of neighboring immortal masters. What was clearly a personal feud between the two escalated into a standoff involving hundreds of people. That venerable martial artist, at the age of seventy, took on the role of a leader in the martial world, rallying friends and commanding the crowd, while the Golden Core earth deity used all his connections to ensure that the old man from the mountain below learned the difference between the heavenly and earthly ways.

When Pei Qian passed by, the battle had already concluded, and the victor and loser had been decided, with the mountain's immortal masters fleeing in disgrace. It turned out that the court had secretly placed many offerings and experts in the military who had long been displeased with that earth deity, known for his penchant for meddling with emperors and generals. Amidst the fierce battle, an old immortal who should have been a close friend betrayed his Golden Core companion, and during the height of the battle, he struck unexpectedly, catching the arrogant earth deity off guard, even causing him to lose his Golden Core to a direct attack from a close disciple, leading to his demise.

A shattered immortal mountain, a rout of soldiers, a bloody storm unfolded, with the heavens and earth, the temple and the martial world, gods and mortals, all tangled in schemes and plots, perhaps this was indeed the saying that even a small sparrow is complete with all its organs.

All the right and wrong, the good and the evil, became a muddled mess in the face of life and death.

Even though Pei Qian aimed to leave the tumultuous scene, she was still a moment too late.

The small kingdom's court had ambushed troops gathering around them like fish in a net.

A group of mountain immortal masters fled towards Pei Qian and her companions, brushing past them. One of them even dropped a dazzling immortal jade pendant at Pei Qian's feet, which she swiftly flicked back with her toes.

Following that, a large group of people surged forth, whether driven mad with bloodlust or determined to kill without sparing anyone. A middle-aged martial general clad in dew armor swung his blade.

Pei Qian neither dodged nor evaded but reached out to grasp the blade, saying, “We are merely passing by and will not interfere in your disputes.”

The general increased the force behind his strike, but the blade remained unmoved.

Pei Qian gently pushed, sending the martial general, along with his sword, staggering back.

From a distance behind Pei Qian, a martial arts master who had been lying in wait emerged and swiftly dispatched the group of mountain masters, leaving only a few survivors.

Pei Qian surveyed her surroundings, then concentrated her voice into a line, saying to Li Huai and Wei Taizhen, “Just wait for an opportunity to leave; don’t worry. Trust me.”

Wei Taizhen was about to speak, offering her help, but Li Huai shook his head at her.

If they encountered a tricky situation, Pei Qian would never seek help from anyone unless Chen Pingan was nearby. The reasoning was simple.

Deep down, Pei Qian did not want to owe anyone anything except her master.

Thus, Li Huai approached Wei Taizhen and quietly asked, “Can you protect yourself, Sister Wei?”

Wei Taizhen nodded, “I should be able to protect Young Master Li.”

Li Huai said, “Then we should look for a chance to escape, making sure not to distract Pei Qian.”

Wei Taizhen looked troubled and whispered, “Young Master Li, if that’s the case, wouldn’t Pei Qian harbor some resentment towards you?”

Li Huai shook his head, “Sister Wei, you’re overthinking it.”

Li Huai scratched his head, feeling like a useless person. What to do? Worries clouded his mind.

Pei Qian gently removed her bamboo box, set down her walking staff, and said to an approaching white-haired, burly old man, “Let me make this clear: if you dare to harm my friends or damage my belongings, I won’t reason with you—I’ll strike to kill.”

The blood-soaked white-haired old man scoffed, “Little girl, you’re young but speak big words. Just hand over that jade pendant, and I’ll spare your life.”

Pei Qian rolled up her sleeves, saying, “I’ll stand here without moving and let you strike me three times. After that, you’ll let us three go, how about that?”

The martial general, glancing at the girl’s unscathed hand, quietly reminded the old man, “Master, this girl is not simple. She held the sword without injury, and her physique is extraordinary.”

The old man chuckled, “With the army surrounding you, there’s no way to fly away.”

Then, the old man leisurely looked at the veiled girl and asked, “Are you an infant immortal?”

Wei Taizhen remained silent.

The old man then asked Li Huai, “Are you a gentleman of the academy?”

Li Huai replied, “I hope so.”

Lastly, the old man asked the slender, intimidating girl, “You wouldn’t be the legendary Wind-dominating martial artist, would you?”

Pei Qian said, “Not quite.”

The old man burst into laughter, “Then I’ll stand here without moving and let you strike me first. If you can land a hit that doesn’t kill me, you all will live.”

Pei Qian solemnly replied, “I urge you, senior, to negotiate properly. Don’t force me into a corner; offer some choices that aren’t choices.”

The old man’s smile faded as he twisted his wrist, “Alright then, I’ll let you strike three times. If you can withstand them and still get up afterward, I’ll let you three go.”

Pei Qian stepped forward, “Strike.”

Suddenly, Li Huai said, “We come from Lion Peak.”

The old man laughed, “Very well. I’m a guest of the Heavenly Monarch’s court. So what? Is that of any use?”

Pei Qian bent her knees slightly, stepping forward into a stance, preparing her punch.

The old man laughed heartily, “I recognize that; it’s the Mountain Shaking Fist from that useless Gu You. A pure martial artist, and you dare use talisman techniques to deceive Ji Jianxian. That old fool doesn’t accept disciples and leaves behind a useless fist manual for everyone to learn; he’s done a disservice to many!”

In an instant, the burly old man arrived before the girl, delivering a punch directly to her forehead.

Pei Qian merely swayed slightly, not stepping back.

According to martial experiences, Pei Qian should have been sent flying, shaking before she could recover from the second punch.

However, at this moment, facing this person, Pei Qian refused to retreat.

The burly old man, a Gold Body martial artist, roared as he unleashed two punches—one aimed at the girl’s face and the other at her neck.

After three punches, the old man swiftly retreated, standing shoulder to shoulder with the martial general, his expression dark.

Pei Qian stood firm, slowly raising her hand to wipe away the blood from her nose.

Seeing the three behind her, a calm companion of the old man finally sighed in relief.

That person was also a Seventh Realm master, but younger and more skilled in fist techniques. He and the emperor had been old friends and had made an exception to come out and help this time.

Moreover, in North Ju Lu State, who among the pure martial artists wouldn’t relish the chance to strike down an immortal from the mountain?

Pei Qian spat out a mouthful of blood and turned to the composed middle-aged man.

That man smiled and asked, “Little girl, you’re also a Gold Body martial artist, aren’t you?”

Pei Qian remained silent.

The man continued, “Little girl, you can’t travel far on the wind. Even if your two friends can escape, the net used against that Golden Core earth deity earlier can simply be cast again. What difficulty is there? You should plead with Senior Fu Lin for mercy; just ask for your lives and leave all your belongings behind. I can only help you to this extent. But I can’t guarantee whether a martial artist would lose their skills or a cultivator would have their path to immortality broken. I’m ultimately an outsider.”

Li Huai said helplessly, “Don’t believe such words.”

Pei Qian nodded, “You’re not foolish.”

Li Huai grinned.

Wei Taizhen felt speechless.

One was fearless, and so was the other.

She had already made the worst of plans, ready to use the two precious defensive treasures gifted by her master, risking her life to ensure the two of them could escape this place.

Suddenly, the man said, “If you can withstand two of my punches, I’ll let your friends leave first.”

Li Huai remarked, “Don’t believe that either.”

Pei Qian said, “One is starving, and the other is fully armed yet plays tricks on a junior. Are you really martial artists?”

Pei Qian answered her own question, “I don’t think you’re worthy.”

Ignoring the middle-aged man behind her, Pei Qian fixed her gaze on the white-haired old man named Fu Lin, “I’ll ask you with the Mountain Shaking Manual, one punch!”

The old man’s expression fluctuated. 

After delivering three punches earlier, his entire arm was now in pain.

Suddenly, Pei Qian unleashed a powerful martial intent that soared like the sun and moon into the sky. 

The chaotic energy forced Wei Taizhen to quickly shield Li Huai.

Pei Qian moved forward slowly, her fists clenched tightly, gritting her teeth, “I learned my punches from my master, who learned from the Mountain Shaking Manual, and the Mountain Shaking Fist comes from Senior Gu! Today, I’ll use the Mountain Shaking Fist to challenge you at the same realm. Do you dare not accept?!”

With Pei Qian as the center, the ground within a hundred feet began to tremble, like muffled thunder echoing, dust swirling, and the soldiers gripping their swords unsteadily, their iron armor ringing.

The middle-aged man intentionally or unintentionally took a few steps back.

Pei Qian, facing the white-haired old man, had a grim expression. She hesitated, wanting to speak but held back. 

In front of everyone, how could he bow his head in apology to an outsider, especially when that meant losing face in the martial world? Yet, if he accepted the punch from Pei Qian and walked away unharmed, he had no confidence in doing so.

If you can’t comprehend, then don’t overthink it.

Pei Qian stepped forward, instantly vanishing from sight.

Everyone's stance wavered.

Wei Taizhen instinctively reached out to support Li Huai's shoulder but found that this Young Master Li needed no assistance; he stood firm like a mountain.

Li Huai was too focused on worrying about Pei Qian to notice this.

Wei Taizhen gazed intently and was startled to find countless fine golden threads faintly entwined around Li Huai's sleeves, invisibly counteracting the overwhelming martial intent that Pei Qian unleashed.

Fu Lin's position resounded like a heavy drum.

The white-haired old man lay sprawled on the ground, seemingly struck on the forehead by Pei Qian's punch. The force was so swift, and the angle of her punch changed so suddenly that after a single blow, the Seventh Realm master Fu Lin lay directly on the ground, his head slightly sunken into the earth.

Pei Qian twisted her body and began to face the middle-aged martial artist, who had begun to show signs of retreat.

She slightly lowered her stance, using the peak stance of a Confucian scholar to channel the monkey fist intent taught by Zhu Lian, aligning her entire spine into a great dragon.

Pei Qian suddenly looked at Li Huai, seemingly asking for his approval.

Li Huai nodded solemnly, “Just strike at him. This man has worse intentions; hitting him until he’s half dead is acceptable. If your master scolds you for this matter, I’ll cry and plead with your master.”

Pei Qian's expression turned cold, but she smiled slightly.

Li Huai's words had clearly reached her.

Wei Taizhen found the scene unsettling and frightening.

Pei Qian unleashed a punch with the Divine Drum Beat stance.

With just that single punch, there was no need for the ten or twenty following punches.

The middle-aged man had no power to fight back and was sent flying several dozen feet, crashing heavily to the ground.

Pei Qian stood where she was, surveying her surroundings, “Come at me!”

Within a hundred feet of her, except for where Li Huai and Wei Taizhen stood, the ground split open, and martial intent surged upward, reaching the heavens.

Pei Qian caught sight of a group of Qi practitioners stirring in the sky.

Pei Qian leaped into the air.

Like a bolt of sword light, she departed from the mortal realm.

A massive circle, like a hanging loft in the sky, collapsed with a thunderous roar.

Li Huai, in a flash, hurriedly picked up Pei Qian's bamboo box and walking staff.

If they were damaged, who else could Pei Qian hold accountable? If not him, then who?

Pei Qian hovered in mid-air, pinching her fingers together, tapping her forehead, signaling the group of cultivators to unleash their immortal techniques without hesitation.

Wei Taizhen couldn't help but tremble, “Young Master Li, didn’t you say Pei Qian was just a Gold Body martial artist?”

Wei Taizhen didn’t know much about martial arts, but how could she find a reason to convince herself that it wasn’t strange for Pei Qian to be in the realm of far travel at just over twenty years old? 

Pei Qian was certainly not the martial artist Cao Ci from Central Continent. She was just a delicate girl who carried a bamboo box and wandered beside Wei Taizhen every day.

Li Huai gently set down the bamboo box, looked up at Pei Qian, thought for a moment, and scratched his head, “I’m not Chen Pingan; whatever he says, Pei Qian listens. Whatever Pei Qian does, he just says.”

Then Li Huai couldn’t hold back a laugh, “Truly worthy of our new alliance leader. Sister Wei, if you’re willing, I can help introduce you.”

Wei Taizhen glanced at Li Huai. This Young Master Li remained as carefree as ever.

Pei Qian, traveling on the wind, moved with an unpredictable grace, sometimes standing behind the mountain immortals or beside them, neither speaking nor striking.

Finally, Pei Qian lightly stepped, generating a tremendous ripple in the sky that spread outwards, and her figure vanished without a trace.

Once Pei Qian landed, the ground was deserted.

Without a word, Pei Qian slung her bamboo box over her shoulder, holding her walking staff, and said, “Let’s hurry.”

A year later, they finally reached Lion Peak.

Wei Taizhen felt a great sense of relief; she no longer had to worry.

But her master was not at the summit.

Pei Qian remained atop the mountain for a full six months, occasionally descending for a visit.

After six months, Pei Qian left alone, parting ways with Li Huai. He would return to Baoping Continent, while she would set off on her own to the icy northern Aiai Continent.

The reason was that her master had an average impression of that continent, so she wanted to reach the pinnacle of the mountain realm there. However, this time, she wouldn’t rush; the previous two realms had been too casual, posing significant risks. She needed to take it slow, as stagnation for eight or even ten years was possible; otherwise, it would be difficult to firmly establish herself in the next realm.

At the foot of Lion Peak, during their last meal at the shop, Li Liu returned, and the family, along with Pei Qian, dined together.

The woman felt that her son’s choices weren’t too bad, but they could be better.

Li Huai noticed the way his mother looked at Pei Qian, the smile on her face, and he broke into a cold sweat. Previously, when his mother had privately mentioned this, the usually fearless Li Huai nearly knelt down on the spot, pleading with her not to harbor such thoughts; otherwise, he would run away from home. After all, if he stayed, he would likely be beaten to death by Pei Qian.

When Pei Qian left the small town at the foot of the mountain, Li Er merely nodded at the girl, not coming out to see her off.

The woman exchanged glances with Li Liu, who nudged her brother. Li Huai, initially feeling a bittersweet sense of parting, suddenly became anxious, struggling to keep up with Pei Qian.

Walking down the street, Pei Qian said, “That travel journal you hid, I’ve seen it. I’m fine.”

Li Huai was at a loss for words, letting out a sigh and responding with an “Mm.”

Pei Qian said, “No need to send me off. We can travel together next time. We’ll go to Central Continent then.”

Li Huai nodded, “It’s a promise.”

Pei Qian strode ahead, turning her back to Li Huai, lightly waving her hand.

Li Huai stood still, waving goodbye to her.

It seemed Pei Qian had grown taller again, transforming from a slightly darker-skinned girl into a young woman of twenty.

In a secluded spot, Pei Qian suddenly rose in stature and quietly traveled on the wind.

The old chef from the Distant Ruins Mountain was a far-travel martial artist, and the martial fortunes in Baoping Continent were limited. With her master and Song Changjing present, along with Li Er, who also belonged to Baoping Continent, Pei Qian wouldn’t return anytime soon unless she broke through to the mountain peak realm.

Regardless of how much she enjoyed keeping accounts for Zhu Lian, he was the old chef from her own Distant Ruins Mountain. She wouldn’t compete for martial fortunes with anyone, nor would the old chef contend with her. However, he was a steward who needed to protect Distant Ruins Mountain from straying too far. So Pei Qian was willing to venture further, going through North Ju Lu State before heading to the Aiai Continent. After all, her master wouldn’t be returning home anytime soon. Whenever she heard that her master was back from the Sword Qi Great Wall to the realm of Haoran, she would return. Her master had taught her so much over the years, but she had only sparred with him once. How could that suffice?

Her master had more than one student, but Pei Qian had only one master.

Before her master returned home, Pei Qian still wanted to challenge Cao Ci!

 ### Chapter 819: The Greatest in the World

The three thousand Daoists from the Azure Sky Realm entered the Fifth Realm in an orderly fashion. Among them, the White Jade Capital (Baiyu Jing) occupied the largest share, with over a thousand members. The other first-rate sects included the Xuandu Temple (Xuandu Guan), the Year-End Palace (Suichu Gong), the Immortal Staff Sect (Xianzhang Pai), and the Spirit Resolution Mountain (Bingjie Shan), each with two to three hundred Daoists. The next tier consisted of lesser immortal practitioners, with their numbers decreasing in succession. Regardless of their sect background, most belonged to the orthodox Dao officials of the Azure Sky Realm, as the Daoist credential system was recognized throughout the realms.

Additionally, there were three thousand disciples of the Buddhist sects. 

And then there were the countless refugees pouring into the Fifth Realm. After just two years since the gates opened, their numbers had swelled to nearly ten million.

Beneath the Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) cultivators, all walks of life were represented—those who practiced on the mountains, and the common folk below, a mix of fish and dragons, all bearing witness to the immense joys and sorrows of survival. 

They hailed from the southeastern Tongye Continent and the southwestern Fuyou Continent. However, the numbers were vastly different; Fuyou Continent only had a small migration from the eastern coastal regions, while Tongye Continent experienced a full-scale exodus.

Each had a great sword immortal responsible for opening two grand gates. 

The one who opened the gate with a sword was the old sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Qi Tingji. 

The lineage of the Confucian Sage stood to the left and right.

These two sword immortals were tasked not only with opening the gates but also with guarding them against the onslaught of great demons.

The three thousand Daoists were primarily stationed to the east, where the Daoists of White Jade Capital had united to create a vast sea of clouds, suffused with purple energy, bringing forth showers of rain to nourish the land. 

The cloud sea was uneven; all peaks rising above it became contested grounds for White Jade Capital and the other Daoists. 

Some peaks were not far from the ground, while others, despite their height, could not surpass the cloud sea, depending on the abundance of spiritual energy and fortune. 

Following the guidance of the five cities’ twelve towers, the Daoists of White Jade Capital carefully selected five neighboring peaks to carve out a map of the Five Great Mountains, using magical treasures to suppress the peaks and gather spiritual energy. Whenever the Five Great Mountains emerged, they formed the foundation for a great dynasty or a vassal state. Furthermore, this process had a clever use—vast amounts of spiritual energy from heaven and earth would be "imprisoned" near the mountain peaks, causing many hidden treasures of heaven and earth to spontaneously reveal their luminous phenomena. Once the Daoists from White Jade Capital followed these clues, they could swiftly gather these treasures, akin to fishing in a dried-up pond. This method did not deplete spiritual energy; rather, it condensed scattered fortunes into swirling energies that circled the Five Great Mountains or were expelled into rivers and stabilized there, serving as future sites for divine spirits.

However, the sword immortal lineage from Xuandu Temple was particularly vexing to the Daoists of White Jade Capital. They occupied only a few mountains with decent spiritual energy and began to sabotage the efforts of others, engaging in activities that were clearly detrimental to all. Each time they waited until the painstakingly carved map of the Five Great Mountains was almost complete before secretly drawing a map for their own sect, indicating the direction for their sword immortals. The absence of even one map would render the entire effort useless, making it extremely difficult to select a new mountain site, with the losses being immeasurable.

Due to the reckless actions of the Xuandu Temple sword immortals, the Year-End Palace and several other top-tier immortal sects experienced unexpected joy. They hastily concluded contracts to delineate their respective territories, striving to minimize unnecessary conflicts, all to secure as many feng shui treasures with potential as possible before White Jade Capital could act.

In summary, the three thousand Daoists each had their long-term plans, with various conflicts erupting continuously. 

The three thousand monks were positioned to the west. 

The refugees from Fuyou Continent surged into the north. 

The migrating refugees from Tongye Continent settled in the south. 

The city occupied by the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall was situated centrally. 

Ning Yao had already set off on her sword in the east. Upon catching sight of the Dao-infused purple cloud sea in the distance, she pondered briefly before heading south.

The mountains and rivers stretched far, and the world was quiet.

However, amidst the close surroundings, two peculiar heads suddenly emerged.

Yet, the fights were far from over.

This of course implied that the newly unnamed Fifth Realm was fraught with dangers.

On the other side of the Heavenly Gate, Lu Chen extended a finger, rubbing his lips with a smile, "Daoist Sun, this kind of injuring feelings isn't quite appropriate, is it? If I return to White Jade Capital, it would be difficult to explain to my senior brother. We should wrap things up soon. You know how my senior brother is; when he gets angry, he doesn't care about anything. If he goes to Xuandu Temple, I won't be able to dissuade him."

The junior disciple, Shan Qing, stood nearby, his expression grave.

The little Daoist boy, carrying a “Doubled Measure” sword-holding gourd on his back, seemed somewhat gleeful, wishing for Lu Chen and Daoist Sun to clash.

Daoist Sun, feeling guilty, said, "My disciples are all unruly, like wild horses. The young ones are hot-headed and lack discretion. What can I do? If I don’t intervene, the rules will be broken. Should I go and mediate, acting as a peacemaker?"

The little Daoist boy, who had been eavesdropping on the conversation, thought to himself that Daoist Sun was truly skilled at speaking nonsense, and he needed to learn from this. In the future, when he encountered that old scholar, it would be hard to tell who was blaming whom.

Daoist Sun chuckled, "However, Daoist Lu, you must first inform the Confucian Sage. I can’t let myself break the rule of not stepping outside the boundaries of the hundred feet. After all, this is a rule set by the Sage of Rites himself, and I hold great respect for him. You, however, Daoist Lu, are different; you have the courage and a good master as your backing. Unfortunately, my senior ancestor from Xuandu Temple has long passed away. If I were to lose a fight, who would I complain to?”

Lu Chen replied helplessly, "I don’t get along with that Sage of Rites. Don’t you know, Daoist Sun?"

Daoist Sun laughed heartily, "I’m getting old; I easily forget things."

The little Daoist boy was impressed.

Shan Qing furrowed his brow deeply. 

If this continued with Xuandu Temple stirring things up, it would set off a chain reaction that could delay his senior brother’s plan to cross the Fifth Realm and gather five hundred spiritual officials by several hundred years.

Lu Chen raised his hand to stroke the lotus crown on his head, smiling as he comforted the anxious little junior brother, "Every result, big or small, is a manifestation of countless great paths. Just let it flow naturally; being an observer is enough."

Lu Chen truly didn’t care about the conflicts between the Daoists of White Jade Capital and the sword immortals of Xuandu Temple. However, some things had to be addressed, so he could deflect any inquiries from his senior brother or master once he returned to White Jade Capital or the Lotus Cave. But in the eyes of the little junior brother, the matters right in front of him were his own, and whether they were good or bad, the situation was decidedly bleak.

Lu Chen hopped a couple of times, peering into the southern direction, "Little Stinky Cow Nose, it’s time for you to get down to business. I can help you deliver that iron ring and your sword-holding gourd to the Confucian Sage."

The little Daoist boy exploded in anger, "Lu Sect Leader, please speak to me politely!"

This little firewood boy from the temple had always kept to the rules when it came to Lu Chen.

He was hardly afraid of Lu Chen, but before his master went to the Azure Sky Realm, he had been instructed on three matters, one of which was to avoid enmity with Lu Chen.

Moreover, he had to take one of the Lotus Flower Blessed Lands and place it somewhere in the Fifth Realm, in a spot where there were currently no signs of habitation.

On Tongye Continent, there stood a grand structure known as the Demon Suppressing Tower, which was a timeless phoenix tree, named the Demon Suppressing Tower, similar in meaning to the Demon Suppressing White Manifestation. It was merely a superficial show put on by the scholars.

The old master had not touched the roots of the Demon Suppressing Tower, but without the iron ring belonging to the old Daoist as the pivot of the great formation, it was of little significance. So, there was a chance to earn some merit from this. Additionally, with the Doubled Measure sword-holding gourd, that was two chances. According to the little Daoist boy’s speculation, if his master accidentally argued with the Dao Ancestor and lost, he could at least use these two merits to get the Sage of Rites to intercede, allowing both him and his master to return to the Great Integrity World without having to stay in the Azure Sky Realm and endure others’ faces. As for what his master truly intended, and what he would ultimately do, the little Daoist boy didn’t care; he was already used to being dependent on his master.

Lu Chen calling the firewood boy “Little Cow Nose” was an insult, a double insult that included the old man who had grown old. As the disciple, he obviously couldn’t tolerate that!

Lu Chen said, "Little Cow Nose, your old master has worked hard to accumulate some incense merit for you. Don’t use it all up so quickly; take it easy."

The little Daoist boy asked curiously, "What do you mean?"

The firewood boy had always considered himself the head disciple of the temple, yet the old Daoist had never regarded the little fellow as anything special, which was a rather unfortunate aspect of life.

Lu Chen smiled, "The Lotus Flower Blessed Land is divided into four parts, and giving the Tongye Umbrella to Chen Ping'an was calculated because he would definitely be restless, eager to go there and practice, seeking the Dao and questioning his heart. Then he would encounter numerous trivial predicaments filled with right and wrong, like the feathers of a goose accumulating into a mountain, making it far more difficult to move than transporting stones of the same weight. Ultimately, Chen Ping'an would realize that the practice of Dao hinges merely on the heart, which encompasses all—large and small, complex and simple, and all changes converge into one. At that time, the Chen Ping'an of then would still be Chen Ping'an, yet he would not be the same Chen Ping'an, for he would have become a fellow practitioner with the old master, drifting further from the path of Confucianism. Carrying one of the Lotus Flower Blessed Lands with you now is a reminder from the old master for me to be more patient and accommodating with you."

The little Daoist boy nodded, suddenly enlightened, "That makes some sense."

Daoist Sun chuckled, "One dares to speak nonsense, the other dares to pretend to understand. You two make a perfect pair."

Lu Chen did not take this to heart.

The little Daoist boy's right hand reached into his left sleeve, where a phoenix leaf was hidden.

This was indeed one of the locations of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Divided into four, one portion was taken by a disciple of the old scholar who had a closed-door disciple who lost his memory and later encountered a young scholar from an official family in the Northern Jin Kingdom, accompanied by a little white monkey.

Lu Chen occupied one of them.

In the history of the Songso Kingdom, Yu Zhenyi, the first true practitioner of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, had his blessed land taken to the Lotus Flower Cave by the old master. That Yu Zhenyi, who received the Dao Ancestor's great prophecy to "Stay in the mortal world for a thousand years, always with the complexion of a youth," must surely have great fortune by his side. The little Daoist boy was somewhat envious.

The little Daoist boy hesitated for a long time, then pulled out an iron ring from his sleeve and handed it to the rather unserious Lu Chen, who had a rather casual demeanor in his actions, speech, and cultivation.

It should be noted that Lu Chen hailed from the Great Integrity World, as the first to "depart from the classics and rebel," even mocking the Sage of the First Teacher in his writings through allegories.

The little Daoist boy had a good relationship with the old scholar, yet he was not familiar with the Confucian Temple at all, so he was not keen on dealing with those seemingly rigid and conservative sages. Moreover, he had heard Lu Chen mention that the peculiarities of this realm were not few, yet it was vast, and one should be careful of being seen as food by those peculiarities while traveling alone.

Lu Chen gripped the iron ring, squatted a bit, posed like a martial artist sinking his energy into his dantian, then spun around, one foot on the ground, the other raised, leaning forward as he forcefully tossed the iron ring, transforming it into a brilliant rainbow that pierced the air towards the Confucian Sage stationed at the celestial curtain.

The little Daoist boy stretched his neck and reminded, "Be careful not to throw it off course, causing the Confucian Sage to have a hard time finding it."

Daoist Sun laughed, "Shouldn’t we be worried about whether this thing will hit the Confucian Sage on the head? A scholar values their reputation above all; if the Confucian Temple holds you accountable later, it’ll be your fault. Lu Chen can just run away, but where would you take that blessed land?"

The little Daoist boy awkwardly chuckled, "It shouldn’t come to that."

He glared at Lu Chen with determination.

Lu Chen nodded, "Just keep your heart steady and your hands precise; point where you need to go, and there will be no chance of missing."

Daoist Sun nodded, "Wherever you point, it shall strike."

The little Daoist boy increasingly felt guilty, glancing between Lu Chen, who was helping him, and Daoist Sun, who was speaking for him, and wasn't quite sure.

Daoist Sun shook his head.

This firewood boy was really a little fool. The iron ring flew far away, traveling thousands of miles, and the residual aura along its trajectory was enough to allow Lu Chen to further refine the fortune of the mountains and rivers.

This made Daoist Sun miss the Chen Daoist he had encountered in the Northern Jiulu Continent.

That was someone who truly would think deeply about things and was indeed worthy of the old master of the East Sea's long-term schemes.

Recalling those years, they had met on the mountain, each treating the other with sincerity in times of hardship, leading to a bond that allowed for a peaceful parting.

"Friend Chen, one must be generous in life."

"Daoist Sun, fairness must be upheld in transactions!"

At this moment, Daoist Sun stroked his beard and laughed, finding this sharp-minded young man quite likable. But the path they traversed was too barren. Fortunately, at the moment of parting, the last heartfelt "Daoist Sun, Daoist Sun," made up for it.

The previously silent Shan Qing suddenly asked, "Senior brother, may I travel alone?"

Lu Chen smacked his forehead, smiling wryly, "What’s the point of asking about this from a fellow junior? Are you saying that if you’re not in the Azure Sky Realm, you can’t walk out a hundred feet?"

Daoist Sun stroked his beard and smiled, "Daoist Lu, congratulations on finding a good junior brother."

Shan Qing bowed to his senior brother and Daoist Sun, then took a step, crossing a hundred feet, and as he rode the wind, he broke through to the Jade Purity Realm.

Almost simultaneously, a young Buddhist disciple from the west also broke through.

Lu Chen nodded and shook his wrist, "That’s good; that was a close one."

Daoist Sun smiled and said, "Why make it hard on yourself, Daoist Lu? Just tell me next time; it’s just a slap’s worth of trouble, who wouldn’t fight?"

The little Daoist boy, worried, asked, "Lu Sect Leader, how did you know I would lend the 'Doubled Measure' gourd to the Confucian Temple later? My master cast an illusion spell himself, and you don’t know about the Tongye Continent’s affairs..."

Lu Chen laughed, "Holding a high position and having nothing to do each day, isn’t it just natural to let my imagination run wild, guessing here and there?"

The little Daoist boy reached back to touch the enormous golden gourd.

Lu Chen continued, "This 'Doubled Measure' gourd, from the old master to you, the sages of this place, the scholars of the Middle Earth Confucian Temple, and the embroidered tiger of Bao Pingzhou, all traveling through, will ultimately end up in the hands of a girl with the surname Li."

The little Daoist boy frowned, "Is that another one of your wild guesses?"

He was somewhat reluctant about this parting, even though the "Doubled Measure" would certainly be returned later.

Lu Chen laughed, "Have you ever considered who the original owner of those seven sword-holding gourds was?"

A single vine bore seven gourds, ultimately stemming from a singular point in the Great Integrity World.

Seven threads of fate intertwined into one.

The Dao Ancestor idly observed this, akin to watching a pool of lotus flowers bloom and wither, or where the drops of water fall, it is the same principle.

Though the Dao Ancestor’s methods transcend the heavens, he wouldn’t disrupt these roots that had taken hold in the Great Integrity World.

The little Daoist boy replied, "Of course, and then?"

Daoist Sun smiled, "It’s like playing music to cattle, or talking to a duck."

This was essentially a double insult.

Lu Chen replied helplessly, "Daoist Sun, I still respect my masters and the Dao."

Daoist Sun looked puzzled, "What are you saying? I’m getting old and muddled; my ears aren’t what they used to be."

Lu Chen merely smiled it off.

After all, his master didn’t care, so as a disciple, he didn’t need to meddle.

Only the little Daoist boy, who was muddled, was left in confusion.

He only knew that the vine planted by the Dao Ancestor had borne the best seven sword-holding gourds in the world.

The gourd vine that grew in the Inverted Mountain’s Spring Banner Hall, which was nurtured and produced by the sword immortal Shao Yunyan, could not compare at all.

This enormous golden gourd behind the little Daoist boy, being one of the rarest seven sword-holding gourds in the world, was named "Doubled Measure," filled with countless waters from the East Sea. It was said that the surface water of the entire East Sea had dropped several feet. However, the old master had not allowed him to cultivate swords, instead using it to catch and nurture flood dragons. Especially before "ascending" to the Azure Sky Realm, the old master secretly accomplished a great deed.

When Li Liu and Gu Can reunited at the Dragon Resting Stone in the sea, not even a single flood dragon had come to rain or rest, and this was because the flood dragons in the sea on both sides of Tongye Continent had almost all been captured by the old Daoist. Many flood dragons from other sea areas had also actively entered the "Doubled Measure." The flood dragon gorge located between the Inverted Mountain and the Rain Dragon Sect didn’t need to stop at the Dragon Resting Stone.

The Confucian Sage had not obstructed this matter, of course, for his own reasons.

In addition, the six other invaluable sword-holding gourds each nurtured the most swords, known as "Cow Hair." The name wasn’t great, but the rank and might were quite intimidating. They were most helpful in gaining favors from sword cultivators and sword immortals on the mountains.

The fastest to form the embryo of the destined sword was named "Zhongnan Mountain Road." The better the quality of the sword cultivator, the more destined swords they would have. Once they possessed this sword-holding gourd, it would be most complementary.

The sword nurtured to the greatest toughness had a peculiar name, just one word, "Three."

The most unmatched in sharpness, capable of breaking through myriad laws with a single sword, was called "Heart’s Desire," a wish fulfilled.

The smallest, quickest sword could be refined to truly formless, ignoring the river of time, named "Immediate."

And the one most able to nourish its master’s physique, suitable for holding wine, for cultivators drinking wine is actually absorbing sword energy, and it poses no risk. It was named "Fine Wine," symbolizing the beauty of life, the first of fine wines.

In total, there were seven sword-holding gourds, and for some reason, they had all remained in the Great Integrity World.

The small Bao Pingzhou was particularly blessed, possessing two, one of which, the purple-gold sword-holding gourd "Cow Hair," had once been given to a female sword cultivator named Su Jia, who was much anticipated by her sect.

Of course, it was not an ancestral item from Bao Pingzhou, as Bao Pingzhou didn’t have such a background; it was acquired midway.

The Wind and Snow Temple also had a white sword-holding gourd, which was early obtained by Wei Jin, who had reached the upper five realms of sword immortality by forty. The little Daoist boy speculated it was the "Fine Wine."

Additionally, the eldest disciple of the city lord of the White Emperor City in Central Earth had obtained a "Three." The financial deity of the Ai Ai Continent, half bought and half seized, managed to obtain a "Zhongnan Mountain," which had been treasured for a long time, never shown lightly. It was said to be one of the betrothal gifts for Liu Youzhou, the future son-in-law.

The great sword immortal Bai Chang from the Northern Jiulu Continent had obtained the "Zhongnan Mountain Road."

However, the two most suitable for sword cultivators in combat, "Heart’s Desire" and "Immediate," had remained elusive.

The little Daoist boy wanted to regain some dignity, so he jokingly said, "Lu Sect Leader, would you like to meet a descendant of the Lu family?"

Lu Chen seemed to ponder the thought for a moment, finding it amusing.

Lu Chen smiled, "A child who couldn’t even light the incense of the Three Pure Ones on Inverted Mountain doesn’t need to be met."

Daoist Sun gazed into the distance, marveling, "What a bold Shan Qing, indeed quite interesting."

While claiming to travel far, it seemed he was actually heading toward a newly occupied mountain peak of Xuandu Temple, as if he intended to eliminate all the Daoists below the Yuan Ying level.

Lu Chen exclaimed, "This is out of line, really! Aren’t you afraid that little junior brother will be beaten to death by Daoist Sun?"

Daoist Sun nodded, "Driving a dog into a corner forces it to jump over the wall."

Since Daoist Sun himself said this, Lu Chen had nothing more to say.

Daoist Sun then scoffed, "That’s the theory, but is it really so easy to kill? They have countless treasures on them, and even with a boost to their combat prowess, what does it matter? The sword immortals of Xuandu Temple, while not as wealthy as the little immortals of White Jade Capital, still have some skill in combat."

A young monk from the west was nearly simultaneously breaking through.

A young female sword cultivator from Xuandu Temple was slightly slower in breaking through.

Yet, having drawn swords against the incoming Shan Qing, she possessed the strength to fight. While victory was unlikely, delaying Shan Qing for a moment would suffice.

When Xuandu Temple cultivators went down the mountain to act, they either faced conflict with a calm demeanor, accepting insults without striking back, or they would directly engage, and it would always be to the death.

Additionally, the Daoists of Xuandu Temple… loved calling their fellow sect members or friends to surround their enemies.

Thus, the Daoists of Xuandu Temple below the upper five realms had often experienced great scenes.

Of course, once they reached the upper five realms, they shouldn’t act so openly, as per the words of the old ancestor; it would not reflect well if word got out.

As for what happened in private, Daoist Sun had traveled outside for many years, unable to see or hear, and of course, had no control over it. "I take in disciples, and my disciples take in their own disciples; I will only pass on the Dao techniques and swordsmanship. Whether you bring honor or shame to Xuandu Temple on your travels, that’s up to you."

In fact, Daoist Sun had always been indifferent about minor matters. 

He had a saying: "I have achieved success in practicing the Dao, so I remain calm and unruffled."

The old master only managed the major affairs.

Thus, he had another saying: "I have diligently practiced swordsmanship in this life, so am I reasoning with fools?"

Lu Chen had indeed been calculating since the opening of the two great gates in the Fifth Realm.

Daoist Sun asked, "Are you that worried about the Great Integrity World?"

Lu Chen smiled, "After setting up my fortune-telling stall in Li Zhu Cave for many years, it’s only natural to have a few concerns."

Daoist Sun shook his sleeves, raised his hand, and calculated with his fingers, exclaiming, "How coincidental. I never expected that after Daoist Lu traveled to other lands for a few years, you would have such deep connections with causality. I also didn’t anticipate that as we walked our separate paths, without ever crossing paths, there would still be some intersecting fates. However, mine is a good fate, while yours is a bad one; I can’t help but worry for you."

Lu Chen agreed, "Indeed worrying."

After all, Cao Ci was only at the peak stage now.

Back then, he had returned to his hometown in the world, setting up a stall in that small town to tell fortunes, but sadly, all he had was a literary sparrow to assess the literary fortunes. If only he had a martial sparrow, Qi Jingchun’s illusion would have no effect.

Lu Chen shook his sleeves, no longer calculating.

Daoist Sun was still calculating within his sleeves, smiling, "Can’t Daoist Lu no longer hold on?"

Lu Chen replied irritably, "Master, please stop pretending."

Daoist Sun laughed heartily, shaking his sleeves. Even if it was just a show, it counted as a win over Lu Chen.

Lu Chen sighed, "With the opening of this realm, the five realms are now interconnected."

The Great Integrity World, Azure Sky Realm, and Lotus Flower Realm had all been connected by doors, while the Wild Realm had opened its doors to the Great Integrity World.

Daoist Sun reined in his smile, nodding, "That’s the hardest part."

They fell into silence.

Along with a firewood boy who understood nothing of the Dao.

Lu Chen casually remarked, "It’s a pity I can’t meet that Frostfall Daoist’s companion; it truly is a great regret."

"That’s just a half of Frostfall Daoist’s companion at most," Daoist Sun sighed, "The world is merely entangled by love. Frostfall Daoist goes against the flow to bind her beloved, deeply infatuated yet ruthless. Outsiders can’t judge right from wrong."

Wu Shuangjiang, the most renowned cultivator in the history of the Year-End Palace, single-handedly raised a second-rate sect to become a top sect in the Azure Sky Realm.

After he established himself, a large group of prodigies, including the Year-End Keepers, began to rise.

And Wu Shuangjiang himself was once among the top ten in the Azure Sky Realm. Although his ranking was not high, being in the top ten of the entire realm still held some power.

This person could have broken through the bottleneck of the Ascendant Realm but chose to remain in seclusion.

Because Wu Shuangjiang had not shown himself for far too long, he had fallen out of the top ten hundreds of years ago.

The little Daoist boy was most interested in this mountain-top secret and curiously asked, "If Wu Shuangjiang were to fight openly, unleashing all his techniques, could he defeat the two of you?"

Lu Chen smiled, "Practicing the Dao is precisely to avoid fighting, isn’t it?"

Daoist Sun nodded in agreement, "It shouldn’t just be about fighting."

The little Daoist boy scoffed. What were the Daoists of White Jade Capital and the sword immortals doing at this moment?

Lu Chen stood on his toes, observing the flow of fortune in this world, suddenly stating, "The first is without a doubt?"

Daoist Sun replied, "You should be thankful that it wasn’t Chen Daoist who arrived here. Otherwise, in the future, it would be very possible for a sword challenge to occur, leading to a clash of two realms."

Lu Chen smiled, "You’re mistaken; if he came here, he would only become more restricted, and the Dao would come to a halt."

Daoist Sun stroked his beard, nodding, "That is also true."

The little Daoist boy muttered softly, "Can you two discuss something I can understand?"

Lu Chen replied, "Difficult."

Daoist Sun added, "Extremely difficult."

In the central region of this realm, two Confucian sages sat at the Heavenly Gate, one from the lineage of the Sage of Rites, and the other from the lineage of the Sub-Sage, both serving as accompany sages of the Confucian Temple.

One recorded all that he saw and heard, while the other focused on the eastern and western gates, preventing upper five realm cultivators from sneaking in and forbidding Nascent Soul cultivators from entering through the northern and southern gates.

Each sage brought along a disciple of their lineage, both of whom were gentlemen of the academic institutions.

Among them, one gentleman bore a long sword named "Great Integrity," which was gifted by a friend during his early travels to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

These two gentlemen, due to their connections with the sages, could observe the mountains and rivers and view the world, experiencing many curious events.

For instance, among the three thousand Daoists, one leading figure from one of the talisman sect's ancestral courts, known as Nan Shan, was a Yuan Ying cultivator.

His rival, the Harvest Mountain, also had a Yuan Ying cultivator, a woman named You Ran.

This couple not only shared the same birth year and month but even the same hour, down to the minute.

In addition, the two gentlemen were also aware of many matters regarding the Azure Sky Realm.

These had not been recorded in previous texts by the sages.

The Great Integrity World had ten types of rogue cultivators, including seamstresses and the lone rider of the South Sea, all defined as evil paths to be eradicated.

Meanwhile, the Azure Sky Realm also had ten types of cultivators who were not favored. They were not to the point of being treated like vermin, but they certainly wouldn’t dare approach the territory of White Jade Capital.

These included rice thieves, corpse-resolving immortals, the Red Soft Hand who rolls up curtains, porters, coffin bearers, mountain patrollers, beauty officials, blade-handlers, and the one-word masters, the exiled ones.

This time, as the three thousand Daoists entered this new realm, beyond the shares of the major sects, there were also hundreds of "mountain and wild cultivators" from the Azure Sky Realm. By chance, they had acquired a jade token issued by White Jade Capital to gain passage through the realms.

Meanwhile, within and around the city of the sword cultivators, after Ning Yao achieved the Jade Purity Realm, even though she intentionally distanced herself from the city to travel alone, the Yuan Ying sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, including Qi Shou, were slightly suppressed by the great paths of heaven and earth. Especially Qi Shou, who was the most likely to break through after Ning Yao, found his own breakthrough delayed, as Ning Yao not only broke through but advanced rapidly within the Jade Purity level, causing Qi Shou’s progress to lag behind the likes of Shan Qing, the western Buddhist disciple, and the Xuandu Temple female cultivator, who were all favored by the heavens.

As the world began, many great paths manifested clearly, showing significant influence and becoming increasingly obvious. Afterward, it would become more and more vague.

However, with Qi Shou’s exceptional talent and the potential benefits of being the leader of the Executioner lineage, he would undoubtedly become the first of the second batch of Jade Purity Realm cultivators within ten years.

The so-called first batch was actually just Ning Yao.

Following that would be the second batch, including Shan Qing, the western Buddhist disciple, and Qi Shou, totaling no more than ten.

The third batch would consist of various cultivators who would ascend to the upper five realms within the next ninety years.

The cultivators from Tongye and Fuyou Continents would still not be numerous, as compared to the eastern and western gates, the southern and northern regions of the Fifth Realm would only allow a few Yuan Ying cultivators to enter. Those few Yuan Ying cultivators were exceptions, as their sects’ merits and their own dispositions had gained the approval of the Confucian Temple of the Middle Earth. For example, the female cultivator of Taiping Mountain and the sword cultivator Huang Ting. Including her, without exception, they had all been sent here at their sects' insistence, prepared for the possibility of their sects being destroyed and everyone dying, relying on one person to continue the incense for the ancestral hall.

The current year was already at the end of the fifth year of the Jia Chun era.

Before this, there had been some debate about whether the year name should be Jia Chun or the one suggested by the Confucian Temple. In the end, Jia Chun was finalized just recently, which meant that before this, both names had been used concurrently. The old scholar had one, and the Confucian Temple had another, with neither side willing to concede. It was a rare occasion when Bai Ye spoke up, breaking his silence, declaring that he found the two characters "Jia Chun" beautiful, and the implication was even more beautiful. After all, he held a sword to his neck every day; as a fallen scholar, he dared not disobey.

Besides, there was much debate about which year should be defined as the first year—whether it was the year when the old scholar and Bai Ye entered the new realm or when the city of the Sword Qi Great Wall landed, which led to another argument.

Naturally, it was the old scholar who won both debates, as Bai Ye first paved the way with his sword, and later, the merits of opening the heavens with his sword were simply too significant. In this process, the old scholar also did not idle, working diligently to establish many things, such as securing the mountains and rivers. Thus, the Confucian Temple somewhat agreed to give the old scholar "some face." However, everyone understood deep down that the one deemed the most successful scholar, Bai Ye, would not get involved in the matter of the year name. Nor would he dare to hold a sword to the old scholar’s neck? It would be hard to say who was holding the sword to whose neck.

As for the first year of Jia Chun, the final determination of when the city landed would be a disputed matter that would be settled later. The old scholar left the Fifth Realm not long after, feeling quite smug as he visited the Confucian Temple, strutting arrogantly, his sleeves fluttering. It turned out the old scholar had secretly stolen the ancestral scroll of the "World's Search for Mountains" from Bai Ze. Initially, the Confucian Temple hoped to use the moment when the old scholar and Bai Ye entered the new realm as the first year of Jia Chun, but when the old scholar arrived, he sacrificed all his merits just to exchange for a portion of the great Dao's fortune protection for that city. Moreover, the "World's Search for Mountains" scroll, which the old scholar did not keep for himself but gave to Nan Po Sha Continent, left the Confucian Temple without any grounds to argue.

At that time, the Confucian Temple had closed its doors, and the old scholar had a fierce argument with the deputy head of the Confucian Temple, the grand sacrificial offerings of the academy, and the heads of various schools in the Central Earth.

Later, the Sub-Sage arrived, and even the Sage of Rites showed up.

The old scholar directly stated that scholars should not only argue behind closed doors but also close the study doors. Otherwise, he wouldn’t fear bringing shame to the literary world, but each of you was a scholar and a master of literature, which would bring great dishonor to the literary world and leave the juniors laughing at them. So, in the end, except for the three, all left the Confucian Temple's gates and obediently stood outside in the square waiting for news.

In the end, the two deputy heads, three grand sacrificial offerings, and more than ten heads of various schools witnessed a scene where three sages emerged from the Confucian Temple together. Originally, the old scholar and the Sub-Sage walked alongside the Sage of Rites, but unexpectedly, the old scholar casually slowed his pace, brushed past the Sub-Sage, and walked boldly in the center. Fortunately, the Sage of Rites smiled, and the Sub-Sage did not blame him. Thus, the old scholar was allowed to surpass the rules this one time.

However, the old scholar remained the old scholar, not regaining his identity as a literary sage, and the statue of the Sage would not be moved back into the Confucian Temple for worship alongside the Sage of the First Teacher.

Eventually, everyone dispersed.

Only the old scholar sat on the steps, as if chatting about trivial matters with someone.

The old scholar, while complaining, never showed a worried expression.

Moreover, on that day, the old scholar complained a lot, but he also boasted more.

An old man revered as the Sage of the First Teacher sat next to the old scholar.

The elder wished to leave to attend to important matters, but he was tightly grasped by the old scholar's sleeve, unable to depart.

The elder could only gently tug at his sleeve, signaling that it was about time.

The old scholar turned sideways, holding onto the sleeve with both hands, "Let’s talk a bit longer! We haven’t even discussed how my closed-door disciple went to the Sword Qi Great Wall to find a wife. You don’t know, that closed-door disciple of mine is the culmination of all my teachings, and when it comes to finding a wife, he surpasses any of his seniors, shining brighter than the blue!"

The elder helplessly responded, "Bai Ye's sword was quite polite."

Within the southern gate, the Confucians had set up two mountain and water prohibitions. Once one entered the Fifth Realm and crossed the second boundary, they could only exit but not return.

Ning Yao rode her sword through the air, arriving thousands of miles away and gazing at the towering gateway that stood between heaven and earth.

As long as she used her sword to break the prohibition, she could cross the gate to Tongye Continent.

However, in the end, Ning Yao turned to leave.

Ultimately changing her mind, she sheathed her sword, placing it behind her, and landed on the ground.

Dressed in a golden robe with a sword immortal behind her, Ning Yao intended to ask several Tongye cultivators for the latest happenings.

A group of over ten people rode the wind, distancing themselves from the gate, all being Dragon Gate and Golden Dan realm cultivators. 

From their initial panic on the escape route, upon arriving here, they formed alliances, realizing that they had gained fortune from misfortune; for them, the world was now vast and free. The reasoning was simple; there were no Yuan Ying cultivators nearby!

Moreover, in this realm, there were no upper five realms!

Three Golden Dan cultivators from the Nine Dragon Gate; was it difficult to kill a Yuan Ying?

In truth, it wasn’t easy, as paper strength is merely an abstraction; if even one or two Yuan Ying cultivators were to be slain, the others would be intimidated, leading them to fight separately, and in the end, it would become a situation where everyone surrounded one, or a single individual hunted down everyone—who would kill whom was truly hard to say.

But now, with the vast heavens and earth, there were no Yuan Ying left.

What mountain-seeking realms and cave dwelling realms could they even compare to? Those over thirty cultivators from various sects and royal families were currently gathering forces by the gate.

This dozen had previously agreed to establish the largest "sect" on the mountain, competing for people, territory, influence, and fortune, striving to seize everything for themselves!

Afterward, even if their cultivation potential was limited, they would use mountains of celestial money to break through their respective bottlenecks. As long as one among the twelve broke through to the Yuan Ying realm first, a solid legacy would be established.

Then they noticed the woman walking with a sword on the ground.

Everyone was slightly surprised; did she have the courage to travel alone?

Upon closer inspection, each had their own intentions—some were attracted to her beauty, some to the seemingly high-quality robe she wore, some speculated about the value of the long sword on her back, and others had murderous intentions, while there were also those who were cautious and reluctant to provoke trouble. Of course, there was one lone female cultivator, a Golden Dan, who pitied the poor woman’s situation. Save her? Why? She had no desire for that. In this chaotic world where only cultivators mattered, if one looked so good but lacked a high cultivation level, how could they dare to venture out alone? Wasn’t that courting death?

Ning Yao looked up and, seeing that they had no intention of acting, continued on her way.

The twelve refugees from Tongye Continent hovered in the air, looking down at the temporarily unknown beautiful woman below. 

Moments later, the Golden Dan female cultivator grew irritated; were these big men all so self-disciplined and virtuous? None of them were moving at all?

So she smiled and said, "I find that girl quite decent; don’t compete with me for her. I could use a maid, and she’ll do."

As soon as she spoke, a burly man with fiery eyes reached out to embrace the slender waist of the female cultivator beside him, grinning, "Being a maid is good, but being a concubine maid is even better. Big brother will help you take down that lucky girl right now. My dear jade-cheeked sister, let’s quickly find an auspicious day to marry; who knows, we might become the first couple in this realm. What if we gain some mysterious additional fortune along the way? Wouldn’t that be a doubly good thing..."

In between his words, the man spoke in secret to his two friends, "Remember to support me; I don’t trust anyone else, including this jade-cheeked hussy."

The man took out a military talisman and donned the divine armor in a flash, then descended to the ground, striding toward the sword-wielding woman, smiling, "Miss, where are you from in the Tongye Continent? How about we travel together? More people means less fear, right?"

Seemingly lighthearted banter, but he had already tightly gripped the long knife in his hand; he was a seasoned warrior in the Golden Dan realm.

Ning Yao’s expression remained indifferent as she replied, "More people means less fear of death?"

She used a somewhat awkward version of Tongye’s formal language.

In terms of linguistic talent, she was indeed better than him—she could speak the elegant languages of the three continents, the official dialects of various nations, and many local dialects. She intentionally used a nonchalant expression, speaking words in a language he wouldn’t understand.

But she understood what he was saying because she could read his eyes.

The man laughed heartily, "Miss has quite the sense of humor..."

From the center of his brow, he suddenly split in half from head to toe.

A set of divine armor and a Golden Dan warrior’s physique proved to be no match for a mere sheet of paper.

The female cultivator known as Jade Cheek was aware of the impending danger and also found herself cut in half by an invisible sword energy; her Golden Dan was enveloped by her soul, spinning around, just as she was about to escape, it shattered with a bang.

Ning Yao glanced at the sky.

Ten cultivators rushed forward, each wishing to dive straight into the ground, eager to be the first to meet that sword immortal woman.

It was not because they recognized her as a sword cultivator; in truth, they had no idea how she had made her move. But since she carried a sword, she was assumed to be a sword immortal.

Regardless of whether she was an astonishing Golden Dan sword cultivator or some Yuan Ying sword cultivator who had fallen from the sky, she was still a sword immortal! Killing them would be as easy as chopping down a bunch of chicks.

Ning Yao suddenly lost interest in inquiring about the situation in Tongye Continent.

He had once shared tales of his journeys through Tongye Continent’s mountains and rivers with her, and the book he always carried also contained writings about it.

But Ning Yao knew that the genuine Tongye cultivators who should come to this realm had not yet arrived.

Thus, Ning Yao turned to leave.

She planned to walk for a while and, on the way back, she noticed a mountain not far ahead, abundant with a peculiar green bamboo, intending to craft a walking stick.

As she turned, the man who had previously communicated with his two friends using his thoughts suddenly met his demise.

In front of a peak stage sword cultivator, their whispered conversations, full of self-assuredness, had proven to be far too careless.

A young-looking sword cultivator floated to the ground, frowning, "Friend, are you not being too heavy-handed?"

The remaining eight cultivators exchanged glances, each with their own thoughts.

This sword cultivator was exceptionally renowned, recognized as the successor of the Xianqing Sect in Tongye Continent, named Nie Yun. At a hundred years old, he had reached the Golden Dan stage, and crucially, he was also a sword cultivator.

The reason he could identify the person’s identity at a glance was due to the conspicuous sword "Corpse Resolution" hanging at his waist, which radiated with colorful glimmers, indicating it was a semi-immortal weapon that recognized its master!

His name had been given by the sect's ancestor when he was brought into the sect as a child, implying that this child had the potential to ascend to the skies.

Ning Yao ignored him.

The young sword cultivator distanced himself from the woman, walking alongside her.

Ning Yao said, "With blind eyes and deaf ears and a low realm, it’s best to speak less and stay away."

Nie Yun chuckled, "Are you saying I can’t judge people’s hearts? That’s not the case; it’s just that apart from Xu Yao and Jade Cheek, the two Golden Dan cultivators, the others do not deserve to die. A lesson will suffice. As long as they’re not wicked villains, we cultivators of Tongye Continent should abandon past grievances, focus on our cultivation, and elevate ourselves. Perhaps we will encounter the cultivators of Fuyou Continent soon, or even those sword-cultivating brutes from the Sword Qi Great Wall..."

Initially, he hadn’t thought much of it, but as he approached and saw her, he realized she was indeed captivating.

Naturally, this wasn’t a matter of lust; for a young genius with a pure heart for the sword, he simply found her to be someone who set him apart from the mundane.

Ning Yao’s gaze remained focused ahead as she said, "The habit of not heeding advice will need to be corrected after a fall."

Nie Yun was about to speak.

In an instant, he was sent flying, a significant portion of his Golden Dan shattered, and he bled from all seven orifices, struggling to rise.

His vision blurred, he vaguely saw the figure of the woman receding in the distance.

The remaining eight stared at each other in shock.

Should they take the opportunity to kill and seize the "Corpse Resolution," or save him, forming a significant connection with the Xianqing Sect?

Almost everyone at the Xianqing Sect, apart from the two Yuan Ying ancestors, had already entered this new realm.

It was said that even the ancestral hall's statues and deities were carried by Nie Yun in some ancestral relic.

One disciple ground his teeth and shared his thoughts, "What’s this incense connection? It’s all nonsense. Who cares about this now? Who among us isn’t a mountain and wild cultivator? If we obtain a semi-immortal weapon, whoever among us breaks through to the Yuan Ying realm first will take it. We’ll all swear an oath that whoever obtains 'Corpse Resolution' will take the lead, and this person must ensure that everyone else breaks through a level!"

Another reminded, "But 'Corpse Resolution' is a semi-immortal weapon that recognizes its master; who dares to take it? Who can refine it? If Nie Yun were to perish, it would be fine; otherwise, if he doesn’t die..."

One person whispered, "Nie Yun’s fall, yet we haven’t seen the 'Corpse Resolution' drawn. The recognition of a master is likely a ploy by the Xianqing Sect to build his reputation."

There were also a few who were reluctant to engage in risky actions, yet they didn’t wish to voice their concerns. Blocking opportunities from the mountains was even more hated than obstructing people’s financial paths.

Unexpectedly, when no one dared to make the first move, Nie Yun sat up, and the sword "Corpse Resolution" flew out of its sheath, hovering in the air. He reached for the sword’s body, feeling no harm in his palm, as if the sword was helping him stand.

Nie Yun’s eyes darkened as he glared at those worthless fools; even if he were truly deaf, he was not blind and could discern their expressions and gazes!

He released the semi-immortal weapon, "Corpse Resolution," swaying unsteadily but showing no fear of the crowd, grinding his teeth, "A bunch of worthless trash, just a broken Golden Dan cultivator who knows a little about talismans dares to kill me for my sword?"

Nie Yun suddenly bowed his head, gazing at his beloved sword, tears streaming down his face, "Why did you pretend to be dead earlier? Why didn’t you come out on your own? Why didn’t you protect my Golden Dan? Instead of killing her, you could’ve protected my Golden Dan as well..."

The long sword trembled, almost like it was weeping in lament.

It seemed to feel more aggrieved than its master, who had just fallen.

It couldn’t leave its sheath.

Afraid its master would die.

But as with all semi-immortal weapons, they were often like naive, uncomprehending children; they could neither speak nor write.

Otherwise, this "Corpse Resolution" would have clearly understood that the woman before them was likely the first person recognized by the great Dao of this realm.

Finally, the eight cultivators realized that the semi-immortal weapon "Corpse Resolution" was fully capable of killing on its own, so without hesitation, they each used their techniques to flee.

Nie Yun, however, had no intention of pursuing them. One, he had suffered this calamity and was in a state of confusion; two, after falling, there were too many uncertainties, and he did not wish to provoke further complications.

He had already remembered the faces and attire of the eight, knowing the general backgrounds of several cultivators. The green mountains would remain unchanged, and there would eventually be opportunities to meet again.

This young genius, who carried the hopes of his sect, lifted his gaze toward the direction the woman had gone, suddenly realizing that she came from the Sword Qi Great Wall!

Ning Yao arrived at a green mountain bamboo grove, searching around. Finally, she chose a lush green bamboo to craft a walking stick to carry.

Seeing no one around, Ning Yao began to practice walking with the stick, imagining the figure of that person leading the way in the mountains, picturing him traveling alone after reaching adulthood, imagining him drunk while drinking, envisioning him walking between mountains and rivers, wide-eyed at the scenery, planning to write it all down...

As she continued on, Ning Yao returned to her senses, standing on the peak of the green mountain, gently leaning on her walking stick, softly calling out a name, then listening intently to the sound of the wind rustling through the bamboo grove, which seemed to be responding.

Earlier, when she had just arrived in this new realm, her heart demon upon breaking through to the Yuan Ying realm was none other than Chen Ping'an in her heart.

For Ning Yao, the heart demon would only be like this.

But in just one encounter, after taking a few more glances, she swiftly ended his life.

Thus, breaking through was merely a moment.

Both complex and simple, at that moment, Ning Yao simply understood one thing: the Chen Ping'an in her heart was forever incomparable to the real Chen Ping'an; the world was vast, yet there was only one true Chen Ping'an, genuinely and unequivocally.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 820: New Wine Awaits Old Friends**

In the Central Land of the Divine Continent, at the Rites Academy (Li Ji Xue Gong).

A heavy winter snow had descended, and while the scholars and students of the academy were engaged in discussions about the Dao, Mao Xiaodong sat alone in a pavilion, admiring the falling snow. She gently rubbed her hands together, softly reciting a famous prose piece. The mountains and waters were blanketed in white, and the boats, fishermen, and wine drinkers were reduced to mere specks.

Mao Xiaodong did not feel at ease, however. The return of the Cliff Academy to the ranks of the Seventy-Two Academies had been delayed for years, and it still hadn’t been finalized. Now, with the construction of the Grand Lu’s capital and the opening of the Great Ditch on Baoping Continent already completed, it felt as if she were the one holding everyone back. If it weren't for her abysmal relationship with that Great Lu Embroidered Tiger, and her unwillingness to have any dealings with Cui Zhan, she would have already written to Cui Zhan, plainly stating that she was of little help and urging him to send someone more capable to oversee the situation. As long as the Cliff Academy could return to the proper lineage of the Temple of Literature, she would be grateful.

But Mao Xiaodong understood very well that writing a letter wouldn’t change anything. That bastard Cui Zhan had no sense of loyalty; he only cared about results. Since he chose to lead the expedition and then ceased to inquire further, it was clear he had his own plans.

While Cui Zhan could afford to wait, Mao Xiaodong was nearly on edge with impatience.

The situation on Tongye Continent had become chaotic. Daily reports circulated at the Rites Academy, detailing the wins and losses between Fuyou Continent and the demon army along the coastal battlefield. The cultivators from Fuyou Continent, especially those at the upper five realms, tried their best to choose battlegrounds overseas, avoiding the risk of collateral damage to the various kingdoms below, where armies had gathered. Aside from the courage of the upper five realm cultivators, the coordinated surprise attack by Qi Tingji, Zhou Shenzhi, and a recently ascended cultivator from Fuyou Continent was significant.

In contrast, Tongye Continent, which had initially adopted a defensive stance, faced a dismal situation. From the celestial beings atop the mountains to the secular dynasties, every front was on the verge of collapse. Now, they could only rely on the three major academies and those sects with “Zong” in their names to hold the line. The Yuguizong was somewhat stable in defense, while the Tongye Sect and the Fuji Sect faced some disorder. The coastal Fuji Sect’s territory was shrinking continuously. Only Taiping Mountain stood out; under the protection of its formidable array, it managed to send out a thousand cultivators who achieved considerable success, a feat that astonished many. The once-fallen Taiping Mountain’s Celestial Lord, with the support of the three barriers and the four symbols, now had a majestic presence, wielding a great mirror like a celestial being holding a bright moon, illuminating the surroundings. Under moonlight, the cultivators from Taiping Mountain advanced and retreated freely, dispatching enemies with ease.

Mao Xiaodong longed to abandon her role as deputy mountain master and head over to Old Dragon City to supervise the situation. Rather than staying here each day, helplessly watching, she’d rather take concrete action.

Accompanied by a large group of students from the academy, Mao Xiaodong had traveled across continents. As the deputy mountain master, she had to protect the students' focus on their studies, avoiding conflicts with the scholars from the academy, while also striving to regain the title of one of the Seventy-Two Academies for the Cliff Academy. Therefore, these years had not been easy for her. The critical issue was that the Great Lu Embroidered Tiger had not informed her of the methods to succeed, and upon arriving at the Rites Academy, the Grand Sacrificial Wine Master had also left her waiting for news, leaving her with no choice but to urge over thirty aspiring scholars, including Li Baoping, to calm down and study diligently.

Mao Xiaodong felt a sense of guilt because the key to whether they could rejoin the ranks of the Seventy-Two Academies depended largely on the mountain master’s own knowledge and abilities.

In the past, when her senior brother Qi Jingchun was alive, the Cliff Academy obtained this honor without difficulty. But now, with her in charge, she felt utterly powerless. Since returning to the Temple of Literature, if she could not rely on herself as the mountain master, then she had to depend on her students. However, in terms of student recruitment, whether it was the Cliff Academy in the capital of the Great Lu or its relocation in the Great Sui, they had always been unable to compete with the Guanh Lake Academy. Before the relocation, both the Cliff Academy and the Guanh Lake Academy were among the Seventy-Two, but the most talented students in Baoping Continent still preferred to try their luck at Guanh Lake Academy first, and only if they failed would they seek the Cliff Academy. This situation had left Mao Xiaodong and her fellow deputy mountain masters, including the former emperor of the Great Lu, quite resentful. Only Senior Brother Qi remained casual and composed, allowing the academy’s instructors to focus solely on teaching the same knowledge regardless of the students' backgrounds.

When Qi Jingchun served as mountain master, the Cliff Academy had a firm rule: every year, a group of impoverished students from local counties would be selected, even if their academic foundation was poor. The academy would still accept them each year, with Qi Jingchun personally teaching them. Consequently, many gifted students from wealthy families in Baoping Continent were reluctant to attend the Cliff Academy, not wanting to study alongside these impoverished students.

Mao Xiaodong remembered clearly that the former emperor of the Great Lu had once hinted to Senior Brother Qi, expressing that the Great Lu Academy was willing to accept these impoverished students, ensuring they would not be neglected or delayed. Moreover, the Great Lu’s officials would certainly pave a smooth path for them. The academy and its instructors would not have to worry. With Qi Jingchun’s knowledge, he could easily select the best students.

Senior Brother had once chuckled, saying that the Song family of the Great Lu would forget their roots too early.

This matter eventually fizzled out.

So, before heading to Liyu Cave, Senior Brother Qi Jingchun had no idea of any direct disciples, teaching equally both the sons of noble families with deep academic foundations and the impoverished students from rural areas.

Mao Xiaodong was actually quite familiar with the Rites Academy, having come here with the two seniors, Zuo and Qi Jingchun, for studies. However, the two seniors didn’t stay long and left her behind without so much as a goodbye, only leaving a letter in which Senior Brother Qi outlined the directions she should take in her studies, who to consult regarding learning methods, and which classic texts to focus on—words that were quite comforting.

Zuo, on the other hand, concluded his letter with a reminder for her not to worry if someone bullied her, and to just inform her seniors, remembering not to trouble the teachers, as they were busy.

How could Mao Xiaodong not worry? Aside from matters concerning the teacher’s knowledge, she dared not casually complain to Zuo and the others. Whenever Zuo chose to intervene, it was always the teacher who had to clean up the mess afterward. Moreover, the lineage of the Rites Academy had always maintained a friendly relationship with her teacher. Thus, back then, Mao Xiaodong could only grit her teeth and continue her studies here for several years.

Mao Xiaodong stepped out of the pavilion and looked at the couplets beneath the eaves.

**“Experience the world firsthand, then speak meaningfully.”**

**“When words and heart merge, only then does one taste the essence of books.”**

Turning, Mao Xiaodong saw Li Baoping approaching, dressed in a red cotton coat and holding a hiking staff.

As Li Baoping reached her side, Mao Xiaodong smiled softly, “Cutting class again?”

Li Baoping nodded, then shook her head, “I informed the teacher beforehand. I’m going to Younang Lake to admire the snow with Teacher Zhong and Sister Diezhuang.”

After leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang had separated from Cui Dongshan and Pei Qian, the former returning to Baoping Continent while the latter traveled through Nanposha Continent’s Chen clan, eventually reaching the Central Land of the Divine Continent. They learned that the mountain master and Li Baoping were studying here, so they chose to stop by the academy.

During this time, Chen Sanqiu and Diezhuang also arrived at the Rites Academy. Chen Sanqiu had already become a student of the academy, while Diezhuang was still waiting for someone. Coincidentally, the friend Diezhuang sought was said to be following a sage to the Fifth Heaven.

Mao Xiaodong chuckled, “What’s so great about Younang Lake? It should be called Flattery Lake instead, what a waste.”

Then, she whispered to Baoping, “These are just my personal opinions, just listen and forget about them. Don’t mention them outside.”

Li Baoping said, “I won’t casually comment on others’ writings or characters. Even if I do mention someone, I’ll discuss it alongside the academic doctrines of valuing elegance and rejecting superficiality. I won't just cling to ‘Younang’s water from the Milky Way, adding to the eternal cup,’ and get entangled with it. ‘Books observed through the ages,’ ‘Green waters meander away’—they are all excellent.”

Mao Xiaodong smiled and nodded, “Very good. The pursuit of knowledge and the way of life should be balanced and harmonious.”

Li Baoping hesitated for a moment before saying, “Mr. Mao, don’t worry too much.”

Earlier, she had seen Mr. Mao admiring the scenery alone from afar, which prompted her to come over and greet her mountain master.

Mao Xiaodong replied with a smile, “Worry is inevitable, but I won’t let it overwhelm me. You needn’t worry.”

Li Baoping then took her leave, heading off to reunite with Zhong Qiu, Cao Qinglang, and Sister Diezhuang to admire the snow at Younang Lake.

Chen Sanqiu was now a student of the academy and couldn’t afford to skip classes. Although he had read a lot at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he only realized how challenging it was to catch up upon arriving at the academy.

Moreover, Chen Sanqiu had become a student of the academy quite unexpectedly. Upon his arrival, a kindly old gentleman found him, chatted about the scenery, and it was only later that Chen Sanqiu learned the man was actually the Grand Sacrificial Wine Master of the academy. Thus, Chen Sanqiu studied diligently, and during his journey from Nanposha Continent to the Central Land, he had reached the Nascent Soul stage, giving him an edge over many who had not cultivated.

As for Diezhuang, she remained at her Golden Core bottleneck but felt no particular concern. After all, Chen Sanqiu was recognized as a promising student at the Sword Qi Great Wall, and his flying sword was inherently tied to literary luck, so it was only natural for him to break through. Besides, Diezhuang was now in a state of tension and sudden release. It seemed that after leaving the bloody battles of the Sword Qi Great Wall, she no longer knew what to do.

Thinking about the day she would reunite with that Confucian gentleman made Diezhuang nervous. The Fifth Heaven would not open for another hundred years, and only then could she and Chen Sanqiu visit that distant yet familiar place to meet Ning Yao and the others.

This was why Li Baoping often dragged Diezhuang around to unwind.

Mao Xiaodong watched them leave, a smile tugging at her lips. 

Li Baoping, in her red cotton coat, and the scholar Cao Qinglang, were all accustomed to carrying hiking staffs while traveling.

Mao Xiaodong stroked her beard and smiled, feeling a sense of relief. The burdens weighing down her heart seemed to lift gently, like snow landing softly on the ground.

No matter what, the legacy of her scholarly lineage would no longer be so precarious, as if it could vanish at any moment.

Mao Xiaodong held a good impression of Cao Qinglang, who was also a direct disciple of her junior brother Chen Pingan. By seniority, he ought to address her as “Master Uncle!”

In fact, when Cao Qinglang first met her, he had bowed and called her Master Uncle.

How could Mao Xiaodong not be happy?

Due to various circumstances, Li Baoping and Lin Shouyi could only call her Mountain Master or Mr. Mao. Moreover, Mao Xiaodong had not taken any direct disciples.

The young girl Pei Qian was ultimately a disciple of Chen Pingan’s martial arts, so for now, the only legitimate third-generation disciple recognized in the lineage of the Confucian Sage was Cao Qinglang.

This dignified elder turned to leave the pavilion, intending to read and enjoy a flask of wine at his quarters, his window open to the falling snow, a perfect combination.

Unexpectedly, someone called out from behind, “Xiaodong!”

Mao Xiaodong’s eyes filled with tears as she turned slowly, immediately bowing deeply and hesitating to rise, her voice trembling, “Student pays respects to you, Master!”

The old scholar waited for a moment, but seeing the student still did not rise, he sighed and stepped down the stairs to her side. The nearly shorter old scholar stood on his toes and patted his disciple's shoulder, “What’s all this? Master finally manages to put on a serious face, and you couldn’t even see it, wasting all my efforts to cultivate that teacher’s demeanor.”

Mao Xiaodong quickly straightened her posture, slightly hunching over in excitement, her teeth chattering with emotion. She respectfully called out again, “Master.”

It had been over a hundred years since she last saw her master.

Her master was not tall, but his knowledge towered high!

The old scholar nodded, “Three times is sufficient. Alright, Xiaodong, it’s really not that I blame you. Every time I see you bowing like that, I get anxious. Back then, I felt like I was paying respects to the dead.”

Mao Xiaodong felt guilty, “It’s the student’s fault.”

The old scholar helplessly said, “What’s wrong? It’s just that the Master is too lenient with the rules, and you, the student, are too particular about etiquette. It’s all good. Sigh, Xiaodong, you should really learn from your junior brother.”

Mao Xiaodong was at a loss and could only admit fault again.

The old scholar led Mao Xiaodong into the pavilion, and she kept bowing slightly as they walked together.

Finally seated across from her master, Mao Xiaodong straightened her back, sitting properly.

The old scholar was not angry that his disciple lacked insight; he only felt a bit pained.

Suddenly, the old scholar stood up, jumped, and spat outside, “A lifetime of knowledge resonates with the heavens; two sleeves of clear wind hold no possessions. The Younang Lake obtains the Milky Way water, its mouth contains the celestial decree to create a great lake… Ptooey!”

The old scholar had a decent impression of the person Mao Xiaodong and Li Baoping had previously discussed but had deep disdain for those later generations of scholars who fawned over him with poetry, wishing he could compile their verses into a book and toss it into some local temple, then ask that guy who was posthumously honored with the title of Wen Zhen Gong whether he felt embarrassed. Still, the man’s artistry and treatises were indeed not to be dismissed.

Mao Xiaodong remained composed, her heart as still as water.

After all, whatever Master said or did was right.

The old scholar sat back down and said, “The drunken wine from the Younang Lake is truly delicious and fairly priced, but the rule that gentlemen and virtuous men must pay half price is rather unfriendly. What’s with that? Scholars aren't just about fame and fortune.”

Mao Xiaodong remained silent, listening attentively to her master’s teachings.

The old scholar waited for a long time but could not get his student to bring up the recent debate regarding the Temple of Literature, feeling quite regretful. It was dull when he had to initiate the conversation himself.

Mao Xiaodong sat across, sincerely feeling that her master was unbothered by trivialities yet had accomplished great feats in the world.

The old scholar laughed, “Earlier, at the Sword Qi Great Wall’s tavern, I shared drinks with Zuo and your junior brother. Chen Pingan mentioned your teaching and imparting of knowledge, saying it resembled me, rich and harmonious. He also said you are cautious in your studies, teaching with great care.”

Mao Xiaodong quickly stood, “I’m not worthy of such praise.”

The old scholar said slowly, “If the disciple falls short of the master, then the next disciple must fall short of the current disciple. Is it really the case that the imparting of knowledge can only rely on the utmost sage to personally attend to everything? If you genuinely feel unworthy, then you truly are unworthy. True respect for teachers and the way of knowledge requires disciples to innovate and establish their own paths, which is the true essence of honoring teachers and cherishing knowledge. In my eyes, Mao Xiaodong, you should show me respect but also dare to point out any flaws in my teachings. Do you believe you have worked hard in your studies for a century, have any insights that surpass your master’s knowledge, or perhaps areas where my teachings could be improved? Even one would suffice.”

After standing up, Mao Xiaodong found it hard to sit down again, feeling immensely guilty. She shook her head, “Not at the moment.”

The old scholar surprisingly was not angry but rather appeared gentle, “Knowing oneself is not ignorance, and that is not entirely without use. Just keep at it.”

The old scholar paused for a moment and smiled, “After all, your master’s knowledge is still quite high.”

Mao Xiaodong stood there, in a dilemma—wanting to sit down to avoid towering over her master, yet wanting to stand by for teachings, as was proper.

The old scholar looked up at Mao Xiaodong and said with a smile, “You haven’t broken through the Nascent Soul bottleneck yet? That’s not good. With your temperament and knowledge, you should have broken through by now.”

Mao Xiaodong felt guilty again.

The old scholar asked, “What are the three basics of etiquette?”

Mao Xiaodong was about to speak when the old scholar raised his hand to point at his heart, “Answer yourself.”

The tall Mao Xiaodong stood in the pavilion, lost in thought.

The old scholar seemed to be speaking to himself, “The pavilion is like a resting place for the heart. Some worldly matters, like this wind and snow, with a few sage books in hand and knowledge of several wise principles, can one step outside the pavilion and not feel cold?”

The old scholar seemed to answer himself, “I believe it can make one feel a bit warmer, allowing one to walk a few more steps through the snow.”

Mao Xiaodong gazed at the heavy snow outside the pavilion and blurted out, “A gentleman’s learning beautifies his character; etiquette is how one corrects oneself. Words can be spoken, and actions can be taken. Learning should culminate in actions; this is the ultimate virtue of a gentleman.”

The old scholar clapped his thighs, saying, “Excellent!”

The wind and snow outside the pavilion seemed to still.

Mao Xiaodong slowly sat down, and as the snow ceased, she had already entered the Jade Purity stage. Moreover, the words on the couplets outside the pavilion shone brightly, and only then did the snow continue to fall upon the earth.

The old scholar suddenly asked, “Outside the pavilion, with your warm heart traversing far, what will you do about the many frozen hands and feet trembling by the roadside? These people may have never read a book, and in this cold season, they are all thinly clothed. How can they read? A teacher who no longer worries about his own warmth, whispering in the ears of those still shivering—wouldn’t that just annoy them?”

Mao Xiaodong fell into contemplation, so absorbed in her thoughts that she did not even notice her master’s quiet departure.

The old scholar laughed and spoke to the Grand Sacrificial Wine Master beside him, “What do you think?”

The Grand Sacrificial Wine Master replied, “Starting now, Cui Zhan has mentioned in a letter that as soon as Mao Xiaodong breaks through, he will take over as the new mountain master of the Cliff Academy.”

The old scholar chuckled, “Don’t forget to restore the Cliff Academy to the ranks of the Seventy-Two Academies.”

The latter nodded and returned to his duties.

The old scholar suddenly said, “Can I borrow a character from you, the character ‘Mountain’? If you refuse, I won’t hold it against you. I haven’t seen your master in a long time…”

The Grand Sacrificial Wine Master hesitated for a moment but decisively agreed.

The old scholar patted the other’s shoulder, praising, “Not muddled on small matters, and more decisive on significant ones. The Confucian Sage’s acceptance of disciples is just a notch below.”

In a moment, the esteemed Grand Sacrificial Wine Master found himself at a loss for words.

Conversing with the Confucian Sage and chatting with the old scholar represented two different worlds.

Li Baoping and the others had just exited the Rites Academy’s main gate.

Li Baoping suddenly smiled and said, “Old Mr. Confucian Sage.”

The old scholar, who only then revealed himself to them, waved his hand, signaling that they need not greet him, so as not to startle others. However, their conversation was quite casual.

Zhong Qiu, Cao Qinglang, and Diezhuang did not bow in greeting anymore. Cao Qinglang simply called out “Master Ancestor” and the old scholar nodded, grinning widely.

The old scholar walked with them toward Younang Lake, unnoticed by anyone along the way.

Li Baoping and her companions stepped on the snow, making crunching sounds.

Only the old scholar seemed to float along, leaving no trace.

After becoming one with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, he received the assistance of mountains and rivers, bearing the weight of heaven and earth.

A scholar was always like this; the old scholar took pride in his own works, gathering disciples, imparting knowledge, arguing with others, and his fondness for fine wines, without hiding his pride. Yet, in this one matter, he felt there was nothing worth boasting about; who praises or scolds whom, and who gets worked up over it?

The old scholar walked between Li Baoping and Cao Qinglang, glancing left and right, his face full of smiles.

**“Does my lineage of the Confucian Sage need many people?”**

With a grand wave, the old scholar dismissed the idea of needing numbers.

Li Baoping softly said, “Mr. Confucian Sage, I heard you have merged with the Dao of Heaven and Earth. You truly are a great man, standing tall.”

The old scholar instantly beamed with joy, waving his hand, “Where, where? I’m still fine.”

Li Baoping’s praises were something he would gladly accept.

Cao Qinglang chimed in, “Master Ancestor, you’ve worked hard.”

The teacher’s teacher was naturally a master ancestor to them.

The old scholar replied that it was a small matter, and they were the ones truly working hard, traveling thousands of miles to study.

Cao Qinglang hesitated and asked, “Master Ancestor, I have some confusion regarding naming and its essence.”

The old scholar nodded and asked with a smile, “Before you ask, where do you think my knowledge has been most useful to you? Or what do you most wish to apply? No need to rush; think slowly. This isn’t a test, so don’t be nervous. Just consider it a casual chat.”

On the side, Zhong Qiu looked forward to Cao Qinglang’s answer.

Cao Qinglang clearly already had a conclusion, replying without hesitation, “Master Ancestor, I have read your works line by line, and while some understanding is still shallow and some concepts remain elusive, the biggest takeaway is that your reasoning is the most sound. The principles you articulate are profound, yet your explanations are clear, making the path ahead, despite being beautiful, easy to tread. Thus, your teachings seem like precious treasures scattered along the road, allowing future scholars to ‘pick up wealth effortlessly’ without needing to dig for gold and silver.”

The old scholar nodded vigorously, “Exactly, exactly.”

Li Baoping gently nodded and added, “The Master Ancestor has long said that you’re like a person walking ahead, generously dropping valuable knowledge along the road, which future scholars can pick up without needing to toil for.”

The old scholar’s expression brightened further, nodding approvingly.

The old scholar even felt that the students he had accepted were indeed surpassing their predecessors.

So, the old scholar finally said, “Baoping, Qinglang, and of course, Teacher Zhong, if you have any questions in the future, you can ask Mao Xiaodong. Her studies won’t go astray, and her teaching will be sound; she’s truly remarkable.”

Zhong Qiu said with a smile, “I heard the Younang Lake has excellent wine. I’ll pay for it and treat the Confucian Sage to a drink.”

The old scholar rubbed his hands together, smiling, “That sounds great!”

**At the Fallen Star Mountain.**

Chen Nuanshu carried a water bucket and went to the first floor of the bamboo building to tidy up the house of the absent master.

The desk was always spotless, and she carefully wiped the inkstone, pen holder, and paperweights on the table. Chen Nuanshu glanced at the neatly stacked books, pursed her lips, and extended her hands, seemingly organizing the books, though they ended up slightly askew.

Once she crossed the threshold and gently closed the door, a little figure with lotus-like features appeared, climbing up a table leg. It began to scurry around the desk, noticing the paperweight had been slightly askew the day before, and that items on the multi-treasure shelf weren’t placed properly, and today the books were carelessly arranged. The little one giggled, quickly covered its mouth, and tiptoed to the books, from tiptoeing to lying on the ground, carefully helping Sister Nuanshu stack the books neatly. Not yet satisfied, the little figure ran around the small mountain of books to ensure everything was perfectly aligned before sitting at the edge of the table, swinging its legs happily, rejoicing in having helped Sister Nuanshu once again.

The little figure hoped to see that white-clothed youth again soon, wanting to ask if they could greet Sister Nuanshu and Sister Mi Li without bothering them, perhaps even once every ten days or once a month. However, he hadn’t come for a long time. The youth’s teacher hadn’t returned home in even longer.

So, with nothing to do, the little one ran to the pen holder, using its remaining little arm to wipe the inside of the holder.

Outside the bamboo building, three people returned from Qilong Lane. The long-lived friend visited Wei Wenlong’s office, while Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qi came to the bamboo building. They had now moved out of the Sword Mount, leaving only the sword cultivator Cui Wei still practicing there.

Qilong Lane was much livelier now. In addition to the straw-roof shop run by Jia Cheng and his two disciples, the neighboring New Year's shop's manager, Shi Rou, now had Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qi as her “two generals.” Plus, a woman named Chang Ming often helped at both shops.

For some reason, both Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qi felt a deep respect for the smiling lady. She seemed to have come into some money, buying two courtyards at once along the steps of Qilong Lane.

Every time Jiang Qi went up the mountain, he liked to gaze at the outer walls of the bamboo building.

However, Zhang Jiazhen saw nothing, while Jiang Qi insisted the wall was filled with characters and many symbols.

Today, Jiang Qi stood there, admiring the writings and symbols.

Zhang Jiazhen sat at a stone table, snacking on sunflower seeds with the sword immortal Mi Yu.

Mi Yu asked with a smile, “Are you envious of Jiang Qi?”

Zhang Jiazhen nodded, “I am.”

Jiang Qi was far more outgoing and clever than he was; he had already made himself quite at home in Qilong Lane and enjoyed going out alone, always returning with various treasures. Zhang Jiazhen couldn’t do that; he could only stick to his small patch of land, doing whatever Shi Rou asked him to do.

Mi Yu casually remarked, “There’s nothing to be envious about; everyone has their own fate.”

Zhang Jiazhen replied, “Master Chen said I lack the aptitude for cultivation, so practicing swordsmanship and martial arts is pointless.”

Mi Yu became interested, “Are you feeling frustrated, or do you not trust the Hidden Official’s judgment?”

Zhang Jiazhen shook his head with a smile, “I trust it, and I’m not frustrated. Therefore, I plan to learn some arts from Wei Shi in the future, to have a skill of my own. But even if I learn some basic techniques for accounting, I estimate I can only do some rote work, trying to become a store accountant dealing only with silver and copper coins. I probably won’t even see divine coins in this lifetime. Still, it’s better than being idle every day without knowing what to do.”

Mi Yu didn’t think much of it; dealing with women was his strength. As for talking with children, he truly wasn’t good at it nor interested, after all, he wasn’t the Hidden Official.

Zhang Jiazhen didn’t dare disturb the sword immortal Mi Yu’s training and took his leave, intending to head to the mountain god shrine at the peak to enjoy the scenery around Fallen Star Mountain.

Jiang Qi remained wide-eyed, staring at the bamboo building’s symbols and inscriptions.

On his way, Zhang Jiazhen ran into the boisterous little girl in black, cheerfully carrying a golden shoulder pole as she patrolled the mountain.

Zhang Jiazhen greeted her with a smile, “Sister Zhou, the Protector.”

The little girl squinted and replied politely, “Just call me Dà Shuǐ Guài (Big Water Monster).”

Then, upon hearing Zhang Jiazhen say he was going to the peak to enjoy the scenery, Zhou Mi Li immediately offered to lead the way.

Just as Zhou Mi Li turned, she spotted the tall Chang Ming, clad in a loose white robe, smiling brightly as she walked by.

Zhou Mi Li quickly called out, “Auntie!” Chang Ming nodded with a smile as she brushed past the little girl and Zhang Jiazhen.

Zhou Mi Li stood still, her head turning to follow Chang Ming, and only when she could no longer see her did she return to her place beside Zhang Jiazhen, unable to hold back any longer, and asked, “Zhang Jiazhen, do you know why Auntie Chang Ming is always smiling, yet her eyes seem to squint when she smiles?”

Zhang Jiazhen shook his head, “I don’t know.”

Zhou Mi Li chuckled, “It’s nothing much. Sister Nuanshu is just as clueless. I can’t help it; on Fallen Star Mountain, only Pei Qian seems sharper than me. Have you ever heard the saying about someone being greedy for money? You probably haven’t. Pei Qian often takes me out for walks and sometimes finds a copper coin. When I smile, Pei Qian says I’m greedy for money, haha! Am I really a money-grubber? Haha, that’s such a ridiculous joke; I’m just pretending for Pei Qian. I wouldn’t even blink at money that falls on the ground…”

Halfway through her sentence, Zhou Mi Li suddenly stopped, staring ahead with wide eyes and furrowed brows. She then flung her golden shoulder pole high into the air, pouncing on an object, rolling over, catching her golden shoulder pole, dusting off her clothes, and turning around to blink, confused, “What’s the matter? Let’s go! There’s no money to be picked up on the ground.”

Zhang Jiazhen held back his laughter, nodding in agreement.

This was the “Water Monster” spoken of by Master Chen.

Suddenly, Zhou Mi Li frowned again, turning sideways to Zhang Jiazhen, cautiously extending her hand from her sleeve to reveal her palm. Oh no! Where did the money go?

She had planned to pick up the money and boast to Sister Nuanshu. Now Fallen Star Mountain really had no money. The last time she asked Wei Shanjun when the next night tour banquet would be held, Wei Shanjun had smiled awkwardly.

Zhou Mi Li stood frozen.

As Pei Qian had said, there was a murderous intent!

It turned out someone was holding down her head from behind, smiling and asking, “Little Mi Li, who’s greedy for money?”

Zhou Mi Li frowned, extending one hand and turning her head with a pitiful expression, “Auntie, on my honor, I didn’t know I was sleep-talking in my dreams.”

“Take another look at your palm.”

Chang Ming released her grip, squinting and smiling, then turned to leave.

Zhou Mi Li discovered a shiny copper coin had appeared in her hand.

Zhou Mi Li bit it, her teeth chattering. The little girl immediately turned and shouted a thank you to Chang Ming.

The future ruler of Fallen Star Mountain waved her hand lightly, signaling that the little girl who called her Auntie didn’t need to be so polite.

Zhou Mi Li bounced and jumped, leading Zhang Jiazhen to the peak, always keeping her eyes on the ground.

Without Pei Qian around, it had been a long time since she had picked up money!

At the stone bench by the bamboo building, Wei Ban appeared.

This Wei Shanjun truly hadn’t expected that Jiang Qi lacked the aptitude for sword cultivation yet could still learn talismans.

In the realm of talismans, aptitude could distinguish the divine from the mundane. Achievements were either made or not made at all, and one had to obediently switch to practicing other mystical arts. It was similar to whether one could become a sword cultivator.

Mi Yu leaned on the stone table with one elbow, watching Jiang Qi’s figure from behind.

Mi Yu shrugged, “Jiang Qi, even if he has the aptitude for talismans, it’s still a matter of innate constitution, and his natural talent and perceptions as a fortunate cultivator on the mountain need to be considered. Plus, at this age, starting to practice will present significant challenges.”

Mi Yu, being a sword immortal, could naturally discern these weights and measures. He estimated that Jiang Qi would find it challenging to break through to the Golden Core stage, and at best, could only hope to reach the Sea Observation stage or, with good fortune, the Dragon Gate stage.

Wei Ban glanced at the sword immortal, chuckling, shaking his head.

Mi Yu immediately laughed, “I was wrong and must change my ways!”

Fallen Star Mountain indeed never cared about aptitude or cultivation levels.

“Whoever mentions realms is the most mundane.”

“Mi Yu, don’t mind me as an outsider meddling; as those who can be considered elders, a single thoughtless remark or an indifferent glance could leave a younger one in concern for a long time, so we should be cautious. It’s really not as simple as imparting knowledge or reprimanding.”

At other celestial mountains, who would bother with such trivial matters?

Mi Yu straightened his posture, nodding, “Don’t worry; I understand the reasoning. The Hidden Official once said, ‘Don’t spare effort on trivial matters, but save heart on major matters.’ I’m just a bit stubborn with my bad habits, and it’s hard to change overnight. In the future, Wei Shanjun, please remind me more. I know I don’t have much face left, but I have one good point: I know my worth, differentiate between good and bad, appreciate kindness, and listen to advice.”

Wei Ban teased, “That’s not just ‘one good point.’”

Mi Yu raised his thumb and laughed, “Treat others with sincerity, treat others with sincerity!”

Having seen Mi Yu and Wei Ban, Chang Ming cupped her hands in greeting.

Wei Ban returned the gesture, calling out, “Friend Chang Ming.”

Chang Ming’s visit to Fallen Star Mountain was perhaps the easiest for Wei Shanjun.

Because of a single word concerning money, Wei Ban’s reputation had spread all the way to the Northern Continent.

Mi Yu quickly stood, “Sister Chang Ming, it’s rare for you to visit the mountain; please sit and chat.”

However, Chang Ming ignored Mi Yu and walked straight to the cliff’s edge, gazing towards the direction of the Red Candle Town, where wealth was unusually abundant, as if it could draw some to her mountain, unnoticed by anyone except for the peaks of Cloud-Peeking Mountain and the Yang family pharmacy.

At Taihui Sword Sect, on the Elegant Peak.

Bai Shou sat alone on a bamboo chair, feeling gloomy. He had had a quarrel with several direct disciples from the Ancestor Hall outside the Elegant Peak. There were even two who were rumored to potentially become his junior brother and sister. Initially, everyone had a decent relationship, but after a small joke led to an inexplicable argument, it spiraled into a host of annoyances. After the argument ended, Bai Shou realized that what he had disregarded truly mattered to them, while what they valued, he had completely overlooked. This left Bai Shou feeling helpless, as both sides had their points, yet it had become a tangled mess.

It started as a trivial matter; the other party had made a small joke, and Bai Shou casually remarked something back, only for the other party to inexplicably get angry, leading to a full-blown argument. Afterward, it felt like a multitude of burdens had accumulated, and only after the argument did he realize that while he didn’t care, they genuinely did.

In the end, Bai Shou took the initiative to apologize, and the matter was laid to rest.

If they were to meet again and act as if they didn’t know each other, that would be too petty. Yet, returning to the previous light-heartedness felt difficult, as Bai Shou felt it would seem insincere.

At this moment, Bai Shou missed Pei Qian quite a bit. That black charcoal girl openly held grudges, never hesitating to let others know. Whenever she kept accounts in her small ledger, Pei Qian would make sure to record them right under the other party’s nose. This way of interacting was actually quite relaxed for him. Furthermore, Pei Qian wasn’t truly narrow-minded; as long as her boundaries were respected, such as not boasting about being sworn brothers with Chen Pingan, or insisting that sword cultivators were superior to sword repairers, she was quite easy to get along with.

Qi Jinglong returned northward from the Bone Marsh, riding his sword back to the Ancestor Hall and returning to Elegant Peak to find his eldest disciple lamenting and wanting to drink.

Qi Jinglong asked with a smile, “What’s wrong?”

Bai Shou briefly recounted the situation, concluding, “That Liu fellow talks a lot of reason; just pick a few points to help me feel better.”

At Elegant Peak, Bai Shou could call Liu by his surname, but he must still address him as Master.

Qi Jinglong sat on a bamboo chair and said, “Remember this: right and wrong cannot be added or subtracted.”

Bai Shou waited for a long time but received nothing in response, irked, “What kind of comfort is that?”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “Then let’s add another: give others some leeway to not speak of my principles.”

Bai Shou rolled his eyes, “You win.”

Qi Jinglong closed his eyes to rest.

Bai Shou asked, “Were you hurt?”

Qi Jinglong shook his head, “I’m fine.”

Bai Shou said, “I didn’t slack off in practicing swordsmanship while you were on the mountain!”

Qi Jinglong opened his eyes and nodded, “I could tell.”

Bai Shou waved his hand, “Hurry up and nurture your sword and heal your injuries. Speaking with a proud disciple like me shouldn’t have too many rules.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, closed his eyes, and continued to cultivate his sword intent.

A few days later, a visitor arrived at Elegant Peak. Qi Jinglong had heard of this person but had never interacted with him before.

Liu Zhiqing, the newly ascended sword cultivator from the Golden Crow Palace.

Initially, Liu Zhiqing did not visit Taihui Sword Sect immediately to meet Qi Jinglong. Instead, he first visited the River Dragon Sect and the Floating Weed Sword Lake, as well as the Chongxuan Office of the Great Source Dynasty, visiting various sects either by passing through or formally calling upon them.

Only then did he arrive at Elegant Peak.

Bai Shou took his sword and flew down to the foot of the mountain, eager to see the drama since he heard the newcomer was a friend of Chen Pingan.

Then Liu Zhiqing met the master of Taihui Sword Sect.

After they were seated, Qi Jinglong smiled and asked, “Daoist Liu, did you meet Chen Pingan at the Spring Dew Pavilion on Yu Ying Cliff?”

Liu Zhiqing replied, “Actually, we met even earlier, but we became friends at Yu Ying Cliff.”

He then took out a jar of wine—two jars, three jars.

Bai Shou coughed, “Liu Sword Immortal, my master usually doesn’t drink.”

Liu Zhiqing nodded, acknowledging that he understood, and began to drink by himself.

Bai Shou held back laughter, lightly patting his belly.

Qi Jinglong took a deep breath. 

Firstly, when Xu Xing arrived at the Cloud City tavern, he immediately started drinking without so much as a word. Qi Jinglong had been unable to stop him.

Then came the unexpected “drinking champion Qi Sword Immortal” at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Now, another Liu Zhiqing had come, ready to drink as if it were a contest.

Bai Shou gleefully reminded, “That Liu fellow, what was the reasoning you gave for how to get along with others?”

Liu Zhiqing became even more puzzled.

When friendships are not deep enough, one compensates with alcohol and continues drinking.

Qi Jinglong had no choice but to tell Liu Zhiqing about Chen Pingan’s complete disregard for manners when it came to drinking.

After learning the truth, Liu Zhiqing felt helpless, realizing that like master, like disciple.

Liu Zhiqing recalled something and said to Bai Shou, “Pei Qian asked me to pass a message to you…”

However, as soon as Liu Zhiqing started to speak, Bai Shou jumped up, “Don’t say, don’t say! I won’t listen!”

Liu Zhiqing found himself even more confused. There seemed to be nothing wrong with Pei Qian’s statement; it merely indicated their masters were friends and that she and Bai Shou were also friends.

Qi Jinglong laughed, “Go ahead. Whether he listens is up to Bai Shou; don’t mind him.”

Only then did Liu Zhiqing say, “Pei Qian mentioned she would visit Elegant Peak on her way back and look for Bai Shou.”

Bai Shou wiped his face, still not fully convinced, cautiously asking, “Liu Zhiqing, when Pei Qian said that, did she seem sincere or just casual?”

Liu Zhiqing thought for a moment before truthfully saying, “She chuckled.”

Bai Shou, who had been holding onto a glimmer of hope, suddenly felt crushed, pressing his hands to his head and mumbling, “Now that’s a real mess.”

Qi Jinglong couldn’t help but laugh, but he quickly composed himself, reminding Bai Shou, “Since you returned from the Sword Qi Great Wall, your breakthrough hasn’t been slow.”

At the armor store in the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was probably the time when this direct disciple was the most focused and dedicated to practicing the sword.

Even after returning to Taihui Sword Sect’s Elegant Peak, he had been considerably more diligent than before his travels.

Bai Shou straightened up, struck his knee with his fist, and laughed heartily. However, as the laughter died down, he comforted himself feebly, “Let’s just settle things through civil discourse; martial disputes can harm relationships. I’ll avoid bringing up the topic of sword cultivators versus sword repairers. If worse comes to worst, I’ll just use her master as a shield. What can I do? She’s simply better at finding a master than I am, while I’m only good at finding a disciple…”

Liu Zhiqing glanced at Qi Jinglong, who seemed accustomed to this.

Afterward, Liu Zhiqing remained at Elegant Peak, daily consulting Qi Jinglong about sword techniques, and of course, Qi Jinglong had no intention of holding back.

Bai Shou finally managed to recover from the bad news of Pei Qian visiting Elegant Peak.

That day, a flying sword from Lion Peak conveyed a message to Taihui Sword Sect, and it was promptly delivered to Elegant Peak.

After Qi Jinglong read the confidential letter, a smile crept upon his face as he glanced at his disciple, who was finally recovering some semblance of spirit. 

This time, Qi Jinglong truly couldn’t bear to reveal the truth.

Bai Shou caught a glimpse of his master’s expression, crossing his arms and trying to compose himself, “It’s no big deal. Tomorrow, Pei Qian will come looking for me. What’s there to fear? Why should I be scared?”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “The good news is the letter states Pei Qian won’t be coming to Elegant Peak for now because she’s headed to the Aiai Continent. There’s even better news; do you want to hear it?”

Bai Shou grinned broadly, “Sure, sure.”

Qi Jinglong said, “Pei Qian has already reached the Ascending Realm, though unfortunately, she missed breaking through to the strongest level twice.”

Bai Shou leapt to his feet, stomping in frustration, “What do you mean she reached the Ascending Realm?! Huh? Right, Master? Master!”

In a moment of urgency, he called for his master repeatedly, as if he had learned this trick from Chen Pingan.

Liu Zhiqing was taken aback, “Ascending Realm?”

Previously, Pei Qian was merely a sixth-realm martial artist at the Golden Crow Palace.

Qi Jinglong nodded, smiling, and handed the letter to Liu Zhiqing. “In her letter, Pei Qian apologized to both you and me regarding the drinking incident.”

Liu Zhiqing accepted the letter, glanced through it, and returned it to Qi Jinglong with a knowing smile, “That Pei Qian, worthy of being Chen Pingan’s first disciple; she certainly knows how to mimic others.”

Qi Jinglong sighed, “In fact, Chen Pingan didn’t want Pei Qian to learn martial arts in the first place.”

Liu Zhiqing said, “That’s just like Chen Pingan.”

The two exchanged knowing smiles.

A friend’s friend may not always be a friend.

Still, both Qi Jinglong and Liu Zhiqing felt that they could become friends.

Moreover, Liu Zhiqing had long admired Qi Jinglong’s talent in talismans.

Before meeting Chen Pingan, Liu Zhiqing had regarded the rumors of Qi Jinglong’s reasoning and clarity as somewhat suspect.

One reason was that Liu Zhiqing didn’t think it fitting for a sword cultivator to act this way; after all, being a sword cultivator meant everything revolved around principles connected to the sword.

Moreover, he worried that it could be a facade for some ulterior motive, as cultivators on the mountain often had their own schemes.

However, after years of experience, feeling like a half-dead person sitting on the mountaintop, witnessing the trivial matters of the Golden Crow Palace from afar, he understood that truly grasping a small principle was no easier than a sword cultivator breaking through.

Often, principles don’t lie within the principles themselves but in the difficulty of “articulating” those principles.

Whether it’s the mountain or the valley, teaching and reasoning are challenging.

Sometimes, one must admit that some individuals thrive by disregarding principles and breaking the rules.

Liu Zhiqing decided that when reaching the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul stage, he would choose a bustling city or the martial world to observe the hearts of men over decades or even centuries.

Liu Zhiqing raised the wine jar in his hand, smiling, and asked, “So what do you say?”

Qi Jinglong laughed heartily, “Let’s drink! I, Yu Pu, am not afraid of you, a Nascent Soul!”

Bai Shou squatted beside the bamboo chair, lifting his head with a resentful gaze, “Master, I want to drink too.”

Qi Jinglong smiled at Liu Zhiqing, who nodded in agreement.

Liu Zhiqing not only brought the three jars of wine he had taken out at first but also prepared many jars of celestial wine.

Bai Shou drank, and as he continued, he began to laugh, not out of misery but because Pei Qian had broken through to the Ascending Realm, becoming a pure martial artist. Although this seemed troublesome for him—he could easily find himself on the ground after a careless kick from her—it was still a good thing. How could it not be good?

Sitting on the bamboo chair, Bai Shou suddenly grinned, thinking, damn it, this wine is truly terrible. That Liu fellow doesn’t like to drink, and he was right all along.

Liu Zhiqing quietly commended, “Your disciple has a good temperament.”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “Naturally.”

Liu Zhiqing fell silent for a moment before asking, “What about the merger of the two continents?”

Qi Jinglong’s expression grew serious. “It’s not easy. There were three major demon lords from the barbaric world that suddenly appeared, namely Yao Jia, Yang Zhi, and Fi Fei. The Fire Dragon True Man and a flying ascendant from Lushui Pit, as well as a senior in white robes, had a fierce battle with them. The devastation was not exaggerated. We, as Jade Purity realm sword cultivators, actually find it difficult to truly control such chaos. Brother Liu, there are some internal matters that are temporarily unsuitable to disclose, but please understand.”

At that time, the sword cultivator Ruan Xiu had performed some kind of technique that instantly shrouded the area within a hundred miles in darkness, condensing everything into a singular brilliant light that captured a celestial demon attempting to ambush her.

That light was then dropped into the depths of the ocean by Li Liu from Lion Peak.

Ultimately, it was swallowed by the ascendant woman from Lushui Pit, and a celestial demon perished without explanation.

Liu Zhiqing nodded, “I understand. It’s a pity my realm is too low; even if I had known this news in advance, I wouldn’t have the face to offer help.”

Qi Jinglong suddenly laughed heartily, “At the Sword Qi Great Wall, the only foreign cultivator of a continent would be regarded highly by the local sword cultivators.”

Qi Jinglong pointed a thumb at himself, “That’s us!”

Bai Shou rarely saw his master so spirited.

The Liu fellow had always been an introverted person, known for his external softness and internal strength. He was too agreeable but could be very hard to deal with at times.

Liu Zhiqing was now brimming with energy. Without hesitation, he raised his head and drank.

After a hearty drink, he looked at Qi Jinglong, certain that he wouldn’t encourage him to drink again.

Qi Jinglong helplessly replied, “That’s not what I meant.”

Liu Zhiqing raised an eyebrow.

Qi Jinglong had no choice but to follow suit and drink.

Bai Shou took a small sip and remarked, “Actually, the Sword Qi Great Wall has a decent impression of Baoping Continent. For other continents, they only recognize a certain sword immortal or a few sword cultivators, and not the entire continent. Baoping Continent is an exception.”

Qi Jinglong rubbed his forehead.

While this was indeed true, it was not the right time to mention it. Before drinking, one could discuss anything freely.

As expected, Liu Zhiqing began again.

However, this time Liu Zhiqing only took a sip and did not drink excessively.

Qi Jinglong drank more than Liu Zhiqing.

Liu Zhiqing suddenly felt that Chen Pingan and Pei Qian might not be lying. Once Qi Jinglong started drinking, he was a bottomless pit?

Qi Jinglong helplessly said, “My wine tolerance isn’t that good; today is an exception.”

Bai Shou mimicked Pei Qian’s playful laugh.

Liu Zhiqing did too.

Qi Jinglong’s mood soured as he took a large gulp of wine.

It wasn’t that he was upset about remembering Chen Pingan; rather, he was reminded of this friend who truly loved drinking and might not be able to drink for a long time.

In the Northern Continent, after Li Cai returned to Floating Weed Sword Lake, she began to enter seclusion to heal her wounds.

As this sword immortal said, “If you get into a fight without getting hurt, then what kind of fight is that?”

After coming out of seclusion, she chatted with her two newly accepted disciples from the Sword Qi Great Wall, leaning against the railing, sipping her drink while gazing at the lake.

Chen Li couldn’t help but ask, “Master, why do the Northern Continent cultivators seem so simple-minded?”

What the youth meant was that his master’s students at Floating Weed Sword Lake seemed to lack common sense.

Only Rong Chang, the senior brother, was a little better; he could barely converse with him. 

The boy’s first and biggest impression of the entire Haoran world was that of the Hidden Official, whom he admired and yearned for deeply.

Meanwhile, Chen Li had earned himself the nickname “Little Hidden Official” after many real battles outside the city. This was bestowed upon him by others but was something the boy had earned himself.

Gao Youqing felt that her peers at Floating Weed Sword Lake, as well as those who respectfully called her Master Ancestor or Grand Master Ancestor, were quite nice, friendly and warm, and although they all guessed their identities, they never spoke any strange words. 

She had heard that the Hidden Official’s strange remarks could fill several baskets, even more intimidating than the flying swords of the great sword immortals. Just picking up a random statement would be like wielding a flying sword.

Her brother, Gao Ye Hou, often spoke of this, while Pang Yuanji mostly smiled and said nothing.

However, Chen Li found it hard to speak around Gao Youqing, as he trusted her completely, believing she was much smarter than him and learned quickly. Now, not only was he familiar with Northern Continent’s elegant language, but he also mastered the elegant language of Baoping Continent and the official language of the Great Lu. As for sword practice, he didn’t need to elaborate; it was well known that Chen Li had made significant progress during his time at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Li Cai had just heard the boy’s words when she shook the wine jar, laughing, “It’s not that they lack insight; it’s that Chen Pingan has too much insight.”

At this, Li Cai angrily tossed the empty wine jar into the lake, “Damn it, he even kidnapped my most beloved disciple, and you know what’s the most infuriating part?”

After settling down, she reached out to gently push Gao Youqing’s head aside, teasingly saying, “Go away, don’t like me. I beg you not to like me. That’s just how Chen Pingan is. And that silly disciple of yours likes him even more.”

Gao Youqing’s face turned slightly red, “I don’t like the Hidden Official.”

Chen Li chuckled, “Correct, correct, you only like Pang Yuanji.”

Chen Li mimicked a gesture of holding a wooden tablet, saying to himself, “Pang, High. Yuanji, Youqing. Parting in the Qi, reuniting by the waterside.”

Li Cai’s eyes lit up, “Youqing, good job! We’re at Floating Weed Sword Lake, and with the saying about a leaf of floating weed returning to the ocean, where in life doesn’t one meet again? The Northern Continent has the River Crossing, and with the lake waters being so green, Qi matches Ji, and Qing matches Qing. You’re quite clever, little girl; your mind is full of twists and turns!”

Gao Youqing’s face flushed bright red as she tugged at her master’s sleeve.

Li Cai then coughed and glared at Chen Li, “You little rascal, don’t make liking a joke! Do you want to get beaten?”

Chen Li sighed, “Fine, fine. You’re right, Master.”

Just a moment ago, he could still see how merry his master was, even more cheerful than her disciples.

Li Cai’s mood improved as she left.

After Master departed, Chen Li suddenly spoke, “It’s very difficult for our Master to reach the Ascendant Realm.”

The boy felt a surge of sadness.

Even though he had seen many lives and deaths, it still saddened him, like an uninvited guest who came and stayed, even without making noise, making one uncomfortable.

Gao Youqing’s eyes reddened instantly; she lowered her head, softly replying, “Mm,” her hands clenched into fists.

Chen Li spoke seriously, “So we must practice swordsmanship harder than any other cultivators at Floating Weed Sword Lake. We need to endure more hardships and improve our sword techniques faster! Gao Youqing, aside from being bullied by outsiders, I won’t interfere with your affairs. But if you dare to slack off in your sword practice one day, I will definitely scold you. Even if our Master still protects you, I will still scold you.”

Gao Youqing raised her head, nodding vigorously.

Chen Li took a moment and softly said to her, “Once you reach the Golden Core stage, let’s go visit the Hidden Official’s hometown together.”

In the Northern Continent.

At the Ghostly Pit Valley’s Yangchang Palace, an old rat demon would sneak in and read books whenever its ancestor was away.

A soldier cultivator from the Ghostly Axe Palace still enjoyed wandering the martial world alone, and after completing a moderately sized act of chivalry, he would casually introduce himself as “Du Haoren” (Du the Good Person). The two charms given to him by the sword immortal Chen had been carefully kept, and Du Yu valued them even more than the Golden Crow armor that Jiang Shangzhen had gifted him.

A pair of sisters who had once almost fallen into danger while slaying demons at the Golden Bell Temple continued to depend on each other, wandering around the mountains and rivers. In winter, the younger sister’s cheeks would flush red, looking even prettier than if she had applied rouge.

A young boy in green, carrying a hiking staff and a bamboo box, met a new friend—a young horseman. Chen Lingjun found a kindred spirit in him, believing in the old saying, “Without friends from a thousand miles away, how could one have a powerful presence?”

Before parting ways, Chen Lingjun told the boy that he would go do something grand, something so significant that once accomplished, he would never fear being punched to death by anyone.

That friend wished him safe travels, and Chen Lingjun stood on the bamboo box, patting his good buddy on the shoulder, saying, “Good buddy, I’ll take your good wishes!”

On Baoping Continent.

At the Sword Water Villa in the Shuishui Kingdom, Song Yushao invited friends according to old traditions and held a grand ceremony to wash his hands of the martial world, completely retiring to live a peaceful life.

Unlike the past incident when his bamboo sword sheath was snatched away, this time he genuinely acknowledged his age. He felt reassured about the younger generation at home, and there was not a hint of regret.

On ordinary days, he would guide the disciples of the villa in swordsmanship, occasionally indulge in hot pot in a small town, share a drink, sit at the scenic pavilion, and leisurely flip through books, enjoying a carefree life day by day.

Once, one of the four fiends of Shuishui Kingdom, the girl in embroidered shoes, chuckled, “Look, how interesting! Chen Ping’an, Chen Ping’an. The books say he is the most compassionate and tender-hearted towards us beauties and ghostly maidens.”

A servant girl who was a beautiful ghost glanced at a certain spot by the campfire, feeling somewhat apprehensive, for it was there that the boy had once sat, suddenly rising to slay…ghosts.

Whatever the young sword immortal was described to be in the books, she would believe it, except for this matter. She wouldn’t believe it even if it cost her life, as the last person who believed it was no longer alive. He had been the kind to grab heads and punch without mercy.

Once a gloomy ghostly mansion, it now stood as a beautiful residence with mountains and rivers surrounding it.

The couple brewed wine year after year, the quantity increasing, but they had yet to wait for that person to share a drink with.

Outside the walls of the Great Lu capital, as Cui Dongshan idly wandered on his horse, he was surprised to see the old bastard who had rushed back from the Northern Continent.

He had thought the old bastard would remain in the Great Lu capital, or simply keep an eye on the newly opened path at the northernmost point.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, “Oh, you don’t seem to be in a good mood.”

“Then my mood is quite good.”

After all, the trends in Baoping Continent and the Northern Continent were both clear in the intelligence reports; nothing was unexpected.

Cui Zhan remained silent.

Cui Dongshan had no intention of letting the old bastard off easily, “You’ve been promoted to a mountain master of the academy, and you’re still not happy? Looking across the entire Haoran world, there are only seventy-one mountain masters; how rare!”

Cui Zhan, that old bastard, had unexpectedly taken the initiative to request to become a mountain master of the academy. Cui Dongshan truly hadn’t thought of a rational explanation, feeling that the old bastard was simply smearing mud on his own face. What was he after, truly?

As for Tongye Continent, its fate was indifferent; it brought this upon itself. Cui Dongshan had said long ago, “Taking advantage, just enjoy it quietly. Don’t make a fuss; you’ll have to pay it back sooner or later.”

Now, Song Jixin had taken charge of the construction of the former Zhu Ying dynasty’s capital from the Old Dragon City. This was merely nominal; initially, during the construction of the capital, the prince, “Song Mu,” had only made a brief appearance and left. Today, he returned to finalize the project. However, the real work was being done by the master of the Mo family, as well as Liu Qingfeng, who had been promoted to the right assistant minister of the Great Lu’s Ministry of Works.

Cui Zhan remarked, “Gao Cheng will soon head south to Baoping Continent.”

Gao Cheng had no choice. A sect like the Pima Sect might not be able to handle the Ghostly Pit, but Gao Zhan understood the stakes.

Cui Dongshan continued, “The old monk is the same.”

Zhi Gui had already begun to traverse the newly carved Qi Du, and there wouldn’t be any accidents. Once she successfully crossed, she would immediately ascend from the Jade Purity stage to the Ascendant Realm, after all, she bore divine fortune as a true dragon. At the very least, she could be regarded as half of an Ascendant.

She was responsible for guarding the Great Ditch in the central part of Baoping Continent, which was more than enough.

The imitation of the White Jade Capital had smoothly relocated to the capital of the Great Lu behind Cui Dongshan, where the Mo family’s wandering scholar Xu Ruo was stationed, and the Mountain Lords of the Five Peaks could easily slay demons.

All the smaller vassal states along the coast had incorporated their soldiers, from celestial cultivators to earthly soldiers, into the Great Lu army. Even before this, the Great Lu had already stationed civil and military officials and had driven the common people to build coastal defenses.

Every subordinate in the interior of the continent had to send half their troops to defend at designated locations ordered by the Great Lu. As for the remaining cultivators and deities, they were supposed to head to the coast, but they could have the vassal rulers pay a significant amount of divine money on their behalf, and it surely wasn’t a small amount. Should any negligence occur, the Great Lu would directly hold the vassal kings accountable.

They had to contribute manpower, resources, and money; at the very least, they needed to provide goodwill. The so-called goodwill referred to the various vassal states’ literati who would use their pens to write moral essays for the many soldiers who would perish gloriously on the front lines in the future.

In addition, Cui Zhan had borrowed a character, “Water,” from a renowned scholar known for his unruly temperament, but who respected only one person throughout his life—Cui Zhan. It wasn’t that he admired Cui Zhan’s rebellion against his masters and destruction of his ancestors, but he genuinely appreciated Cui Zhan’s knowledge.

Regardless of how infamous Cui Zhan was among the various schools, the truth was that many admired him.

One only needed to look at the “Cloud Color Spectrum” and the collection of writings treasured by the celestial beings on the mountain to understand how well-read Cui Zhan truly was.

Cui Zhan suddenly sneered, “Your teacher doesn’t seem too bright.”

The implication was that the disciples of the Confucian Sage lineage weren’t particularly clever.

Whether it was a lineage or a sect, the first disciple and the last disciple were both crucial.

Cui Dongshan immediately dropped his smile, seriously asking, “How do we remedy this?”

Not bothering with the reasons, only seeking results.

When it came to accomplishments and knowledge, three fundamental threads existed. One was to minimize contradictions and the creation of additional conflicts as much as possible, without getting entangled in the larger issues of human nature, allowing moral gentlemen and scholars to slowly explain. Whether one read or not would no longer become a barrier to knowledge.

The second was that once problems arose, the solutions must be well-founded and effective, yielding immediate results.

Lastly, the knowledge itself must continuously improve its own rules, not be gradually discarded due to the influence of societal winds, popular sentiment, or human hearts.

The grand principles of accomplishments and knowledge were like solid riverbeds, allowing future generations to inhabit naturally along the water. Even if some minor rules were separated due to personal preferences, they should still be like streams and wells, allowing people to draw water and drink, coexisting peacefully with the mundane world.

Cui Zhan shook his head, “There’s no way to remedy it; they can only save themselves.”

The Great Lu National Teacher fell silent for a moment, “If they think of something, it may not immediately extricate them from their predicament, but it will buy them more time.”

Cui Dongshan’s expression grew serious, “Is it that fabricated travelogue?”

As he tentatively inquired, he began to think rapidly, instantly flipping through the contents of the book in his mind. In a moment, he eliminated three directions and settled on one choice.

The thirty-thousand-word travelogue comprised twenty-four chapters. The opening chapter mentioned how the young “Chen Pingan” had once described the steep cliffs and rugged terrain of his hometown while chopping firewood.

In the fourth chapter, there was the line “The yellow birds flutter, the waters glisten.” In the sixth chapter, it wrote, “The lake’s waters shimmer, startling the fish and dragons.” 

In the eleventh chapter, there was the phrase “The giant cliffs are imposing.”

And the mention of “yellow birds fluttering” was a direct reference to a poem, which also included a clever touch in the original text. 

Thus, within the book, “cliff” only appeared once, while “glimmer” appeared twice, with “glisten” being repeated.

Cui Zhan had initially considered integrating “mountain and water glimmer” into a chapter title but quickly dismissed the idea, believing it underestimated the great demons from the barbaric world, especially that self-proclaimed old bookworm from the barbaric realm.

One, four, six. The only mention of “Cui” was in the eleventh chapter.

With these hints, it was more than enough.

Any more, and the chance of this book reaching Chen Pingan would be reduced to nothing.

Cui Dongshan slapped his face, a crisp sound echoing as he laughed bitterly, “Honestly, how many people could be clever enough to think this through? At our age, could we have thought of this?”

Cui Dongshan began to scratch his head angrily, lamenting, “If anyone had a functioning brain, they wouldn’t even think of this! Just like me—if you hadn’t pointed out the thread, would I have thought of it? Even if you killed me, I wouldn’t have thought of it!”

Cui Zhan said, “When one becomes clever enough, one must gamble on a bit of luck. He’s different from you; seeing this book is enough. But at the Sword Qi Great Wall, as long as he sees this book, given his character and situation, he will surely read it repeatedly.”

Cui Dongshan jumped down from the child’s back, squatting on the ground, hands on his head, and said, “You say it lightly!”

Cui Zhan stood in place, addressing the child, “You head into the city first.”

The child immediately bowed and ran away.

Cui Dongshan raised his head, curiously asking, “Could it be that this book was written by you?”

Cui Zhan shook his head, “Only the opening few thousand words were written by me; the rest were all done by someone else. However, how to use ‘cliff’ and ‘glimmer’ and where to use them, I already have a conclusion.”

Cui Dongshan muttered, “Why do this?”

It was a question, but not one asked in an inquiring tone.

Cui Zhan replied indifferently, “The best outcome would be that I can manipulate a barbaric world at my will, which is rather interesting. The worst outcome is that I also won’t let Chen Pingan’s existence behind him stir up more chaos in the world.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly laughed, “You have a sharp tongue but a soft heart? This is quite uncharacteristic of you, Cui Zhan.”

After stepping into the Ascendant Realm, Cui Zhan also gained the character “Glint” as his personal name.

No wonder Cui Zhan wanted to move further, becoming the recognized mountain master of the Temple of Literature and a Confucian sage, allowing him to borrow the mountains and rivers’ luck from the world.

And that remaining half of the Sword Qi Great Wall still belonged to the Haoran world.

So long as the sage refined the characters from that travelogue, and with a little thought, perhaps that travelogue could serve as a secret letter or a gateway, or possibly a method to ascend to the upper five realms—there were countless possibilities.

However, Cui Dongshan did not ask for the answer.

Cui Zhan said, “Writing this book serves not only to help him save himself, which is something the Baoping Continent owes him, but also to remind him that the inquiry at the Book Lake isn’t easily concluded by acknowledging one’s own desires. The principles of Qi Jingchun might help him find a way to coexist peacefully with this world. I have my own principles; I want to be a constant reminder for him, to make him uneasy.”

“I can’t listen to this right now, don’t bother me.” 

Cui Dongshan squatted on the ground, scratching aimlessly, and spoke, “I know I shouldn’t expect more from you, but I’m still angry.”

After holding it in for a long time, Cui Dongshan awkwardly said, “You’re willing to do all this; it’s already no small matter.”

Cui Zhan glanced at the crooked “old bastard” in the dirt, looking at the back of the child’s head, smiling, “Finally, you’re making some progress.”

Cui Dongshan slapped the ground, then stood up, annoyed, “Old bastard, don’t talk to me in such an elder’s tone!”

Cui Dongshan suddenly fell silent.

Cui Zhan hesitated for a moment and turned around.

An old scholar also remained silent for a long time before smiling, “After all these years, you still seem to be quite impoverished.”

The illustrious national teacher of the Great Lu, the former first disciple of the Confucian sage, Cui Zhan took a step back, bowed, and replied, “The crab that kneels six times and has two pincers is actually quite delicious.”

---

This year, the crescent moon shone across the Nine Continents, and the world shared in a single autumn.

Cui Dongshan sat alone atop the city wall, drinking wine.

Cao Qinglang stayed up late studying at the Rites Academy.

Under the Zhao tree, a figure had reached the Northern Continent’s Caijue Mansion, practicing his punches under the moonlight, having already completed one million punches.

Pei Qian was still traveling across continents, no longer riding the winds in the sky but instead running wildly across the surface of the sea.

As Chen Pingan’s little disciple, Guo Zhujiu accompanied Ning Yao, who had finally returned to the city, reminiscing about their master together. Guo Zhujiu asked Ning Yao, which was closer to their master, Fuyou Continent or Tongye Continent. Ning Yao said, in reality, neither was close.

Guo Zhujiu sniffled, “Why is it so far?”

Ning Yao mumbled, “Just wait a bit longer; one more realm to go.”
