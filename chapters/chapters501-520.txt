 ### Chapter 501: Riding Up the Hill (Part 2)

Once Zeng Ye finished purchasing the miscellaneous items, Chen Ping'an shared a little anecdote with them. He mentioned that the more accomplished Dragon Gate realm cultivator at the shop had chosen the wooden, awkward boy, while the Ocean Viewing realm cultivator had selected the clever boy. 

However, to the outsiders, these were trivial matters. For the two temporarily naïve boys, it would only be in the future, when they truly stepped into the path of cultivation, that they would understand the significance of those choices. It was akin to the time when the three riders parted ways with Xu Mao.

There was a chance encounter with a young woodcutter, who accidentally stumbled and fell, and as he dug into the snow, the sight that emerged terrified him to the core. Perhaps it was fate that compelled him; the boy, who had been struggling through tough times, gritted his teeth and, mustering his courage, dug deeper into the snow.

When he left, trembling, he was now in possession of a warm jade pendant. This pendant, cherished by Han Jingxin, was inscribed on one side with the ancient characters for “Cloudy Peak (Yunxia Mountain)” and on the other side, it bore a verse of cultivation poetry from Yunxia Mountain.

On the path of the Great Way, fortunes and misfortunes are unpredictable; every choice can lead to vastly different outcomes. 

Later, as Chen Ping'an and his companions continued their journey, a few days later at dusk, he suddenly dismounted, wandering off the road toward a patch of snow where the smell of blood was thick. With a flick of his sleeve, he scattered the snow, revealing a horrific scene beneath—mangled limbs and a chest hollowed out as if all the organs had been extracted. The sight was tragic; the corpses had likely died not long ago—just a day at most—and despite the aura of malice that should have enveloped this area, there were no signs of it.

It was the work of a practitioner with unique secret techniques.

Ma Duyi could hardly bear to look, while Zeng Ye stumbled away to dry heave.

Chen Ping'an buried the bodies a bit away from the road, doing his best to piece together the remains of those poor souls. After ensuring there was no one around, he took out a replica of the Glazed Pavilion from his belongings, summoning forth a spirit that had once been a Dragon Gate realm cultivator, now turned into a ghost general by Yu Huai.

The ghost general, maintaining its intelligence, spent half a day leading the trio to a secluded mountain range. Once at the border of a territory, Chen Ping'an sealed Ma Duyi within a talisman and allowed the ghost general to inhabit Zeng Ye.

They began their ascent and eventually found a cave with the words “Chopping the Zither” carved into the rock.

The landscape itself was spiritually rich, and the cave was a true gem. However, the practitioner who had first established this cultivation cave was long gone, leaving it to be occupied by mountain spirits and demons.

As Chen Ping'an and Zeng Ye stepped inside, after a hundred paces, their vision opened up to a vast stone chamber, brightly lit. There were several creatures, not yet fully transformed into humanoid forms, along with a powerful mountain demon seated on a throne. If it stood, it would tower over two meters, resembling a small mountain, draped in a golden robe and armor, with a crown askew on its head. Two stunningly beautiful women, dressed provocatively, reclined against the throne, massaging the demon's calves. Beside the throne, a man in a green robe sat in a purple sandalwood chair, a knowing smile on his face.

Both humans and demons alike seemed to be waiting for the two fools who had walked into their trap.

The golden-armored demon, its leopard head still retaining its true form, lounged against the back of the chair, shaking a massive wine cup in hand. When some crimson wine spilled onto the ground, it casually lifted a foot and placed it on one of the beautiful woman's heads, who immediately bent down to lick up the spilled wine, her face full of ecstasy as she looked up afterward.

The man in the green robe turned to the demon, giving a thumbs-up, and exclaimed, “Your Majesty, you truly embody the spirit of a ‘general holding a cup while watching the snow fall’!”

The demon grinned widely, saying, “What snow are you talking about? There hasn’t been snow for ages outside this cave, let alone inside!”

The man laughed, pointing at the voluptuous woman, “Your Majesty can just look down and see it!”

The demon burst into laughter, filling the cave with raucous noise.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Are you done chatting?”

The imposing demon squinted at him, “Are you that anxious to jump into the oil pot?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “We need to keep moving; it’s quite urgent.”

The green-robed man chuckled, “In such chaotic times, isn’t it better to die early and be reborn?”

Chen Ping'an nodded again, “That makes sense.”

Half an hour later, Chen Ping'an and the real Zeng Ye left the cave.

The ghost general, who chose to remain in the “Chopping the Zither” residence, saw the two off at the entrance. 

As for the demon inside the cave—the golden-armored Ocean Viewing realm “demon”—he was dead beyond resurrection. The green-robed man, though not a spirit or demon, was human and had also died before the demon, his soul devoured by the ghost general. 

The two human women, freed from their restraints, one chose to bind herself to the new master, while the other committed suicide against the wall. However, according to previous agreements, her soul was collected by Chen Ping'an and placed into the replica Glazed Pavilion where the ghost general resided.

As for the mountain spirits and demons, some were slain, but others survived; they likely had no idea why they were still alive. 

Because Chen Ping'an, the true accountant of Qingxia Island, had finished everything in less than half an incense stick’s time—half an hour was spent calculating.

Chen Ping'an told the ghost general, “Before I leave Shujian Lake, I’ll come to visit. Zeng Ye will come too.”

The ghost general nodded, “I will cultivate here in peace and won’t disturb the mundane scholars. Given the current chaos in Shihou Kingdom, there won’t be a shortage of fierce and malevolent ghosts during ordinary times.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “What about ten or a hundred years from now?”

The ghost general was taken aback.

Chen Ping'an said, “Strive to become a mountain god, even if it starts as an unrecognized shrine by the court.”

The ghost general was in awe, cupping his fists in salute, “Your kindness, Master Chen, I will remember!”

Chen Ping'an said nothing further, only took Zeng Ye and descended the mountain.

On the way, Chen Ping'an took out the talisman, allowing Ma Duyi to see daylight again.

He immediately began chatting animatedly with Zeng Ye.

Chen Ping'an could only shake his head helplessly.

Afterward, they rode on, heading north. Unlike their previous journey through the southern part of Shihou Kingdom where they could choose main roads, Chen Ping'an and his companions now began to prefer smaller paths.

One evening, they managed to reach a state city just before the gates closed. The heavily guarded soldiers at the city gate inspected their credentials before they hurriedly entered the city.

This “scarred” northern stronghold had fallen into the hands of the Great Li’s iron cavalry. However, the Great Li did not leave many troops to garrison the city, only about a hundred riders. They couldn’t even guard the city, let alone one of its gates. Besides them, there were only a few civil officials serving as secretaries, along with military aides.

After entering the city, they traversed nearly half of it before finally locating a small inn to rest.

The reason was simple: with the great battle concluded and heavy casualties, there had been a subsequent incident of assassins targeting Great Li officials. Furthermore, the day after was New Year’s Eve, and with the livelihoods of the people devastated, business was already slow—finding this inn was quite a stroke of luck.

The next day, Zeng Ye was possessed by a male spirit who took Chen Ping'an to locate a martial sect with a foundation in the state city. Though it was merely a third-rate power in the entirety of Shihou Kingdom’s martial world, for the local citizens, it remained an unshakeable giant. That spirit had once been among the common folks; his sister had caught the eye of the local power’s heir, and one day, along with her fiancé—who was nothing more than a poor teacher—she drowned in the river. The woman’s clothes were tattered, and those who saw her lifeless body floating in the water dared not look twice. The man had suffered a worse fate, as he seemed to have had his legs broken before “falling into the river.”

A young boy spent all his family’s savings to bury his sister and the man he considered her husband, then quietly left the city. Afterward, he wandered until he reached the Shujian Lake region, becoming a servant in a heavenly residence, lacking the qualifications for cultivation, even failing to learn martial arts, and ultimately meeting the same fate as his sister and her husband.

Zeng Ye stood before a door that had been rebranded.

Along the way, the spirit had already appeared lost; now, he looked utterly blank.

The grudge from those years was from thirty years ago.

This was not the end; before leaving the inn, when asking the innkeeper for directions, the elder sighed heavily and spoke of the men from that household and all the brave heroes of the sect—how they had sworn to protect the city gate. After they fell, the household was left with only children, nearly no men left.

Zeng Ye fell to his knees, clutching his head in anguish, muttering, “How could this happen? How could this happen…”

Chen Ping'an squatted beside him, remaining quiet even as Zeng Ye's face grew increasingly distorted, his eyes darkening. Chen Ping'an continued to sip his wine quietly.

After a moment, Zeng Ye's gaze gradually cleared. He began to sob, finally resting his hands on the ground, bowing his head, breathing heavily, unable to cry any longer.

Chen Ping'an finally spoke, “I feel like my worst times were not too different from yours, feeling like a dog, even worse than a dog, but in the end, we are still human.”

Chen Ping'an smiled bitterly, “Of course, I made it through. Although I didn’t eat sh*t, I've certainly stumbled through a lot more dog sh*t luck than you.”

Taking deep breaths, Zeng Ye plopped down on the ground, extending his hand, “Mr. Chen, can I borrow a few sips of wine? I’ve never had wine in my life.”

Chen Ping'an passed him the wine gourd, “There’s enough wine, I just worry if you can handle it.”

Zeng Ye raised the gourd and took a large swig, coughing violently, his whole body trembling as he was about to return it to the accountant.

Yet Chen Ping'an had already folded his arms and squatted there like an ordinary mortal, basking in the warm winter sun.

He shook his head, “Try drinking some more; maybe if you get used to it, you’ll understand the good of drinking.”

Zeng Ye actually did take another sip, grimacing, wiping his mouth, and shaking his head, “Still tastes terrible.”

Only then did Chen Ping'an take the gourd back, drank a mouthful, and then gently tucked it back at his waist.

Zeng Ye sat on the ground, glancing at the residence, his face filled with pain once more. He tried to speak several times but swallowed his words instead, covering his face with his hands.

Chen Ping'an turned his head and asked, “What is it? Do you want me to write down that family’s name so that when the grand ceremony and water-land ritual are held, I can include them?”

Chen Ping'an gently shook his head, “I won’t agree to that. I can write your name, your sister’s and brother-in-law’s names, but I won’t write any of those people’s names because I don’t know them. But I do know you.”

Zeng Ye choked up, “Am I being foolish?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Very foolish.”

Zeng Ye wiped his face, his eyes resolute, “As a useless waste like me, how could I have the face to pay respects at my sister and brother-in-law’s grave? Mr. Chen, could you help me pay respects and offer incense? I’ve already told you where the grave is… I won’t go myself.”

Chen Ping'an softly asked, “Are you really sure? You should know there will be no chance for regrets in this life.”

Zeng Ye nodded, “I’m sure.”

Chen Ping'an acknowledged with a sound.

Zeng Ye suddenly said, “Mr. Chen, when you go to the grave, can you tell my sister and brother-in-law that you are my friend?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “No problem.”

Zeng Ye then insisted he had to bow to Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an refused.

But Zeng Ye insisted, saying he wouldn’t be able to rest easy otherwise.

Chen Ping'an looked at the young man, originally named Zhou Guonian, lost in thought.

On New Year’s Eve.

Outside the state city, a small hill about a dozen kilometers away.

Before a small grave, someone was offering incense and wine.

The young man in a blue cotton robe, an outsider, recounted the truth of the matter, including how Zeng Ye wished to pretend to be his friend.

Finally, Chen Ping'an looked at the small grave mound and softly said, “Having such a brother, such a brother-in-law, and having me, Chen Ping'an, as a friend—what an incredible thing that is.”

Inside the state city inn, the night was deep.

On New Year’s Eve, the three guests did not spend money to have a celebratory dinner prepared, leaving the innkeeper somewhat disappointed.

Chen Ping'an only requested a fire pit and a bag of charcoal, and with Ma Duyi and the emotionally subdued Zeng Ye, they sat together until around midnight.

There were no round-the-table conversations; they said nothing.

Afterward, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye returned to their rooms.

Chen Ping'an sat alone, guarding the night until dawn.

And thus, a year passed by. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 502: Where Lies the Sword of the Master (Part One)**

According to the customs of the town in L珠洞天 (Li Zhu Dong Tian), on the first day of the new year, households would turn their brooms upside down, and it was considered inauspicious to travel far.

Chen Ping'an decided to have Ma Duyi guide Zeng Ye in her cultivation. After spending time together over the past few days, Chen Ping'an, after careful consideration, had handed over the detailed notes on the secret techniques of ghostly cultivation to Ma Duyi at the end of last year, allowing her to browse through them. If there were any questions or confusions, she could consult Zeng Ye. As fellow cultivators, the differences in their innate talents were immediately apparent. In no time, Ma Duyi was able to provide guidance to Zeng Ye regarding this secret technique, quickly surpassing expectations. Within less than a month, she could help Zeng Ye navigate through the intricacies and resolve difficulties.

Fortunately, Zeng Ye took this in stride. Instead of feeling discouraged, dejected, or envious, she became more determined and diligent in her own training, compensating for her shortcomings through hard work. 

This brought Chen Ping'an a sense of relief. The ability to accept fate while striving to transcend it is a rare and admirable quality in cultivators; as long as one perseveres, achieving greatness later in life is not a distant dream.

On this day, Chen Ping'an sat alone in the sunlit courtyard of the inn, where he had opened a book box that had been left in the muddy snow. He was documenting each book, contemplating the future opportunity to return them to their original owner. The private library seals stamped on the pages bore the names “Water Flows, Clouds Drift” and “The Jagged Old Man.” It shouldn’t be too difficult for Zeng Ye to trace back to that scholarly family that had fled south.

Around noon, Chen Ping'an received a message via flying sword from Qingxia Island. It was a flying sword from the Longquan Peak of the Dali Dynasty. Since Chen Ping'an was not at Shujian Lake, it had to remain temporarily at the sword room of Qingxia Island. Liu Zhimiao sent a flying sword to inquire how Chen Ping'an wished to handle the matter. Chen Ping'an replied, informing Liu Zhimiao of their current location with three horses, and requested him to make a trip to deliver the message.

That evening of the first day of the new year, Liu Zhimiao hurried to the state city inn, bringing with him the flying sword from the Divine Spirit of the North Mountain of Dali. 

Chen Ping'an did not open the flying sword from Longquan Peak in front of Liu Zhimiao. As a Nascent Soul Earth Immortal, especially one like Liu Zhimiao, who had hopes of reaching the fifth realm, his magical techniques and powers were numerous. They were merely allies seeking mutual benefits, not friends, so their relationship wasn’t close enough for that.

The two sat across from each other in the inn room.

Liu Zhimiao got straight to the point, “According to your instructions before leaving Qingxia Island, I have quietly lifted the restrictions on the Red Crisp of the Zhuxian Manor. However, I haven’t proactively sent it to Gongliu Island to curry favor with Liu Lao Cheng. Now that Liu Lao Cheng and you are allies, even if friends of friends are not necessarily friends, our relationship with Gongliu Island has softened, thanks to you. Tan Yuanyi made a special visit to Qingxia Island, showing you even more respect. Therefore, apart from delivering the Dali message flying sword to you, I also brought a small gift as a New Year greeting from Qingxia Island. Please don’t refuse; this is a customary practice we’ve followed for many years, where everyone on the island shares in the offerings during the first month.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I am well aware of the customs of Qingxia Island, big and small. So even if you didn’t bring it, I would have reminded you.”

Liu Zhimiao took out a somewhat sparse string of walnut beads, which seemed to have been poorly maintained, with nearly half of them missing. Only eight remained, carved with the likenesses of deities such as the Rain Master, Thunder God, and Lightning Mother. Each was about the size of a thumb, possessing an ancient charm. Liu Zhimiao smiled and said, "You just need to pluck one off and throw it to the ground to command the wind, rain, thunder, and fire. The power of a burst walnut equals the full force of a typical Nascent Soul Earth Immortal's strike. However, each walnut is destroyed upon use, so they are not particularly valuable treasures. Given your current condition, it would be unwise for you to engage in frequent battles, making this quite suitable."

Chen Ping'an accepted it gently and expressed his gratitude, "Indeed, you are very considerate, Liu Island Master."

Liu Zhimiao smiled, “Recently, three significant events have shaken the Zhu Ying Dynasty and all its vassal states. The first is that a sword cultivator hiding in Shujian Lake was pursued for over a thousand miles by a woman in green and a boy in white, ultimately being killed together. The woman in green is the unknown cultivator who previously destroyed the Ancestor Hall of Furong Mountain during the alliance meeting at Gongliu Island. It is rumored that she is a member of the Dali clan. As for the boy in white, his skills are extraordinary, and he possesses a dazzling array of magical artifacts. His pursuit was as carefree as a stroll in the garden, leaving the nine-realm sword cultivator in utter disarray.”

At this point, Liu Zhimiao glanced at Chen Ping'an with a smile.

Chen Ping'an asked, “What does Huang Li Island say about this?”

Liu Zhimiao replied, “After learning of the news, the Earth Immortal couple from Huang Li Island immediately visited Tan Yuanyi, seeking protection, effectively pledging their allegiance to Dali.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “That’s good news.”

Liu Zhimiao continued, “The second event is that General Su Gaoshan has declared he will breach the capital of Shihai Kingdom before the Lantern Festival this year. Those who don’t want to perish alongside the Han family of Shihai only need to display the Dali door gods, Yuan and Cao, at their gates during the first month to avoid being affected by the war. If the Dali cavalry breaks into the city and a noble household hasn’t hung the door gods, they will be seen as complicit with the Han family. After the city is breached, all households must replace their door gods with those of Dali within three days to avoid any disturbances. Any household that fails to do so will be recorded for future reckoning.”

Chen Ping'an murmured, “Planning in advance and winning hearts is the way to go.”

Liu Zhimiao’s eyes glinted with amusement, “As for the third event, in a time of peace, this would be quite a stir, but right now, it’s hardly noticeable. The emperor's favored prince of Shihai Kingdom, Han Jingxin, suddenly died in a remote area, his body mutilated. The royal family’s offerings to Master Zeng are lost, and the kingdom’s top martial artist, Hu Han, has also had his head severed. It is said that the poet Xu Mao used the two heads as a token to present to General Su Gaoshan of Dali on a snowy night, thus earning a promotion to the fourth-rank official of Dali, the Qianwu Niu General. He has truly made a remarkable ascent; gaining military merit in Dali is no easy feat.”

Liu Zhimiao set down two wine bowls on the table. Chen Ping'an took down his sword nurturing gourd and smiled. Liu Zhimiao, understanding, retracted one bowl, knowing that this accountant wouldn’t be using his own, but a few table manners were still necessary. Chen Ping'an poured Liu Zhimiao a bowl of wine while he drank from the gourd.

After taking a sip, Chen Ping'an slowly said, “There’s no doubt about it; I’m the one who killed him. As for those two heads, Xu Mao took them. I didn’t kill Xu Mao; he helped me avoid disaster, and we both got what we needed.”

“Indeed,” Liu Zhimiao laughed heartily, “Shihai Kingdom is neither big nor small. To have encountered the tip of your sword, it seems Han Jingxin was not destined to be emperor in this life. But to be honest, among the princes, he was the one most favored by the emperor, and his personal schemes were the most profound. He had the best opportunities, but alas, this young lad sought his own demise.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “Liu Island Master, there’s one thing I’ve never understood. Why have all the vassal states of the Zhu Ying Dynasty chosen to stand against the Dali cavalry to the bitter end? On Baoping Continent, as vassals of a great dynasty, it shouldn’t be so resolute. It’s not like there’s such a small voice of dissent in the court. From the Huangting Kingdom of the Great Sui to the northern territories beyond the Guanh Lake Academy… only here seems illogical.”

Chen Ping'an tapped the table with his finger, “This doesn’t fit the norm.”

Liu Zhimiao hesitated for a moment, then lifted his wine bowl and took a sip, slowly replying, “Each faction has its own bets. While Baoping Continent may be small, Dali has garnered support from the core branches of the Mohist School, Yin-Yang School, and the military factions centered around Zhenwu Mountain. They have all chosen to align with the Song family of Dali. So, as the most powerful dynasty in Baoping Continent, it is reasonable for the Zhu Ying Dynasty to have the backing of the major and minor branches among various schools. To my knowledge, there are strong supports from farming, medicinal, and commercial factions, as well as the strategist factions. The Zhu Ying Dynasty boasts many sword cultivators, which signifies great fortune, and their close ties with the Guanh Lake Academy make it unsurprising that the Dali cavalry faces resistance here.”

Chen Ping'an felt enlightened, raising his sword nurturing gourd, while Liu Zhimiao lifted his wine bowl, and they each drank.

Liu Zhimiao, dressed in simple white linen, appeared as a humble hermit from the cold mountains. However, upon closer inspection, he exuded an air of celestial grace.

Chen Ping'an suddenly sighed, “I almost forgot that Liu Island Master is a Nascent Soul cultivator.”

Liu Zhimiao leisurely savored his drink, a content smile on his face. Through the window, the rooftops outside were still covered with snow, and he said, “I nearly forgot that you hail from Mud Bottle Alley, Chen Ping'an.”

Chen Ping'an leaned forward suddenly, handing over the sword nurturing gourd. Liu Zhimiao paused for a moment before gently clinking his wine bowl against it.

Chen Ping'an took a hearty drink and, with a serious expression, said, “Earlier, I was mistaken. We can indeed consider each other half-friends, regardless of whether we are foes or allies.”

Liu Zhimiao took back his wine bowl, not rushing to drink. He gazed at the young man in the green cotton robe, whose features were gradually deepening with a weary spirit. Only his once-clear and bright eyes were becoming progressively more profound, but not murky, devoid of the turbulent depths of hidden schemes. Liu Zhimiao finished the wine in his bowl and rose, saying, “I won’t delay your important matters any longer. If Shujian Lake can be resolved, let’s not aspire to be friends. I only hope that when we meet again in the future, we can sit down for a drink, enjoy a few casual words, and part ways when the mood strikes. We can drink again upon our next reunion; that’s all.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Once we part from Shujian Lake, if you ascend to the fifth realm, it will be a different world, and you may not have such sentiments then.”

Liu Zhimiao smiled, “You cultivate your heart at an impressive pace, and by then, you might not have the same mindset as today.”

The two spoke in unison, “A kindred spirit indeed.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 503: Where Is the Master’s Sword? (Part 2)

After Liu Zhimao departed, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye cautiously approached and took their seats.

Liu Zhimao neither displayed celestial powers to create a secluded realm nor did Chen Ping'an conceal anything during their conversation. Hence, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye could still faintly hear the lively chatter from their side.

Ma Duyi's expression was complex, while Zeng Ye looked utterly puzzled.

Chen Ping'an didn't elaborate much; he simply inquired about some of Zeng Ye's cultivation hurdles and explained them thoroughly, providing not just detailed insights but also occasionally offering profound guidance. Although Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye inspired each other with their respective efforts, Chen Ping'an's insights were still slightly superior, at least in his view. What Chen Ping'an considered mundane words, however, sparked profound realizations in Ma Duyi, whose aptitude was better than Zeng Ye's.

It was as if an immortal was guiding a waterfall, while Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye could only stand beneath it, catching drops with bowls and pots to quench their thirst.

Once Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye left, Chen Ping'an unlocked the restrictions on the flying sword from Dali's Piyun Mountain.

It was an unexpected revelation.

A Vice Minister of Rites from the Dali Song clan had personally visited Longquan County. Aside from inspecting matters related to the local martial and literary temples, he had secretly paid a visit to the Mountain God, Wei Bo, proposing a new suggestion.

Recently, the Dali court had "redeemed" many mountain peaks abandoned by celestial forces. They intended to leverage this to strike a significant deal with Chen Ping'an. The remaining gold and copper debts owed to Chen Ping'an by Dali could allow him to purchase those "mature" mountain tops, which had already been developed into celestial residences and had ready-made protective formations. Should Chen Ping'an agree to this, along with the previously acquired peaks of Luopao Mountain and Pearl Mountain, he would come to control nearly thirty percent of the western mountainous territory of Longquan County. Without discussing the amount of spiritual energy (Qi) nurtured by these mountains, just in terms of scale, Chen Ping'an could almost rival the eminent sage, Ruan Qiong.

Wei Bo openly stated in a secret letter that this was an extraordinary opportunity, yet it bore substantial hidden risks. The entanglements between Chen Ping'an and the Dali Song clan would only deepen, making it much harder to sever ties in the future than it had been with the Xu clan from Qingfeng City, who had hastily sold off their mountains when the situation turned dire. The Dali court had made it clear that once Chen Ping'an possessed such a vast territory, which had been reduced from a celestial realm to a blessed ground, he would need to sign a special contract, with Piyun Mountain as the object of the mountain covenant. The Dali court, Wei Bo, and Chen Ping'an would jointly sign a mountain pact of the second highest rank in the dynasty. The highest pact would require the simultaneous appearance of the Five Sacred Mountain Gods, along with the Dali Emperor's seal and a pact with a particular cultivator, but such a grand alliance could only involve upper realm cultivators and would significantly impact the Song clan's lineage.

Wei Bo admitted in the letter that trusting him, Wei Bo, and signing this mountain covenant with Chen Ping'an could be one of the considerations, but it shouldn't carry too much weight.

When it came to matters of the Dao, one had to be extremely cautious.

In the closing lines of his secret letter, Wei Bo added that there was no rush; he could help delay the situation for six months to a year, allowing time for careful consideration. Even if the situation in Baopingzhou became clear, with the Dali Song clan conquering the Zhu Ying Dynasty and continuing southward, both he, as the intermediary, and Chen Ping'an, as the buyer, would simply need to be a bit shameless and stubborn to finalize a deal with Dali. Business on the mountains should be just like that—nothing to be ashamed of.

Chen Ping'an then opened a small wooden box and sent a message via the flying sword to Liu Zhimao, using the exclusive sword mound of his island to contact Piyun Mountain. He only needed to reply with two words: "It’s possible."

After finishing these tasks, he walked to the window. The long spear-wielding generals of the Shihau Kingdom, like Xu Mao, were poised to rise significantly amid the chaos. If Dali were to conquer the Zhu Ying Dynasty and advance southward, the now mid-level military officer Xu Mao would be able to command a division of elite Dali cavalry, significantly bolstering his military achievements. The key lay in Xu Mao's character and skill, which far surpassed that of Prince Han Jingxin; Xu Mao's only shortcoming was his birth status.

Su Gaoshan was said to also hail from a cold-clan bordering the nation, much like Xu Mao of the Shihau Kingdom, which likely contributed to Xu Mao's extraordinary promotion. If he had allied himself with the general Cao Ping from another army, he would have received rewards as well but would not have attained the rank of a fourth-grade military official directly. His rise in the military and political realms would be considerably slower compared to Xu Mao.

On this northern journey, Chen Ping'an passed through numerous counties and cities. Su Gaoshan's knights could not be said to have acted without restraint, but many of Dali's border military regulations could still be perceived. For instance, there was a violent confrontation in a dilapidated county town near Zhou Guonian's hometown, where a Shihau national hero risked his life to assassinate a secretary. In response, Dali swiftly dispatched a cavalry unit to aid the town, collaborating with accompanying cultivators. The leaders of the assassination were executed on the spot, their heads hung on city walls, while several Shihau officials, including the deputy magistrate, were imprisoned pending their fate, with their families placed under house arrest. However, there were no unnecessary repercussions involved. During this period, an incident occurred that caught the attention of both Chen Ping'an and Su Gaoshan. A young man, on a snowy night, climbed the city walls and stole the head of Chen Ping'an’s master. Although he was discovered by the soldiers on the city walls, he managed to escape, only to be intercepted soon after by two military secretaries. This incident could have been serious or trivial; it was merely an isolated case amidst the advancing army. Layers of reports eventually reached General Su Gaoshan, who summoned the young martial man from the Shihau Kingdom outside the main tent. After a conversation, Su Gaoshan tossed a large pouch of silver to the young man, granting him the right to bury his master with full honors. The only stipulation was that the young man should recognize the true culprit behind this tragedy, which was Su Gaoshan himself. He would not be permitted to seek trouble with Dali's border troops, especially with the civil officials; if he desired revenge, he was to confront Su Gaoshan directly in the future.

This story spread widely in the bureaucratic and martial circles of central Shihau Kingdom.

Then came the first major matter that Liu Zhimao had mentioned.

A girl in blue and a boy in white.

Chen Ping'an smiled.

His mind stirred, and he leaped onto the windowsill, lightly tapping his toes to ascend the rooftop, walking leisurely without any particular destination, simply strolling across the rooftops.

His sword nurturing gourd was still on the table, and he had not brought along the bamboo sword or the large imitation yellow sword.

He felt free-spirited, unconfined.

The world was vast, and he could go wherever he pleased.

Finally, Chen Ping'an stopped on a rooftop’s eaves, closed his eyes, and began practicing the sword furnace stances. However, he soon gave up and instead listened carefully, as if he could hear the sound of melting snow in the air.

A young man dressed in light armor, a military secretary of Dali stationed in the city, was also walking on the rooftops. Today was uneventful, and he was not technically on duty. He was holding a jug of wine that had been heated at the hearth inside, stopping at the eaves a few dozen steps away. He smiled and reminded Chen Ping'an in refined dialect: "Enjoying the scenery is fine. If you wish to go to the city walls, that’s alright too. I happen to be out for a stroll as well and can accompany you."

This was a kind and courteous remark. With Dali's cavalry moving like a hot knife through butter, everyone outside Dali was naturally considered an outsider and a vassal. However, the young cultivator’s words also carried a warning undertone.

Chen Ping'an shook his head with a smile. "No need, I’ll be heading back shortly."

The young cultivator was taken aback, then burst into laughter, raising his wine jug high. It turned out that this young man in the blue cotton robe spoke the most fluent Dali dialect.

Thus, this young military secretary, who had been on the battlefield for nearly a decade, declared loudly: "The clouds of Yizhou are above the county, Guan Yiran!"

Chen Ping'an hesitated; it didn’t seem appropriate to introduce himself, so he could only clasp his fists and smile apologetically at the man.

Guan Yiran laughed heartily, saying: "If you ever find yourself in trouble in the future, you can seek out our Dali cavalry. Wherever our hooves tread, it's all part of Dali’s territory!"

Chen Ping'an's expression grew distant, unsure of how to respond.

On the third day of the first month, Chen Ping'an and his two companions departed the city, continuing northward, drawing closer to the northern border of the Shihau Kingdom.

The heavy snow melted away.

Spring urged the willows to bloom, and the sun's rays shimmered on the locust trees.

Along the way, Zeng Ye picked up quite a few treasures, such as a seal engraved with "Li Cao Zao," belonging to the general of the Shihau Kingdom, Guan Fang. Many antiques, which had been discarded along the roadside, were valuable items worth dozens or even hundreds of gold pieces in times of peace. Now, however, they were treated like worthless refuse. There were also some precious paintings and calligraphy that had been soaked in mud and nearly destroyed, or rare collectibles that had been sold off to pawn shops in unaffected counties. Surprisingly, Ma Duyi was quite the treasure hunter, and Zeng Ye was even more so. Whenever they set up a porridge shop or a pharmacy in a local area, they would eagerly check out the pawn shops during their free time. They had borrowed from Chen Ping'an twice, and although the celestial currency they acquired wasn’t much—only twelve snowflake coins in total—exchanging them for gold and silver from the worldly dynasty was not easy. They had to go to celestial ferry points or celestial inns. Fortunately, one of the female spirits in the fox fur charm, who hails from a first-rate but not top-tier celestial cave in the Shihau Kingdom, had her wishes fulfilled by Chen Ping'an. He exchanged some celestial money with that celestial family, giving it to Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye to handle. For this, Ma Duyi even insisted that Chen Ping'an craft a large bamboo box specifically for storing gold and silver.

Chen Ping'an had no objections, as long as it didn’t delay their cultivation and important matters, he allowed them to proceed.

That day, in a small county town near the border, after Chen Ping'an made contact with the local authorities, the familiar Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi began setting up the porridge shop and pharmacy. They dared not be careless in this task. Only after completing their daily responsibilities could they excitedly visit the major pawn shops to search for treasures. Although Chen Ping'an did not involve himself in the details and rarely spoke, the two had spent enough time with him to understand his style of operation. Chen Ping'an kept a keen eye on everything and saw deeper than they did.

As for the items they had acquired from the pawn shops with the credit they had borrowed from Chen Ping'an, they temporarily stored them within Chen Ping'an's immediate vicinity.

This was thanks to Ma Duyi's noble lineage; before her death, she was a minor overseer in the treasure workshop of her island, possessing a discerning eye far superior to that of the young Zeng Ye.

Later, Chen Ping'an worried that Ma Duyi might also make mistakes in judgment. After all, the items they purchased were mostly miscellaneous and had trickled down from affluent families in the Shihau Kingdom, each unique in its own right. He invited a fifth realm cultivator's spirit residing in a replica of the Liuli Pavilion to help Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye assess these items. The spirit, which had been turned into a ghost general by the refining of the Zhulian House's Ma Yuan, quickly became addicted to the task. Initially, it belittled the items Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi had collected, deeming them worthless. Then, it insisted on leaving the replica Liuli Pavilion to help the two foolish ones buy truly good things. To this end, it even went so far as to manifest in the form of a beautiful woman, a former observer of the sea with considerable cultivation. The sacrifice it made was significant, indicating that Chen Ping'an's records in the accounts were not mere exaggerations. He was indeed a collector at heart, a fact that the cultivators of the “broken goods” category often remarked upon. The accounts even recorded a comment from a certain earth immortal cultivator years ago, stating that if this long-struggling observer of the sea had not wasted so much on such items, he might have already attained the Dragon Gate Realm.

Chen Ping'an allowed the old cultivator to take on an alluring appearance of a beautiful woman, yet he still displayed a bold, carefree sitting posture. After all, Chen Ping'an had seen similar scenes before; to be honest, he found the earlier scenes of a certain “Du Mao,” who was always coy and delicate, far more repulsive.

That evening, Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, accompanied by a ghost each, went back to the various pawn shops in the city. The saying goes, “if you often walk by the river, you will inevitably get your shoes wet.” The items that even an observer of the sea’s old ghost would find appealing would surely tempt ordinary cultivators. Even the celestial scholars would travel to war-torn nations for a rare opportunity to make a profit. Hidden among many heirlooms of wealthy families might be a few spiritual tools containing spiritual energy (Qi) that the families overlooked. Encountering such items could yield profits of ten or even hundreds of snowflake coins. Thus, Zeng Ye and the others sometimes came across fellow cultivators. Previously, in a large city, a conflict almost broke out with several celestial scholars from a top cave in the Shihau Kingdom. Each side had its own reasons, and neither could claim to have acted unjustly. Ultimately, it was Chen Ping'an who cleaned up the mess, leading Zeng Ye and the others to abandon that spiritual tool, while the other party took a step back and invited the wild cultivator “Mr. Chen” to a drink, resulting in a pleasant conversation. However, Ma Duyi still privately complained about Chen Ping'an for quite some time after that.

Chen Ping'an visited a dog meat shop in a bustling market, marking his second visit. In truth, Chen Ping'an didn’t enjoy eating dog meat, or rather, he had never eaten it before.

However, the shop also sold other foods, and there he sat alone at a table, not drinking, speaking in the unfamiliar official dialect of the Shihau Kingdom, while the adjacent tables were filled with patrons joyously enjoying steaming dog meat stews, toasting and exchanging drinks. The young man in the blue cotton robe stood out in stark contrast.

Fortunately, the shop had been passed down for generations and had a history of over a hundred years, lacking any pretentiousness. The old man at the front was the shopkeeper, his son was the cook, and the grandson, who was said to be a well-known little scholar in the nearby streets, often drew jesting remarks from customers about the shop's future. The witty old man and the somewhat wooden son simply replied that it was all fate; what could they do? Even the usually unsmiling man would show a hint of pride upon hearing such jests, feeling fortunate that, amidst their ancestral graves, they had finally produced a promising seed for academic success. What could be more fortunate than that?

 ### Chapter 504: Where Is the Sword of the Master? (Part Two)

Even in the midst of chaos, there will come a day of peace.

The dog meat shop tucked away in a narrow alley was bustling with customers tonight, doing a thriving business. Last summer, when the Great Li barbarians breached the city, there were hardly any casualties. The army continued to march south, leaving behind a handful of Great Li soldiers who were said to be proficient in the local dialect, stationed near the magistrate's residence. They kept a low profile, thanks in part to the cowardice of the local magistrate, who had fled with his gold and silver, reportedly leaving even the official seal behind. He had changed into a blue scholar's robe and, on a deep night when the hooves of the Great Li horses were still far off, quietly slipped out of the city with the help of his loyal attendants, heading south without any intention of returning to the court.

Inside the shop, a dark-skinned mute boy, thin and wiry, was busy attending to patrons and serving tea. He wasn’t particularly bright. It was said that he was a refugee from the border, and the kind-hearted owner had taken him in as a helper. After half a year, he remained an unlikable boy, and the shop's regular customers preferred not to deal with him.

As dusk approached and the number of customers dwindled, the savory aroma of dog meat still lingered in the air.

Chen Ping'an ordered a pot of local liquor and took a seat near the entrance. The old owner was drinking with a regular customer, already intoxicated and red-faced, proudly bragging about his precious grandson. For someone who could only handle a cup or two, he was now boasting as if he could drink three times that. As he drank, he reminded himself to be cautious, since drinking too much would mean less profit. In this troubled world, it had become harder to sell dog meat, whether in the county town or nearby villages. The number of customers had decreased, and the coins in their pockets were far less than before. Therefore, he had to be frugal, especially with the expenses for his grandson’s studies, which were considerable. He couldn’t afford to seem overly stingy; it would only invite contempt from the other children.

Scholars, after all, cared about reputation.

The skinny, dark boy was still busy cleaning up the remnants of a table’s meal, his back turned to Chen Ping'an.

After finishing his food and two bowls of rice, Chen Ping'an ordered a few more side dishes to accompany his drink. He hadn’t drunk much, but his chopsticks hadn’t stopped moving, leaving the plates nearly empty.

Suddenly, he called out the boy’s name and asked, “I’m expecting a guest soon. Besides the free-range chicken, do you have any freshly caught river carp in the water tank out back?”

The boy nodded indifferently.

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Then go tell the chef it’s time to prepare the dish. Once it’s ready, my friend can join us at the table. Oh, and add a serving of stir-fried spring bamboo shoots with pork.”

The boy nodded again and went to the back courtyard, gesturing to the man resting in the kitchen. The man, having just caught his breath, cursed lightly and stood up, ready to slaughter the chicken and gut the fish. After all, in business, no one wanted to lose out on coin. The boy watched the man approach the water tank with a complicated expression before quietly leaving the kitchen to grab the largest chicken from the coop, teasing the man that it was meant to nourish his son’s body and that he should exchange it for another. The boy then swapped it for a smaller one, but the man was still dissatisfied, insisting that the customer wouldn’t notice the difference in size. Ultimately, the man went to the coop himself and picked out a larger chicken, handing it to the boy, who was somewhat skilled at slaughtering. Meanwhile, the man caught a lively river carp.

The boy cast a glance at the dog cage in the corner but quickly averted his gaze.

The first plate of braised river carp was served on the table.

The boy noticed that the guest he was told about hadn’t arrived yet.

Chen Ping'an simply said to wait until the second dish was ready.

By the time the stir-fried bamboo shoots with pork and the chicken pieces with ginger and scallions were served, the boy noticed that the guest still hadn’t come.

He was about to leave when the sickly-looking man in the cotton robe suddenly smiled and said, “All the dishes are ready; we’re just waiting for you to take a seat.”

The boy looked confused.

In the dog meat shop, only one table of customers remained, and the old owner was already slurring his words, trying hard to persuade them to drink more. It seemed that the thought of offering discounts had long been forgotten.

Chen Ping'an said to the boy, “You must have already realized that I’ve guessed your identity, and you’ve also figured out that I am a cultivator. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have deliberately avoided me last time, serving the dishes while avoiding eye contact. Since that’s the case, my invitation to share a meal isn’t a big deal. You’ve brought me the food and drink; I should be the one who’s worried. What do you fear?”

The boy hesitated.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the distant table and smiled. “Don’t worry; the old owner is already drunk, and the customers at that table are just ordinary folks. They can’t hear our conversation.”

The boy sat across from Chen Ping'an but didn’t reach for his chopsticks.

Chen Ping'an picked up a piece of river carp with his chopsticks, leaned forward, and placed it in the boy's rice bowl. He then added some stir-fried bamboo shoots and chicken pieces, also placing them in the boy’s bowl.

The boy frowned tightly, staring hard at the strange traveler.

Chen Ping'an then served himself some food, chewed slowly, and after a moment asked, “How many people do you plan to kill? The man who wields the ladle definitely has to die. The old owner, who has a knack for ‘dog handling,’ has likely bought and stolen countless dogs in his lifetime, and he will die too. But what about that child learning to read? Do you intend to kill him too? As for those familiar faces who are used to eating dog meat in this shop, how many of them do you remember? Will you also kill them?”

The boy placed his hands on his knees, fists clenched tightly. His eyes were cold as he lowered his voice and hoarsely said, “Are you going to stop me?”

Chen Ping'an countered, “What would happen if I did stop you? What would happen if I didn’t?”

The boy replied firmly, “If you dare to stop me, I will dare to kill you!”

Chen Ping'an, still holding his chopsticks, smiled and extended his empty hand, signaling for the boy to eat first. “Let’s not even discuss whether you have the ability to kill me. Why don’t we finish our meal and, once we’re full, see who lives or dies? This table of dishes, at today’s market price, must be worth at least seven or eight coins, and that’s still a fair price from this dog meat shop. In those bustling taverns in the county town, they’d probably charge one or two and a half coins, and if you can’t pay, they’d toss you out.”

The boy stared into the young man's eyes. Moments later, he began to eat, taking generous helpings. If he was going to kill this cultivator today, he might as well have a hearty meal first!

As the boy began to eat, Chen Ping'an paused, pouring the last bit of liquor from the jug into his cup. He took small sips while pinching a few remaining peanuts from the plate with his fingers.

After finishing his drink and side dishes, Chen Ping'an rested his hands in his sleeves, remaining seated.

The boy wiped his mouth and set down his bowl and chopsticks.

Chen Ping'an slowly said, “I can understand why you would want to kill someone after witnessing dogs being slaughtered and patrons eating meat, but I cannot accept it.”

The boy let out a cold laugh.

Chen Ping'an continued, “You have your reasons and justifications, and you’re even willing to pay the price of your own life for them. But I hope you understand more about this world. For instance, after eating river carp, free-range chicken, and pork today, when you embark on your path of cultivation, you’ll enjoy even more delicacies from the mountains. As a half-immortal from the mountains, as long as you don’t die prematurely, you’ll find yourself invited to various feasts throughout your life. You could be a guest or a host, and regardless, you’ll never have to worry about not having enough food, except for dog meat, right?”

The boy looked dazed.

Chen Ping'an continued, “If you take this step today, even without my intervention, you would be hunted down and killed by the Great Li cultivators monitoring the city. You’d be doomed. Even if you manage to escape this county, how many more people who eat dog meat will you kill? Will it be ten tonight? Fifty? A hundred? A thousand? If you’re going to die, you won’t regret it, right?”

The boy lowered his head.

Chen Ping'an said, “Since I’ve seen this, I won’t let you kill anyone here. You might think I’m being unreasonable and bullying you with my power, but that doesn’t matter. In this world, speaking reason is a complex and often unlikable matter. Similarly, in the eyes of the old owner and his son, those customers who might die inexplicably, and perhaps the child who survives but can never read again, they’ll view you as unreasonable and utterly irrational as well. This is something you should consider before taking a life.”

The boy looked up.

The man seemed genuinely concerned about the small amount of silver. Seeing that the boy had stopped eating, he picked up his chopsticks, took a piece of stir-fried bamboo shoots with pork, finished it, then took another piece of braised river carp. He said, “The reason I’m doing this and saying all this is that I see hesitation and struggle in you. You believe the old owner and the chef deserve to die, but they also have their good sides. You should know that I’ve met many people, and even if they are people, they are far less human than you. They don’t even compare to you, not even close. That’s why I’m willing to treat you to this meal, and…”

Chen Ping'an smiled, took out a piece of broken silver and placed it on the table, then took out a small copper coin and slid it near the boy's bowl. “Let me suggest a possibility: this small copper coin is a loan. Whether you pay it back or not is up to you; you can return it to me ten or a hundred years later. If you don’t kill anyone today, you can endure this inner turmoil, which I know is difficult, but if you avoid killing, you can use that money to save more of your kind. There are countless ways to do this. For example, you could leverage your cultivation to become a half-immortal in the eyes of a county magistrate, helping him deal with odd occurrences. After all, in small places, you won’t encounter someone like me, an ‘unreasonable’ cultivator. You can manage those troublesome spirits, and perhaps you can say to the magistrate, ‘Don’t allow the sale of dog meat in your jurisdiction…’ Or you could become a wealthy merchant and buy out all the dogs in the county, forcing many dog meat shops to change their trade… Or you could diligently cultivate and establish your own mountain sect, setting rules within a hundred or a thousand miles, one of which could be to treat dogs kindly…”

The boy asked, “Why are you doing this?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and smiled. “Though I’m disappointed with this world and myself, I’ve recently come to understand that no matter the cost, it’s still important to speak reason.”

The boy asked again, “Are you a Confucian?”

Chen Ping'an paused for a moment before shaking his head. “Not quite yet. But I am a swordsman.”

The boy looked slightly taken aback.

“You can borrow more if you need it, but after this, we’ll have to settle accounts clearly.”

Chen Ping'an slowly stood up. “Think more about it. I don’t hope you’ll pay me back that small copper coin too soon. Even if you’re clever enough to change to a more distant county, that would be fine with me, as long as I don’t hear or see you. However, if you can find another path to follow, I would be very pleased to treat you to this meal, and it wouldn’t be a waste of money.”

Chen Ping'an walked out of the dog meat shop and into the narrow alley alone.

Suddenly, the boy ran out of the shop, catching up with Chen Ping'an, and asked, “Sir, you said I could borrow money from you in the future, but you didn’t tell me your name or where you’re from. If I run out of money, how will I find you?”

“Oh, that.” Chen Ping'an paused, scratching his head. “I was just being polite, saying some empty words that don’t require money.”

The boy broke into a brilliant smile.

It was the first time he had laughed so heartily since taking human form.

Chen Ping'an reached out and ruffled the boy's hair. “My name is Chen Ping'an. For now, I’m wandering in the Country of Shihai, and later, I’ll return to Qingxia Island at Shujian Lake. Just focus on your cultivation from now on.”

Chen Ping'an continued on his way.

The boy shouted loudly, “Mr. Chen, the old owner and his family are actually good people, so I will offer a very high price that they can’t refuse to buy the shop from them. Then their grandchildren and children can study well, and they’ll have their own school and library, with excellent teachers! After that, I’ll return to the mountains and cultivate diligently!”

Without a sword on him, or even a sword on his back, yet still calling himself a swordsman, the man simply turned his back to the boy and raised his arm, giving a thumbs-up.

The boy called out one last time, “Sir, where is your sword?”

The man walked forward with big strides. “It’s in my heart.”

After a brief pause, the young swordsman laughed heartily and added, “Very fast!”

In the dim alleyway, only the three words lingered softly.

“Very fast!”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 505: Makes Sense, Very Much So

The issues concerning the porridge shop and the apothecary had been resolved. Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye thought they would continue their journey as usual toward the border of the Stone Feather Kingdom. There were two men with military backgrounds from the border troops, and their wishes were connected to this place. Though the people could not return to their roots, their hearts still longed for their hometown.

However, Chen Ping'an lingered for another day. As dusk fell, he stopped at the city gate, watching from a distance as a thin, dark-haired boy left the county town. He made a brief visit to the now-closed dog meat shop in the narrow alley, where the two guardian deities of the Great Li—Yuan and Cao—were posted on the walls outside. Only then did Chen Ping'an return to the inn.

Earlier at the city gate, he had encountered Guan Yiran, a military cultivator accompanying the Great Li army. Intentionally dismissing his accompanying guard, Guan stood alone with Chen Ping'an at the gate and quietly asked, “Are we fishing for a big catch by temporarily letting the tiger return to the mountain, in order to discover this little demon's place of enlightenment and find one or two opportunities for celestial objects? Or shall we let this little demon go, considering it a good fate?”

Creatures from the mountains and rivers could take on human forms, indicating they had great fortune. They might have stumbled into an abandoned immortal's cave or consumed a miraculous herb that condensed the spiritual energy of the world. Either way, tracking down the former or directly refining the latter would yield considerable unexpected wealth.

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “It’s the latter.”

Guan Yiran sighed with regret. “What a pity. If you hadn’t shown up, I had two colleagues who were clamoring to catch the little demon hiding in the dog meat shop. But since you’ve intervened, I’ll persuade them to give up. After all, it was just a side endeavor. They have military duties to attend to. However, if you had chosen the former, we could have worked together.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “By me stepping in, wouldn’t that reduce your colleagues’ share? Wouldn’t that make it difficult for you?”

Guan Yiran smiled. “My two friends, although they are cultivators, are more military men from the Great Li army. So, your words and intentions are enough. It’s rare to meet a fellow townsman away from home, and while we can be a bit informal, it’s best to maintain some courtesy. If not, that’s fine too. At worst, we can pretend we don’t know each other next time we meet, and everything will go according to the laws of Great Li and military regulations.”

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement. “That’s sound reasoning.”

Guan Yiran laughed heartily, “I’m glad to have met such a promising fellow countryman in a place so far from home, ten thousand miles away.”

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists. “I can’t reveal my identity now, but if the opportunity arises in the future, I must invite you to drink, Brother Guan.”

Guan Yiran, the military secretary of the Great Li, raised his arm and lightly knocked his chest plate. “I’ll hold you to that! Just to be clear, on the battlefield, if you save me, I won’t care if you owe me your life, but if you owe me a drink, even the Heavenly King can’t help you!”

This unexpected reunion of fellow townsmen in a foreign land was quite enjoyable.

As the young man in the green cotton robe moved away from the city gate, two military cultivators clad in the specialized light armor of the Great Li’s arsenal approached slowly—one was a strong young man, and the other, a slender woman.

The woman glanced at Guan Yiran, who seemed somewhat reluctant to leave. Curiously, she asked, “Yiran, this year’s spring hasn’t brought good omens. You’ve squandered so much money on celestial matters and yet you’re so happy?”

Guan Yiran chuckled. “I’m happy; it’s priceless to find joy.”

The strong man remarked, “A young cultivator who can easily part with a small fortune, and yet shows no desire for that little demon, even going as far as to escort it to the city gate. Moreover, the porridge shop and apothecary he set up in the city, according to intelligence, are not just local affairs, but widespread. I wouldn’t believe anyone else could have such a compassionate heart for a mountain cultivator, but looking at his words and actions, it all makes sense. I think Yiran did nothing wrong; being from the same hometown, it’s only right to have a friend worth sharing a drink with.”

The graceful young woman, wielding a massive sword, complained, “You men are all the same. As soon as you encounter someone appealing, you like to puff yourselves up. Is it really necessary?”

Guan Yiran replied seriously, “Qie, if you talk like that about us men, I’m not pleased. I’m much wealthier than those from Yushan House; there’s no need for me to play pretend. Who was it that said I’m just a spoiled son of a wealthy family, that even my farts carry the smell of copper?”

“You can’t spit ivory from a dog’s mouth!” The slender woman, as flexible as a spring willow, punched Guan Yiran on the shoulder, knocking him back a few steps. The woman turned and walked back toward the city gate.

Guan Yiran grimaced, rubbing his shoulder in pain, and the man from Yushan House wore a look of schadenfreude.

The girl was a soldier from the Wind and Snow Temple. While most cultivators serving in the Great Li’s cavalry held mid to high-ranking military positions, the woman named Qi had chosen a different career path. However, the Great Li’s border troops found this not unusual; soldiers from the Wind and Snow Temple often preferred to be solitary wanderers after descending the mountain, and those few women who did so tended to serve as close attendants to significant military leaders.

Yushan House embraced Guan Yiran’s shoulder and whispered, “Yiran, we’ve known each other for seven or eight years now. I used to think you were just a seedling from the capital, a type that couldn’t rise high or sink low, or else you wouldn’t have been sent to that shabby place for nearly three years, always at the bottom of the border troops. You know how annoying that accent of yours is. Yet Qi, who only joined us two years ago, is already the only one who saw through your family background, insisting you’re from a wealthy family. Why? We, who’ve been freezing our butts off together in the snow, can’t believe it. Are you two already...?”

After freeing herself from Guan Yiran’s grip, Yushan House raised her brows at him.

Guan Yiran sighed, “Who doesn’t know that Qi has long admired her master, the sword immortal Wei Jin?”

He sighed again, “And I already have a fiancée, no less a legitimate daughter of a noble family from the capital. I’ve never met her, which is quite amusing. I’ll only know what she looks like when I lift the bridal veil.”

Yushan House asked curiously, “Which unfortunate girl has to deal with you, a rough soldier from the border?”

“Don’t belittle your brother.” Guan Yiran placed his palm against the hilt of the standard-issue Great Li war knife, walking alongside Yushan House on the streets of a foreign land. He looked around; the streets were adorned with colorful depictions of the Great Li deities, Yuan and Cao. The noble families of the Great Li were few, and the Yuan and Cao families were undoubtedly among the most prominent.

However, two other noble families could contend with the Yuan and Cao families. One resided in the mountains, ignoring mundane affairs, bearing the surname Yu, while the other had its ancestral home in Yizhou and had been residing in the capital for two hundred years. Each year, the noble descendants of this family returning home to pay respect to their ancestors drew the attention of even the Ministry of Rites of Great Li. Legend has it that even the national master of Great Li had once joked with the Emperor, stating that a hundred years ago, during the tumultuous times of eunuchs in power, external relatives holding sway, and rebellions from military governors, which led to chaos in the entire Great Li, if it hadn’t been for this family’s efforts—acting as diligent cobblers of the Great Li dynasty—the nation would have already shattered beyond repair.

Yushan House intertwined his fingers and stretched, cracking his joints. Under the myriad of personal circumstances, this once low-ranking scout of the border troops, who had gradually been promoted to military secretary, casually remarked, “Sometimes, when we old brothers drink and chat, we feel that you’re quite different from us. But exactly how you are different, we can’t quite put into words. We are, after all, the ones getting our eyes washed by the sand every day at the border; none of us have the sharp vision of those official sons.”

Guan Yiran laughed, “I recognize friends of three kinds. On the battlefield, those who dare to die, in the official realm, truly principled scholars, and finally, the good-hearted ones from the mountains.”

Guan Yiran’s expression turned somber. “It’s a pity that it seems the first and third kinds don’t last long. The battlefield speaks for itself; after so many years of life and death, losing the best of brothers, we no longer cry like we used to. As for the third kind, I once knew a young man named Yu Yin, a peer I greatly admired. What made him so remarkable? He made you feel that no matter how bad the world was, with him at the forefront, speaking and acting, that was enough. You only needed to watch his receding figure to feel happy. Yet such a good cultivator died so unjustly. His family and our court chose to downplay the matter for the greater good. I think that’s wrong, but do those big shots care to listen to a nobody like me, Guan Yiran? No. Even if... I bear the surname Guan.”

Yushan House laughed and said, “What’s so great about being named Guan? You’re not even from the esteemed Guan family of Yizhou! Your military registration clearly states you’re from the capital. Don’t you know the character of our general? They’ve already flipped your details upside down. They’ve told us you’re from a third-rate military family in the capital. Forget about the prestigious neighbors; even your family doesn’t have the qualifications to get a small courtyard on the major streets. Are you related to that Guan family at all? Just because General Liu discovered a young scout under his command turned out to be a low-key second-rate military scion from the capital, with ancestors who held the title of a second-rank general and a mouthwatering posthumous title, the general feels he’s been overshadowed. Now he dreams of having a first-rate son among his troops. What a laugh!”

Guan Yiran hesitated. “If one day I die, the general might just laugh and cry at the same time.”

Yushan House was shocked. “What? Are you really a scion of the Guan family from Yizhou?”

Guan Yiran nodded. “Yes, Guan family from Yizhou, I am the direct descendant. There’s no denying it; although my ancestor wasn’t a cultivator, he was incredibly strong, living to a hundred while still able to drink a pound of liquor and eat two pounds of meat in one meal. Even the national master was surprised when he met him.”

Yushan House rolled his eyes. “I believe you when pigs fly! If you’ve met the national master, I’ve met the Emperor!”

Guan Yiran chuckled, “I told you, whether you believe it or not, it’s none of my concern.”

Yushan House asked suspiciously, “Is it true?”

Guan Yiran smiled and nodded. “No lie. Remember that time a couple of years ago during the New Year when I asked for leave to return to the capital? Qi mentioned she had followed a messenger to the capital during the New Year, possibly in Yuhua Alley or Chier Street. At that time, I was visiting homes to pay New Year’s greetings, so Qi caught a glimpse of me. However, those places had strict rules, and she didn’t dare to follow me. Of course, back then, Qi and I didn’t know each other, so there was no reason for her to inquire about my identity.”

Yushan House stealthily reached out, trying to touch Guan Yiran’s head.

Guan Yiran turned his head away, laughing angrily. “What are you doing? Have you gone mad wanting to touch me like I’m Qi?”

Yushan House rubbed his hands together. “I’ve never touched a bigshot in my life, so I want to have a feel. Tsk tsk tsk, a scion of the Guan family! Tonight, I’ll definitely get you drunk, then touch to my heart’s content. I’ll call the old brothers, one by one.”

Guan Yiran chuckled, “If you can pull that off, I’ll go marry your sister, the one you said was a fairy, and then I’ll be calling you brother-in-law every day.”

Yushan House kicked Guan Yiran in the butt.

Guan Yiran took the kick without dodging.

The two continued walking side by side.

Yushan House suddenly sighed, “You should have said something to the brothers when they were leaving, even if just to whisper it to them.”

Guan Yiran was silent for a moment before shaking his head. “I can’t bring it up.”

Yushan House nodded sadly. “That’s true.”

Guan Yiran suddenly smiled. “If one day I die on the battlefield, and the truth comes out, then at least our general and you will have something to boast about to the other cavalry.”

Yushan House shook his head. “Don’t say that.”

Guan Yiran shook his head slowly. “Just because I’m a scion of the Guan family from Yizhou, does that mean I can’t die? Great Li doesn’t have such reasoning.”

Yushan House laughed. “You’re misunderstanding. I just think that however you viewed that young man named Yu Yin back then, that’s how I see you now. In the future, when you become a high-ranking official in our Great Li court, even if you go to the capital looking all dignified, no longer in armor, and I’m still stuck here in the border army, we might never cross paths again, but I’ll still feel... at ease, yes, just more at ease.”

Guan Yiran nodded.

Yushan House curiously asked, “I’m curious, why do all these military scions seem to prefer hiding their identities and coming to be inconspicuous scouts at the border?”

Guan Yiran laughed. “Every self-respecting military scion from Yizhou and Chier Street hopes to have been a genuine border scout in their lifetime, relying on their own abilities to take down enemies and hang their heads as trophies. No matter the reason later, when they return to Yizhou or Chier Street, even the worst young man among the Chier Street families, having served as a border scout, can face off against the sons of those bureaucrats. As long as it’s not too unreasonable, they can just beat the hell out of the other side without fear of implicating their ancestors or families. This has been the case from my grandfather’s generation to mine.”

Yushan House exclaimed in amazement, “That’s possible?”

Guan Yiran stamped his foot, smiling. “That’s why the hooves of the Great Li cavalry can tread here.”

Yushan House quietly asked, “Yiran, do you think there’s a possibility that one day you’ll become the first descendant of the Guan family from Yizhou to receive a posthumous title as a military general?”

“May your words come true.” 

Guan Yiran quickly bowed in thanks, teasing, “Can’t it be for a position like the inspector?”

Yushan House patted Guan Yiran’s shoulder. “Since you’re already a scion of the Guan family, you should be more low-key, tone it down a bit; otherwise, just with that accent, you’ll annoy so many people in the future. What’s next? Are you going to make us brothers feel like we’re dealing with women?”

Guan Yiran rubbed his chin. “That makes sense, very much so.”

 ### Chapter 506: Let’s Wait a Little Longer

At the peak of Sui Mountain.

The Golden-armored Deity sighed in exasperation. “At this rate, how do you expect to survive in the future? That overworked Grand Ritual Master has been dragging his feet for how long now? Even if he once admired your twisted logic, he’s going to run out of goodwill soon.”

The old scholar sat cross-legged, rubbing his ears. “The heavens are going to rain, and mothers are going to marry. Let it be, I suppose.”

The Golden-armored Deity replied slowly, “According to the news, something seems off at the Dragon and Tiger Mountain’s Ancestor Hall. That Fire Dragon Master from the Northern Julu Continent appears to have inadvertently made things worse after that sword was handed over.”

The old scholar chuckled. “How do you know that, in someone else's eyes, a grand disaster isn’t precisely what this outlander Grand Master from Dragon and Tiger Mountain wanted?”

The Golden-armored Deity had merely mentioned this offhandedly. Not to mention an outlander Grand Master, even the main Grand Master of Dragon and Tiger Mountain’s sect wouldn’t concern him in the least.

However, the three Grand Ritual Masters from the Confucian sects, the ones in Baize, the haughty scholar, and the old scholar himself, had all run into walls, returning either empty-handed or without even a face-to-face meeting. Even the main deity of Sui Mountain felt an acute sense of worry.

This was a significant matter, involving the fundamental trends of the world.

The old scholar continued, “My students are few compared to the other prominent literati. It can’t be helped; I’m picky—no one can compare…”

The Golden-armored Deity scoffed. “What a load of nonsense. Is it really so interesting to say this just for me?”

The old scholar nodded. “Better than saying it just to myself.”

The Golden-armored Deity fell silent.

Seeing that the fellow wasn’t going to retort, the old scholar felt a bit disappointed and continued, “As for the eldest, Cui Zhan is the most talented. He loves to split hairs, which is a fine attitude for studying. But Cui Zhan is too clever; he views the world with a sense of pessimism, and he's always been like that.”

“Then there’s the third, Qi Jingchun, whose knowledge is the best—not just the highest but truly comprehensive, worthy of praise even from me, his teacher. If he weren’t under my tutelage but were in the lineage of the Sage of Rites or the Sub-Sage, he might achieve even greater heights. Qi Jingchun approaches the world with optimism.”

“Now about the second, Zuo You, he has the strongest personality, but he’s actually a very good person—exceptionally good. Even when living in a cramped alley during those hard days, I let him manage the finances, and he was much more capable than I, who can’t seem to hold onto a purse. When Cui Zhan wanted to buy chess manuals, Qi Jingchun wanted to buy books, and A Liang wanted to drink, how could I not give them money? Just this skinny bamboo pole of mine, I had to puff up my cheeks to save face. With Zuo You managing the finances, I felt reassured. Although Zuo You’s talent, learning, and disposition aren’t the absolute best among my disciples, he’s the most balanced, naturally composed, and thus he learned swordsmanship quickly, even if it was late. Yes, it was too fast—so fast that it made me a bit anxious back in the day. What would I do if he became the first sword cultivator at the fourteenth realm in the past several thousand years? Looking at him, he’s actually the one most afraid of solitude. Even though he’s been away from the world for over a hundred years, drifting at sea, where do his true thoughts lie? They’re still with me, his teacher, and his fellow disciples... What teacher wouldn’t be fond of such a student?”

“Do you remember that grand Confucian who scolded me so harshly back then? It was indeed somewhat wicked and unscrupulous. Why should I bother arguing with him? Just a minor sage of a humble academy, not even qualified to offer sacrifices. If I went to argue with such a junior, I’d lose face. Zuo You secretly dealt with him, making that fellow cry for his mother. Zuo You was too honest, even admitting fault and running back to me to apologize. Apologize, apologize, for what? He didn’t even think to cover his face and hit back? Afterward, he slipped away and denied everything. What could they do? Come hit me? Can they overcome Zuo You? Even if they could, since Zuo You refuses to acknowledge it, how could that side’s deputy master defeat him? If he can kill him, can’t I kill him too? Alas, Zuo You still lacks common sense. What can I, this long-suffering teacher, do? After all, those little ones are still watching, so I had to punish him, bustling around with Zuo You to apologize, doing this and that, compensating back and forth, so annoying.”

The Golden-armored Deity questioned, “Why would Zuo You be willing to admit fault to you but not to others?”

The old scholar rolled his eyes. “Of course, I clarified the reasoning with Zuo You privately. How could a disciple of the Sage of Letters act so lightly when striking someone? How could he vent his teacher’s grievances like that? After I explained, Zuo You nodded silently, agreeing and promising to be more careful in the future.”

The Golden-armored Deity chuckled. “I’m convinced.”

The old scholar sighed, “As for the fourth, he’s more complicated. He can only be considered a half-disciple. It’s not that I don’t recognize him; it’s that he feels he comes from an inappropriate background and doesn’t want to cause me trouble. So, it’s he who doesn’t acknowledge me. The reasons may differ, but the results are quite similar to my secluded disciple. As for the registered disciples, each has their merits.”

“Among them, Mao Xiaodong is the one most similar to me in terms of teaching and imparting knowledge. Of course, his learning isn’t quite at the level of his teacher. He does everything by the rules, though he still falls short of the so-called ‘going with the flow and not exceeding the bounds’ that the old man talks about. Unfortunately, this kind of thing can’t be pointed out by others; one must come to understand it on their own. The Buddhist concept of self-liberation fits this perfectly. In this regard, the Daoist approach is lacking...”

The old scholar chose not to elaborate further, shifting topics. “As for me, when I argue with someone, I never think I’m entirely right or good. One must know the merits and faults of others. Otherwise, what’s the point of arguing? If all it does is relieve my own frustrations, where does that vast knowledge end up? Knowledge fears becoming rootless, falling from the sky, lofty and impressive to behold, but what significance does it have if it’s only praised by scholars? If it doesn’t touch the ground, doesn’t nurture the soil, doesn’t truly benefit the common people, doesn’t provide them with a ‘place of peace amidst the myriad sufferings of life,’ cramming only some paper words into them, leading them to mistakenly believe that only sages can speak of such principles, it’s exhausting, and what hope is there for the efficacy of education?”

The old scholar stood up, his form hunched, gazing into the distance, murmuring, “Is human nature inherently good? Isn’t that a great virtue? However, there’s an awkward question nestled within: if human nature is inherently good, why is the world so complicated? What has Confucian education truly taught? To lead people towards evil? If so, what then? The old man and the Sage of Rites are waiting, and finally, they’ve waited for me. I said it: human nature is evil. Within a single teaching, we sharpen and temper one another. The key is that I can still stand firm, and I speak reason well, which is why I became the Sage of Letters. However, a more awkward question arises: from your outsider's perspective, you might think the theory of inherently evil human nature can be one of the Confucian schools, which is fine, but can it really become our main doctrine?”

The old scholar answered his own question: “Absolutely not.”

He raised his thumb, pointing at his heart. “This is what I believe.”

Silence ensued.

The Golden-armored Deity rarely sighed, filled with a hint of regret.

The old scholar did not lower his thumb and suddenly sighed, “Thinking of it this way, I truly embody both sage and hero, don’t I? Quite impressive indeed.”

The Golden-armored Deity remained silent.

The old scholar turned his head, exasperated. “Why don’t you argue back a bit? I could use some logic to convince you.”

The Golden-armored Deity replied calmly, “I won’t give you that chance.”

The old scholar responded with a soft “Oh,” feeling pleased. “Then it seems I’ve convinced you through virtue.”

The Golden-armored Deity took a deep breath.

Or else?

The old scholar suddenly became serious. “Don’t rush to chase me away. I also want to learn from Baize and that most unfortunate scholar. Let’s wait a bit longer. Although I don’t know what they’re thinking, I want to wait and see.”

The Golden-armored Deity asked, “What if in the end, it turns out wrong? Will you regret it?”

The old scholar clasped his hands behind his back, squinting and sneering. “Regret? From me, this teacher, to these inner disciples, regardless of their respective paths, regret? Not a chance!”

---

On the golden arched bridge, a sword was embedded in the railing, its tip and a small section of the blade sunk deep, sparks flying, dazzling and brilliant.

A woman sitting nearby placed a paulownia leaf umbrella across her lap. She stood up, opened the seemingly plain oiled-paper umbrella, and glanced up. It flashed and vanished, leaving only the paulownia leaf umbrella suspended in mid-air.

She stepped into a blessed land, right by a well.

That “casually gifted” paulownia leaf umbrella had profound significance, but while the original owner had given it, the new owner may never live to discover the truth of that day.

But what did that have to do with the original owner? It was both a calculation and not a calculation. The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.

Almost instantaneously, a tall old Taoist approached her, smiling. “Long time no see.”

She ignored him, scanning her surroundings before nodding. “In the present context, this is already quite an impressive gesture.”

The old Taoist chuckled. “How else would we discuss the Dao with the Dao Ancestor?”

She shot him a glance.

The old Taoist remained unfazed.

She focused on a certain spot in this Lotus Blossom blessed land, seeming to understand something, and sneered. “You certainly haven’t forgotten your roots.”

The old Taoist laughed heartily, thoroughly pleased. “Going with the flow, a mere effort, upending the universe, submerging an entire continent.”

She frowned.

The old Taoist lamented. “These times are not what they used to be.”

She shook her head. “I merely changed masters.”

The old Taoist fell silent.

This matter was not easy for him to comment on.

She asked, “Is this little piece of land all there is?”

The old Taoist chuckled. “There really can’t be any more.”

She seemed to lose interest, returning disappointed as her figure vanished, rejoining her own realm, putting away the paulownia leaf umbrella.

The old Taoist stood by the well, peering down into the tranquil water.

He withdrew his gaze, looking up at the sky. “Is this my welcome gift for returning to the Qingming World?”

In the nearby Lotus Blossom small cave heaven, an old man continued to watch a droplet of water, observing it fall onto the uneven lotus leaves. The droplet appeared no larger than an ordinary raindrop, but many of the lotus leaves were as large as mountain peaks; even greater ones spanned entire states of kingdoms. Thus, the vein of a single lotus leaf could stretch for dozens or even hundreds of miles, making the path of a tiny droplet incredibly long before it eventually lands.

The old man was in no hurry.

Time flowed on, ages passed.

Yet, as the greatest rule existing between heaven and earth, even the vast river of time must take a detour when passing by the old man.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 507: Crossing the Bridge

In the city of Spring, the greenery was thick, yet throughout the northern border of the Stone Hair Kingdom, one could hardly find a single nobleman or young lord enjoying the spring outings. 

The three riders made their way north, stopping and starting, and before they knew it, summer had arrived. 

On this day, along a rugged mountain path near the Stone Hair Kingdom's border, the three riders halted to rest. Zeng Ye was busy preparing a meal, while Ma Duqi was tidying her appearance before a small green-painted bronze mirror, humming a cheerful tune. She was in high spirits, having bargained down to less than two taels of silver for the mirror at a pawn shop, a rather rare celestial-grade spirit tool known as the Sunlight Moonlight Mirror. According to the old cultivator Gui Jiang, who was in charge of the celestial ferry, it could fetch at least forty or fifty snowflake coins (a form of currency).

Chen Ping’an sat nearby, reviewing the accounts. Most names on the list had been lightly marked with red ink, indicating wishes fulfilled. However, some lingering regrets of the otherworldly spirits had to be temporarily set aside. In fact, both Chen Ping’an and the spirits understood that these desires would likely become unfulfilled wishes, destined to remain unmet in this life, regardless of the realm—be it Yin or Yang. Some spirits, bound by their grudges, were consumed by indignation, nearly transforming into vengeful spirits, relying only on a few Heart Purification Talismans posted in the underworld to maintain their remaining sanity.

The thrifty Ma Duqi had never complained about Chen Ping’an repeatedly crafting Heart Purification Talismans, which consumed his spiritual energy and heavenly money, akin to an endless pit.

Along the way, they encountered numerous remnants of the Stone Hair Kingdom's broken troops, scattered throughout the woods and hills, now acting as roving bandits who sporadically plundered the rear supply lines of the Great Li. Among them were those who, out of a sense of righteous duty, had no choice but to turn their weapons against the local populace of the Stone Hair Kingdom. The harsh winter had brought three consecutive heavy snowfalls at the end of last year, compounded by the chaos of war, leaving the northern territories of the Stone Hair Kingdom in dire straits. Even though these troops, numbering no more than three to four hundred, only sought a meager amount of food, the scattered impoverished towns along the border were barely hanging on to their scant reserves, hoping to survive until the next harvest. Thus, conflicts were inevitable, escalating between those fighting to avoid starvation and those clinging to national duty.

Chen Ping’an and his companions found themselves caught in a confrontation that almost turned bloody. A young soldier clad in tattered armor nearly swung his sword at a gaunt old man. Chen Ping’an rushed in, seizing the Stone Hair Kingdom's standard cavalry saber, and with a stomp of his foot, sent dozens of the kingdom's broken troops tumbling. He tossed the saber back into the young soldier’s sheath, and the sheer force of the impact sent him staggering backward.

Afterward, Chen Ping’an said nothing, merely holding his horse in the street, as the famished soldiers silently withdrew from the county town. He and his two companions also slowly left. 

Behind them, the local populace began to vocally scorn the soldiers of their own kingdom, hurling insults about their inability to confront the Great Li barbarians while bullying their own people, suggesting they should die honorably in battle rather than return to harm their own. Some even proposed sending a warning to the nearby major county's Great Li cavalry, hoping to claim a bounty.

After the cavalry departed, the young soldier suddenly broke into tears. 

An old officer resembling a lieutenant halted his horse, tears streaming down his face, and the entire malnourished, battered cavalry came to a standstill, anxious and bewildered. 

Chen Ping’an instructed Ma Duqi and Zeng Ye to stay put while he rode ahead slowly. 

This cavalry unit, once boasting over two thousand elite riders during its heyday, now dwindled to less than eighty, each one appearing as though they were facing a great enemy. 

Chen Ping’an tossed a heavy bag to the old officer, speaking in increasingly fluent Stone Hair Kingdom dialect, “Disperse. Remove your armor and vests, use this money as travel and resettlement expenses.”

The old officer caught the bag, opened it to reveal gold ingots, and looked up in confusion. 

Chen Ping’an continued, “If you don’t want to give up like this, you can choose a few clever brothers to pretend to be merchants and buy food in the stable counties, trying to avoid the Great Li spies and scouts. Buy small amounts each time, or it might raise the local officials' suspicions. After all, I believe you can’t tell who your own people are anymore.”

The old officer asked, “Is that all? Nothing else to gain?” 

Chen Ping’an nodded, “You have no other options. Since you’re already in the worst situation, why not give it a try? Besides, if I wanted to take credit for your heads to the officials who have already surrendered to the Great Li, it wouldn’t be this complicated. You, as a pure martial artist of the fourth realm, should understand this clearly.” 

The old officer hesitated, wanting to say something but held back. 

Chen Ping’an waved his hand, “This is all I can do. I’m not some benevolent benefactor, so don’t treat me like a fool.” 

Reluctantly, the old officer abandoned that less-than-noble thought, gratefully accepted the life-saving bag of gold, and clasped his hands in thanks to the thin man in the azure cotton robe, “Your generosity is commendable!” 

Chen Ping’an returned the gesture and left. As for the decision made by the Stone Hair Kingdom cavalry, it was not something he would follow to the end, unlike the dog meat shop incident back in the state city. 

The old officer felt a pang of regret, realizing he hadn’t even asked for Chen Ping’an’s name. 

When Ma Duqi saw Chen Ping’an returning on horseback, she teased, “You claim you’re not a benevolent benefactor, but is that really true?” 

Chen Ping’an laughed, “Seeing through things without speaking of them is an excellent habit in dealing with the world.” 

Just as Ma Duqi was about to poke fun at him again, Chen Ping’an had already galloped away, leaving her and Zeng Ye to hastily follow. 

The hooves of the three horses gently pressed against the spring-blooming earth. 

At this moment, Ma Duqi put down her bronze mirror and turned to look at Chen Ping’an, who had closed the account book, asking, “Mr. Chen, will we be able to return to the Script Lake before autumn?” 

Chen Ping’an nodded, “We should be able to.” 

Ma Duqi stretched lazily and accidentally bumped into the large bamboo box behind her, quickly reaching out to steady it. Inside, it was filled to the brim with treasures she had acquired at low prices from the recent three cities. Even though they were wrapped in silk and cushioned with cotton, she still worried about damaging those particularly delicate items. According to the old ghostly merchant living in the imitation Liuli Pavilion, these treasures were favored by wealthy families, and during times of chaos, they were worth far less than real gold and silver. However, once peace returned, even a small bird feeder among them could fetch two to three hundred taels of silver, and if a wealthy collector took a liking to it, the price could easily double.

These items could also be placed in Chen Ping’an’s “items at hand,” but Ma Duqi enjoyed opening the box to rummage through them whenever they stopped, much like her beloved little bronze mirror, indulging her curiosity at her own expense.

Zeng Ye had now truly become a fourth-realm cultivator, while Ma Duqi, with her better comprehension and aptitude, had risen to the fifth realm of the otherworldly spirits. 

Yet, in terms of true cultivation foundation, Zeng Ye was still superior—this was the importance of innate potential. 

One was in no rush, while the other was impatient; now Zeng Ye and Ma Duqi were getting along increasingly well, building a certain camaraderie. 

While eating, Chen Ping’an maintained his habit of chewing slowly, and Zeng Ye, squatting beside him, asked between bites, “Mr. Chen, how’s my boxing stance coming along?” 

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Sparse and scattered.” 

Zeng Ye sighed, originally believing that his six-step boxing stance would be second nature, but now he felt otherwise. 

Ma Duqi added fuel to the fire, “You’re just not cut out for martial arts. Even I can see it clearly; your boxing form is empty and loose, nowhere near proficient. Zeng Ye, do you still think you’re doing well?” 

Chen Ping’an reassured Zeng Ye, “Martial arts isn’t your main focus. A little training for health is enough to help strengthen your body. Otherwise, if you accidentally cultivate pure spiritual energy and it collides with your vital energy, it could be detrimental.” 

Zeng Ye mumbled, “Either I can’t learn anything, or I’m slow at it. Mr. Chen, aren’t you in a hurry?” 

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “If being in a rush were effective, I’d be impatient with you too.” 

Ma Duqi was holding back a laugh, ready to speak again. 

Chen Ping’an raised his hand, “Enough! Don’t keep teasing Zeng Ye about his training. Also, regarding Zeng Ye’s boxing form, it’s a miracle you can even recognize its flaws; it was just a casual comment from a senior, borrowed for your use, right?” 

Ma Duqi smiled, her eyes turning into crescent moons, remaining silent, implicitly agreeing. 

The three continued along the border of the Stone Hair Kingdom. 

Upon reaching a sect called Hawkfall Mountain in the northern border, with its lush green hills and beautiful scenery, Zeng Ye and Ma Duqi felt refreshed, unable to resist taking a few deep breaths of the abundant spiritual energy. 

In many areas with thin spiritual energy, the common folk might never meet a cultivator in their lifetime. This was why merchants bustled about seeking profits, and cultivators would instinctively avoid those places devoid of spiritual energy. After all, cultivation required patience, especially for cultivators of the lower five realms and those beneath the celestial immortals, wasting precious time in areas with no spiritual energy was a sheer extravagance. 

Previously, the ongoing wars had affected the mountains of the Stone Hair Kingdom, and later, many small peaks had gathered around Hawkfall Mountain, which had become the leading peak. Hawkfall Mountain, being expansive and historically a solitary sect, had fewer disciples and thus, many of its peaks were rented out to the lower-tier cultivator sects seeking refuge. 

In just two years, Hawkfall Mountain had gained a respectable reputation. 

It was said that many celestial shops had opened here, which was precisely why Chen Ping’an had come. Since they passed by, he decided to let Zeng Ye and Ma Duqi try to sell a dozen miscellaneous spirit tools they had picked up at low prices, with all the proceeds going to them. As for how they would “split the spoils” afterward, Chen Ping’an was unconcerned, leaving it for Zeng Ye and Ma Duqi to negotiate. He surmised that Zeng Ye would likely take a considerable loss, given Ma Duqi’s shrewdness—three Zeng Yes wouldn’t stand a chance against her.

Chen Ping’an thought to himself that if he ever opened a shop, Ma Duqi would make a suitable assistant.

Upon reaching the outskirts of Hawkfall Mountain, Chen Ping’an noticed a gathering of refugees. A bustling market was taking shape, filled with voices, and many areas were still under construction with great enthusiasm. Among them were not only strong young men but also women and children who could make it to Hawkfall Mountain. What surprised Chen Ping’an the most was that a martial temple of the Stone Hair Kingdom had already been completed. Though rudimentary, it adhered to the required court rituals without missing a detail. Additionally, some cultivators were busy crafting protective mountain formations, which likely represented the early stages of a celestial passageway or a mountain sect.

Two cultivators noticed the three unfamiliar faces of Chen Ping’an and his companions, their expressions wary. They subtly contacted each other, gathering in groups to intimidate the outsiders. 

Chen Ping’an no longer wore the jade talisman from Qingxia Island, and he had no qualms about it. He approached one of the cultivators to inquire about the way to the ancestral hall of Hawkfall Mountain. 

One of the cultivators, an elder in the cave dwelling realm, pointed the way. Only after Chen Ping’an and his companions left the market did they breathe a sigh of relief and return to their work on the mountain water formation.

They were merely a low-tier sect, and even after moving to Hawkfall Mountain, they could not gather much heavenly money when compared to other wealthier celestial residences. They could only be relegated to the eastern gate of Hawkfall Mountain, serving as its guardians. If trouble arose, such as the Great Li cavalry taking a disliking to Hawkfall Mountain, they would be the first to suffer the consequences, forced to stand firm against disasters for the mountain.

The establishment, rise, and inheritance of any mountain sect inevitably involved hardship, humiliation, and peril. 

However, the elder cultivator, one of the sect’s “ancestors,” stood on a high platform, his gaze lingering on a refugee child helping their parents wipe their sweat. The elder smiled knowingly—this child was a good seed. The ancestral hall of Hawkfall Mountain had planned to offer a small sum of money and a mountain plot spanning ten miles to change the child’s household registration. Yet, the elder rejected Hawkfall Mountain’s goodwill, intending to personally accept the child as his direct disciple. Who knows, in a hundred or sixty years, he might cultivate a cave dwelling realm cultivator from this child, perhaps even achieving the historical peak of the sect, which was not an unrealistic aspiration. The elder felt immense satisfaction at this notion. 

While his fellow disciples initially argued fiercely over the proposal, they eventually united in their determination. Even the stingiest younger disciple resolved that when the child came to pay respects as a disciple, he would gift the child a long-held spirit tool as a token. 

After leaving the market, Chen Ping’an suddenly turned back to glance at the gathering, then asked, “Did you see anything?” 

Zeng Ye and Ma Duqi felt confused. 

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “Nothing much. Perhaps I was seeing things.” 

Ma Duqi teased, “Mr. Chen, it’s not polite to leave half a sentence hanging.” 

Chen Ping’an laughed, “When you’re able to stand on your own in the future, you’ll understand that leaving half a sentence is a profound skill worth studying.” 

Ma Duqi clicked her tongue, “Mr. Chen, your self-praise is getting more and more refined.” 

Chen Ping’an turned in his saddle and clasped his hands in mock humility, “You flatter me, you flatter me.” 

Ma Duqi smirked, “Mr. Chen, if you keep this up, you truly will become the Mr. Chen in my heart!” 

Zeng Ye shook his head, “Where? Where?” 

It was evident that this young man was still leaning more toward Chen Ping’an. 

Then, Ma Duqi playfully swung her sleeve, landing a slap on his face, which stung. 

Zeng Ye scolded, “A gentleman speaks but does not act.” 

Now it was Ma Duqi’s turn to shake her head, “Only a petty person and a woman are hard to manage. Haven’t you learned this simple principle?” 

Chen Ping’an smiled wryly, “That saying is not meant to be understood this way. But if you’re willing to belittle yourself, I see no problem with it.” 

Laughing and joking, the three rode on to the true gate of Hawkfall Mountain. 

Compared to the two celestial peaks they had passed, this place possessed a solemn grandeur, a hidden realm, with more abundant spiritual energy than Huangli Mountain. 

At the foot of the mountain lay a tranquil little town, or rather, a larger village, with structures indicating a population of over a thousand. 

The so-called mountain grandeur, without the human touch, would eventually become an empty abode, a stream without a source. 

Yet, many cultivators who had yet to reach the peak were either too lazy or too disdainful to think this way. 

To reach the village at the foot of the mountain and then ascend, they needed to cross a river—not via an arch bridge, but along a slender, quiet bridge resting peacefully over the water. On its back, a villager was leading an ox, likely heading to the nearby fields to work, with a young boy riding a bamboo horse behind them, calling “Giddy up!” as if he were riding a real horse. 

Chen Ping’an was the first to stop and lead his horse aside, allowing the villagers and the water buffalo to pass. 

After the villagers and the buffalo crossed the bridge, they clearly had seen much of the world, paying little heed to the three outsiders. However, the boy on the bamboo horse was very curious about the real horses, and Chen Ping’an smiled at him. The child shyly grinned back and followed his father and the buffalo down the road. 

Zeng Ye found it amusing. 

On the misty Hawkfall Mountain, sword lights and rainbow lights often pierced the sky. 

However, the child seemed indifferent to such things, instead more intrigued by the horses beside them, frequently glancing back. 

Chen Ping’an took the lead across the low stone bridge over the river. 

Halfway across, he noticed other villagers quietly waiting to cross to the opposite bank. 

After stepping off the bridge, Chen Ping’an nodded in thanks to them, and the villagers smiled and nodded back. 

Zeng Ye appeared deep in thought. 

Ma Duqi felt the same. 

At that moment, Chen Ping’an suddenly turned his head to look at the sky. 

The small sword hilt in his sleeve and the jade talisman from Qingxia Island both radiated warmth simultaneously. 

Regarding this matter, Liu Zhimou had not concealed it; he could use them to track Chen Ping’an’s whereabouts. 

Chen Ping’an had no objections to this. 

A bolt of white light, a cultivator riding the winds, shot from beyond Hawkfall Mountain, crashing to the ground. 

It was a flustered old cultivator from Qingxia Island, Zhang Ye, who managed the secret treasury and fishing docks. 

This secret journey north had nearly depleted Zhang Ye's spiritual energy reserves from several of his vital meridians. This reckless act was detrimental to his foundational Dao, akin to sending a horse on an urgent message over eight hundred miles, which inevitably harmed the steed, even leading to the death of several mounts in succession. 

Zeng Ye was initially filled with joy; after all, Zhang Ye was the one who had personally pulled him out of that inferno on Maoyue Island. However, when the young man saw Zhang Ye's expression, he immediately fell silent. 

Chen Ping’an quickly steadied the swaying Zhang Ye, gently asking, “Has something happened at Script Lake?” 

Zhang Ye grimaced, “The sky has changed!” 

Chen Ping’an sighed. He had anticipated such a situation, although it wasn’t the worst-case scenario. Chen Ping’an had not taken many measures, as there was little he could effectively do. 

After all, human strength has limits. 

It was simple: either the Great Li’s commander Su Gaoshan had taken action, or the person behind Liu Laocheng of Gongliu Island had begun to intervene. 

Or perhaps both sides were colluding. 

Tao Yuanyi from Grain Island had turned against them, seeking self-preservation and betraying the alliance. Liu Zhimou, unwilling to part with Qingxia Island’s foundation, had been ensnared and caught in peril; it was all quite normal. 

But for Chen Ping’an at this moment, it was definitely not good news. 

The trajectory of the situation at Script Lake, which he had carefully crafted, might have already been casually overturned by later players. 

Zhang Ye knelt down with a thud, “I implore Mr. Chen to save the island master!” 

Chen Ping’an shook his head, directly asking, “Has Gu Can and his mother already been hidden away by Elder Zhang?” 

Zhang Ye, still kneeling, looked up, “It was sudden. Qingxia Island could not have done such a thing; even if we could, I would not act this way, as I know it would only backfire. The only one who can save the island master is Mr. Chen.” 

Chen Ping’an helped Zhang Ye to his feet, slowly saying, “Elder Zhang, please stand and speak. I’ll listen for now, but the possibility of saving Liu Zhimou is nearly nonexistent. I believe Elder Zhang is already aware of this on your way here. The reason for this trip is merely to do our part and leave the rest to fate.” 

Zhang Ye nodded slightly, bitterly smiling, his eyes reflecting some gratitude. 

Chen Ping’an was feeling a headache. 

In front of Zhang Ye, certain things, much like the earlier joke with Ma Duqi, were only half-said—seeing through them without speaking them out loud. 

Zhang Ye was indeed doing his best, but it was highly likely that he fully understood that his movements had already caught the attention of some observant individuals, perhaps overlooking them from somewhere in Hawkfall Mountain. 

Thus, Chen Ping’an refrained from pushing him further into despair. 

In truth, he had already done enough. 

Chen Ping’an said, “Let’s talk while we walk.” 

Zhang Ye steadied his thoughts, his first sentence sending ripples of shock through Zeng Ye and Ma Duqi, “Our island master was defeated by an unidentified cultivator and has been severely injured, imprisoned in the water prison of Gongliu Island. Furthermore, the Great Li cavalry commander Su Gaoshan has personally arrived at Yunlou City by Script Lake, threatening to annihilate all the rogue cultivators in Script Lake within ten days.” 

Chen Ping’an’s first thought was that the formidable cultivator capable of overpowering Liu Zhimou must be the wandering Mo family rogue Xu Ruo or the sage Ruan Qiong.

 ### Chapter 508: Journey South Alone (Part 1)

Along the gently flowing emerald river, Zhang Ye and Chen Ping'an walked side by side, leading a horse as they strolled through this idyllic paradise. Perhaps it was the serene and picturesque scenery that calmed the seasoned old cultivator, Zhang Ye, or perhaps it was the presence of Chen Ping'an, someone who felt like family. Having weathered countless storms, Zhang Ye gradually found peace within himself and began to recount the recent upheaval at Shujian Lake to Chen Ping'an.

It turned out that everyone had underestimated Su Gaoshan's ambition. This prominent general of the Great Li Iron Cavalry, who had long set his sights on the Zhu Ying Dynasty, had effortlessly captured the capital of the Shihau Kingdom. Afterward, he turned his horse around, leading his cavalry into another vassal state of Zhu Ying. Despite the fierce battles, he still had the "leisure" to personally visit the shores of Shujian Lake, making his presence known and declaring his intent to sweep through it. It was brutally simple: those who complied would thrive, while those who resisted would perish. The so-called compliance and resistance were laid bare—those wild cultivators at Shujian Lake willing to surrender everything, including their sect's assets, could leave with their lives. In contrast, those willing to give up half their fortunes and become the lowest-ranking cultivators in the Great Li army to fight against the Zhu Ying Dynasty could temporarily remain at Shujian Lake. However, afterward, decisions regarding the ownership of mountains and the relocation of their sects and ancestral halls would still be subject to the orders of the Great Li Iron Cavalry.

On another front, during late spring this year, a group of secretive foreign cultivators had emerged on Gongliu Island, becoming honored guests. With Su Gaoshan's public appearance, he brazenly proclaimed his intentions to the tens of thousands of wild cultivators at Shujian Lake. Just last night, under the personal leadership of Liu Laocheng, they unexpectedly stormed Qingxia Island. One elder cultivator, after Liu Laocheng broke through the island’s array, unleashed powerful magic—undoubtedly a Fifth Realm cultivator. With a single strike, he nearly destroyed the entire Hengbo Mansion. Subsequently, this cultivator, having laid in wait for Liu Zhimo, managed to capture him and escort him to Gongliu Island. Sensing the danger, Zhang Ye did not rush to his death but instead escaped through a hidden waterway beneath Qingxia Island, hastily making his way to the Shihau Kingdom, where he used a jade token for worship to find Chen Ping'an.

After listening to Zhang Ye's account in silence, Chen Ping'an finally asked, "What is Liu Laocheng's attitude?"

Zhang Ye shook his head. "After the events at Shujian Lake, I learned that ever since the cultivators of the Earth Immortal realm arrived at Gongliu Island, Liu Laocheng had not spoken a single word nor seen a local cultivator from Shujian Lake."

Zhang Ye sighed, "Although I deeply despise Liu Laocheng, I must admit that he possesses the cunning expected of a Fifth Realm wild cultivator."

Chen Ping'an remarked, "The current state of Shujian Lake must have many wild cultivators cursing Liu Laocheng as a traitor and a lapdog of the Great Li."

Zhang Ye's smile was bitter. "With over a thousand islands and tens of thousands of wild cultivators, everyone is busy looking out for themselves, nearly scared out of their wits. I bet just mentioning Liu Laocheng or Su Gaoshan sends shivers down people's spines."

He gently shook his head. "The last remnants of pride and backbone in Shujian Lake are completely gone. That earlier perilous collaboration to slay foreign Nascent Soul cultivators and Golden Core sword cultivators will no longer even be talked about over drinks. Liu Laocheng, that old thief! I truly cannot imagine what kind of benefits would lead him to betray all of Shujian Lake like this! The receptionist from Zhu Xian Mansion, Hong Su, was someone I spent nearly ten years searching for, tasked with finding the reincarnation of the previous female ruler of the Jianghu. I brought her back to Qingxia Island, hence I know that Liu Laocheng is not as indifferent to Shujian Lake as the rumors suggest."

Zhang Ye's expression was grim as he paused by the riverbank, cupping water in his hands to wash his face, his gaze vacant. 

The current situation weighed more heavily on Zhang Ye than his early days fighting alongside Liu Zhimo at Shujian Lake, when an Earth Immortal had once plunged an island to the bottom of the lake. Time had dulled his spirit. 

Especially since Zhang Ye had only a limited lifespan left, he could consider sacrificing himself, but would others be willing? With just a flick of a finger, Liu Laocheng could obliterate him, a cultivator of the Dragon Gate realm in Shujian Lake, into nothingness.

As Chen Ping'an held the reins of the horse, his sword and knife hanging at his waist, he said calmly, "Someone like Liu Laocheng, if he truly decides to return to Shujian Lake, would not do so for a mere ruler of the Jianghu. When he suppressed Gu Can and that descendant of the true dragon on Qingxia Island, it was merely a ruse. In reality, without Liu Zhimo, all of you at Shujian Lake would be left waiting to die, at the mercy of others. Because apart from Liu Zhimo, few understood the approaching storm from Baoping Continent, still thinking Shujian Lake could remain uninvolved, perhaps even believing the chaos outside would benefit them. Just like this current war in the Shihau Kingdom, many wild cultivators from Shujian Lake must have seized the opportunity to infiltrate, and I believe quite a few have fattened their pockets, only to realize that after earning a quick fortune, they’re about to be wiped clean of their gains; all those years of hard work, they won’t even know for whom they labored."

Still squatting by the riverbank, Zhang Ye helplessly replied, "We can't fully blame Shujian Lake for being blind. To put it bluntly, aside from our Qingxia Island and the opposing factions on Qingzhuang and Tianmu Islands, trying to cozy up to the Great Li Iron Cavalry depends on whether they’re willing to stretch out a leg. It also depends on whether one can even make it through the temple doors carrying a pig's head."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Indeed."

Zhang Ye stood up and exhaled deeply. "But if they were truly smart and daring enough to take a gamble, they would have reached out to the Great Li Iron Cavalry in the Shihau Kingdom earlier and offered their allegiance to make a good impression on a certain general. Once they were registered with the spies from the Great Li's Green Wave Pavilion, they would be in a position to reap great rewards when power was redistributed in Shujian Lake. That would be the real deal—a guaranteed profit. Our Qingxia Island has actually done well, but we lost because we couldn’t connect with Su Gaoshan and were stuck at Li Su Island with Tan Yuanyi. With Liu Laocheng's interference, our efforts were ruined."

Chen Ping'an frowned in thought, pausing before asking, "Elder Zhang, do you know if any major sects in Baoping Continent have considered relocating their sect headquarters in the past decade? Even if it's just a hint or rumor, have you heard anything?"

Zhang Ye shook his head despondently. "None. For instance, the leader of the Shengaos sect, Elder Qi, just ascended to the Heavenly Monarch realm, solid as a mountain. The Shengaos sect is a group of Daoist immortals dedicated to purity, and there’s been no sign of expansion. I heard the island master mention that the Shengaos sect had even recalled a group of roster Taoists, which is quite unusual. The island master speculated that perhaps the Shengaos sect discovered a new cave heaven and needed to send people in. Moreover, Zhenwu Mountain, Fengxue Temple, the Jiang family of Yunlin, and Old Dragon City seem to lack such signs."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Understood."

Zhang Ye's tension eased suddenly, fatigue washing over him, making him look haggard. 

But upon seeing Chen Ping'an's face beside him, he smiled. If Mr. Chen wasn’t complaining, how could he act like a spoiled young lady after living for hundreds of years? 

Zhang Ye then recounted his final conversation with Liu Zhimo at Hengbo Mansion, not to defend Liu Zhimo but to speak the truth as it was. 

The old ones of Shujian Lake had all departed, and the newcomers were increasingly arrogant. The earliest among them, Zhang Ye, who had legitimate roots as a roster immortal, could no longer find anyone to converse with. Unexpectedly, at the end of it all, he encountered someone like himself, a "cultivator" struggling in vain. Once the conversation started, he found himself speaking more than he intended. Observing the young man’s demeanor, he felt reassured when he noticed Chen Ping'an was not impatient. 

Chen Ping'an listened patiently.

When Zhang Ye reached a point of silence, Chen Ping'an gently reminded him, "Elder Zhang, it's best not to return to Shujian Lake. It would be futile; it’s better to stay farther away and observe the changes."

Zhang Ye shook his head, sighing, "Where else can I go? Qingxia Island is my home. If this incident hadn’t occurred, I wouldn’t mind finding a summer retreat nearby Shujian Lake to quietly spend my remaining days."

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment. "Elder Zhang, may I ask something off-topic? In the eyes of the older cultivators in your Dragon Gate realm, has Liu Zhimo ever mentioned whether one can sense the changes in circumstances in a certain time and place, or perceive some... omen?"

Zhang Ye shook his head. "The island master has never discussed this. At least, I’ve never had such ability. Involving the flow of fate in a place is the domain of the mountain and water deities, and I’m sure even Earth Immortals cannot see it clearly. As for the island master, who is just a step away from reaching the Fifth Realm, it’s hard to say whether he can do so. After all, even gods can only observe the mountains and rivers; they do not deal with the ethereal matters of fate."

Chen Ping'an remained indecisive, his words stuck on the tip of his tongue.

Suddenly, Zhang Ye burst into laughter. "What’s the matter, Mr. Chen? Is it so hard to be a good person? Clearly, you’re considering others, yet you’re more cautious than when it comes to your own affairs. Mr. Chen, there’s something I haven’t said before because we weren’t close enough, but now, since we’re not really friends yet, and tomorrow is uncertain for me, I want to speak frankly with you."

Chen Ping'an smiled. "Elder Zhang, feel free to speak your mind."

Zhang Ye looked at the young man before him, pausing for a long moment before finally saying, "Suddenly, I have no words left. What should I do?"

Chen Ping'an felt helpless, taking out his sword-holding gourd to sip some wine for refreshment. 

Even just hearing about the upheaval at Qingxia Island was mentally exhausting, pulling on every thread of thought. All the plans that followed were even more taxing. 

Chen Ping'an said, "On the easternmost part of Hehuo Mountain, there’s a small hill that just relocated. I noticed some strange phenomena there. If Elder Zhang trusts me, perhaps you could settle there for a while, just to clear your mind. The worst-case scenario now would be Liu Zhimo dying on Gongliu Island, a warning to others. At that point, whatever you decide to do, no one can stop you; I certainly won’t. It’s better than returning now, where you might be seen as an invisible provocation and thrown into Gongliu Island’s water prison. Perhaps you’re not afraid of that, and would even be pleased to see Liu Zhimo one last time. However, since Qingxia Island is currently only suffering the consequences of Hengbo Mansion and has not completely collapsed, this means that should an opportunity arise later, someone from Qingxia Island will need to step up. I can’t, nor do I wish to, but you, Elder Zhang, being the most trusted elder of Liu Zhimo from Qingxia Island, even if your cultivation isn’t high, could still rally the crowd."

Zhang Ye contemplated this carefully, nodding and self-deprecatingly saying, "I’m just a hard-working soul."

Suddenly, Zhang Ye used his heart lake voice to warn Chen Ping'an, "Be careful of Gongliu Island; someone is using me as bait. If that’s true, why go through the extra trouble? Why not simply use Gu Can and the Spring Courtyard as bait? I just can’t understand it; there must be a reason for such convoluted tactics. Of course, Mr. Chen should have thought of this; I’m merely seeking peace of mind while burdening you. The moment I left Qingxia Island, the weight of my responsibilities was already placed on your shoulders."

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly. "Some polite words are still necessary; at least it’ll make the other party feel better. This is a small lesson I just learned from a young man with the surname Guan."

Zhang Ye joked, "Mr. Chen is still learning lessons from others?"

Chen Ping'an pointed at Zhang Ye, then gestured at Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye, and finally traced a circle toward the village at the foot of Hehuo Mountain. "There are countless lessons outside; just mentioning a small matter, even the rural villagers know to yield while crossing bridges. Yet how many high-ranking cultivators are willing to practice such small lessons? Right?"

Zhang Ye’s pent-up frustration eased a bit. "Then I’ll go to the small hill that Mr. Chen mentioned, take a walk and see if I can find some wisdom?"

Chen Ping'an smiled. "Why not?"

Zhang Ye looked around, realizing he hadn’t taken a moment in years to appreciate the worldly scenery at the foot of the mountain.

Chen Ping'an said, "I won’t rush back to Shujian Lake for Liu Zhimo. I still have my own matters to attend to, and even if I return, I’ll only do what I can."

Zhang Ye nodded. "If I had heard this answer when we first met, I would have been anxious, but now, I have no spirit left and wouldn’t dare to force anything upon you. Mr. Chen, just follow your own thoughts and do as you see fit."

Chen Ping'an and Zhang Ye spoke almost in unison, "Polite words still need to be exchanged."

The two exchanged smiles. 

Zhang Ye straightened his clothes before departing, no longer flying with rainbow-like grace, but instead crossing a small bridge slowly as he left.

Chen Ping'an, along with Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye, led the horse along the blue stone path through the village. After climbing over the mountain, they passed through the gate of Hehuo Mountain, which did not seem to keep people at bay. It was merely a small archway, and there wasn’t even a gatekeeper. The Hehuo Mountain cultivators were few and far between; even though the patriarchal hall had more than one lineage, they were still countable. Excluding the worshippers and guest officials, there were likely fewer than twenty true Hehuo cultivators. However, there was a place on Hehuo Mountain similar to Tongyezhou's Hantian Street or Chishui City’s Monkey Cry Street, where practitioners, despite their ascetic paths, still needed money to pave their way, a truth that had persisted for millennia, preventing Hehuo Mountain from becoming too desolate.

Chen Ping'an looked back.

Zhang Ye’s figure had already disappeared from view. 

If one were to say that Zhang Ye did not feel disappointed for not getting the answers he sought and for Liu Zhimo being trapped, potentially facing death on Gongliu Island, would he not be extremely disappointed? 

Of course, he would be deeply so.

However, disappointment is one thing; how to proceed after disappointment is another, revealing one’s character and capabilities. 

Thus, Chen Ping'an held a profound respect for Zhang Ye, for those like Guan Yiran, and for that ghost general from the Shihau Kingdom, Su Xinzai of Huangli Mountain. 

We never know when we tread upon the arduous road of suffering if we will encounter even greater storms and snowfalls, or if we will meet one or two good people, like flickering lights in the dark. 

Chen Ping'an summoned a spirit who had been a practitioner from the Sea Observation realm in life, allowing Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye to keep watch, preventing them from wandering aimlessly on Hehuo Mountain's streets. Ma Duyi explored all sorts of shops, comparing prices, both selling and buying, having already arranged to divide the spoils with Zeng Ye. She would also help Zeng Ye strategize on which spirit tools to buy that would be most cost-effective at their current level, avoiding the temptation of only seeking high quality and status. Though Zeng Ye often found herself dazzled by choices, she would still heed Ma Duyi's advice. Thus, the two, one human and one spirit, had already formed a true friendship. 

Chen Ping'an observed this with a smile in his heart.

As they were in a celestial merchant's shop, many items having collected dust for decades or were recently acquired at bargain prices, belonged to the whimsical nature of celestial dealings. This was akin to the time he had purchased the lady's painting and the imitation yellow sword at Monkey Cry Street, where the old shopkeeper had thrown in three small items for free. At such moments, the old ghost would need to step in, as practitioners who had renounced the mundane world, even while engaging in commerce, might not accurately evaluate the worth of antiquities and treasures from secular dynasties. Thus, Chen Ping'an and his group had managed to score some unexpected bargains.

They returned fully laden.

Leaving Hehuo Mountain behind.

Chen Ping'an continued along the established route, traversing the border of the Shihau Kingdom, passing through various cities and fortifications, fulfilling the wishes of the spirits and ghosts, whether large or small.

During this time, he kept a close watch on the developments at Shujian Lake. However, similar to the low-cost old newspaper he had bought from the shopkeepers on Hehuo Mountain, most of the news about Shujian Lake was trivial gossip. 

In April, during the time of "Small Fullness," if one were in the hometown small town of Lihuzhou, one would need to be particularly mindful about water disputes in the fields, as it could affect the year’s harvest. 

As Chen Ping'an was preparing to return to Shujian Lake, he received a widely circulated celestial newspaper in the northern border of the Shihau Kingdom, reporting several significant events. 

Another major general of the Great Li Iron Cavalry, Cao Ping, had made bold military moves, daringly splitting his forces into three routes, leaving only the central army to stay in place, confronting the Zhu Ying Dynasty's border forces. The other two cavalry units had successively breached two vassal states of the Zhu Ying Dynasty—not to annex them, but to completely scatter the battlefield forces of the two vassal states, leaving many troops to continuously withdraw, relying on fortified cities to defend themselves. This allowed Cao Ping's cavalry even greater freedom.

Refugees from both nations were flooding into the borders of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, and the vassal states were sending envoys to Zhu Ying's capital, kneeling and begging for help, bleeding from their foreheads, desperately pleading for the Zhu Ying army to decisively strike and engage the Great Li barbarians outside the cities. As a result, the general stationed at the Zhu Ying border, facing Cao Ping, was heavily criticized, labeled as cowardly, and rumors of collusion with the Great Li spread throughout Zhu Ying's court. The Zhu Ying court was forced to divide into factions advocating for offense and defense, with confusion reigning in both civilian and military circles. The Zhu Ying emperor had been infuriated multiple times, directly ending court sessions in anger.

If this were merely a matter of human affairs... 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 509: Southbound Alone (Part 2)

Recently, as summer approached, a shocking event took place on the mountain. Wei Jin, a celestial being from the Wind and Snow Temple, sought out the great practitioner Xie Shi, who had been temporarily residing in the central region of the Bottle Gourd Continent for his cultivation. After their battle, Wei Jin left the Bottle Gourd Continent, solitary and on his sword, heading towards the Upside-Down Mountain.

The outcome of the battle on the mountaintop, witnessed by only a handful, remained a secret. However, since Xie Shi continued to stay on the Bottle Gourd Continent, it was clear that this Daoist celestial being, already facing widespread ire from the inhabitants of the continent, had not lost.

Even if Wei Jin failed to defeat Xie Shi with a single strike, the practitioners of the Bottle Gourd Continent held no grievances against the newly ascended terrestrial sword immortal. Instead, they felt a sense of pride for their fellow cultivator, especially the sword cultivators of the Bottle Gourd Continent, who were elated.

This was a monumental event that captured the attention of the entire continent.

Among these events, there was another noteworthy incident in the central region of the Bottle Gourd Continent. A young True Martial Mountain cultivator named Ma Kuxuan, not yet twenty and with only a few years of practice, had astonishingly killed two Golden Elixir sword cultivators in two fierce battles, allegedly while withholding his true abilities. The Zhu Ying Dynasty chose to remain silent on the matter, as both battles had been observed by protectors from True Martial Mountain and members of the royal family, ensuring that Ma Kuxuan acted within his rights, openly and honorably.

In no time, Ma Kuxuan’s name spread across the entire Bottle Gourd Continent.

After the Grain Full Festival, especially as the rainy season set in, the damp and sinister energies became a concern. Whether for cultivators or ordinary folks, it was crucial to nurture one's Yang energy to resist the encroaching dampness.

As Chen Ping’an traveled north with his two companions, they followed a route east of the capital of the Shihau Kingdom. On their journey south, they took a different path.

On a day of pouring rain, the three of them took shelter at a dilapidated pavilion. Suddenly, Chen Ping’an felt a tremor in his heart, and the wooden box in his sleeve became warm and shuddered.

A communication sword, one that should not have appeared, had arrived.

Liu Zhimou was already imprisoned in the water dungeon; it was impossible for him to wield his small sword to send a message to himself under the watchful eyes of Liu Laocheng and those strange cultivators.

Chen Ping’an even considered ignoring it. 

However, after weighing the pros and cons, he cautiously retrieved the unmistakably Liu Zhimou’s communication sword and disabled its restrictions.

The message contained only three sentences.

“Be careful on your return to Shujian Lake.”

“The reason for this reminder has nothing to do with you, Chen Ping’an, nor our predetermined deal; it’s purely because I cannot stand certain faces. To show my sincerity, I borrowed Liu Zhimou’s sword.”

“Do not respond to this message.”

After putting away the wooden box, Chen Ping’an fell into deep thought.

This was undoubtedly Liu Laocheng’s doing. But why he took such an approach deserved further scrutiny.

Liu Laocheng’s so-called “reminder” would not merely address the changing situation at Shujian Lake; Chen Ping’an was neither blind nor deaf and had already been informed by Zhang Ye. Given Liu Laocheng’s meticulous nature and ambitious spirit, it was unlikely he would waste words on such matters. Therefore, Liu Laocheng’s reminder was probably related to something more subtle, very likely concerning Chen Ping’an himself.

Standing at the edge of the leaky pavilion, he gazed into the gloomy rain curtain, realizing that a worse outcome awaited him.

Zhang Ye’s escape through the hidden passage of Qingxia Island might have been anticipated by certain behind-the-scenes figures.

But why hadn’t they directly attacked Gu Can and the Spring Court, instead opting for a more complicated method to force him to rush back to Shujian Lake? Killing him directly would have been much simpler.

With a sigh, Chen Ping’an murmured, “Is it another struggle for the Dao? If so, it must not be the sects from the Bottle Gourd Continent taking action—perhaps it’s the Tongye Sect, where Du Mao resides? Or Taiping Mountain? That’s unlikely. The first major sect to cross Tongye Island would be the Fuyi Sect, but I merely passed through with Lu Tai then, having no entanglements. The struggle for the Dao has distinctions and nuances; the one who could pursue me all the way to the Bottle Gourd Continent must be a practitioner at the Fifth Realm, so the likelihood of it being the Fuyi Sect is small.”

His brow furrowed, Chen Ping’an said, “But to say it’s that old observer with unmatched Dao skills doesn’t fit either, as he wouldn’t be so limited in his pursuits here.”

Suddenly, he turned to his companions, “Zeng Ye, Ma Duyi, you don’t need to accompany me back to Shujian Lake. Go directly to the border where the Shihau Kingdom meets the Meiyou Kingdom and wait for me there.”

Zeng Ye opened his mouth to speak but was pulled back by Ma Duyi.

Chen Ping’an turned back, continuing to gaze at the rain curtain.

After leaving the pavilion, he rode south alone.

He traded his heavy green cotton robe for a thin, fitted green shirt.

Chen Ping’an arrived without incident at the Green Tung City on the edge of Shujian Lake.

After all, Green Tung City was a minor power at the borders of Shujian Lake. The undercurrents, the shifting fortunes of Shujian Lake, and Su Gaoshan's shocking actions in Chishui City meant that for the local residents of Green Tung City—be they aimless cultivators who couldn’t seize an island to establish their sect or the common people who struggled to get by—many times, the bigger the event, the quieter it became. Amidst the tides of fate, what could they do if they did not recognize their destiny? Especially for those born and raised among mundane folks, with the world in such turmoil, even if they had some savings, where could they move? Would they dare?

Green Tung City had an abundance of delicious food.

Chen Ping’an casually found a bun shop and was pleasantly surprised to buy two buns. He loved to eat, so he bought two more; it had been a long time since he had felt nine-tenths full.

The shop had just opened, and the young proprietor was a boy who had just come of age. Business was going well.

As Chen Ping’an made his way from Green Tung City to Chishui City along the borders of Shujian Lake, he gathered more information. Compared to the war-torn Shihau Kingdom, the news here was evidently closer to the truth.

At the familiar ferry in Chishui City, after more than half a year, the ferry remained quietly docked at the shore.

Even though Liu Zhimou from Qingxia Island had completely lost power, his status as the top worshiper still held some weight.

Along the way, he left his horse at an inn, giving the innkeeper a sum of silver to take care of it.

As the summer heat intensified, the entire Shujian Lake felt like a giant steamer.

It was hard to imagine that when he left Shujian Lake, the area was still a snowy landscape, an ink-and-wash painting of mountains and waters.

Chen Ping’an rowed a boat back to Qingxia Island alone.

After docking and passing through the mountain gate, the old doorkeeper still wore a lackluster expression but greeted the returning accountant with a smile that had not faded.

It seemed that the disappearance of the island master Liu Zhimou, the ruins of the Hengbo Manor, and the Great Li's general's plans to take Shujian Lake had not disrupted the old man’s leisurely life.

After greeting the old doorkeeper and exchanging a few pleasantries, Chen Ping’an opened the door to his abode; nothing seemed amiss, just a layer of dust accumulated because he had instructed not to clean before leaving Qingxia Island.

First, he visited the ruins of the Hengbo Manor, which would likely never be rebuilt. Standing at the edge of the ruins, he remained silent for a moment before turning towards the still-grand Spring Court.

Now that Qingxia Island was leaderless, and with Zhang Ye having gone silent, Liu Zhimou’s eldest disciple Tian Hu Jun, a local Golden Elixir practitioner, had also entered seclusion during this turmoil. Coupled with Gu Can having lost that little mudfish, the senior worshipers like Yu Huai on the subordinate islands were now scheming in secret, trading plans with Liu Zhimou’s direct disciples and the worshipers on the subordinate islands.

It was believed that during this time, the Spring Court, seemingly flourishing without the oppressive presence of the Hengbo Manor and Liu Zhimou, was in fact experiencing considerable strain.

With the sky collapsing, who would be next now that Liu Zhimou had fallen?

The members of the Spring Court, no matter how oblivious they were to the grand scheme, would surely realize the gravity of their situation.

Gu Can’s mother was already waiting at the entrance with two beautiful young maidservants.

The Spring Court still had its intelligence network.

The woman walked briskly towards Chen Ping’an, whispering, “Ping’an, how have you gotten thinner?”

With a sigh in his heart, Chen Ping’an still smiled and replied, “I’ve been wandering around the Shihau Kingdom, often eating and sleeping outdoors. I’ve gotten used to it; it’s actually not bad. Where’s Gu Can?”

The woman laughed, “Since you left Qingxia Island, he likes to wander alone around the island. Right now, he’s probably off somewhere wild. You know how he is—he’s always been this way. I have to shout at mealtimes, or he won’t come. But now it’s even worse. Even if I shout loudly, if he’s wandered off far, he can’t hear me anymore. At first, I wasn’t used to it, you know.”

Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile, “Then I’ll wait for him here. Once we finish discussing matters, I’ll be leaving Shujian Lake soon.”

The woman looked disappointed, “Are you in such a hurry?”

Chen Ping’an replied with an “Mm.”

She then kept Chen Ping’an company, reminiscing about their hardships, discussing the trivial matters of the past in Niping Alley and Xinghua Alley. Chen Ping’an also brought up some recent happenings regarding Ma Kuxuan.

The woman expressed her astonishment, saying she never expected that the silly boy who had suffered so much back then would achieve so much now. It was a pity that the sharp-tongued Ma Granny couldn’t witness her grandson’s success; she was not fated to enjoy the rewards. At this point, the woman seemed to be touched by memories, turning her head to wipe the corners of her eyes with her scarf.

About half an hour later, Gu Can returned leisurely to the Spring Court.

Seeing his mother and Chen Ping’an waiting at the entrance, the tall Gu Can, who could easily make one forget his true age, still did not quicken his pace.

Upon reaching the entrance, Gu Can greeted his mother and then looked straight at Chen Ping’an, softly saying, “You’re back?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I’ve heard about the situation on Qingxia Island. There are some things we need to discuss.”

The woman, understanding the moment, took her leave.

Chen Ping’an led Gu Can towards the ruins of Hengbo Manor, saying slowly, “The more chaotic it is, the less hurried we should be. Rushing in haste leads to mistakes, and that is the least advisable.”

Gu Can nodded.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Do you know that Yuan Yuan from Huangli Island has already sided with Great Li?”

Gu Can nodded again, “I’ve heard. There’s no wall that doesn’t let the wind through. Since we last met, Lu Caisang hasn’t come once, but Han Jingling and Huang He made a special trip to Qingxia Island after Su Gaoshan’s appearance and Liu Zhimou’s incident. Huang He even wanted to peek into your room, but I turned him down. His face didn’t look too good at that time.”

Chen Ping’an glanced at Gu Can.

Gu Can smiled, “I know I’m not very clever, but I’m not completely foolish either.”

Chen Ping’an responded, “It’s better to be slightly improved than not at all. Every bit of wisdom counts.”

The two fell silent, walking together through the remnants of Hengbo Manor.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Do you want to leave Shujian Lake with me? You can return later, just as I am doing now.”

Gu Can countered, “But what about my mother?”

Chen Ping’an did not provide an answer.

He merely offered a choice.

Gu Can shook his head, “I know you’re doing this for me, but I won’t go. If I leave, I won’t feel at ease. Even if I stay here without any use, I can’t just leave like that. I already owe you enough; I can't let down the little mudfish or my mother. I won’t regret this, Chen Ping’an; go ahead and scold me if you want.”

Chen Ping’an did not insist nor scold Gu Can.

Gu Can found this puzzling.

Chen Ping’an, with his hands folded in his sleeves, looked at Gu Can, who wore a confused expression, and gently said, “Has Chen Ping’an ever scolded the little snot-nosed kid from Niping Alley?”

Gu Can laughed.

And cried a little too.

So that’s how it is; Chen Ping’an’s reasoning was that simple.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 510: Where My Heart Finds Peace (Part 1)**  

Chen Ping'an's journey to Qingxia Island was swift, both in arrival and departure.  

Whether Gu Can chose to leave or stay was inconsequential to the larger scheme of things. In truth, there were many events behind the scenes that Chen Ping'an could not change—be it the actions of Su Gaoshan from the Great Li, the upheaval at Shujian Lake, or the scheming of the cultivators from Gongliu Island. As long as Chen Ping'an remained unwilling to part from the central region of Baoping Continent, Gu Can's location mattered little. However, it would be best if Gu Can willingly chose to stay on Qingxia Island, guarding the Spring Court.  

Chen Ping'an took to his boat and set off.  

Upon landing in Lvtong City, he passed by the now-ruined Master Hall on Furong Mountain, where the fire dragon had once rampaged, its fury rivaling the tumult of the mud loach's upheaval. Those with a high enough cultivation level at Shujian Lake had mistakenly believed that this fire dragon was a formidable foe of Gu Can’s path, and if it made an appearance, a fierce conflict between water and fire would ensue. Little did they expect that the foreigner rumored to be a member of the Great Li's Zhan Clan would choose to withdraw instead.  

Nevertheless, the aftermath kept the spectators entertained. A mysterious woman draped in green and a peculiar young boy with a birthmark on his forehead banded together to slay a nine-level sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Rumor had it that not only did they reduce his body to mere sustenance, but they also captured his Nascent Soul, implying that these two “old cultivators” who bore the appearance of youthful boys and girls had held back considerably during the chase, instilling even greater fear in others.  

Defeating an Earth Immortal is worlds apart from slaying one.  

After disembarking, Chen Ping'an retrieved his horse from the inn and stopped by a shabby shop in an alley to purchase a few meat buns with thin skin and generous filling. After a hearty meal, he set off towards the southeastern border of Shihou Nation, which borders the Mei You Kingdom, specifically a pass known as Liuxia. This pass has some historical fame, with various tales surrounding it. Some say that the founding emperor of the Zhu Ying Dynasty once successfully retained a strategist of the Han Clan, who was credited with "half the merit" in this location. Others claim that the strongest Nascent Soul sword cultivator in the history of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, disheartened, sought enlightenment here but ultimately could not ascend to the fifth realm of sword immortals, leaving behind the inscription “Liuxia” on the cliff with his fierce sword intent before dying in regret. This has led sword cultivators in the central Baoping region and numerous wandering swordsmen to regard this small pass of a tributary nation as sacred ground, making pilgrimages to admire the inscription’s grandeur.  

Before autumn arrived, Chen Ping'an hastily reached Liuxia Pass and met up with his long-awaited companions, Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi.  

Upon seeing Chen Ping'an's familiar figure, both Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye visibly relaxed.  

Initially, they enjoyed a certain freedom without Chen Ping'an by their side. Zeng Ye carried a bamboo box containing the Underworld Yama Hall, which he could draw upon in emergencies to summon a few ghostly beings from Chen Ping'an's "appointed" caves, allowing them to traverse the Jianghu of Shihou Nation. As long as they didn’t attract too much attention, it would suffice. Thus, Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi spoke freely and without restraint. However, as they continued on their way, they began to feel uneasy. Even the sight of the Great Li scouts wandering about made them uneasy. That’s when they realized how different it was to have Chen Ping'an with them.  

With Chen Ping'an present, there were indeed rules to follow, but with one person and one ghost, at least they felt some assurance.  

This kind of feeling was something Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi had discussed privately but could not articulate; it just felt like it was more than just Chen Ping'an's high cultivation.  

At the scenic site of Liuxia Pass, they gazed upward at the large characters carved into the cliff face, and both noticed that Chen Ping'an seemed increasingly troubled after returning from a visit to Shujian Lake.  

Chen Ping'an noticed this too and, after some contemplation, withdrew his gaze, stating frankly, “Before coming here, I took two jade tokens, hoping to meet Su Gaoshan of the Great Li, but I was unable to.”  

Zeng Ye didn’t think much of it, merely feeling a bit disappointed for Chen Ping'an.  

However, Ma Duyi was well aware of the undercurrents of danger lurking beneath those words.  

Chen Ping'an tried to maintain a lighthearted tone as he chuckled, “Many things, if left untouched, will remain unanswered forever. Once a choice is made, there will be both good and bad outcomes, and right now, we are facing the bad. Not only did I not get to see Su Gaoshan, perhaps I didn’t raise any alarms, but I will certainly be on the mind of that Great Li general. So, we must be extra cautious moving forward. If any of you happen to spot the Great Li’s accompanying cultivators while traveling through Mei You Kingdom, just pretend you didn’t see them. Rest assured, we won’t be in any mortal danger.”  

Zeng Ye nodded but couldn’t shake the weight on his mind.  

Ma Duyi, on the other hand, was carefree and laughed, “As long as we aren’t chased by the Great Li cavalry like rabbits, I don’t mind if they want to watch. We’re not carrying a single copper coin to be worth robbing anyway.”  

Chen Ping'an sighed, “You two should balance each other out a bit.”  

Ma Duyi glared, “Don’t go pairing us up randomly, Chen Ping'an. I have no interest in Zeng Ye.”  

Zeng Ye laughed foolishly, although he didn’t dare to admit he felt the same about Ma Duyi.  

At the foot of the cliff, a sparse group of merchants from Shihou Nation and Mei You Kingdom, mostly young, hoped to return to their towns to boast about their travels. As for the older merchants and seasoned Jianghu figures, they had long since seen the inscription on the cliff countless times and had no interest in lingering.  

Just as Chen Ping'an and his two companions turned their horses around, a group of Jianghu swordsmen galloped in, dismounting to respectfully bow before the characters carved into the cliff.  

The elder among them passionately recounted the historical significance of the site to the younger merchants, praising the sword-wielders among them. The young men and women listened raptly, excitement reflected in their faces.  

They were likely from a Jianghu sect, having left their masters to experience the world.  

Chen Ping'an could tell the elder was a reasonably strong fifth-realm warrior, a respected figure in the relatively small territory of Mei You Kingdom. However, unless he encountered a significant opportunity, this old swordsman would likely never reach the sixth realm, as his vitality had diminished, leaving him with lingering ailments, causing his soul to waver, making the fifth realm's barrier even more unyielding. Thus, when he met younger warriors of the same realm, it was a case of "the fist fears the young."  

Encounters in Jianghu often passed by without interaction as the trio rode on.  

The elder turned to gaze at their retreating figures, noticing a slim girl with slightly elongated features, and asked, “Master, that one in the green shirt, bearing both sword and dagger, looks like one of our kind from Jianghu. Is he a hidden master?”  

The elder chuckled, “Not every one in a green shirt bearing a sword is a sword immortal.”  

They mounted their horses and continued their journey through the pass.  

While Mei You Kingdom remained relatively stable, Shihou Nation was in disarray. A clean official with longstanding ties to their sect had sent a secret letter stating that a powerful eunuch in Shihou Nation sought to eliminate him, risking the involvement of innocents. This honest loyal minister, renowned alongside the “Literary Talent and Imperial Historian,” expressed in his letter his willingness to remain in the capital to serve the nation in death, so the Great Li barbarians would know that Shihou Nation still had scholars unafraid of death. He hoped that his Jianghu friends could escort local families to Mei You Kingdom for refuge, allowing him to rest easy.  

After passing through Liuxia Pass, they would be on the territory of Shihou Nation.  

In the letter, the minister wrote a phrase that deeply resonated with the old warrior and his disciples, prompting them to venture into danger without hesitation.  

“The Han family has been generous for generations, with emperors valuing literary talents, nurturing scholars for two hundred years without neglect. We, as scholars, cannot disgrace the Han family.”  

The elder sat atop his horse, sighing internally as the Great Li cavalry pressed upon Mei You Kingdom. With such vast lands, why was it so difficult to secure a place for the common people, or to find peace for scholars?  

This old Jianghu figure, accustomed to the ebbs and flows of life, harbored an unutterable thought deep within: it would be better if the Great Li barbarians quickly conquered the Zhu Ying Dynasty. After the chaos, perhaps there might be an opportunity for a better world. Regardless of the outcome, it was certainly preferable to the several cavalry units of the Great Li, which were like knives cutting into the flesh of the Zhu Ying tributary states, mercilessly harming the innocent.  

Not to mention, the Great Li’s treatment of the other nations they trod upon was ruthless in battle, but if one were to shift their gaze northward, they would see countless refugees gradually returning to their homelands over the past few years, while the Great Li’s civil officials had managed to accomplish quite a bit on a personal level.  

But these thoughts, destined to be wrong the moment they were spoken, could only be drowned in the old wine the elder carried.  

Meanwhile, the three riders continued on.  

Their task remained to assist the ghostly beings in fulfilling their myriad wishes, while Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi were primarily responsible for managing the porridge shop and the pharmacy. However, with Mei You Kingdom remaining quite stable, there wasn’t much to do.  

In a world rife with chaos and uncertainty, the common people remained oblivious, anxious yet powerless.  

By a secluded stream in the wilderness, they stumbled upon an odd scene—a group of bandits, having turned to a life of crime, appeared troubled by a middle-aged Daoist lying on a giant stone in the water.  

The gaunt Daoist, hailing from the Zhu Ying Dynasty and now possessing the cultivation of a cave dwelling, believed that the world had descended into chaos and as a Daoist, he should descend the mountain to aid the common folk. Unfortunately, he encountered a skilled fortune teller who told him he was destined to die young, living a life of hunger and cold. The middle-aged Daoist became despondent and began to wait for death.  

This group of horse thieves from Shihou Nation, having just completed a profitable deal, stopped their horses by the stream and, seeing such a peculiar person wanting to die, almost struck him down. To their surprise, the Daoist was overjoyed and begged them to end his life quickly. This left the young bandit feeling conflicted, paralyzed by the thought of killing someone who seemed so content with their fate. The Daoist, wishing for death, ended up lecturing the group of seasoned thieves, sharing insights on karma and retribution. After all, he was seen as a fifth-realm immortal in the eyes of the local commoners, and his wisdom and eloquence left the bandits feeling more frightened than threatening.  

And thus, Chen Ping'an happened upon this scene.  

The bandits, having lost their desire to kill and loot, no longer saw the three riders as easy prey and deliberately ignored them.  

Chen Ping'an, however, remained unfazed, stopping to wash his horse’s nose, starting a fire, and preparing a meal—simply going about his business.  

The Daoist, seeing that the bandits weren’t killing him, figured that with his cave-dwelling physique, he wouldn’t die anytime soon, so he continued to lie on the stone, waiting for death. If the bandits had intentions of robbing the three riders, the Daoist would naturally have intervened, seeing it as a chance to accumulate a bit of merit before his demise, hoping for a better reincarnation in his next life.  

Chen Ping'an crouched by the stream with his rice bowl as the others prepared to eat.  

A hot-tempered young bandit caught Chen Ping'an’s gaze and glared at him, exclaiming, “What are you staring at? Haven’t you ever seen a hero having a meal?!”  

One of the bandit leaders, with good intentions, approached the stone where the middle-aged Daoist lay and offered him a bowl of rice, suggesting that waiting to die wasn’t a way to live. He advised the Daoist to eat well and, if a thunderstorm came, to take shelter under a tree or on a mountaintop and see if he might get struck by lightning. That way, he could die cleanly and without complications. The Daoist, upon hearing this, found it somewhat reasonable and pondered whether to buy a heavy iron chain from the market, although he still refused the bowl of rice, claiming he wasn’t hungry. Instead, he began to ramble on about why the bandits should use their goodwill to become better people, suggesting they quit being thieves and instead become bodyguards—surely a better path in these chaotic times.  

The bandit leader felt somewhat swayed, holding the bowl of rice as he returned to discuss it with his brothers.  

Chen Ping'an found the situation amusing.  

Having finished his rice, he pointed his toes and floated over to the giant stone, his green shirt fluttering as he landed gracefully beside the middle-aged Daoist.  

The young bandit nearly spat out his mouthful of rice, prompting the bandit leader to smack him on the head, “What are you looking at? Haven’t you ever seen a hero from Jianghu before?!”  

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged on the giant stone and smiled, “Daoist, why do you seek death?”  

The middle-aged Daoist, actually a kind-hearted person, closed his eyes and replied softly, “It is destined for me to die; the Dao is beyond my reach. If I do not die, what purpose do I serve?”  

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Do you know of the ‘Classic of Changes,’ an ancient text revered by Confucians, Buddhists, and Daoists alike? It contains the line: ‘The Great Way has fifty, Heaven’s transformation is forty-nine, and humanity escapes one.’”  

The middle-aged Daoist nodded, “The number of transformations in the Great Way is fifty; of those, forty-nine are applied. We say that Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, and two give birth to all things.”  

Chen Ping'an continued, “When a demonic obstacle arises, it is particularly challenging for a cultivator to persevere. Even if one possesses a million strong soldiers, it is difficult to dispel the enemy within one’s heart.”  

The middle-aged Daoist sat up with a sigh, “I understand the reasoning, but I am merely a mediocre cave dweller. How can I dare to hope for the Great Way? I am truly fearful and have pondered endlessly, yet I cannot break through the barriers in my heart, so I can only place my hope in my next life.”  

Chen Ping'an glanced at the bandits nearby and nodded, “Indeed, it is easy to defeat the thieves in the mountains but difficult to conquer the thieves in one’s heart. They are one and the same.”  

The middle-aged Daoist forced a smile, “I appreciate your goodwill.”  

A gaunt middle-aged Daoist and a weary young man met by chance amidst the mountains and waters.  

Their conversation was brief, and they parted ways without further exchange of words.  

The bandits sighed in relief, especially the young one, who felt as though he had just danced on the edge of death.  

Zeng Ye couldn't comprehend the middle-aged Daoist's mindset and quietly asked as they departed, “Mr. Chen, are there truly people willing to wait for death in this world?”  

Chen Ping'an nodded, “The paths of cultivation are filled with all kinds of oddities. According to Buddhist teachings, one must first attain self-liberation before there is hope for awakening; otherwise, no matter how high the monk’s virtue, a single blow from him will not lead to enlightenment but merely result in a headache. Have you heard of a Buddhist parable? One master said, ‘The heart is like a bright mirror, always diligently polishing it, lest it gather dust.’ Another said, ‘Originally, there is nothing; where can dust be attracted?’ Do you think there is a difference in these two verses?”  

Zeng Ye shook his head, “I don’t understand this.”  

Ma Duyi laughed, “Of course, the latter is higher.”  

Chen Ping'an gently sighed, “The intention behind Buddhism may suggest that the latter is indeed superior. However, the former is a ferry that all the infatuated men of the world can board. To cross by oneself, one must put down the bamboo pole in their hand, rise, and step onto the shore. Only then can one truly say they have understood the latter. Gradual enlightenment is the basis of sudden enlightenment, and there is a sequence to this. In life, the heart’s mirror can gather dust. If not cleaned, it will become filthy and dim. How can one be born to reach the other shore as a Buddha?”  

Chen Ping'an chuckled and added, “Both verses are good and correct. The reason I bring this up is that during my travels to Qingluan Kingdom, I heard scholars express disdain for the former and solely praise the latter. Moreover, several miscellaneous texts written by scholars tend to carry negative connotations toward the former, which I find a bit troubling.”  

Ma Duyi laughed, “I’ve rarely heard you mention Buddhism before, Mr. Chen. It seems you’ve delved into it quite a bit. I truly admire your broad knowledge…”  

Ma Duyi made a funny face, “I can’t go on anymore.”  

Chen Ping'an smiled, “That just shows your flattery skills need some work.”  

Afterward, the three riders encountered a scenic spot filled with an ethereal aura—a nameless deep pool. As autumn approached, it grew icy cold, resembling the chilling depths of winter. On the stone wall, there was an untraceable inscription in vermilion, “In ancient walls, colorful dragons with golden tails, rainwork enters autumn pond waters.” As they looked up, traces of painting could be discerned on the wall, faintly resembling a dragon, and at their feet, the pond water was emerald green, devoid of any fish or shrimp.  

Chen Ping'an withdrew his gaze and reached a hand into the pond. A chill ran through him, prompting a sudden memory of his hometown’s Ruan family shop built by the riverside, which had once taken advantage of the dark waters of Longxu River for trade. This deep pool was also suitable for tempering sword edges; however, it was unclear why no celestial sword cultivators had established a presence here. Chen Ping'an quickly retracted his hand as he realized the coldness of the water was not pure; it was mixed with many malevolent and impure energies, resembling a tangled mess. Although it wouldn’t immediately harm the human body, it was far from “pure,” and it was no wonder that this was a forbidden location for sword cultivators.  

Surely, there must have been stories here in the past.  

Perhaps it was akin to the Feiying Fortress and Shangyang Terrace in Tongye Continent.  

As Chen Ping'an continued his journey through Mei You Kingdom, he traversed rural areas and county towns, occasionally encountering children who, unaccustomed to seeing fine horses, would hide among the reeds. He also happened upon seemingly mundane itinerant cultivators and lively wedding processions filled with drums and laughter in the streets. After traveling thousands of miles and crossing mountains and rivers, the three riders unexpectedly came across a dilapidated tomb overgrown with grass, discovering an ancient sword embedded in a tombstone, with only the hilt visible. Even after hundreds of years, the sword still emanated a chilling aura, unmistakably a remarkable spiritual weapon. However, due to its age and lack of nurturing, it had reached the brink of disintegration. Ma Duyi considered taking it, reasoning that it was an unclaimed object and could be polished and repaired for a decent price. But Chen Ping'an refused, stating it was a tool for the Daoist to suppress the feng shui of the area, meant to contain the malevolent energies and prevent them from spreading and becoming a threat.  

As a ghostly being, Ma Duyi could certainly see the sword’s value, but he didn’t care much and simply laughed, “If we pull out the ancient sword and the tomb truly has demons appearing to cause trouble, we can simply exterminate them and gain a spiritual weapon, accumulating merit in the process. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?”  

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Past grievances are muddled; how do we know there are no hidden difficulties or complications within?”  

Ma Duyi grumbled, “Mr. Chen, you’re always so indecisive when it comes to action.”  

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Even a child can smash a bowl or a vase with all their might, and that counts as decisiveness. Zeng Ye can do it; that group of bandits could easily kill, and you could too. It’s certainly easier for me.”  

Chen Ping'an reflected, “The gathering of human hearts is a terrifying thing. When one enters an ancient temple alone, lighting incense and bowing to the Buddha, they feel reverence. But if it’s bustling and crowded, that fear diminishes. To take it a step further, there are surely people who would start pasting gold leaf on the Buddha’s statue. Once someone begins, others will follow suit.”  

As they rode through the mass grave, Chen Ping'an suddenly turned back to gaze behind, finding no one—neither people nor ghosts.  

Once, while resting beside a mountain lake, Zeng Ye picked up stones to skip across the water while Ma Duyi selected a quiet spot to remove her shoes and dip her feet into the cool water, stretching lazily with a smile. Just then, a young woodcutter, carrying a bundle of firewood, passed nearby, stopping in his tracks to stare at her in awe, mistaking her for a fairy. The boy felt a crush but was also embarrassed.  

Ma Duyi reached out to shoo away the dragonfly that had settled on her head, then turned to the boy, intending to startle him by suddenly revealing her fox fur.  

But Chen Ping'an threw a small stone, flicking her fingers away.  

Ma Duyi huffed and turned, splashing water everywhere.  

The boy quickly ran off.  

He didn’t plan to tell his peers back in the village that he had seen such a beautiful fairy by the lake, choosing instead to keep it to himself.  

In a bustling county town, even Chen Ping'an, who had seen much, was taken aback.  

A drunken scholar ran wildly through the streets, his body barely clothed, chest bare, staggering about in a boisterous manner, causing his attendant to carry a bucket filled with ink. The scholar used his head as a brush to write on the street.  

Servants stood at both ends of the street, surrounded by buckets of well water, waiting for their master to finish his madness so they could clean up the mess.  

That wasn’t even considered hard work; they bore the brunt of the ridicule yet dared not voice their anger toward the scholar, who, surprisingly, was a county magistrate with a reputation.  

Chen Ping'an halted his horse at the roadside, watching as the magistrate, exhausted, collapsed on the ground. Turning his head, the drunken youth, reeking of alcohol and ink, burst into loud laughter, “I honor the divine with my calligraphy! I dare ask if the divine has the courage to offer me guidance? Where are the immortal sages of yore? Come, let’s drink together…”  

Suddenly, the young man wailed, “In the capital, I once saw a princess competing for the road with a porter. I accidentally grasped the true essence of calligraphy. Seeing the princess in a temple, I again grasped the divine meaning of calligraphy! Princess, will you not take a look at the words I wrote for you?”  

Zeng Ye was puzzled, “Mr. Chen, what is he writing? I can’t understand a single word.”  

Chen Ping'an struggled to suppress his laughter, pointing at the ground and softly stating, “He’s writing wild cursive poetry about unrequited love. The last line he just finished is about the moonlight shining through the window screen, while the autumn ripples are delicate and yearning, inviting you to drink sweet wine together. He seems to be imagining it from the perspective of a woman he admires, writing a love poem for himself. However, these characters are truly exquisite, the best I’ve ever seen. I’ve encountered skilled calligraphers in regular script and running script, but this level of cursive is a first for me.”  

As he concluded, Chen Ping'an added, “Don’t think that the county magistrate is merely boasting; his words truly possess divine intent. The spiritual energy in this area is thin, and the guardian deities and ghosts cannot linger; otherwise, they would surely appear and pay their respects to him.”  

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an laughed and, leading his horse, walked toward the drunken, tearful scholar, “Let’s go buy some of his writings. Whatever you can get, buy it! This transaction will surely be profitable! It’s far better than picking up scraps. But the premise is that we live to be a hundred years or more.”  

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi exchanged glances, thinking that Mr. Chen must have lost his mind.  

Chen Ping'an approached the drunken scholar lying on the ground, smiling as he asked, “I have wine that rivals the finest celestial brew. May I buy some of your writings?”  

The drunken man, with bleary eyes, shook his head, “You seek me?”  

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, “Yes, I seek you.”  

Suddenly, the man burst into sorrowful tears, “You’re not a princess, so why should I be sought after? Why should I be sought after? Go away! I won’t sell you a single word!”  

Chen Ping'an turned to Ma Duyi, and as everyone’s attention shifted, he flicked his wrist, producing a jug of well-brewed wine from Fengwei Crossing. Releasing the reins of his horse, he crouched down, offering the jug to the scholar, “Will you sell? Try my wine first. If you still don’t wish to sell after tasting it, consider it my respect for your cursive writing on the street.”  

The scholar sat up, accepted the wine jug, and gulped it down in one go, tossing the empty jug aside. He swayed as he stood, grabbing Chen Ping'an's arm, “Is there more wine?”  

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Yes, but there’s not much left.”  

The young man was overjoyed, “Let’s go to that shabby yamen; I’ll write for you! As long as there’s enough wine, you can have as many as you want!”  

Ma Duyi rolled her eyes.  

Where had the scholar’s pride gone?  

Zeng Ye, however, felt pleased, glad to see Mr. Chen in such high spirits.  

Upon reaching the yamen, the scholar pushed aside the disordered books on the desk and ordered the attendant to bring out some rice paper and ink. Chen Ping'an set a jug of wine beside the scholar.  

On the walls hung the chaotic cursive that the scholar himself couldn’t recognize after sobering up.  

After drinking the wine, the scholar burped and asked, “What do you want this madman to write? For which discerning official or nobleman? Never mind, I don’t want to know. You can write what you want; it doesn’t count unless I want to write something.”  

The ink flowed like smoke, filling the room with a storm of excitement.  

The scholar truly wrote whatever came to his mind, often crafting countless words in a single stroke, leaving Zeng Ye feeling that this transaction was a loss.  

In the end, the drunken scholar, with decent capacity but poor drinking etiquette, penned dozens of varying-sized pieces before completely passing out, collapsing on the ground.  

Chen Ping'an ended up spending five jugs of well-brewed wine, old Longcheng osmanthus wine, and Shujian Lake’s crow's cry wine.  

The reason he could drink so much wasn’t that the scholar had an enormous capacity; it was just that he drank half a jug and spilled the rest, leaving Ma Duyi’s heart aching at the waste.  

Chen Ping'an collected the writings and left the yamen.  

As the three of them led their horses away, Ma Duyi couldn’t help but ask, “The writing is good; I can tell that much. But is it really that impressive? Those celestial brews are worth quite a bit of snowflake coin. Converted to silver, can a single piece of cursive truly be worth thousands or even tens of thousands of taels?”  

Chen Ping'an, having secured the writings, was overjoyed, as if he had drunk too much wine, confidently stating, “Don’t believe it? Just wait. One day, when you come back here, this street will surely be renowned far and wide. Even after hundreds of years, even if that scholar has passed, the entire county will bask in his glory and be remembered by future generations.”  

The three slowly left the small county town. At this moment, the townsfolk still regarded the drunken magistrate as a joke, unaware that future calligraphy masters and countless scholars would envy their good fortune to have witnessed such a man’s splendor.  

This Mid-Autumn Festival, Mei You Kingdom was relatively stable, with families reuniting.  

But in Shihou Nation, the situation was uncertain.  

Next Mid-Autumn Festival, Mei You Kingdom might very well mirror the current grim state of Shihou Nation.  

There are many spirits and monsters in the mountains and fields.  

Another year of autumn leaves falling and winter approaching.  

(End of Chapter)  

 **Chapter 511: Where My Heart Finds Peace (Part 2)**

As Chen Ping'an was about to finish his journey through the Plum Glaze Kingdom and return to Shujian Lake, he stumbled upon a remote, secluded mountain range. With his keen eyesight, he spotted a high cliff where an old ape, draped in ragged cloth and bound by iron chains, was hanging upside down. The moment it sensed Chen Ping'an's gaze, its expression turned ferocious, baring its teeth in a silent snarl. Though it didn’t roar or scream, the overwhelming aura of violence it exuded was truly terrifying. 

Nearby, there was an artificially carved stone cave. When Chen Ping'an looked over, he saw a gaunt young monk standing up, making eye contact with him. The monk pressed his palms together in a silent gesture of respect. 

Chen Ping'an mirrored the monk's gesture, bowing his head slightly in return. 

Ma Duyi, curious, asked, “What’s going on?” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, choosing not to speak. 

It wasn’t until they exited the mountain range that he finally replied, “A great monk is exerting immense willpower to subdue a rebellious heart demon manifested as that unruly ape.” 

Ma Duyi gasped in astonishment. “To manifest a heart demon like that, doesn’t that make this monk a true celestial being?” 

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Indeed, he is a hermit of the world.” 

Back at the stone cave, the young monk sat cross-legged on his mat again, stood up, and stepped out of the cave, gliding through the air with grace. He locked eyes with the gradually calming ape, whose gaze was a complex mix of resentment, hatred, longing, compassion, and mockery. 

The monk turned his head, seemingly puzzled. Why was his heart demon behaving so unusually today? It had never paid attention to the celestial beings who passed by on their flying swords or winds. 

Realization dawned on the young monk, and he smiled faintly. He once again pressed his palms together, chanted a soft Buddhist verse, and returned to the cave to continue his silent meditation. 

Meanwhile, an indifferent, solemn-looking elderly cultivator appeared at a chaotic burial ground, where ancient swords were driven into tombstones. Beneath the surface, dark energy surged. Even though it was apparent that he might be a celestial being of the mortal realm, the malevolent spirits lurking in the mountain roots still clung to their natures, gathering their sinister energy and attempting to break free from the ground. Yet every time a spirit surged upward, sword qi would rain down, causing wails of despair to echo from below. 

The old cultivator was certainly not afraid of these spirits. He merely frowned and muttered to himself, “How strange. They fear the aura of my Golden Core, yet they are not afraid of a young man with a mixed identity?” 

It was rare for him to find lodging in a celestial inn. 

Ma Duyi leaned back on the soft bedding, a look of bliss on his face. He was someone who could endure hardships but knew how to enjoy the good life. 

Zeng Ye, on the other hand, remained absorbed in his solitary cultivation within the room. 

Chen Ping'an ordered a celestial bulletin from the inn. Meanwhile, turmoil had begun to stir within the Plum Glaze Kingdom’s court, but the arguments weren’t about whether to fend off the barbarian forces of the Great Li, but rather about how to defend their territory to the last breath. 

This was a decision made even as the capital of the Shihou Kingdom had already fallen under siege. 

The disarrayed Shihou court finally welcomed its new emperor, the prince Han Jingling, reputed as the “Wise King.” He had emerged unscathed from the battlefield, becoming the foremost military commander of the Shihou Kingdom without losing a single soldier. Huang He, as a close friend of the new emperor Han Jingling, was similarly honored and appointed as Deputy Minister of Rites, bringing together father and son in the same court, along with a considerable number of Huang family members, all of whom prospered together and wielded significant influence over the government. 

From the capital of the Shihou Kingdom to the outskirts, officials and military commanders were willing to march bravely to their deaths. Even the minor act of posting the door gods from enemy nations at their doorsteps was something they hesitated to do. 

Some families, unwilling to let their patriarchs lead them to ruin, secretly posted portraits of the door gods from the Yuan and Cao clans of the Great Li. Others, more ruthless, bound their family heads to prevent them from tearing down the door gods, berating them for being unworthy descendants who shamed their ancestors. 

The myriad of human conditions—sweet and bitter—was known only to those experiencing it. 

The beautifully crafted celestial bulletin contained a plethora of trivial matters that were treated as entertainment for idle chats but were, in reality, life-and-death issues for those affected, leading to tragic events of family ruin and displacement. 

Compared to the inconspicuous Shihou Kingdom, the events unfolding at Shujian Lake were even more tumultuous and gripping. 

Since the start of autumn, Su Gaoshan had begun to settle scores. 

Islands like Grain Island, Oriole Island, and Qingzhong Tianmou had successively pledged their allegiance to the Song clan of the Great Li, willing to hand over half their riches and the significant ancestral genealogies. 

Su Gaoshan hosted a banquet at the Fan family residence in Pool Water City, but it was merely in his name. He sent a subordinate general of merely third rank and several cultivators drawn from various armies to represent him and entertain the assembly. 

Su Gaoshan was clearly unwilling to grant even this small courtesy to the local influential figures of Shujian Lake. 

Chen Ping'an was not surprised by this. 

Earlier, he had delivered a “name card” to the Great Li cavalry through Qingxia Island, expressing his desire to meet with the commander, but the reply from Su Gaoshan was blunt, unmistakably the general's own words: “Get lost.” 

He felt neither anger nor frustration, only a sense of helplessness. 

As for Qingxia Island, now without Liu Zhimo's presence, the forces led by Tian Hu Jun of Suru Island and Jin Dan Yu Kuai, along with several other influential Golden Core cultivators at Shujian Lake, were also seated at the banquet in the Fan residence. However, they were not seated at the front, even behind Tianmou Island. 

This was the way of the wild cultivators at Shujian Lake. 

They dared to fight fiercely and could also yield when necessary. In favorable situations, they could act like their ancestors; in dire straits, they could humble themselves. 

Chen Ping'an speculated that some island cultivators might be reluctant to simply hand over half their wealth, but it was likely that the forces on Grain Island, led by Tan Yuanyi and the Golden Core couple from Oriole Island, would assist Su Gaoshan in dealing with all “minor troubles,” negating the need for General Su to trouble himself. They would gladly present those heads and island assets to Su Gaoshan as gifts. 

However, the crux of Su Gaoshan's authority in Shujian Lake stemmed not only from his own military achievements and the discord among the wild cultivators but also from the unstoppable advance of another Great Li general, Cao Ping. Most importantly, it was rumored that the Great Li prince, Song Changjing, would personally accompany a prince of the Song clan to inspect the border where Cao Ping's forces clashed with the Zhu Ying dynasty. 

Chen Ping'an set down the bulletin. 

With his hands folded in his sleeves, he fell into deep thought. 

There was still no definitive news regarding Liu Zhimo's fate. 

Logically, Su Gaoshan would likely want to win over a seasoned cultivator like Liu Zhimo, who was adept at understanding the tides of fortune, especially since Liu Zhimo had been one of the first to pledge allegiance to the Great Li. 

The issue lay with the group of foreign cultivators from Gongliu Island, whom Liu Lao had described as having “unpleasant faces.” Their identities were still shrouded in mystery. 

It seemed this group had determined Liu Zhimo's life and death, and even Liu Lao had to grudgingly accept this, leaving Su Gaoshan unable to add any further glory to his accomplishments or secure an easily obtainable Yuan Ying patron for the Great Li. 

What a significant presence. 

Chen Ping'an rubbed his temples. 

Could it be the severely weakened Tongye Sect? Had they made the hard decision to relocate to Shujian Lake? 

Yet that would require an enormous price to pay. While cultivators could migrate en masse to other continents, the natural energies cultivated over thousands of years in the Tongye Sect's territory could not simply be taken away. 

Involving such a vast migration across two continents, aside from the spiritual energies of blessed lands, nothing else could be considered. 

Moreover, such a major upheaval would only scatter the already unstable hearts of the Tongye Sect. During the migration, predatory forces would surely pounce, and even a righteous sect like the Taiping Mountain Fuji Sect would not hesitate to strike if it decided to intervene. 

Additionally, Tongye Sect cultivators, who had grown accustomed to being top dogs on the main continent, would they truly be willing to take root in the small Biao Ping Continent and live under the thumb of the Great Li's Song clan? 

If it were the Fuji Sect, it would seem more plausible. 

Yet the actions of that group of cultivators against Liu Zhimo, especially their insidious schemes, made that reasoning fall apart. 

Chen Ping'an stood up and approached the window. This celestial inn was built by the riverside, offering a broad view. Outside, the river flowed tumultuously, with boats coming and going, appearing as small as grains of rice in the distance. 

The intricate water networks of the Plum Glaze Kingdom spread widely, likely one of the reasons its officials dared to fight to the death. 

On the river, a line of battle ships slowly made their way upstream. The vastness of the water made even the most formidable fleets seem insignificant. 

Chen Ping'an leaned against the windowsill. 

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi had come together, expressing a desire to visit the Water God Temple alongside the Spring Flower River. It was said that wishes made there were particularly effective, and the Water God enjoyed teasing mortal scholars. 

Chen Ping'an had no interest in such matters and let them go explore the temple on their own. However, he did remind Ma Duyi that once they entered the temple grounds, it was only proper to first pay respects to the Water God and declare their intentions. Otherwise, it could be seen as an offense to the local deities, leading to conflict. In that case, Ma Duyi would have to apologize and offer compensation to appease the spirits. After all, any divine expenses incurred would not fall on Chen Ping'an. 

Ma Duyi laughed and said he understood, remarking that after traveling so far, such simple etiquette shouldn’t need to be reiterated by Mr. Chen. 

Chen Ping'an couldn't help but smile. 

“You’ve only traveled through two vassal states so far, and you’re already calling it ‘this far’?” 

But he kept those thoughts to himself, waving them off to allow them to enjoy their outing. He knew he would end up teasing Ma Duyi again if he didn’t. 

Just as Zeng Ye was closing the door, Chen Ping'an took down the Sword-Feeding Gourd and tossed it to her, saying it was just in case. 

Zeng Ye was naturally delighted, but as soon as she closed the door, Ma Duyi snatched it away, hanging it at her waist. 

Zeng Ye was at a loss. 

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly at this. 

It was only natural for a man to give way to a woman, and for the strong to accommodate the weak. This wasn’t about condescending charity; it was simply the way of the world. 

In such a society, things would gradually improve and correct themselves. 

All principles and knowledge must return to their rightful order. 

The more one walked, the farther one would go. 

The more one thought, the more one would ponder. 

Feeling a mix of fatigue and lightness, Chen Ping'an simply rested his head on the windowsill, closed his eyes, and dozed off. 

Where my heart finds peace is my home. 

Wherever that home is, I can sleep. 

Dozens of miles away, at the Spring Flower River Water God Temple, an elderly man was lying on a beam in the main hall, gnawing on a chicken leg. He sported an apricot blossom hairpin and wore embroidered robes, looking quite comical. Suddenly, he jolted awake, nearly dropping the greasy chicken leg on the head of a temple visitor. This water spirit, born of a water creature and blessed by fate, had once been conferred a gold statue by a gentleman from the Lake Viewing Academy, allowing him to become a recognized deity of the rivers and to enjoy the incense of mortals. 

He soared into the air, his form becoming ethereal as he passed through the temple roof. The old water god looked around in a panic, bowing and paying respects in all directions, tremblingly exclaiming, “Which saint has graced us with their presence? This humble servant is terrified, truly terrified.” 

As for the “culprit.” 

He was busy stealing a moment of leisure, dozing off. 

Virtue stands tall, banishing all evils, allowing the deities to make way. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 512: The Bright Moon in the Sky (Part 1)**

Outside the window, the river flowed steadily, carrying echoes of the past through the ages. Leaning against the windowsill, Chen Ping'an had only closed his eyes for a moment, yet he already felt a sense of relaxation wash over him—a rare occurrence. It had been far too long since he had enjoyed a sweet, deep sleep.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi had yet to return, and Chen Ping'an couldn’t shake off the feeling of worry gnawing at him.

As he had suspected, after meeting with the informant Zhang Ye, they had returned to Shujian Lake before leaving Qingxia Island. This time, they had entered the Kingdom of Meiyou, and along the way, he had sensed the presence of someone shadowing them from a distance. This person’s realm was exceedingly high and their concealment profound, to the extent that Chen Ping'an only occasionally caught a vague hint of their presence. Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi remained blissfully unaware, and Chen Ping'an chose not to reveal anything, preferring not to raise their anxiety and risk exposing their true situation, which might lead to unnecessary trouble.

Even though their pursuer had not revealed any goodwill or hostility, it still left Chen Ping'an feeling as if a thorn was lodged in his back.

Previously, only a handful of cultivators at Shujian Lake could achieve such stealth. Liu Laocheng from the Jade Purity realm would scoff at such antics, while the old Nascent Soul cultivator Liu Zhimao would never act in such a manner.

The Song family of the Great Li Dynasty was also reluctant to add complications. Moreover, Chen Ping'an was ultimately one of their own, and Lu Baixiang and others had been registered under the Great Li. Even among the higher-ups of the Great Li, excluding Cui Zhan, no one would dare meddle in the affairs of Shujian Lake, especially not with Cui Zhan watching closely. Cui Zhan valued rules above all, and indeed, the customs of the Great Li—from the court to the military and up the mountains—were largely dictated by him.

Chen Ping'an was almost certain that their shadow was one of the foreign cultivators from Gongliu Island, most likely a second or third-in-command among them. The significance of Shujian Lake was immense; otherwise, they wouldn’t have moved to suppress Liu Zhimao. This implied that their leader needed to personally oversee matters at Gongliu Island, so it was likely that those following him were merely subordinates keeping an eye on him for future opportunities. Fortunately, they did not seem intent on directly killing him just yet; it appeared they had not devised a foolproof plan without risks. However, should they decide to act, it would undoubtedly be with overwhelming force.

In his heart, Chen Ping'an felt grateful to Liu Laocheng. Not only had Liu not plotted against him, but he had also refrained from watching from the sidelines. Instead, he had subtly warned Chen Ping'an and revealed a piece of heavenly secret. Of course, there was also the possibility that Liu Laocheng had informed the others about the jade tablet accompanying the worshiped saint in the temple, which would have caused the foreign cultivators to worry about their plans at Shujian Lake being ruined.

However, Chen Ping'an strongly believed that Liu Laocheng was a… remarkable person, with the former possibility being more likely.

It was a pity that Liu Laocheng was not the one with the final say over the situation at Shujian Lake. The painstakingly built chessboard was now at the mercy of Liu Zhimao, Tan Yuanyi, and Liu Laocheng, with Chen Ping'an himself and everyone else forced to stand aside.

But to say that all his efforts were for naught, Chen Ping'an did not quite agree. To accept one’s fate requires an understanding of it. Just as Chen Ping'an sought an audience with Su Gaoshan and received the rather domineering response of "Get lost," he could accept it calmly. After his trip to the Kingdom of Shihai, he had witnessed and heard much, combined with the earlier reports from Liu Xu Island. Chen Ping'an felt he had a fair understanding of Su Gaoshan’s character—a man from a cold lineage, who had endured hardships and built his foundation upon remarkable military achievements. Such a man, holding a high position, was exceptionally resilient, with a heart as solid as a rock. His mindset was akin to that of a great cultivator seeking the way of enlightenment (Dao). It was not hard to imagine that even those like Cui Zhan and Song Changjing, who issued orders to him, would regard Su Gaoshan with a degree of respect, even if they were not lacking in reprimands and accountability.

Yet accepting one’s fate was still a laborious endeavor, often leading to disappointment.

This sentiment was not too different from the appearance of Zhang Ye at Huo Luo Mountain.

Chen Ping'an wanted to reach for the sword gourd, take a drink, and only then remembered he had given it to Ma Duyi to hang at her waist. Instead, he returned to the table, thought for a moment, and pulled out the calligraphy works of that eccentric county magistrate, spreading the pieces of paper out to admire. No matter how he looked at it, he found them delightful.

It was a seamless flow, liberating and uninhibited.

Wasn't this akin to a martial artist delivering a punch?

With a dazzling spirit, moving gracefully back and forth, all was in harmony with the Dao.

Wasn't it similar to a sword immortal drawing their sword?

There were always some universal truths in the world.

Each piece of calligraphy bore the unique seal of the young county magistrate, most often with a single seal per piece and rarely two on one.

One of the works boasted grandly, "If you hold my scroll by the water’s edge, fear not, for every character shall transform into a dragon. If you hold my scroll at night to roam, the ghosts and gods shall leave no trace." 

With two seals adjacent, reading "Young Dragon's Qi Strong" and "Thin Dragon, Fat Spirit."

Another scroll had three seals stamped consecutively, and Chen Ping'an vividly recalled the magistrate's energetic actions as he laughed heartily like a celestial being, exclaiming, "I encountered a fool who sold me celestial characters brewed with divine wine—what a delight!" The seals read "Kaiyuan," "Changshu," and "Ink Pool Celestial."

Chen Ping'an carefully tucked them away.

He vowed to keep them safe at Luopo Mountain, never to sell them, no matter the price offered, as they would become family heirlooms to be passed down!

Thinking of this made Chen Ping'an unable to contain his joy, his face lighting up with a smile.

Stretching lazily, he placed his hands in his sleeves, turning to gaze at the flowing river.

Once, he had copied a beautiful verse from a book, inscribed on a bamboo slip, carrying with it an immense meaning.

"The falling woods stretch across mountains, the distant sky vast; the clear river reflects the bright moon."

As he took in the grand river view outside, his heart expanded along with it.

Mr. Qi, about the things I could not achieve at Hanging Mountain, I believe I may have achieved now, after all my efforts.

When Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi returned, Zeng Ye was in high spirits, claiming they had indeed met the Water God of Chunhua River, a gracious figure adorned with flowers and embroidery, who had personally shown them around the Water God Temple.

Ma Duyi rolled her eyes, remarking that the old man’s gaze made her uncomfortable, particularly when he looked at the sword gourd at her waist.

Chen Ping'an had little to say about that.

Chunhua River was the largest river in the Kingdom of Meiyou, and the kingdom had always respected the Water God. As the foremost deity of the river, the Water God of Chunhua River was certainly no ordinary figure.

In fact, Chen Ping'an had encountered numerous water deities. The earliest was Wei Bo from Qiduan Mountain, who had once been a half-spirit, half-ghost. Then there was the martial deity of the Xiuhua River, who had appeared beside Gu Can’s father, and the goddess of the River of Buried Waters from Tongye Island. He had also faced a pair of rival deities that shook the mountains and rivers during his journey through the Great Spring Dynasty. Not to mention the troublesome Bai Hu River goddess he had met in Ziyang Prefecture of Huangting Kingdom.

He just wondered about the relationship between the Qingyi child and his river friend, the River God, on Luopo Mountain.

Wei Bo and Zhu Lian had sent messages to Qingxia Island via flying swords, mentioning this matter to some extent. However, they did not elaborate much, only stating that the River God of Huangting had received a peace talisman and had visited Longquan County personally, where the Qingyi child hosted a welcoming banquet for him. Afterward, the Qingyi child rarely mentioned this loyal and righteous brother again.

Chen Ping'an felt somewhat worried, but the few words in the letter made it difficult to casually remind the Qingyi child of anything.

To outsiders, the Qingyi child’s almost naive sense of brotherhood was something Chen Ping'an did not resent at all. In fact, he found it to be one of the most admirable qualities about him.

Being a bit foolish was far better than being shrewd yet lacking intelligence.

At least in Chen Ping'an’s Luopo Mountain, this was crucially important.

Because this was Chen Ping'an’s little world, governed by rules he set himself. His personal preferences were akin to the old Daoist in the Guandao Temple, revered as "Heavenly Father" in a lotus flower blessed land.

Outside that defined realm, many worldly cleverness and the relentless pursuit of greatness were entirely different. Chen Ping'an believed in this, and he did not even regard it as dislike; rather, he found it commendable in many ways. For instance, Sun Jiashu, who possessed an entire hundred-mile long street outside the Old Dragon City, was not just clever; he had a unique wisdom in dealing with the world. But ultimately, Chen Ping'an had to part ways with Sun Jiashu when they left the Sun family estate. However, by the time he took the ferry out of Old Dragon City, Chen Ping'an’s impression of Sun Jiashu had deepened.

It was akin to how a single grain of rice could nurture countless lives.

Being willing to appreciate others’ strengths prevented one from getting stuck in a rut.

One must also recognize the differences between oneself and others to understand why some lived well while others did not.

Contemplating these matters, turning them over in his mind again and again.

Much like the young county magistrate’s chaotic calligraphy, which at first glance seemed utterly illegible to Zeng Ye, but fundamentally, weren't they just individual characters?

However, appreciating the strokes and marveling at the divine artistry, one could say, "I don’t recognize the characters, nor do they recognize me." A rough glance at the momentum was sufficient, and not looking was equally fine. Yet when everyone finds themselves in this intricate world, if you do not understand the various rules and constraints—especially those at the most basic and easily overlooked levels—life will teach you how to live. This is unrelated to good and evil; the Dao is impartial, seasons change, and time flows. No one is spared from suffering, only to later lament, “If I had known…”

Chen Ping'an felt a twinge of anxiety; that little firewood boy carrying a golden sword gourd had said he would relocate to another realm. Did that mean the lotus flower blessed land would also move to the realm of Qingming? What about the national teacher of Nanyuan, Zhong Qiu, and Cao Qinglang? Would he have a chance to see them again? Would time flow in the blessed land be controlled by the old Daoist? What if when Chen Ping'an returned to the blessed land, Zhong Qiu had already become an ancient figure with a beautiful posthumous title in the annals of Nanyuan? What about Cao Qinglang?

Chen Ping'an had always kept the kind-hearted child Cao Qinglang in his thoughts.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi sat at the table, chatting casually and snacking on melon seeds, when they unknowingly noticed that their Mr. Chen seemed to be a bit troubled again.

Fortunately, this worry was different from before. It wasn’t heavy, just a fleeting melancholy about a certain someone or something, like the green ant floating on the surface of wine, not transforming into the sorrow of aged wine.

Yet this accountant had always kept his joys and sorrows to himself, suffering alone.

This left both Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye feeling a bit disappointed.

A knock came at the door, and the riverside inn brought them the latest news from the Kingdom of Meiyou, freshly compiled, exuding the unique fragrance of long-lasting ink.

After thanking them, Chen Ping'an skimmed through it twice and handed it to Ma Duyi, exclaiming helplessly, “Su Gaoshan has begun a major offensive against the Kingdom of Meiyou. The border near Liuzhou has completely fallen.”

The report detailed this situation thoroughly.

Zhou Mi, one of the three naval commanders of the Kingdom of Meiyou, who was responsible for guarding the upper reaches of Chunhua River, had defected to the Great Li cavalry. He intended to lead his forces in rebellion and secretly contacted the Great Li. However, the emperor of Meiyou, having sensed something amiss, dispatched several royal supplicants to eliminate him. Among the Great Li cultivators accompanying Zhou Mi, three had perished, one of whom was a local Golden Core earth immortal. Su Gaoshan was furious and ordered his three generals to sign a military pledge, vowing to capture three locations in the Kingdom of Meiyou within a month, encircling the stubborn capital, while also proclaiming he would cut off the emperor's head to use as a wine vessel during the Qingming Festival next year.

Zeng Ye was merely there for the spectacle and didn’t quite understand the details, but she lamented how powerful the Great Li cavalry was, exuding an overwhelming aura.

Cultivators on the mountain often lacked deep feelings for their homeland. The longer they cultivated and distanced themselves from the mundane world, the more indifferent they became.

They would watch with detached eyes.

Otherwise, if their cultivation was insufficient, they had never truly stood atop the mountain and would be swept away by the prevailing tide, compelled to descend.

Thus, the middle-aged Daoist Chen Ping'an had encountered by the stream, who voluntarily descended to aid the common folk at the foot of the mountain, earned Chen Ping'an's respect. However, Daoist cultivation is riddled with inner demons and confusion, and outsiders could hardly speak of such matters. Chen Ping'an did not believe that the middle-aged Daoist must steadfastly cultivate their heart and perform good deeds in the human world to be on the right path; otherwise, they would be falling into the lower tiers.

Ma Duyi considered things more deeply than Zeng Ye and asked, puzzled, “Why is Su Gaoshan in such a hurry to subdue the Kingdom of Meiyou? Although I am not familiar with military affairs, I have walked those roads in Meiyou and know that their waterways are complex and unsuitable for the Great Li cavalry’s rapid assaults.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “We refer to them as the Great Li cavalry, but they are not solely a cavalry force. It’s just that the Great Li is renowned for its cavalry, easily leading one to misinterpret them as merely foot soldiers. Throughout the journey south, what kind of dynasties and vassals have they not faced? The fall of the Kingdom of Meiyou is an inevitable trend. However, you are correct; taking down the Kingdom of Meiyou in such haste will certainly cost more than breaching the capital of Shihai. The losses on both sides will be greater, and the hidden intricacies may be known only to Su Gaoshan himself. I believe someone is urging him and Cao Ping along, such as the true backbone of the Great Li cavalry, Prince Song Changjing.”

Ma Duyi hesitated, “Why does it seem that you are not particularly concerned about battlefield matters? The lives and deaths of those soldiers are not as important to you as the common people?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and traced a circle on the table with his finger. “There’s a saying from my hometown, ‘If the jar breaks at the well’s edge, the general is bound to die on the battlefield.’ To immerse oneself in the battlefield means tying one’s life to the waist. Just like the general spirit at the Lingguan Temple, do you think he regretted sacrificing himself for the nation after death? And what of those rogue soldiers in the small county town who fought with the common folk for food—would that young soldier truly wish to draw his sword against the people?”

Chen Ping'an drew a larger circle. “You may not realize this, but earlier in Shihai, I stopped a young monster who wanted to kill someone in a dog meat shop in a county city and even gifted him a… divine coin. However, if the demon race were to launch a full-scale invasion of the Haoran world one day, even if I knew that among the demons would be the ancient fox spirit from the old temple and that boy who ultimately chose not to kill, when faced with an overwhelming army, with only me standing before them and the city and the common folk behind me, what should I do? Should I go into battle and ask the demons one by one why they intend to kill and if they would choose not to?”

Chen Ping'an spoke calmly, “If I have chosen to stand in their way, it means I am prepared to die if necessary. The same goes for them if they have made it this far. The sages of military strategy who oversee ancient battlefields are like the sages of Confucianism at the academies or Daoist masters at their temples—why do they have the advantage of time, place, and people? This is partly the reason. When they find themselves in the midst of it, outsiders must adapt to local customs.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Do you understand what I mean?”

Zeng Ye honestly shook her head.

Ma Duyi asked, “I grasp the general idea, but there’s another question. If outsiders can forcibly break through the sage's domain, does that not imply the original reasoning is flawed?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “That indicates you have not thought through why the sage can oversee the world. That is the root of the issue, the thread of the lineage, the start of the sequence. After that, you may wonder why they were still broken through by external forces, seemingly unreasonable outsiders defeating those who make sense. As for why I say ‘seemingly,’ it becomes more complex. If we meet actual situations in the future, I will explain them to you in detail. Otherwise, you will only feel increasingly confused, as if there are reasons everywhere, yet everyone is unreasonable.”

Ma Duyi nodded, “Okay, I will await that.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “But I hope that opportunity never arises.”

Ma Duyi appeared even more perplexed.

Chen Ping'an slowly said, “We have witnessed the misfortunes of the Shihai Kingdom firsthand. Only poets and heroes remain lucky; the sounds of a nation’s demise, the words of grief and anger, and those loyal ministers and generals who perished alongside their country are easiest to be remembered by history. We have also traveled through the Kingdom of Meiyou, where the hardworking common folk and diligent literati live relatively stable lives. Which do you think is luckier, the Shihai Kingdom or the Kingdom of Meiyou?”

The answer was evident.

(End of Chapter)

### Chapter 513: The Bright Moon in the Sky (Part Two)

To die gallantly is ultimately a choice made out of necessity. Not regretting it doesn’t mean one isn’t filled with remorse. Living well, even if it isn’t particularly pleasant, remains the most fundamental desire of all mankind.

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, "We often overlook many simple truths. It’s hard for us to empathize with the suffering of others, but isn’t that also our fortune?" 

Even the best of people cannot truly feel the deep pain experienced by others. 

Back in the day, in the city of Yanzhi in the country of Caiyi, the young Zhao Shu, wielding a machete, fiercely protected a little girl. Why did she choose to believe only in Chen Ping'an? Because children are often more sincere, more sensitive to suffering, and harder to resist. The little girl nicknamed Luan Luan sensed a shared joy and sorrow in Chen Ping'an, as they were both in similar circumstances. It wasn't that, in her eyes, Chen Ping'an was necessarily better than the other good-hearted girl beside her.

At that moment, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye exchanged glances.

With a calm expression, Chen Ping'an continued, "But where does this fortune come from, where people live in bliss without realizing it? Shouldn’t we know and cherish it? When everyone is unwilling to delve deeper into this matter, and disaster strikes, shouldn’t we refrain from lamenting? Heaven likely won’t listen to our grievances, right? Hence, the Bodhisattva sitting upside down on that divine platform. However, I still believe that at such a critical moment, scholars should take on some responsibility. They have read more books than ordinary people, achieved fame, and enjoyed greater blessings, so they ought to shoulder more burdens."

Chen Ping'an gently placed both hands on the armrests of his chair.

When everyone else is slouched in their seats, trying to find comfort, with the joints of the furniture loose and the chairs swaying, the world becomes unstable. This is why Confucianism emphasizes the importance of studying and self-cultivation, insisting on sitting upright, with a gentleman being cautious in solitude.

Having seen Shujian Lake, he felt such disappointment.

Yet, as Chen Ping'an left Shujian Lake, traveled further, and pondered more, his disappointment waned.

After a brief two-day rest, they departed from the celestial inn and headed towards the southernmost territory of Meiyou Kingdom.

During their journey south, Chen Ping'an encountered a down-and-out scholar whose attire and manner revealed an impressive family background.

The scholar, disillusioned with the political path and not lacking in silver, had hired horse-drawn carriages and attendants to accompany him in exploring dangerous and beautiful mountains and rivers. However, among them, someone had malicious intent, teaming up with two others to conspire against him, nearly pushing the poetic scholar off a cliff. Had it not been for a kind-hearted porter who desperately intervened, the scholar would have met his end before Chen Ping'an could act, and afterward, his family might not even find his remains.

After stopping the situation, Chen Ping'an inquired how the scholar planned to deal with his attendants. The scholar was quite remarkable, not only compensating them fairly but also remembering their household registrations, warning them that should they dare to do wrong again, he would ensure that old and new accounts would be settled, with a beheading expected for any grave sins. He left only the porter who had helped him.

Then, the scholar insisted on traveling with Chen Ping'an, altering his route to head south together.

The scholar was instantly smitten with Ma Duyi.

Chen Ping'an, not blind to this, noticed it clearly, as did Zeng Ye.

Moreover, the scholar's attempts to impress were rather clumsy, making small talk with Chen Ping'an, discussing current affairs, or composing poetry admiring the stunning scenery.

Ma Duyi found it quite bothersome, wishing for Chen Ping'an to put away his paper talismans and symbols, preferring to avoid it all.

If the scholar hadn’t maintained a semblance of scholarly decorum and modesty, Zeng Ye felt inclined to curse him out for overindulging in his complaints.

The scholar was evidently a scion of a noble family in Meiyou Kingdom; otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense for him to exude such pride, having presumably achieved the top score in the imperial examinations and then served in the capital's Hanlin Academy and the Ministry of Revenue before being posted to a local position. He had implemented various measures to combat corruption in the local government.

He genuinely aspired to be a good official, to earn the reputation of a venerable lord.

Unfortunately, after his term ended, he was met with nothing but scorn. He was criticized behind his back by his subordinates for being pedantic and failing to secure benefits for them, while local gentry condemned him for being ignorant of practical affairs. The common people also berated him, accusing him of seeking fame at the expense of public welfare.

One day, in a moment of sorrowful reflection, after drinking too much, the scholar found himself in tears, momentarily dropping his façade of a cultured gentleman before Ma Duyi.

Chen Ping'an didn’t say much.

He merely shared his rough views on honest and good officials, discussing the merits of the former and the challenges faced by the latter.

The scholar listened intently, intoxicated and indignant, claiming that the complacency found in official circles was unacceptable. If one were to sink into the same corrupt practices, what good was being a scholar, or an official? A true scholar should rely on genuine talent, step by step, rise to a crucial position, and purify the toxic atmosphere; otherwise, they might as well not be an official at all, for it would betray the teachings of the sages in their books.

Chen Ping'an smiled and acknowledged the validity in his words.

He refrained from further persuasion.

It wasn’t that Chen Ping'an thought the scholar’s reasoning was flawed or that his ideas were naive. It was the kind of troubling situation faced by individuals like him. 

Chen Ping'an had witnessed it firsthand.

Wu Yan, a disciple of the National Teacher, had faced numerous setbacks when he first became the county magistrate in Longquan. One might wonder, did those powerful families fear Cui Qian? Yet they acted like amiable soft nails, secretly embedded both inside and outside the government office, leaving Wu Yan stressed and his official career unsteady. Eventually, he had to "move out" of the small town, seeking a position with the direct descendants of the influential Yuan and Cao families. As Longquan was upgraded from a county to a prefecture, Wu Yan naturally ascended from county magistrate to prefect. However, Chen Ping'an would boldly assert that Wu Yan's reputation in the court of the Great Li had hit rock bottom. Having connections and backing might lead to temporary smooth sailing, but it was impossible to maintain such ease for a lifetime. The difficulties faced, whether by the wealthy or the children of the powerful, could be equally disheartening.

In truth, back then, Wu Yan had once confided a heartfelt truth to a certain young man from a noble family in the capital, clarifying the difference between asking for contributions to write plaques for the Wende Temple and soliciting help from families to break the deadlock in Longquan. The affection from incense offerings was not merely between friends; even within families, it could run dry, so one must not misuse it.

If Chen Ping'an had heard of this matter now, he might have sat down with Wu Yan for a drink, as that single statement would be worth a bottle of good wine.

At Ouhua Fudi, Chen Ping'an had encountered many descendants of established families who, upon being posted to local positions, believed they could easily navigate the system, only to find that many moved from glory to obscurity, then to complete silence. Along the way, some took shortcuts, gaining temporary advantages, but local officials would silently resent them, increasingly banding together to exclude those from the capital, growing more skilled and insidious in their tactics, treating them like fools to toy with.

Thus, while Chen Ping'an currently held some apprehension towards the once-ordinary but now powerful Su Gaoshan, he would not underestimate Cao Ping, who had a prestigious surname and enjoyed numerous advantages at the outset of his official career.

Ma Duyi was furious, having held in her anger for too long. Just as she was about to speak up, Chen Ping'an shook his head, signaling her to remain silent.

Chen Ping'an could genuinely understand the scholar's predicament.

It mirrored his own situation at Shujian Lake.

Should he conspire with Liu Zhimao, his sworn enemy, to establish rules for Shujian Lake? Not doing so would naturally save him trouble, but if he did, it would bring him internal discord. At times, in the dead of night, he would have to introspect and question whether his conscience had been compromised, fearing that one day he might end up like Gu Can, taking a wrong step and finding himself unable to turn back, unwittingly becoming the very person he once detested.

Chen Ping'an respected the scholar's choice.

Perhaps not becoming an official, with his talent and family background, after decades of diligent study, and with many students across the nation, could be an even better solution?

Indeed.

That beautiful possibility lay ahead on the scholar's path.

How could Chen Ping'an bear to say a word of reproach, that the scholar was wrong for not striving to be a conscientious person for the sake of the common people? Gaining another good official for the court would mean losing a true scholar for the nation. The weighing of choices and gains was something Chen Ping'an dared not hastily judge.

All these thoughts, twisting and turning, were reflections from the books he read and his own contemplations.

Many sayings he once only knew to be virtuous but didn’t understand their true significance, from Mr. Qi, Ah Liang, and Old Man Yao, as well as various figures inscribed on bamboo slips, had become increasingly clear. It was as if someone had pulled the threads together, laying the truths bare in the light.

With gathering comes parting.

Even if the scholar liked Ma Duyi dearly, even if he was indifferent to her aloofness, he still had to return to the capital, enjoying the beauty of mountains and rivers was ultimately not the profession of a scholar.

At the moment of parting, he finally revealed his family background, for in the future, if Mr. Chen ever sought him out for a drink or asked for directions, he ought to have an address, right?

The scholar turned out to be the legitimate grandson of the Minister of Works in Meiyou Kingdom.

Meeting and drinking together is fine, but parting doesn’t preclude further meetings for drinks. This, perhaps, is the essence of good camaraderie in the jianghu.

Zeng Ye still found it hard to understand why Mr. Chen would spend time with a mere bookish scholar, having accompanied him on an unnecessary detour of over a hundred miles through scenic landscapes.

Even if the scholar was the grandson of a minister, what of it? Zeng Ye felt Mr. Chen didn’t need to deliberately befriend such a person.

It wasn’t worth it.

Not to mention Mr. Chen; even Zeng Ye, a wild cultivator yet to step into the fifth realm, felt that there was no connection between their pride and whether they belonged to mountain cultivators or not. Zeng Ye had encountered similar individuals and situations; saving someone after a drink was enough. 

However, upon considering that it was Mr. Chen, Zeng Ye felt reassured. Ma Duyi had previously mentioned that Mr. Chen was not straightforward, and Zeng Ye had a similar impression. Yet he felt there was something good about Mr. Chen, and perhaps when he reached the same level of cultivation and mindset as Mr. Chen, he might have a chat with that scholar again?

Zeng Ye's aspiration for cultivation had quietly shifted from a desperate grip on Mr. Chen’s sleeve to wanting to live more richly, even when he eventually left Mr. Chen, distinguishing himself from the wild cultivators of Maoyue Island and even the entire Shujian Lake.

For instance, perhaps he could be more patient with the mundane Confucian scholars down the mountain?

Zeng Ye might not have thought deeply enough at this point, but he had begun to ponder.

The tall youth likely didn’t realize that the boy from Mud Bottle Lane, who had walked this path, had ultimately become the account manager he was today.

After parting ways with the scholar, the three riders arrived at a city in the southernmost part of the Meiyou Kingdom called Jingzhou. The highest-ranking official there wasn’t the governor but the head of the transport army’s office, who ranked just below the transport supervisor. Chen Ping'an stayed for ten days, having discovered that this place was rich in spiritual energy, far better than ordinary towns, benefiting the cultivation of Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye. He selected a large inn by the water for them to cultivate in peace while he himself strolled through the city, during which he heard quite a bit of news. 

The transport commander had a single son, who was of mediocre talent, had no hopes for the imperial examinations, and was disinterested in an official career, instead spending his time in brothels, earning a notorious reputation. However, he had a peculiar habit of having servants catch and torture cats, dogs, and raccoon dogs for amusement.

Consequently, a shocking rumor soon spread from the transport commander’s office: the commander’s only son had been dismembered, meeting a fate akin to those cats and dogs he had tormented, with his mouth stuffed with cotton and left on his bed. The young man, though severely injured, had not died, which enraged the commander. Convinced that demons were to blame, he threw money at the problem, hiring two celestial masters from nearby immortal residences to subdue the demons, hoping they could also heal his crippled son.

At that time, Chen Ping'an happened to be walking along the transport canal and witnessed a group of celestial masters arriving in a small boat.

The leader at the bow was surprisingly a Dragon Gate realm cultivator.

For a vassal state like Meiyou Kingdom, hiring a Dragon Gate cultivator was a considerable expense, indicating that the transport commander's residence was indeed wealthy.

In addition to facilitating the cultivation of Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, there was another hidden reason for choosing to linger in Jingzhou.

According to reports from the celestial residence at Chunhua River, the recently emerged blue-clad woman and white-clad youth had once intercepted a Golden Core sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty, who was reputed to be "on the verge of entering the Nascent Soul realm," in the skies above Jingzhou. Besides this encounter, there had been three more "halted" battles in Jingzhou, ultimately resulting in the slaying of the sword cultivator at the border between Meiyou Kingdom and Zhu Ying Dynasty.

Chen Ping'an speculated that Cui Dongshan and Miss Ruan Xiu were "fishing," luring one or two Nascent Soul sword cultivators away from their mountain strongholds, drawing them into the territory of Meiyou Kingdom to save the Golden Core sword cultivator, a national treasure with great potential.

Otherwise, with Cui Dongshan's Nascent Soul cultivation and his array of magical treasures, he wouldn’t need to trouble himself.

It was highly likely that hidden along the borders of Meiyou Kingdom were military figures like Ruan Qiong or Mo family’s Xu Ruo. Even if both were present, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t be surprised.

Indeed, the Dragon Gate realm cultivator, along with a group of less powerful counterparts, managed to heal that young nobleman, though he would walk with a limp from then on and could never lift heavy objects again. The respective celestial masters, using their secret treasures and a spirit creature, followed leads and that night managed to track down the audacious creature that had attacked the transport commander’s residence, leading to a bloody battle in the city. Each celestial master fought fiercely, while the creature merely evaded, constantly in peril.

In truth, being able to torment the transport commander’s son so effortlessly, sneaking in and out without alerting anyone, indicated that killing the young man would have been easy; the creature simply chose not to kill, only to injure.

Throughout the night, Chen Ping'an remained at the city walls, observing the proceedings with folded arms.

If it hadn’t been for the creature’s foolishness in choosing a path that hindered its escape, the night in Jingzhou would have surely resulted in heavy casualties, not because subduing demons was wrong, but because the celestial masters acted recklessly without regard for consequences.

Ultimately, the creature managed to escape the city.

The celestial masters, like butterflies flitting over the city walls, left behind the transport officials who could merely shout in vain, continuing their pursuit out of the city. Those within the city would never suspect that the two groups of celestial masters, initially charging out in a grand display, soon came to a halt, even after losing track of the creature, deliberately unleashing their magical devices to create stunning displays in an empty area.

Meanwhile, the old Dragon Gate realm master, who had not exerted himself throughout, shifted direction as he left the city, quietly departing the demon-hunting troop.

Chen Ping'an leaped down from the city wall, following him from a distance.

In the mountains over twenty miles outside Jingzhou, Chen Ping'an stood on a tree branch, watching as the old cultivator, after a fierce battle, successfully bound the bloodied white raccoon dog with a silver magical binding rope.

The old cultivator, grinning, approached Chen Ping'an and asked, "What’s this? Want to join in on the fun?"

Chen Ping'an floated down to the ground, smiling, "Old master, you’ve done well. I’ll go back to the transport commander’s residence and say a few words about the difficulties of taming a great demon. Everyone in the city saw your efforts—spectacular, indeed! I’m sure the commander won’t sleep well tonight and will be compelled to hand over a large sum of celestial coins, pleading with you to catch the demon. Meanwhile, you secretly capture the creature and later present a freshly transformed raccoon spirit to the transport commander for his satisfaction. Everybody wins."

The old cultivator stroked his beard and laughed, "You young man have quite the insight. Among my dull disciples, there are a few who are quite clueless. You’ve only watched for a while and already grasp the nuances."

Chen Ping'an joked, "Old master, you aren’t planning to silence me, are you?"

The old cultivator burst into hearty laughter, "I’m not some maniacal wild cultivator who would forsake family and mentors for riches. Speak your price; if it’s reasonable, consider it a windfall for you—after all, horses don’t grow fat without night grass."

Chen Ping'an asked, "What do you intend to do with this creature you've captured?"

The old cultivator lifted the magical binding rope in his hand, the creature howling in distress. "After all, it’s a demon that has cultivated to the Observation Sea realm. Once I take it back to my mountain gate and train it, dispelling its hostility, it can serve as a guardian offering. Not to brag, but this is also its chance for a grand destiny."

Chen Ping'an nodded, chuckling, "There’s truth in that, but I still advise you to think carefully—don’t use that binding rope on me."

The old cultivator's expression darkened, "You young man, truly don’t know what’s good for you. You’re measuring me with a petty heart. Aren’t you afraid that good fortune might turn into disaster?"

Chen Ping'an’s hands were tucked into his sleeves as he reigned in his smile, "You should actually be grateful to this creature. Otherwise, given how much havoc you’ve caused in the city, you’d be half-dead by now."

The old Dragon Gate cultivator seemingly found Chen Ping'an's words to be a great joke, laughing heartily, causing leaves to flutter down.

Chen Ping'an sighed, "Earning wealth is a skill, and the profits you reap are ill-gotten gains of the transport officials. I find that quite commendable. However, disregarding the lives of the common people and then teaming up with others to wait for them to come and catch demons while committing murder isn’t quite virtuous."

The old cultivator regarded the young man, who initially appeared somewhat weak.

The more he looked, the more he felt something was off.

And the more he began to feel apprehensive.

For cultivators, once a true enmity is formed, it often leads to complete annihilation, or else it results in entangled grievances lasting a century.

Chen Ping'an proposed, "How about I buy it from you?"

The old cultivator hesitated.

Chen Ping'an tossed out a jade token.

It was a token of the top-tier offerings from Qingsha Island.

The old cultivator didn’t dare to reach out to catch it, as cultivator techniques could be extraordinarily varied; who would dare to be careless?

Chen Ping'an did not retrieve the jade token early, allowing it to hover in the air as the Dragon Gate realm old cultivator scrutinized it closely, then tossed out a Gu Yu coin. "Currently, our Qingsha Island is somewhat chaotic, lacking the prestige of the past. Since you’re a notable celestial master in Meiyou Kingdom, you wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for this. Thus, this magical binding rope would have been mine by now, and should you take the money, it would ensure a peaceful resolution. Otherwise, you and your disciples will have to hide in the mountains and cultivate in peace for the rest of your lives."

Chen Ping'an smiled and added, "Of course, one Gu Yu coin isn’t quite fair, but is the price fair enough to match this jade token? Right, old master?"

With a slap, he summoned two flying swords, which zipped away in a flash.

The old cultivator’s eyelids twitched; he waved his sleeve to push the jade token back towards the young "sword immortal" in the green cotton coat, then accepted the Gu Yu coin, bowing and laughing, "We only get acquainted through this exchange. If you trust me, you can come visit us at Longpan Mountain in the future."

Chen Ping'an pocketed the jade token, and the two flying swords returned to his storage. He smiled, "With your business acumen, I wouldn't dare to come and offer money."

The old cultivator laughed heartily, shaking the magical binding rope, letting the snow-white raccoon dog tumble to the ground. He put away the magical item and said a few more assertive words, "As long as Qingsha Island remains stable on Shujian Lake, this little Longpan Mountain will only send money and won’t dare to accept gifts. If one day Qingsha Island disappears, I hope we won’t meet again; otherwise, it would affect our friendship."

The old cultivator was straightforward, and after leaving those words, he departed without hesitation.

Chen Ping'an leaped onto a branch, and after a moment, floated down to the ground, truly gone.

The snow-white raccoon dog, curled up on the ground, tended its wounds while staring wide-eyed at the young cultivator.

Was he really a sword cultivator?

After descending, she didn’t dare to flaunt herself, having not encountered many mountain cultivators, so this was her first time meeting a real sword cultivator.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "Let’s go. Don’t show weakness; I know you can’t fight, but you can walk freely now. Remember, don’t appear in Jingzhou again for a while."

She blinked.

Chen Ping'an teased, "What, do you think I wasted your chance for fortune at Longpan Mountain?"

She spoke in a clear voice, "Longpan Mountain raises a very terrifying evil python, a true guardian offering, keen on devouring monsters, so that old badger was deceiving you. You must be careful in the future."

Chen Ping'an nodded, indicating he would be cautious, then didn’t step forward but squatted down, "Isn’t it strange why I, a wild cultivator from Shujian Lake, would save you?"

She hurriedly clamped her mouth shut, not saying a word.

Chen Ping'an smiled and tossed out a small porcelain vial, which rolled to a stop in front of the snow-white raccoon dog. "If you’re worried, you can keep it for now and not eat it."

She finally couldn’t help but ask, "Young master, what do you want?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Then let me ask you, what were you trying to achieve when you almost got caught in the city to avoid harming the innocent?"

She narrowed her eyes in amusement; her demeanor, like that of a young woman, made her quite endearing. With a coy tone, she replied, "Young master, we are kindred spirits, aren’t we?"

But soon, she wore a slightly apologetic expression.

She felt that saying this was somewhat unfair to her benefactor.

Because for those of them lucky enough to be born human, among the insults hurled at them, there exists the phrase "worse than beasts."

Chen Ping'an remained noncommittal, waving his hand. "Let’s go. Human hearts are treacherous and frightening. In the future, don’t take your cultivation for granted and play around in the human world. You’ve already triumphed once against the heavens; that’s why you have your current cultivation. You must cherish it. But when you contend with people, you won’t stand a chance against those wild cultivators or celestial masters. Go on and be careful when you stroll through the world again. And never think you’ll always encounter someone like me. How do you know that today’s good person won’t become a bad person in the future?"

She gently raised a paw, "Shhh," and smiled, "Someone who can say such things wouldn’t become a bad person, I don’t believe it."

Chen Ping'an, with his hands in his sleeves, squatted there, smiling, "Believe it or not, it’s up to you. However, I must warn you, that old badger from Longpan Mountain might have a change of heart and, once he meets up with the other celestial masters, he might come after you to capture you and serve you as a meal for that evil python."

The snow-white raccoon dog hesitated for a moment, then quickly tucked away the porcelain vial and shot off, only to turn back after running a few dozen steps, standing on her hind legs in a human-like bow to bid farewell.

The young man remained squatting in place, waving goodbye.

After the little creature departed, Chen Ping'an stood up and slowly walked towards Jingzhou City, considering it a stroll through the mountains at night.

Thinking about how he had just lost a Gu Yu coin, Chen Ping'an sighed repeatedly, reminding himself not to be so wasteful next time.

However, it seemed this account manager had forgotten that after he had given away a small summer coin at the butcher's shop, he also reminded himself similarly.

Chen Ping'an completely forgot about this and continued his walk while looking up at the bright moon in the sky, feeling unworldly. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 514: Report of Mr. Return (Part 1)

As the winter solstice approached, the days grew shorter and shadows longer, yet it marked the beginning of the revival of yang energy in the world.

On this day, emperors and monarchs across the countries of Baopingzhou would pay homage to the mountains. Even if they could not attend in person, they would send high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Rites to the mountain deity temples to burn incense.

Similar to Longquan County, the Mei You Kingdom also celebrated a minor New Year. Even in impoverished households, dumplings, lamb soup, or glutinous rice were prepared according to local customs.

Chen Ping'an and his two companions chewed on glutinous rice balls bought from the market as they made their way back from Jingzhou, the southernmost region of the Mei You Kingdom.

At a border checkpoint, Chen Ping'an halted his horse, allowing Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi to pass through first. He then rode alone toward a small hill. Upon reaching the top, an old cultivator approached leisurely. With a trace of unfamiliarity in his refined Baopingzhou dialect, he smiled and said, “You may not recognize me, but I am quite familiar with you.”

Chen Ping'an smiled back, “Thank you, senior, for your hard work in escorting me along the way.”

The old cultivator ignored the hint of sarcasm in Chen Ping'an's words; after all, no one enjoys being shadowed. He said, “I was once a cultivator of the Tongye Sect, so enduring this journey has indeed been quite tiresome.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “‘Was once’?”

The old man maintained his aura at the Golden Core Earth Immortal level, his skin shimmering with a light as if the sun and moon were revolving within him. He did not answer the question, instead scrutinizing the young man before him, trying to glean what allowed him to become a friend—or perhaps a junior brother—of that renowned sword immortal. It was difficult to say for now; any interpretation was possible. However, in this world, there were no benefits without cost, especially on the mountain. A single misstep could lead to total loss.

Standing atop the small hill, the old cultivator surveyed the surroundings. The scenery of the Mei You Kingdom seemed dull and uninteresting, the spiritual energy sparse, far inferior to Shujian Lake.

There were some secrets he held back from the young man. Currently, he was using his Yin spirit to travel here while his Yang spirit carried a specially made Tongye talisman meant to monitor him, concealing his true whereabouts to prevent this meeting from being detected by Shujian Lake. The risks he took were calculated and deliberate. The group of outsiders, seen as esteemed guests by the wild cultivator Liu Lao Cheng of Yupu Realm, were all chosen with care and sent to Shujian Lake; none were simple characters, and he was no exception.

Yet, in the Dao, one must see the price of loyalty.

He felt that the price was a bit low.

Even though he had been deemed hopeless in reaching the Fifth Stage by the Great Yin-Yang Family, he was still a seasoned Golden Core cultivator with two hundred years of life left. With sufficient expenditure to prolong his life, he might even survive for another three hundred years.

After receiving this secret mission, he pondered and felt it was a series of schemes involving using others as tools. That guide at the Fifth Stage was merely a knife for someone else, and he was, too. Unfortunately, Baopingzhou was not his home ground; he had no foundation here and no one to rely on. Otherwise, he might have found another knife, someone faster and perhaps a bit duller mentally, and he could have sought fortune amidst danger, potentially striking it rich. Of course, it was also possible he would be like a grasshopper on a shared string, and everyone would end up in trouble. As for the true puppet master, whose identity he could not even guess, they would remain carefree.

The old cultivator asked, “I have a mutually beneficial business proposal. Are you interested?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Please, go ahead.”

The old cultivator smiled, “But I need your promise first: for at least a hundred years, you, Chen Ping'an, cannot disclose our transaction to anyone.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Even if I agree, do you dare to trust me?”

The old cultivator nodded, “I don’t fully trust you, but I plan to take a gamble. My appearance here before you is already proof. In the world of cultivation, as long as one’s Dao is higher than mine, I cannot discern depth clearly. However, after spending so much time together, observing your character is not too difficult. I have seen many like you; most of them I met in their youth, and they often died early, perishing midway. Hence, I merely stated this is a hundred-year agreement.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “With the New Year approaching, could you say a few auspicious words?”

The old Golden Core cultivator smiled, “If I were to speak some flattery, would you not be suspicious? How could we conduct business then?”

Chen Ping'an admitted the old man was not wrong.

About a stick of incense later, Chen Ping'an rode down the hill. His already poor complexion had turned ashen, as if he had just survived a life-and-death ordeal. His frail body felt drained, almost empty.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, who were waiting with bated breath after crossing the checkpoint, were horrified, hardly daring to breathe. Moments earlier, the entire checkpoint had witnessed the radiant sword light where Chen Ping'an had vanished.

Waving his hand dismissively, Chen Ping'an reassured them, “It’s fine. I’ve settled things. Let’s continue our journey; there won’t be any further incidents. Remember the old rules: you won’t return with me to Shujian Lake.”

On the other side of the hill, the Golden Core cultivator had already dispelled his concealment technique, revealing himself as an ordinary-looking middle-aged woman. A drop of blood slowly seeped from her brow, which she gently wiped away with her fingertip. To any Fifth Stage cultivator, that small mark would be strikingly conspicuous.

She felt somewhat assured about doing business with that young man; after they had both resolved to engage in trade, they carefully examined the details, ensuring no loose ends were left. After several tests, the young man had handled everything adeptly.

Looking towards the sky, she performed a bow of respect, her tone both reverent and fearful, trembling as she spoke, “Li Fuju is unrefined and incompetent, only daring to offend gentlemen, not the unscrupulous. I apologize for any rudeness.”

Moments passed in silence.

The woman laughed quietly, realizing she may have overthought things.

Currently, Baopingzhou was in turmoil, requiring the accompanying Saint to keep an eye on people and events. There were too many to list: Sky Monarch Xie Shi from the Northern Julu Continent, Prince Song Changjing of the Great Li, the Emperor of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, and so on. It certainly did not involve her or Chen Ping'an. Even Liu Zhimo, who was imprisoned in the depths of the water prison, had said that Chen Ping'an carried the holy token inscribed with “I nurture the righteous qi,” but regarding the accompanying Saint sitting under the sky of a continent, she was somewhat aware of the hidden truths. As long as there were no extraordinary killings on the ground, the saint would not shift their attention, merely casting a glance. However, if something as significant as the old master of Taiping Mountain personally pursued the Elder Monkey with a sword occurred, it would undoubtedly attract the immediate attention of the Tongye Sect’s saint.

But caution was key to navigating the treacherous waters.

Some rituals and courtesies were always better to have than to miss.

After leaving the Mei You Kingdom’s checkpoint and entering the territory of Shujian Lake, Chen Ping'an, near a rural village, turned back to look at his two disheartened companions. With a hoarse laugh, he said, “Sorry to worry you; I’ve just been lost in thought on this journey.”

Ma Duyi clutched his chest, “Mr. Chen, you’ve finally returned to your senses! You’ve either been dazed or frowning the entire way; we were nearly scared to death from worrying.”

Zeng Ye nodded vigorously.

Chen Ping'an gently reassured them, “I encountered a situation that I couldn’t quite figure out for a moment. I apologize for that.”

Ma Duyi asked with a smile, “Do you understand it now?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I still can’t grasp the reason behind it, but I’ve roughly figured out how to respond.”

Concerned, Ma Duyi pressed, “Are you really alright?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’m fine now.”

Ma Duyi hesitated, “Then, Mr. Chen, have a drink to show us you’re alright; otherwise, we won’t feel at ease.”

Zeng Ye’s face turned awkward.

Of course, Chen Ping'an didn’t actually take a drink, laughing, “You two should stay here; remember not to disturb the locals. Focus on your cultivation and motivate each other, don’t slack off. I’ll strive to rejoin you by the beginning of spring next year; perhaps even sooner. By then, we’ll head south of Shujian Lake, where the miasma is thick, and spirits roam the mountains and marshes. It’s said there are evil cultivators and demonic practitioners there, making it far more dangerous than in Shihou Kingdom and Mei You Kingdom. Don’t fall too far behind.” 

Ma Duyi snorted lightly.

Zeng Ye quickly promised to diligently cultivate.

Chen Ping'an rode away alone.

However, before departing, he handed over the golden demon-binding rope and several talismans to Ma Duyi, just in case. He also reminded them to hide the demon-binding rope well; if a wandering wild cultivator caught sight of it, it would spell disaster.

In matters of life and death, Ma Duyi did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent or make jokes, only assuring Mr. Chen that they would be extremely careful.

That night, Chen Ping'an lay under the stars in a desolate wilderness, the ominous energy thick in the air. He could almost be certain that vengeful spirits lingered nearby, yet oddly enough, nothing happened throughout the night. This puzzled him; he couldn’t reveal his true cultivation level now, and the other party was deeply concealed, likely connected to the local energies. Thus, he had to let it go.

He rode slowly onward.

His mind was heavy with worries.

According to the old Golden Core cultivator Li Fuju’s subtle hints, the one who sent her away from Gongliu Island was a Fifth Stage cultivator of the Tongye Sect, a person who once managed the sect's rules and regulations, holding a prestigious position. Even during Du Mao's time, he was a figure of considerable influence, one whom the current master of the Tongye Sect would address as ‘Shibo’ (master uncle).

This was not the most concerning matter for Chen Ping'an.

The truly terrifying part was that this old Tongye Sect cultivator was now a venerated figure at the Yuguizong, which was soon to establish a base in Shujian Lake in Baopingzhou!

Yuguizong appeared in the dusty medicine shop in Old Dragon City, represented by the elderly Xu, as well as in the future’s cultivation realm on the right side of the Sui dynasty, and even earlier, in the Qinghu Palace with Jiang Shangzhen.

Among them, Jiang Shangzhen was likely to be the first sect master in the history of Yuguizong’s subsidiary sect. However, there was still no concrete evidence from the ancestral hall of Yuguizong, so there remained uncertainties.

The fact that Jiang Shangzhen had yet to arrive at Baopingzhou was one of the pieces of evidence.

As for the chief venerator of the subsidiary sect, that was undoubtedly Liu Lao Cheng from Gongliu Island.

The old Golden Core cultivator Li Fuju had revealed all of this.

With the lively Jiang Shangzhen not making an appearance, it was instead the ambitious old ancestor of the Tongye Sect who had become the leading figure in establishing the Yuguizong. It was possible that this great cultivator had some justified ideas and intended to challenge Jiang Shangzhen for the position of the subsidiary sect’s master.

No wonder Li Fuju had been tracking him closely and seeking opportunities.

No wonder Su Gaoshan had shown him such disdain; after all, even Tan Yuanyi was aware of a portion of the Green Wave Pavilion’s archives, fully understanding his intricate ties with the Great Li. Su Gaoshan, who regarded Tan Yuanyi with utter disregard, would undoubtedly know even more. At Su Gaoshan's level, while he could not freely command spies from the Green Wave Pavilion, it wouldn’t be difficult to access the archives or learn more inside information than Tan Yuanyi.

Fortunately, Li Fuju was cautious and respectful enough to fear the unpredictable nature of the Dao.

She had performed a mutual sacrifice with him, each suffering losses.

Of course, they would meet again at some point beyond the border at a place near the checkpoint.

If the news of even a slight injury on the brow of an old Golden Core cultivator spread, no one across the thousands of islands outside Gongliu Island’s Shujian Lake would believe it.

However, as long as Liu Lao Cheng did not have a fixed intention to harm him and did not actively reveal his true identity—after all, revealing it would mean harming himself and others—he would need to maintain a delicate balance with a future top venerator of Yuguizong as an ally. As long as Liu Lao Cheng said nothing or was vague in his words, merely saying something harmless, the old ancestor of the Tongye Sect would be left with some skepticism, which would be sufficient.

However, atop the hill, Chen Ping'an still chose not to mention Liu Lao Cheng's message delivered via Liu Zhimo's flying sword. He did not think to leverage this opportunity to seek an alliance with Li Fuju, nor did he wish to express goodwill towards her without gaining anything in return.

Some things simply could not be done.

Otherwise, he would need to seriously reflect and weigh his conscience to determine if he had truly become a full-blown wild cultivator of Shujian Lake.

Whether it was Chen Ping'an or Li Fuju, they both remained oblivious that after they had left the checkpoint, a familiar figure, one they both recognized, appeared faintly on the border city wall.

If Li Fuju knew of this, her heart would likely shatter.

Because this unexpected visitor was Liu Lao Cheng, the most formidable wild cultivator of Baopingzhou, who had only come into the limelight after obtaining a fragment of the Glazed Golden Body that even Daoist Qizhen coveted, now poised to step into the realm of immortality.

He had left Shujian Lake to negotiate important matters with Su Gaoshan. He had certainly done so, but how he would return to Gongliu Island and when remained under no one’s control.

Even the Fifth Stage cultivator, who had switched from the Tongye Sect to the Yuguizong and casually stolen a treasure from the ancestral hall, dared not impose strict constraints on Liu Lao Cheng, let alone recklessly probe him repeatedly.

Fifth Stage wild cultivators were incredibly difficult to deal with, even in the much vaster Tongye Continent compared to Baopingzhou.

Regardless of why Liu Lao Cheng had appeared there, he waved his sleeves, retracting his near-immortal-level control of the mountains and rivers, and as a mountain and marsh wild cultivator, he certainly possessed a few exceptionally powerful hidden techniques or treasures, capable of incredible lethality while remaining extremely concealed. He had tools to protect his Yin and Yang spirits, escape, and spy, making sure he was well-equipped for survival, ensuring a long life for himself.

Li Fuju soared into the sky, transforming into a rainbow as she flew away, the air above the checkpoint rumbling like winter thunder.

Once Liu Lao Cheng appeared, he smiled and said, “Good lad, still upholding some chivalry; I’ll give you that. Otherwise… hehe.”

Liu Lao Cheng vanished swiftly.

In such life-and-death situations, even after traversing the treacherous paths, Chen Ping'an remained utterly unaware.

Such is the nature of the world; often, it isn’t about life and death. Instead, it transforms into lighter matters, such as inexplicable opportunities, sudden misfortunes, unwarranted disputes, or unexpected strokes of fortune. Each incident leaves people bewildered or ecstatically joyful or filled with lament. 

It seems that all events are preordained yet are ultimately contingent upon human actions.

People act, and heaven observes; even if heaven does not watch, others do.

As for what one should do, each person has their own paths, defined by the choices they make in their circumstances. Treating others with sincerity, seeking profit, or taking it easy can all be foundations for survival. The only foolish part lies in the fact that this simple truth often eludes many, and even when known, it remains useless, comforting oneself with the belief that the world is as it is, and reason is futile. 

After all, each person arrives at their current situation supported by underlying logic beyond mere words. The fundamental thoughts and frameworks of each person are like critical pillars; changing them is not easy, akin to repairing a dilapidated house by adding bricks and tiles, which costs money. If the pillars are unstable, the house will surely collapse. 

It may be acceptable to merely consider replacing roof tiles or patching windows, but attempting to change the pillars? That is akin to injuring oneself and seeking suffering, a challenging feat few can accomplish. The older one gets, the more accustomed they become to their current dwelling, making it increasingly difficult to effect change. When calamity strikes and one finds themselves in dire straits, it is better to reflect on the state of the world, recognizing that everyone is in this together. Then, borrowing a few sayings from books on how to navigate life for temporary comfort, or observing the greater misfortunes of others, becomes a natural thought process.

As Chen Ping'an approached Shujian Lake, he suddenly turned his horse around and galloped back toward the Mei You Kingdom.

This was not to reunite with Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, but to leave his mount behind, letting it roam free in the mountains. Whether they would meet again in the future would depend on fate.

Chen Ping'an took a remote path only accessible to woodcutters, hiking over the mountain border in search of someone.

A young monk capable of taming the restless mind.

Upon reaching a cliff, Chen Ping'an stopped, clasped his hands together, and bowed toward a stone cave high above.

The young monk rose from his cushion without surprise, returning the gesture before extending a hand, indicating Chen Ping'an could climb up the sheer cliff.

Throughout his journey, Chen Ping'an had not sensed anyone following him. He had taken his time, slightly feigning that his breathing was less smooth than usual. As for his internal conditions, Li Fuju's unique secret technique helped conceal them, but he still needed to be cautious. Otherwise, he would endanger both Li Fuju and himself, putting himself in a perilous situation.

Like a monkey climbing the rocks, he ascended.

The young monk stood within the narrow stone cave, and once Chen Ping'an settled in, he sat cross-legged but offered the cushion to his guest.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment but ultimately sat on the cushion.

The restless mind remained with its eyes closed, seemingly in deep sleep.

The young monk spoke, “I come from Tongye Continent; your Baopingzhou dialect is not familiar to me. Regarding Buddhist principles, I know only the surface. There are two barriers in our communication: one is our language, and the other is the distance between the principles of Buddhism and the words of the sutras. Therefore, I dare not speak carelessly.”

Chen Ping'an smiled in the Tongye dialect, “That’s fine. I have traveled through Tongye Continent and can speak that dialect, which should break down a small barrier.”

The young, emaciated monk smiled slightly, “It’s good that you don’t know; it helps lessen the barriers in your mind.”

Chen Ping'an felt a surge of thoughts but suppressed them gently.

After all, subduing the restless mind was the young monk's path to enlightenment, and outsiders should not bring it up lightly, even if he wanted to ask about some uncertainties in his heart.

The young monk continued with a smile, “You are fated to encounter Buddhism, and we are also fated to meet. The former is visible to the naked eye, while the latter is vaguely perceived. I believe when you traveled in the northern part of Tongye Continent, you must have passed by a mountain peak and seen a seemingly mad little spirit, muttering incessantly, asking, ‘With such a heart, how does one become a Buddha?’ Is that correct?”

Chen Ping'an was stunned.

The young monk smiled slightly, “Indeed.”

Gazing beyond the stone cave, as if seeing thousands of miles beyond the continent, he said slowly, “You’ve asked the right question, but I cannot provide the answer.”

The young monk continued, “On my journey to seek the sutras, I was both master and disciple, unaware as I transformed into five. Deeply mired in my own delusions, I encountered a spirit cave that was benevolent towards others, kindly showing me the way. However, when I later faced turmoil, I ended up killing countless beings with a single strike. My quest for the sutras effectively ended there, severed again and again, never turning back. I still do not know; wandering through one continent after another, enduring countless hardships, having left this world, I finally glimpsed the Pure Land of Buddhism, yet I turned back, hand and heart empty.”

The young monk sighed, looking at Chen Ping'an, “Please, ask me.”

Chen Ping'an gradually voiced some of the questions that had been troubling him, both regarding the complexities of the sutras and confusions in life.

The young monk offered clarifications based on Buddhist teachings.

Chen Ping'an had only read a few of the Buddhist texts recommended by Cui Dongshan and had no understanding of the complex sects and lineages of Buddhism; furthermore, he was not particularly concerned about them. 

He listened with a sincere heart, eager to hear the answers from this traveling monk from Tongye Continent.

There were several points that left a deep impression on him, among which was the study of logic.

In a question-and-answer format, the young monk extended the discussion further. Some of his statements bore clear traces of Confucianism, Daoism, and various schools of thought, and the monk spoke of this without hesitation.

When Chen Ping'an ran out of questions, the young monk smiled and said, “Do not fear that asking about Buddhist principles will lead to a departure from Zen; this is a common misconception among people.”

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile.

He truly respected Buddhism but had no desire to become a monk.

Afterward, he shared his experiences at the Lotus Flower Blessed Land and particularly his conversations with the old monk there, recounting everything to the young monk.

The monk listened earnestly, occasionally understanding and softly chanting a Buddhist verse.

Finally, when Chen Ping'an stood up from the cushion and took a step back, he bowed once more to the young monk, “I have found resolution.”

The young monk also rose, bowed his head, and murmured, “As you come, so shall you go; Shen Xiu takes his seat.”

Chen Ping'an exited the stone cave and retraced his path down the mountain.

The young monk gazed at the cushion again, clasping his hands together and repeating the latter half of the phrase, “Shen Xiu takes his seat.”

Chen Ping'an did not grasp the deeper meaning behind this.

He recalled that in his hometown, there was indeed a high cliff inscribed with the words “Heaven Opens, Shen Xiu.” The first time he traversed there, having journeyed across mountains and waters, he had been unable to see clearly due to the mist. It was only later when Wei Ban took him traveling through the territory of the Northern Peaks that he finally laid eyes upon it. He had once thought that Master Ruan chose that peak as the foundation for his sect because it contained the character “Xiu” in the name of Miss Ruan.

Chen Ping'an returned to the border of the Mei You Kingdom and unexpectedly found his horse in the woods. Upon seeing him, it galloped over, showing great affection.

Chen Ping'an gently patted its back, jokingly saying, “I just realized we’ve both lost weight. You’re not too bad, still carrying some strength. I, on the other hand, am as frail as a twig; I could fall over with just a gust of wind.”

He mounted the horse and set off for Shujian Lake.

With his sword and knife at his waist, he carried a sword nurturing gourd.

Now, Chen Ping'an assumed that had he appeared like this back then, there would have been no menacing knock at the door during that fateful night at Ziyang Mansion.

No wonder the old swordsman left behind in that checkpoint felt the need to clarify, not all young swordsmen in green were sword immortals.

Chen Ping'an once again entered Shujian Lake through Lvtong City, where he left his horse at the inn. He also visited that shabby alley and bought four affordable and delicious meat buns from the shop. It was strange, though; the shop seemed much quieter compared to half a year ago, the young owner’s expression weary, often sighing.

As Chen Ping'an gnawed on a bun, he found the ferry and tidied it up, then set off back to Qingxia Island.

As the year-end approached, the current state of Shujian Lake was even bleaker than last year; it was worse than that bun shop. Last year, heavy snow had fallen three times in succession, and the spiritual energy in Shujian Lake had noticeably increased, even drawing in those indifferent to the New Year. However, this year was already in dire straits before it even ended. Along with Qingxia Island, over a thousand islands were required to contribute half of their fortunes to the Great Li iron cavalry under Su Gaoshan. Some islands affiliated with the Zhu Ying Dynasty, as well as Shihou Kingdom and Mei You Kingdom, were suffering tremendously, severely depleted in strength, and caught in a tight spot.

The most terrifying aspect was the alliance formed by Tan Yuanyi from Licu Island, Tian Hujun from Sulin Island, and venerator Yu Kuai, along with the ancestral masters of all islands possessing Earth Immortal cultivators, such as the Earth Immortal couple from Huangli Island. They united without any disputes, working exceptionally cooperatively, proactively drawing a line of encirclement around the four cities of Shujian Lake, including the city of Chi Shui, which served as “checkpoints.” They would capture any cultivator daring to abscond with island wealth and hand them over to the Great Li iron cavalry stationed there, including iron cavalry generals, a civil official, and two accompanying cultivators. The four of them stationed in the cities created a tight net, cornering tens of thousands of mountain and marsh wild cultivators, leaving them no way out. They could only grit their teeth and sacrifice their own fortunes, as boxes of divine money continuously flowed towards Chi Shui City. During this time, numerous troubles and conflicts arose; nearly a hundred wild cultivators died, including two Golden Core cultivators, before Shujian Lake finally fell silent, obediently bowing down.

It was said this was just the first round.

In the future, larger islands would receive permission from the Great Li iron cavalry to devour the smaller fish and shrimp, massively expanding their influence over the affiliated islands. Within a year, the more than a thousand islands in Shujian Lake were likely to see a reduction of thirty percent of their ancestral halls, cutting off their lineage and completely becoming vassals of the large islands. In this inevitably bloody process, any cultivator daring to resist would only face a grim fate, as rumors spread that under Su Gaoshan’s command, a new position without rank would be established—horse-handling cultivators. This meant that those regular Great Li accompanying cultivators would have these horse-handlers as their attendants. Should Su Gaoshan break through the defenses of Mei You Kingdom, combined with Cao Ping's army, the two iron cavalry forces would encircle the Zhu Ying Dynasty in a massive siege. The only chance for the horse-handling cultivators was to gain military merit by engaging in battle against the Zhu Ying border forces, hoping to elevate themselves to the ranks of accompanying cultivators. However, whether ten horse-handling cultivators could survive to become accompanying cultivators was anyone's guess. Even if they succeeded, what would happen as the Great Li iron cavalry advanced south?

This rumor was credible, as it was easily substantiated; Su Gaoshan, the money-hungry barbarian of the Great Li, would indeed resort to such a scheme.

Yet, amid the current disarray in the hearts of the people, the larger forces had already begun to fragment. Who would dare to be the first to rise up?

At this moment, the wild cultivators of Shujian Lake were reminiscing about Liu Zhimo, whom they had once feared would reach the Fifth Stage. Now, they could only lament that Liu Zhimo had not focused enough on his cultivation; otherwise, he would not have ended up as a prisoner on Gongliu Island, unable to defend Shujian Lake.

Chen Ping'an stepped onto Qingxia Island and first sat in the mountain gate house for a while, noticing there was no dust. He quickly felt relieved; it must have been cleaned by Gu Can.

Though it seemed to violate their agreement, it was, in fact, a good thing.

Chen Ping'an exited the house and glanced at the lake view.

He had to pass through several islands along the way, and those with intentions had likely already learned of the news.

However, things were different now; there were no visiting guests. In fact, the last time Chen Ping'an returned to Shujian Lake from Shihou Kingdom, this solitude had already begun.

Yu Kuai, the island lord of Purple Bamboo Island, Liu Chongrun of Zhu Chai Island, and numerous other island lords had visited one after another, creating a lively atmosphere as if Chen Ping'an were the lord of the lakes and rivers.

Fortune has distant relatives in the mountains but no one cares in the bustling city.

That has always been the case.

Chen Ping'an cherished the tranquility and still decided to linger a moment longer at the ruins of Hengbo Mansion. The more he observed, the more he could appreciate the dangers of cultivating on the mountain.

Soon, Gu Can arrived at the site of Hengbo Mansion, standing beside Chen Ping'an. “I thought you wouldn’t return until after the New Year.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “I’ll be heading to the mountains south of Shujian Lake next, which may take a bit longer.”

Gu Can nodded.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Has Tian Hujun been looking for you?”

Gu Can replied, “Yes, she came looking for me, speaking quite sincerely. She advised me to lower my profile and suggested that since I hail from Longquan County, it could be a considerable advantage. She suggested I seek out a relatively young accompanying cultivator stationed at Chi Shui City. She claimed that someone of such youth, stationed there, must have a significant background, and that building a relationship with this person could lead to a stable position. However, I don’t completely trust her. She’s been getting close to Han Jingling and Huang He recently.”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and said, “Her reasoning for advising you to go to Chi Shui City isn’t a deception, but it doesn’t necessarily lead to the outcome she expects. You’re not wrong for not agreeing to seek out that influential Great Li accompanying cultivator. After all, you have no way of knowing that this so-called influential cultivator’s character, whether they might have already set a trap for you alongside Han Jingling and Huang He. I can’t say for certain, but I can offer some common sense. If that young cultivator truly is from a prominent family but chose to enlist as a battlefield accompanying cultivator, it suggests they are not only proud and unwilling to rely on their family but are also likely to be familiar with the intricacies of officialdom. They would not readily accept your past actions in Shujian Lake, even if they understood them. So, I’m not saying that not going to Chi Shui City is definitely the right choice, but it certainly isn’t a mistake.”

Gu Can turned to look at Chen Ping'an and asked with a smile, “How do you understand all this?”

Chen Ping'an pointed to his eyes and then to his head, “By observing more and thinking more, I can make fewer mistakes and always be prepared to correct them. In matters of life and death, it’s wise to leave some leeway and retreat. One should never narrow their paths too much; otherwise, one might suddenly find themselves in a dead-end.”

Gu Can squatted down, picked up a piece of rubble, and casually tossed it aside, “Don’t they say it’s better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “That’s true when there’s no choice. You need to first clarify what it means to truly have no choice and why one would end up in such a situation. Then, consider whether it’s possible that the heavens do not entirely close off human paths; options may still exist.”

Chen Ping'an also squatted down, picked up a piece of that green glazed tile, which was deemed a transgression in the mundane world, and said, “You might find this a bit complex now because you haven’t yet built this framework. It feels troublesome and complicated. In reality, it’s not that difficult. It’s like walking among mountains and rivers; when you encounter a mountain, you pave a road; when you meet water, you build a bridge. As long as you know how to build roads and bridges, you’ll find that when faced with obstacles in life, those difficulties are not insurmountable. Of course, knowing how to build roads and bridges also means seeking out materials can be exhausting—choosing stones, chopping wood on the mountain, and if money runs out, you might even have to borrow from friends or humbly ask those you dislike for help. But once you cross the river and climb the mountain, you’ll realize it’s all worth it. Moreover, you may not succeed in the end, but only when that moment comes can you say, ‘I have no regrets,’ and then you can talk about the earlier saying of preferring to be shattered jade than intact tiles, which would then follow the natural order.”

Gu Can lowered his head and murmured, “You must have done just that in Shujian Lake.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Let me say something you might not want to hear: it was upon arriving at Qingxia Island and feeling disappointed in you that I realized our differences. It might be harsh, but it’s my heartfelt truth, so listen carefully. When we first stepped out of the Lizhu Cave Heaven, we were both terrified of this world, right?”

Gu Can nodded vigorously.

Chen Ping'an continued slowly, “However, we chose different paths. I carefully scrutinized this strange world, striving to understand the true intentions of those around me, learning from their strengths, and pondering how they became strong. As for you, you sought the easiest and least laborious shortcut. I can understand the hardships you faced in Qingxia Island and your desire to protect your mother, which I truly admire. However, some things cannot be considered merely because I am close to you and understand your suffering, that I can say, ‘Gu Can, you did nothing wrong.’ The matters of the world are clear-cut; don’t confuse right and wrong just because human hearts seem complex. Even worse, even if I say something more outrageous, even a bad person should know what they are and the rules they have broken. Such a bad person can truly wreak havoc for a thousand years. You don’t understand this, and in the past, you liked to pretend to understand.”

Gu Can sighed, complaining, “Isn’t it your fault for only coming back to Shujian Lake so late? If you had told me all this earlier, I would have listened!”

Chen Ping'an harbored no irritation; this was merely a child’s habitual stubbornness, reflecting a deeper acknowledgment in his heart. 

This was entirely different from their first meal together at the spring court and Gu Can's admission of “enjoying killing” that night.

Chen Ping'an ruffled Gu Can’s hair.

Gu Can hung his head.

Chen Ping'an said softly, “If your mother were to secretly tell you one day to deliberately orchestrate an assassination in the spring court, so that I would stay on Qingxia Island to act as a guardian for you both, don’t agree to her. It would be pointless. However, there’s no need to argue with her, as that would also be useless. Have you ever thought that the one who could genuinely change some of your mother’s beliefs might not be your father, but you?”

Gu Can looked up, shock on his face.

Chen Ping'an laughed, “What, has she already told you?”

Gu Can sighed, muttering, “I’m a bit scared of you now, Chen Ping'an.”

Chen Ping'an put down the piece of glazed tile in his hand and replied hoarsely, “That’s because back then, I hid many troubling matters well from you.”

Gu Can laughed, “Well, back then, I never thought about these things. I was always thinking about what you would buy for me. Every time you returned from the dragon kiln with copper coins to Mud Bottle Alley, it felt like New Year’s.”

“Oh, you really don’t care about money, huh?” Chen Ping'an shook his head, “If it were someone else, I might care, but not with you. Initially, I wanted to repay my kindness, but later, it just became a habit.”

Gu Can suddenly asked, “Have you considered that your friends might feel burdened?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “That’s a great question.”

Gu Can grinned.

Chen Ping'an raised his arm and drew a long line, saying earnestly, “First, our lives are generally much longer than ordinary people’s, so we should think long-term, focus on good people and good deeds, travel far and wide, and witness the mountains and rivers. On the journey of life, I, too, will encounter obstacles and things I can’t understand. In those moments, I will come to seek your help without feeling embarrassed. That’s why I told you before that good friendships are like aged wine; the longer you let it sit, the better it becomes.”

Chen Ping'an gently clenched his fist, “Secondly, Gu Can, have you ever thought that I’ve also encountered many people who make me feel ashamed? There are more than just one or two, even here in Shujian Lake, such as Su Xinzai and Zhou Guonian. Even setting aside my relationship with you, just meeting them makes me feel uneasy. How could there be such good... people, or spirits in this world?”

Chen Ping'an looked at Gu Can, observing the subtle changes in his expression and demeanor without holding back.

Gu Can met Chen Ping'an’s gaze, “Chen Ping'an, can I ask you a favor? Can you send my mother out of Shujian Lake? Perhaps back to Mud Bottle Alley or to my father’s side?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “And what about you?”

Gu Can said, “You mentioned before that both reasoning and unreasonable actions come at a cost. I understand the cost of being unreasonable; I want to try the cost of being reasonable, too. I’ll head south to the mountains with Zeng Ye, and you only need to help me send my mother away from Shujian Lake.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Alright.”

It was as if he had been waiting for this response for a long time.

With their hands in their sleeves, Gu Can and Chen Ping'an gazed at the ruins together.

Afterward, Gu Can returned to the spring court, speaking not a word about the new agreement with Chen Ping'an, nor about his mother, only offering her comforting words.

Meanwhile, Chen Ping'an visited Chi Shui City.

He sought out that Great Li placidness token, unable to see Su Gaoshan but still meeting a sufficiently weighty accompanying cultivator.

Once inside the heavily guarded Fan residence, he found himself face-to-face with that young cultivator, both of them staring at each other.

Guan Yiran.

Chen Ping'an.

Where in life do we not meet again?

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 515: Reporting Mr. Return (Part 2)

Guan Yiran was very polite, warm, and sincere. However, when Chen Pingan mentioned sending Gu Can's mother from Qingxia Island to Longquan County, Guan Yiran did not immediately agree. Instead, he handled it in a businesslike manner, stating that the matter could be significant or trivial. He could not make a decision on his own and needed to report it to General Su Gaoshan.

Chen Pingan naturally had no objections. This was the proper way to conduct business. Blurring the lines between personal favors and official duties may seem like a shortcut, making social interactions incredibly smooth, but it leaves behind hidden troubles on the path of life, which might come back to haunt one on an unfortunate day.

Guan Yiran said that within a period of ten days, at most two weeks, the general would provide a response, and he would inform Chen Pingan as soon as he received it, regardless of whether it was good or bad.

After discussing official matters, the two shared a drink, with Chen Pingan treating. Just like last time at the city gate of Shihai Nation, Guan Yiran had joked that everything could be renegotiated, but he should never owe Guan Yiran a drink.

Although Guan Yiran is the direct descendant of the Guan family, a pillar of the Great Li, as Chen Pingan had previously guessed, ambitious officials often place great importance on rules. If it were Gu Can who had come here, Guan Yiran might have turned her away without hesitation. Moreover, the likes of Huang He had indeed been whispering in Guan Yiran's ear lately. Their intentions were sinister, but Guan Yiran saw through it easily. After all, the Guan family had been a cornerstone of the Great Li's officialdom for two hundred years. He had seen too many of these tricks; he might even think that Huang He and his ilk were not clever enough. Even if they could use Gu Can for short-term gains, they could forget about making any connections on Guan Yiran's side. Huang He might have considered the pros and cons, but the immediate benefits were too tempting to ignore, and he likely could not imagine how deep Guan Yiran's family background was—something Guan Yiran had never disclosed to outsiders.

However, this internal matter was like how Chen Pingan had not revealed Liu Lao Cheng's warning to Li Fuqu—no matter how much he felt a connection with Chen Pingan, Guan Yiran would not bring up Huang He and the likes of Tian Hujun as casual conversation topics over drinks.

After ten days had passed, a flying sword from Chishui City conveyed a message to Qingxia Island. Guan Yiran informed Chen Pingan that General Su Gaoshan had personally consented to allow Gu Can's mother to return to Longquan County on a celestial ferry. However, she was not permitted to carry too much immortal money or treasures from the secret vault of Qingxia Island. In exchange, Chen Pingan had to return the Great Li's peace token and report to the Ministry of Rites, effectively losing the protection that came with being a top-tier cultivator in Great Li. If he wanted to obtain another one in the future, he would have to rely on his merits.

Chen Pingan agreed without hesitation. 

Upon hearing this news in the Spring Courtyard, the woman reacted as if struck by lightning, as if she had received terrible news. After calming herself down a bit and seeing that both Chen Pingan and Gu Can were taciturn, she seemed to resign herself to fate and asked Chen Pingan what they would do about Gu Can, insisting that if Gu Can did not leave Shujian Lake with her, she would never leave Qingxia Island.

Gu Can looked at Chen Pingan. 

Chen Pingan said, “You can leave together. I can go to the mountains south of Shujian Lake by myself.” 

Gu Can asked, “Is my mother going to be safe returning to Nipin Lane?” 

Chen Pingan nodded, saying, “Whether it's Su Gaoshan or Guan Yiran, as long as they agree, they can be trusted. If you really are worried, I hope you can accompany your mother back. Some things, as long as you sincerely want to do them, can still be done.” 

Gu Can fell into deep thought. 

The woman timidly asked, “Will we be able to come back in the future?” 

Chen Pingan replied, “There is that possibility, but I can't guarantee anything right now.” 

Afterward, the woman asked about many details of their return journey, and Chen Pingan answered one by one, clearly anticipating everything she thought of, even things she hadn’t considered. 

This eased the woman’s heart, which had felt like it was being cut by a knife. They could take some of the Spring Courtyard's savings, such as a pile of immortal money, and select five or six maids from the household, as well as a few boxes of calligraphy and antiques. They could also choose ten spiritual artifacts and a treasure from the secret vault of Qingxia Island.

Afterward, the woman seemed to be like an ant moving house, filled with determination and radiating a glow reminiscent of when she used to gather mud in Nipin Lane to support her family. 

Chen Pingan had long since stopped caring about these matters; Gu Can had always been by her side. 

Eventually, Gu Can found Chen Pingan at the mountain gate and said she intended to accompany her mother on this journey; otherwise, she wouldn't feel at ease. 

Chen Pingan smiled and agreed. 

The two of them sat on the small bamboo chair that Chen Pingan had crafted, basking in the warm winter sunlight. 

Gu Can asked, “Aren't you afraid I might not come back?” 

Chen Pingan shook his head, “The worst things I feared have already happened and been faced. It’s hard to be disappointed again.” 

Gu Can, holding the charcoal oven that Chen Pingan had given her, said, “I'm sorry.” 

Chen Pingan laughed, “It's the same for me. I anticipated the worst and told you before that I had a ten-year agreement with a girl. If I truly had to waste so many years at Shujian Lake, I would leave for a time, travel to the Upside-Down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, meet her, explain everything, and then return to Shujian Lake. What did you say? Go ahead; as long as you will really come back, whether it's ten or a hundred years later, it doesn't matter if it’s a little late.” 

Chen Pingan turned his head, “But I’ll say this in advance: if you come back late, it’s better not to come back at all.” 

Gu Can nodded, “I won’t. Just trust me this once.” 

Chen Pingan nodded. 

At the end of the year, not a single snow fell at Shujian Lake. 

One day, Tian Hujun from Sulin Island personally had someone dock a Qingxia Island boat at the ferry. The woman took six of her most beloved maids and their many boxes aboard the boat. 

Chen Pingan stood at the bow of the boat with Gu Can. 

Tian Hujun, aside from initially greeting them, did not show up again. It was unclear whether it was due to careful consideration or feelings of guilt; in any case, he did not appear. 

Gu Can quietly asked, “You must have spent a lot for this.” 

Chen Pingan held the charcoal oven for warmth, “In the past, during the late nights helping your family with water disputes, I did it many times. Even after becoming a kiln worker, I returned to help your family with farm work whenever I had time. The gossip that spread was so harsh that it almost crushed me back then. That kind of discomfort is not any better than now, and it might even be worse. It would have made me feel trapped, as if I couldn’t help or not help, either way, it was wrong.” 

Gu Can had never cared much about the gossip from those meddling women. She lightly bumped Chen Pingan with her shoulder, “Chen Pingan, let me tell you a secret: back then, I always thought that if you really became my father, it wouldn't be so bad. If it were another man who dared to enter my home, I would have thrown urine into his rice bowl and dung into his pantry.” 

Chen Pingan instantly darkened his face and slapped Gu Can on the head. 

Gu Can grinned, “It was a joke, don’t take it seriously.” 

Then she became somewhat melancholy, “Honestly, I have no impression of that father at all. I don’t even know what I’d say if I met him.” 

Chen Pingan sighed, “Take your time.” 

Upon arriving at Chishui City, Guan Yiran personally welcomed them and had a lively conversation with Chen Pingan after they disembarked, which surprised Tian Hujun, who had stayed in the cabin. 

As Gu Can and Chen Pingan prepared to part, she said, “Don’t worry, I will come back quickly. You might even leave Shujian Lake sooner than expected and then go do your own thing.” 

Chen Pingan nodded, watching them leave. In the square of Chishui City, a celestial ferry personally dispatched by Su Gaoshan was already docked, with a Golden Core cultivator stationed there, along with two accompanying cultivators.

Now, the entire northern part of Baopingzhou belonged to the Great Li. In fact, even without Golden Core Earth Immortals, the risks were minimal. 

The ferry slowly ascended. 

Chen Pingan withdrew his gaze, and Guan Yiran, standing beside him, smiled, “I had merely heard a bit about your affairs before, knowing that there was a peculiar bookkeeper at Qingxia Island. I hadn't paid much attention, but after realizing it was you, I recently gathered some reports from Liuxu Island and a few from Green Wave Pavilion, delving deeper into it. I have to say—it’s truly the most foolish method.” 

Chen Pingan laughed, “Polishing bricks to make mirrors, gathering snow as grain—what if it really works out?” 

Guan Yiran said, “But if it weren’t for this, I wouldn’t have had the courage to write a letter to the general, daring to urge them on. This isn’t about taking credit or boasting; frankly, I’m still terrified. You don’t know the temper of our general. My earliest squad leader from years ago is now a real power-holding general, and my current superior usually looks at us with disdain, like a father-in-law meeting his son-in-law—no matter how you look at it, it’s never pleasing. Yet when they meet the general, they all become as spineless as mice facing a cat, each one more sycophantic than the last. So I have to ask you for a couple of jars of wine to calm my nerves.” 

Chen Pingan laughed heartily and, together with Guan Yiran and his friends, shared a drink. The wine was on Chen Pingan, and these poor fellows could only ask the Fan family for a few small dishes of appetizers. Because of the rules, even though they had gold and silver mountains, no one dared to indulge in lavish feasts; they could only take advantage of Guan Yiran’s generosity. 

After a hard-earned opportunity, they seized the chance to enjoy themselves. A young man named Yu Shan Fang, also a military cultivator, who had been at the same rank as Guan Yiran back in Shihai, now found himself as a subordinate. He complained, saying that Guan Yiran, this pretty boy, had simply been born into a good family, which left him quite disgruntled. Guan Yiran shook his head, grinning, and teased him, “If you’re not satisfied, why don’t you come and fight me?” 

Ultimately, Yu Shan Fang hesitated for a while before giving Guan Yiran a light punch on the shoulder, laughing as he switched from a fist to a palm, lightly brushing it off, saying Guan Yiran was too petty, not much of a killer, but certainly held grudges well. “I wouldn’t dare!” 

Watching their camaraderie, Chen Pingan simply smiled and drank. 

Then Guan Yiran recounted an amusing anecdote from Shihai Nation. In short, it was a story about their group’s misadventure. 

At that time, there had been an old scholar who had just moved his family from the capital to the county town. It was said his family once had a great background but had fallen on hard times for two generations and were now far from their former glory. Even the local officials in Shihai Nation didn’t take them seriously. This family adamantly refused to post the Great Li’s door gods. 

So a furious Yu Shan Fang personally led a group to their door, only to witness an unforgettable scene. 

While recounting it, Yu Shan Fang still felt a sense of regret and took a hearty swig of wine. 

On that day, an elderly man, nearly blind, sat upright in the great hall, wearing an old, almost grayish-blue robe, all alone there. 

He could no longer see the Great Li soldiers clearly, but the clang of armor and the sound of their footsteps were enough to instill fear in even the county lord of Shihai Nation. 

Yet Yu Shan Fang and over ten elite soldiers from the Great Li never anticipated that before they could even speak, the old scholar sneered in the most articulate Great Li dialect, “Is this how Cui Zhan teaches you to conquer the world? Is this how Qi Jingchun teaches you reason? What a formidable Great Li cavalry! What a Great Li that has listened to a hundred years of scholarly sounds from the Cliff Academy!” 

The Confucian-clothed old man slammed his palm on the table, straining to widen his eyes, glaring at the armored elite soldiers, “I want to see how long this dogshit Great Li can frolic about!” 

The old man stood up and pointed at the group of heavily armored elite soldiers, cursing them out. 

Yu Shan Fang felt utterly humiliated, yet in the end, not a single soldier drew a sword, nor did anyone utter a harsh word. 

They left that estate quietly and forbade anyone from disturbing it. 

When Guan Yiran learned of this, he personally wrote to Su Gaoshan, asking if an exception could be made to allow this family to avoid posting the Great Li door gods. 

Guan Yiran actually thought the possibility was slim; after all, the rules of Great Li were iron-clad, and no one dared to overstep. 

Yet Su Gaoshan sent back a letter scolding Guan Yiran fiercely, saying that Shihai Nation was now under the Great Li's jurisdiction. For such a scholar not to be respected, should they instead respect Han Jingling that son of a turtle or the Huang family’s useless lot? So it was settled that the old scholar would not have to post the Great Li door gods. If the national master held him accountable, Su Gaoshan would take full responsibility. Even if it reached the prince's ears, he would still do it. Guan Yiran, if you’re brave enough, and ever find yourself on the receiving end of the national master’s resentment, remember to speak well of me to your great-grandfather and perhaps to the national master as well; maybe it would help ease his anger. 

Chen Pingan listened quietly. 

Finally, Guan Yiran leaned back in his chair and looked at Chen Pingan, saying, “I think there should be more scholars like that. What do you think, Chen Pingan?” 

Chen Pingan nodded, “The more, the better.” 

Guan Yiran squinted and smiled, raising his wine bowl, “Here, you and I can count as half a scholar, while Yu Shan Fang and these rough men know nothing. Come on, let’s have a drink.” 

Chen Pingan smiled as he raised his wine bowl to clink with Guan Yiran’s, without any concern for the inequality in their vessels, “Then let’s drink.” 

Yu Shan Fang spat, rallying the rest of his companions, declaring loudly, “We, the border heroes, will have our own drink and not bother with these pretentious scholars.” 

With that, they also clinked their bowls together, the sound crisp and clear. 

In the end, they all drank until they were somewhat tipsy. After Guan Yiran personally sent Chen Pingan to the entrance of the estate, the winter night's cold wind blew, and his eyes cleared a bit as he lightly reminded, “Regarding the overall situation at Shujian Lake, at least for the near future, do not get involved. Since even I cannot access certain files about you, I won’t hide it from you; I have sent a flying sword to my family in the capital for information, and the reply was quite vague, filled with mysteries. So I know what that means. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but…” 

Chen Pingan nodded, joking, “It seems you didn’t drink enough, otherwise, you wouldn’t have said all this. Besides the first sentence, there was no need for the rest.” 

Guan Yiran clapped Chen Pingan’s shoulder, “Good fellow, you said it yourself, that makes you owe me another drink.” 

Chen Pingan laughed, “Once the situation is settled, I’ll treat you to a celebratory drink for your promotion then.” 

Guan Yiran nodded with a smile. 

Everything was left unspoken. 

If Chen Pingan were to frequently visit afterward, Guan Yiran would welcome it. However, that would involve many taboos in the officialdom, leaving both parties with some aftermath. 

But such thoughts, Guan Yiran could only keep to himself. Since he had recognized Chen Pingan as a friend, he would have to pay this little price. Otherwise, would he really just be a wine lover, coveting Chen Pingan's hidden stock of wine? Would he, the future master of the Guan family, a pillar of the Great Li’s court, really be lacking in this? What he lacked was merely a friend he recognized. 

However, since Chen Pingan could understand this matter from the very first sentence he said, using “the situation is settled,” Guan Yiran was even happier. 

True friends must drink heartily together, but life is full of disappointments, and there are always unpleasant matters at hand. If friends can understand and consider each other, that is truly the best; without a bowl in hand, they make one feel as if drinking fine wine. 

The young man in the cotton blue robe walked slowly down the quiet and desolate street. 

Guan Yiran looked at the thin figure and remembered that hollowed-out face. 

For no reason, he felt a pang of sadness, but he also felt that the friend was somewhat carefree. 

Perhaps a true swordsman would be like this—drinking freely at the feast, yet still walking the path alone after the banquet. 

Guan Yiran had drunk with many people and had invited many to drink. 

However, there was once a notoriously infamous Golden Core cultivator of the Great Li, who was a lofty immortal. When he returned from the border that year, this immortal personally appeared, seeking out Guan Yiran on Chi’er Street, wanting to invite him for drinks to discuss a few matters. 

Guan Yiran jokingly asked, “Do you deserve it?” 

At that moment, everyone around thought Guan Yiran might have gotten drunk and would definitely stir up some trouble, even the Guan family might have to endure a penalty drink. 

When he returned to his family estate in Yichi Lane afterward, his great-grandfather laughed heartily, patting the young man’s shoulder. 

That was the second time Guan Yiran had seen his great-grandfather so happy; the first was when he decided to enlist and go to the border as the lowest-ranking scout cultivator. 

Some people always believe that identity and status determine whether one can sit at certain tables. 

These people, even if they got lucky and managed to sit at a table, would only bow and scrape, proactively toast again and again, lowering their cups lower and lower, almost groveling on the ground to drink. 

Truly amusing and laughable. 

Guan Yiran hugged his head with both hands, grinning, “Every family has its own difficulties. We must understand these people; after all, some are compelled by life and have no choice but to do so. However, more often than not, they sharpen their wits, using upbringing, family traditions, and spirit to exchange for real silver. Among them, there will be those who rise high. However, at least at my table, they shouldn’t even think about drinking. To minimize interactions with these people in the future, I also need to work harder; otherwise, if the day comes when I have to toast them, wouldn’t that be the end? In that case, not only would I suffer, but the entire Guan family and all those friends I’ve drunk with would suffer as well.” 

Having already left Chishui City, Chen Pingan could never have guessed how much and how far Guan Yiran was thinking. 

After returning to the ferry, he found that the Qingxia Island ferry was still waiting. 

This was to be expected. 

An identity shrouded in clouds yet sufficiently intimidating, Guan Yiran was enough to make Tian Hujun and the others reconsider the situation. 

Perhaps even Huang He, upon hearing this, would abandon the idea of inviting him for drinks, as there was no way to maintain their pretensions. 

After boarding the ship, Tian Hujun, with a face full of guilt, said, “I could only watch my junior brother and aunt leave the Spring Courtyard, and I’m very sorry.” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “Human power is limited; just do your best.” 

Tian Hujun looked at Chen Pingan’s face, particularly noting the gaze of that bookkeeper. He found no trace of mockery, but still felt unsettled. After all, Master Liu Zhimo had almost no chance of making a comeback, and her actions, though sincere for herself and Sulin Island, had no heart for her master and junior brother. 

Chen Pingan had already shifted the topic, “What will be done with the Spring Courtyard?” 

Tian Hujun smiled, “As long as Mr. Chen is willing, you can move in at any time.” 

Chen Pingan waved his hand, “No need, I’ve gotten used to my old place.” 

Tian Hujun had nothing more to say. 

The Spring Courtyard was the second most spiritually enriched place after Hengbo Mansion on Qingxia Island. With the woman moving out, almost all the top servants, including Yu Huai, began to covet it. As for Hengbo Mansion, everyone wanted to acquire it, but no one had the means to do so. Even Tian Hujun, the current decision-maker of Qingxia Island, did not think she could rebuild Hengbo Mansion, let alone take the lead. 

Was she seeking death? 

As for the Spring Courtyard, Tian Hujun would definitely reclaim it. Suggesting that Chen Pingan move was merely a polite gesture, knowing full well that he would not agree. 

Dealing with intelligent people, especially those who abide by rules, is much easier. 

If it weren’t for Chen Pingan suddenly having a friend named Guan Yiran, Tian Hujun might still have anchored the ship at the ferry but would not have personally welcomed or stayed here to accompany a bookkeeper doomed to fail, wasting her breath. 

Tian Hujun accompanied Chen Pingan in silence for a moment before taking her leave. 

Chen Pingan held the charcoal oven, smiling and nodding. 

Tian Hujun looked at the smile of the haggard man and felt a slight ripple in her heart but did not ponder deeply. 

Chen Pingan, with his back to Tian Hujun, gazed out at the lake, lost in thought. 

Yuguizong. 

Under the dim light, he truly hadn’t expected this. 

If it were Yuguizong, then it involved that previously unfathomable struggle for the Dao, indeed just the right measure. 

However, the twists and turns behind this were still hidden behind layers of curtains. 

Thus, Guan Yiran’s reminder as an observer was something Chen Pingan recognized. 

Yet, this also meant that many plans would have to wait and see how things unfold. Perhaps waiting would lead to an unresolved conclusion. 

For example, establishing some new rules for Shujian Lake, like occupying an island there, specifically for the spirits of the dead, creating a mountain sect that was peaceful and had self-defense capabilities. 

Chen Pingan actually thought of many things, but since the world was unpredictable, he could only adapt to the situation. 

The ups and downs of this matter, the gains and losses, were not for outsiders to discuss. 

Many things could only be kept silent. 

Returning to Qingxia Island, Chen Pingan went back to his room, stoked the charcoal furnace to add warmth to the entire place. The charcoal in his bag was already dwindling, and Chen Pingan chuckled at himself. If it weren’t for Guan Yiran’s appearance, he would have likely had to request charcoal from Qingxia Island, though they would certainly provide it. But now, he should expect someone to come asking tomorrow whether Mr. Chen needed more charcoal for his room. Starting tomorrow, he should also expect to see more familiar faces visiting. 

Chen Pingan sat down at the desk and continued to tally accounts. 

He hadn’t slept all night. 

When morning came, Chen Pingan opened the door and took a walk to Zhuxian Mansion. He wondered if in the wake of his decline, would the chattering of the maids in the Spring Courtyard, such as Hong Su, still be present or perhaps even worsen? But it didn’t matter; things were different now. After several rounds, the Spring Courtyard should have learned its lesson regarding Hong Su’s days; they should not be too difficult. 

The ghost cultivator Ma Yuan Zhi at Zhuxian Mansion, upon seeing Chen Pingan's increasingly ghostly demeanor, was particularly delighted; it was unavoidable. In this matter, ghost cultivators truly couldn’t afford to be kind, especially concerning his marriage to Princess Liu Chongrun. He had to be cautious around a young man like Chen Pingan, lest one day he not receive his wedding wine but instead get an invitation to Chen Pingan and Liu Chongrun’s wedding. 

Chen Pingan chatted casually with Ma Yuan Zhi for a bit before leaving Zhuxian Mansion. 

Ma Yuan Zhi was all smiles, genuinely finding Chen Pingan pleasing to the eye, addressing him as Mr. Chen, never this sincere before. 

Chen Pingan found it amusing and had no desire to continue discussing with Ma Yuan Zhi. 

The new concierge at Zhuxian Mansion was a maid from the Spring Courtyard, who greeted Chen Pingan warmly. This was indeed the “place of rise” for Hong Su; she had only been able to have a leisurely position in the Spring Courtyard thanks to her association with Mr. Chen. Chen Pingan was polite to the girl, but that was about it. What more could they chat about? On such a large Qingxia Island, how many Hong Sus were there? Just one. 

As Chen Pingan had anticipated, several familiar faces came to Qingxia Island today to catch up with him. 

Chen Pingan now handled these encounters skillfully, no longer feeling awkward or unnatural in conversation as he had before. 

It was all through bits and pieces of experience. 

Chen Pingan did not spend the New Year on Qingxia Island; he set off from Shujian Lake, stopping far away at Gongliu Island, continuing his journey. 

He went to Lutong City, looking for a horse, but unfortunately, that baozi shop had already closed. He didn’t know if it was due to difficulties or for the New Year, but it would reopen after the Lantern Festival. 

Chen Pingan spent the New Year on the road. 

Enjoying a leisurely time. 

Not feeling bitter at all. 

Just right on the first day of the New Year, he found the long-awaited Zeng Ye and Ma Du Yi. 

After resting for a day, on the second day of the New Year, he set off, the three riders circling the borders around Shujian Lake, heading south. 

Finally, at a celestial ferry that had been docked for quite a while, Chen Pingan said he would wait for someone here. If he didn’t see them within ten days, they would continue their journey. 

Zeng Ye and Ma Du Yi, between their cultivation sessions, strolled around the celestial ferry, where shops were plentiful and goods were abundant. 

After browsing, Ma Du Yi said she could no longer look because the more she saw, the more it tugged at her heartstrings, making her feel too poor. 

Chen Pingan handed each of them a small red packet, saying it was a New Year gift. 

Zeng Ye hesitated to accept, refusing no matter what, while Ma Du Yi, who had no pretense with Chen Pingan, even asked if she could have Zeng Ye’s as well. 

Chen Pingan laughed, “You don’t mind the weight of silver, do you?” 

Ma Du Yi nodded eagerly. 

Chen Pingan naturally did not agree, pulling back the packet, “Sorry, I don’t mind the weight of silver either.” 

Zeng Ye burst into laughter, reveling in the moment, elbowing Ma Du Yi, who winced and grimaced. 

At the celestial ferry, they waited for nearly ten days. 

On this evening, a ferry actually dared to dock, but when the various cultivators saw the flag on the boat, they suddenly understood. 

Damn it, it was the battle flag of the Great Li barbarians. 

Chen Pingan led that person back to the inn, while Zeng Ye and Ma Du Yi wore awkward expressions. 

Because it was Gu Can. 

Zeng Ye was purely afraid of Gu Can. 

Ma Du Yi was worried because Gu Can’s appearance at this time was really not a good sign. 

Many of the lingering wishes of ghosts and spirits could originally be fulfilled by Mr. Chen, but upon seeing Gu Can, they were likely to regret it instantly, or even become more enraged, and many spirits could directly turn into totally mindless malevolent ghosts, wasting Mr. Chen’s talismans again. 

That night, Chen Pingan had Zeng Ye bring out the Underworld Yama Hall from the large chest and placed it on his desk. 

Only Gu Can was in the room. 

Zeng Ye and Ma Du Yi returned to their respective rooms, and then Ma Du Yi unexpectedly found Zeng Ye, and the two sat together silently. 

In the late hours of the night, Chen Pingan knocked gently on the door. 

Ma Du Yi quickly ran to open it, and Chen Pingan signaled for them to sit down. After he took a seat himself, he quietly said, “Don’t worry about me. Just think, no matter how difficult it gets, can it be worse than at the very beginning?” 

Zeng Ye replied with a sound of agreement. 

Ma Du Yi also nodded lightly. 

Chen Pingan smiled and asked, “Is it tiring to accompany someone like me?” 

Zeng Ye shook her head vigorously. 

Ma Du Yi rolled her eyes, “I’m exhausted in my heart.” 

Zeng Ye timidly asked, “Ma girl, how could you die?” 

Chen Pingan suppressed his laughter. 

Ma Du Yi, rare to have the upper hand against Zeng Ye, kicked her hard under the table. 

Chen Pingan put his hands in his sleeves, leaning back in the chair, closed his eyes, and softly said, “I’m just going to nap for a bit; you don’t need to mind me.” 

Before drifting off, Chen Pingan thought about whether the people he cared about back in his hometown were doing well. 

Apart from his hometown, Longquan County, how was the rest of the world? Was there still that other world and blessed land, and was everything still well in the new spring season? Were there still places where the willows were swaying, and spring was blooming? 

Chen Pingan slowly fell asleep. 

Some faint snoring could be heard. 

It seemed he was truly tired. 

Zeng Ye had initially thought that the girl, who most loved to poke fun at Chen Pingan, would tease him. 

However, when the tall youth turned to look, he found that Ma Du Yi was sniffling, tears brimming in her eyes. 

The youth was puzzled; Chen Pingan was merely sleeping with a bit of snoring, why was Ma Du Yi so heartbroken? 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 516: The Return of the Master (Part Two)**

Longquan County.

At a small house in Mud Bottle Alley, the owner had yet to return from his travels. On New Year's Eve, new spring couplets, the character for 'blessing', and door gods had all been meticulously pasted up. Not only was there an enormous feast laid out on the table, but the cook was also a martial artist from the distant realms. An elderly man, who was adept at using chopsticks and had seen many years, was a former master who almost reached the Martial God realm, and there was a dashing young man clad in white— the North Peak Deity of the Great Li (Dali). 

Additionally, there was a female ghost residing in the remnants of a celestial being, who stubbornly occupied the host’s seat, claiming to sit in for her master. No one was allowed to dispute her position; the household had its rules, and with her master absent, she, as the first disciple, had to uphold them. 

Along with her was a young boy in a blue outfit squatting on a long bench and a well-behaved girl in a pink skirt standing by. 

After the New Year’s Eve dinner, the elderly man with the surname Cui left the house first. Wei Ban and Zhu Lian went out together to explore, casually strolling through the small town. 

Meanwhile, the three little ones huddled around the stove for the night watch. 

As dawn broke, firecrackers exploded outside the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley. 

The charcoal girl, with a sword and a knife at her waist, crossed her arms and nodded in satisfaction, showing approval of the festive atmosphere at her master's home. 

Pei Qian, adhering to her master's orders, didn’t spend the entire morning setting off firecrackers. Otherwise, with her temper, she would have woken up the entire town. 

Having restrained herself from the firecrackers, Pei Qian waved her big hand, exclaiming, “Let’s go fight!” 

The girl in the pink skirt didn’t join in the fun and opted to watch over the house. Shi Rou was even less inclined to indulge Pei Qian’s antics; after arriving in Longquan County, she had grown closer to the girl in the pink skirt. 

The boy in blue eagerly followed Pei Qian, relishing the chaos. 

After their first encounter with the stooped old man and the charcoal girl, the boy in blue felt that as a senior from the Fallen Mountain sect, he must maintain some dignity. Thus, he tried to suppress his natural exuberance, acting older than he was, which left the girl in pink feeling quite bewildered. 

Later, when he realized that the little charcoal girl didn’t understand a word he said, merely staring blankly with wide eyes, he let loose and played wildly with her, riding on the back of a black snake adorned with golden lines, climbing mountains and crossing valleys. 

Spending time with Pei Qian gradually eased the lingering feelings of melancholy and loss in the boy’s heart. 

As for Zhu Lian, upon meeting the elderly man with the surname Cui, he was respectful, but nothing more. 

In Pei Qian’s eyes, it seemed as if the old cook had lost his charm the moment he arrived in Longquan County. Instead, he got along famously with the dashing mountain deity, often visiting him at the Peak of Clouds. 

Pei Qian took the boy in blue on a tour through the streets and alleys, only to end up feeling disappointed. 

Not a single opponent dared to emerge for a duel. 

Pei Qian stomped her foot in frustration, “This is so boring!” 

The boy in blue chuckled, “What about that wild dog running around? Let’s go find it!” 

Pei Qian hesitated, “But it’s the first day of the New Year, isn’t that a bit inappropriate?” 

The boy in blue rubbed his chin, “You’re right. Let’s wait until tomorrow then?” 

Pei Qian nodded. 

The so-called “fighting” Pei Qian had in mind was actually a showdown with the large, arrogant white geese that roamed the small town, who were notorious bullies. 

Couldn’t they just share the wide alley without bothering each other? Did they not know that provoking a master would exact a painful price? 

During their first encounter, Pei Qian and her formidable foe had a battle of wits and courage. Eventually, she managed to seize one of the white geese by the neck, spinning it around several times while yelling, “Off you go!” 

Dazed and disoriented, the goose only became more emboldened, flapping its wings to attack again. Over time, Pei Qian found the trick to it, capturing it multiple times, collecting a pile of its snowy feathers, which she then fashioned into a shuttlecock using some copper coins. 

Before long, whenever those geese spotted the charcoal girl, they would deliberately take a detour. This made Pei Qian feel a bit lonely, but also somewhat pleased, as if she had tasted the bittersweet flavor of being a master. At such a young age, she had become so accomplished, truly living up to her master’s reputation and not embarrassing him in her hometown! 

Later, Pei Qian and the boy in blue encountered an exceptionally wild dog in the western mountains. 

What a find! 

Pei Qian was an ambitious girl, and one of her goals was to take on the wildest dog. 

Thus began a wild chase across the mountains. 

The boy in blue helped block its escape, reveling in the excitement. After that, the two troublemakers frequently sought out the mischievous dog to stir up trouble. 

Poor dog, who had been caught in this unforeseen calamity, found its protector absent from Longquan County, leaving it to flee with its tail tucked between its legs. Even when it escaped to the peaks of the Longquan Sword Sect, it couldn’t escape the chaos. The two little rogues charged right up the mountain, and upon seeing them, the disciples didn’t dare intervene. When Ruan Qiong spotted them, he only chuckled, showing no intention of stopping them, allowing the disciples to let those two mischievous kids run wild. 

Pei Qian, however, didn’t forget her manners. Holding her hiking staff, she saw Ruan Qiong and greeted him with a fist salute, exuding a sense of chivalry. 

To everyone’s surprise, the usually stoic Ruan Qiong smiled as he gently ruffled the little girl’s hair, saying that if she ever wished to join their sect to learn swordsmanship, she could do so, regardless of whether she officially registered. 

Pei Qian immediately declined, reaffirming her position as her master’s first disciple. 

She wasn’t particularly scared of the renowned sage, but rather felt a sense of kinship, harboring a little secret. 

Having seen the scenes from the river of time, she firmly remembered that blue-clad sister and thought to herself, “Even if being a master’s wife is difficult, being a second wife could work too!” 

Ruan Qiong laughed heartily, saying they could talk about it later, no rush. 

However, if he knew the little girl’s secret thoughts, he wouldn’t be laughing at all. He would likely scold that kid named Chen, who was truly a scoundrel, always trying to dig up the foundations of others. 

Pei Qian and the boy in blue arrived near Mud Bottle Alley when Pei Qian suddenly dashed to the now unchained iron well, crouching down to peek inside. 

The boy in blue squatted beside her and asked, “What are you doing?” 

Pei Qian whispered, “You all said there are many valuable things hidden in Longquan County. I want to see if there are any treasures inside. If there are, wouldn’t that make us rich?” 

The boy in blue rolled his eyes, “I advise you not to think about it. Other places might be fine, but this is now a private restricted area. Only because of my influence can you come here without anyone stopping you. Haven’t you noticed that no townsfolk come to draw water anymore?” 

Pei Qian was greatly disappointed, striking her palm in frustration, “What’s going on? I come to my master’s hometown, and I can’t find a single good thing?” 

The boy in blue scratched his head helplessly. 

Telling Pei Qian about chances and reasoning was futile; she didn’t care for the logic. However, when he casually mentioned luck, she suddenly took it to heart. 

It was truly like playing music to a cow; even the boy, who felt he had enough water in his head, couldn’t find a solution. 

The two sat at the well’s edge, and the boy in blue sighed. 

Pei Qian asked, “What’s wrong?” 

He rubbed his cheek, “I wonder how my brother, the River God of Yujiang, is doing nowadays.” 

Pei Qian responded, “What do you think? Without you, can he not live? I’m not saying you’re overthinking this; it’s just pointless.” 

The boy in blue rolled his eyes. 

Pei Qian crossed her arms, no longer concerned about the boy’s troubles, and lamented, “My master is really something; he still hasn’t returned after all this time.” 

The boy in blue nodded, “That unreliable old man still owes me several red envelopes.” 

Pei Qian hesitated, turned around, and pulled a few copper coins from the embroidered pouch given to her by Madame Gui of Old Long City, “Here, consider this your red envelope from my master. Is this enough?” 

The boy stared blankly at the few copper coins in her palm, suddenly filled with sorrow. He felt a surge of indignation but still reached out his hand to take them. A mosquito’s leg is still meat, after all. 

Pei Qian, however, just laughed heartily, clenching her fist to put the coins back in the pouch, “Dream on! I wouldn’t part with so much money.” 

Then Pei Qian’s laughter faded, and she patted the boy’s shoulder, “You’ve fallen to such a miserable state, and you’re still eyeing a few copper coins. You’re really not having it easy. It’s okay; my master said, ‘Hold on until the clouds clear and the moon shines.’ I’m passing this saying on to you. Am I being loyal?” 

The boy in blue began to wail in despair. 

How could one live a life like this? 

Pei Qian sighed again, truly feeling sorry for the boy, then took out those few copper coins and handed them to him, “Take them.” 

The boy’s face instantly lit up with joy. 

Pei Qian, shaking her head in exasperation, chastised, “Don’t get so greedy over money! You’re really lacking ambition!” 

Another year of spring passed. 

A blue-clad woman and a white-clad young man did not travel back north with the large group but jumped off the ferry at Red Candle Town. 

Then, the two walked back to Longquan County. 

In a bookstore in Red Candle Town, Cui Dongshan was feeling restless and found an excuse to tease a group of customers. 

One person got so riled up that he couldn’t care less about the charming girl standing next to the handsome young man and shouted, “What’s wrong with being envious of others living well? And should I not be happy when others are unhappy? Who are you to tell me what to do?” 

Cui Dongshan replied with a grin, “Alright, alright, that’s a good habit. Don’t change it! I’m not your parents; why should I try to change your habits?” 

Ruan Xiu neither found it boring nor amusing. 

Seeing her take out her embroidered handkerchief and start munching on pastries, Cui Dongshan quickly led her away, whispering in complaint, “Could you not eat that in front of me? The moment you take out pastries, I start to panic.” 

Ruan Xiu’s eyes lit up, “You know?” 

Cui Dongshan sighed, “I’m at least someone who almost reached the Ascending Realm. Though I’m in a bit of a dire situation now, my vision remains clear. I know exactly who you are.” 

Ruan Xiu smiled slightly. 

What to do when you crave the world’s finest delicacies but can’t indulge? She thought of a small trick: nibbling on something else is better than nothing. 

The two continued their journey, passing by Chess Hill. 

Stopping at the mountain’s peak, Cui Dongshan looked southward. 

The Emperor of the Great Li was, in fact, already a predecessor. 

This news was about to spread like wildfire, and soon it would be common knowledge among the people of Baopingzhou. 

Among the heirs of the Song family of the Great Li, the crown prince Song He was, of course, the most favored. That prince, who seemed to have fallen from the heavens, Song Mu, had no roots or foundation in the court. The Song family’s Ancestral Hall kept this matter tightly sealed; no one dared to spill a word, and those who showed even a hint of interest vanished without a trace. 

In recent years, several elders from the Ancestral Hall had not survived the sweltering heat and harsh cold, passing away “due to illness.” 

Following the “premature death” of His Majesty. 

The truth lay with three individuals: the demoted princess residing in Changchun Palace, who was the biological mother of two princes; the regent Prince Song Changjing; and the National Master Cui Zhan, who controlled the entire military of the Great Li. 

One held the legitimacy of bloodline and righteousness, while the other governed all military forces. The last one was the mastermind behind the century-long policies of the Great Li. 

The three maintained a delicate balance in the Great Li’s political sphere, both on the mountain and in the court. 

Before they conquered the Zhu Ying Dynasty, there would be no issues. 

After that— 

Big troubles would arise. 

That princess would undoubtedly exhaust herself, favoring Song He, who had grown up beside her, as he was effectively the old bastard’s disciple. 

Song He, or rather Song Jixin, was a disciple of Qi Jingchun. 

But the one who truly decided who would become the new emperor of the Great Li was only one: Prince Song Changjing. 

Even if he was not satisfied with being a regent and wanted to take the throne himself, the old bastard would agree. This was one of the many results calculated by the old “Embroidery Tiger.” 

However, for now, it seemed that Song Changjing was indeed uninterested in such ambitions; otherwise, he would have donned the dragon robe long ago. 

The mountain wind blew gently, carrying the fragrance of the spring grass and trees. 

Cui Dongshan squinted, feeling as though he had run into an unbelievable stroke of bad luck. 

With the intent of planting a flower, he found it wouldn’t bloom, while an unintentional willow bore shade, first at the Dazui Mountain Cliff Academy, where he casually discussed the intricacies of the pulse, nearly falling into the clutches of that detestable bull’s nose. 

Cui Dongshan slapped himself hard. 

Then there was that old man Yao’s deep-seated schemes, which were undoubtedly tied to old man Yang, resulting in a tangled web of connections. 

Cui Dongshan slapped himself again. 

To this, Ruan Xiu was already accustomed. 

Cui Dongshan glanced at the mountain cliff, pondering that it was best to let it go; jumping down wouldn’t kill anyone, but it would be embarrassing. 

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan began to rant, “Old bastard! Losing is losing, my teacher and I both admit it! But you should not deceive yourself, speaking of some ‘gentleman’s contest’! Qi Jingchun is dead, my teacher lost so miserably at Shujian Lake, not only leaving empty-handed but also sustaining huge losses! You’re playing chess with a dead man, speaking of your grand noble contest! Get out here so I can slap you twice and see if your dog mouth can spit out ivory…” 

Ruan Xiu squinted and smiled. 

Cui Dongshan swallowed hard, placing his hands behind his back and looking up at the sky, casually saying, “Today’s moon is really round.” 

It turned out that beside him stood a scholar in a Confucian robe— it was the National Master Cui Zhan. 

Cui Dongshan slowly turned his head, feigning innocence, “What brings you here? Fancy meeting you!” 

Cui Zhan chuckled coldly, “What? Not going to say ‘What a coincidence to meet you during the flowering season’?” 

Cui Dongshan, embracing his reckless attitude, pointed at Cui Zhan’s nose and shouted, “Old bastard! What? You’re not convinced? Which of my words is incorrect? If you can point it out, I’ll take your surname! You’ll be my grandson!” 

Ruan Xiu shook her head. 

It was rare to see someone looking for trouble in such a creative manner. 

Cui Zhan didn’t even pay him any mind. Years ago, at the lakeside of Shujian, he would have at least acknowledged him. 

Cui Zhan gazed southward, then shifted his gaze westward, “Do you know where the real chessboard is?” 

Cui Dongshan frowned, “Central Plains? Is there a way out over there?” 

Cui Zhan mocked, “You’re just a frog in a well now.” 

Cui Dongshan exclaimed, “Old bastard, climb out of that well and explain it to me!” 

Cui Zhan brushed off Cui Dongshan’s hand and said slowly, “The chessboard between Qi Jingchun and me is the world, the entire world. What use is a filthy Shujian Lake?” 

Even Cui Dongshan had to stop in shock at that moment. 

Ruan Xiu didn’t want to think about such things; it seemed tiresome. 

Cui Zhan calmly said, “I’ll say no more. Just wait. But even for you, it’ll take many years before you grasp the key points of this game. Even Chen Ping’an, who’s in the thick of it, might not know what he did back then for a long time, maybe even for the rest of his life.” 

Cui Dongshan no longer held a playful demeanor; his face turned solemn as he said in a low voice, “Cui Zhan, I’ll be watching closely!” 

Cui Zhan disappeared in an instant. 

Cui Dongshan sighed. 

He continued on with Ruan Xiu in silence. 

After entering Longquan County, a light drizzle began to fall. 

Cui Dongshan suddenly felt delighted, reaching out to catch the raindrops, murmuring, “The Master has returned, with the apricot blossoms and spring rain back home.” 

Amidst the mountains surrounding Shujian Lake, another year passed— spring, summer, autumn, and winter. 

The group finally completed their journey. 

However, compared to the previous two times, there was one more person: Gu Can. 

Thus, the journey became slower and more arduous. 

As for the clashes with those wicked cultivators and ghostly practitioners, they felt trivial in comparison. 

Within the borders of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, war had already broken out. 

During that expedition, even Zeng Ye discovered something unusual. 

Those mountain spirits, ghosts, and fierce beasts roaming the mountains would tremble in fear at the sight of Mr. Chen. Even a slight disturbance in their thoughts would send some of the timid ones fleeing in panic. 

Gu Can was growing increasingly taciturn, but his gaze became more resolute. 

During this period, Gu Can experienced confusion, struggles, anger, and even contemplated giving up twice. 

The man who had changed from a green cotton robe to a blue shirt and then back to cotton was not very talkative; he merely stood beside Gu Can, sometimes speaking, sometimes remaining silent. 

When facing those murderous ghostly practitioners and wild cultivators, Mr. Chen would punch, strike, and wield his sword. 

Despite his frail physique and turbulent spirit, every punch and strike was incredibly swift. 

Unyielding. 

Even the weapon known as the “Sword Immortal,” which was half a divine weapon, gradually became extremely docile, circling around its master gently after being drawn, like a bird seeking comfort. 

This year’s end approached. 

On the way back, they finally welcomed a heavy snowfall. 

In the spring breeze of that year, they returned to Shujian Lake. 

On a high mountain, the faint green lake water could be seen. 

Gu Can suddenly said, “Chen Ping’an, let me walk down alone from now on.” 

Chen Ping’an turned to look at Gu Can, whose eyes were filled with determination, and gently asked, “Have you thought it through? You could die. I can accompany you for another year.” 

Gu Can shook his head, “That’s enough!” 

Chen Ping’an ruffled his hair gently. 

Gu Can continued, “But if one day, and I mean if, you, Chen Ping’an, get killed by someone, I will definitely hold back at first, and then I’ll kill that person’s whole family, even digging up their ancestors’ graves, one by one. By then, you won’t be able to stop me or scold me.” 

Chen Ping’an could only smile helplessly. 

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi listened, their hearts gripped with fear. 

You should know that since Gu Can decided to cultivate, his speed in doing so was so remarkable that even Ma Duyi felt like a cripple on the path to cultivation. Gu Can wasn’t merely walking; he was practically riding a celestial ferry. 

For Gu Can had already become a practitioner at the Cave Dwelling stage and was about to break through his bottleneck. 

Thus, Chen Ping’an parted ways with Gu Can and the others, riding north alone, stating that he might take a celestial ferry one day to return quickly to Longquan County. 

One person, one horse. 

He crossed the borders of Shujian Lake and entered the territory of the Shi Hao Kingdom. 

Often, passersby would see a young swordsman in a blue shirt, both him and his horse thin as canes, yet his eyes sparkled brightly. 

After that, Chen Ping’an no longer rode, moving slowly northward. 

His thin horse quickly grew strong, but its master remained as lean as ever. 

One day, Chen Ping’an was leading his horse along a muddy path, passing through an endless field of rapeseed flowers. 

He paused, and the horse, almost as if sensing his intent, stopped its hooves in unison. 

Chen Ping’an sat on the ridge of the field, while the horse wandered nearby. 

He scratched his head, took out a flask for nurturing swords, had a sip of wine, then held the flask and said, “Mr. Qi, you’re really gone, huh? I thought I could see you one last time.” 

Chen Ping’an laughed. 

Well, seeing himself in such a miserable state, perhaps even the little junior of Mr. Qi wouldn’t want to be near him anymore, right? 

Once, on a stormy night, on a mountain cliff path. 

An old man in white, after parting with his maid, severed one of her tails. 

On the path, a middle-aged scholar with slightly graying hair appeared, smiling as he waited. 

At that moment, the old man in white smiled, “Well, I wanted to find you, but you didn’t show up. I lost hope, yet you came on your own.” 

That fox demoness, resembling a woman in palace attire, stepped back in trepidation, keeping a respectful distance. 

Before parting with Bai Ze, the blue-clad scholar gently handed him a water ball made from concentrated essence, smiling, “In a few years—maybe two or three, maybe four or five, I can’t precisely say—so I trouble you, Bai Laoye, to keep an eye on it. Once you see it, you can decide what to do.” 

Bai Ze, slightly perplexed, nodded in agreement, accepting the small object. 

For this scholar was Qi Jingchun. 

Arriving in the Central Plains, near the banks of the Great River close to Bai Di City, Bai Ze told the chief of the Confucian Academy, “I want to see again.” 

On that isolated overseas island. 

After sending Zhao Yao away. 

The middle-aged scholar handed the world’s most esteemed scholar a bowl of water, smiling, “Since you are utterly disappointed with the world, then I must make a bet with you.” 

That scholar smiled, “Others may not be able to, but betting with you, Qi Jingchun, is acceptable.” 

Thus, after Qi Jingchun left, that scholar neither sought him out nor saw him again. 

He too had to wait and see. 

Ultimately, in the Kingdom of Colorful Garments, their final meeting was also their last farewell. 

Qi Jingchun smiled at a young man, saying, “Let me accompany you for one last spar.” 

The young man threw a punch. 

Qi Jingchun stood by, leisurely responding with a punch, his heart slowly saying, “Little junior, you’ve worked hard. I placed such a heavy burden on your shoulders; I’m sorry.” 

At that moment, the young man was simply heartbroken as he fought. 

Unaware that the Qi he respected the most was tearfully filled with guilt. 

This year, spring returned. 

In the Central Plains, 

Bai Ze left that grand town and willingly came to the orthodox Confucian temple. 

The most accomplished scholar in the world, wielding a sword for distant travels, was unparalleled, unmatched by any sword immortal under heaven. 

Meanwhile, on Baopingzhou, a young man sat on horseback, fast asleep. 

The flowers on the ridge bloomed again, and the master slowly returned.

 ### Chapter 517: The Truth Revealed at Shujian Lake (Part 1)

On the way back north.

Chen Ping'an halted his horse atop an unnamed high peak, planning to search nearby for a fairy crossing to take a boat back to Longquan County in the Great Li Kingdom. Taking advantage of the last bit of daylight, he laid out some bamboo slips that had not seen the light of day in a long time. These included pieces from the descendants of the Qing Shen Mountain bamboo, common green bamboo from the hills, and purple bamboo from the island at Shujian Lake.

The nearby mountains rolled in waves, with a merchant road winding through them. After entering the mountains, he could vaguely see some merchants hurrying about.

Chen Ping'an deliberately chose a narrow side path and walked a few miles along the ridge before arriving at this mountaintop to sun the bamboo slips.

After laying out all the bamboo slips, he squatted down nearby, lost in thought. 

The thought of the immense debt he owed made his head throb.

Taking a sip of wine, Chen Ping'an constantly reassured himself that once he returned to Longquan County, he would, under Wei Ban's arrangements, become a major landowner. With a bit of composure, what were a few debts worth?

He rubbed his cheeks, feeling that he was right; wealth was an external thing, and a gentleman acquires wealth through the right means... Chen Ping'an slapped himself on the cheek. Did he really think of himself as a kind-hearted young man?

Turning his head, he spotted an old scholar he had encountered earlier on the road, panting and standing at a distance. Upon seeing him, the old man seemed frightened and was about to turn back down the mountain.

At that time, Chen Ping'an rode past the old scholar and the young attendant. Observing their footsteps and breathing, they appeared to be ordinary people. Of course, if they were truly exceptional beings hiding their abilities, he had no intention of prying.

The young attendant, carrying a load, did not follow the old scholar, perhaps because the old man wished to climb high alone to express his thoughts before heading back to continue his journey.

It was also possible that the old scholar was a hidden expert disguised as a scholar, seeing Chen Ping'an as a plump lamb to be slaughtered? 

Chen Ping'an was indifferent to all of this.

The old scholar seemed to have undergone a battle of wits within himself, finally deciding to approach Chen Ping'an. He bent down to look at the bamboo slips from a distance of ten-odd steps, studying them for a moment, and then turned around with a relieved smile, asking, “Young man, are you traveling alone to seek knowledge?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and nodded with a smile, “You could say that, I just want to explore a bit more.”

“Hmm, not bad, not bad. Traveling ten thousand miles and reading ten thousand books, today’s youth are getting lazier in buying and reading books, yet they suffer more hardships.” 

The old scholar nodded, then asked, “Do you mind if I take a closer look at your precious bamboo slips?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Please, old sir, feel free to look.”

Soon, Chen Ping'an began to regret his response. The old man not only looked at the bamboo slips but also asked numerous questions. “Where do these sayings come from?” Sometimes, when Chen Ping'an mentioned the titles of books and their authors, the old scholar became even more interested, asking if he knew the scholarly roots and intentions of those authors. Chen Ping'an struggled to answer; the old scholar was not very polite, and his knowledge was profound and familiar, often giving Chen Ping'an a thorough lesson on his superficial understanding. Chen Ping'an could only nod repeatedly, humbly accepting the old man's critiques.

The old scholar seemed undeterred by the trouble, and the young attendant called out to him twice from a distance, but the old man refused to budge. Finally, the attendant simply set down his burden and sat alone, sighing.

After a full hour or more, the old man finally finished examining the bamboo slips and asking his questions.

He suddenly smiled and asked, “Young man, I particularly like twenty-four of these bamboo slips. Would you be willing to part with them?”

Chen Ping'an decisively shook his head, “No way.”

He wasn't particularly familiar with this old gentleman.

Chen Ping'an had firmly resolved not to play the kind-hearted young man anymore.

The old scholar became somewhat agitated, “You, having read so many principles from books, how can you be so miserly? Scholars of the world are one family; what’s the harm in giving away a few bamboo slips?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “Unfortunately, old sir, your learning is profound, but I still cannot afford it. Moreover, the principle of ‘do not impose on others what you do not desire for yourself’ is also from the books. Please do not force me, or I might have to be rather unkind.”

The old man pointed at Chen Ping'an, “You little rascal, you only read some twisted theories. Forget it, forget it. Since you’ve used such a grand principle as ‘do not impose on others,’ I suppose I’ll just comfort myself with the notion that ‘a gentleman does not take away what others cherish.’”

Chen Ping'an chuckled but said nothing.

The old man, clearly still not giving up, saw that Chen Ping'an was not budging at all and had to gather his courage to ask again, “Really not sending me any? If twenty-four is too many, how about twelve?”

Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, “Old sir, really cannot. These bamboo slips and their content hold significant meaning for me; I must take them home and treasure them properly. Each slip represents a moment and a mindset, and taking them out to sunbathe is a moment of reflection.”

The old man huffed, “That just means you are a dead bookworm. If the principles were truly absorbed, why would you still need to look at the bamboo slips?”

Chen Ping'an found this amusing. Damn, this old gentleman has principle after principle, and at the end of the day, he just wants to take those twenty-four bamboo slips for free? Chen Ping'an had long realized that many of the forty-five slips the old man cherished were made of Qing Shen Mountain green bamboo and the purple bamboo from the island. Once Chen Ping'an agreed, the old man would simply take away the spiritually infused slips. If the old scholar genuinely loved the text, that would be fine, but if he were a cultivator with a bit of insight, aiming to covet those spiritual bamboos, would Chen Ping'an really have to turn hostile and fight to reclaim the slips?

Seeing that Chen Ping'an’s attitude was resolute, the old scholar gave up, grumbling and complaining.

Chen Ping'an began gathering the bamboo slips, noticing the old man’s expression as though each slip was a silver coin slipping away from his grasp, his face filled with regret.

Seeing this made Chen Ping'an feel a touch of pity. While he couldn't part with twenty-four slips, twelve was also out of the question. How about offering six slips just to ease the old man's heart? After all, the old gentleman had spent over an hour here. Chen Ping'an felt a bit weary from it all, and surely this old man was not having an easy time either. Even if he was coveting the slips, it was exhausting to squat and chatter for so long at his age. Moreover, the old man’s profound knowledge and eloquence were genuinely impressive. He was just a bit greedy, which was something Chen Ping'an could understand.

The old man was already pulling out all the stops, hastily advising Chen Ping'an, “Young man, the sun is so bright; don’t rush to put them away. While the weather is good, you should sun them a bit longer. Bamboo slips fear worm infestation and water damage... If you’re worried about the sun setting and not having enough time to gather them, I can help! Your actions are disrespectful to these slips and the beautiful words contained within!”

Chen Ping'an felt somewhat persuaded, stopping his movements and smiling as he asked, “Old sir, may I ask a somewhat intrusive question?”

The old man shook his head and cautiously suggested, “Then perhaps it’s better not to ask? Us scholars are quite sensitive about our pride.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “So, old sir, do you still want to receive a few bamboo slips?”

The old man replied decisively, “Feel free to ask!”

Chen Ping'an wiped his face, feeling as if he had fallen into a trap.

The old man surreptitiously took out a green bamboo slip lying on the ground, murmuring, “Accumulating earth into mountains, wind and rain arise. What a wonderful saying... It’s just that the carving is a bit rough, lacking spirit, hardly pleasing to the eye. Why hold onto it? Better to give it away and have it re-carved…”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “Old sir, I have sharp ears; I can hear you.”

The old man looked astonished, “I didn’t say anything; how could you hear? Young man, are you a mountain deity who can hear my thoughts?”

Seeing the old man’s expression and his earnest gaze, Chen Ping'an found it strange. Was he really just an old scholar passing through?

However, this wasn’t too surprising. In this region, scholars from Confucian academies were indeed fewer in number compared to the wild cultivators at Shujian Lake or the celestial teachers in the mountains.

Moreover, being able to spend over an hour without revealing any trace was likely something a Confucian gentleman would be unable to achieve. Chen Ping'an didn’t believe that the sages of the Viewing Lake Academy had the leisure to joke around with him.

The old man sighed regretfully, “One cannot question the warmth and coldness of human feelings; my hands do not touch the books, and I resent myself for it.”

Chen Ping'an pretended not to hear.

The old man retorted angrily, “Young man, what happened to your keen hearing from before?!”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, looking up at the sky. “Old sir, I concede; you go ahead and choose the bamboo slips. I still have to hurry along, but remember which ones you’ve selected. There’s no need to tell me; I’m afraid I won’t be able to resist changing my mind.”

The old scholar asked, “Twenty-four slips?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Fewer is fine, but not more.”

The old scholar chuckled, feeling pleased, “That’s right, young man. You should be more magnanimous; it’s about time! Time is more precious than gold. Look at us wasting so much time here; isn’t it worth more than a few bamboo slips?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Yes, yes, yes, you’re right, old sir.”

Except for the slip in his hand, the old man began to rise and select his preferred bamboo slips, deliberately dragging his feet.

Chen Ping'an suddenly coughed.

The old man pretended not to hear.

Chen Ping'an could only bitterly smile, “Old sir, including the slip in your hand, that’s almost thirty slips now. Since you’re a scholar, can we not talk about trust?”

The old man suddenly realized and tucked the last slip into his sleeve. The spot where he stood was somewhat distant from Chen Ping'an, and after a few polite words, he left.

Once he reached the young attendant, the old scholar hurriedly urged, “Let’s go, let’s go, hurry up!”

The pair, an old man and a young boy, hurried away at a swift pace.

At this point, Chen Ping'an could roughly confirm that he had indeed run into a “high-level expert.”

He chuckled to himself, quietly putting away the remaining bamboo slips, then led his horse down the mountain. Arriving at the ancient tea and horse road, he continued to ride slowly, not encountering that old gentleman again. He believed the man was probably hiding somewhere, secretly enjoying himself.

On horseback, Chen Ping'an dozed off.

Unbeknownst to him, an old man was leading his horse beside him.

The old man smiled and asked, “Chen Ping'an, a person who builds bridges when meeting water and paves roads when encountering mountains is doing a good thing. Is there a possibility that later generations can also walk along these bridges and overcome their life challenges?”

Chen Ping'an remained unaware but gradually spoke from the depths of his heart, “Old sir, I’m just a frugal accountant, not some teacher. I would never dare to think such thoughts.”

Then came a question and answer exchange.

“This introspective inquiry, have you admitted defeat?”

“Of course, I’ve lost.”

“Are you disappointed?”

“I’m somewhat disappointed in myself; I didn’t do well enough, but I’m not too disappointed in the world.”

“Is that so?”

Another round of “idle chat” followed.

The old man’s words strayed far off course, wandering wherever his thoughts led.

The “Chen Ping'an” on horseback simply listened.

“The shadows of sages grow ever more distant. As the later generations, we can only follow behind them and take a glimpse. How do you, Chen Ping'an, feel about that?”

“I can only feel a sense of reverence. If I truly have the opportunity in the future to walk the same path as them, even if it's just to see the backs of those sages from afar, I would feel… honored.”

“Good!”

The old man loosened the reins, and the young attendant behind them shimmered with a glass-like brilliance, uncertain and ethereal.

On horseback, Chen Ping'an continued to ride slowly “in a dream,” moving further along the ancient tea and horse road.

The old man remained standing on the path, his form equally ethereal, like clouds or smoke.

When Chen Ping'an suddenly jolted awake, he realized it was already deep into the night. The two of them, one man and one horse, had left the mountains and arrived beside a river.

*(End of Chapter)*

 # Chapter 518: The Truth Revealed at Bookletter Lake (Part 2)

**Great Li Dynasty, Year 12 of Yongjia, Spring Equinox.**

As spring arrived, a third division of the Great Li cavalry, aside from Su Gaoshan and Cao Ping, entered the battlefield. The Zhu Ying Dynasty began to suffer consecutive defeats on multiple fronts, the capital was besieged, and its emperor’s seal and ancestral temple would soon be tarnished, merely a matter of days.

However, the vassal king, Song Changjing, had not set foot on Zhu Ying territory. One sunny day, amidst the spring breeze, the enormous mechanism ships of the Mo family swept across the sky above Zhu Ying, continuing southward.

Standing at the bow of the flagship, Song Changjing surveyed the land from a high vantage point. Scattered sword cultivators, unwilling to live in shame, took to the skies on their swords, launching futile attacks against this historic "fleet" that had never before appeared in the region of Baopingzhou. One by one, they fell, like the late arrival of firecrackers on the streets heralding spring, or the mournful cries of celestial cranes piercing through the sky, filling the hearts of Zhu Ying citizens witnessing this scene with profound sorrow.

Song Changjing wore his old fox fur coat. Years ago, Xu Ruo's branch of the Mo family had chosen to bet on Great Li, doing two key things: partnering with the Yin-Yang sect to construct an audacious imitation of the White Jade Capital, and amassing the wealth of Great Li, particularly the "toll fees" from Li Pearl Cave, along with treasures plundered from various national treasuries on their southward march. Despite Great Li's apparent prosperity over the years, it had been living beyond its means, deeply in debt to the Mo family. Especially after the Mo family’s main lineage chose Great Li, their spending had become extravagant, flowing like a mighty river, silently draining the national treasury.

For Great Li, especially the Ministry of Revenue, this represented not just ambition but ability. Why did the national master, Cui Zhan, hold the Minister of Revenue in such high regard? Even Song Changjing and the entire military respected officials from the Ministry of Revenue because of this understanding. Of course, when the cavalry approached the Ministry demanding military pay, no one spared any sentiments or put on a show of poverty; everyone was quite adept at playing the part. Song Changjing observed this without concern. Amidst the bickering and clashes between civil and military officials, and the younger generation of scholars taking up arms and entering the civil service, the boundaries between civil and military within the Song family’s court were increasingly blurred, which was a good thing.

As for the Ministry of Works, which had the closest ties with Mo family outsiders, they were inescapably the unsung heroes behind the scenes.

In contrast, the originally highest-ranking Ministries of Rites and Personnel would face awkwardness when it came time for merit evaluations. Thus, in the new developments concerning the Northern Peak of Great Li, as well as the alliance with the Great Sui, officials from the Ministry of Rites were very proactive in making appearances. They had no choice; the further the ministry was from the battlefield, the more it risked losing its status in the coming century of Great Li’s court, becoming a mere shadow of its former self, possibly even being devoured or infiltrated by the other six ministries.

After all, the Ministry of Justice had made notable achievements in intelligence gathering and recruiting cultivators, which could not be overlooked.

So, the Ministry of Rites had begun to make small moves, fearing that while others were expanding territory, they, the once most respected of Great Li's six ministries, would fall behind, reduced to a mere administrative office with nothing but empty benches inside. How could they expect to maintain their prestigious and powerful position at the top of Great Li's ministries, much less usher in fresh developments year after year?

Only the Ministry of Personnel was in disarray, as the old man Guan presided over it. No matter how much the internal factions quarreled, they still presented a united front to the outside world.

Even if the Ministry of Rites clamored for a Peaceful Days plaque, insisting that all matters concerning recommendations, inspections, issuance, records, and evaluations should be handled solely by them, reducing the Ministry of Justice, which originally shared half the responsibilities, to a mere administrative position, the old man Guan merely muddled through without taking a stance, dragging out the process. In the end, he even resorted to the clumsy excuse of being ill to avoid responsibility. Damn it, this old man, who enjoys feasting and drinking, is sturdier than many of the younger officials in the Ministry of Rites. Could he really fall sick? This old fox had grown bolder with age, and even the Minister of Rites, who was technically a junior to him, was said to be furious, complaining about the old man’s arrogance.

The court of Great Li was lively and bustling, and the various ministries had generated quite a few amusing anecdotes.

During this year's New Year celebrations, both Yichi Alley and Chier Street in the capital were especially busy with visitors exchanging New Year greetings.

As for these bureaucratic matters of “spring rivers and warm waters,” Song Changjing paid little attention. Under the prevailing circumstances, it was human nature; as long as things didn’t go too far, he wouldn’t interfere. In fact, he didn’t need to trouble himself with such trivialities, being a soldier at heart.

Because Song Changjing had to admit, the successful southward advance of the Great Li cavalry, and their solid footing, was largely due to that embroidered tiger.

A faint rainbow light erupted from the ground as a young sword cultivator hid among the mountains, seemingly targeting Song Changjing, the “great official” of Great Li. The sword light, like a white line, arced toward him, intent on piercing through. The flying sword carried a spirit of desperation and indignation.

Song Changjing waved his hand, signaling the accompanying celestial cultivators not to interfere. A weak flying sword from a six-realm sword cultivator wouldn’t even tickle a pure martial artist at the tenth realm, would it?

With a casual punch, Song Changjing sent the sword back into the ground, where it landed right beside the pale-faced young sword cultivator, who staggered but managed to maintain his stance, staring at the man standing at the bow with unimaginable power.

As the flying boat soared through the sky, the young sword cultivator found himself unable to muster the strength to strike again and fell to the ground.

Following that, the multitude of Mo family flying boats deliberately passed over the peak of South Mountain in the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

With a death wish, hundreds of sword cultivators awaited their fate alongside the revered deity of South Mountain.

More than ten sword boats within the vessel unleashed their flying swords in a torrential downpour toward the earth.

Above and below, two waves of flying swords met like a curtain of rain. The flying swords from the Mo family’s specially crafted boats clashed with the sword cultivators’ life swords in a cataclysmic explosion.

Occasionally, a life sword slipped through the cracks, only to be countered by the local Great Li cultivators and the summoned Yuan Ying and celestial cultivators, who successively unleashed their magical treasures to destroy them, creating a dazzling spectacle of multicolored light above South Mountain, reminiscent of the legendary celestial realm.

The golden body of the South Mountain deity, wielding a giant sword of sword energy forged with royal secrets, cleaved toward the vessel where Song Changjing stood. Yet, it was shattered with a punch from Song Changjing, who then struck again, obliterating the golden body of the South Mountain deity. Song Changjing ultimately stood atop the roof of the South Mountain temple, where the deity, having temporarily lost their golden form, was about to use the accumulation of a millennium’s incense to reforge their body and confront him once more.

Song Changjing spoke, “This is enough. Great Li has no intention of exterminating you all. All sword cultivators below the celestial realm can descend the mountain without fear. Celestial cultivators willing to surrender may follow me south; those unwilling to yield can stay quietly on South Mountain. I can assure you that even if there are some accounts to settle later, I won’t slaughter indiscriminately. Everyone will have a chance to avoid misfortune, and I will ensure the safety of you celestial sword cultivators. As for your possessions, most will be used to fund the Great Li military.”

Silence fell over South Mountain.

Song Changjing soared away, crashing down nearly half of the main hall of the South Mountain temple, obliterating a celestial sword cultivator who attempted to rally the other sword cultivators to resist the Great Li barbarians, leaving only their soul and a fading golden Dan.

If any cultivator were to look up from the mountain foot, they would see a majestic residence of celestial beings near the peak of South Mountain, reduced to ruins, kicking up a dust cloud like a massive yellow fog swirling around the summit.

Song Changjing returned to the temple at the mountain’s peak and nodded subtly to the South Mountain deity standing in the courtyard, signaling his understanding of the situation.

He took flight and returned to the ship.

The deity of Zhu Ying wore a complex expression and ultimately bowed to the unparalleled vassal king of Great Li. Many young sword cultivators, until this moment, were shocked to realize that the mountain's array had never been activated.

It was not just the deity fearing death, worried about the severance of the Dao, but also fearing that under resistance, the entire South Mountain and over a thousand sword cultivators would perish. Thus, they had remained hidden, hoping for the sword cultivators to generously meet their fate, willing to die with swords in hand. Many had their own private ambitions, including the South Mountain deity, who had hoped to negotiate with both the former and new rulers, so as not to be scorned in the future as a powerless figure after losing the title of South Mountain deity, having their incense offerings dwindle. Instead, perhaps through today’s battle, he could earn some recognition from the people and avoid trouble for Great Li, striving to secure the position of the top mountain deity for the future.

In the chaotic world of Baopingzhou, the Zhu Ying Dynasty was clearly on the decline and needed to secure a retreat.

Returning to the ship’s bow, Song Changjing placed his hand on the railing, where spiritual energy flowed slowly. The era of Great Li would soon change.

**Bookletter Lake, the residence of the Fan family in Pool Water City.**

A visitor arrived, presenting a yellow name card, requesting to see General Guan Yiran.

The doorkeeper did not dare to delay.

Among the four prominent figures stationed in the city with equivalent rank and authority, Guan Yiran of Pool Water City had gradually risen in status over the past year, subtly becoming a leading figure, while the other three frequently had to travel to Pool Water City for discussions. Guan Yiran, on the other hand, never needed to leave the city, which spoke volumes.

Rumors even circulated that Guan Yiran was the favored son-in-law of Su Gaoshan.

Moreover, the doorkeeper felt that one of the visiting youths looked somewhat familiar, though clad in a gray cotton robe and with a gaunt appearance, he could not quite place him.

Soon, the doorkeeper led the three visitors to meet General Guan Yiran, who had his official office set up in the Fan residence.

The three guests carried a large bamboo box on their backs.

Now out of the armor of the accompanying cultivators, Guan Yiran stood beneath the eaves of the modest official residence, somewhat surprised.

After waiting a long time for a banquet that never arrived, he was met instead with an uninvited guest he didn’t particularly like, Gu Can.

Regarding Gu Can's actions at Bookletter Lake, Guan Yiran naturally disapproved; it was both a matter of personal disposition and the subtle influence of the Guan family’s ethos. In life, one should adhere to the rules, and it was nothing short of a miracle that someone like Gu Can, who reveled in breaking them, had survived to this day amidst such chaos. However, since he was a friend of that person, Guan Yiran would not refuse to see him. A friend of a friend is not necessarily a friend, but he felt it necessary to show some courtesy.

In the current state of Bookletter Lake, with the main forces of the Great Li cavalry already withdrawn, the young Guan Yiran had unwittingly become the true power broker of the region, holding the lives and deaths of tens of thousands of wild cultivators in his hands, even more so than Liu Zhimao of Qingxia Island had been in his prime.

With a calm expression, Gu Can, along with his anxious companions Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, approached Guan Yiran to pay their respects.

The two sides moved forward almost simultaneously, standing in the courtyard. Guan Yiran smiled and said, “You must be Gu Can. What brings you here?”

Gu Can smiled as he produced a jug of wine, the osmanthus brew from Old Dragon City, and handed it to Guan Yiran, saying, “Chen Ping'an asked me to bring this jug of wine to General Guan, saying it’s a debt he owes you.”

Guan Yiran accepted the jug without refusal, only chuckling as he said, “The wine arrives, but the person does not; what’s the meaning of that?”

Guan Yiran then self-deprecatingly added, “Isn’t it better than the person arriving but the wine not?” 

He chuckled to himself.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that this young and promising general of Great Li had a good relationship with Mr. Chen.

Suddenly, Guan Yiran asked, “Gu Can, do you know why Chen Ping'an wanted you to deliver the wine?”

Gu Can nodded and replied, “Yes, he wants me to familiarize myself with General Guan. Even if I cannot receive any favors, as long as General Guan shares a drink, my return to Qingxia Island will be much smoother.”

Guan Yiran smiled, “You’re not foolish. Why were you so arrogant and reckless before, acting as if you didn’t care about anything?”

Gu Can admitted frankly, “I didn’t know better before. I thought everyone was a fool. Now I won’t dare.”

Guan Yiran nodded, “Alright then, let’s leave it at that. In the future, for small matters, feel free to come to me. For major issues, don’t come to this office to seek trouble; I really don’t have a good impression of you.”

Gu Can nodded and cupped his fists, saying, “I want to thank General Guan in advance for any small matters I may trouble you with. I don’t dare ask for much; right now, with debts piling up, there are too many expenses, but I’ll definitely bring a jug of wine.”

Guan Yiran glanced at Gu Can, said nothing, and nodded, “I’m busy with official matters, so I won’t entertain you.”

Gu Can, understanding the hint, took his leave.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi followed, exiting the Fan residence.

Walking down the main street of Pool Water City, Ma Duyi complained a bit, “You’re still young, yet you have such an air of authority.”

Gu Can dismissed it, shaking his head, “Being able to meet with us means he hasn’t got a big enough authority. The major events at the end of this year and the middle of next year will require dealings with this General Guan. If you’re unwilling to come to this office then, Miss Ma, you can explore Yanzai Street with Zeng Ye.”

Ma Duyi did not refuse but felt a bit apprehensive, “This place is too bureaucratic, especially the two fierce-looking Great Li guardian spirits posted at the entrance of the Fan residence. I would rather not come here to suffer.”

Zeng Ye nodded vigorously, “I think those staring eyes aren’t very friendly either. I’m surprised they let me, a ghost cultivator, through without stopping me; that was quite surprising.”

Gu Can led them to rent a boat now under the official control of Great Li. Regardless of whether they were cultivators or wealthy patrons enjoying the scenery, everyone had to present their identification and go through inspection at the dock before entering Bookletter Lake; this was the new rule. However, if one possessed a Peaceful Days plaque issued by Great Li, regardless of its grade, they didn’t need to follow such procedures and could even be offered a free boat ride across the lake. Yet, among the vast number of practitioners in Bookletter Lake, very few celestial cultivators had this privilege. The Celestial Lord of Su Lin Island, the top-ranking offering Yu Kuai of Qingxia Island, and the celestial couple of Huangli Island had yet to receive such treatment. This shows just how valuable even the lowest-grade Peaceful Days plaque was.

Recently, two pieces of news had spread throughout Bookletter Lake, shaking the entire region.

One was unrelated to the wild cultivators of Bookletter Lake but was nonetheless enormous: the emperor of Great Li had passed away.

The other was closely related to the tens of thousands of wild cultivators and over a thousand islands. When the shocking truth emerged, Bookletter Lake awakened to the reason behind its turbulent situation over the past two years.

It turned out that the largest celestial sect in Tongyezhou, the Yu Gui Sect, had chosen Bookletter Lake as the site for its lower sect.

Thus, since the beginning of spring this year, various news about the Yu Gui Sect had spread like a flurry of goose feathers in the wind.

However, for Gu Can, these major events had nothing to do with him.

Chen Ping'an had entrusted him with the opening of the Luo Tian Great Offering and the Water and Land Dharma Assembly.

Aside from transferring all the accounts to Gu Can, Chen Ping'an had meticulously detailed the guidelines for both major events, writing thousands of words outlining everything.

For this, Ma Duyi even teased that Mr. Chen was almost acting like a monk or Taoist priest himself.

As for the required funds, Chen Ping'an had discussed with Gu Can, sharing the costs evenly.

That was no small sum. What Gu Can’s mother had moved from the Spring Garden was far from enough.

Gu Can was not shy about it, saying he would first borrow from Chen Ping'an.

Before leaving, Chen Ping'an sat down with Gu Can to go through the accounts carefully. Gu Can would need at least two more years, including the Luo Tian Great Offering and the Water and Land Dharma Assembly, along with the experiences Chen Ping'an had in the Shihou Kingdom and Mei Gui Nation, to pay off half of his debts. After that, Gu Can would still need to continue his travels and strive to create a suitable mountain for ghostly and spectral practice in Bookletter Lake in the future.

The three of them took the boat slowly toward Qingxia Island.

Gu Can, carrying the bamboo box, stood at the bow. This young man, diligently repaying debts, had been carrying the burden of the underworld’s Yama Hall for over a year now.

Transforming into a ghostly spirit after death might seem fortunate, but it was, in fact, a form of suffering.

Whether common folk or cultivators, they were inevitably burdened by deep-seated attachments to the mortal world. Yet, the matters of life and death are the laws of nature; heaven and earth have their rules, and punishment falls upon them. Time flows, the twenty-four solar terms turn, spring thunder rumbles, summer heat rises, and the various unseeable winds of nature, which do not affect ordinary mortals, instead torment and torture spirits. The morning bells and evening drums of ancient temples, the incense of civil and martial temples, the door gods posted in the market, the clamor of war and weapons—all of these cause varying degrees of harm to ordinary spirits.

Moreover, one must also consider the exorcists and demon-slayers who accumulate merit, the wild cultivators of mountains and marshes, particularly those ghostly and wicked cultivators who delight in capturing the souls of spirits, separating and reshaping souls, and employing all manner of sinister techniques and secret arts. The trials they face truly make life worse than death.

Before Chen Ping'an arrived at Bookletter Lake, Gu Can had known some of these matters but had never taken them seriously, always too lazy to investigate further.

Now, things were different.

Halfway through their journey on the water, a fast-moving ship from Qingxia Island approached.

The Celestial Lord of Tianhu descended onto the small boat where Gu Can was.

Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye both thought Gu Can wouldn’t board that ship, but Gu Can did not refuse the invitation of the Celestial Lord of Tianhu, expressing gratitude to the small boat before stepping onto the larger vessel.

The Celestial Lord of Tianhu was jovial.

Gu Can exchanged smiles and words with her, as if there were no awkwardness at all, reminiscent of the glory days of Qingxia Island, where he was once the little junior beside the senior sister.

The Celestial Lord of Tianhu joked, saying, “Our Mr. Chen seems to owe quite a bit of money; the treasury of Qingxia Island is in dire straits. The Yama Hall and the imitated Glazed Pavilion built to help Mr. Chen draft an IOU for Yu Kuai are no small expenses.”

Gu Can chuckled, saying, “Such a big matter can wait for the master’s return to Qingxia Island. It’s best left to him to decide.”

The Celestial Lord of Tianhu's expression suddenly turned awkward.

Now at Bookletter Lake, nearly no wild cultivators believed Liu Zhimao could still leave the water prison of Gongliu Island alive.

If he could leave, Liu Zhimao would have returned to Qingxia Island long ago; why would he need to drag it out to this day? Now that Su Gaoshan had left, everyone believed it would only be a matter of time before the new leader of the Yu Gui Sect appeared and Liu Zhimao’s death would be imminent.

Having not worn that green python robe for a long time, Gu Can, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, turned to look at the Celestial Lord of Tianhu, whose expression was fluctuating, and softly said, “Senior sister, in pursuit of the Dao, it’s not a fault to do some things against your conscience, but there should still be a couple of bottom lines. I became Liu Zhimao’s close disciple through twists and turns, and the intrigue and mutual exploitation are evident to all in Bookletter Lake. Therefore, the bond between master and disciple isn’t my limit. However, senior sister, you are Liu Zhimao’s prized disciple, and the opportunities you’ve had at Qingxia Island are not lacking. If you step too far, think about it: in the records of Great Li, in Guan Yiran’s eyes, and in the perception of wild cultivators in Bookletter Lake, your reputation will not be favorable. Since you’re already a celestial cultivator, shouldn’t you see further? After all, the rules in Bookletter Lake have increased significantly now. What worked before doesn’t apply anymore.”

The Celestial Lord of Tianhu softly asked, “Is this what Mr. Chen wants you to convey to me?”

Gu Can shook his head, “This has nothing to do with Chen Ping'an. He sees your actions more clearly than I do and wouldn’t say such things to you. However, over the years, I have some feelings towards you, senior sister, so I wanted to share some heartfelt words. Listening or not is up to you. I understand that it’s the poor who don’t invite people to the wine table. Though I know the reasoning, I still feel that even if it might be unwelcome, I need to say it.”

The Celestial Lord of Tianhu sighed, “There’s no turning back now.”

Gu Can smiled, just the old Gu Can, nothing more.

It was a pity that senior sister Tian Hu Jun had not met her Chen Ping'an.

At this thought, Gu Can began to gaze into the distance, feeling the vastness of the world. Even if the future seemed bleak, there was no need to be overly afraid.

With his heart lightening, Gu Can withdrew his gaze and said, “Senior sister, don’t worry. The remaining territory and foundation of Qingxia Island are yours and your fellow disciples’ to compete for. I have little to gain and don’t wish to fight for anything. With my capabilities, I can gain nothing by competing with you. It’s better to be amiable and withdraw voluntarily; perhaps in the future, we can share a drink together. Besides, I won’t be in Qingxia Island for many days a year. Instead of being wary of me, it’s better for you to explore various avenues.”

Tian Hu Jun felt Gu Can’s sincerity but looked increasingly uneasy. However, the fact that Gu Can was willing to “open his heart” to her was better than her being in constant suspicion.

It wasn’t that Tian Hu Jun fully believed Gu Can’s “heartfelt words,” but now Gu Can had to find a protective charm from the Fan residence in Pool Water City before entering Bookletter Lake. After boarding the ship, he needed to use the improbable phrasing that “Liu Zhimao might leave Gongliu Island safely” to secure himself an escape route. This eased Tian Hu Jun’s mind a little. Without the slippery eel and without Chen Ping'an by his side, Gu Can truly was not competent at all!

The large ship docked at Qingxia Island, and Gu Can did not mention going to the Spring Garden, saying he could stay in a house at the mountain gate, as a neighbor to his friend Zeng Ye.

In the end, Ma Duyi monopolized Chen Ping'an’s room, pushing Gu Can over to Zeng Ye’s side.

Gu Can didn’t mind.

Having spent time together, he found that Ma Duyi, with her sharp tongue but soft heart, was not unpleasant. The longer they stayed together, the more he felt it was quite good.

Chen Ping'an might think he had said everything about life in Bookletter Lake.

Meanwhile, Gu Can felt that he had heard all the flattering words from others during his years in Bookletter Lake.

Afterward, Gu Can went to see the ruins of Hengbo Mansion and paused outside the Spring Garden for a moment.

On this beautiful spring day, Gu Can, Zeng Ye, and Ma Duyi sat side by side on a small bamboo chair, basking in the sun.

A tall woman in palace attire disembarked from a ship, approaching gracefully.

It was Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island.

Gu Can only knew that Chen Ping'an felt some guilt toward this island lord, claiming to owe her some celestial money. Therefore, even if Liu Chongrun did not come to Qingxia Island, Gu Can would still visit Zhu Chai Island to speak with her, so that this magnificent island lord wouldn’t misunderstand that Chen Ping'an had run off after accumulating debts. 

Now, Liu Chongrun was remarkable. The most peculiar thing was that even though Liu Chongrun had revealed her true strength as a Golden Core celestial cultivator, she had managed to carve out a path amidst the jealousy of numerous island lords, securing a low-level Peaceful Days plaque from Great Li for entry. This had sparked many speculations, such as whether Su Gaoshan had taken a liking to Liu Chongrun’s beauty or whether Guan Yiran, the young man in a powerful position, was fond of beautiful women. After all, Liu Chongrun was once a long princess of the Zhu Ying royal family, who had captured the hearts of many sword cultivators.

Gu Can knew very well that there were none of these sordid tales; it was simply that Chen Ping'an had leaked some heavenly secrets. As a princess of a fallen dynasty, Liu Chongrun had exchanged a hidden water palace treasure, still undiscovered by the Zhu Ying Dynasty, for the protection of that plaque, which not only preserved all her belongings on Zhu Chai Island but also allowed her to rise to become one of Great Li's offering cultivators. 

Whether Chen Ping'an had facilitated this, he had not mentioned.

When Liu Chongrun saw Gu Can rise to greet her, she smiled and asked, “When will Mr. Chen return to Bookletter Lake?”

Gu Can shook his head, “Not known for the time being, but it’s unlikely to be soon.”

Liu Chongrun’s expression remained calm as she nodded, seemingly ready to leave just like that.

Gu Can stood up, following the island lord, and chatted about the matters entrusted to him by Chen Ping'an.

Liu Chongrun did not comment, nor did she give a clear response, simply departing.

Gu Can returned to the small bamboo chair.

At the dock, a ghost cultivator from Zhu Xianfu appeared.

Liu Chongrun hesitated for a moment but still stopped, sighing, “Ma Yuan Zhi, it’s been so many years of entanglement; is it worth it? If you have this heart, why not cultivate diligently and strive to become a celestial being sooner?”

The ghost cultivator, intentionally dressed in an elegant green robe, grinned, “Long Princess, you know Mr. Chen isn’t at Qingxia Island and still come this way. I’m well aware.”

Liu Chongrun's anger flared, “Get away from me!”

Ma Yuan Zhi did not dare to block her path and obediently stepped aside, allowing Liu Chongrun to walk straight to the Zhu Chai Island boat.

But he could not help but sneak glances at the princess's graceful figure; she was simply enchanting.

Liu Chongrun halted and turned around.

Noticing Ma Yuan Zhi's lascivious gaze, she sternly said, “Are you looking for death?!”

Ma Yuan Zhi swallowed hard, feeling wronged, “Isn’t it because I’m worried about you, Princess? After the recent turmoil, I was just concerned whether you had become thin or weary. Now that I see you well, I can finally rest easy.”

Taking the opportunity, he stole another glance at her bosom, which was truly a sight to behold.

Liu Chongrun erupted, “You filthy creature!”

Ma Yuan Zhi lamented, “I won’t allow you to mistreat yourself, Princess. Even if you were to step on me, I wouldn’t complain. But to speak such harsh words against yourself, I cannot abide. In my heart, you will always be the most beautiful and flawless woman in the world…”

Liu Chongrun suddenly realized her slip of tongue and, in a fit of anger, swept her sleeve out, sending the ghost cultivator tumbling out of the dock.

Once Ma Yuan Zhi regained his composure, he was filled with mixed emotions, tears brimming in his eyes. After so many years of grievances and hardships, he finally felt somewhat compensated, murmuring, “Princess, women are shy and have difficulty expressing sweet nothings directly. It’s alright. Beating is love, scolding is affection; I understand.”

Liu Chongrun flew away using celestial techniques, swiftly departing.

She was truly fed up with that foolish glutton.

Ma Yuan Zhi nodded, a radiant smile on his face, more pleased than ever, “Princess, being so shy is a rare occurrence; it seems you truly intend to open your heart to me. There’s a chance! Absolutely a chance! Chen Ping'an, just wait for the wedding feast! What a good brother! If it weren’t for you telling me to ponder the implications of a woman’s words, how could I have realized your good intentions? You want me to hurry up and reach the Golden Core celestial realm, which is a hint that I should not lag behind you too much, right? It’s not that you are worried about me having a grudge since I’ve already attained Golden Core. If you didn’t have feelings for me, would you go to this extent to communicate?”

After the ghost cultivator left, beaming with joy, Zeng Ye, uncertain about the relationship between the ghost cultivator and the island lord, asked softly, “Did that ghost cultivator misunderstand something?”

Ma Duyi, munching on seeds, asserted, “If I were her, I’d slap him dead. It would save the hassle of him getting fresh every time they met.”

Gu Can chuckled, “Do you think the island lord likes Chen Ping'an?”

Zeng Ye thought for a moment and shook his head, “Unlikely. There’s quite an age difference, and they don’t interact often. The island lord is ultimately a determined Golden Core cultivator. Even if Mr. Chen is excellent, I don’t think it’s likely.”

Ma Duyi scoffed, “If Liu Chongrun likes Mr. Chen, that’s no surprise. But our Mr. Chen wouldn’t fancy an elderly woman.”

Gu Can laughed heartily from the small bamboo chair. 

Ma Duyi tossed a handful of seeds his way, but Gu Can dodged, causing them to land on Zeng Ye’s head. This was not all; Zeng Ye then bent down to pick them up, having been around Chen Ping'an for so long, it was difficult not to be drawn to wealth.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 519: The Unveiling of Shujian Lake (Part 2)**

**Gongliu Island.**

Inside the watery prison.

A prisoner clad in plain white linen sat cross-legged in a relatively spacious cell, his expression calm and composed.

Outside the cell stood an elderly cultivator from Tongye Continent, a figure of the Fifth Stage. This was none other than Zhou Fenglu, the former ancestor of Tongye Sect, who had once joined forces with the Sect Leader of Taiping Mountain and Jiang Shangzhen of Yuguizong to slay a great beast at sea. Now, however, he had switched allegiances to Yuguizong, even taking a prized treasure from Tongye Sect's ancestral hall, nearly inciting a war between Tongye and Yuguizong. Fortunately, the old Sect Leader of Yuguizong, Xun Yuan, personally visited to negotiate with the Tongye Sect's eleventh-stage Sword Immortal, resulting in a discussion that eased tensions. It seemed that Yuguizong had offered compensation, and Tongye Sect decided not to pursue the matter further.

Zhou Fenglu was the decision-maker for Yuguizong's new branch location, but whether he would be the one to lead it depended on the final choice of the new sect leader—whether it would be the industrious and politically savvy Zhou Fenglu or that scoundrel Jiang Shangzhen, who already held the fortune of Yunku.

Zhou Fenglu had not killed Liu Zhimiao outright because he wanted to accumulate more merit, hoping to gain the covert support of a few influential figures within Yuguizong to help him ascend to power. This would also help persuade the stubborn elders of the ancestral hall who leaned toward Jiang Shangzhen. Yuguizong was not a monolithic entity, and many older members had long been displeased with the rising star Jiang Shangzhen.

This was Zhou Fenglu's opportunity.

Once he became the first leader of the new branch, he would be a significant regional authority in Yuguizong, securing a position in the ancestral hall and possibly sitting right next to Jiang Shangzhen. Many in Yuguizong who were wary of Jiang’s growing power would likely support Zhou’s rise, allowing them to suppress Jiang’s arrogance and irritate him in the process.

Zhou Fenglu’s expression darkened. "Liu Zhimiao, this is the third time I've come to you. Three strikes, and you should understand?"

Liu Zhimiao glanced sideways at him. "We wild cultivators, whom you so-called lineage cultivators look down on, are used to scavenging like wild dogs. We can't be house pets."

Zhou Fenglu sneered. "You proactively contacted Tan Yuanyi to pledge allegiance to the Song Clan of the Great Li. Isn't that being a watchdog?"

Liu Zhimiao chuckled. "Serving the Great Li is still free-range—better than being cooped up. Besides, the thing I dislike most in this life is your arrogant lineage cultivators."

Zhou Fenglu’s face darkened. "Do you really think I wouldn't dare to kill you? A Nascent Soul Earth Immortal like you may be notable in your corner of Baoping Continent, but here in Tongye, you mean nothing. The deaths of Fifth Stage cultivators are not uncommon. Every century, if a few Nascent Souls don't die, Tongye would feel embarrassed to greet the great cultivators of other continents. Can you say the same for your Baoping Continent?"

Liu Zhimiao laughed heartily. "Are you trying to scare me?"

Zhou Fenglu shook his head. "I’m not trying to scare you; a person's patience is limited."

Liu Zhimiao smirked. "Don't you know? We wild dogs have spent our lives getting scared. The more we're frightened, the tougher we become. If a ghost knocks at my door at midnight, I might just ask if they’ve come to do business with me. So what? You’re now the leader of Yuguizong’s new branch, and you can decide my fate? Even if you do become the leader, shouldn't you think carefully about how to make use of a Nascent Soul wild cultivator? What if one day I suddenly gain enlightenment and agree to serve you? Wouldn’t that be a huge win for you? Keeping me imprisoned, how much divine money does a formation cost? Can you not do the math? How can you even think of being a leader?"

Liu Zhimiao was bound by the prison's water veins, especially the key points that nurtured his life essence, which were obstructed by the water veins of Gongliu Island. He yawned. "Do you really think you outsiders can do as you please in Baoping Continent? Just because of your little patience, I reckon your seat as leader won’t be stable; you might even fare worse than me, the lord of Shujian Lake. Your chair won't even be warm before you have to get up and yield. I really don’t believe Yuguizong would hand over such a fat piece of meat to a half outsider."

In an unexpected twist, Liu Zhimiao began lecturing the formidable Zhou Fenglu, who wielded great power. "It's not that I’m criticizing you lineage cultivators; you all claim to have strong resolve, but you’re not necessarily better than us wild cultivators. Isn’t it because of your superior techniques and sect traditions that you walk the path so smoothly? Hand those techniques over to us, and even if we start from Earth Immortal, if we both spend the same amount of time, I guarantee we wild cultivators can beat you to a pulp. Don’t believe me? Let’s see if you dare! After all, you’ve already defected from Tongye Sect; those broken ancestral hall rules don’t mean a thing. Why not teach me the sect's techniques straight to the Fifth Stage? But would you dare?"

Liu Zhimiao's laughter rang out unabashedly, showcasing his audacity, though there was a hint of roguishness.

Zhou Fenglu shook his head. "Liu Zhimiao, I hope the next time we meet, after I become the leader of the new branch, you can still speak so defiantly."

Liu Zhimiao quickly replied, "Don't rush! Even if you become the leader, we can still chat. We wild cultivators, after all, care little for pride and are best at adapting to circumstances."

Zhou Fenglu left the water prison in silence.

This Nascent Soul wild cultivator from Shujian Lake was truly a tough nut—he couldn’t kill him, nor could he consume him. Zhou Fenglu was resolute; once he became the leader of the new branch, he would execute Liu Zhimiao without a word.

Upon returning to his residence, the true master of Gongliu Island, Liu Laocheng, entered the water prison's lower level. The cultivators of Yuguizong pretended not to see him, neither greeting nor stopping him.

Shujian Lake had three primary water veins, rich in spiritual energy, while the remaining veins were numerous but thin and fragmented, having been divided among the forces of over a thousand islands.

One of these veins was monopolized by Gongliu Island, with the prison's formation built upon it. This was the key to easily subduing Liu Zhimiao.

Qingxia Island had also seized a significant portion of another water vein, while Hengbo Mansion served as its formation's eye, but unfortunately, it had been destroyed, causing the water energy to dissipate, benefiting the Earth Immortal cultivators from subordinate islands like Tianhu Jun and Yu Huai.

The three major islands of Qingtuzang, Tianmu, and Lizu divided the last primary water vein of Shujian Lake among themselves.

After Liu Laocheng arrived at the prison's lower level, he immediately isolated a small realm.

Liu Zhimiao raised his head, frowning. He wasn’t particularly afraid of Zhou Fenglu, but he held a deep respect for Liu Laocheng, the elder from Shujian Lake.

Wild cultivators were always most adept at dealing with other wild cultivators. The lineage cultivators often found themselves at a loss.

Liu Laocheng took out a scroll, gently shook it, and unfurled it. From the scroll emerged a man with a cheerful smile.

He approached the prison, hands clasped behind his back, bending slightly to squint at Liu Zhimiao, and asked, "I hear you have a complicated relationship with Chen Pingan, both friend and foe. But let’s not discuss him for now. Liu Laocheng tells me you both acknowledge each other as confidants?"

This time, Liu Zhimiao was taken aback, unable to respond immediately. "You are... Jiang Shangzhen of Yuguizong?"

The man smiled broadly. "Answer my question first, and then I’ll see whether to answer yours. We should follow a proper order, don’t you think?"

Liu Zhimiao glanced at Liu Laocheng. Having gauged Zhou Fenglu's boundaries through their previous encounters, he felt he could afford to stall. However, facing someone he suspected to be Jiang Shangzhen of Yuguizong’s main family, he felt a weight in his heart and dared not speak carelessly. After a moment of contemplation, he nodded. "As of now, I don’t think I could ever be friends with Chen Pingan, whether I reach the Fifth Stage or he becomes capable enough to compete with me. We might even end up crossing swords. But for now, I could consider him a confidant; after all, we’ve had a few drinks together."

The man clapped his hands and laughed heartily. "With that alone, Little Liu, plus my old friend behind me, we three can be considered friends from now on!"

Liu Zhimiao looked back at Liu Laocheng, whose expression remained as calm as a deep well, offering no hint.

The man smiled. "You guessed correctly; I am indeed Jiang Shangzhen, the soon-to-be leader of Yuguizong's new branch."

Suddenly, the man wiped his face, feigning a sorrowful expression, as if a woman lamenting. "I’m so troubled! That shameless Zhou Fenglu nearly ruined my plans. If it weren’t for Li Fuqu’s cleverness, I would have risked everything to kill Zhou Fenglu and then bring his head to apologize! Just thinking about it makes me want to run to Li Fuqu and bow down to her, acknowledging her as my foster mother—what’s the harm in that?"

Jiang Shangzhen lightly patted his chest, his face filled with anguish as he cursed, "I, Jiang Shangzhen, didn’t come to Shujian Lake to wipe anyone's behind! The most important thing is to catch up with Chen Pingan. Now, what can I do? Zhou Fenglu, that incompetent old fool, is not worth my time. I merely hosted a few banquets at Tongye Sect, and now that we’re all on the same side, he still seeks to undermine me? Such malicious intent deserves death—truly deserving of it..."

Liu Zhimiao was left speechless.

Liu Laocheng's eyelids twitched slightly, evidently having encountered Jiang Shangzhen's character before. He seemed to be a bit more composed than Liu Zhimiao, who looked utterly stunned.

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly reined in his words and laughter, falling silent for a moment before softly asking, "Liu Zhimiao, I have a question from Zhou Fenglu: Are you willing to serve as a devotee of Yuguizong’s new branch?"

Liu Zhimiao hesitated.

In that instant, he caught a glimpse of Liu Laocheng nodding at him.

Taking a deep breath, Liu Zhimiao nodded lightly. "Alright."

Then he discovered a vibrant green willow leaf hovering perfectly at his brow.

Jiang Shangzhen snapped his fingers, grinning. "Those who know how to adapt are the wise ones. Liu Zhimiao, from now on, you will be the third seat among my devotees in the new branch: Liu Laocheng, Zhou Fenglu, Liu Zhimiao. However, I hope that once you reach the Fifth Stage, you can help me deal with Zhou Fenglu, by any means necessary. I can promise you that the Yuguizong treasure in Zhou Fenglu’s possession can be borrowed for a hundred years. As long as you achieve enough merit afterward, borrowing it for another hundred years won’t be difficult. But if you fail to kill him and end up getting killed yourself, don’t blame me for not collecting your corpse."

Liu Zhimiao asked, "About reaching the Fifth Stage?"

Jiang Shangzhen pointed his thumb at himself. "What do I have? Just money. Once you get to know me better, you’ll surely find yourself pitying me for being too wealthy—it's truly a headache."

Sighing, Jiang Shangzhen continued, "Don’t think that you wild cultivators of Baoping Continent are poor; even the lineage cultivators of the Fifth Stage in Tongye Sect don’t know the troubles of being this rich. It’s quite troublesome."

Liu Zhimiao glanced back at Liu Laocheng. Was it really wise to collaborate with such a person? Wouldn’t it be more stable to ally with Zhou Fenglu instead?

Liu Laocheng remained expressionless, betraying neither thoughts nor feelings.

It was well-known that money was the most painful topic for all wild cultivators.

As late spring approached.

The night was deep, and in a secluded area of Shujian Lake, all was silent.

An elderly gentleman stood by the lake, waving his sleeve to release twenty-four bamboo slips, each inscribed with golden characters that shone like the timeless moral writings of Confucian sages, rivaling the brilliance of the sun and moon.

The bamboo slips fell into Shujian Lake.

Twenty-four slips for the twenty-four solar terms.

Only three individuals in the entire Shujian Lake felt a resonance and were struck with a sense of awe.

Jiang Shangzhen, Liu Laocheng, and Zhou Fenglu.

Yet even as the three of them rushed into the air, scanning their surroundings, they could not detect a hint of the source.

In truth, the old sage was right under their noses, but even these three Fifth Stage cultivators could not see him.

However, the prisoner Liu Zhimiao, who had yet to leave Gongliu Island, suddenly recalled something.

Shujian Lake was once a place with thin spiritual energy, a mere ordinary land, until a Confucian sage from Central Plains visited, attaining the Great Dao and resonating with heaven and earth, resulting in a myriad of phenomena. The lake was thus named Shujian, brimming with spiritual energy and benefiting future generations.

The old sage stood at the lake's edge, smiling. "People think this place is a dump, yet some say it's a land of heroic spirit, eternally dignified through the ages. What do you think?"

The lake rippled gently, stirring up a surge of righteousness spanning millennia.

The old sage smiled. "I’m not asking you to be grateful to that young scholar; he doesn’t need it. Scholars do things like this—not for profit. So I just want you to sacrifice yourselves for righteousness. When the time comes, die once more with me, and don’t let this world, which still has hope, go to waste."

The old sage opened his hands, leaving behind four bamboo slips, and smiled. "Of course, that young man also said he’s currently not a scholar, just a bookkeeper. So how we proceed next is up for discussion."

At a celestial ferry in the central part of Baoping Continent.

As summer approached this year, a young man in a blue robe dismounted his horse.

Seventeen years old, he headed towards Shujian Lake, spending New Year's Eve alone in a house at the entrance of Qingxia Island’s mountain gate.

The following year, he spent New Year's Eve in an inn in Shihua Kingdom, chatting with Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi by the stove.

Another year, while riding toward a meeting with Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, he bumped along, spending another New Year's Eve alone.

The next year, he visited the mountains south of Shujian Lake, and on the return journey, he finally shared a New Year's Eve dinner with Gu Can, Zeng Ye, and Ma Duyi.

This year, at this very moment, after boarding the celestial ferry with his horse, Chen Pingan touched the jade hairpin on his head, realizing that unknowingly, he had reached the age where one transitions into adulthood according to Confucian norms.

Then, on the fifth day of the fifth month, Chen Pingan originally planned to request a table full of sumptuous dishes from the ferry. However, he changed his mind at the last moment, opting instead for some dried rations and wine. He stood by the window, gazing at the sea of clouds, celebrating his birthday in a simple way, even skipping the coming-of-age ceremony. After all, he had no family around, no elders, nor ancestral hall—there was no need for pomp and circumstance.

Just as he swallowed the last bite of dried food and drink, Chen Pingan had just let out a satisfied belch when he suddenly felt the sword on his back grow heavy, as if it had transformed from a few pounds into hundreds, causing him to stagger back and fall, sword and all, to the ground.

Yet, in the blink of an eye, the sword remained as lifeless as before, showing no signs of movement. Chen Pingan attempted to sit up, but felt nothing unusual.

Feeling puzzled, worried there might be some kind of trick, he sat at the table, pulled out the sword, and scrutinized it for some time, but found nothing out of the ordinary.

He decided that the sword was merely playing tricks on him; after all, it often behaved mischievously over the past six months. For instance, once when he attempted to admire the sunset over the sea of clouds, it had taken off on its own, causing him to plummet straight down. If it hadn't been for the looming danger on the fifteenth of the month, he would have been in for a world of trouble. How could he reason with a semi-immortal weapon? After that, he was hesitant to gaze at the scenery over the sea of clouds again.

At that moment, the sword unsheathed itself from Chen Pingan's back with a metallic clang, causing the entire celestial ferry to shake slightly as it hovered a foot above the floor.

It seemed to be inviting Chen Pingan to step onto it.

Chen Pingan crouched down, negotiating, "You won’t misbehave, right?"

The sword remained motionless.

After a moment of hesitation, he began haggling. "If you abandon me halfway, I won’t be able to catch the ferry; you’ll owe me for that divine money!"

The sword swiftly returned to its sheath on Chen Pingan's back.

It ignored him completely.

Chen Pingan rubbed his chin, recalling how he had nearly been tricked out of nearly thirty bamboo slips by an old man at the mountaintop. He nodded, "Almost fell for that again! My journey in this world hasn’t been in vain!"

 ### Chapter 520: A Lamp in the Ancestor's Home at the Alley

The celestial ferry wouldn’t take him directly to Longquan County in the Great Li Empire. After all, the Bagua Pavilion had already vacated from Ox Horn Mountain, and the ferry terminal had nearly fallen into disrepair. Officially, it had been temporarily requisitioned by the Great Li military, but it wasn’t a strategic location. The ferries were scarce, mostly transporting the local nobility who came to Longquan County to enjoy its scenic beauty. With rumors circulating about Longquan County’s imminent upgrade from a county to a state, this meant that the Great Li bureaucracy would suddenly have a dozen high-ranking seats available. As the Great Li cavalry swept through and claimed half of the territory on Baoping Continent, local officials saw their statuses rise dramatically. Local officials with Great Li residency were now akin to the "capital officials" of small vassal states. Once they were dispatched to the southern vassals, a promotion was practically guaranteed.

The ferry Chen Ping’an was on would dock at a small country terminal called Qianhe (千壑). Qianhe was mountainous and impoverished, with diverse customs and dialects from ten miles to a hundred miles apart. It was a tranquil place that even the Great Li cavalry had not yet set foot in. The terminal was controlled by a cave on a nearby mountain, where the owner of Fuyin Cave was not only the national teacher of Qianhe but also the leader of the nation’s celestial masters. However, there were only a few dozen celestial masters in all of Qianhe, and its national teacher’s cultivation was only at the Longmen realm. The disciples in the cave were few, akin to stray cats and dogs, and thus they lacked any real influence. The reason they could maintain a celestial ferry was that Fuyin Cave was one of the remnants of a shattered ancient paradise, yielding several types of products that could be sold in the south, though they earned only modest profits. Even then, not many outsiders coveted this place.

Chen Ping’an intended to first return to Longquan County before heading to Caiyi Nation and Shushui Nation. There were many urgent matters at home that required his personal judgment. After all, some issues needed his direct involvement to negotiate with the Great Li court, much like the matter of purchasing a mountain. Wei Ba could assist, but he couldn’t replace Chen Ping’an in signing a new “land deed” with the Great Li.

This journey had its slight complications. A group of celestial masters from Qingfeng City were displeased that a common horse had managed to occupy a spot in the ferry’s lower deck, mingling with the exotic beasts they had meticulously raised. They found it humiliating and sought to create some trouble, albeit discreetly. Fortunately, Chen Ping’an had taken great care of his beloved horse, nicknamed “Yellow Canal” (渠黄), frequently sending his flying swords, Shiyi and Shier, to keep an eye on it and prevent any mishaps. After all, after years of companionship, Chen Ping’an was deeply grateful to this horse that seemed to share a spiritual connection with him.

So, when Yellow Canal was startled in the lower deck, Chen Ping’an immediately sensed it. He instructed Shiyi and Shier to dissipate into nothingness and penetrate the layers of the deck to reach the bottom cabin, blocking a mountain beast that had attempted to attack Yellow Canal.

When he rushed over, he was stopped by a deckhand guarding the lower level. Understanding the situation, Chen Ping’an grabbed the young man’s shoulder, half-dragging him toward where Yellow Canal was. Upon entering, the spiritual birds and beasts all trembled and lay flat on the ground, especially a beast near Yellow Canal that was pitch-black except for its snow-white paws, resembling a dog but the size of a small cow. According to texts he had purchased in the Hanging Mountain, it was a descendant of the ancient fierce beast known as the “Chasing Mountain Dog.” If it were a true Chasing Mountain Dog, it wouldn’t show mixed colors, as the breed was known for its violent temperament, similar to the Mountain-Moving Ape.

Upon seeing Chen Ping’an, that Chasing Mountain Dog descendant was even more afraid than the other docile spiritual creatures, tucking its tail and curling up.

Chen Ping’an released the deckhand, who rubbed his shoulder and smiled ingratiatingly, "This noble gentleman, it seems your horse and that beast next door have clashed in temperament. This is common on ferries. I’ll separate them and move your beloved horse to a different spot. I assure you, no more incidents will occur."

Chen Ping’an glanced at the empty barrier between Yellow Canal and the Chasing Mountain Dog descendant. 

There should have been some low-grade talismans affixed to the barrier. If the spiritual creatures crossed the line, the talismans would trigger restrictions, allowing the ferry to step in to mediate the conflict. However, the spiritual creatures brought aboard by cultivators were often imbued with intelligence and wouldn’t bring trouble to their masters. Otherwise, they would incur losses, and the misfortune would reflect upon their cultivation paths. If they got into financial troubles that couldn’t be resolved, it could lead to disaster.

However, in the eyes of the Chasing Mountain Dog descendant’s owner, a mere roadside character who could lead a horse onto a ferry was inconsequential. 

Chen Ping’an reached out and patted Yellow Canal’s head. The horse lightly stomped the ground, showing little panic.

In the mountains south of Shujian Lake, Yellow Canal had followed Chen Ping’an and seen the wide world.

Chen Ping’an withdrew his hand and chuckled, "Are you trying to ruin my path to enlightenment?" 

The deckhand was momentarily stunned, realizing that the horse’s owner might be seeking retribution but never expected it to escalate to such a degree. Did he intend to shake him down? 

This turned out well.

The young deckhand was elated, wishing for a brawl to break out between the two parties. After all, whoever stirred trouble with a cultivator from Qingfeng City would hardly escape unscathed.

The celestial masters from Qingfeng City were regular guests on this ferry, having established close relationships due to the products from Fuyin Cave. One particular type of spiritual wood, coveted by the vassal state of Fox Hill, had been monopolized by the celestial masters from Qingfeng City, who then sold it to the Xu family at a handsome profit. When asked why the Xu family didn’t make the trip themselves, the Qingfeng cultivators laughed heartily, saying the Xu family wouldn’t concern themselves with such trifles. With their business acumen, the Xu family had already made more divine money elsewhere. The Xu family in Qingfeng City, owning a Fox Hill, was accustomed to merely counting money at home.

A group of celestial masters clad in white fox fur slowly entered the lower deck, standing out conspicuously.

The fox fur from Qingfeng City not only kept one warm in winter but also cool in summer, though wearing it in summer still felt quite awkward. However, it served as a protective charm for cultivators traversing the mountains. The prestige of Qingfeng City still held considerable weight in the northern regions of Baoping Continent. Especially since the head of the Xu family had recently come into great fortune, his Dao companion had obtained a significant treasure from the Lihzhu Cave, allowing their family to amass considerable wealth. The Xu family had also secured a “peaceful and prosperous” token from Great Li, making their rise unstoppable.

Without saying a word, Chen Ping’an, looking frail and weak, stepped forward and knocked one celestial master to the ground with a single punch. Among them was a chubby-faced girl who immediately rolled her eyes and fainted. In the end, only a handsome young master remained, sweating profusely, his lips moving as he seemed torn between saying something tough or soft.

Chen Ping’an, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, stood before him and began to inquire about the internal matters of Qingfeng City.

After all, both the Xu family from Qingfeng City and the Mountain-Moving Ape from Zhengyang Mountain had old scores to settle with Chen Ping’an. Even if he traversed Shujian Lake again, he wouldn’t let either side off the hook.

Seeing his close companions and attendants lying on the ground, the pampered young cultivator abandoned any pretense of dignity. He spilled everything, like a bamboo tube pouring out beans, speaking without reservation.

The deckhand watching the scene couldn’t help but feel dazed. What was happening? Didn’t they say that cultivators from Qingfeng City were all powerful beings?

Chen Ping’an turned his head to look at the deckhand, casually slapping the forehead of the young cultivator behind him. With a thud, the latter fell backward.

This was called sharing in difficulties.

Chen Ping’an looked at the terrified deckhand and asked, "Does helping to orchestrate such schemes earn you divine money?" 

The young deckhand shook his head, stammering, "No, no! Not a single snowflake coin. I just wanted to get close to these celestial masters for future opportunities to earn money."

Chen Ping’an pressed further, "Whose idea was this?" 

The young deckhand replied without hesitation, "It was the celestial masters from Qingfeng City. I was just lending a hand. I plead for the celestial lord’s forgiveness..."

With a light stomp, the young master’s body jolted, waking him from his daze. Chen Ping’an smiled, "This brother on the ferry, you were the one who plotted against my horse. Care to explain?"

The young man from Qingfeng City exploded in anger, sitting on the ground and cursing loudly.

As Chen Ping’an exited the lower deck, he smiled at the young man, "Don’t kill anyone."

The young man struggled to stand, sneering as he approached the deckhand, "Good fellow, daring to betray me! I’ll skin you alive..." 

Suddenly, he turned to see the man in green standing at the doorway, causing him to quickly say, "Don’t worry, no killing. I wouldn’t dare—just teaching this scoundrel a lesson."

Chen Ping’an stepped out of the cabin.

Evil people have their own nemeses.

It was hard to say who was worse, the Qingfeng City cultivators or the deckhand.

However, deep down, Chen Ping’an actually loathed the frail deckhand more. In his future life, he would still have no good way to deal with these “weaklings.” Instead, he found more opportunities to confront the arrogant and domineering mountain cultivators. Just like that fateful snowy night when he crossed paths with the prince of Shihou Kingdom, Han Jingling; killing him had been easy. Perhaps in the future, he wouldn’t hesitate to eliminate a prince if he dared to step into the lawless regions of Beijulu Continent.

Chen Ping’an arrived at the bow of the ferry, holding onto the railing as he took a slow stroll.

Both Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City were thriving nowadays.

Especially the former, which had grown increasingly powerful following the demise of Li Tuanjing, the strongest figure from the five realms on Baoping Continent. Fenglei Garden was destined to enter a long period of humiliation and dormancy. If the new garden master, the sword cultivator Huang He, along with Liu Baqiao, couldn’t quickly ascend to the Nascent Soul realm, they would likely find themselves repressed by Zhengyang Mountain for hundreds of years.

As for the Xu family from Qingfeng City, they had previously sold off the mountain in Longquan County for a pittance, clearly favoring the Zhu Ying dynasty and the Guanh Lake Academy. With the situation now clear, they quickly took measures to mend their ways. According to the young cultivator, at the end of last year, they had established ties with the Yuan family, including a marriage alliance with the Yuan family’s junior branch, as well as financially supporting a cavalry unit controlled by Yuan’s descendants.

Look at that.

Whether friend or foe, everyone was busy.

On the path of enlightenment, everyone was striving to be the first.

As Chen Ping’an reflected on his own circumstances, he couldn’t help but feel some self-deprecation.

Breaking through the bottleneck of a pure martial artist at the five realms and entering the six realms had been something he could have easily accomplished before entering Shujian Lake. At that time, he was nearing his hometown and wanted to showcase his strength to the elderly man from the Luopao Mountain, who had once beaten him to the ground. After throwing over a hundred thousand punches, he had finally regained the title of the world’s strongest five-realm martial artist, thinking to make it a bit easier for the old man to train him later, thus sparing himself some suffering. Chen Ping’an wasn’t particularly concerned about the fortune of martial arts. Even if he encountered opportunities akin to the Cloud Sea Dragon from the Old Dragon City, he would still punch it away.

Little did he know that nearly three years had passed since then.

As for gathering the five elemental fated items and rebuilding the Longevity Bridge, it was best left unsaid. According to A Liang’s saying, “I have a watermelon rind sword technique, it just slides wherever it needs to go.” 

Chen Ping’an chuckled to himself.

Turning around, he saw the group of Qingfeng City cultivators come to apologize. Chen Ping’an ignored them, and once they sensed he held no grudges, they left in disappointment.

Soon after, the ferry’s owner came to apologize as well, swearing he would severely punish the troublesome deckhand.

Chen Ping’an didn’t pay much attention, simply saying it was enough that they learned their lesson.

The ferry docked at Fuyin Cave in Qianhe. In the past, Chen Ping’an would have hurried on his way, but this time he decided to visit the owner of Fuyin Cave. Perhaps having heard about the commotion on the ferry, the old cultivator at the Longmen realm, the national teacher of Qianhe, was exceptionally warm and welcoming. Chen Ping’an shamelessly asked about the rough details after the shattering of the cave paradise. The old cultivator was quite familiar with the subject, as Fuyin Cave had its own modest reputation. Though it was only about ten miles wide, the treasures and celestial relics hidden within had long been excavated by predecessors. The spiritual energy in the cave wasn’t too abundant, and only by chance did the old cultivator come to preside over the place, where he had developed it into a place for cultivation. He had a set of polished phrases for welcoming guests, sharing what he could while keeping secrets close.

Upon learning that Chen Ping’an was from Great Li, the old cultivator became even more enthusiastic, insisting that Chen Ping’an stay for a few days. Chen Ping’an declined, and in parting, the old cultivator gifted him a nine-square treasure box, intricately carved from several specialties of Fuyin Cave. The price was modest, around twenty snowflake coins in the market of Qianhe. While that was a fortune in the secular realm, it was not considered a rare gift in the eyes of mountain cultivators.

After accepting the small box, Chen Ping’an reciprocated with a jar of Honey Tail Water Well wine. Upon hearing it was the wine from Honey Tail Ferry, the old cultivator was elated, inviting Chen Ping’an to visit Fuyin Cave again whenever he passed through Qianhe. Such fine wine was scarce, but Qianhe had its own unique scenery. While it might not make cultivators linger endlessly, a single visit would surely be worthwhile. The national teacher of Qianhe was willing to accompany Chen Ping’an on a journey.

The old cultivator personally escorted Chen Ping’an to the border of Qianhe before returning home.

Beside him, a young disciple was puzzled, wondering why the master had gone to such lengths. The old cultivator sighed, “On the path of cultivation, as long as you can forge good relationships, no matter how small, do not let them slip away.”

The young disciple seemed to have gained some enlightenment, but the old cultivator, fearing his disciple would misinterpret, had to remind him, “At your age, you should focus on diligent cultivation and deepening your understanding of the Dao. Do not get too distracted by worldly matters. Understand the importance of weighing benefits and drawbacks. Wait until you’re as decrepit as your master, unable to traverse the mountain roads, before doing such things. As for the so-called master, besides imparting the Dao to you, there are also certain unavoidable matters for the sake of the disciples’ future paths.”

The old cultivator rubbed his disciple's head, sighing, “Last time you descended the mountain alone for training, I observed your foolish antics with the privileged youths of Qianhe. If not for your pretense, believing it would help you forge connections while secretly disliking it, I would have been disappointed. A cultivator should know the true foundation of their existence. Why should one care about the trivialities of worldly relationships? What significance does it hold? Remember, outside of cultivation, everything is but an illusion.”

The young disciple was shocked.

The old cultivator chuckled, “Just taking this opportunity to clear your confusion. It’s worth the twenty snowflake coins I spent.”

The young disciple made a respectful bow, “Your kindness is profound; I will surely remember it.”

The master of Fuyin Cave stroked his beard, smiling, as he walked alongside his promising disciple along the expansive mountain ridge path.

Chen Ping’an, sword on his back and riding his horse, continued north from Qianhe’s northern border.

He had no way of knowing that his visit to Fuyin Cave had inadvertently awakened a disciple of the Longmen realm old cultivator.

On a rainy day during the height of summer, Chen Ping’an, alone on horseback, presented his documents and smoothly crossed the border checkpoint into Great Li.

This time returning to Longquan County, he chose a new route, avoiding the roads of Hongzhu Town and Qidun Mountain.

Along the way, heavy rain fell, and the humid summer air was stifling, making Chen Ping’an almost mistake it for the steamy summer days of Shujian Lake.

However, summer heat gives way to autumn coolness.

At night, crickets chirped incessantly.

During this time, under an ancient pine tree on a mountain peak, he spotted a boisterous scholar with his chest bare and holding a feather fan, surrounded by beautiful maidens, their banter echoing in the air. In the distance stood two elderly figures, clearly practitioners of the Dao.

Chen Ping’an led his horse past without a sideways glance.

After leaving the mountain peak, he felt a tinge of sadness. In the past, even the most talented students of the Great Li Empire, those who could study at the mountain cliff academy, would scramble to the Guanh Lake Academy or the Great Sui and Lu dynasties. After all, the Great Li could never retain its people. According to Cui Dongshan, back then, before scholars could argue or even choose a pen, they would mention names of renowned scholars from other nations, reference works from foreign literary giants, or seek connections with acquaintances in other countries’ literary circles. Without this, they wouldn’t have the courage to speak or write.

He wondered what the current state of the scholarly world in Great Li was like.

In truth, Chen Ping’an had little interest in that.

As dusk approached, he passed several way stations on the eastern side of Longquan County before entering a small town. The wooden fence gate no longer existed; the town had constructed a stone wall, and there were no guards or soldiers at the entrance, allowing free entry and exit. After crossing the gate, Chen Ping’an found Zheng Dafeng’s thatched hut still standing alone by the road. Compared to the orderly rows of shops nearby, it stood out awkwardly, likely because he hadn’t reached an agreement on the price and was unwilling to move. The ordinary town couldn’t afford to confront the northern Longquan County government and the county office. Zheng Dafeng had nothing to fear; even a copper coin less would not suffice.

Chen Ping’an was supposed to arrive in the town after ten days but had sped up his journey, arriving much earlier.

Upon entering the checkpoint, he sent a letter to Luopao Mountain, informing them of his approximate return date.

Chen Ping’an didn’t head to the ancestral home in the mud bottle alley first. Instead, he crossed the stone bridge and visited his parents’ graves, taking out a series of cotton bags filled with soil from various places to add to the grave. It hadn’t been long since Qingming Festival, and a few faded red papers still lay on the tombstone, pressed down by a flat stone. It seemed that Pei Qian hadn’t forgotten his instructions.

Along the journey, most faces were unfamiliar, which was expected. Most of the local people had moved to the new Longquan County city in the mountains to the west, with nearly everyone living in new, bright, and spacious homes. Every household had a pair of large stone lions guarding their entrance, or at the very least, extravagant drumstones. They were no less than the past streets of Fulu and Taoye. Those who remained in the small town were mainly elderly folks reluctant to relocate, clinging to the gradually quieting alleys. Many had purchased houses but rarely showed up, and even when they did, it felt like they were speaking different languages.

Thus, Chen Ping’an returned to the town, walking down the almost unchanged mud bottle alley. However, this small alley was now deserted, with the few remaining families having moved to the new county city, selling their ancestral homes to outsiders, earning a considerable sum of money that was unimaginable. Even after purchasing a large house in the county city, it was still enough for several generations to live comfortably. The Gu family’s ancestral home had not been sold, but his mother had also settled in the county city, buying one of the largest estates there, complete with deep courtyards and flowing water—a lavish residence.

Chen Ping’an pulled out a set of keys from his belongings to unlock the courtyard gate, letting Yellow Canal roam freely within the modest yard.

He opened the door to the house, which was still the same—small and unadorned, without any significant furnishings. He moved an old long bench to sit by the table for a while. After a moment, Chen Ping’an stood up, stepped out of the courtyard, inspected the door gods and spring couplets, then re-entered the yard, looking at the character for “spring.”

As dusk deepened,

Chen Ping’an sat beside the table, lighting a lamp.

He thought he would sit for a while longer before heading to Luopao Mountain to surprise them.

However, as he sat for a while longer, he found himself reluctant to rise, wanting to linger just a bit more.

All the joys and sorrows began here. No matter how far he wandered, after years of traveling, it was only here that he could truly find peace.

After his parents had passed, Liu Xianyang often lay on this very bed, speaking of those distant dreams, and the little snot-nosed kid would frequently complain here about the adults’ unreasonable behavior.

When parents are not far away, one must travel with purpose. Now that they were gone, one must still travel with purpose.

In the not-so-distant Hongzhu Town, Pei Qian sat on a high rooftop with the young boy in a green shirt and the young girl in a pink skirt, eagerly looking into the distance, betting on which of them would spot that familiar figure first.

On Luopao Mountain, the Barefoot Elder was resting with closed eyes on the second floor.

Zhu Lian began to repeatedly admire the talismanic inscriptions on the bamboo towers.

The ghost girl, Shi Rou, sat on a bamboo chair under the eaves, feeling utterly bored and out of place since arriving at Luopao Mountain.

Atop the peak of Piyun Mountain, the North Mountain Deity of Great Li, Wei Ba, stood alongside an old dragon from Huangting Nation, one smiling leisurely and the other with a solemn expression.

They looked down at the small town in the distance.

In a narrow alley, a single flame flickered.

It shone brightly.

(End of Chapter)
