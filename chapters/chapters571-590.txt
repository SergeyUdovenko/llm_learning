 ### Chapter 571: Good Brother (Part One)

Chen Ping'an didn't head directly to the mountain where the Great Sage of Moving Mountains resided. Instead, he took a slight detour to visit the Yao-catching Immortal at the Narrow Goat Palace.

Though it was called a palace, it was hardly better than the dilapidated temple at the foot of Baojing Mountain, resembling a three-entry courtyard more akin to that of Longquan County. 

At the entrance, two little spirits guarded the door, each cradling a wooden spear, chatting idly on the steps. One of them, a mouse spirit, even had a tattered book resting on its knee.

Chen Ping'an didn't bother with any illusions or deceptive formations. The Yao-catching Immortal was likely still at the Great Sage's mountain, discussing how to intercept and deal with him.

As the two spirits caught sight of an old man in a blue robe approaching their door, one muscular mouse spirit rubbed its eyes and sniffed, "Is that a real person? Am I dreaming?"

The other, smaller mouse spirit hurriedly tucked away its book, looking a bit uncertain, before suddenly standing up with its wooden spear held high, shouting, "How dare you trespass into our Narrow Goat Palace! State your name, and I might spare your life!"

Chen Ping'an's voice was hoarse as he replied, "I’m here on behalf of the Summer Queen of Falling Leaves Mountain, inviting the Yao-catching Immortal to be our guest at the Guanghan Palace. Where is your Immortal? Hurry up! My Queen just captured a scholar from the City of Copper Stench."

The mouse spirit at the door drooled and rushed over eagerly, "Really?"

The other little mouse spirit, however, remained skeptical, pointing its spear at Chen Ping'an and poking him twice, "My ancestor said that the Summer Queen is a greedy woman who loves to hog things for herself. Don't you dare lie!"

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "To be honest, my Queen has something she needs help with. She hopes to summon the Yao-catching Immortal to assist against a young sword immortal who's been causing a ruckus at the mountain top."

The drooling mouse spirit whispered, "It must be that formidable sword immortal my ancestor mentioned. Falling Leaves Mountain is close to Copper Official Mountain, so we are bound to be the first to get into trouble."

The spear-wielding mouse spirit pondered for a moment and nodded, "Alright then, you can return to Falling Leaves Mountain. I’ll go inform my ancestor immediately; I won’t delay your Queen’s request."

The other mouse spirit seemed anxious, quickly making eye contact.

This frail old man, though aged, was still just a living person. If they could catch him, it wouldn’t be difficult to deal with him. Killing him and then reporting back to their ancestor wouldn’t take long. Since Falling Leaves Mountain needed their assistance, losing a messenger wouldn’t matter. Surely, the Summer Queen wouldn't dare to make a fuss about it. Wouldn't they be able to enjoy a nice meal then?

The mouse spirit seemed to miss the point entirely, poking Chen Ping'an with the spear again, "Are you going to leave or not? My ancestor isn’t someone you can just see whenever you want! You’re just asking for trouble!"

Chen Ping'an noticed that the mouse spirit was signaling to him to leave quickly.

Meanwhile, the other mouse spirit had secretly pulled out a sharpened dagger from its sleeve, hiding it behind its back as it approached Chen Ping'an, smiling, "It’s no harm to meet my ancestor; our Narrow Goat Palace is always welcoming to guests."

Chen Ping'an merely stared into the anxious eyes of the mouse spirit, then extended a finger and flicked it lightly. The mouse spirit's forehead burst open, blood splattering as it fell backward, dead on the steps of the Narrow Goat Palace.

The remaining mouse spirit stood there, dazed, before panic set in, and it turned to flee.

But it was stopped by a firm hand on its shoulder. The mouse spirit couldn't move, its mind a blank, staring at its comrade lying in a pool of blood, unable to comprehend why its fellow had died so abruptly.

Its ancestor had once said it had the potential to become a great monster. The ancestor had always favored it, promising that once the Narrow Goat Palace expanded, they would build a residence as grand as the Guanghan Palace, and it would be appointed as the resident master. Unlike the ancestor, which often punished it, they would sometimes reward it with delicacies from feasts at other mountain peaks, teaching it a set of blade techniques.

Chen Ping'an dragged the mouse spirit to sit beside the steps, taking the tattered book from its sleeve. It was a badly damaged literary notebook, and flipping it open revealed even more amusing content, with some crooked annotations written in fine charcoal. It was clear the writer took great care, even if the handwriting was like a worm’s crawl. The annotations were often short, featuring childish questions and some flattering phrases.

Chuckling to himself, Chen Ping'an closed the book and handed it back to the trembling little mouse spirit, whose face had turned ghostly pale.

"Do you know where the Yao-catching Immortal's treasure is hidden?" Chen Ping'an asked.

The little mouse spirit, stiff and shaking, took the book with quivering hands and stammered, "I don’t know... even if I did, I wouldn’t tell you... I’d rather die than say."

Chen Ping'an couldn't help but laugh, extending his hand to reveal a brand new book, still carrying the scent of ink. "Remember to hide this well; it’s best to dig a hole and bury it. If the Yao-catching Immortal returns and finds this Narrow Goat Palace, you’ll be dead. Your ancestor has sharp instincts; I almost got discovered myself."

The little mouse spirit stared at him, dumbfounded.

Chen Ping'an placed the book in its hands, "Got it?"

The little mouse spirit nodded blankly.

"Move quickly, hide the book, and then let me knock you out. Of course, it's fine if you knock your own head against the door until you pass out. As for escaping, don’t even think about it."

The little mouse spirit dropped its spear and hurried to dig a hole, hiding the book. 

It returned to the steps, hesitating for a moment before slamming itself into the door, resulting in a loud thud as it fell back, still conscious, and pitifully turned to Chen Ping'an. "Sir Immortal, you might as well do it; drawing some blood would actually be better."

With a flick of his sleeve, Chen Ping'an knocked it out, blood trickling slowly from its seven orifices, though it looked far worse than it actually was.

Chen Ping'an kicked open the door to the Narrow Goat Palace, stepping over the threshold, beginning his search for the Yao-catching Immortal’s treasure.

He tapped the Sword-raising Gourd, calling for the First and Fifteenth to help him seek clues.

Eventually, under the incense table in the main hall of the Narrow Goat Palace, he pried open a wooden board, discovering a narrow secret passage. Compared to the spacious tunnel of Falling Leaves Mountain, this one was cramped and tight, forcing Chen Ping'an to crawl inside, allowing the First to lead the way. After about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, they finally arrived at a dim cave that could barely fit one person standing. Chen Ping'an lit a firecracker, only to find a single iron chest, crooked and covered in talismans. The talismans were infused with spiritual energy, indicating they were frequently replaced, but it wasn’t clear whether these prohibitions were meant to alert the owner or if triggering them would invoke an attack from the talismans.

Chen Ping'an stepped back, letting the First and Fifteenth take over, while he held his breath, ready for any surprises.

Two flying swords whizzed through the air, circling the iron chest, quickly severing the yellow paper talismans, ruining their protective spells.

After a violent disturbance of spiritual energy, nothing more unusual happened. When Chen Ping'an opened the iron chest, he found himself at a loss for words; it contained not magical artifacts or divine money, but rather stacks of books.

Well, in this Ghostly Abyss Valley, books were indeed a rarity.

Flipping open one of the ancient tomes, he discovered it was a book on military strategy.

It appeared that the Yao-catching Immortal was quite the enthusiast for studying warfare.

Suddenly, with a snap of his fingers, Chen Ping'an caught a centipede that had lunged at him, its dark, glossy body vibrating violently from the impact, killing it on the spot.

After hesitating for a moment, he couldn’t afford the time to meticulously peruse the military texts, so he collected them all into his pouch. After searching around to ensure there were no more hidden treasures, he retraced his steps back to the Narrow Goat Palace.

The Yao-catching Immortal was truly a pauper.

Next, Chen Ping'an still didn’t head to the Great Sage’s mountain but instead made his way to the farthest north, to Jixiao Mountain.

That was the territory of the Thunder Command General.

This monster preferred solitude, unlike the Great Sage of Moving Mountains and the Black River King, who enjoyed gathering followers. However, when it came to combat prowess, this one was the most formidable among the six saints.

Jixiao Mountain was enveloped in thunderclouds year-round, with lightning interwoven. Both spirits and ghosts instinctively feared thunder, making it an extremely unpopular spot in the Ghostly Abyss Valley. Yet, this monster had somehow acquired a fragment of a thunder method and had cultivated it to the point where it had lost hearing in both ears and one of its eyes had exploded. Still, it had managed to develop some thunder magic, spewing fire from its nose and smoke from its mouth, summoning thunder and lightning with every move.

A resilient creature with decent magical abilities, the thunder methods worked inherently against spirits and monsters, granting this Thunder Command General a unique status among the six saints.

There were no trails on Jixiao Mountain; the place was nearly devoid of life.

The sea of clouds swirled around halfway up the mountain, filled with electric flashes and thunderclaps, and the view of the higher peaks was completely obscured.

Chen Ping'an flew upward, leaping among the rocks.

Suddenly, he stopped, noticing that the area around Di Yong Mountain was ablaze with brilliant lights and continuous roars.

Had that scholar entered a den of thieves?

Chen Ping'an quickened his pace.

As he neared the thunderclouds at the mid-mountain, bolts of lightning lashed out towards him.

He dispersed them with a series of punches, scattering no less than a hundred bolts in half an incense stick's time. With his arms feeling numb, Chen Ping'an finally gained a clear view.

Above Jixiao Mountain, a heavier sea of clouds gathered, with golden lightning striking down like columns, creating a tremendous roar that shook the eardrums.

Even Chen Ping'an felt dizzy for a moment. After taking a deep breath, he continued to scale the mountain.

Approaching the summit, the lightning formed a cage, preventing him from getting close. Chen Ping'an could only soar on his sword.

Standing atop the sword of a celestial swordsman, he gazed down, only to find a thunder pool the size of a small pond. The plasma within it was thick as water, frothing like snowflakes.

A slightly tilted stone tablet bore the inscription "Doushu Courtyard Sword Washing Pool" in large characters, all in ancient script from the "True Records of Alchemy."

The stone tablet was certainly not a mundane object; otherwise, it wouldn't have withstood so many years of thunder and lightning strikes, merely leaning without a hint of damage or even a crack.

Chen Ping'an stopped his sword.

He knew well that this thunder pool was a coveted treasure among the sects of immortals.

Yet, he had no idea how to approach it.

As for whether the thunder pool contained any rare treasures, that remained an enigma.

Chen Ping'an was completely unaware of what "Doushu Courtyard" meant and had no inkling about the true secrets of thunder methods. 

Unlike Yang Chongxuan, who could wait patiently for opportunities, Chen Ping'an guarding the stream could end up waiting fruitlessly for hundreds of years.

He glanced at the golden lightning above the thunder pool, weighing his own resilience; perhaps he could endure for a moment. He might even leap into the pool, but he worried that entering would be easier than exiting. If some unknown prohibition was triggered, and the might of the lightning surged, he couldn't imagine the consequences.

Looking up, could he send the sword immortal to disrupt the sea of clouds, forcing the thunder pool to lose its "reinforcements"?

The sword immortal beneath him was eager to try, trembling slightly, as if itching for a chance to confront the tumultuous thunder and lightning.

Chen Ping'an's face was filled with conflict.

The existence of this thunder pool atop Jixiao Mountain, untouched for so long, was likely beyond the capabilities of both the Pumiao Sect and Jinguan City. They were ultimately spirits of ghostly origins, not true celestial beings.

As for the cultivators from Beiju Luzhou outside, they would find it impossible to simply take away this "sword washing pool" right under the nose of the Ghostly Abyss Valley.

Whether the Pumiao Sect had ever coveted the thunder pool or merely lacked the ability to do so was anyone's guess.

It’s worth noting that Jixiao Mountain was not far from Qingshan Town.

The sect leader of Pumiao, Zhu Quan, was hardly one to be intimidated by the likes of Pumiao or Jinguan City. If he had the means, he would not have been hesitant to act.

Thus, the possibility of relocating the thunder pool was slim.

Washing swords? 

Was it to temper blades and sharpen their edge?

However, whether it was the sword immortal or the flying swords, neither showed any eagerness about the thunder pool, especially the First, who was unusually quiet.

Chen Ping'an let out a soft sigh.

He hoped that if Falling Leaves Mountain truly established a sect in the future, when disciples like Pei Qian, Cen Yuanji, or even those of lower rank went out exploring and encountered such innate treasures or fortuitous lands, they wouldn't be as helpless as he had been. They could rely on the vast collection of books and legacies from Falling Leaves Mountain and the surrounding peaks to be informed about worldly matters and seize opportunities as much as possible.

Looking around, Chen Ping'an noticed that beneath the thunder pool on Jixiao Mountain, apart from the lifeless vegetation, there were a few rocky cliffs flickering under the illumination of lightning.

He descended to one of the cliffs and discovered a slender golden vein the length of his arm. When he reached out to touch it, not only did it send a bone-deep pain shooting through him, but it also caused his spirit to tremble.

Chen Ping'an was taken aback, drawing out his sword to begin cutting and excavating the "vein" from the cliff. Ultimately, he extracted it into a hollow, where it lay quietly, resembling a golden bamboo whip, with golden light swirling within.

Once he grasped this golden whip, it felt like fire burning in his palm. After a moment, Chen Ping'an released it, drenched in sweat and feeling somewhat dizzy.

Wiping the sweat from his brow, he hastily stored the golden whip in his pouch.

He took to the skies again, searching for the next location of the "bamboo whip" that contained the true essence of thunder methods.

Circling Jixiao Mountain at its peak, he found only four places glowing with golden light, repeatedly descending like a diligent farmer digging up various sizes of bamboo whips. The smallest was only the length of his finger, while the longest was over half his height. If he could refine it, it could make a stout walking stick.

After another round of searching, confirming no more golden light or veins, he finally hurriedly descended, passing through the sea of clouds, dispersing the chaotic lightning strikes, and successfully made it down Jixiao Mountain.

Chen Ping'an sheathed his sword, looking up at the thunder pool with a sense of regret. Yet, the five golden lightning whips in his pouch made him feel a bit more cheerful.

Gaining and losing? 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, silently saying, "Forgotten? If it’s not yours, don’t dwell on it."

Turning his gaze toward Di Yong Mountain, he noticed even greater commotion, with the lights of magical artifacts bursting forth in the skies.

In the depths of his heart, it felt as if a voice echoed.

Kill him.

The voice was devoid of emotion, neither happy nor sad, good nor evil.

But it shook Chen Ping'an to the core, filling him with dread.

That "him," he was certain, referred to the scholar.

After closing his eyes for a moment, Chen Ping'an opened them again, his gaze clear, free from any trace of hesitation, and he flew swiftly toward Di Yong Mountain.

To kill or to save.

Both were better than fleeing.

This was the third time he had heard this voice rising from somewhere unknown.

The first time was when he was young, returning to Mud Bottle Alley after descending the mountain, rolling on the ground.

That time, it had also been three words: his heart thundering as if a drum sounded, a divine voice roaring.

You cannot die.

In the realm of Baijing Mountain.

A young man in tattered clothes was full of youthful vigor.

Beside him stood a goddess who had stepped out from the Tian Guan mural of the City of Wall Paintings.

This goddess, so high above, did not walk alongside him but always lagged just a step behind.

Upholding the distinction of rank!

She was the Rain Summoning Goddess!

Not only that, she told him her name was Shu Shi and had no surname. Within the decade, she would do her utmost to help him cultivate and rise.

The young man relished the attention he garnered, stepping out from the City of Wall Paintings until the Rain Summoning Goddess informed him of an opportunity belonging to him in the Ghostly Abyss Valley. Passing through the archway, everyone looked at him, all gazing up in admiration.

He was no longer that pitiful creature, burdened with blood vendettas, crying out to the heavens and receiving no response.

Suddenly, he felt that the weight of his grievances had lessened after being followed and served by the Rain Summoning Goddess.

This goddess, who called herself Shu Shi, informed him that her current battle strength was equivalent to a Golden Core practitioner, but in terms of defense and survival, she could be regarded as at the Nascent Soul level.

This filled him with confidence, so even when she candidly warned him about the uncertain fortunes of opportunities at Baijing Mountain, he remained resolute, believing that fortune would come his way—he was destined to conquer.

Along the way, he asked her questions, and she answered without reservation.

The only thing she remained tight-lipped about was the identity of the young woman who had stood beneath the mural.

As they drew closer to Baijing Mountain, the Rain Summoning Goddess suddenly halted, her expression grave. She looked up toward the mid-mountain, slowly conveying through her thoughts, “This opportunity may not be a good one, Jiang Qujiang. I hope you will consider it carefully.”

A glimmer of surprise flashed across the young man's face, but he quickly steeled his resolve, gritting his teeth, “Heaven owes me so much; it's about time they pay some interest!”

Deep within the goddess, a soft sigh escaped. 

As they passed a dilapidated pavilion, the old fox from Xishan, holding a cane, reappeared.

Ignoring the young man, who bore a striking resemblance to Yang the Beggar, the old fox fixated on the ethereal goddess, glaring at her. How could there exist someone who could match his daughter's beauty? Why didn’t she just go die? She should hurry up and fall into the Soul Binding Stream halfway up the mountain and drown!

The old fox suddenly noticed a detail and smiled, asking, “This goddess, are you and your young master planning to ascend the mountain?”

The Rain Summoning Goddess saw right through the old fox's cunning.

Jiang Qujiang smiled faintly.

 ### Chapter 572: Good Man Brother (Part Two)

The Old Fox of West Mountain felt the situation was clear to him.

Indeed, this was a foolishly naive big fish, much easier to deal with than that treacherous rascal with the bamboo hat from before. 

However, since it was like this, even if this silly boy seemed to have stumbled upon good fortune, what ordinary down-on-their-luck cultivator could attract such an exceptionally beautiful woman? Moreover, how could they safely reach Treasure Mirror Mountain? Well then, why not let his daughter be this boy's legitimate wife, and let that woman be a concubine... or perhaps a maid would be better!

Old Fox of West Mountain chuckled, “Young Sir, you may not know, but I am the local deity of Treasure Mirror Mountain, and my daughter is the River Goddess from the deep ravine above. If you wish to gain fortune here, you must have our father-daughter pair involved; otherwise, it would be impossible! Just wait a moment, I’ll call my daughter over. A person like you, a phoenix among men, should certainly seize such fortune. If fortune has a spirit, it should leap right into your arms; otherwise, it would be against the natural order, wouldn’t it? Just wait, I’ll be right back. My daughter is a beauty to rival the heavens, and she admires dashing young men like you…”

Jiang Qujiang felt a bit dazed.

The Rain Goddess asked, “Are you really going to search for treasure on the mountain?”

Jiang Qujiang furrowed his brow. Was this her third reminder? 

He quietly asked, “Shushi, if these fortunes are fraught with peril, since you excel in divination, how likely is it that fortune will turn to misfortune?”

The goddess replied, “It’s a bit strange. When we left the Mural City, the fortune-to-misfortune ratio was nine to one. At the entrance of the Ghostly Valley, it changed to seven to three, and now it’s an even five to five.”

Jiang Qujiang looked at the usually cold Rain Goddess, who was now slightly furrowing her brow, revealing a captivating charm. He felt a moment of distraction, but the hardships he had endured while fleeing made him quickly regain his composure. He smiled, “Five to five? That’s already quite good! Let’s go up the mountain!”

Once, for the sake of a family heirloom jade pendant, their family had been targeted by the mountain’s immortal masters. Their home had faced disaster, and he was the only one left of a once-prominent family. He had fled south, determined to die at Mural City’s bone-strewn cliffs if it came to that, all for the sake of that slim chance—a mere chance!

Soon, Old Fox of West Mountain returned with his daughter, Wei Taizhen, who held a small green parasol.

Upon seeing the young man, the fox-girl was struck as if hit by lightning, her pretty face flushed.

Even she found it strange.

The Old Fox of West Mountain felt a surge of delight—this was promising!

The young man, seeing his daughter, was also momentarily dazed. 

Ah, this boy was a bit dim. 

But then the Old Fox thought, what a huge blessing this was! A future son-in-law who was a bit foolish yet wealthy was certainly better than that crafty rascal in the bamboo hat. 

He was just afraid of comparison; looking at the young man again, he found him more pleasing to the eye.

At that moment, a burly young man rushed over, grabbing both the Old Fox and Wei Taizhen, shaking his head vigorously, “No! Don’t go! Yang Chongxuan might be waiting for today! Those fateful words given to my sister by that wandering Daoist years ago may not be a good thing! The cultivators on that mountain are all deeply calculating…”

Old Fox of West Mountain exploded in anger, wrenching free from the young man’s grip and kicking him away, “Don’t waste your sister’s lifetime happiness here!”

Wei Gaowu struggled to rise, wanting to prevent his sister from ascending the mountain, but the Old Fox tossed his wooden staff, hitting him on the forehead. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed, voice faint as a mosquito, “You can’t go up the mountain…”

The Rain Goddess looked at Old Fox of West Mountain and the infatuated girl holding a parasol.

For some reason, she felt a sense of detachment, as if she were looking down upon them without a ripple of emotion.

Did the young woman standing under the mural view her the same way?

Who was she, really? 

Why did she inspire such awe in herself? It felt like an instinctive fear.

Both parties began their ascent.

Jiang Qujiang, despite his attempts at restraint, couldn’t help but steal glances at the girl.

She was breathtakingly beautiful.

Behind him, the Rain Goddess named Shushi made him feel inadequate, stirring a desire to admire from a distance without intrusion. 

But this girl with the green parasol was different. 

She constantly evoked sympathy, causing his heart to race.

On the other side of the ravine, Yang Chongxuan stood up, his gaze fiery as he slowly said, “Very good, a mediocre goddess from Mural City is just right for practice.”

No longer displaying any nonchalance, Yang Chongxuan’s bones cracked like firecrackers. 

A mighty surge of energy cascaded down his body like a waterfall.

In the next moment, the intent of his fist coalesced like a grain of mustard seed, and Yang Chongxuan sat back down on the white stone cliff, returning to his lazy demeanor from these past years.

The fox-girl bore an ancient inheritance of restrictions, as foretold in a traditional prophecy: “Seeing the hairpin open the door, holding the pearl to ascend.”

Once she encountered the one destined for her, her heart would awaken. When a man saw the hairpin, the fox-girl would see him, and one of her eyes would become the key to unlocking the deep ravine.

At that time, Yang Chongxuan would extract that eye and ascend Treasure Mirror Mountain. Since it was a Three Mountain Mirror, the entrance was not at the bottom of the deep ravine but at the peak of Treasure Mirror Mountain. How could the lord of Jingguan City find the method to retrieve the mirror from the waters below? This great secret was a chance passed down through generations in their Yunxiao Palace. Even though a grandmaster of the Fifth Realm from his family had learned of the prophecy a millennium ago, he could only wait—and died without discovering it. It wasn’t that their ancestors hadn’t tried to forcefully obtain the treasure; they simply couldn’t manage it. Subsequent attempts by Xiangci City to move mountains were secretly orchestrated by Yunxiao Palace, but alas, it was all in vain. Some great fortunes in this world are simply unreasonable.

Because of the prophecy, and the phrase “gaining treasure from the mountain,” the Yang family, who had been ministers for generations, could never decipher it. It wasn’t until he and his brother were born, displaying an innate affinity for the mountains, that the palace finally realized.

Yang Chongxuan sat cross-legged, resting his chin on one hand, watching with anticipation.

On the opposite side, the jubilant Old Fox of West Mountain.

The fox-girl Wei Taizhen, unaware of the peril she was in, was about to have her eye extracted, which would mean losing her spirit completely—how could she survive that?

Jiang Qujiang wore a smile.

The Rain Goddess’s expression was heavy.

Yang Chongxuan wore a faint smile.

Even if it were the skilled killing goddess of Mural City, what of it?

He had once risen from the strongest Sixth Realm to the Body of a Martial Artist.

The Rain Goddess hesitated to speak.

Jiang Qujiang stood at the riverside, looking down at the ravine. He spotted a glimmer of gold slowly floating up from the water below, gradually becoming clearer—it was indeed a hairpin! He pointed, “Is that the golden hairpin?”

The girl, Wei Taizhen, covered her mouth, tears shimmering in her eyes, on the verge of crying, looking utterly pitiful. 

It was him!

He was her destined prince charming.

Suddenly, the girl felt a sharp pain and instinctively blinked. One of her lively eyes began to gather golden light, drawing energy from all parts of her body. She winced in pain, covering half her face with her hand, cold sweat pouring down, blood seeping through her fingers.

Though the girl appeared delicate, she had a stubborn nature and an intense temper. Gritting her teeth, she squatted down, refusing to say a word, even as pain made her tremble.

What woman in this world would want to show such a pitiful sight to the man she fell for at first sight?

Yang Chongxuan looked around, disappointed to find that the big fool was nowhere to be seen.

When he stood up, Jiang Qujiang and Old Fox of West Mountain both instinctively took a step back.

As if a grand mountain were pressing down upon them.

Finally, the Rain Goddess spoke, “We don’t want this chance; you can take it for yourself!”

As Yang Chongxuan stopped repressing his energy, the entire ravine began to tremble.

Stretching his arms and yawning, he fixed his gaze on the so-called goddess, sneering, “That depends on my mood!”

The Rain Goddess fixed her gaze on the dangerous man across the ravine, saying in a low voice, “You all should leave; don’t hesitate! The farther, the better. Go straight to Qinglu Town!”

“Just run!” 

Yang Chongxuan laughed loudly, “I’d like to see whether my fists are faster or their legs!”

The Rain Goddess raised her hand gently, and the waters of the deep ravine surged as if commanded. Suddenly, the water erupted, forming an ice wall over ten feet high right between her and Yang Chongxuan.

Fortunately, they were fighting near the water, giving her the advantage.

With a single punch, he shattered the water wall.

The goddess brought her fingers together, gently tracing the source of the ravine, transforming it into a water dragon that leaped toward Yang Chongxuan in mid-air.

Yang Chongxuan stood firm in the air, extending a hand. His aura surged, colliding with the water dragon, both dissipating. Under the sunlight, a rainbow appeared halfway up Treasure Mirror Mountain.

As Yang Chongxuan took a step forward, preparing to cross to the other side, the Rain Goddess retreated a step, rotating her hands to reveal a large, clear water mirror the size of a well in front of her. Ancient golden inscriptions appeared around the mirror's edge.

Yang Chongxuan laughed heartily and lunged forward, throwing a punch. However, the water mirror didn’t shatter; instead, he found himself enveloped in a misty illusion.

Yang Chongxuan sneered, “Well, you do know some tricks, but don’t you know my surname? In terms of talismans and formations, my Yang family is the true lineage in the Northern Julu Continent!”

Damn it, just thinking of this made Yang Chongxuan recall Liu Jinglong, filling him with rage. He decided not to use his family’s techniques to break the formation but instead spun around, unleashing punches in all directions, sending shockwaves outward. Yang Chongxuan laughed, “Let’s see how long you can maintain this illusion!”

Yang Chongxuan was like a madman descending upon the world, his overwhelming aura far beyond that of an ordinary martial artist at the Golden Body level.

By the banks of the ravine, Jiang Qujiang watched as the Rain Goddess stepped slowly into the water. The water mirror shook and shattered, only to be continuously repaired by her deep ravine waters. 

The Rain Goddess struggled with all her might, her heart heavy. She no longer wished for the other three to leave Treasure Mirror Mountain, for she was certain they would not escape their fate.

Even if they left Treasure Mirror Mountain, that madman would still chase them down.

The outcome was already sealed.

Even with the immense energy drawn from the deep ravine, she could only hold out for a short while, even less than half a stick of incense.

Jiang Qujiang’s face turned pale; he murmured, “How could this be? It shouldn’t be like this.”

Old Fox of West Mountain finally noticed his daughter’s dire state, crouching beside her in vain. The old fox was anxious and began to regret not heeding that foolish boy’s words.

Yang Chongxuan stood still within the water mirror illusion. “I’m done playing.”

Taking a deep breath, he assumed a fighting stance reminiscent of an ancient god, preparing to cleave the river—a stance he had realized from a family martial arts illustration in his youth.

The water mirror shattered explosively, like a glass lamp hitting the ground, scattering everywhere.

The Rain Goddess had no choice but to switch her techniques, harnessing the deep ravine waters to form a suit of armor around herself, attempting to slow Yang Chongxuan’s advance as much as possible.

In an instant, he had closed the distance, punching through her abdomen, slowly withdrawing his arm. Then, he reached out to grab her head, throwing it to the ground and finally stepping on her forehead, looking down with a chuckle, “No wonder you’re a goddess; your blood is actually golden, just like those mountain and water deities. Typically, a deity that takes my punch should shatter, yes indeed. Once I obtain the mirror, I’ll let you recover your energy, and we can continue our fight. Don’t worry, after I finish my business, I’ll slow down my punches and ease my strength a little; it wouldn’t do to end this too quickly. A man should take his time!”

Yang Chongxuan’s words were polite, yet he suddenly increased the pressure of his foot, pressing the Rain Goddess’s entire head into the white stone cliff, preventing her from drawing upon the deep ravine's energy.

Yang Chongxuan bent down, smiling, “If you keep delaying my business, I might have to break your neck.”

The Rain Goddess struggled desperately, her fingers twitching as she still tried to draw energy from the deep ravine.

The nine goddesses from Mural City, once they stepped out of their paintings, were resolute when it came to life and death, never complaining.

Just as Yang Chongxuan was about to deal with this goddess, a voice echoed from the peak of Treasure Mirror Mountain.

“Truly a waste of space.”

Yang Chongxuan looked up, pointing at himself, “Are you talking about me?”

A not particularly beautiful, fragile-looking girl, with a lion seal hanging from her waist, leaped down from the mountain peak.

Yang Chongxuan’s mind raced as he was about to crush the Rain Goddess beneath him.

The young woman smiled, “I advise you not to do that.”

Even after witnessing Yang Chongxuan’s incredible close-combat skills, the girl still walked slowly toward him.

Not only that, but she also, right in front of Yang Chongxuan, flicked her fingers twice, sending Jiang Qujiang and Old Fox of West Mountain flying away.

She cast a sidelong glance at the Rain Goddess, who was in a sorry state, her eyes filled with mockery, “The Spring King’s first month, torrential rains shake the heavens, Shushi as well. Such a waste of a good name.”

Yang Chongxuan was astonished, retracting his strength from his foot, asking, “Who are you?”

The girl replied, “Li Liu.”

Yang Chongxuan rubbed his chin, “I’ve never heard of you.”

Li Liu smiled enigmatically, “Regarding the prophecy of this mirror, I told your family’s founding ancestor. Back then, he was still wearing split pants, and your Yang family was poor. That boy’s pants were patched up, hiding nothing.”

Yang Chongxuan burst into laughter, nearly shedding tears. 

Damn it, he’d never heard such a funny joke in his life.

Li Liu laughed as well, her eyes crescent-shaped, gentle and beautiful.

Suddenly, Yang Chongxuan thought of someone.

He stopped laughing.

Tentatively, he asked, “The Fourth? But the one who has given Liu Jinglong a headache?”

The girl tilted her head, smiling with her eyes closed, and replied, “Liu Jinglong? Never heard of him.”

Yang Chongxuan’s eyes widened.

Oh boy, this girl was something else, even better at playing coy than he was—just his type!

But Yang Chongxuan was a bit uneasy. Before he stepped into the Golden Body realm, a wise elder had given him a warning: in the next ten years, be careful, he would be hurt by a woman.

At the time, he thought he was just going to be a casualty of romance, which made him flinch at the sight of beautiful women.

After all, he was still half a cultivator; once caught in a love calamity, it could be quite troublesome.

But that warning—could it be that he was destined to be harmed by this girl before him?

They were only five steps apart when she finally stopped.

She said, “Killing you seems a bit difficult; the cost would be too great.”

It seemed she was in distress.

Yang Chongxuan, however, was on high alert.

Even when facing the elder from the Little Xuan Guo, he had never felt this level of vigilance. 

Not long after Chen Ping’an quietly infiltrated the territory of the Earthspring Mountain, an outsider from Liuxia Continent, along with the goddess who first transformed colorful murals into sketches, left Mural City together. They first visited the Patriarch Hall of the Pima Sect, drank a bowl of dark tea, and had a pleasant discussion with one of the three ancient elders of the Pima Sect. Then, with the help of the Pima Sect’s secret techniques, they directly reached Qinglu Town. After a brief exploration, the goddess felt a stirring in her heart and requested the master to visit Jixiao Mountain.

According to the predictions of the Spring Goddess, if the fortunes of Treasure Mirror Mountain were a meeting gift prepared by the Rain Goddess for the master, then the miniature Thunder Pool on Jixiao Mountain was the goddess’s own possession.

Though it could not compare in scale or quality to the Thunder Pool of the Upside-Down Mountain, it was still a tremendous fortune akin to a half-immortal artifact. 

Simultaneously, the Spring Goddess had predicted the fortunes of both locations, and whether it was the mirror of Treasure Mirror Mountain or the Thunder Pool, once grasped, there would be further great opportunities to follow—that was the true key.

However, the specifics were shrouded in mystery, just like their true identities, surrounded by layers of obstacles that couldn’t be unraveled.

The two who had become partners rode the wind together.

The goddess of the brush was candid, smiling, “I’m much luckier than that Rain Sister of mine. She’s stuck with such a low-minded character for sixty years; if it were me, I’d be frustrated to death. That young man is worlds apart from you, Master.”

The man, feeling helpless, replied gently, “Huo Ling, don’t compare yourself to others; since ancient times, those who conquer themselves are better than those who conquer others.”

The brush goddess nodded with a smile, “Got it, Master.”

As they neared Jixiao Mountain, she was filled with unexplainable joy. Just a glance at the sea of clouds swirling halfway up the mountain made her happy, and another look at the clouds at the summit brought even more delight. 

She grabbed the man’s hand, soaring above the sea of clouds, where the lightning was surprisingly gentle, showing no aggression towards them, instead playfully bouncing on the surface of the cloud sea, displaying a friendly demeanor.

Near the peak of Jixiao Mountain, the two hovered in the air. The brush goddess pointed at a stone tablet at the mountain's summit, smiling, “Master, do you recognize those characters?”

The man glanced at it, nodding, “The Sword Washing Pool of the Fighting Pivot Academy, a significant site for ancient Thunder Department gods to cleanse weapons. The Fighting Pivot Academy belongs to one of the four offices of the two courtyards and three divisions. I once dreamt of wandering through the ruins of the two courtyards and one division, but after waking, I couldn’t remember the scenes clearly; I only felt it was quite mysterious.”

The brush goddess was overjoyed.

She glanced down and suddenly frowned.

The man asked in confusion, “What’s wrong?”

The brush goddess, filled with killing intent, said, “Master, several Thunder Whips are missing! I don’t know which thief stole them or if some monster has taken over this place!”

The man shook his head, “Since it’s a fortune, whether someone stole it or a monster occupied it, it’s all fated; there’s no need to be angry.”

The brush goddess pouted, then suddenly smiled, gently taking out a small ancient inkstone engraved with “Lightning” from her waist and tossing it forward.

At the peak of Jixiao Mountain, a magnificent scene unfolded.

The entire Thunder Pool soared up, along with the cloud sea and lightning, plunging into the inkstone.

About a moment later, the brush goddess lightly called out, “Come back.”

The ancient inkstone flew back into her hand, presenting it to the man, “Master, please take a look.”

The man gazed down at the ancient inkstone, which held a Thunder Pool like a pool of golden ink.

It was indeed wondrous.

He instructed her to put away the ancient inkstone and looked into the distance, “It’s time to return home.”

The brush goddess teasingly said, “Does this count as returning home in style? Then you need to thank me! How should you thank me? It’s simple; I’ve heard that the sky in Liuxia Continent is exceptionally high, with all five thunders present. Master just needs to take me out for a good meal!”

The man chuckled, finding her unexpectedly playful.

In the Earthspring Mountain area.

A scholar was being chased by a group of Golden Core monsters, fleeing in disarray. There were even Golden Core ghostly beings temporarily controlling the Earthspring Mountain’s protective formation, willing to shatter the mountain’s base and ruin the water flow to forcibly secure the barriers below and above, preventing the scholar from escaping with his strange evasion techniques. If it were just this level of magic, the scholar could have fled long ago, but unexpectedly, the Golden Core ghostly being from the named Baijiang City had an extraordinary treasure that could attach itself to the scholar, causing no harm to his soul while following him relentlessly, making it impossible to shake off.

As the scholar rolled in mid-air, barely dodging a treasure’s strike, dust flying everywhere, he suddenly smiled and darted in a certain direction, shouting, “Good Man Brother!”

The elderly-looking Chen Ping’an smiled slightly, whispering, “Mu Mao Brother.”

What followed bewildered all the monsters, who stopped in their tracks, staring at each other in confusion.

The scholar flicked his fingers to produce a golden talisman.

He hurled it toward the ally who seemed to have come to his rescue.

That fellow drew his sword, slashing down at the talisman that burst forth with golden light like the sun rising over the sea.

A massive wave of energy rippled outward in all directions, as if a mountain had crashed into a lake.

As the sword light and talisman dissipated simultaneously, at that moment, the scholar’s aura underwent a complete transformation; his eyes shone brilliantly as he deliberately retracted his spiritual energy, a gesture of surrender. He lunged toward Chen Ping’an, softly saying, “First, cut away this shadow clinging to me, then we can leave together.”

Chen Ping’an nodded, extending his sword, perfectly severing the shadow.

The scholar, who seemed like a different person, sighed with relief and was about to sincerely thank him.

Then a punch came.

His vision went dark.

Damn it.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 573: Since Ancient Times, Sword Immortals Must Drink (Part 1)**

When the scholar finally came to his senses, he was greeted by a splitting headache and the realization that he was perched on the edge of a cliff. Not far from him was a long, iron chain bridge, swaying slightly in the mountain breeze, resembling a giant snake with its head and tail dangling from two branches.

His once-prized robe, the "Hundred-Eyed Glutton" (Bai Jing Tao Tie), was gone, along with the family-crafted talismans that had been neatly tucked into his sleeves. To make matters worse, he found himself bound by a golden demon-binding rope, and upon closer inspection, he realized the quality was quite high; it was made from the long whiskers of two ancient flood dragons. Compared to the so-called whiskers of the copper-green lake's silver carps, this was akin to a summer goddess's moon palace breed encountering the true toad of the Guanghan Palace. Perhaps that was an exaggeration, but it was not far off.

The scholar couldn't help but chuckle in disbelief.

He made no attempt to struggle.

This was because two of his life swords were hovering ominously, one in front of his forehead and the other behind his head.

Fortunately, as long as he hadn’t awakened beneath the soul-retrieving lotus lamp in his ancestral hall, it wasn’t the worst outcome.

With a sigh, he muttered, "Brother Good Man, you borrowed my things; don’t forget to return them later."

Not far away, a young wanderer wearing a straw hat sat cross-legged at the cliff's edge, practicing his sword stance.

The wanderer remained silent.

The scholar continued, “Brother Good Man, it’s not nice to strip people of their clothes. Wasn’t the dragon robe worn by the King of Bones from the Summer Goddess's treasury supposed to turn to ash upon contact? I assure you, that female cultivator's robe from the Qingde Sect was of very mediocre quality, just like that ceremonial wine bowl from the Qingde Sect's ancestral hall; it’s merely a spiritual artifact, not worth much unless you run into some collectors among the cultivators.”

Chen Ping'an still did not respond.

The scholar was not the slightest bit angry; he had lost a robe that couldn’t be seen in public, but he wasn’t exactly naked. He felt some regret over the three golden talismans he had lost. One was the "Azure Sky Mansion Talisman," which could create a true king’s mansion of thunder city, allowing a cultivator inside to withstand several strikes from an infant’s life treasure. As for golden elixirs, it would take half a stick of incense before they could breach the mansion’s door. The second was the "Jade Clarity Light Talisman," which, when thrown by a cultivator, illuminated the underworld and shocked demons and ghosts, affecting a range of several miles and primarily used for breaking formations and extricating oneself.

The last one was the most precious, a secret talisman from his family, the "Cloud Sky Slashing Talisman," which contained four invaluable divine lights within its core. Once unleashed, it would summon the manifestations of four ancient deities: the Thunder God, the Electric Mother, the Wind Lord, and the Rain Master, to strike together in one blow.

Previously, when he was using talismans in the courtyard of the Fallen Mountain's Guanghan Palace, this was the item he had in his sleeve.

Unfortunately, at that time, his opponent had also been slippery, possessing hidden movements in their sleeve. The scholar could not gauge the opponent’s depth, and since the distance was close, the talisman’s might was too great, threatening to slice off half of the Fallen Mountain. He did not wish to kill a thousand and injure himself eight hundred, nor did he want to reveal his trace; thus, he suppressed his killing intent.

As for the talisman that was later broken by this person’s sword, while it was indeed powerful, it did not appear as grandiose as the Cloud Sky Slashing Talisman and was not part of his family’s secret teachings. It belonged to a talisman sect in the North Julu Region, specifically designed to counter sword cultivators. So, it could be said that until that moment, the scholar had not been forced to reveal his ace in the hole by the encroaching demons; he merely appeared to be in a precarious situation.

His true intention was to create a huge commotion visible across the mountains, as he was certain that the person would secretly return, quietly hiding somewhere, and perhaps they would seize the opportunity to assassinate him.

Had the scholar not considered feigning weakness and then swiftly slaying his opponent? 

But alas, fate did not align with his wishes.

It was indeed the case that the higher the path, the stronger the demon.

That person's sword was quite peculiar and extraordinarily strange. A golden talisman meant to bind the Earth’s ancestral palace sword had failed to restrain the opponent's long sword, rendering his prepared escaping technique and the second slashing talisman in his sleeve useless. Otherwise, he could have fled with the talisman, inflicting heavy injuries on the opponent, leaving them to deal with the demons, and ensuring his own survival.

And that fellow, in a moment of confusion, had forcibly seized the majority of his soul's dominance, leaving himself entirely defenseless. And what had been the result? He was ruthlessly struck by the opponent, causing him to end up in such a state.

However, amidst the misfortune, there was a stroke of luck: the other party had not decisively killed him, looted him, or destroyed his body.

Was this not a small blessing earned from the opponent’s mercy?

Otherwise, when he woke up at home, although he had barely preserved his life, he would have to pay the enormous price of losing a soul and a breath, damaging his path. Even if his family had secret methods to compensate, it would at least delay his breakthrough by a hundred years. At that time, how could his family let that person off lightly? Not to mention a pursuit spanning thousands of miles; even if he were a direct descendant of another sect, they would still pursue him across continents, ten years failing could lead to a hundred years.

The Yang family of the Cloud Sky Palace in the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Division had long been recognized throughout the continent for their deep sense of gratitude, immense kindness, long memories of grievances, and merciless vengeance.

The remaining three golden talismans that had gone to waste, and that Hundred-Eyed Glutton robe, no matter how valuable they were, could not compare to the life of a cultivator or the path itself.

Thus, the scholar took it in stride.

His father had always reminded him that on the path of cultivation, one must endure minor losses.

With a smile, the scholar asked, “Brother Good Man, how did you manage to help me escape the encirclement of the demons? It must have taken quite an effort?”

After the sword aura had completed its eighteenth cycle, Chen Ping'an sheathed his sword and replied, “It wasn’t too troublesome. The demons had fought with you for too long and were already exhausted. They feared that besides me, there might be other reinforcements, so they hesitated, and their encirclement became mere show. However, they still entangled me for a while before I found an opportunity to run south all the way to Ghostly Abyss Valley. It’s just that your robe was stripped by them, and I couldn’t stop it. I feel quite guilty.”

The scholar chuckled, “And this demon-binding rope and two flying swords?”

Chen Ping'an replied with a serious expression, “To protect you. There are two major demons lurking just across the iron bridge, a python spirit and a spider spirit. You should have seen them; I was afraid that if I focused on my cultivation, I would miss your life.”

The scholar glanced at the iron bridge and indeed saw two rather pitiful creatures. But were those considered major demons? They hadn’t even formed human shapes; the sight of this innate demon-binding rope alone had likely scared them to the point of fleeing dozens of miles away.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Aren’t you afraid that when you wake up, you won’t listen to a word I say, and as soon as you open your eyes, you’ll want to fight me? Wouldn’t that deepen the misunderstanding?”

The scholar nodded, “Brother Good Man, not only do you possess a chivalrous heart, but you also act with meticulous care. I truly can’t find a single flaw!”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Mu Zhaobrother, now can you tell me your surname? We’re now brothers in life and death; if you keep hiding, it would be inappropriate.”

The scholar grinned brightly and sincerely replied, “My surname is Yang, given name Mu Zhaobrother. I was born in the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Division. Due to my decent aptitude, thanks to my ancestors serving in the Chongxuan Division for generations, I was fortunate enough to be bestowed a surname by the Prime Minister of the Cloud Sky Palace. This time I ventured southward, and before reaching Ghostly Abyss Valley, my divine money was nearly spent. I was thinking of slaying demons and accumulating good deeds while earning some small change, to prepare a decent gift for a certain prince who has a good relationship with the Chongxuan Division for his birthday next year.”

Since this person recognized the words “Dragon Gate” on the stele, it was likely that the three talismans had been seen through.

Therefore, the scholar no longer regarded the other as a fool, lest he get angry and land a punch on him.

Chen Ping'an, half-smiling, asked, “I’ve heard of the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Division; even I, an outsider from another continent, have heard of its great name. Do you know the one born with the Dao Seed, Yang Ningxing?”

The scholar rolled his eyes, saying, “As an inner disciple of the Cloud Sky Palace, how could I not know this famous little deity? Not only do I know him, but I also know his elder brother, Yang Ningzhen, who enjoys traveling far and wide. My relationship with those two is quite decent. Of course, these two are high-ranking direct descendants of the Yang family, while I’m just an acquaintance. We’re not particularly close friends.”

Seeing that he seemed skeptical, the scholar had no way to convince him. After all, the other couldn’t resort to torture. But if it came to that, a demon-binding rope and two flying swords wouldn’t necessarily restrain him.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “Were you playing with a pack of wild dogs earlier just to make me think that I could take advantage of the situation and was bent on killing me?”

The scholar was about to make up some nonsense when suddenly, a sharp pain stabbed through his mind, causing him to sigh deeply. The next moment, he transformed entirely, resembling the “pure yang righteous energy” he had first claimed to Chen Ping'an. It didn’t matter if he was a Qi practitioner or a straightforward martial artist; while his energy could be hidden and his aura could change, that innate atmosphere that one was born with is hard to disguise.

Chen Ping'an frowned and asked, “Do you have a soul separation condition? Are both sides fighting for your soul?”

It was akin to brothers fighting within the walls of a home, endlessly arguing.

This was generally a taboo for cultivators. 

Once this happened, breaking through to the next realm was like a crippled person trying to climb a mountain—extremely difficult. It would be a stroke of luck just to attain the Golden Elixir stage. To hope to break the Infant Heart Demon would be nothing short of a fantasy.

The scholar sat there, eyes clear, smiling, “To save me, you incurred severe injuries and great loss. That last golden talisman you sacrificed, not only was it precious, but it should also have some connection to my family’s talismans. Therefore, that robe, ‘Hundred-Eyed Glutton,’ and the three talismans in my sleeve will serve as my thanks. As for me, my real name isn’t Yang Mu Zhaobrother, but I am indeed from the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Division. I just won’t tell you my real name; you can guess.”

Chen Ping'an looked puzzled, “Even after ‘he’ fell into his own little world, ‘you’ could still remain awake to watch the vast world outside?”

The scholar nodded, but did not elaborate further.

Chen Ping'an said, “But wanting to kill me is your true intention.”

The scholar laughed, “Isn’t that also your true intention?”

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

The scholar said, “Now that you’ve chosen to save me instead of killing me, I think it’s necessary for us to meet once more. The way I envision the conflict of the Dao should be fair and aboveboard. If you agree, we can choose a day after our respective experiences conclude and have a life-and-death battle on that Forging Mountain? By the way, I need to remind you once again, I have a feeling someone is watching you from a distance in Ghostly Abyss Valley. It’s intermittent and won’t last long. I can only vaguely sense it’s from some place in the north, with profound cultivation. You should be careful.”

Chen Ping'an did not respond.

The scholar smiled, “I need to concentrate on refining that Dragon Gate stele, so I must focus without distraction. You and the other ‘me’ will have to endure some trouble. How should I put it? He is equivalent to the evil within my heart; all thoughts, though reduced to a mustard seed, appear incredibly vast and pure. The evil is truly evil, without the need for disguise, acting without restraint. However, every time I am distracted and allow him to take control of this body, we will set three rules that he cannot overstep too much. Oh, and while he acts, I can observe everything in its entirety, which serves as a way to learn Dao and refine my true heart. But when I speak, he can only sleep.”

Chen Ping'an felt a jolt within, about to speak, when the scholar had already closed his eyes.

During this time, Chen Ping'an noticed that as the scholar’s eyelids lowered, he seemed to glance at a spot nearby.

When he opened his eyes again, it was the familiar scholar from the Fallen Mountain, wearing a face that seemed to have just soiled his pants.

The two fell silent, and after a moment, Chen Ping'an spoke, “Yang Ningxing, you’re quite remarkable, one of the top ten talented individuals from North Julu Prefecture, a little deity of the Cloud Sky Palace. Why hide it?”

The scholar looked bewildered.

Chen Ping'an laughed heartily.

The scholar thought that “he” shouldn’t be so open-hearted with others and felt helpless, saying, “If my little deity from the Chongxuan Division heard this, he would be furious. Yang Ningxing is the most rigid; he can’t bear even a hint of jest. I much prefer interacting with his brother, Yang Ningzhen, and that female cultivator responsible for our Chongxuan Division’s dealings with the court. She is truly a charming beauty. My journey this time, venturing into Ghostly Abyss Valley, is to make a name for myself, hoping she will take a liking to me. Brother Good Man, your name is great and your skills even greater. When we return to the Great Source Dynasty, you must meet her. She organized a grand Daoist ceremony at a young age and is incredibly wise. If you meet her, you will likely fall for her, but she might not like you. In that case, we can drown our sorrows together with wine, brothers in hardship, and our friendship will last forever!”

Chen Ping'an stood up, ignoring the scholar’s playful banter. He scanned his surroundings and summoned the demon-binding rope to his hand, then sheathed it back at his waist.

The scholar’s earlier glance before his spirit sank was either an intentional act to sow doubt or perhaps there was indeed something mysterious nearby. Was there a high-ranking expert present, concealed from his sight? If that were the case, was it the wandering spirit of a peak Infant, hidden nearby? Or perhaps an even higher realm’s hermit? Was it the small Xuandu Temple not recorded in the "Rest Assured Collection," or the Great Round Moon Temple? Or was it an apparition from the north of Ghostly Abyss Valley?

In any case, it was unlikely to be Jiang Shangzhen.

If Jiang Shangzhen were quietly observing the mountains and rivers, watching his movements, that would be normal. But to secretly come here and remain unseen was absolutely not Jiang Shangzhen’s style.

Regarding the plans of the Jade Guizong in Book Lake, Jiang Shangzhen had previously been open about some heavenly secrets at the Mural City.

Chen Ping'an believed about seventy to eighty percent of it.

Thus, for now, Jiang Shangzhen could be considered a friend rather than an enemy, not plotting against him.

To put it bluntly, if Jiang Shangzhen truly wanted to kill him, it wouldn’t be any harder than this self-styled swordsman in blue.

Presently, facing an Infant, Chen Ping'an could only flee for his life.

Whereas Jiang Shangzhen was known for enjoying slaying Infants.

Chen Ping'an sighed internally.

He silently reminded himself not to rush.

Cultivation is not like drinking, where one can chug or sip at will. Food must be eaten bite by bite, paths must be walked step by step, and money must be earned piece by piece.

The scholar stood up and stretched, “Brother Good Man, are those two your life swords? Sword cultivators are indeed a profession that consumes gold and silver. It’s already quite a feat to keep a single sword alive relying on sect support. How did you manage it? Is it through this journey of traveling thousands of miles and robbing houses? It seems we’re alike, relying on our lineage’s cultivator background; sect support isn’t enough, so we disguise our adventures as training, repeatedly filling our pockets?”

Chen Ping'an did not answer this question. He gazed northward and said, “Earlier, I suffered a great loss to save you. What now?”

The scholar rubbed his hands together with a grin, “My robe and three talismans have fallen into the enemy’s hands, so naturally, I must seek to reclaim them.”

Chen Ping'an shot him a glance, “That makes sense. Then we’ll continue on our separate paths. You can go reclaim your lost items, and I wish you well in making a name for yourself in Ghostly Abyss Valley. As for me, I’ll quietly pick up any scraps.”

The scholar sighed, “That won’t do. I have a deadly feud with the demons. If I reveal myself, won’t I be attacked by all of them in a frenzy? If I end up in a worse situation, that won’t do. I can’t feel secure without you standing guard for me. Strange enough, when I’m with you, I feel particularly brave. I’d fearlessly walk into the dragon’s den or the tiger’s lair!”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Now that you’ve lost your protective robe and talismans, what significance is there for me to accompany you? Am I just a burden?”

The scholar raised his hand, revealing an item, then quickly covered it with spiritual energy, revealing a small purple flying sword. He smiled, “A hermit has his secret treasures. This sword, named Purple Grace, is modeled after a great sword immortal from our North Julu Region. It’s not a sword cultivator’s life sword, but its aura surpasses that of a flying sword. It’s perfect for pretending to be a great sword immortal to intimidate others! It’s a unique skill of the Hate Sword Mountain, a true rarity, comparable in fame to the protective spirit treasure armor forged at the Sanlang Temple!”

Chen Ping'an pointed to the long sword behind him, “Do I need you to intimidate anyone? Can you show a bit of sincerity?”

The scholar reluctantly put away the intimidating Purple Grace sword and then flipped his palm to reveal a small object with a dragon seal, his expression solemn, “This is the absolute last item in my secret stash. If it’s shattered, a mighty dragon will descend, wreaking havoc. It can only be used once. This was a debt I owed to my sister from the Chongxuan Division for borrowing the Cloud Sky Palace’s heavy treasure.”

Chen Ping'an surveyed this Yang Mu Zhaobrother.

The scholar smiled back.

Chen Ping'an began to doubt, if it came to a life-and-death struggle, how much of a chance did he really have?

Back at the Summer Goddess’s Guanghan Palace, he felt about seventy to eighty percent confident. But now, he would be lucky to say it was fifty-fifty.

The reason was simple: that Purple Grace sword was indeed a replica, not the genuine life weapon of a mountain peak sword immortal, making it perfect for intimidating Infant-level cultivators.

But for killing Golden Elixir cultivators, it was even more fitting.

Combined with that unknown dragon seal stamp, if truly wielded by the scholar, it would pose a threat as both offense and defense. If the opponent also had a better quality robe, and donned a protective armor, what would the so-called Hundred-Eyed Glutton robe be? It was merely a disguise for this scholar.

A true disciple of the Chongxuan Division, potentially born with a Dao Seed, venturing out for experience, how could he not have a family heirloom robe or armor for protection?

The scholar’s gaze was filled with resentment as he said, “Why has Brother Good Man fallen silent? Are you coveting my little fortune? I certainly can’t beat you, so I can only bring out my robe and spirit treasure armor to save my life.”

“Didn’t you say that the dragon seal was your last secret treasure?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Having wealth is indeed impressive; I’m scared of you.”

The scholar sighed, “My sister once said, when you venture out, if your skills are mediocre, you should speak less and guard your heart.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Let’s go.”

The scholar rubbed his hands together, “Shall we go to the Mountain-Moving Great Sage’s peak, or to the Earth-Yielding Mountain to reclaim our lost honor?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Let’s follow that black river and search for the Old Dragon Cave.”

The scholar inquired, “Why?”

Chen Ping'an began to descend along the ridge, slowly explaining, “The protective formation at Earth-Yielding Mountain has already been broken by you, and the demons must be gathered at the Mountain-Moving Ape’s peak. It’s possible that the Earth-Yielding Mountain’s Pi Chen Yuanjun has either hidden his treasures well or has taken them along to his allies. Are we going to drink the northwest wind at Earth-Yielding Mountain? Or are we going to confront the Mountain-Moving Ape head-on? Should we beat them up again?”

The scholar clapped his hands in excitement, exclaiming, “Right! Brother Good Man is indeed clever. Those two turtles remained hidden during the battle at Earth-Yielding Mountain. As you said, they have no sense of martial ethics. So even if we seek trouble with them, the demons at the Mountain-Moving Ape’s side will likely harbor resentment and will not come to their aid.”

Chen Ping'an sneered, “What I’m worried about now is whether the goddess from the Summer Goddess’s Guanghan Palace, whom you’ve killed, will have her backers coming for us. Who exactly is that?”

The scholar chuckled, “It’s an old Infant spirit from Ghostly Abyss Valley, quite renowned among the cities to the north. He dared to defy the orders of the Lord of Jingguan City. In life, he was a great general of the Divine Tactics Kingdom, with remarkable achievements. Although he was never praised for his military prowess, after his death, later generations of strategists praised him for using soldiers correctly rather than through cunning. His historical reputation is quite high. If not for the foolish emperor he served falling for a ruse and forcing him to lead an army, leading to the death of his entire family, that would have been a significant turning point; otherwise, the outcome of the Skeleton Marsh battle might not have been what it was.”

The scholar paused for a moment, feeling a bit melancholy, “As for how the Summer Goddess got close to this spirit, I can’t predict such things.”

The two walked along the mountain path. Chen Ping'an noticed him turning his head towards the cliffside and said, “Don’t set your sights on those two demons.”

The scholar asked in surprise, “Are you familiar with them?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not familiar.”

The scholar grew more puzzled, “Then why protect them? Leaving behind a potential threat… true, at present, my cultivation is meager, and I’m destined not to leave Ghostly Abyss Valley for centuries. I won’t be able to harm anyone.”

Chen Ping'an replied slowly, “All sentient beings struggle in their cultivation.”

The scholar scrutinized Chen Ping'an, “You really are injured, huh?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “That Golden Elixir spirit wanted to pull the same trick on me, using that shadow to bind me. After I broke it with a sword, the Mountain-Moving Ape seized the opportunity and struck me with a hammer. Then, when the treasures came pouring in, I had no choice but to use a talisman worth a fortune. I’m still nursing a heartache over it.”

Chen Ping'an felt gloomy. It wasn’t just the pain of losing the last remaining golden shrinkage talisman; revealing his life-saving methods would make it more difficult to use two golden shrinkage talismans to break through the Ghostly Abyss Valley and the Skeleton Marsh’s small world’s restrictions in the future.

The scholar noticed the slight change in tone when Chen Ping'an spoke of the Mountain-Moving Ape and keenly asked, “What, do you have a grudge against the Mountain-Moving Ape?”

Chen Ping'an replied nonchalantly, “I smashed it with a meteor hammer; isn’t that a grudge?”

The scholar clasped his hands behind his back, swaggering, and chuckled, “Isn’t that going to make Brother Good Man dizzy with blood?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “If you truly feel guilty, I don’t mind you giving that intimidating flying sword or the dragon seal to me as compensation.”

The scholar waved his sleeves dramatically, yelling, “Brother Good Man, I’m begging you, can you stop coveting my little fortune? If you keep this up, I’ll start to feel anxious.”

Chen Ping'an cast a glance northward, saying, “When we reach the black river, let’s stick to the old rule: seventy-thirty?”

The scholar was greatly surprised, feeling a bit embarrassed, “That would be too much.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled.

In an instant, the scholar grasped the implication of his words and then grinned, “Let’s make it fifty-fifty. Harmony brings wealth! If that doesn’t work, how about forty-sixty, with you getting sixty and me forty?”

The two traveled northward, choosing a small path through the mountains, traversing waters and hills. Chen Ping'an flew like a rabbit, while the scholar rode the wind, leisurely keeping pace beside him.

When Chen Ping'an stood atop a tall tree, gazing into the distance, the scholar casually asked, “When I was killing that Summer Goddess in Guanghan Palace, why didn’t you intervene? Isn’t this Moon Palace breed hard to cultivate into a Golden Elixir?”

Chen Ping'an feigned ignorance.

Then, leading the way, the two passed by the Copper-Green Lake, carefully circumventing Copper Official Mountain, like elite scouts moving in silence.

The scholar was quite impressed. 

Was he so well-versed in the mountains and waters?

But why didn’t he seem like a rustic wilderness cultivator?

Upon reaching the Black River, Chen Ping'an had already removed his straw hat and sword, covering himself with an old man’s mask, and even had the scholar change into new attire, then handed him a youthful face mask crafted by Zhu Lian.

Without a hint of hesitation, the scholar accepted it, feeling it was rather amusing.

The Black River stretched over two hundred miles, not particularly large, but it was quite impressive in the water-scarce Ghostly Abyss Valley.

The two turtles from the Great Round Moon Temple had long held dominion over this river.

The river’s current was tumultuous.

Upstream stood a temple dedicated to the goddess, which naturally belonged to the water deity of the Earth-Overturning Lord. However, the temple was just as notorious for its licentiousness, and the little turtles hadn’t managed to sculpt a golden body; they merely made a statue to serve as a facade. But even if they had truly crafted a golden body, they wouldn’t dare place it openly in the temple. Any passing Infant spirit could easily shatter it with a single strike, leading to catastrophic consequences. In fact, the moment the golden body showed its first crack, it would signify the hearts of all mountain and water deities growing cold, indicating the signs of decay in their so-called immortality, which could not be repaired by mere human incense. 

In the Buddhist sect, when golden body Arhats faced such calamities, they would label it as “breaking the law,” fearing it like a tiger.

Just like Daoist immortals who endured great hardships to finally cultivate a pure, glass-like body, only to find that purity tainted, no matter how they scrubbed their hearts, they could not erase it. How could they not fear?

The scholar had a deep understanding of this.

Several cultivators from the Chongxuan Division had perished this way, never achieving true transcendence.

As night fell, the two entered the temple and found it completely empty, without a single obstruction.

With his hands clasped behind his back, the scholar looked around and chuckled, “Well, they’ve truly turned into turtles. What are we to do now?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Don’t you have any water-splitting spells or divine abilities?”

The scholar nodded, “I do have one. A while back, I picked up a shattered water-evading pearl, but it’s far inferior to the water-evading beast my sister raises. If I had that beast, I could easily find any hidden dragon palace in the depths of the great rivers. That tiny creature, with its horns just a finger’s length, could whip up a hundred-foot wave with just a shake of its head. It’s truly enviable.”

Chen Ping'an expressed, “So should I wait for you to call your sister here?”

The scholar laughed heartily, shaking his sleeve. He held up a snow-white, crystal-clear pearl and slapped it into his mouth, which then transformed into a rolling black smoke that swept into the river without a single splash.

Chen Ping'an continued to explore the temple, which resembled the ordinary water deity shrine of the secular dynasty, with no hint of transgression.

Upon reaching the main hall of the temple, he crossed the threshold and looked up to find that the statue of the Earth-Overturning Lord on the altar was not tall, adhering strictly to what a middle-level river deity statue should be.

The statue depicted a woman with a sturdy build, wielding a large axe, and she was indeed not beautiful.

Chen Ping'an exited the main hall and wandered into the back hall, finding nothing unusual, so he returned to sit on the steps of the temple, patiently waiting for the scholar’s return.

What occupied his thoughts were the records concerning the Cloud Sky Palace of the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Division.

Like the Sanlang Temple, both were well-known immortal residences in North Julu Region, but the Cloud Sky Palace also held the title of the Chongxuan Division, making it even more sophisticated.

The Buddhist sect in North Julu was flourishing, while the Great Source Dynasty was the unrivaled power in the central region of the continent, leading to fierce competition between Buddhist and Daoist sects.

However, since the Great Source Dynasty could revere the Dao over the Buddha to the extent of establishing the Chongxuan Division and having the Daoists oversee a national Buddhist temple, it was not only due to the great Emperor Lu’s devotion to the Dao but also because of the strong foundation of the Cloud Sky Palace.

In Longquan County, Wei Bo often welcomed and sent off visitors at the Niu Jiao Mountain immortal crossing and knew that Chen Ping'an planned to travel through Julu Region. Therefore, he prepared many relevant books and records about the immortal forces in Julu Region, with the Cloud Sky Palace being one of the key focuses, especially since Chen Ping'an had mentioned that he would inevitably traverse the great river leading to the sea, which happened to pass through the Great Source Dynasty. Moreover, the Great Source Dynasty placed immense importance on this river, to the extent that they set up inspectors and water officials along its route, with high ranks equivalent to that of the sixth ministry’s deputy and a third-rank military general. Historically, there were indeed countries whose relationships with the Great Source Dynasty had soured, and the entire court vehemently opposed the idea of having officials from another country on their land, viewing it as a great national shame. The Great Source Dynasty had launched military campaigns three times, earning the scorn of the entire continent for their warmongering, even falling out with Confucian academies due to this.

The establishment of the Chongxuan Division’s Cloud Sky Palace was practically a chronicle of the decline of other sects and the Buddhist forces in the Great Source Dynasty.

The demolition of the New Celebration Palace’s Heaven Official Hall for the Chongxuan Division’s Heaven Origin Hall, the use of materials from the Jia Ling Temple’s giant timber to build the Cloud Sky Palace’s Old Lord Hall, the dismantlement of the Yun Hai Temple’s Bao Hua Hall to create the Chongxuan Division’s archway tower, and the repurposing of materials from the Gan Lu Temple for the Cloud Sky Palace family shrine—all of these were matters that had occurred throughout the early years of the Great Source Dynasty. This kind of extravagance continued, and the subsequent emperors of the Lu family still deemed the Chongxuan Division as shabby, commanding several royal princes to personally oversee the construction, expanding the scale of the Chongxuan Division and the Cloud Sky Palace time and again. In the capital, any buildings that obstructed the Chongxuan Division’s feng shui were to be demolished, and Daoist temples were to be established on the ruins, with names drawn from the historical eras of the Great Source Dynasty, all entrusted to the Daoists of the Cloud Sky Palace to manage. Any disputes within the temples could not be interfered with by the imperial court.

The Chongxuan Division’s Cloud Sky Palace had become the head of the Daoist lineage across the continent.

But in truth, the Heavenly Lord Xie Shi, who had been lingering in Baopingzhou for several years, was the true wielder of authority over the entire Daoist lineage.

Chen Ping'an felt curious about the relationship between the two: was it a mutual disdain, simply equaling each other’s power, resulting in an eternal detachment? Or did they see each other as thorns in their sides, wishing to eliminate each other?

Chen Ping'an looked up to see the river’s waters still swirling, the sound of flowing water growing louder.

The scholar still had not returned.

But suddenly, Chen Ping'an stood up, darting towards the riverbank.

The water had turned dangerously turbulent, with waves lapping over the banks.

There was a strong smell of blood.

Moments later, in the distance along the Black River, the scholar leapt out of the water, dragging a robust woman by her neck, pulling her forward. The woman had her hair disheveled, and her iron armor was in tatters.

The scholar walked on the waves as if it were solid ground. Upon seeing Chen Ping'an, he raised his hand and waved, “Brother Good Man, sorry to keep you waiting!”

As the scholar approached the temple, he casually tossed the nearly unconscious woman onto the shore, causing her to roll over, revealing a blood-stained face.

The scholar came to Chen Ping'an's side and grinned, “What a find! The battle beneath the water was fraught with perils. Luckily, I silently chanted a few words asking for Brother Good Man’s protection, which turned my misfortune into fortune. Otherwise, I might have been abducted by this woman to be her concubine!”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the woman who lay on the ground, pretending to be dead.

The scholar waved his sleeve, sending the little turtle diving into a pit.

He exclaimed, “This water deity is really something! Before the underwater cave, she had the audacity to create a place called the ‘Concubine’s Intent Terrace,’ where she displayed countless bones of those who had the luck to become her husbands. Each skeleton had a soul lamp lit beside it, creating a dazzling scene, a love story that stretched for hundreds of years. If I hadn’t threatened to destroy that high terrace outside the cave, this water deity wouldn’t have come out to see me. In fact, even if I had barged in, if she were truly determined to hide, I wouldn’t have been able to locate her.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Did you extinguish those life soul lamps?”

The scholar nodded with a smile, “Of course! That’s no small feat. Compared to killing that Summer Goddess, it’s even better. Brother Good Man, you truly are my lucky star.”

Chen Ping'an squatted beside the large pit. The woman had already sat up, raising her head to scream, “The heavens receive the sun, moon, and stars; the earth receives water and dust. Sentient beings suffer! This is the calamity those men were destined to face!”

The scholar burst into laughter, giving her a thumbs-up, “What a flowery speech! You almost had me convinced.”

Chen Ping'an looked at the woman and asked, “What about your own calamity? Have you calculated that?”

The woman glared fiercely, “My daughter and I have old ties with the Great Round Moon Temple. Do you dare to kill me?!”

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

The scholar communicated through thought, “Don’t rush to act. Let’s use her to lure something bigger. This water deity is still easy to find; however, the Old Dragon Cave is said to have twists and turns, making it tough to track down the old turtle’s whereabouts.”

Chen Ping'an gently nodded, gathering sound into a line, asking, “Has her lair not been ransacked?”

The scholar lamented in thought, “This one is truly ruthless; sensing something amiss, she activated her powers and closed the cave’s entrance before I could seize her. It can be opened, but it consumes a lot of time. It would take at least a couple of hours to force it open. Historically, cultivators dread this about underwater dragon palaces; they are difficult to find and even harder to open, making it easy to create calamities by mishaps. In places with many people, this could easily result in the deaths of thousands. Here, we don’t have those worries, but once we lure out that old turtle, we can explore the underwater treasures. With your divine weapon, Brother Good Man, it will be even faster to open the door.”

Chen Ping'an remained fixated on the woman from the Black River, smiling, “I can’t last long underwater. Unlike you, I lack water-evading treasures, and my spiritual energy drains too quickly. If I unleash my full power to cut through the cave door, and you sneak a strike at me with the Purple Grace sword, then smash it with the seal, and conjure a few Cloud Sky Palace killing talismans, wouldn’t I end up as fish bait? Wouldn’t that make sense, Mu Zhaobrother?”

The scholar replied with righteous indignation, “Brother Good Man, don’t measure others with your own standards!”

Chen Ping'an responded, “Later, you just need to go into the underwater residence to search for treasures. Since I won’t be putting in any effort, we’ll split it seventy-thirty, with you getting seventy and I thirty.”

The scholar muttered, “Can we really split thirty percent?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I’ll keep watch on the surface while you search for treasures without any worries. But I must warn you, if you’ve got treasures on you, I won’t know how many you’ve truly found. How we split it later will depend on your conscience.”

The scholar asked, “How about eighty-twenty?”

Chen Ping'an agreed, “That works.”

Seeing Chen Ping'an so straightforward, the scholar grew suspicious and cautiously asked, “Could it be that you compared that cave’s treasures with the underground vault of Guanghan Palace? If you feel like you got less than you expected, would you turn hostile?”

Chen Ping'an shared a knowing smile, “That was your suggestion.”

The scholar squatted on the ground, sighing.

The woman observed that the two men seemed to be silently communicating, and they didn’t appear ready to kill her immediately. Thus, her arrogance grew, as she shouted angrily, “Why aren’t you releasing me? Spare your lives! Otherwise, when my father arrives, you’ll find no place to bury your bodies! When I rebuild my Concubine’s Intent Terrace, the first thing I’ll do is use you two as a sacrifice!”

Chen Ping'an turned to the overjoyed scholar and said, “You tricked this kind of character into coming out; there’s nothing worth being proud of, right?”

The scholar waved his hand dismissively, “I’m not proud; I just found it amusing. If it were a true mountain and water deity, even if they were of low status, they would never speak such jokes after living for so many years. It’s no wonder the Ghostly Abyss Valley is so desolate; it’s trapped under the pressure of the mere Peima Sect, living in this shell, never seeing the light of day. It seems there’s a reason for that.”

Chen Ping'an and the scholar simultaneously looked toward a certain spot on the river’s surface.

The scholar chuckled, “Looks like our guest has arrived.”

An old scholar-like water creature poked its head above the river’s surface, hesitating for a while before timidly inching closer.

Still too afraid to approach the two men, it stood in the water, tremblingly saying, “The Black River King wants me to convey a message to the two immortal masters: as long as you spare the Earth-Overturning Lord, you can take whatever treasures you desire from her cave, and we’ll consider it a goodwill gesture.”

The woman in the pit lowered her head.

The scholar found it amusing, turning to Chen Ping'an, “What do you think?”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Then you can go back and tell him we accept this condition.”

The scholar added, “But we need to keep this Earth-Overturning Lord here.”

The creature whimpered, “The Black River King insists that I must bring the Lord back!”

Chen Ping'an stated, “Failure to do your job simply might lead to your death at the Black River King’s hands; however, that’s still better than a certain death here, right?”

The water creature shrank its neck and immediately turned to flee into the water.

The scholar asked, “Shall I launch an assault on the underwater cave’s entrance now?”

Chen Ping'an pointed at the woman in the pit, nodding, “I’ll guard the section of the river near the cave. You keep her with you; perhaps halfway through, you can convince her to open the door herself and spare us a lot of trouble.”

Neither side wasted any time. The scholar seized the robust woman by the neck once more, dragging her along as Chen Ping'an followed closely behind him, heading upstream.

In the end, the scholar vanished into the water.

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 574: Since Ancient Times, Sword Immortals Must Drink (Part Two)

Chen Ping'an stood by the riverbank.

A moment later.

Chen Ping'an chuckled coldly to himself. This old tortoise was indeed ruthless, completely disregarding his daughter's life?

Before him, the entire Black River, once murky and foul, transformed into a deep ink color, and then from upstream, the water began to freeze rapidly. 

It seemed the old tortoise had made up its mind to kill the scholar who had already entered the water to search for treasures.

Not only that, but in the distance, a robust man, whose body was entwined with lightning, charged toward him with fierce momentum. 

It was the Thunder God of Jixiao Mountain.

However, apart from this one, it seemed no other monsters were joining the fray. The Mountain-Moving Great Sage might either be hiding further away or holding back.

Chen Ping'an found it somewhat strange. Did this creature from Jixiao Mountain learn that someone had stolen those golden thunder whips and, unable to vent its anger elsewhere, decided to abandon its allies and come to fight alone after receiving a tip-off from the old turtle?

The old tortoise was using its innate magical powers to freeze the Black River for a hundred miles; such an anomaly left Chen Ping'an feeling helpless.

Nevertheless, he still had to intercept that creature from Jixiao Mountain.

The self-proclaimed Thunder God seemed to have truly lost his temper. Around his body, there were only two tokens circling, but now three more appeared, inscribed with thunder laws, most likely forged from the golden thunder whips.

Suspended in mid-air, he roared, "You little thief, did you steal my Thunder Pool?!"

Chen Ping'an was momentarily taken aback and laughed, "If I had such incredible skill, would you still be alive in the Earth-Yielding Mountain?"

The Thunder God had nearly lost all rationality, roaring incessantly, his body bursting with electric light, "You damned little rascal, dare to ruin my foundation? I will make sure to carve you into a thousand pieces, extracting your soul and punishing you with thunder for a hundred years or a thousand!"

He charged toward Chen Ping'an by the edge of the Black River, simultaneously revealing half of his true form in mid-air: a golden eagle head atop a body over ten feet tall.

Three tokens scattered apart.

He swung a fist at Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an didn’t draw his sword, instead meeting the blow with his own fist.

The beast was indeed famed for its physical resilience, and Chen Ping'an slid back several feet from the impact. The golden eagle creature stepped forward, the three tokens generating golden lightning that intertwined and shot toward Chen Ping'an like thick arms, erratic in trajectory and indiscriminately striking everything in their path. Yet, when the lightning struck the creature, it didn’t slow its advance; instead, the lightning spread across its body and finally coalesced onto its arm, making its first punch glow with golden light, the entire limb appearing as if it were coiled with dozens of tiny golden snakes.

Chen Ping'an intended to engage in close combat without drawing his sword, not even using the initial and full moon energies stored in his sword pouch.

The two exchanged blows, each punch landing with a solid thud.

The creature was growing increasingly excited, grinning fiercely as it fought. With each punch, it summoned the might of thunder and its body shone with brilliant golden light. 

Previously, during its hasty escape from the Earth-Yielding Mountain, a single strike from the Mountain-Moving Ape had sent this beast reeling, blood spitting from its mouth, looking pale and stumbling. Could such a frail body dare to match my enduring strength?

That little marten had spoken the truth; this guy was indeed a sword cultivator, but burdened by a long sword, perhaps its quality was too high to handle fully. Every time he wielded it, he consumed a large amount of spiritual energy, and he certainly couldn’t replenish it entirely in a short time.

No wonder it had only dared to trouble the likes of the Moon Palace and this little tortoise!

However, if it were the other scholar, with his ever-changing magical arts, it wouldn’t dare be so arrogant, fighting at close quarters.

The robust man struck with both fists, roaring, "Return my Thunder Pool!"

Chen Ping'an braced his palms against those two fists, and this time he remained firmly in place.

Under the flashing lightning and the gusts of wind, the golden eagle-headed creature saw a familiar yet strange face, along with eyes that should be familiar but felt alien.

Suddenly, it felt a tightness in its heart and quickly retreated.

Chen Ping'an stomped heavily on the ground, instantly appearing in front of the creature, and lightly threw out a punch.

The creature quickly calculated its strength and unleashed a powerful punch, clearly intending to trade injuries!

The opponent's punch indeed felt insignificant—probably comparable to that of a martial artist at the Fifth Realm outside the Ghost Valley—but his punch landed solidly on the creature’s face.

Yet why did the creature’s head not budge at all?

That wasn’t right!

The second punch was already on its way.

Too fast.

The creature gritted its teeth and continued exchanging blows.

After several punches, the Thunder God was horrified to discover that even wanting to trade injuries with him had become a wishful thought. 

Whether from the previous punches or the thunder strikes of the three innate tokens, the man seemed utterly unfazed—was he some kind of madman who didn’t feel pain at all?

After a dozen punches, the creature's head was smashed to pieces.

The headless body, standing over ten feet tall, fell backward.

Whether it was a final desperate struggle or not, three tokens burst with dazzling golden light, causing Chen Ping'an’s surroundings to be filled with lightning, resembling a manifestation of the small Thunder Pool from Jixiao Mountain.

Chen Ping'an was ensnared within numerous lightning ropes, unable to escape for a moment, and the azure robe he wore developed cracks.

However, Chen Ping'an’s gaze remained on that corpse.

Sure enough, the headless corpse pressed tightly against the ground swiftly retreated and then stood up near one of the tokens, twisting its neck several times before sprouting a new golden eagle head.

With one hand, it formed seals while the other gripped the token tightly, saying solemnly, "Good fellow, it turns out you were pretending to be useless all along in Earth-Yielding Mountain! Truly deserving of being the most despicable sword cultivator on the mountain, your physical prowess is no less than that of a martial artist."

The clouds around Jixiao Mountain billowed, then instantly fell silent.

In the next moment, a lightning bolt as thick as a wellhead struck down toward Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an threw out a punch.

The lightning shattered, but the fragments of lightning surged chaotically into the Thunder Pool, thickening the thunder sludge.

The creature approached the second token and gripped it again, sneering, "A mere sword cultivator, what’s the point of learning boxing? Just keep throwing punches. I want to see how long your skin can hold up in my Thunder Pool!"

Another thick bolt of lightning descended from above.

Trapped in place, Chen Ping'an still threw a punch upward.

The shattered lightning continued to pour into the Thunder Pool.

The creature simultaneously reached the third token.

Controlling the third bolt of heavenly thunder from Jixiao Mountain as it fell from the sky, it also produced a lightning spear in its hand.

As the man threw a punch to ward off the heavenly thunder crashing down, the creature hurled the lightning spear.

This caused a tremor in the creature’s heart.

Chen Ping'an reached out a palm and managed to stop the spear's tip.

The spear surged forward, bright with golden light, fragmenting inch by inch, while Chen Ping'an’s palm merely hovered in place.

In the end, Chen Ping'an clenched his fist, grasping the last remnant of the lightning spear in his palm, tossing it casually into the Thunder Pool, smiling, "Come again."

The golden eagle creature suddenly shouted, "Old tortoise! Don’t worry about that kid underwater for now, come help me kill this foe! Let’s take down one enemy at a time!"

At the source of the Black River, where the water was frozen, an old man in black robes hovered above the river, imitating a monk with one palm upright in front of him, and the other two fingers bent, gently tapping. 

With each tap, a series of temple wooden fish sounds echoed, rippling the air as circles expanded outwards.

With each tap, strings of ink-colored Buddhist scriptures wafted into the ice covering the Black River.

Just as the creature from Jixiao Mountain spoke, it coincided with the old man in black finishing reciting a Buddhist sutra.

He hesitated slightly, perhaps feeling that what the Thunder God said was not without merit. His shoulders shook, revealing his true form as a tortoise as large as a hill.

The old tortoise charged toward Chen Ping'an, shaking the ground with each step.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Brother Mu Mao, if you keep watching from across the river, you’re going to ruin our brotherhood."

A hearty laugh resounded through the air.

The scholar burst forth from the ice-covered river, soaring into the sky, shaking off countless ice shards that fell like snow.

He tossed the bronze seal with the dragon's head toward the old tortoise. The small talisman flashed across the air and, with a crisp sound, stuck to the old tortoise's massive shell, a stark contrast in size.

Yet for some reason, the old tortoise let out a wail, as if suddenly burdened by an enormous mountain. 

Unable to withstand the weight, it collapsed, belly pressed against the river surface, shattering the ice beneath it.

The scholar clapped his hands, "I’ve made my first contribution. It’s your turn, good man."

Chen Ping'an drew his sword, the sound of metal ringing as it exited its sheath. He didn’t care about the intertwining lightning; like an immortal wielding a sword, he slashed downwards, cleaving the golden eagle creature in half from head to toe.

A golden core, the size of a fist and containing all its souls, shot out from the bloodied remains, quickly fleeing.

The three thunder law tokens also vanished in an instant, transforming into three specks of golden light that merged with the golden core.

The flying sword, First Moon, swiftly pursued, delivering a piercing strike.

Ding!

The soul within the golden core wailed, its cries echoing across the ice of the Black River.

However, the golden core didn’t shatter immediately; its escape speed slightly hindered, the flying sword collided with the core, bouncing back, quickly rotating to point its tip once more at the golden core, vanishing in a flash, leaving a dazzling white line in the air.

The core had no choice but to alter its trajectory, narrowly evading that white line.

After two collisions, just as it distanced itself from the white sword light, it finally managed to carve out a sliver of hope, catching sight of the dawn of survival.

A streak of green sword light fell straight from above.

It pierced through the golden core.

The scholar clapped his hands and laughed, "Two swords working together, seamless as can be—truly marvelous."

The golden core was on the verge of shattering, and before the scholar finished speaking, he tossed out a piece of silk-like paper, wrapping the golden core within it. With another swift motion, he grasped the page along with the core in his hand.

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, putting his sword back into its sheath, seemingly still somewhat reluctant.

The First Moon and the Full Moon flew back into the sword pouch in Chen Ping'an's possession.

As Chen Ping'an secured the sword pouch, he lightly tapped his toes and headed toward the motionless old tortoise.

The scholar landed by the riverbank.

Chen Ping'an paused.

Suddenly, the scholar sighed, "Well, we defeated the young one, and now the old one comes. We defeat the old one, and an even older one appears. What now, good man? This is truly troublesome."

An emaciated old monk appeared beside the old tortoise.

Compared to the hill-sized old tortoise, the monk was almost negligible.

But in Chen Ping'an's eyes, the monk's imposing presence dwarfed the tortoise to the size of a mustard seed.

The old monk clasped his hands together, chanted a sutra, and then asked, "Can you gentlemen allow this monk to take this tortoise back to the Great Full Moon Temple?"

The scholar smiled, "I have no objections, but it depends on my brother here; only if he agrees does it count."

The old tortoise pleaded, "Monk, save me! I know my wrongs, and I will devote myself to studying Buddhism in the temple, for a thousand or ten thousand years, I will never leave!"

The old monk looked at Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an merely met the monk's gaze and asked, "Whether you know your wrongs or not, I don’t care. I only want to ensure that the old tortoise can atone for its sins over the years."

The tortoise attempted to speak but found itself unable to utter a word.

The old monk continued to keep his palms together, nodding, "This poor monk can guarantee that after the old tortoise's cultivation and atonement, it will do good deeds and reap good fruits. It would benefit this world far more than simply killing it."

Chen Ping'an said nothing further.

The old monk smiled, nodded, and then turned to the opposite bank, chanting a sutra, silently murmuring a phrase about turning back is the shore.

As this short-statured old monk clad in oversized robes turned, both he and the old tortoise vanished without a trace.

The scholar casually retracted the now groundless falling bronze seal.

Chen Ping'an remained where he was, lost in thought.

The scholar laughed, "Good man, you’re quite bold. Do you know the roots of this venerable monk?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I don’t know. There’s no record of it in the 'Trustworthy Collection.' I only found out about the Great Full Moon Temple when passing through that peach grove."

The scholar rubbed his cheeks, sighing, "If the secret records of the Chongxuan Office are not mistaken, this old monk is the second living Buddha of our North Julu Continent, and the first immovable as a mountain. If the old monk stands still, neither dodging nor evading, even your Nascent Soul sword cultivator’s innate sword would still be broken after piercing him for a mere incense stick. If it were me, I wouldn't dare to bargain like this with the old monk; the moment he appears, I would have prepared to hand over the old tortoise without a second thought. But good man, your gambling luck is truly remarkable; the old monk actually smiled instead of getting angry. At least we brothers did not end up as enemies with the Great Full Moon Temple."

Chen Ping'an slowly replied, "To bear witness to such results, one must have such intentions."

The scholar groaned, "Oh dear, good man, don’t say that. I’m a Daoist, and I can’t stand such talk."

Chen Ping'an suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, walked onto the melting ice without the old tortoise's magical support, sat cross-legged, and grabbed a handful of ice, casually applying it to his face.

Blood continued to pour from his seven orifices.

Chen Ping'an stared blankly, a hint of a smile on his face.

The scholar crouched not far away, wide-eyed, and softly asked, "Good man, in a situation where your soul is agitated and your bones tremble, don’t you feel any pain at all?"

Chen Ping'an tugged at the corners of his mouth, gazing into the distance. "Do you believe me if I say it’s just an itch?"

The scholar nodded vigorously, "I believe!"

Internally, he cursed, "I believe your ghost."

The scholar began silently counting, wanting to see when this guy’s blood would finally stop flowing.

Chen Ping'an turned to ask, "What about the Over-Sea Yuanjun?"

The scholar smiled, "She’s tied to a demon-binding rope, ready to be summoned at will."

Chen Ping'an’s gaze turned peculiar.

The scholar smiled widely, "Am I not allowed to have a demon-binding rope while you have your demon-binding thread?"

The scholar extended a hand, revealing a snow-white rope that, with a gentle shake, pulled the towering woman from beneath the frozen river. It appeared as though she was being yanked by her hair, tumbling out of the water and landing at the scholar’s feet in just a few blinks.

Chen Ping'an's eyelids twitched.

How many "hidden treasures" did this guy have?

The scholar asked, "What shall we do with her? Just give your orders, and I will follow!"

Chen Ping'an replied, "As long as she is willing to open the cave herself, she can live."

The scholar nodded and smiled at the little tortoise, "Did you hear that?"

But the woman made a strange move, glancing at Chen Ping'an before turning back to the scholar, "I want you to swear an oath before I open the door."

The scholar burst out laughing, extending his finger and suppressing his amusement, clearing his throat, and said seriously, "Alright, alright, I, Yang Mu Mao, swear to the heavens..."

The woman suddenly broke into loud tears, "I know I’m doomed! You’re all liars! Great liars!"

Chen Ping'an narrowed his eyes.

The scholar's expression shifted slightly, then he laughed, "Never mind, let her go. Keeping her alive could be useful to me. The Great Source Dynasty just happens to lack a River Goddess. If I successfully recommend her, it would be an achievement more valuable than killing her for virtue."

Chen Ping'an extended his hand.

The scholar wore a frown, pulling out the page wrapped around the soon-to-shatter golden core, "This page is incredibly valuable; I really can’t give it to you, good man. But if the page is opened, the golden core of that Thunder God will shatter violently—its power could equal that of a Nascent Soul strike. This isn’t a small matter; being this close, we could both suffer."

Chen Ping'an said, "The cave’s gains will change from three-seven to five-five split; one share is for me shielding you from disaster, and one share is for this shattered golden core."

The scholar hesitated.

Chen Ping'an said, "Forty-sixty split. I take sixty, you take forty; even if this golden core shatters, it’s still a golden core..."

The scholar put away the page and golden core, decisively stating, "Fifty-fifty!"

Chen Ping'an said, "I’m too heavily injured to move. You go fetch the treasure."

The scholar said "Oh" with a smile, "Huh? Good man, why aren’t you fainting from blood loss?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "It’s my own blood, I’m not fainting."

The scholar suddenly realized.

Then the scholar ordered the woman to kneel and stood before her, one hand behind his back, his two fingers aligned as he drew a symbol on her forehead, slicing through the skin deep enough to see bone.

The woman, knowing the severity of the situation, gritted her teeth and remained silent.

After the scholar withdrew his hand, he kicked her head, "Lead the way."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "The sooner you go and return, the better. If you don’t come back, that’s fine too."

The scholar laughed heartily. The woman activated her powers, melting the ice and diving into the depths toward her lair.

Once far from Chen Ping'an,

She cautiously asked, "Why didn’t the immortal master take advantage of that man's weakness to kill him? It would save us a lot of trouble!"

The scholar, fingers like hooks, grabbed her head angrily, "Do I need you to teach me how to do things?!"

The woman felt like her head might explode, howling in despair, pleading for mercy.

The scholar let her go, muttering, "Damn it, if I could kill that guy without paying half my life, I would do it in a heartbeat... But if it costs more than half my life, then that’s a different story. Besides... what if I die?"

Feeling somewhat restless, the scholar slapped the woman, sending the Over-Sea Yuanjun tumbling head over heels, and then kicked her hard into the distance.

The woman, rolling in the water, finally stopped, not daring to rise, feeling like she was in the depths of despair.

The scholar finally relented, saying, "Why aren’t you hurrying along?!"

He slapped his forehead, revealing a water-repellent pearl that he had not previously included in his preparations.

He had let his guard down.

But it didn’t matter much.

After all, that guy never intended to follow him into the water. There was no point in hiding his innate water-related magic anymore.

The ice of the river began to melt faster and faster.

Chen Ping'an rose and returned to the riverbank.

Looking around, in the harsh winter, the world was desolate.

Chen Ping'an slowly regulated his breath, recovering his energy.

About half an hour later, the scholar returned alone, and Chen Ping'an didn’t ask about the Over-Sea Yuanjun’s whereabouts. 

"The clear-minded do not speak in dark tongues. That wretched girl still needs to tidy up her belongings—some items are hard to move and not very valuable—and I’ll have her go over there to extort her underlings. Having spent so much time with you, I should learn your way of making money, good man."

The scholar chuckled, "Let’s go; we’ll split the spoils at the shrine. The atmosphere here doesn’t show it."

Chen Ping'an had no objections.

The two entered the shrine and sat across from each other on the steps outside the main hall. The scholar waved his sleeve, and various items clattered to the ground, forming a mountain of treasures.

The scholar boasted, "Knowing you’re a hero who plunders as the wild goose passes, I brought back everything I could find, regardless of value. Among them is one magical artifact, twelve spirit tools. As for the divine coins, I’m not lying; they’re all in the old tortoise’s cave. This tortoise, who should rightfully become the Water Goddess, is so poor it’s outrageous—the total is only eighteen thousand snowflake coins. Good man, I truly put in the effort; you don’t know, I nearly smashed those large screens just to get them over here. That girl almost had her eyes pop out."

Pointing at a shining jade hairpin, he said, "This is the only magical artifact. When a cultivator wears it in their hair, it can ward off water and keep warmth, but it’s a bit flashy and not of high quality among magical artifacts. However, for those practicing water magic, it’s not bad. The other spirit tools are all of similar worth, so it works out to splitting them evenly. You choose first, good man. As for this hairpin and that pile of snowflake coins I haven’t revealed yet, you can pick one first."

Chen Ping'an first rolled up those items that the scholar deemed worthless and tucked them into his pouch.

Then leaning forward, he carefully examined the twelve spirit tools, ultimately selecting six to keep.

Chen Ping'an said, "The hairpin is yours; I want the snowflake coins."

The scholar seemed somewhat puzzled but still lifted his sleeve, causing the snowflake coins to rain down onto the ground.

Chen Ping'an waved his sleeve like a dragon drinking, gathering them all back into his pouch.

After the scholar put away the jade hairpin, he braced his hands on his knees, "What do we say next?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Brother Mu Mao, I treated you sincerely, yet you tested me with a tampered hairpin. What should we say about that?"

The scholar feigned innocence, "What crime can’t be justified? Good man, isn’t this a bit harsh? We’re both esteemed gentlemen; let’s not become like those wild cultivators who fall out over distributions."

Chen Ping'an said, "You place the hairpin on the ground, and I will strike it with my sword. We’ll see then."

The scholar asked, "If good man, you wrongfully accuse me and break my hairpin, wouldn’t I be both heartbroken and financially damaged? What then?"

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, "If I’ve wronged you, I’ll hand over six spirit tools as compensation."

The scholar’s expression fluctuated.

Chen Ping'an lightly tapped his sword pouch.

The scholar’s gaze remained fixed on Chen Ping'an, and he gently placed the hairpin on the ground between them.

Chen Ping'an halted his tapping.

From the sword pouch, the flying sword First Moon shot out.

The scholar suddenly said, "Wait."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "What’s it to be? Keep the jade hairpin or hand over your six spirit tools?"

The scholar laughed heartily, obviously pleased, his fingers tightening around the bronze seal, he brought it down heavily onto the jade hairpin, which promptly broke into two pieces.

A rich spiritual energy burst forth, and the hairpin’s luster slowly dimmed.

It no longer held any mystique.

The wind blew, causing their hair and sleeves to flutter violently.

Chen Ping'an frowned.

The scholar smiled, "Good man, winning against you once is not easy."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Do you have so much money that it’s weighing you down?"

The scholar shook his head with a laugh, "It’s just that I’ve been holding back my feelings for too long. Before leaving, I had to win this round or risk damaging my Dao heart."

Chen Ping'an clicked his tongue, "You cultivators of the roster don’t treat money as money, let alone magical artifacts."

The scholar sighed, "I have to go now. If not for this small bet for entertainment, I would have turned around and fled without a backward glance."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "No need to see me off."

The scholar stood up, softly saying, "Good man, I hope we meet again by fate."

Chen Ping'an’s expression was complex as he stood, wanting to say something but ultimately finding no words.

The scholar seemed to guess Chen Ping'an’s thoughts, laughed heartily, "Truly a good man!"

After their exchange, the scholar transformed into a wisp of black smoke and vanished into the earth.

The scholar truly left just like that.

Chen Ping'an remained in the shrine, practicing the sword furnace stance.

From the dark night until dawn broke.

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes.

On the ground lay the broken jade hairpin.

He never moved to touch it.

Chen Ping'an stood up, leaped onto the wall, and soared away.

Leaving the two pieces of the now lifeless, yet still artifact-quality hairpin behind.

He headed toward Qinglu Town.

Not to the already headless Old Dragon Cave to scavenge for treasures.

Naturally, he didn’t trust the scholar.

And that Over-Sea Yuanjun had already become his servant; when the scholar had come to the shrine alone, where would she be? What would she do? It was evident.

Even if that wasn’t the case.

Chen Ping'an would still act based on the worst-case scenario.

Yet he suddenly changed his route, opting for a different direction.

Long after, the scholar unexpectedly returned, standing on the steps and looking down at the two pieces of the hairpin, shaking his head, "Such a pity, I didn’t take it away; otherwise, I could have blown your pouch apart."

He carefully tucked the two pieces of the jade hairpin into his sleeve, rather than into his pouch, before truly departing.

This time, the scholar did not vanish into the earth but rather swaggered above the Black River, riding the wind, parting the surging waters, which remained open for a long while.

The scholar’s sleeves billowed, making a fluttering sound as he murmured, "A person should not be too idle, lest thoughts steal away and weeds grow rampant. To be too busy, however, is to lose one’s true self, scattering like birds and beasts. Thus, it is said that to have a carefree mind and body, and to enjoy the pleasures of wind and moon, is a difficult balance."

He glided south along the Black River, occasionally glancing toward the direction of Treasure Mirror Mountain but not approaching it.

This was the only request from his family for this trip.

Do not approach Treasure Mirror Mountain.

The scholar flicked his wrist, revealing the demon-binding rope, which was tied to the Over-Sea Yuanjun. The robust woman was dragged from the water’s surface.

The scholar twisted his wrist again and forcefully smashed her back into the Black River.

This stirred up waves towering over ten feet high.

The scholar landed at the southern end of the Black River, stowed away the demon-binding rope, and the woman wobbled to stand beside him.

The scholar began walking south, and she trembled in fear, following behind.

The scholar kept his pace, turned to smile at her, "You have a father who is heartless, but fortunately, you have followed me, the most chivalrous of masters. So, did you bring the treasures?"

The woman hurriedly retrieved a black-gold porcelain small water vessel from her sleeve, trembling as she said, "I went to Old Dragon Cave as ordered and brought back these two rare fish that my father has carefully raised for eight hundred years. I also sent a message to my father’s trusted aide that as soon as that man enters the Old Dragon Cave and triggers the mechanisms, immediately drop those four Locking Dragon Walls to trap him. Even if he manages to escape, the gathered monsters will be waiting, and that guy will likely suffer greatly."

The scholar took the small water vessel, gently shook it, lowered his head to examine it, and smiled, "This is the unexpected fortune I wanted most on this trip."

The scholar turned to look toward Old Dragon Cave, "As for that place, it’s mostly a wasted effort. I won’t be going there. Right, good man?"

The woman couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Are the cultivators outside Ghost Valley truly this cunning?

The scholar glanced at her, and after putting the water vessel into his sleeve, said, "Don’t worry, not everyone is like us. But you’re a bit foolish; you can’t just grow older without growing wiser. As a River Goddess, whether you become a genuine Water Goddess depends on you. I do not raise useless ones. By the way, apart from these two rare fish, did you manage to take anything else?"

The woman nodded rapidly, quickly taking out a palm-sized jade box, "There’s something else. My father said this was a mother ancestral coin crafted by a great hidden immortal for the last emperor of a former dynasty."

Her face fell as she said, "I was worried my master would grow impatient, so I hurried back. In my father’s secret chamber, there were only these two treasures. After getting the water vessel and the rare fish, I quickly returned without daring to take anything else."

The scholar received the jade box, opened it, and exclaimed, "This is indeed a remarkable treasure—any merchant cultivator would dream of having such a perfect innate item."

The scholar smiled, "Very good. From this moment on, you’re officially the River Goddess of the Great Source Dynasty. You only lack an imperial decree to formalize your position. No worries; I have many decrees with royal seals stored at home, accumulated over the years."

She couldn’t believe it; after a great disaster, she suddenly heard such good news, as if it were a different world.

The scholar had already turned and resumed his journey, laughing, "If I wish, making you a River Goddess would be no trouble at all."

Her steps became lighter, filled with gratitude for that figure in the distance.

The scholar wore a smile, leisurely enjoying the scenery.

Transforming her from a River Mistress to a River Goddess wasn’t due to that mother ancestral coin.

Not because it held little value.

But because a servant’s possessions rightfully belong to the master.

Handing them over and seeking a few verbal praises was already a significant reward. If she dared not offer them voluntarily, then half a beating would suffice; both thunder and rain are the blessings of heaven.

Ultimately, he was still considering the face of that Great Full Moon Temple, pushing things along naturally. The old tortoise might very well become a river creature under the watchful eyes of their Yang family...

With this good relationship as a foundation, many of his plans could proceed smoothly and naturally.

But upon reaching this thought, his expression darkened.

Plans?

For whom was he plotting?

For himself?

Recalling that fellow's final glance back at the shrine only deepened his displeasure.

That gaze wasn’t malicious nor even pitying.

It was indescribable.

Leaving him both puzzled and furious!

Because he actually began to feel pity for himself!

He suddenly remembered the iron cable bridge between two cliffs and the two ant-like monsters.

Eliminate them!

Consider it a farewell gift for that good man!

But just then, he stopped in his tracks, his face twisting.

Then, his expression slowly relaxed.

"That’s enough; we’ll set three rules. This is no child’s play."

It turned out the real Yang Ningxing had returned, smiling, "After traveling thousands of miles, I’ve gained much. With great success, what is there to be dissatisfied with?"

The Over-Sea Yuanjun sensed the change in this person ahead and halted, her heart filled with panic.

She watched as he turned around, his expression gentle. In her eyes, his entire demeanor was completely different from before. He smiled, "Do not be afraid. Let me introduce myself. My name is Yang Ningxing, from the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Office, Yuntian Palace."

The woman instinctively prepared to kneel and bow her head.

The scholar raised his hand to gesture, preventing her from kneeling.

He spoke softly, "On this path of cultivation, we are already friends. In the future, you should neither be arrogant nor belittle yourself."

The woman wept uncontrollably, sobbing, "I will remember! I will never forget my master’s teachings!"

The scholar chuckled in disbelief, shaking his head, and said no more.

Leading her onward.

The scholar glanced toward Treasure Mirror Mountain, uncertain of what was happening there.

Then he bowed his head, "Thank you, senior, for your protection earlier."

A ripple of laughter stirred in the scholar’s heart, and he replied gently, "On this path of cultivation, we are friends. This is what you, Yang Ningxing, said yourself."

Moments later, that voice gradually faded in her heart.

Yang Ningxing continued forward.

As for the woman behind, she had grown accustomed to it.

Over at Treasure Mirror Mountain.

Yang Chongxuan was a bloody mess, hardly a piece of good flesh left on him. Breathing heavily, he sat cross-legged by the deep ravine, his fists resting on his knees, his gaze still steady.

On the opposite bank, that woman named Li Liu had only ruined the lion seal at her waist and a magical knife.

As for the other magical artifacts he had smashed, they were far inferior to these two, not worth mentioning.

Jiang Qujiang had long been taken to the dilapidated temple at the foot of the mountain by the Rain God Maiden.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 575: Since Ancient Times, Sword Immortals Have Needed Wine (Part 3)

The old fox of Xishan and the fox spirit girl, Wei Taizhen, found themselves trapped within a golden circle drawn by Li Liu, completely cut off from the sights and sounds outside. This area was the most intact section near the Deep Ravine.

Yang Chongxuan had considered breaking the barrier with a single punch, but each time, he was successfully thwarted by her. Each encounter left him more battered than the last, turning the situation into a trap that seemed to wait for him to leap into it willingly. 

After several attempts, all of which ended in failure, he found himself increasingly desperate. Although his opponents had suffered significant losses, having lost several magical artifacts, they remained calm and composed, with plenty of energy left to spare. In contrast, Yang Chongxuan was running on fumes.

He shouted, “You vile woman! Do you truly know my Yang family's ancestral master? Was this fortune at Treasure Mirror Mountain planned by you? What are you scheming, that you would take such a long time to plan this?”

Li Liu replied coolly, “Speak respectfully, or you might truly find yourself dead.”

Caught off guard, Yang Chongxuan hesitated, unable to utter any harsh words. The girl, who looked as fragile as a leaf in the wind, was surprisingly fierce, her punches and kicks powerful, and her endless magical techniques even more formidable.

Li Liu asked, “I’ll ask you one last time: do you admit defeat?”

Yang Chongxuan raised both hands. “I concede.”

Only then did Li Liu approach the golden circle, her palm slicing lightly through the air, causing the golden light to vanish instantly. 

Yang Chongxuan nearly lost his temper again.

Inside, the girl and the old fox trembled together, their teeth chattering. 

Li Liu knocked out the old Xishan fox with a single slap. She then raised her hand, pulling the fox spirit girl into the air to match her height. 

A burly young man rushed from a distance, but Li Liu didn’t even glance at him, easily sending him flying with a flick of her sleeve.

With two fingers extended, she struck like lightning, directly gouging out Wei Taizhen’s golden eye. The girl struggled violently, flailing her limbs in a desperate, silent scream.

Li Liu then pointed her toes and ascended to the mountain peak. Moments later, the entire Treasure Mirror Mountain began to tremble.

Li Liu returned to the water’s edge, holding an ancient bronze mirror, which she casually threw across to a man on the opposite shore. As he caught it, she said, “Yang Ningzhen, your family owes me another favor. As for when the two owed favors will be repaid to Chongxuan’s Office and the Cloud Palace, you’ll know when the time comes.”

Yang Chongxuan grinned, “I just want to know how many lives we’ll need to pay this back!”

Li Liu pondered for a moment and shook her head. “You can repay it without any deaths.”

She added, “Provided you don’t seek your own demise.”

Yang Chongxuan nodded. “Understood!”

He took the ancient mirror, then asked, “Aside from this favor, if we reach the level of Ninth Realm Martial Artists and Nascent Soul Earth Immortals, can I challenge you again?”

Li Liu replied expressionlessly, “As long as you have the courage then, I will gladly accept.”

Yang Chongxuan—now Yang Ningzhen—felt his wounds start to heal. He was not merely a pure martial artist of the Golden Body Realm; he had a slim chance to strive for the title of the strongest within that realm.

He strode away from Treasure Mirror Mountain without looking back.

Li Liu watched the fox spirit girl, who was still suspended in the air, crimson tears flowing from one of her eyes, resembling a small spring.

Suddenly, Li Liu asked, “Do you wish to die quickly?”

The girl shook her head with all her might, her lips moving as if trying to say she wanted to live, not die. Or perhaps she wanted to see that man one last time before her end.

Even she didn’t understand why, after just one glance at him, she felt so reluctant to part. Truly, there are instances in this world of love at first sight. 

It was beautiful, despite the calamity it brought her, she felt no grievance.

Li Liu suddenly burst into laughter, as if recalling a delightful memory. At that moment, her expression softened, her once cold eyes squinting into crescents as she gently said, “My younger brother is about to leave the academy for adventures. He’s in need of a maid to serve tea and water. You will be just right.”

She reached out and lightly brushed her fingers across the fox spirit’s eye socket.

Wei Taizhen felt a bone-chilling cold run through her, her spirit trembling, but just a moment later, the pain faded completely.

Li Liu whispered, “I forgot to mention, I accidentally crushed your original eye, so I had to replace it with another. I hope my brother doesn’t mind your mismatched eyes.”

Wei Taizhen suddenly dropped to the ground, fortunately from a low height. She steadied herself after a brief wobble, blinking rapidly to confirm that her pain was indeed gone.

Wei Gaowu rushed over again but, upon nearing the young woman, he suddenly knelt down, pressing his forehead to the ground, choking back tears. “Please, immortal lady, teach me your methods! Wei Gaowu is willing to serve you like an ox or horse. In the future, on the path of cultivation, no matter my level, I will not regret even if I die!”

Li Liu chuckled, “You’re not worthy of being my ox or horse.”

Wei Gaowu wept, banging his head on the ground, begging her to impart her teachings.

As the fox spirit girl was about to speak, Li Liu seized her delicate face, causing five blood holes to appear on her visage. “Now that you’re alive, you should cherish your blessings.”

Li Liu hurled the fox spirit girl, who crashed against the distant stone wall and collapsed to the ground, her hands covering her face as blood seeped through her fingers, yet she dared not make a sound.

Li Liu turned to Wei Gaowu and asked, “Do you want to cultivate?”

Wei Gaowu didn’t lift his head, instead hitting the ground harder, his bloodied forehead pressed against the earth as he shouted, “I do!”

Li Liu said, “It’s simple. Kill that old fox, and I will teach you a legitimate method to ascend to the Fifth Realm. You should know that I am not in the mood to joke with you.”

Wei Gaowu stiffened, falling into silence.

Li Liu chuckled, “It’s too late to regret now. If you don’t kill him, you’ll die instead. The choice between a worthless, aging life and a path to greatness is yours to make, right here and now.”

Suddenly, Wei Gaowu stood up, tears streaming down his face. He glanced back at the still unconscious old fox and then at the desperately shaking fox spirit girl, finally laughing through his tears, “If I die, what of my father? What of Taizhen? Can they live?”

Li Liu nodded.

Wei Gaowu laughed bitterly, then spat, “Damn heavens!”

He turned to glance at the cliff wall, wanting to say something, to warn her that the man was no good, that she shouldn’t like him—definitely shouldn’t like him. 

But in the end, he couldn’t bring himself to speak.

Wei Gaowu looked towards the woman, who stood taller than Yang Chongxuan, and trembled, “You celestial beings, you cultivators, you’re human too... Stop deceiving me! I’m just an ant; I’m not worth your deception...”

With tears streaming down his face, his expression suddenly hardened. He quickly pulled out a white bone dagger from his sleeve, originally intended for fighting Yang Chongxuan, but now he plunged it into his own chest.

Wei Taizhen screamed, “No!”

Li Liu watched with a bemused smile, murmuring, “The most foolish method, yet the right choice.”

———

On this day, at the crumbling Treasure Mirror Mountain, the earth shook and split.

On the southern road, a young woman gazed ahead, softly addressing the fox spirit girl behind her, “My brother is the kindest, most friendly person, without a hint of wickedness... In any case, as you follow him as a maid, you must look after him well. I will teach you a secret method shortly. Once we reach Lion Peak, your cultivation will progress quickly, so don’t scare yourself.”

The fox spirit nodded vigorously, mumbling affirmatively.

Turning to glance back, she smiled faintly. 

The burly young man behind her, though pale, continued walking without issue, though blood still seeped from his clothing at his chest.

He smiled broadly.

Yet he couldn’t help but look back, unable to see his father’s figure, likely too afraid to follow this far.

Behind him were the man named Jiang Qujiang and the Rain Goddess.

The fox spirit girl, Wei Taizhen, found it strange—very strange. She was filled with confusion because, upon looking back at that man, it seemed her heart was no longer entangled with any feelings.

At the front, Li Liu walked, one hand behind her back, the other gently swaying in front of her, a ball of red threads twisting and gradually dissipating.

As the last bit of red thread turned to ash and vanished, Li Liu glanced down, sighing internally. Some loves sworn to life and death barely withstand scrutiny.

Not turning her head, she said to the Rain Goddess, “You don’t need to follow anymore. Bookmaster, remember the sixty-year agreement; don’t go dying easily. Otherwise, I have my ways to make you experience unimaginable suffering.”

The Rain Goddess, who should have been fearless about life and death, felt a surge of panic yet also a sense of relief. After nodding to acknowledge her orders, she seized the dazed Jiang Qujiang’s shoulder and flew away on the wind.

At the entrance to the Goat Intestine Palace, only one of the two little tricksters with wooden spears remained.

Chen Pingan smiled, slowly walking forward.

The little mouse spirit froze, quickly standing up, holding its wooden spear, and shouted, “Who are you? State your name!”

In truth, it had already recognized the person before it, but it felt the need to maintain the act.

Chen Pingan waved his hand, signaling it to drop the pretense, and asked, “Didn’t your ancestor get angry when he lost a box of military texts?”

The little trickster, if it still had the courage to remain in this Goat Intestine Palace, would have been willing to call him "immortal" out of respect.

The commotion at the Black River wasn’t small, and the pitiful fate of the Thunder God had likely become common knowledge.

Although the little trickster had morphed into a human form, its mouse spirit nature was still faintly detectable, as its cultivation was shallow.

Scratching its head, it said, “Reporting to the Sword Immortal, my ancestor was late returning. By then, I had already woken up by myself. Afraid my ancestor would suspect me, I slammed into the big door a couple more times, finally managing to knock myself out. I didn’t expect to wake up again and find my ancestor still hadn’t returned. So I steeled myself and slammed into it once more, and that’s how I managed to wait for my ancestor to return. Once he kicked me awake, I said I knew nothing and had just fainted. My ancestor didn’t care about me and rushed to check the underground tunnels, so I quickly snuck away and buried myself in the ground far away in the Goat Intestine Palace. Sure enough, when my ancestor couldn’t find me, he flew away.”

Chen Pingan sat on the steps, and the little mouse spirit hesitated before sitting down, keeping a distance.

It wanted to sit closer, to share some of that immortal aura, but it didn’t have the courage.

Chen Pingan smiled and asked, “What about that book I gave you?”

The little mouse spirit pointed to where it buried the book, happily saying, “Reporting to the Sword Immortal, it's well hidden there! I didn’t dare take it out, thinking I’d wait a while before looking at it carefully. Just like you said, if my ancestor finds it, it would cause big trouble. The book said, ‘A small impatience can lead to a big disruption in plans.’ Sword Immortal, is that how this saying works?”

Chen Pingan stifled a laugh, nodding, “That’s one way to use it.”

The little mouse spirit hugged its wooden spear, grinning.

It probably felt like it had accomplished something significant.

Chen Pingan, with hands tucked into his sleeves, slightly bent at the waist, turned to ask, “If possible, would you like to go outside and see the world?”

The little mouse spirit nodded eagerly, “Of course! My ancestor said that books outside, no matter who wrote them, are sold for a pittance. I want to buy some books to bring back!”

Chen Pingan asked, “And then return?”

The little mouse spirit nodded, a hint of shyness creeping onto its face. “My home is here.”

It didn’t dare sit like Chen Pingan, but curled up its knees, resting its arms on them, shrinking its body.

In a soft voice, it said, “I know that Sword Immortal doesn’t like my ancestor. If we meet, you might even want to kill him. So, I’m really happy that you didn’t encounter my ancestor during your two visits to our Goat Intestine Palace.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, taking out a flask of wine, “Care for a drink?”

The little mouse spirit shook its head, “If my ancestor sees you, it would be terrible.”

Chen Pingan said, “For the next ten days or so, this monster-hunting immortal won’t dare return.”

The little mouse spirit waved its hands vigorously, “Thanks for the Sword Immortal’s kind offer, but I won’t drink. I’ve heard that wine can burn your stomach.”

At this point, the little mouse spirit’s expression shifted to a hint of sorrow.

Chen Pingan nodded, uncorking the flask and taking a small sip, narrowing his eyes. This time, he only felt warmth and comfort, basking in the sun while sipping on wine, seated beside a little spirit who loved reading and taking notes. At that moment, it was as if he were living the life of an immortal.

Gathering its courage, the little mouse spirit cautiously asked, “Sword Immortal, are you here for training in our Ghost Valley?”

Chen Pingan responded, “I’ve also earned some money.”

Old troubles and new troubles, patching things up for another three years.

Such a life was truly good.

Moreover, the money he earned in this Ghost Valley was quite substantial.

After sipping a few more times, Chen Pingan put the flask away, stood up, and said, “I’m leaving.”

He donned a straw hat and removed the aged mask, revealing his true face.

The little mouse spirit glanced, quickly rising to stand straight, “I bid farewell to the young Sword Immortal!”

After saying this heartfelt farewell, the little mouse spirit felt quite clever!

Chen Pingan couldn’t help but smile, shaking his head helplessly, “You flatter me too much; how many times have you called me Sword Immortal? Your flattery still needs some work, so you should read more.”

The little mouse spirit, confused, thought, I wasn’t flattering you. But reading more is indeed necessary.

Now, its belongings had doubled from one book to two, making quite a fortune!

Chen Pingan laughed, “Have you ever seen a sword cultivator wielding a sword?”

The little mouse spirit shook its head vigorously. “Reporting to the Sword Immortal, I’ve never seen one in my life!”

Chen Pingan suddenly asked, “Aside from reading, do you enjoy cultivating?”

The little mouse spirit tightened its grip on the wooden spear, responding, “I do!”

Chen Pingan hesitated, then smiled, “Then I’ll share a saying I read. Would you like to hear it?”

The little mouse spirit took a deep breath, puffed out its chest, and seriously said, “Sword Immortal, please speak!”

Chen Pingan nearly swallowed his words back. 

At this point, he had lost any sense of authority, so he casually remarked, “The book says that cultivators cultivate strength to protect their Dao heart, not merely to toil for strength's sake.”

The little mouse spirit seemed to understand partly.

Chen Pingan adjusted his straw hat and was about to leave.

The little mouse spirit said, “Next time I see you, I’ll definitely drink!”

Chen Pingan replied with a smile, “No problem. You don’t know, but I’m not actually a Sword Immortal yet, just a swordsman. However, a swordsman always needs to drink to become a Sword Immortal.”

The little mouse spirit seemed to get it.

As Chen Pingan held his sword, it unsheathed itself and hovered before him.

He leapt onto the sword, soaring into the sky with a powerful presence, the sword aura piercing the heavens as he traveled through the world. 

(End of chapter)

 ### Chapter 576: I Can Also Part the Heavens with My Sword (Part One)

Chen Ping'an left the territory of the Narrow Path Palace, quickly sheathing his sword as he floated down into a place thick with miasma amidst the towering mountains. Earlier, he had looked down at the land; if he walked out of this mountainous area and traveled southeast for about fifty miles, he would reach the grand city known as Copper Smell City. Not far from there would be Qinglu Town, the residence of the disciples from the Pima Sect.

Learning to control the sword like an immortal was quite an interesting endeavor. The world’s sea of clouds was ever-changing and endlessly fascinating. Besides enjoying the view, it also provided a way to relieve boredom. After leaving the Narrow Path Palace, Chen Ping'an deliberately chose a section of the cloud sea that appeared as if it had been skillfully carved. He submerged his head into the clouds and slowly practiced sword control. Should any strange creatures or spirits in the mountains happen to glance up and witness this scene, they would probably think… was this headless Qi practitioner a bit deranged? Aside from this childish amusement, Chen Ping'an enjoyed fully immersing himself in the clouds, exposing only his head, and then waving his arms up and down, mimicking a water bird.

This was quite similar to how Pei Qian would rest her head on the counter in the shop on Dragon Riding Alley—no wonder they were a pair of master and disciple.

In this remote, desolate mountain range, where few ventured, the trees were twisted and sickly. As Chen Ping'an passed a cliff, he looked up to see a delicate plum tree growing in a crevice of the rocky wall, shrouded in mist. Below the cliff lay a large patch of scattered white bones, likely remnants of some grass or wood spirit that had hoped to achieve enlightenment. Having gained a bit of awareness, it had already begun to learn how to prey on small birds and beasts.

Generally speaking, it was the hardest for plants to become spirits. Most of these spirits would transform into human form, only to reach a dead end in their path of cultivation. Like the cute little spirits found among the pine and cypress bonsai in the Qingfu Town ferry terminal, they were destined to fail in their cultivation, merely relying on the innate longevity of plants to pass the time. Most were raised by cultivators, merely appearing charming and festive.

Thus, the elders under the locust tree in Li Zhu Cave Heaven would often tell ghost stories about the mythical creatures from the mountains and waters, meant to bewilder and scare the children. However, most elders would also add a line, saying that being born human was already a difficult feat, so one must cherish life. Otherwise, if one did not behave well in this life, they might be reborn as pigs or dogs in the next. When Chen Ping'an was young, he enjoyed sitting far away and listening to these stories. Liu Xianyang, who feared nothing, never liked hearing such tales, often dismissing them as mere tricks of ghostly spirits. So, it was usually Gu Can who accompanied Chen Ping'an to enjoy the shade under the locust tree, waiting until the woman from Mud Bottle Alley called out for Gu Can to eat or sleep before they left.

Chen Ping'an climbed the cliff, his fingers like hooks, digging into the rock face as he hung in the air. He then took out three snowflake coins, grasping them in his palm. Using the refining technique given to him by the River Goddess, he began to refine the snowflake coins and the spiritual energy contained within into drops of emerald green water, letting them drip from his fingers at the junction of the old plum tree and the rock crevice. After completing this, he gently tapped the cliff face, slowly floating down to the ground to continue his journey.

If a fellow cultivator found themselves in dire straits, desperately needing a sum of celestial money akin to life itself, they might see this plum tree exhibiting some unusual phenomenon and their first thought would be to wonder what it was worth. Ultimately, boldened by curiosity, they might take the risk to climb the cliff and cut it down. In the empty mountains, the sound of axes would echo. As for whether the plum tree's opportunity would be severed, they wouldn't care less. If their cultivation were a bit higher and their pockets were empty, encountering those two creatures on the iron chain bridge could lead to a danger no less than a struggle for the Dao itself.

Chen Ping'an never felt disgusted by the battles fought by cultivators to ascend, and even if their methods were ruthless, he could understand. What he truly disliked, even loathed, were certain immortals already occupying high positions—those who took all the advantages. Like the hidden dragon in the sea of clouds, they looked down from their heights, yet had no compassion for the mortal realm. To them, anyone beneath their level was like grass, easily suppressed or killed without a second thought, followed by a casual remark about the Dao being merciless, allowing them to maintain a heart of stone.

What kind of Dao was that?

Walking alone in the mountains, Chen Ping'an muttered to himself, “Is what one dislikes automatically wrong? Am I, Chen Ping'an, too domineering? Who do I think I am?”

He then asked himself, “Does kindness not command troops, and righteousness not command wealth?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

He felt that when ancient people spoke, they often said only half of the truth, which could not be considered genuine wisdom. Once certain truncated phrases were revered as standards by the world and treated as golden rules for living, they could indeed alleviate many troubles in life. It's not that they were bad, but they still fell short in some aspects.

For instance, the texts also mentioned: 

“Kindness does not command troops; after wielding great power, one must possess great benevolence.
Righteousness does not command wealth; after attaining great riches, one must have great righteousness.”

Chen Ping'an paused, leaped onto a high branch, sat on the tree, and took out a long-unused carving knife and bamboo slips, engraving these two sentences onto one slip.

After pondering for a moment, he also inscribed the words about cultivating the heart and strength that the little mouse spirit had mentioned at the Narrow Path Palace onto another slip.

After putting away the carving knife, he held one slip high and exclaimed with a brilliant smile, “Now, it’s truly as the ‘texts’ say!”

Ah well. 

It turned out that these were just some whimsical insights from Chen Ping'an himself.

He estimated that only the flatterers from the Ruined Mountain would take such sayings seriously.

Chen Ping'an carefully tucked away the two bamboo slips, feeling in great spirits.

Following that, he didn’t rush to Copper Smell City.

Instead, he took a few swigs from the wine jug he had carried out from the Narrow Path Palace, which still held quite a bit of wine.

Chen Ping'an began meticulously counting and calculating his possessions in his mind. This time, his experience in the Bone Marsh and the Ghostly Pit had yielded rich rewards.

However, the damage to his spring grass robe was considerable, and to properly repair it, he estimated he would need at least five or six thousand snowflake coins.

Back when he escaped from the encirclement at the Earth-Submerging Mountain alongside the scholar, he had to suppress his true strength to appear weaker to the enemy. He could only rely on his robe, which took a solid blow from the Mountain-Moving Ape. Later, near the Black River, during a fierce battle with the Thunder God of Jixiao Mountain, his spring grass robe was severely damaged by lightning, resulting in quite a hefty expense that left Chen Ping'an feeling a bit irritable.

He could only comfort himself, “Even the smallest burden in trade requires some capital; this mindset of expecting profits without investment is unacceptable.”

Moreover, enduring the torment in the Thunder Pool had been a true trial in the Ghostly Pit.

Though it was somewhat easier than the training in the bamboo building on Ruined Mountain, it still bore great benefits. The Thunder Pool was indeed a grueling prison of sorts, and enduring such hardship had its merits. Chen Ping'an had already noticed that his bones and soul had become slightly more resilient.

The Crow Ridge had yielded a snowflake robe, taken from the White Lady of the Greasy City. According to Fan Yunluo, the market price was two to three Grain Rain Coins.

If he returned it to the Greasy City, he could expect a premium of one or two Grain Rain Coins.

However, just thinking about that cunning White Lady put Chen Ping'an in a foul mood.

At that time, she had conjured a face to entice him, leaving him both furious and a little guilty.

In addition to having those two lower realm companions retrieve the five white bones from the Ghostly Pit, there were also the bones of over a dozen exquisite-looking female officials from the Greasy City among them.

As for how much he could sell them for in the Bone Marsh after leaving the Ghostly Pit, Chen Ping'an had no confidence.

He couldn't help but glance toward the south, wondering if those companions had managed to sell them at a high price.

The so-called one-month agreement.

In truth, Chen Ping'an had never taken it seriously; he only wanted to reassure them that they would receive their payment. Whether those companions, who had found it difficult to profit in the Ghostly Pit, would wait the full month or not, Chen Ping'an didn’t care.

Because those companions had sold the five sets of Greasy City white bones, regardless of whether they waited a month or not, Chen Ping'an would not be appearing at the Naiheguan market. If they didn’t wait and fled with the money, they would have to worry about the repercussions later; that was their concern. If they waited a month, even better; they could leave guilt-free, allowing that female cultivator from the Five Realms to break through the bottleneck into the Cave Dwelling Realm. That sum of celestial money would surely be more than enough to help her stabilize her new realm. As for the remaining surplus, whether the male cultivator could also break through depended solely on fate.

As for why Chen Ping'an was like this…

The reason was simple.

Just like when he had to retrieve those two sets of bones from the Summer Respite Goddess’s cellar—not for wealth, but because he had no interest in the bones of that Longxi Kingdom monarch and the Qingdezong female cultivator. His only thought was to find a place in their homeland to bury their bones together amid the lush green mountains.

Wishing that those who love in this world could come together and never be apart, wishing that those who passed on with unfulfilled hearts would be together in life and death.

The path of the Dao is long, and the journey of longevity is far. In the course of cultivation, aside from diligently practicing swordsmanship and boxing, and not fearing battles with the strong, doing these small things that others are reluctant to do is surely a source of great satisfaction in life.

From the Ruined Mountain's Moon Palace, there were indeed gains from the Summer Respite Goddess’s chamber and treasury.

He received over a thousand snowflake coins from the scholar.

However, Chen Ping'an felt that the most valuable item was that piece of cold iron, used as a “door,” which was meticulously crafted by the Mo family’s mechanism masters into a Moon Cold Palace.

As for the jars and bottles in the Moon Palace's inner chamber, Chen Ping'an remained quite attentive, thinking that after leaving the Bone Marsh and continuing his travels northward, who knew if he might encounter a few wealthy young ladies or mountain fairies? Perhaps one of them would be so taken that they would pay a high price for it? Zhu Lian had once sworn that there were no women who didn't want to look better in this world; if there were, it was merely because they hadn’t yet met a worthy man who could make them want to adorn themselves.

As for the large box of military books that the Ghost-catching Immortal had collected at the end of the Narrow Path Palace's tunnel…

Chen Ping'an hadn’t had the time to peruse them carefully. He planned to go through them one by one after settling down in Qinglu Town. They should all be books left behind by the two great dynasties and numerous vassal states that had been lost in the Bone Marsh. After a millennium of existence in the Narrow Path Palace, they would become one of the assets of Chen Ping'an's small shop, but he still needed to carefully select the best ones to keep in the Ruined Mountain's library.

Just imagining that in the future, when disciples from Ruined Mountain borrowed books from the library, they would hear the old man in the library say, “This is one of our mountain master’s harvests from his travels to the Bone Marsh,” and then embellish the tale, warning the disciples to be cautious while reading, as these were treasures found in the depths of a dragon's den and a tiger's lair…

Wouldn’t the disciples feel they needed to be more attentive while reading, and perhaps, when they felt weary under the light of their reading lamp, they would hold a bit of admiration for that young “mountain master” who had traversed countless mountains and rivers?

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but laugh at that thought.

Continuing to count his gains.

The same bookkeeper in a green robe at the Book Slip Lake could only think about minimizing losses.

But here in the Ghostly Pit, he could think about maximizing his profits.

Indeed, life was getting better by the day.

In the territory of Jixiao Mountain, he had unearthed five golden thunder whips of varying sizes.

The real value of these heavenly materials and earthly treasures, the golden thunder bamboo whips, was unknown for now.

However, why did that creature with two golden eagle heads claim to be a thief who had moved away the Thunder Pool?

Because of this, Chen Ping'an was worried there might be great upheavals in Jixiao Mountain, and after leaving the Black River, he deliberately avoided Jixiao Mountain.

In fact, Jixiao Mountain, like the Old Dragon Cave, might hold unexpected treasures for those brave enough to explore.

Of course, doing so would be akin to those lower realm companions, truly gambling their lives for profit.

At the temple by the Black River, he partnered with the scholar to split the spoils they obtained from the River Lord’s hidden treasury beneath the riverbed.

Six pieces of spiritual artifacts.

Chen Ping'an gave up the so-called treasured hairpin and only took the paltry sum of eight hundred snowflake coins from the water treasury. 

(PS: The eighteen thousand snowflake coins mentioned in the previous chapter have been corrected to eight hundred.)

In addition, in the small turtle water treasury, the scholar casually swept into the nearby object a pile of items similar to those kept in the Moon Palace.

Even after returning to Ruined Mountain from the Book Slip Lake, knowing that he had a connection to the Dao of Water, Chen Ping'an still refused that treasure which only benefited water cultivators.

It was true that sometimes, opportunities would fall from the sky.

However, Chen Ping'an did not trust that Yang Ningxing, who condensed all the evil of his heart into a pure “mustard seed” using profound techniques.

Yet, he was quite curious about how this unique method of the Cloud Palace’s feathered attire could refine the heart and spirit as if refining objects.

After finishing his calculations, Chen Ping'an realized that he had actually gained quite a lot from this trip to the Ghostly Pit.

Although he had discovered that the mountains and rivers near the Mirror Mountain had collapsed, likely due to Yang Chongxuan finally seizing the opportunity of the mirror, and that the Thunder Pool in Jixiao Mountain had been secretly moved, which was a tremendous fortune.

However, Chen Ping'an didn’t think that the great gains of others would make him envious.

In fact, the scholar, who was always scheming against him, had also gained considerably when he left the Ghostly Pit. Even without mentioning that Yang Ningxing had labored to make him a wedding garment in the Three Mountain Realm, just the golden fish raised in the Old Dragon Cave’s small water tank and the ancestral coin forged by a certain great hidden immortal of the Qingdezong were already significant returns.

But even knowing the truth, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t concern himself.

You walk your sunny path, and I’ll walk my narrow bridge.

You take your great fortune, and I’ll pick up my little trinkets.

Chen Ping'an suddenly smiled, unable to hide his delight, cheerfully saying, “Such trifles are truly welcome!”

Then Chen Ping'an shook his sleeves. “Besides, you all aren’t trifles; these are heaps of celestial money!”

Moreover, there were still those talismans that looked immensely valuable hidden within the sleeves of that robe he stripped from Yang Ningxing.

Chen Ping'an jumped down from the high branch, his steps light as he imitated the grand sweeping motions of Cui Dongshan, along with Pei Qian’s rhythm—how remarkably similar.

Chen Ping'an felt that he was indeed a bit carried away.

But so what? I am happy right now!

Chen Ping'an clutched the wine jug; after taking a swig, he didn’t even want to toss the jug away, tucking it into the nearby object. Feeling a bit regretful, he noted that he hadn’t encountered any strange creatures or spirits along the way, much like the situation at Copper Official Mountain. However, just as he was about to leave the mountain top, he suddenly spotted a commotion at a distance below, where two groups of people were in a standoff, weapons drawn.

Chen Ping'an swiftly made his way over, moving stealthily and concealing all his aura as he chose a hidden spot to hide.

On a crude, large vehicle—though calling it a vehicle was rather generous, as there was no covering around it—it resembled a wooden raft, with a throne seated atop it. A muscular man, towering like a giant, was perched on the throne, his fists as large as bowls. In one hand, he held a massive wine bowl custom-made for him, tilting his head back to drink heartily, wine spilling everywhere. His dense chest hair looked as if drenched in a heavy rain. At his feet lay a plethora of empty wine jugs, and next to the throne sat a delicate creature with pointed ears, holding a large bowl filled with wine, occasionally glancing stealthily at someone in the “enemy camp,” her eyes filled with flirtation.

The vehicle was carried by eight little spirits, who hoisted it on their shoulders.

Nearby, dozens of little spirit creatures donned iron armor, brandishing swords and spears, clamoring loudly.

Opposite this group of mountain spirits stood a dozen well-equipped soldiers, resembling sharp warriors of the mortal realm, armed with swords and crossbows.

At the forefront was a silver-armored ghost general, his face twisted with anger. Next to him stood a living man, shorter than him, who maintained a proud demeanor despite being surrounded by ghosts and spirits. He was dressed in a bright red official’s robe embroidered with a white heron on the front, wearing a white gauze shirt underneath, white socks, and black shoes, with a jade belt at his waist. This young “official” was pointing a finger at the vehicle, angrily cursing.

The muscular man, resembling a small mountain, heard the man's tirade and lightly kicked the girl beside him, asking in a low voice, “What’s he talking about?”

The delicate girl smiled and said, “He’s cursing you out, saying you’re not human.”

The large man was taken aback. “When was I ever human? Who among us is human with these skeletons from Copper Smell City? Only that pale-faced scholar thinks he’s human!”

The girl covered her mouth, giggling, and when the large man threw down his wine bowl, she quickly took it and passed her own bowl to him, playfully saying, “Sir, the scholars of Copper Smell City talk like that; it’s best you don’t understand. If you do, would you want to go to Copper Smell City and become an official?”

The large man grinned, “I’d love to be a little official under that schoolgirl Prime Minister, talking about all the nonsense from books during the day and having a grand battle at night, listening to her hum like she’s singing—just thinking about it is truly intoxicating.”

The ghost general listened closely, gripping the hilt of his sword with a dark expression, angrily retorting, “My lord the Prime Minister is like an immortal; how dare you, a mere beast with uncut hair, insult her?!”

The large man, unfazed, drank half a bowl of wine, spilling the other half, and smashed his bowl against the vehicle’s exterior. Leaning forward, he began to pick his teeth with his fingers, laughing, “I’m an oath brother with that little boy working under the Ghost-catching Immortal, and one of the righteous sons of the Mountain Moving Great Sage. What do a few woodcutters on your territory mean to me?”

The scholarly man shouted, “You old dog, stop pretending to be dumb! We’ve come to demand the new Jinshi! This person is the Prime Minister’s most valued scholar, so hand him over quickly, or Copper Smell City’s troops will descend upon you, and we won’t care about our neighborly relations anymore! Weigh carefully: is your life worth more than our Copper Smell City’s sharp blades and weapons!”

Chen Ping'an vaguely recognized the large man on the vehicle, who was accompanied by what looked like a mountain dog spirit.

However, the image was quite blurry, appearing and disappearing intermittently.

The boy working under the Ghost-catching Immortal? Could it be that mouse spirit who had hidden knives at the entrance of the Narrow Path Palace and then accidentally killed itself with a finger poke?

Chen Ping'an glanced at the vehicle and was concerned about the comparison; in contrast to the valuable vehicle from the Greasy City’s Fan Yunluo, this one was indeed too shabby, no wonder he had joined forces with that mouse spirit from the Narrow Path Palace.

The scholarly person being sought after by the Copper Smell City was undoubtedly that Yang Ningxing, who had been captured on the Ruined Mountain to take credit.

Chen Ping'an was more interested in the scholarly man.

It was clear that his departure from Copper Smell City was official business, but the subtle hints of schadenfreude in his expression suggested that deep down, he was hoping that this colleague who could compete with him for favor in the palace would be devoured by the mountain dog and turned into fertilizer for the mountain.

Cursing others without revealing their secrets, the large man was furious, his spit flying as he began to curse the Copper Smell City official for being a short-lived fellow who wouldn’t enjoy his riches.

The two sides exchanged harsh words for quite some time.

Chen Ping'an didn't see anyone making the first move.

In the end, they simply parted ways, returning home.

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but feel a bit impressed.

After patting his sword-holding gourd, he leaped down from the branch, tailing the group of Copper Smell City ghosts from a distance.

On the vehicle, the muscular man remained motionless, seemingly succumbing to drowsiness from the wine.

Once they returned to the cave dwelling, the vehicle slowly descended, and the delicate girl suddenly screamed.

It turned out that her supposedly invincible master had inexplicably dropped dead. This large man, who had transformed from a mountain dog spirit, had a single droplet of blood seeping from his brow.

As Chen Ping'an approached Copper Smell City, he took out the Pima Sect's token and hung it at his waist.

He also carried a large bundle on his back, which contained jars and bottles obtained from the Moon Palace and the water treasury of the Black River.

As for whether trading these would expose him, Chen Ping'an was not concerned at all; he actually hoped that the group of demons would follow the trail to seek revenge.

However, that Ghost-catching Immortal wouldn’t dare linger in his own Narrow Path Palace, let alone come to Copper Smell City to meet his demise.

Earlier, the sword-holding gourd had seemed reluctant to reveal itself to kill demons.

It was the flying sword that had slain that spirit with fifteen strikes.

Chen Ping'an adjusted his bamboo hat and covered his face with the old man's mask.

Earlier, at the water shrine by the Black River, the scholar had wanted to keep the young face as a memento.

Chen Ping'an hadn’t agreed.

When the scholar backed down, offering to buy it for a handsome price, Chen Ping'an replied that it was fine to buy it, but the price was ten Grain Rain Coins. Since they had already been through thick and thin together, it would be a bit too sentimental to discuss money, so he would offer an eleven percent discount.

Only then did the scholar reluctantly return the mask.

The scholarly man, who was such a generous brother, was truly a rare find in this world.

Copper Smell City, among the cities south of the Ghostly Pit, was a relatively large city, with tall walls and three gates. Because a significant part of the northern side of the city had been developed into a palace for the human monarch, a multitude of officials and ministers appointed by the city lord resided nearby. The city had over ten markets of various sizes, thriving with commerce. The Pima Sect's “Reassurance Collection” detailed that carrying the Pima Sect’s jade token into Copper Smell City not only removed any entry restrictions but also granted additional generous treatment for all transactions within the city.

This demonstrated that the city lord, who had established himself near Qinglu Town and was growing his business, was quite adept at managing… even as a ghost.

Indeed, the armored guards at the city gate, upon seeing the jade token at Chen Ping'an’s waist, not only refrained from charging him a fee and questioning him but also changed their demeanor to one of humility, bowing and smiling, collectively congratulating him, “Wishing the immortal master abundant wealth,” leaving Chen Ping'an momentarily taken aback. After a moment’s contemplation, he didn’t leave hastily but instead adopted the manner of a seasoned traveler from Qinglu Town, tossing a snowflake coin to one of the ghostly officers in charge of the city gate. The latter hurriedly caught the coin with both hands, biting it lightly, and instantly broke into a broad smile.

Inside Copper Smell City, the city was known for three large districts, one of which was the Daughter District, filled with numerous brothels and entertainment venues. After all, the women of Copper Smell City were exceptionally beautiful. Aside from a few businesses focused on physical pleasures, the Daughter District also engaged in human trafficking, selecting some seemingly delicate girls and marking their prices. Historically, there had been wandering immortals who spotted the innate talents of young girls from Copper Smell City and took them away from the Ghostly Pit. It was said that one such girl, possessing pure Yin energy, ascended to the realm of Earth Immortals alongside the benefactor who saved her from peril.

Chen Ping'an had profound insights regarding this; during his journey from the Book Slip Lake northward, he had unintentionally passed a gold and silver shop in the county town, where two young assistants, seemingly oblivious to their fortune, were observed by two hidden, wandering immortals. Among them, a more experienced old cultivator chose the seemingly simple, unremarkable boy as his disciple, while a slightly less powerful cultivator chose the clever boy as his student.

There was also a Barter District, where one could exchange goods. The various treasures from the Ghostly Pit, spirit herbs, jade bones, and various relics obtained from chance encounters could be traded here, allowing people to acquire what they needed. After all, spirits also had their own strictures in cultivation, and with each realm ascended, their lifespan extended.

Lastly, there was a Golden Powder District, dedicated to trading the precious treasures collected by the scholarly Prime Minister. Of course, wandering immortals could also bring their treasures to sell to the city lord’s sister.

This was the destination of Chen Ping'an's journey to Copper Smell City; he intended to act as a shopkeeper and practice thickening his skin.

Throughout the journey, the spirits walked freely in broad daylight, while the living—men, women, and children—had no fear, enjoying shopping and leisure.

It seemed that this small world of the Ghostly Pit had somehow refined the sunlight of the vast realm, making it no longer harmful to spirits.

The Golden Powder District was small, with stores lining a street, where many talented scholars yet to achieve fame resided.

The scholarly Prime Minister’s thoughts were indeed imaginative.

Chen Ping'an arrived at the first shop at the street corner, where the shopkeeper was a beautifully dressed young female ghost, accompanied by two pale-faced child spirits.

Upon seeing Chen Ping'an, who wore the jade token of the Pima Sect, the two little ones seemed a bit frightened.

Copper Smell City had seen many disasters throughout its history, often caused by these foreign immortals running rampant within the city, leading to countless deaths.

The young female ghost, however, maintained her composure, politely asking, “Old immortal master, are you here to buy or sell? Since my shop can open on the street, you can be sure our goods are genuine.”

Chen Ping'an cleared his throat, chuckling hoarsely, “If I’m coming from over there, doesn’t that mean I’m at the end of the street?”

The young girl smiled sweetly, unfazed. After all, business here was always up to the customers’ discretion.

The two originally timid little ones exchanged glances and smiled, realizing that this old immortal in the bamboo hat could even tell jokes.

Chen Ping'an looked around the shop at the various antique curios on the shelves. Few exuded spiritual energy; most were relics unearthed from the ancient battlefield of the Bone Marsh, akin to the armor and weapons found in Crow Ridge—one well-maintained and shining like new, while the other was rusted and weathered. Moreover, treasures from the mountains couldn’t simply be called spiritual artifacts just because they held some spiritual energy; genuine artifacts needed to be meticulously refined and crafted to nurture Qi practitioners and warm their Qi vessels. Only then could they be considered spiritual artifacts. Furthermore, they had to be able to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and refine it into purity, which was no simple task. Thus, the so-called “heaven and earth bestowing form, objects possessing spirits” meant that many treasures hidden in palaces were considered priceless by mundane scholars, yet viewed as worthless by high-ranking cultivators for this very reason.

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 577: I Can Also Split the Sky with My Sword (Part Two)

However, the store’s treasured item is undeniably a spirit weapon—a heavy iron arrow without feathers. One can only imagine that its owner must have had incredible strength in life, a true battlefield warrior. The arrow’s tip is stained with blood, dark and conspicuous, a testament to its past; the blood has not faded over the years and is still soaked into the arrow itself.

The ghostly shopkeeper, seeing this man bow his head before the arrow, smiled and said, “Oh, wise old master, your eyesight is indeed commendable. This item is called the ‘Mountain-Breaking Arrow.’ It once belonged to a formidable general from the Longxi Kingdom, a true enemy of thousands on the battlefield. He was a martial artist of renown, and his fated item was a Bow of Mountain-Breaking, complemented by twelve Mountain-Breaking Arrows. One arrow could shatter a mountain peak, its power is astonishing. This particular Mountain-Breaking Arrow is especially rare, for its tip is stained with the blood of a rival general, having pierced through his eye. Thus, the blood has not dispersed for a millennium, and my master has named it the ‘Eye-Piercing Arrow.’ For ordinary ghostly beings and mountain spirits, even just a glance at this arrow is enough to cause pain to their eyes. If the wise old master were to purchase it, traversing mountains and rivers with this arrow, you would surely ward off evil spirits and be free from ghostly intrusions.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and asked, “And where is the Bow of Mountain-Breaking now?”

The ghostly shopkeeper sighed, “In the heart-wrenching battle at the Bone Marsh, the bow was directly pulled until it snapped. Not only the bowstring broke, but the bow itself was also destroyed.”

Chen Ping’an lamented, “What a tragic slaughter.”

The shopkeeper chuckled, “If not for such circumstances, we wouldn’t have the chance to be reborn as these ghostly beings. We must thank those fearless warriors of the battlefield for that.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “I will take another look around.”

The ghostly shopkeeper did not press him further, allowing the old man in the conical hat to leave the shop.

After browsing all the stores on this street, Chen Ping’an found a similar situation in each: each shop possessed a single treasured spirit weapon. For example, at the last shop, there was a well-crafted iron pipa (a type of Chinese lute). 

The other odds and ends were rather mediocre. Even if Chen Ping’an wanted to buy them at a low price to resell elsewhere, he could not find anything of value. It seemed that the real treasures had already been collected by that woman who acted as a minister in the palace.

Chen Ping’an had learned a thing or two about spotting good deals from Ma Duyi and the old ghost of Shujian Lake. 

However, after seeing so many good items, he still lacked the confidence to discern just how good they truly were; his skills and experience just weren’t sufficient yet.

Finally, Chen Ping’an returned to the first shop he had visited. The two little ghosts inside were no longer afraid of him and were basking in the sun on the doorstep, merely shifting aside to make room for him.

The ghostly shopkeeper greeted him with a smile. “Did the wise old master find anything of value in our Golden Powder Workshop?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “I couldn't find any items that were both reasonably priced and caught my eye.”

She glanced at the large package on Chen Ping’an’s back and asked, “Are you considering parting with something to sell?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Just trying my luck. I wonder if the shopkeeper would be interested.”

She laughed, “Let’s take a look first. If there’s something truly worth it, I’m not afraid to spend money in this shop.”

Chen Ping’an then unwrapped his package, gently placing it on the counter, revealing item after item.

This was merely one-third of the belongings from the Summer Goddess's boudoir and the Water Lord's palace.

It was evident that Chen Ping’an had thoroughly scoured the area; he left no stone unturned.

The shopkeeper’s expression was peculiar at first.

To her surprise, many of the items were meant for women’s quarters: powder boxes, makeup mirrors, intricately engraved silver boxes with mandarin duck motifs, and hair ornaments, as large as a fist but exquisitely carved with vibrant peonies—all hundreds of them…

This older foreign master was truly unashamedly lustful!

The man in the conical hat seemed to sense something was amiss and began to rummage through his things, finally pulling out a few relatively normal luxury items.

The ghostly shopkeeper’s anger and embarrassment seemed to ease slightly.

When Chen Ping’an produced a pair of golden chopsticks, her eyes changed slightly.

She was more excited about this than when she saw that exquisitely crafted gold hairpin.

In the end, Chen Ping’an only revealed half of the items in his package, creating a scattered mound on the counter, and asked, “Did the shopkeeper find anything appealing?”

The ghostly shopkeeper casually swept her gaze over the items, pausing briefly at a water-colored porcelain bottle, seeming mildly interested, but overall disappointed.

Chen Ping’an sighed, “Since neither of us has found anything worthwhile, I guess this trip to the Copper Stench City was in vain.”

The shopkeeper, noticing that the old man was about to pack up, gently extended a finger, pressing it against the top of the water-colored porcelain bottle, and spoke, “Old master, how much is this little porcelain bottle? I find it cute and plan to buy it for myself.”

Chen Ping’an glanced at the pink-colored bottle, feigning a smirk, and said, “That? Among my treasures, it’s the least valuable. I’ll gift it to the shopkeeper.”

He was certain it held no real value; well-bred young ladies or noblewomen might like it, but it would only fetch a few dozen or a hundred taels of silver. The shopkeeper’s interest in it was merely a tactic to undervalue the rest. He wouldn’t be fooled so easily; he wasn’t lacking in business savvy.

As for cunningness and depth of character, that ghostly shopkeeper from Copper Stench City could not compare to a scholar.

Thus, Chen Ping’an began to stuff the items back into his package, showing clear determination to leave.

As expected, the shopkeeper seemed unable to hide her growing anxiety and asked, “Old master, my shop hasn’t had any business for a long time. How about this: if I buy all the items in your package for ninety snowflake coins, what do you think?!”

Chen Ping’an cast a sidelong glance at the shopkeeper, who looked pained at the idea of parting with snowflake coins, and pushed the pink porcelain bottle with his hand, continuing without missing a beat, “I’m not a beggar either. Just take this one; the rest of the real treasures, I’ll seek out buyers with real money elsewhere. I refuse to believe there isn’t someone with good taste in this vast Copper Stench City.”

The shopkeeper, seemingly a bit annoyed and embarrassed, did not reach for the porcelain bottle, nor did she attempt to keep the old man from leaving. She allowed him to pack up everything he had taken out and put them back in his package. When she saw him not taking the porcelain bottle, the old man was quite unceremonious, holding it in his hand, and finally stepped over the threshold, leaving.

Once the grumpy old man was gone, the shopkeeper muttered to herself for a while before quickly waving her hand, summoning a little ghost girl to her side, saying, “Go follow that man. If he turns back toward our shop, don’t say anything. If he keeps walking and seems unlikely to return to the Golden Powder Workshop, approach him and say we’re willing to negotiate the price.”

About a quarter of an hour later, the little ghost girl rushed back to the shop, her face scrunched up in distress, almost on the verge of tears, “Sister Zhenguan, I quietly followed that old gentleman all the way, and he really didn’t notice me. I followed for a long time, but close to the Daughter's Workshop, he turned into a small alley. I didn’t dare to follow too closely, afraid he would see me if I turned too quickly. After peeking, when he left the alley, I ran in, but by the time I got out, he was already gone. Sister Zhenguan, that old gentleman disappeared just like that! I ran back and forth on that street several times, but I still couldn’t find him…”

The little ghost girl covered her face with her hands and, at the mention of her plight, began to sob.

The ghostly shopkeeper felt both worried and pained, quickly crouching down to pat the little girl’s head gently, soothingly saying, “Alright, alright, it’s not a big deal. Don’t cry, don’t cry.”

The boy ghost standing by made a face, relishing her misfortune, saying, “Sister Zhenguan, if you had let me follow, that old man wouldn’t have escaped! That silly Sparrow girl, you know better than anyone.”

The little girl ghost, who had just managed to stop crying, erupted into loud wails once more.

The ghostly shopkeeper glared fiercely at the little boy, then went behind the counter and retrieved a silver bell, tossing it to the little ghost. “I can’t leave the shop right now. Take this token, and make sure you don’t lose it. Then hurry to the northern palace gate and inform General Chu on watch. Tell him that a foreign old master visited the Golden Powder Workshop earlier, and he has many treasures on him. Make sure the minister doesn’t miss out and ideally meets that immortal master in person.”

The boy ghost nodded vigorously, “Alright, Sister Zhenguan, don’t worry! I’m much more reliable than that Sparrow girl!”

The little girl ghost continued to cry even harder.

The ghostly shopkeeper pointed outside, glaring at the troublemaking little boy, “Hurry and disappear!”

“Understood!” 

The boy dashed out immediately.

A moment later, the shopkeeper, who had been comforting the little girl on the ground, turned her head in disbelief.

Outside the shop, a tall woman walked in, holding the motionless little boy, smiling as she entered and said, “Zhenguan, no need to look for me. Recently, the news in Copper Stench City has been tight. The city lord has sent people to closely monitor the comings and goings of all suspicious individuals. So, once that foreign old master stepped into the Golden Powder Workshop, I was already notified.”

The woman set the little boy down, sniffing the air with delight, and smirked, “Oh, what a rich aura of treasures! Zhenguan, you really missed out on a great deal!”

The young ghost Zhenguan felt guilty, “I just wanted to help the minister haggle. I didn’t expect that old man to have such a bad temper and simply leave in a huff.”

The woman waved her hand, “It’s fine. As long as he’s still in Copper Stench City, we can find him. I’ve already sent someone to invite him over.”

This woman was Tang Jinxi, the younger sister of the city lord of Copper Stench City, known for her childlike approach in crafting a court and organizing the imperial examinations over the years.

City Lord Tang Jingqi was an old Golden Core ghost, but he had rarely engaged in battles, which was not surprising. In the southern region, Pu Rang was the strongest in combat. If not for his own misdeeds, he would have long become an astonishing Jade Pure realm ghostly sword cultivator. As for the other city lords, aside from the one near Lan She Town, no one had reached the Nascent Soul realm, and none were even close to it. It was only further north that there was a Nascent Soul city lord—the hidden support of the Summer Goddess, a powerful entity that never fell, and one of the three ghostly generals under a renowned general who had died in battle for the Divine Strategy country. This general had personally visited the Golden Powder Workshop before but had only taken a glance at the Mountain-Breaking Arrow on display. Not only did he not take it by force, but the Copper Stench City also sought to voluntarily return it, which the Golden Core ghost general declined.

Tang Jinxi smiled, “Once he arrives, just tell him that I’m the head of this Golden Powder Workshop, the one who truly manages the finances. If my identity is leaked, that immortal master will surely drive the prices sky-high.”

The ghostly shopkeeper nodded with a smile.

Tang Jinxi glanced at the two little ghosts and playfully scolded, “You two fools, go play somewhere else.”

The two little ones hurriedly dashed out of the shop.

A tall figure suddenly appeared inside the shop, the surrounding air rippling with dark energy.

Tang Jinxi was momentarily stunned and then smiled, “Brother, what brings you here? If I’m not mistaken, this is your first visit to my Golden Powder Workshop.”

The young ghost who was called Zhenguan had already knelt, trembling as she spoke, “I pay my respects to the city lord.”

The middle-aged man said, “I came here to tell you that aside from doing business with that man, you best not entertain any other thoughts.”

Tang Jinxi chuckled, “Is it just an old man? What do you fear, do you think I would take a fancy to him? He’s not a young handsome lad; I have no such inclinations.”

Tang Jingqi sighed, “This person merely uses some tricks to obscure his true self. If the intelligence is correct, he should be the young sword immortal who has given Fan Yunluo and the mountain spirits a tough time. I just received news that the mountain dog was also killed, pierced through the skull by a flying sword, quietly, without making a sound.”

Tang Jinxi licked her lips.

Tang Jingqi grew serious, “I usually don’t hold your actions against you, but this time is crucial. A small mistake could lead to a disaster for half of Copper Stench City. If you dare to act rashly, don’t blame me for locking you up for a hundred years!”

Tang Jinxi looked wronged, “If it’s such a big deal, why don’t you handle it yourself?”

Tang Jingqi laughed in exasperation, “Me? What for? To let it slip that I’m secretly plotting to eradicate the other great demons? Or to appear ambitious and swallow up the nearby cities? Or to sit here, munching on melon seeds, haggling with him? Since he doesn’t plan on revealing himself and merely came to our city to do business, even you know to hide your identity to avoid him raising the prices; how can I negotiate here? If he offers a small summer coin for an item, am I to purchase it for a grain rain coin? Otherwise, shouldn’t we, Copper Stench City, be the ones disrespecting a young sword immortal?”

Tang Jingqi pointed at his younger sister, who looked ashamed, “From now on, understand this: it’s just business. Don’t overthink it, and don’t try too hard to please. But if the other party is aggressive, don’t be too fearful; our Copper Stench City has an agreement with Qinglu Town. The disciples of the Pima Sect will certainly not sit idly by.”

Tang Jinxi pouted, “I know.”

Tang Jingqi turned to glance at the young ghost Zhenguan, reminding her, “Make sure to remind her not to get too infatuated. Our Copper Stench City’s minister isn’t worthy of a young sword immortal.”

Tang Jinxi stomped her foot, “Brother, is that how you speak of your own sister?!”

The city lord’s spirit hurried away.

About half an hour later, a ghostly woman dressed plainly, deliberately avoiding court attire, led the old master to the corner shop of the Golden Powder Workshop.

Zhenguan felt nervous.

Tang Jinxi had already positioned herself at the shop entrance, hands clasped behind her back, one hand lightly gesturing to signal the true shopkeeper behind her to stay calm.

After the woman explained the situation, Tang Jinxi turned to the old man in the conical hat, smiling brightly, “Old master, why did you pass by the Daughter's Workshop without entering? Hiding away to drink, making it hard for us to find you.”

Tang Jinxi then began her self-introduction, “I am the head of all the shops in this Golden Powder Workshop. Zhenguan here lacks discernment and doesn’t have much money, so it’s best that I handle the business with the old master.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Very well, I hope you won’t take advantage of me. This old bones of mine can’t withstand too much pressure, and I can’t handle even a single harsh word.”

Tang Jinxi silently cursed but kept her smile broad, “The youngest shop in the Golden Powder Workshop has been around for four or five hundred years. Each of our gold-lettered signs attracts countless return customers, so please rest assured, old master.”

Chen Ping’an entered the shop, and Tang Jinxi stood shoulder to shoulder with Zhenguan behind the counter.

The woman who had led Chen Ping’an stood at the door.

Chen Ping’an unwrapped his package, taking out items one by one and placing them on the counter.

Again, he revealed only one-third of the contents.

A dazzling array of treasures spilled forth.

Tang Jinxi picked up each item, putting them down one by one. When she saw the exquisitely carved golden flower ornament surrounded by a hundred peonies, she trembled slightly, smiling and saying, “What a beautiful item! Even in the marketplaces of foreign dynasties, just based on this exquisite craftsmanship, it must be worth at least ten thousand taels of silver. After all, this was once a beloved item of a beautiful empress from the Anting Kingdom. It’s said that if you crush snowflake coins and sprinkle them on the flower petals, some miraculous phenomena will occur. Hmm, I’ll offer a small summer coin.”

Tang Jinxi then picked up the pair of golden chopsticks, examining them closely. She tapped them together, listening intently, then nodded, “Indeed, this item has historical records. It was a gift from the last emperor of the Que Mountain Kingdom to the renowned minister Song Jing at a banquet, meant to honor Song Jing’s integrity. The chopsticks were crafted by celestial artisans and are not made of ordinary gold but contain materials from the mountains. When struck, they emit sounds that resonate with ‘integrity’ and ‘uprightness.’ Song Jing was indeed worthy of this item, leading troops into battle as a civil minister and achieving remarkable feats on the battlefield. It’s a pity that one person’s strength can hardly resist the tide of fate.”

Chen Ping’an suddenly interjected, “In that case, I won’t sell it.”

Tang Jinxi was taken aback, “Old master, why is that? I’m willing to offer the same price of a small summer coin. Moreover, these chopsticks cannot fetch such a high price elsewhere. Since I’ve offered the historical context before you set your price, it shows the sincerity of our Golden Powder Workshop. That’s truly treating people with integrity.”

“Your sincerity is indeed commendable.” 

Chen Ping’an nodded, smiling, “However, I intend to give these chopsticks as a gift.”

Tang Jinxi was left with no choice but to back down. Normally, she would have been tempted by these chopsticks, offering around fifty snowflake coins, considering it a savings on her part. 

In the end, of the one-third of the items in his package, including the golden flower ornament, Tang Jinxi purchased roughly half, totaling nine small summer coins. Considering the premium of small summer coins over snowflake coins, it came to around nine hundred and thirty snowflake coins.

Among them, an old gilded incense burner, which Chen Ping’an couldn’t discern its significance, surprisingly fetched the highest price. Tang Jinxi didn’t elaborate on its origins, merely stating she was willing to pay four small summer coins. Chen Ping’an raised the price by one, and she hesitated but ultimately agreed. Once she had Zhenguan pack away the incense burner, Tang Jinxi suddenly laughed heartily, feeling elated. Chen Ping’an knew he had undersold it, but it didn’t matter; they were making money based on their discerning eyes.

In fact, including this package, the remaining items didn’t necessarily mean they were worthless. Leaving the Ghostly Marsh and the Bone Marsh, they still had opportunities to exchange them for real gold and silver.

Chen Ping’an was determined to return to Copper Stench City and reward the gate guard ghost with a snowflake coin. Surely, he had been lucky this time at the Golden Powder Workshop; it had been a bountiful trip.

After securing his bag, Chen Ping’an donned his conical hat again, took out the pink porcelain jar from his sleeve, placed it on the counter, and smiled at the young ghost, “Consider this a lucky gift, a token of goodwill to wish the shopkeeper prosperous business.”

The young ghost, Zhenguan, quickly glanced at Tang Jinxi, and seeing her remain unreactive, she accepted it with a smile.

Chen Ping’an left the Golden Powder Workshop and, upon exiting Copper Stench City’s gate, tossed a snowflake coin to the gate guard, who was overjoyed and bowed repeatedly to thank him.

Chen Ping’an headed toward Qinglu Town.

There, he sought a place to rest, planning not only to recuperate but also to sketch a few golden material shorter-distance talismans.

After all, in the Ghostly Marsh, a place deemed safe, Lan She Town hardly counted; only the Pima Sect's Zhu Quan, stationed in Qinglu Town, could provide that sense of security.

Qinglu Town was not far from Copper Stench City, but due to the winding mountain paths, Chen Ping’an traveled on foot without using his sword. When he could finally see the outline of Qinglu Town, he let out a small sigh of relief.

After leaving the shop, Tang Jinxi lightly tapped the counter with her fingers, her face beaming with joy.

It’s said that inviting a deity is easy, but sending them off is hard. Not only had she successfully invited a deity, but she had also made a profit, and a legitimate one at that.

However, Tang Jinxi felt a bit anxious, fearing her usually stern brother might scold her for “overdoing it.”

The moment Chen Ping’an left the city gate, Tang Jingqi arrived at the Golden Powder Workshop.

Tang Jinxi’s gaze drifted uncertainly.

Tang Jingqi chuckled, “Very good, you handled it well and even managed to make a good deal. Quite rare, indeed. You’re helping Copper Stench City earn money.”

Tang Jinxi felt relieved.

With a smug expression, she asked, “Brother, do you think that fellow guessed my identity?”

Tang Jingqi smirked, “At first, he might not have been sure, but by the time he left the shop, he would have figured it out.”

Tang Jinxi furrowed her brows, “Where did I expose myself? As the head of the Golden Powder Workshop, knowing so much about historical details shouldn’t be a giveaway, right? My female officials have read hundreds of years' worth of books and can recite them fluently.”

Tang Jingqi glanced at the young ghost Zhenguan and pointed at her.

The fair-skinned young ghost turned pale with fright and plopped to the ground.

Tang Jinxi gasped, realizing, “That old master intentionally tested Zhenguan when he offered the porcelain jar?”

Tang Jingqi, seemingly in a good mood, chuckled, “Get up; it’s not a big deal. It’s something that’s hard to conceal. For a Qi practitioner, the truth often doesn’t matter as much as the suspicions in their minds. Besides, any worldly practitioner from outside, if they can reach such a realm, won’t be around for much longer. The words and actions of the two of you, along with the final outcome, have been the best. As the city lord and your brother, I have no reason to demand more from you.”

Before leaving, Tang Jingqi instructed his sister, “Remember to reward her with a small summer coin. If only you could spread your generosity toward the women of Copper Stench City just as you do toward the men.”

Tang Jinxi rolled her eyes.

Meanwhile...

Chen Ping’an had already taken off his disguise, entering Qinglu Town. It wasn’t large, and in fact, it was even smaller than the Naiheguan marketplace.

It comprised merely two intersecting main streets, with the total number of buildings not exceeding a hundred, and there were no grand mansions or estates.

The streets were sparsely populated, but there were indeed tea stalls and taverns, and the people selling tea and alcohol were surprisingly beautiful women. They were likely women making a living from Copper Stench City, many of whom seemed to have some aptitude for cultivation but were unable to become Pima Sect practitioners.

Qinglu Town had two celestial inns, one to the north and the other to the south. The northern one was quite expensive, costing ten snowflake coins for a night, while the southern one only charged one.

When Chen Ping’an inquired if the price difference was due to the aura, the woman at the northern inn smiled brightly and sincerely replied that there was no difference. It was just that the northern inn was closer to the sect leader's dwelling. Wealthy immortals tended to flock to this place, and Master Du often resided there, making it likely to run into him.

Thus, Chen Ping’an turned and headed south.

The woman blinked, seemingly surprised.

Those who could reach Qinglu Town, whether cultivators or pure martial artists, tended to be affluent. No one was in need; there were only those with money and those with even more. The most precious face in the world couldn’t be tossed aside for a mere nine snowflake coins.

After Chen Ping’an rented a room, he started to exchange items from his package for fresher ones, placing them into his bag.

He planned to return to Copper Stench City’s Golden Powder Workshop in a few days.

This was like catching a fat sheep and pulling its wool.

Once this opportunity was gone, there wouldn’t be another.

Having completed these tasks, Chen Ping’an continued to repair his spring grass robe with a few snowflake coins.

About a cup of tea later, he stopped this task.

Repairing the robe wasn’t merely a matter of spending money; it required meticulous work.

Chen Ping’an began practicing the Sword Furnace Stand, circulating the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops, which he still could not fully break through.

An hour later, Chen Ping’an took a big gulp of the deep spring water from the Sword Nurturing Gourd, beginning to refine the water vapor essence to replenish his water residence.

After just over an hour, he managed to refine three drops of “spring water” and handed them to the three green-clothed boys in his water residence.

Chen Ping’an’s shallow cultivation still consumed a lot of time. When he entered seclusion, he would be utterly oblivious to worldly matters, hence the saying that one does not know the seasons in the mountains.

When Chen Ping’an took the opportunity to rest, immersing himself in his thoughts, his Yin spirit transformed into a mustard seed and roamed the water residence, only to encounter the resentful gazes of those little boys.

It seemed they were saying that with such mediocre talent, one should work even harder—“Dumb birds fly early.” Why, after constructing such a magnificent residence for key points, had he barely trained, not even “fishing three days and sunbathing for two,” but rather “fishing one day and sunbathing for a year”?

Chen Ping’an felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and hurriedly left the water residence.

The pure Qi transformed fire dragon, condensed from pure martial energy, silently observed Chen Ping’an outside the water residence door.

Chen Ping’an remained silent, feeling despondent.

The fire dragon flicked its head and tail, quickly darting away.

Years ago, a golden figure dressed in scholar's robes and wielding a sword stood atop its head, patrolling the lands together, expanding their territory and dominating all, as if they were the perfect balance of civil and military.

Chen Ping’an collected his thoughts and withdrew his internal vision. Once he regained his bearings, he sat at the table, his gaze lowered, lost in silence.

In truth, it was not easy to convince others, nor even oneself.

So why bother reasoning?

A bowl of common food, a volume of martial arts.

Was it worth it?

The price paid, no matter how enormous, had already damaged the foundations of the path. But was his choice truly the right one? What if it was wrong?

Chen Ping’an was not entangled in the first question, which had long had an answer, nor the second, destined to remain uncertain.

However, he was afraid, his heart fluttering, for he did not understand why he was even contemplating these matters.

Chen Ping’an suddenly took a deep breath, stood up from the table, leaving his seat, his azure robes fluttering as he closed his eyes, beginning to walk inverted, practicing the principles of the earth and sky.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 578: I Can Also Open the Sky with a Sword (Part 3)

On the verdant Copper Green Lake, a green bamboo raft floated gently. The young man from San Lang Temple, Yuan Xuan, was still fishing. This time, without any outsiders around, he felt even more relaxed and carefree. Accompanying him were a female martial artist and an elderly sword cultivator, both holding their own fishing rods.

Yuan Xuan had only just returned to this spot and felt a little disappointed. The young wanderer, who had supposedly made a great name for himself in Ghostly Hollow Valley, had not shown up.

He glanced at the still surface of the lake and turned to ask, "Sister Fan, Grandpa Liu, didn't you say that person was just an ordinary martial artist? Why does everyone in Qinglu Town say he’s a sword cultivator with an unfathomable level of skill? They’re all guessing whether he has reached the Golden Core stage or if he’s a hidden, terrifying Nascent Soul sword immortal?"

The woman surnamed Fan looked a bit awkward. "He should be just a martial artist."

The old man, who was more knowledgeable, chuckled, "Little Fan and the cultivators from Qinglu Town might not be wrong. Some oddities exist in the world that are both Qi cultivators and purely martial artists. However, these prodigies often struggle as they advance. For instance, if a martial artist has reached the far-traveling realm, or a cultivator has finally attained the Nascent Soul stage, they will face significant difficulties. Unless they possess great willpower and decisively abandon one of their paths, it’s almost impossible to reach the top; they’ll only end up fighting against themselves, stuck at a dead end on both paths."

Yuan Xuan exclaimed, "If he really is a far-traveling martial artist just one step away from the legendary mountain peak, and possesses the spells and abilities of a Nascent Soul cultivator, wouldn’t that make him unbeatable across the continent?"

"Unbeatable? Not quite." The old man shook his head, smiling. "Ordinary Jade Purity realm immortals, as long as they aren’t sword cultivators, would indeed have a headache facing such a rare specimen. But if it’s a sword immortal, or an immortal cultivator, they would handle it with ease."

Yuan Xuan’s thoughts leaped far and wide, and with a laugh, he asked, "Grandpa Liu, you’re a sword cultivator. Can you explain why, out of the countless weapons in the world, swords are considered the most formidable and are praised as having the greatest killing power? Don’t try to fool me; I know that sword cultivators require a lot of money, and the innate sword embryos are extremely rare among Qi cultivators. Those two reasons can’t be the whole story."

The old man laughed heartily. "That’s an ancient tale, very old indeed."

He fell silent, lifting his hand to point at the high sky above.

Yuan Xuan looked up and nodded. The inquisitive young man from San Lang Temple, usually eager to dig for answers, surprisingly stopped asking questions and began to fish quietly.

However, Yuan Xuan still felt a bit restless. After hesitating for a moment, he extended three fingers towards the old man.

The old man shook his head and pointed even higher.

Yuan Xuan retracted two fingers, leaving only one.

The old man smiled, still shaking his head.

Finally, Yuan Xuan began to fish at ease.

In contrast, the female martial artist, who was older than Yuan Xuan, looked confused, not understanding the silent exchange between the two.

Half an hour later, still with no catch in sight, Yuan Xuan tossed a handful of bait into the water. Although the surface appeared calm, the currents beneath were complex. The young man wasn’t throwing his bait around carelessly. He casually asked, "I heard that the old tortoise on the Black River has raised a pair of golden fish that have lived for at least fifteen hundred years. Grandpa Liu, if I tell Uncle Du, can we go over and buy one from that old tortoise?"

The old man patiently explained, "Unless you kill it, it’s impossible to buy such a spiritual creature. However, to successfully kill an old tortoise that has survived this long in Ghostly Hollow Valley is quite difficult. Unless the head of the Zhu Sect personally intervenes, if it hides deep in its lair, even Uncle Du would have a hard time finding it."

Yuan Xuan sighed, "Killing it is out of the question; even if I could, I wouldn’t. Everything in nature has its own order. Cultivators go against the current; creating more killings just doesn’t seem right. I really don’t understand how those military cultivators can kill without blinking an eye and still avoid karmic retribution."

The old man smiled, "As long as one can become a member of a sect, they naturally have their own profound principles to stand firm in this world."

Yuan Xuan scratched his head and sighed, "Our fishing floats are steadier than those door gods; each one is more reliable than the last."

The old man burst into laughter, and the woman joined in.

Meanwhile, at an inn north of Qinglu Town, Du Wensi stood at the door.

The young woman, who had grown up in the city of Copper Smell, was not unfamiliar with the Golden Core cultivator Du Wensi. Known for his gentlemanly demeanor, the woman at the inn’s entrance felt at ease and asked curiously, "Master Du, are you waiting for someone?"

Du Wensi shook his head with a smile. "It’s stuffy inside; just stepping out for some fresh air."

The woman was at a loss for words until she remembered something. The last time, Master Du had also stood at the door and appeared lost in thought.

A few years ago, a young female cultivator of high standing had acted arrogantly, not entering Ghostly Hollow Valley through the archway but rather splitting the sky with a sword. After making her grand entrance, she turned around and left, only to return twice to cleave the supposedly indestructible barrier of heaven and earth. The last time was just outside Qinglu Town, where she finally landed and stayed at this very inn, just as Master Du was receiving guests. Even the head of the Zhu Sect came to visit.

Her repeated intrusions into Ghostly Hollow Valley had drawn the attention of several heroic spirits who sought to eliminate her.

On the last occasion, she was even struck by the sect leader, but she managed to withstand it.

Moreover, the sect leader Zhu Quan only demonstrated a symbolic show of force and didn’t exert himself fully.

After some words were exchanged, Zhu Quan returned to his thatched hut, allowing the female cultivator to enter the valley, thus passing the trial of the Pima Sect.

The foreign female cultivator had only stayed at the inn for a day. When she left, she once again broke the sky with her sword, acting quite unreasonably. However, she was slightly more restrained than when she had arrived, first flying over a northern city before breaking through the barrier and leisurely departing.

Afterward, Master Du stood at the door for quite some time. When asked, he simply replied that he was just stepping out for some fresh air.

Master Du truly was a gentleman—he couldn’t even lie.

Later, he overheard some celestial guests at the inn say that the traveling female cultivator was from Tongye Continent and had fought a genius named Liu Jinglong at Tili Mountain. That genius was renowned even among the loose cultivators, and the door guard had heard of Liu Jinglong’s fame. The two had battled fiercely at Tili Mountain, both sustaining heavy injuries.

A plain-looking woman wielding a saber approached slowly from the street.

The door guard quickly held her breath and, as the woman drew near the inn, she stammered, "Sect Leader."

The saber-wielding woman smiled and nodded in greeting.

She then called out to Du Wensi, suggesting they take a walk together.

Du Wensi walked alongside Zhu Quan.

Zhu Quan teased, "Well, Huang Ting mentioned she would visit Qinglu Town again when she returns from the south, but whether she comes and when she comes is not something you can wait for at the door."

Du Wensi’s face turned slightly red.

Zhu Quan continued, "I’ve heard that the young sword immortal who caused a scene has settled in the small town?"

Du Wensi nodded. "He just returned from Copper Smell City and is staying at the inn to the south."

Zhu Quan chuckled, "This fellow is quite interesting. The first time the Deer Goddess left her painting, she was heading straight for him. I don’t know why it didn’t work out. I’m not sure who turned their nose up at whom, but in the end, that little girl ended up following the youngest sect leader in the history of North Julu Continent. This girl actually stole my thunder! If it weren’t for being in Ghostly Hollow Valley, I would definitely have wanted to spar with her. If I won, it would be known far and wide; if I lost, I would announce her name myself without needing her to spread the word."

Du Wensi chuckled in agreement. This was just the temperament of their sect leader.

Zhu Quan suddenly said, "Baojing Mountain has been completely destroyed. The ruckus caused was no small matter. However, I didn’t have the nerve to peek, so I couldn’t learn the specifics. That young man is likely, as you said, the one ranked at the bottom, Yang Renshu. It seems he has already gained the opportunities of Baojing Mountain. In any case, since he hasn’t caused trouble in Ghostly Hollow Valley, let him take his treasures and go. However, as for the territory of Bolo Mountain and Jiao Xiaoshan, it’s all because of this young man entering the small town and a mysterious scholar appearing—together, they managed to turn everything upside down. My, what a capable fellow, with aspirations even higher, manipulating all the monsters at will. Guess what happened in the end?"

Du Wensi smiled bitterly. "Sect Leader, how could I possibly guess?"

Zhu Quan sighed, "Your disposition is too dull; no wonder you’re still single. It’s not that I’m criticizing you, but if you meet that Huang Ting again and like her, just say so. If she wants to leave, you can kneel and beg. What does face matter? Once you’ve charmed her, when the time comes, you’ll know how to handle your wife, right? I don’t believe that even if you can’t subdue her in bed, you can’t in your heart… Forget it, forget it. Traditionally, men can’t defeat women in bed. Alas, thinking of it this way, it’s understandable that she wouldn't look your way. I initially wanted to play matchmaker, but now it seems it’s futile. It’s still your fault for not being up to par. Why haven’t you reached the Nascent Soul stage yet? Crawling around in the Golden Core stage, is it fun? Do you think you’re related to that old tortoise? Why don’t you go marry its daughter?"

Du Wensi’s face flushed, feeling as if he wanted to dig a hole and bury himself. He angrily retorted, "Sect Leader!"

"Alright, alright, I won’t poke at your sore spot. I’m just worried about your cultivation. You guys always say I’m a lazy sect leader, and now that I’m trying to pay attention, you look unhappy. What do you want me to do?"

Du Wensi began to rub his face.

Zhu Quan patted Du Wensi on the shoulder, "Take it easy. You should really let go of that desire. When Huang Ting returns to our Qinglu Town, don’t ask me to help you knock her out and do something underhanded like forcing her to bed. While I might be your sect leader, I’m not your parents. But Du Wensi, I think you’re much more pleasing to the eye than Yang Lin. Why not give me a try and call me 'mother'? Who knows, as your sect leader and 'mother', I might change my mind."

Even Du Wensi, with his good temperament, couldn’t help but twitch the corners of his mouth.

Zhu Quan burst into laughter, unable to contain herself for a long while. Finally, she managed to stop, mumbling that she almost split her mouth from laughing too hard. With her plain looks, how would she find a handsome young husband in the future?

Du Wensi reminded her, "Sect Leader, can we talk about serious matters?"

"Your lifelong affairs are serious matters too, aren’t they?"

Zhu Quan cleared her throat and nodded, "The old monk from Dayuan Moon Temple and the Daoist from Xiaoxuantang both left the peach grove. As for where they went, I’ll stick to my old rules and not look. But consider this: including the young sect leader of the Liuxia Boat, the Deer Goddess, and that bastard who cast nets to catch flying swords twice, along with Pu Rang’s sudden appearance and the activity of the major cities in the central part of Ghostly Hollow Valley, all these connections... Wensi, what do you think this indicates?"

Du Wensi sighed, shaking his head. "Sect Leader, you know I’m not good at these schemes and calculations."

Zhu Quan nodded heavily, seemingly pleased. She slapped Du Wensi on the back, causing him to stumble. "Very good! Just like me, you only see the commotion!"

As they reached the end of the street, Zhu Quan turned to head back to the inn first.

Du Wensi followed suit.

Zhu Quan remained silent until they reached the inn's entrance, where she finally spoke slowly, "You are at a critical moment, on the verge of breaking through the Golden Core bottleneck. So from now on, once the fighting starts, just run back to the Ancestor Hall without hesitation. Perhaps that old guy who spends all year on the ferry drinking the wind is right. Besides all the nonsense, the one thing we Pima Sect really needs is a sect leader who can use their brain. So if others die in battle, including me, it doesn’t matter. Pima Sect’s disciples should have this responsibility. But you, Du Wensi, you shouldn’t die in this foul Ghostly Hollow Valley. It’s best if you die further north."

Du Wensi shook his head. "Sect Leader, I can’t do that. Retreating in the heat of battle, I, Du Wensi, would rather forsake my path and my life than..."

Zhu Quan suddenly gently pushed Du Wensi’s head, her expression calm, her tone indifferent. "Don’t be foolish, Du Wensi. I’ll put on a sect leader’s pretense and say something heartfelt to you. In this world, at least in my eyes, a true man stands tall and firm. He can endure great hardships and endure great humiliation. No matter how the mountains press down on him, his spine remains straight!"

Du Wensi stood in place.

Zhu Quan continued to walk forward slowly.

On the towering walls of Jingguan City, a middle-aged man, handsome and poised, strolled leisurely.

In the distance, two women and a skeleton stood on the ramparts, gazing southward together.

The Daoist sect leader He Xiaoliang, the Deer Goddess, and the lord of this city, Gao Cheng, the strongest malevolent spirit in the history of the Skeleton Marsh and Ghostly Hollow Valley, sat atop this small world, almost comparable to a skilled immortal cultivator in combat.

However, Gao Cheng’s background from his living days was not recorded at all in later historical texts.

It wasn’t that historians and cultivators on the mountain didn’t want to trace origins; it was that they really couldn’t find any records in the files of the numerous vassal states of the two major dynasties. Not a single word could be found, except for a name—Gao Cheng—mentioned in a census record at the lowest level of a country’s military department.

Foot soldier Gao Cheng.

It seemed that this ghostly figure, who had risen from among the countless bones of the Skeleton Marsh years ago, was indeed a nameless soldier among the dead.

It seemed that only after he stood up as a skeletal ghost did he begin to rise step by step.

Gao Cheng was not tall and was still presented as a figure of white, slender bones, clad in the most rudimentary and tattered iron armor, with a common sword hanging at his waist.

He asked, "He Xiaoliang, now that you’ve arrived in my Jingguan City, have you finished just looking around?"

The young female cultivator, dressed in a Daoist robe and wearing a lotus crown, smiled. "Are you trying to drive me away, City Lord?"

Gao Cheng replied, "I’ll give you three more days. If you don’t leave by then, it won’t just be a matter of driving you away; it will be killing."

The Deer Goddess beside them felt a chill down her spine. The murderous aura within Jingguan City was too heavy, and the five-colored deer was a spiritual creature of heaven and earth, unable to endure such wear. It had already been put away.

This goddess had no doubt that the city lord’s words were not mere threats.

He Xiaoliang smiled. "Three days it is. When the time comes, I’ll definitely leave Jingguan City."

Gao Cheng glanced at the distant figure walking on the wall, "That Jiang Shangzhen better not take your Liuxia Boat to leave. Otherwise, I might not be able to resist drawing my sword."

He Xiaoliang remained noncommittal.

Gao Cheng descended from the city wall.

Jiang Shangzhen returned to where He Xiaoliang and the Deer Goddess were, jumping down from the ramparts with a smile. "As long as Sect Leader He doesn’t say anything or do anything, just looking around, if you don’t take me with you when you leave, that’s fine. At worst, I’ll stay in Jingguan City and enjoy the company of those bone beauties; it’s a unique experience."

He Xiaoliang silently asked, "What do you think Ghostly Hollow Valley lacks the most?"

Jiang Shangzhen leaned against the wall, rubbing his backside, and lazily replied, "Naturally living people. In fact, the spiritual energy of this small world hasn’t changed much and can’t produce any novelty. After all these years of fighting and dying, it’s merely letting Gao Cheng take shelter among the likes of Pu Rang. However, there are too few living people with yang energy. The Fengshui of Copper Smell City is tightly monitored by Qinglu Town and Zhu Quan. It’s clear that if Gao Cheng dares to snatch someone, she will tear her face and start a fight."

He Xiaoliang smiled. "Then what if Gao Cheng could create a cycle? Allowing all those scattered souls and residual yin energy, which even the heavenly beings and gods in Ghostly Hollow Valley couldn’t gather, to reincarnate in Ghostly Hollow Valley? After a hundred years, with the balance of yin and yang, Ghostly Hollow Valley would ascend two levels, becoming a realm of both caves and blessed lands. What would happen then?"

Jiang Shangzhen’s expression grew serious at first, but he quickly shook his head. "Gao Cheng’s cultivation is high; I can’t defeat him even in Ghostly Hollow Valley. I can reluctantly admit that. Strong dragons don’t suppress local snakes. But to say that Gao Cheng has obtained an ancient forbidden secret technique, knowing about the reincarnation method but unable to master it, I, Jiang Shangzhen... could also reluctantly accept. However, if you claim this city lord has the supreme artifact in hand, capable of bearing this great karma of heaven and earth, to create a place akin to Fengdu right here in Ghostly Hollow Valley, I absolutely don’t believe it!"

He Xiaoliang smiled. "Then let’s wait and see."

Jiang Shangzhen’s expression darkened.

For the first time, he felt a heavy mood.

He Xiaoliang suddenly laughed. "Jiang Shangzhen, you’ve actually misjudged one thing."

Jiang Shangzhen returned to his smiling self and said, "Sect Leader He, please speak."

However, He Xiaoliang did not continue.

Her expression was complex.

Jiang Shangzhen began to silently deduce in his heart.

Unfortunately, there were still two obstacles he couldn’t break through, which was quite troublesome.

In this world, a slight difference can lead to a vast divergence.

Because the Daoist from Xiaoxuantang and the old monk from Dayuan Moon Temple had previously left the peach grove, each having used methods to conceal the heavenly secrets.

One appeared at the southern cliff with the iron chain bridge, standing there for an entire night.

The other appeared near the water god temple, at the bank where the river was buried. Comparatively, the old monk was rather quick in coming and going.

As for Chen Ping arriving in Qinglu Town, he could no longer watch. Jiang Shangzhen was the same, and He Xiaoliang likely was too, but as for Gao Cheng, it was hard to tell.

At the inn in Qinglu Town, even though Chen Ping had been in a restless state for quite some time, he forced himself to calm down and tried to draw two golden shrinking talismans overnight.

However, after picking up his brush, he found himself unable to start. He was well aware that if he forced it, he wouldn’t be able to draw talismans on the golden talisman paper. Perhaps it would work on ordinary talisman paper.

Chen Ping set down his brush, stood up, and practiced the sword furnace stance for an hour, yet still couldn’t find true calm.

Instead, he decided to open the door and take a stroll around Qinglu Town at night. After returning to his room, he took out some bamboo slips and pored over them for a long time.

He ended up keeping the lamp burning all night.

When morning came, Chen Ping covered his face, slinging his bag over his back, and went to Copper Smell City. He felt a bit regretful for not encountering the familiar gate officer ghost.

When he arrived at the Golden Powder Workshop, it had just opened. The female ghost shopkeeper was taken aback for a moment and instructed a boy ghost to ring a silver bell to summon the "workshop owner." The clever little ghost nodded and, without a word, went to the northern gate to find the door god general. Soon, Tang Jinxiu brought it back to the Golden Powder Workshop and entered the shop, where Tang Jinxiu saw that the counter was already filled with items.

Tang Jinxiu smiled and said, "Old immortal, back again, huh? Is our Ghostly Hollow Valley filled with treasures? Did you just pick up a sack full overnight?"

Chen Ping laughed. "Indeed, it’s a great place."

Tang Jinxiu was momentarily speechless. They began their usual buying and selling.

However, this time, after looking through the items in the package, Tang Jinxiu only bought two, pulling out two small summer coins.

It wasn’t that she was stingy with celestial money; it was just the way things were. If it weren’t for the fact that the other party was a "young sword immortal," paying a small summer coin would already be considered fair trade.

After receiving the money, Chen Ping left Copper Smell City.

He didn’t feel like he had wasted a trip.

Two small summer coins were not a small amount.

Upon returning to Qinglu Town, Chen Ping continued to practice the Heaven and Earth Stance in his room.

He planned to walk the stance beyond that and practice this strange boxing stance a million times.

That day, he only had one meal. In the evening, he went to the tavern and bought a jug of wine. With few patrons around, Chen Ping finished his drink and just as he finished a dish of snacks.

Once again, he spent the night trying to draw talismans but to no avail. However, compared to the previous day, it was much better. In the latter half of the night, he didn’t practice the Heaven and Earth Stance but lay on his bed, resting his eyes and reminiscing about many old memories. As he thought and thought, the memories of his youth, particularly the times he went up the mountain to gather herbs, filled his mind. Unknowingly, he drifted into a deep sleep.

After waking up the next morning, Chen Ping suddenly felt refreshed. He packed a new bag and headed back to Copper Smell City, where he finally encountered the ghost officer at the city gate. Chen Ping was more anxious than the ghost officer, tossing out a snowflake coin. Under the guidance of the ghost general, he once again heard the familiar auspicious phrase, "May wealth flow in."

Chen Ping headed straight for the Golden Powder Workshop, where this time Tang Jinxiu was already waiting at the shop door.

Upon seeing Chen Ping, she smiled and said, "Old immortal, you give me a straight answer: are you coming tomorrow? If you are, I’ll just lay down a mat in the shop today!"

Chen Ping laughed heartily. "After today, there really won’t be any treasures to sell for a while. It’s my fault; yesterday I drank and fell straight asleep, which caused me to miss my opportunity to go out and collect things. Drinking too much really does lead to trouble."

Today, after Tang Jinxiu reviewed all the items, she picked out six, giving five small summer coins.

Although it couldn’t compare to the first day, it was a far cry from the previous day’s awkward standoff, where one side asked if they truly wouldn’t buy, and the other repeatedly answered they couldn’t bear to part with their items. Today’s transaction was much more joyful.

After Chen Ping received the small summer coins and packed his items, Tang Jinxiu accompanied him to the door, joking, "Old immortal, are you really not coming tomorrow?"

Chen Ping adjusted his hat, turned around, and smiled. "Tomorrow, the prime minister’s lady will sleep in, so don’t worry."

Tang Jinxiu was slightly taken aback and then smiled. "Okay."

Chen Ping thought for a moment, then turned back and cupped his fists in farewell. "Thank you for your hospitality."

Tang Jinxiu also performed a polite gesture, her smile bright. "Sword immortal, take care, and come back when you have time."

Chen Ping nodded.

Suddenly, Tang Jinxiu couldn’t help but chuckle, saying, "This sword immortal shouldn’t go rummaging through women’s boudoirs in the future, or it would be quite embarrassing."

Chen Ping didn’t turn his head, hastily leaving.

Tang Jinxiu held her belly with one hand and covered her mouth with the other. She ultimately didn’t dare to laugh out loud, fearing that the young sword immortal, who had a thick yet thin skin, would turn around and shoot a flying sword at her.

As Chen Ping left the city gates, he didn’t forget to give the ghost officer at the city gate another snowflake coin. After walking a few steps outside the city gate, he inexplicably stopped, turned back, murmured to himself, and without hesitation, tossed out another celestial coin—not a snowflake coin, but a small summer coin. Chen Ping smiled brightly and said, "The general can treat his brothers to the best wine in the city."

The ghost officer, as if dreaming, repeatedly inspected the small summer coin in hand, then burst into hearty laughter, saying, "This is great! In our Copper Smell City, this thing is truly the ancestor of celestial money, worth more than anything!"

When Chen Ping returned to Qinglu Town, having nothing to do, he began practicing the six-step stance. After all, the Heaven and Earth Stance was still too strange.

The more he practiced, the calmer he felt.

Unbeknownst to him, he arrived back in Qinglu Town. After a smile, he continued practicing the six-step stance on his way to the inn, as there weren’t many steps left.

Upon reaching the inn, he stored the entire package into his spatial item.

This burden had served well enough in Ghostly Hollow Valley.

Thinking back to the last small summer coin he had given, Chen Ping took a deep breath.

Sitting at the table, Chen Ping took another deep breath, seemingly due to his newfound determination. Without any distractions, he once again retrieved his writing materials and two sheets of golden talisman paper to draw the shrinking talisman.

He completed it in one go.

After resting briefly, he shook his wrist, stood up, and continued practicing the six-step stance in the room. After sitting down again, he took a deep breath and successfully drew the second shrinking talisman.

Once he had completed both shrinking talismans, he carefully stored them in his sleeve.

Chen Ping closed his eyes and began to quickly reflect on all his experiences entering Ghostly Hollow Valley.

From walking with Yuan Xuan from San Lang Temple, the couple of Daoists, passing through the archway, Crows Ridge, Baojing Mountain, the Peach Grove, and Bolo Mountain… ultimately landing at the banks of the Black River.

The old monk once said, "Turning back is the shore."

Earlier, when he was at the city gate, Chen Ping had thought of these four words, which had prompted him to give out that small summer coin.

After opening his eyes, Chen Ping squinted and, after a moment, retrieved some new items from his spatial item, such as the few illustrations of gods fighting from the Deer Goddess's boudoir and those five golden bamboo whips!

After leaving the inn, Chen Ping didn’t head straight for Copper Smell City but instead went to the local tavern and ordered a bowl of wine.

When the old tavern keeper set the wine bowl on the table, he couldn’t help but chuckle, "Little sword immortal, what’s this? You just finished your business in Copper Smell City and now want to earn some more?"

Chen Ping smiled. "Celestial money doesn’t grow legs; what’s in other people’s pockets won’t move itself. I can only rely on myself to run a few more steps."

The old tavern keeper had served this young sword immortal a bowl of wine before, so he recognized the youthful face and teased, "Have you seen the city lord’s sister, Tang Jinxiu? If you want to earn more money from her, I suggest you don’t try to act like an old man."

Chen Ping took a sip of wine and joked, "Forget it. If I catch her eye, that would be a troublesome matter."

The old tavern keeper laughed heartily. "Fair enough."

Watching Chen Ping sit there sipping his wine, the old keeper asked, "This esteemed sword immortal, how many times have you gone to Copper Smell City as that wild cultivator’s burden? Aren’t you afraid of getting a whiff of that copper smell?"

Chen Ping laughed. "This time should earn a bit more. The previous few times were just to warm up, to whet her appetite a bit."

After finishing his drink, Chen Ping headed towards Copper Smell City, only to find that the ghost officer at the city gate was no longer there.

Chen Ping looked quite disappointed. He asked a city gate ghost soldier where the general had gone, and the ghost soldier complained, "Old immortal, it’s all because you gave that snowflake coin that our general went off to enjoy himself at the daughter’s workshop. We, the lackeys, didn’t even get to drink a single bowl of wine."

Chen Ping had a blank expression and sighed, turning to leave. Then he turned back and tossed out another snowflake coin to the ghost soldier, instructing, "Make sure to tell your general that I’ll come back to Copper Smell City tomorrow. He must be here."

The ghost soldier, overjoyed after receiving the coin, nodded and bowed repeatedly, shouting, "Old immortal, do not worry, tomorrow I’ll even bind the general and bring him to you!"

After returning to the inn in Qinglu Town, Chen Ping continued to stay in seclusion.  
*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 579: I Can Open the Sky with a Sword (Part 4)

In the northern part of Ghostly Trap Valley, at the towering Bone Throne of Jingguan City, the lord Gao Cheng chuckled to himself as he withdrew his hand. The young man had returned to Qinglu Town, disappointed at not catching a glimpse of the auspicious ghost at the city gate. 

At this moment, Gao Cheng was no longer the bony figure of before but had reverted to his appearance in life, albeit still rather plain-looking. 

“Going to Copper Stench City tomorrow?” 

Gao Cheng recalled the sword-raising gourd that the young man had hung at his waist. 

He gently pressed down on the hilt of his sword, beginning to wait for the departure of the female sect leader. 

From his vantage point, Gao Cheng could see some scenes within Qinglu Town—specifically two locations. However, every time he spied, he had to proceed with utmost caution. For one, strictly speaking, Qinglu Town did not belong to the small world of Ghostly Trap Valley. Furthermore, with Zhu Quan watching from that side and the Pima Sect's precious treasure suppressing the area, his divine sense was sluggish and unclear, allowing him only a rough idea of what was happening.

But even if those two pieces on the board revealed their whereabouts, it was still worthwhile. 

Gao Cheng actually hoped that the young man would venture out of Qinglu Town and walk a few more steps to the north. 

It seemed that fellow would indeed continue his journey northward. 

Now, it was only a matter of waiting for the little Daoist nun named He to leave Ghostly Trap Valley. 

She was still in Jingguan City. 

Along with the notorious Jiang Shangzhen, the situation was becoming exceedingly complex. 

Gao Cheng closed his eyes, his hands lightly resting on the arms of the throne, which were shaped like the heads of fallen emperors. 

As night fell, the Flowing Mist Boat slowly ascended into the sky. 

Gao Cheng stood, instantly appearing atop the treasure boat. 

He Xiaoliang gazed at the lord of Jingguan City with a smile that was neither here nor there. 

Suddenly, Gao Cheng realized an obscure truth and burst into laughter, pounding his chest as he spoke in a deep voice, “Though I do not know why you wish to do this, all the twists and turns do not concern me. As long as it succeeds, Jingguan City will surely reward you greatly in the future!” 

He Xiaoliang ignored him. 

She continued to do nothing and say nothing. 

Gao Cheng no longer delayed the departure of the treasure boat from Ghostly Trap Valley. He swiftly returned to the Bone Throne of Jingguan City and waved his hand, actively opening a great door between Ghostly Trap Valley and the Bone Marsh in the direction the Flowing Mist Boat was headed. 

On the city wall, Jiang Shangzhen indeed did not board the Flowing Mist Boat but continued to stroll along the wall, gazing up at the sky, where a hole resembling a door appeared. 

The Flowing Mist Boat flickered and vanished. 

After returning to the Bone Marsh, the door behind him closed instantly. 

The Deer-Riding Goddess cautiously asked, “Master, what is the meaning of this?” 

He Xiaoliang replied indifferently, “In this world, relations between Dao partners are often intertwined with fortune and misfortune. As for me, He Xiaoliang, I am renowned for having a deep affinity for blessings across two continents. Therefore, wherever I go, if I have a Dao partner, he will naturally receive endless fortune. The closer we are, the more so. But within Jingguan City, where my life force clashes and my Dao refinement wanes, it is certainly not a good thing.” 

The Deer-Riding Goddess became somewhat tongue-tied, “So that's why I stepped out of the painting? So that’s why you deliberately came to this Ghostly Trap Valley, then left tonight?” 

He Xiaoliang remained silent. 

The Deer-Riding Goddess's complexion turned pale. 

In the sky above the Bone Marsh, He Xiaoliang suddenly turned her head, slightly parting her lips. She wore an expression that was hard to read—whether joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness—but ultimately regained her composure and deeply gazed toward the south. 

The Deer-Riding Goddess trembled. 

He Xiaoliang turned her head and simply said one word: “Go.” 

Within Jingguan City, after Jiang Shangzhen caught sight of the utterly unbelievable scene, he wiped his face vigorously. 

"This time, I’m really impressed!" 

How could someone even think of this, let alone achieve it? 

Gao Cheng suddenly stood up, his anger surging, and shouted, “Leave the flying sword!” 

Within the Great Round Moon Temple, the old monk looked up at the moon, clasped his hands together, and smiled: “Good.” 

Over at Qinglu Town. 

From the southern inn's rooftop, after two flashes of golden light, a young swordsman donned in a golden robe instantaneously arrived not far from the sky, wielding the Sword Immortal, and cleaved open the sky, directing his sword straight towards the Pima Sect's ancestor hall. 

Zhu Quan pressed down on the hilt of his sword, hovering in mid-air, gazing northward. 

This Pima Sect leader not only did not stop the young Sword Immortal, but instead helped keep watch over the northern developments for the young Sword Immortal who had discreetly visited her earlier and made a significant deal together. 

Within Jingguan City, a towering Bone Swordsman over a thousand feet tall suddenly appeared, intending to cleave through the world’s barrier and pursue the young Sword Immortal. 

Jiang Shangzhen let out a hearty laugh, tossing out a net larger than the previous two “Snowflake Money Nets.” Those two were merely nets for descendants; this one was a net for ancestors. 

The great net swiftly ensnared the Bone Swordsman’s ankle, yanking it down violently. Jiang Shangzhen leaped up, wielding a willow leaf to break open the heavens, completely giving up that heavy treasure net worth dozens of Valley Rain Coins. As he flew out of the sky's hole, he turned back and laughed, “Come and fight me, you bony frame! Come on! If you don’t, you’ll be my dear grandson!” 

Jiang Shangzhen spoke harshly but wasted no time in escaping. 

Within Ghostly Trap Valley, Zhu Quan drew his sword, and a white rainbow soared from south to north, striking the massive bone figure's waist. 

Another sword shot like a rainbow, originating from White Cage City, slicing into the Bone Swordsman’s head. 

Zhu Quan raised an eyebrow and asked, “Pu's head, what are you doing? Have you long coveted my beauty, hence your wife singing and your husband following?” 

The white-boned figure in green replied calmly, “We sword practitioners act freely, unrestricted by heaven and earth.” 

Zhu Quan and Pu Rang each drew their weapons, blocking the towering bone figure from tearing through the sky's barrier. 

Outside the Bone Marsh. 

Chen Ping'an soared on his sword towards the Pima Sect's mountain's ancestor hall, wiping the sweat from his forehead, and grinned. 

“I too have opened the sky with a sword.” 

What a thrill. 

The Pima Sect’s ancestral mountain, named Muyi, towered high but lacked luxurious buildings, as the practitioners merely made thatched huts. Due to the scarce number of Pima Sect practitioners, it appeared even more desolate, save for a residence hanging a plaque inscribed with “Law Image” in the middle of the mountain, which barely counted as a place for celestial visitors. 

Three days earlier, Muyi Mountain had begun sealing itself off, no longer receiving guests. 

Moreover, the archway at the entrance of Ghostly Trap Valley was also under strict guard; those with experience could exit but not enter. 

From Naheguan Market to Mural City, then to the Shimmering River area and the entire Bone Marsh, no one found this unreasonable. 

Because they had already witnessed even more unreasonable occurrences. 

First, the three murals of the Heavenly Officials in Mural City had turned into simple outlines on the same day. 

Compared to the subsequent great upheaval, this was not worth mentioning. The many cultivators of the Bone Marsh were still immersed in the disappointment of three fortunes already having an owner. Not long after, they all witnessed a shocking scene—the appearance of a gigantic bone figure, towering like a mountain, emerging from thin air above the Bone Marsh at midnight. This unmatchable figure should have been the law image of Gao Cheng, the lord of Jingguan City in Ghostly Trap Valley, which opened the world’s barrier with brute force. 

When the bone law image manifested, it clashed with the earthly realm, creating a dazzling display as the bone and the spiritual energy of the Bone Marsh rubbed against each other, sparking spectacular fireworks that made the bone law image seem like an ancient fire deity descending upon the world. 

The bone figure was evidently pursuing a golden light that rushed southward toward the ancestor hall of Muyi Mountain. Although Gao Cheng was delayed by the sword and blade originating from Ghostly Trap Valley, the sword cultivator hovering in mid-air was as small as a grain of rice, yet each strike resonated with thunder and light, akin to a vast bridge. Judging by the aura, it was undoubtedly Zhu Quan of the Pima Sect. Yet another sword, equally formidable as Zhu Quan of the Jade Purity realm, erupted with dazzling sword energy from the earth, swift and straight as a rainbow. 

The white-boned law image, slightly tilted, seemed to be tangled with something else within Ghostly Trap Valley, but it still raised one hand heavily, causing a thick cloud of ominous energy to surge up, howling like hungry ghosts, as if it had piled up hundreds of thousands of spirits in the afterlife, struggling in the sea of suffering. 

The cloud rapidly pressed toward the ancestor hall of the Pima Sect, after which the Pima Sect’s mountain protection formation activated, sending out over a thousand armored puppets from Muyi Mountain—each towering several feet tall, adorned in talismans and iron armor, shimmering with golden and silver threads, charging into the cloud. 

The cloud was continuously thinned, yet its downward momentum remained. Within Muyi Mountain, waves of armored spirits surged forth, ultimately resulting in a mutual slaughter between the cloud and the thousands of puppets crafted by the Pima Sect, leading to both sides suffering catastrophic losses. 

At the same time, a beam of light spread down from the ancestor hall of Muyi Mountain like lightning, intertwining into a radiant formation near the archway, before a golden-bodied deity, standing five hundred feet tall, rose from within, wielding a massive sword, and swept it toward the waist of the bone law image. 

Gao Cheng's bone law image failed to strike, and at the junction of Ghostly Trap Valley and the Bone Marsh, a golden-bodied deity suddenly struck with a sword, the gigantic bone figure grasping the sword edge. Sparks of golden light rained down on the earth, shaking the entire Bone Marsh. 

The bone law image swung its arm to fling away the massive sword, its form descending and instantly merging into the earth’s shadow, retreating back into the small world of Ghostly Trap Valley. 

The golden-bodied deity also retreated back into the formation, the beam of light retracing its path to the ancestor hall of Muyi Mountain, condensing into a precious pearl held in the mouth of a bronze dragon statue within the shrine. 

The night over the Bone Marsh gradually returned to silence. 

At the half-mountain residence of the celestial family. 

The young man Pang Lanxi, who was greatly valued by the Pima Sect, sat at a stone table, staring intently at the young wanderer across from him, who was leafing through a yellowed military manual acquired from the Sheep Intestine Palace. 

Although Pang Lanxi was young, he held a high status as the only direct descendant of an elder in the Pima Sect, with several Golden Core practitioners addressing him as “Little Shishu.” As for more mid-level practitioners, they could only call him “Little Shizuzu.” Over the past three days, the only guest in the residence was this swordsman in green. Pang Lanxi had visited several times before, out of curiosity, and they had chatted about many topics, but after some reflection, it seemed they hadn’t really hit the nail on the head. 

It was hard to imagine that the person before him was the same man who had brazenly bargained with him in Mural City. 

Back then, his childhood sweetheart had even run out of the shop to remind this person not to flaunt his wealth while wandering the world. It turned out they had all been deceived by this fellow. 

The elder in charge of the sect’s regulations in the ancestor hall was unwilling to reveal heavenly secrets, merely stating that they would discuss it once the sect leader returned to Muyi Mountain. However, he did express a sentiment that escaping from Gao Cheng in Ghostly Trap Valley at this level of cultivation was truly impressive. 

Pang Lanxi grew even more curious about what had transpired in Ghostly Trap Valley, wondering how this person had attracted the attention of the lord of Jingguan City. 

Chen Ping'an put down the military manual written by a general from the Divine Strategy Kingdom and recalled something, smiling as he asked, “Lanxi, what do you plan to do now that the murals of the eight Heavenly Official Goddesses in Mural City have turned into simple outlines?” 

Pang Lanxi also felt a bit troubled, replying helplessly, “What can I do? Xingzi is almost dead from worry, saying there will definitely be no business in the future. Now that the three fortunes in Mural City are gone, the number of customers will surely plummet. What can I do but comfort her? I told her some grand truths I heard from my senior brothers, but unexpectedly, Xingzi not only didn’t appreciate it but also got mad at me, refusing to speak to me.” 

“Chen Ping'an, why is Xingzi like this? I clearly meant well, so why is she upset?” 

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Do you want to know why?” 

Pang Lanxi nodded, “Of course.” 

Chen Ping'an’s smile widened, “Lanxi, I heard your great-grandfather still has a few complete sets of the Goddess murals, which are his most time-consuming and proud works.” 

Pang Lanxi froze for a moment, then decisively said, “If you can help me understand, I will go steal a painting right now!” 

Chen Ping'an felt somewhat speechless and gestured for Pang Lanxi, who had already stood up, to sit down again, “A gentleman does not take what others cherish. I do not covet those sets. I just hope you can persuade your great-grandfather to paint one or two new sets that are not too inferior to the originals. I’m willing to pay for it, not asking you to steal. One set is sufficient; two sets would be better; three sets would be ideal.” 

Pang Lanxi hesitated, “Is it really just that?” 

Chen Ping'an nodded. 

Pang Lanxi was still a bit doubtful, “Stealing has its pros and cons. The downside is I would definitely get scolded, and I might even get beaten up. The upside is it’s a one-time deal, straightforward. But it’s not easy to wear down my great-grandfather’s stubbornness and make him actually draw with care. He has a strange temper; all of us in the Pima Sect have experienced that. He always says the more effort and heart put into the painting, the more lifelike it becomes, so buying it for mundane men would be an offense to the eight goddesses.” 

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Sincerity brings spirit. Without this foundation of earnestness, your great-grandfather might not be able to capture that spirit. Otherwise, if a master painter were simply to replicate a scroll down to the tiniest detail, it would be no difficulty. But why is it that only your great-grandfather has such skill? Because of his pure heart, it’s said the eight goddesses must have seen this back in the day, their hearts resonating, thus giving rise to his miraculous brushwork.” 

Pang Lanxi blinked. 

Was this sincere talk or flattery? 

Outside the residence, a tall old man with white hair and a brush and inkstone at his waist turned to a close friend, an elder of the Pima Sect, who was just putting his hand down. 

The white-haired elder asked, “Does this boy’s cultivation level suggest he is unaware we are eavesdropping?” 

The elder smiled, “I concealed my aura, so he shouldn’t know. However, in this world, there are countless arts and techniques, and it’s possible there could be unforeseen circumstances. The fact he could escape from Ghostly Trap Valley is beyond ordinary expectation.” 

The white-haired elder stroked his beard and laughed, “Regardless, this boy’s words resonate deeply with me.” 

The elder of the Pima Sect was the one who had previously followed Jiang Shangzhen into the mural secret realm. “Are you truly willing to sell?” 

This Pang Lanxi's great-grandfather, Pang Shanling, had once vowed in his youth to paint the splendid mountains of the world, but later, for reasons unknown, had settled down with the Pima Sect. Pang Shanling quietly asked, “Shall we continue to listen? I want to hear how this outsider will guide Lanxi.” 

The elder frowned, displeased, “He is a guest. I was unable to refuse you before, so I used a bit of divine power. Eavesdropping further does not align with our Pima Sect’s hospitality.” 

Pang Shanling glared, “Lanxi has already lost the fortune of the Deer-Riding Goddess. If there are further complications in his emotional affairs, I want to see if Lanxi's master would scold you thoroughly!” 

The elder scoffed, “He is skilled at cursing, but I am more skilled at strikes. He only feels good when he curses, yet he lies in bed for a month after each time.” 

Pang Shanling suddenly laughed, “I’ll send you a set of the hard yellow versions of the Goddess murals later, worthy of the praise ‘miraculous brushwork.’” 

The elder raised his hand to observe the surroundings, smiling, “I was waiting for this sentence from you. You’re so slow; it’s unsatisfying.” 

However, this elder quickly withdrew his divine sense, and Pang Shanling wondered, “Why?” 

The elder laughed, “The other party is somewhat displeased. Let’s take our leave while we’re ahead. Otherwise, we might end up in trouble if the sect leader hears about us. There has been such a commotion in Ghostly Trap Valley; it took great effort for Gao Cheng to reveal his law image and leave his lair, appearing in the Bone Marsh. Not only did the sect leader act personally, but we also activated the mountain protection formation, and it took a hundred years of his cultivation to suppress him. When the sect leader returns to the mountain, he will undoubtedly be in a terrible mood.” 

Pang Shanling expressed concern, “In these past two days, Ghostly Trap Valley has completely cut off from the outside world. Although the life lamps in the ancestor hall are still lit, that means the guarding cultivators in Qinglu and Lanxia Town have suffered no casualties. But who knows if Gao Cheng, in a fit of rage, will choose to fight the Pima Sect to the death? The situation that has stood for a thousand years between the Bone Marsh and Ghostly Trap Valley might be shattered in an instant. I fear that at some point, the life lamps in the ancestor hall will begin to extinguish one after another at a horrifying speed.” 

At that time, who could guarantee how many would remain? Neither the sect leader Zhu Quan nor the Golden Core Du Wensi, nor anyone else, could be exempt. If a great battle were to break out, with the Pima Sect’s style, it would not be surprising if their life lamps extinguished first. 

The elder guessed Pang Shanling’s thoughts and comforted him with a smile, “This time, Gao Cheng’s vitality has been severely injured, and he will undoubtedly be extremely furious. This is only natural. However, there are still some good pieces of news from within Ghostly Trap Valley. The one who struck earlier was Pu Rang from White Cage City, and the golden elixir spirit born from a general of the Divine Strategy Kingdom has always been at odds with Jingguan City. When the sky opened, I noticed it seemed to want to intervene as well. Let us not forget, Ghostly Trap Valley also has that peach forest, and the two reclusive experts from the temple and the观 will not allow Gao Cheng to rampage freely.” 

Pang Shanling nodded slightly, “Let’s hope so.” 

Back at the residence. 

Pang Lanxi set aside everything else, as his childhood sweetheart Xingzi was the most important. He said, “Alright, you say it, but it must be something I find reasonable. Otherwise, I won’t go to my great-grandfather to get scolded.” 

Chen Ping'an first raised both hands in a fist, signaling the celestial experts outside not to overstep, then gently placed one hand on the military manual, stroking over it. After leaving Ghostly Trap Valley, he discovered that most of the books collected by the demon-hunting immortal from Sheep Intestine Palace were well-preserved, with decent condition. These were all rare editions, some even unique, that had survived for a millennium, which put him in a good mood. He began to enlighten the young man before him, softly smiling, “Lanxi, do you think it’s difficult to attain the Golden Core realm and become a land deity in the eyes of an ordinary scholar?” 

Pang Lanxi earnestly replied, “Chen Ping'an, I’m not boasting; the Golden Core is easy, and the Nascent Soul is not difficult.” 

Chen Ping'an nodded. 

What Pang Lanxi said was indeed true. In these past few days spent in the residence of the Pima Sect, through casual chats with this young man and exchanges with several direct descendants of the Pima Sect, including the Golden Core practitioner Yang Lin, he had a rough idea of Pang Lanxi’s standing within the Pima Sect. It was highly likely he was being nurtured as a future leader, at the very least someone with considerable authority in the Pima Sect. 

Moreover, Pang Lanxi was exceptionally gifted, pure of heart, and kind to others; whether innate roots or acquired temperament, he was extraordinarily compatible with the Pima Sect. This is the wonder of the Dao—Pang Lanxi, had he been born in Shujian Lake, could have had a much lower attainment in the Dao. That’s because the environment of Shujian Lake would wear down Pang Lanxi’s original nature, adversely affecting his cultivation and opportunities. But here, on Muyi Mountain, it was like a fish in water, as if it were a match made in heaven. This is probably what is meant by “a place’s water and soil nurtures its people.” Those who blame heaven and fate may not entirely lack self-awareness; indeed, they may have simply encountered some misfortune. 

Seeing Chen Ping'an lost in thought, Pang Lanxi couldn’t help but remind him, “Chen Ping'an, don’t get distracted; one or two sets of murals are beckoning to you!” 

Chen Ping'an apologized and then asked, “You are destined to be a long-lived mountain deity, yet your sweetheart Xingzi is a mortal from the marketplace. Have you thought about this? For an ordinary woman, by forty, she’ll have some white hair, and by sixty, she might already be a white-haired old woman. At that time, how will you face Xingzi, who might still look youthful or at most be just a young adult?” 

Pang Lanxi’s heart tightened, and he murmured, “I could deliberately align with the times and not let my appearance remain the same, becoming an old man with white hair just like her.” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “You’re wrong, very wrong.” 

Pang Lanxi looked up, confused. 

Chen Ping'an continued, “Let’s not even mention that your old appearance will still radiate spirit and brilliance. Just consider this—have you put yourself in the shoes of your beloved Xingzi and thought this through? Some things, no matter how well you think they should be, are not inherently good just because you think so. Have you considered that offering true goodwill is never a matter of ‘I’ or ‘we’ wishing for it?” 

Pang Lanxi hesitated, speechless. 

Chen Ping'an slowly said, “In Mural City, I was merely a passerby who crossed paths with you two. Since she would run out of the shop to remind you to be cautious, this kindness certainly indicates she is a good girl worthy of your affection. I observed you both in the shop as an onlooker and could tell that Xingzi is someone with a delicate heart yet broad-minded. Such a rarity! She would not feel inferior just because you are now a divine being dining on the clouds in the Pima Sect; she is merely a merchant dealing with money at the foot of the mountain and would feel ashamed in your presence, but she didn’t. 

Do you truly understand how rare and precious this mindset is?” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “You don’t know.” 

Pang Lanxi sat in silence, lips moving slightly. 

Chen Ping'an said, “So all these years, she has been nurturing your heart, hoping you can cultivate in peace and ascend steadily in the mountain. If I’m not wrong, every time you rarely descend the mountain to help in the shop, she definitely will not express too much reluctance when parting. Afterward, you must feel somewhat depressed, worried that she doesn’t like you as much as you like her, right?” 

Pang Lanxi felt his eyes sting, tightly pursing his lips. 

Chen Ping'an sighed gently, taking out a flask of wine—not some celestial brew, but the kind of homemade rice wine from Longquan County that is sold in the capital of Dali. Chen Ping'an took a sip, “You have never truly considered her feelings, yet you only think about what you should do. Is this alright?” 

Pang Lanxi shook his head, “Not alright, very not alright.” 

“So, when the fortunes of the goddess murals in Mural City are lost, and the shop might not be able to continue, you only see it as a trivial matter because for you, Pang Lanxi, it is indeed a small matter. A shop at the foot of the mountain, can its profits and losses amount to just a few coins? How many coins do you think I, Pang Lanxi, earn from the Pima Sect’s ancestor hall in a year?” 

“But you don’t fully realize how significant that shop at the foot of the Pima Sect is for a marketplace girl. Losing that source of livelihood, even if it merely means moving to a market like Naheguan, is that not a world-shattering event for her?” 

Chen Ping'an took another sip of wine, his voice soft and rich, the content of his words flowing like the wine, “The thoughts of a young girl are often longer-term than those of boys her age. How to say this—the difference between the two is like a boy standing on a mountain, only looking up, while a girl’s thoughts are like a winding little river, meandering toward the distance.” 

Pang Lanxi furrowed his brow tightly, as if recalling some sorrowful memory. Just thinking about it made this originally carefree young man feel a pang in his heart. Tears were already welling up in his eyes. 

Chen Ping'an glanced at him and gently sighed. 

Even the seemingly heartless Liu Lao Cheng from Gongliu Island had once stumbled terribly over matters of the heart. 

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an laughed, “What are you afraid of? Now that you know a bit more, you can do better for her in the future. If it’s really difficult and you feel you aren’t good at understanding a girl’s thoughts, I’ll teach you the simplest method: speak your heart to her. There’s no need to feel embarrassed. A man’s pride should be maintained with others, but there’s no need to uphold it in front of the girl you admire.” 

Pang Lanxi nodded, wiping his face and smiling brightly, “Chen Ping'an, how do you know so much?” 

After all, as a cultivator, once the veil was lifted, it was as if a leaf blocking his eyes had been removed, allowing Pang Lanxi’s heart to return to clarity. 

Chen Ping'an raised his wine flask, shaking it lightly, “I travel the world, I drink wine.” 

Pang Lanxi curiously asked, “Is the wine really that good?” 

Chen Ping'an remained silent, merely drinking. 

He continued to patiently await news from Ghostly Trap Valley. 

In fact, there were some things Chen Ping'an could explain more clearly to the youth. However, once he laid out that thread, it could potentially involve the Dao, which was a taboo among mountain cultivators. Chen Ping'an would not cross that line. 

Furthermore, the innocent and muddled feelings of young boys and girls are, in some ways, a form of beauty; why shatter that by explaining everything in detail? 

Pang Lanxi departed, saying that at least two sets of the hard yellow versions of the goddess murals were a sure thing, just wait for his good news. 

As Chen Ping'an watched Pang Lanxi nearly walk out the courtyard gate, he suddenly called out to the young man, smiling, “Oh, and remember one thing: if you find what I said makes sense, when you act on it, think carefully. Not every piece of advice that sounds good is necessarily suitable for you.” 

Pang Lanxi waved his hand, chuckling, “I’m not really that stupid; don’t worry, I’ll figure it out myself!” 

Chen Ping'an then got up and walked around the stone table, practicing the Six-Step Stance. 

As dusk fell, after stopping his practice, Chen Ping'an turned to look. 

From the direction where the white bone law image and the golden-armored deity had appeared over the Bone Marsh, a figure approached riding the wind. 

When a terrestrial immortal does not deliberately restrain their aura while traveling the winds, it often creates a thunderous sound, causing a great disturbance. However, once they reach the Fifth Realm, they can “merge with the Dao” and move quietly, almost without a ripple in their aura. 

The figure racing toward Muyi Mountain should be Zhu Quan, the sect leader of the Pima Sect in the Jade Purity realm. Yet, this still caused such a great commotion, either to deliberately intimidate some hidden forces lurking in the Bone Marsh or due to serious injuries sustained in Ghostly Trap Valley, resulting in unstable cultivation. 

The figure shot up into Muyi Mountain, suddenly halting, before darting like an arrow towards the half-mountain residence. 

Within the small courtyard, the gusts of wind stirred, causing Chen Ping'an’s sleeves to rustle. 

It was indeed Zhu Quan, who had been cultivating in Qinglu Town. 

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists, “Thank you, Sect Leader Zhu.” 

Zhu Quan waved her hand, taking a seat at the stone table. Upon seeing the wine flask on the table, she beckoned, “If you truly have sincerity, quickly offer me a jug of wine to quench my thirst.” 

Chen Ping'an sat opposite her and took out a jug of rice wine, “This is just local rice wine, not celestial brew from the mountain.” 

Zhu Quan removed the clay seal, tilting her head to take a large gulp, wiping her mouth afterward, “It’s a bit bland, but at least it’s wine, not water.” 

She glanced at the quiet young man sitting across from her and asked, “Are you acquainted with Pu’s head? I didn’t observe your earlier exploits in Ghostly Trap Valley, even when you were clashing with Yang Ningxing. I really don’t know how capable you must be to make Pu’s head draw his sword for you.” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not familiar. To be precise, we have some past grievances. In Crow Ridge, I had a conflict with a female ghost from the Greasy City, and it was Pu Rang who stopped me from pursuing Fan Yunluo. Later, Pu Rang proactively sought me out once, and seeing him in a green robe with a sword, I asked him why he didn’t covet the long sword on my back.” 

Zhu Quan mused aloud, “So, it seems these two are indeed cut from the same cloth?” 

How so? Wearing a green robe and wielding the same sword makes one exceptional? 

However, Zhu Quan glanced at the wine flask and decided to let it go. After all, any outsider with Jiang Shangzhen’s reputation in front of her would seem like a fine young man. Moreover, this young man had introduced himself as “Chen Ping'an of Dali’s Piyun Mountain,” and she was quite fond of that deal. 

Piyun Mountain was well-known to Zhu Quan, and she had even heard of the deity Wei Bo from Dali’s North Mountain several times. The Pima Sect’s financial routes in other continents relied heavily on that intercontinental ferry. 

Moreover, Zhu Quan believed this young man’s second statement, that he had a share in the cattle horn ferry. Therefore, for the next five hundred years, the Pima Sect would not need to spend a single Snowflake Coin for all docking fees associated with the ferry. Zhu Quan felt this was a long-term deal that she wouldn’t need to spend a copper coin on. 

If this were to get out, who would still dare to say that their sect leader was a wasteful woman? 

Yet Zhu Quan still felt somewhat frustrated; this young man bore too much resemblance to her sworn enemy, Pu's head, and joked, “Actually, you’ve made it unnecessary. When you approached me before, there was no need for you to offer any conditions. As long as it was aimed at the north, be it Jingguan City or any bone figure I dislike, I would have acted to stop it. Are you feeling a bit pained right now? Is your little heart trembling?” 

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Zhu Sect Leader’s boldness is the great demeanor of the Pima Sect. However, as a guest and a junior, I cannot be lacking in manners; I should still have the proper etiquette.” 

Zhu Quan rubbed her chin, “That’s good to hear, but why does it sound so displeasing?” 

Chen Ping'an took out another flask of wine. 

Zhu Quan nodded, smiling, “Though it sounds displeasing, you are much more pleasing to the eye.” 

Chen Ping'an then took the previously unfinished jug of rice wine and slowly drank. 

Zhu Quan glanced at how the young man was daintily drinking and shook her head, finding it less pleasing to the eye again. 

“No need to bring out more wine.” 

After finishing a second jug, she placed the empty flask heavily on the table, “Pu’s head has really angered Jingguan City this time. Things won’t go well for him. But he never seems to care about that. Gao Cheng is also annoyed with him. If they fight, it can’t be half-hearted; otherwise, they might actually kill Pu’s head. But Jingguan City will also suffer some losses in vitality. If they don’t fight, they can’t help it either, as Gao Cheng has lost face this time. First, he was unable to kill you, and then he was held up by that Jiang dog’s broken net for half the day. When Gao Cheng retreats back to Ghostly Trap Valley, guess what? He wouldn’t dare to tear that net, which is full of Snowflake Coins, completely apart. He can only pinch his nose and take it back. Hahaha! Before Gao Cheng became famous in the Bone Marsh, he probably got used to this kind of frugality. He never expected to see this day after becoming famous! Jiang Shangzhen, that scoundrel, unexpectedly managed to do one good deed in his life.” 

Zhu Quan felt delighted and laughed heartily, naturally reaching out her hand. 

Chen Ping'an sighed inwardly and placed a third jug of rice wine on the table. 

Zhu Quan began to drink; perhaps she felt it would be inappropriate to keep asking for more wine, so she started sipping slowly to make it last. 

She was indeed the lord of Jingguan City. 

The most powerful spirit in Ghostly Trap Valley. 

When Chen Ping'an had decided to escape Ghostly Trap Valley, he had speculated about all the Nascent Soul spirits recorded in the Northern “Rest Assured Collection,” carefully filtering them through. Gao Cheng from Jingguan City naturally came to mind, but the likelihood seemed low. This was because, as with Pu Rang from White Cage City or the two reclusive masters from the Great Round Moon Temple and the Lesser Xuandu Temple who bypassed the area, the higher the cultivation, the higher the vision. 

What Chen Ping'an had said on the banks of the Black River, “To attain this fruit, one must possess this heart,” was indeed applicable in a broader sense, although it did not apply to wild cultivators. There are many surprises in this world, and nothing is guaranteed. Thus, even though Chen Ping'an thought that the chances of Gao Cheng being part of Yang Ningxing’s so-called northern surveillance were minimal, he was someone who habitually thought of the worst scenarios and treated Gao Cheng as a hypothetical enemy. 

Otherwise, why would Chen Ping'an, already in Qinglu Town, with the sect leader Zhu Quan just a few steps away, need to spend two golden shrinks to break open the sky and leave Ghostly Trap Valley? 

Moreover, prior to this, he had already begun to suspect that Qinglu Town harbored spies from Jingguan City. He had even taken a detour to Copper Stench City. This escape plan truly began to operate quietly when he tossed that small summer coin to the city’s garrison officer. 

In fact, deep within Chen Ping'an’s heart, he had already managed to find a rough thread, a connection. 

Along this thread, there would be numerous key nodes, such as the Iron Cable Bridge at the cliff, where Yang Ningxing had mentioned her feelings. 

By the Black River, the old monk gazed across the river, chanting a line that seemed casual: “Turning back is the shore.” 

Upon entering what should have been the safest Qinglu Town in Ghostly Trap Valley, he instead found himself unable to draw talismans—a state of restless mind that was extremely rare. 

If pushed back further, it would be the three fortunes of the goddess murals in Mural City, the Deer-Riding Goddess stepping out of the painting and heading toward the Shimmering River ferry to test him. 

Mural City was indeed the first place Chen Ping'an had stepped into when venturing into the Northern Julu Continent! 

Yang Ningxing’s pure evil thoughts had been refined into a mustard seed; the scholar had once spoken at the riverside shrine, saying he had never won against Chen Ping'an. 

In this world, fortunes and misfortunes are always intertwined. 

Chen Ping'an felt deeply about this. 

What would happen if one’s mind were solely immersed in prolonged fortunes? 

At this moment, even though Chen Ping'an had already distanced himself from Ghostly Trap Valley and was on Muyi Mountain of the Pima Sect, he still felt a lingering fear. 

Imagine for a moment, if he had become a successful baggage dealer in Copper Stench City, logically, he would naturally continue northward. After all, he had faced numerous difficulties along the way, but all had been harmless, allowing him to pick up small gains here and there. 

There had been no major windfall in sight, yet he had encountered continuous good fortune, earning a bit here and a bit there. Moreover, the Deer-Riding Goddess had ultimately nothing to do with him, the Thunder Pool at Jixiao Mountain had nothing to do with him, and the fortunes of Treasure Mirror Mountain were irrelevant to him as well. 

Chen Ping'an appeared to rely solely on his caution, coupled with “a bit of luck.” This seemed to be the most comfortable and least dangerous state for him. 

Chen Ping'an squinted and drank the last bit of rice wine in the jug. 

Zhu Quan glanced at the long sword strapped to Chen Ping'an’s back, lightly shaking her head, feeling it shouldn’t be that object. 

Although Gao Cheng from Jingguan City was the sworn enemy of the entire Pima Sect, throughout generations, the leaders of the Pima Sect had acknowledged this ghostly spirit lord from Ghostly Trap Valley, in terms of both cultivation and disposition, as quite commendable, truly a hero among ghosts. 

Thus, even if the young man truly carried a semi-immortal weapon, Gao Cheng wouldn’t covet it to such an extent, nor would he be this agitated. 

Zhu Quan, after preparing her words, finally said, “I won’t ask why you’ve attracted Gao Cheng’s targeting. You don’t need to proactively mention it; that’s your business with him. Of course, fighting against Gao Cheng and Jingguan City is within the duties of us Pima Sect cultivators. Life and death are without grievance, and you need not feel compelled to assist or owe favors because you are seeking refuge in my Muyi Mountain after escaping this time.” 

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Understood.” 

Zhu Quan laughed, “Good young man, don’t be too polite.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 580: Unbound by Heaven and Earth**

In the Peach Grove of Ghostly Valley, within the Xiaoxuandu Temple, the old Daoist priest stood beneath a towering peach tree. Mist swirled at his feet, gradually unfurling like a massive landscape painting.

As the scene unfolded, a scholar stepped into the bustling Copper Scent City, preparing to participate in what seemed like a farcical imperial examination.

The young Daoist boy, Xu Song, clutched a whisk in his hands, his heart racing. Trembling, he exclaimed, "Master, is this the legendary 'Time-Lapse Galloping Painting'?"

The old Daoist nodded, "The headmaster of the Cloud Palace, from the Chongxuan Division of the Daguang Dynasty, personally penned a letter to our Xiaoxuandu Temple. He seeks my assistance in safeguarding Yang Ningxing's path. To ensure the good deed is completed, I created this painting. But rest assured, this is merely a copy of the true galloping painting; the cost will not be great. Others can only view it three times. The reason I show you once is for you to learn from it. Sometimes, one can gain insight from the experiences of others."

Xu Song's shock was evident. "That little Heavenly Lord from the Chongxuan Division has his brother retrieving something from the Mirror Mountain. Yang Ningxing is merely here for leisure in Ghostly Valley; why the need for such precautions?"

The old Daoist chuckled, "At first, I too was puzzled. But I suspect it involves a conflict over the Great Way. Once you finish viewing this painting, the truth will become clear."

Xu Song widened his eyes, unwilling to miss a single detail of the painting.

However, the actions of Yang Ningxing in Copper Scent City were truly disheartening. If this painting wasn’t the galloping painting, Xu Song might have thought his master was overreacting, and the headmaster of Cloud Palace was simply worrying unnecessarily.

But when Xu Song saw the peeling mountain goddess consumed as black smoke by the "scholar," and the young swordsman lurking atop the wall, his expression turned grave.

As he continued to watch, his heart raced, thoughts swirling chaotically.

When the landscape painting finally came to an end, it transformed into a scroll gently held by his master.

The old Daoist smiled, "What are your thoughts?"

Xu Song, drenched in cold sweat, replied, "If I were that… good-hearted brother, I’d have died at Yang Ningxing’s hands several times over."

The old Daoist nodded, "If you were that person, you would never escape Ghostly Valley."

Recalling the commotion in Qinglu Town and the subsequent chaos, Xu Song felt a sense of despair.

The old Daoist looked at his proud disciple and smiled, "What’s the matter? Do you feel inferior to others now? If I told you this wandering hero is merely in his early twenties, would you still want to throw yourself under that peach tree?"

Sweat beaded on Xu Song's forehead.

The old Daoist shook his head with a sigh, "Foolish child. In a life where fortune and peril coexist, is each gamble truly a good thing? Becoming entangled in worldly matters, bound by cause and effect, is terrifying for a cultivator. Let’s say you, Xu Song, truly aren’t like that person. Does that mean you should stop cultivating and seeking the Dao? If I were to think of the Dao Ancestor high above, then the three sect leaders a little lower, and further down, the ascended immortals within the White Jade Capital, would I just give up hope?"

Xu Song looked up, his eyes blank.

The old Daoist lightly tapped Xu Song’s forehead, "As Daoists, we cultivate our own paths and our own affairs. Our greatest enemy lies in the cycle of life and death, not in others. The rise and fall of others has nothing to do with us. In my view, perhaps the truest way is one that doesn’t require competition at all. But… enough of that; it’s pointless to say more."

Taking a step back, Xu Song bowed deeply, "Master, I think I understand a bit more now."

The old Daoist nodded in satisfaction, "That’s enough."

Originally, each mural was a doorway to a celestial secret realm. 

As all eight murals transformed into simple sketches, the spiritual energy of this celestial cave diminished significantly, becoming an ordinary secret realm, still a treasure of feng shui but devoid of any stunning allure.

Jiang Shangzhen wandered within, feeling quite disheartened. 

After cutting through the sky with his birth item, a willow leaf, and returning to the Bone Beach, he didn’t leave Beijulu Province immediately. Instead, he quietly came to this secret realm.

Some things that he couldn’t figure out always gnawed at his heart.

Moreover, hiding here served two purposes: it was safer than hiding on Mirror Mountain, and he feared that any residual repercussions from crossing paths with He Xiaoliang would be quite dreadful. That ruthless woman had an astonishing amount of fortune; if she developed a grudge against him, it was highly likely that as long as he, Jiang Shangzhen, remained within Beijulu Province, he would incur inexplicable misfortune. Nothing catastrophic, but it would certainly be bothersome. For example, Jiang Shangzhen was currently worried that if he revealed himself on the Bone Beach or Mirror Mountain, he might inadvertently encounter some wandering elder from the south, who would then burst into tears, lamenting their past. Jiang Shangzhen could hardly tolerate such reunions.

Yet, as Jiang Shangzhen lay in the flowers of the secret realm, sitting on a richly embroidered bed, leaning against a fragrant dressing table, or perched on the high balcony where celestial maidens had surely rested, he found that there were still some matters he could not fully comprehend. It felt like, in the blink of an eye, nearly three days had passed.

If he couldn’t figure it out, he could always ask.

Jiang Shangzhen took his birth item and knocked insistently at a door.

Soon, the familiar face of the old ancestor from the Pima Sect appeared. Upon seeing him, the ancestor felt a surge of anger and shouted, "Jiang Shangzhen, get lost! Our Pima Sect has no dog food for you!"

Jiang Shangzhen sat on a railing, looking down at the irate elder with a cheeky grin. "Come now, let’s talk things out. I’m now your Pima Sect’s ally…"

The old ancestor didn’t waste any words and prepared to attack.

Jiang Shangzhen quickly raised his hands, speaking earnestly, "I have something to discuss with your sect leader, Zhu Quan. And that guest of yours on the mountain, it’s best if they come over to chat."

The elder had already summoned his birth item, and his demeanor suggested it was no mere warm-up.

Jiang Shangzhen lightly tapped on the railing, helplessly saying, "This is a valuable property of your Pima Sect. Fighting here will only cost you."

The elder sneered. When his birth wooden plaque appeared, four statues of Heavenly Kings emerged around him, their limbs starting to move slowly, golden light gathering in their eyes.

Jiang Shangzhen feared that Beijulu Province’s cultivators would engage in such antics—they were the type to throw down first and ask questions later.

In the past, Jiang Shangzhen might have fallen for this. Back then, he was merely at the Golden Core stage but proudly proclaimed himself the best at causing trouble, the best at fighting and cursing, and the best at fleeing when things went awry. He considered himself among the top three troublemakers. However, this trip to Beijulu Province, Jiang Shangzhen had no intentions of re-entering the fray.

Jiang Shangzhen glanced up, feeling relieved.

In the skies above the secret realm, a pair of embroidered shoes appeared amidst the sea of clouds, initially large as hills, blocking the sun, but upon landing, they returned to their normal size.

Zhu Quan appeared alongside Chen Pingan.

The two materialized in the corridor atop the lofty pavilion.

Zhu Quan ordered the old ancestor to return to Mirror Mountain.

The elder cursed as he put away his birth item and the four Heavenly King statues.

Jiang Shangzhen burst into laughter, jumping down from the railing, "Little Quan’er, they say that a day apart feels like three autumns. We’ve practically been apart for ten years. Did you miss me? I know you didn’t miss me at all, right?"

Zhu Quan didn’t bother to glance at him, turning to Chen Pingan, saying, "Don’t worry. If any trouble arises, I’ll be there. I’d be more eager to deal with this lecher than to flatten Jingguan City."

Jiang Shangzhen took no offense, leaning against the railing, fanning himself with his hand, and said with a smile, "Little Quan’er, you’re just as lively and adorable as ever."

Zhu Quan vanished, returning to Mirror Mountain through the sea of clouds.

Once the old ancestor of the Pima Sect and Zhu Quan left, Jiang Shangzhen waved his sleeve, producing one bizarre treasure after another, directly sealing off the entrance to Mirror Mountain and the other eight mural doors.

Then, from the sea of clouds, Zhu Quan’s muffled voice could be heard, "Jiang Shangzhen, are you looking for trouble?" followed by a violent shaking of the clouds, indicating Zhu Quan had started banging on the door at Mirror Mountain.

Jiang Shangzhen waved his sleeve again, more resplendent treasures swirling out to completely block the entrance to the sea of clouds, and he declared loudly, "If I commit violence here, I’ll have Zhu Quan kill me as soon as I step out, how about that?"

Chen Pingan remained unfazed, lifting a jug of wine and tossing it to Jiang Shangzhen, saying, "Thanks."

Jiang Shangzhen, no longer in a joking mood, sighed, "I’m curious, do you have any idea who went after you?"

Chen Pingan chuckled, "Isn’t it Gao Cheng?"

Jiang Shangzhen, for once, didn’t crack a joke, just gazing intently at Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan lightly jumped up and sat on the railing, with Jiang Shangzhen joining him, both sipping wine.

Chen Pingan said, "Now that you mention it, I’m certain."

Jiang Shangzhen, puzzled, replied, "Then I’m even more confused. I’ve checked your past through various channels, and logically, you shouldn’t have such a deep connection with her."

Chen Pingan interjected with a tangential remark, "Zhu Sect Leader mentioned to me earlier that after Pu Rang from White Cage City drew his sword against Gao Cheng, she responded, ‘Swordsmen act without restraint from heaven and earth.’ It was quite apt."

Jiang Shangzhen took a large gulp of wine, his cheeks bulging as he swallowed, sounding like he was gargling. Then, with a tilt of his head, he swallowed it down.

He took another swig, this time not in a hurry to swallow.

After all, he had merely tossed a net worth about seventy or eighty grains of Rain Money into Ghostly Valley, but having witnessed such a performance, he felt he had gained rather than lost.

Was talking about money with me, Jiang Shangzhen, an act of humiliation?

"The reason I’m entangled with He Xiaoliang," Chen Pingan said flatly, "is that bastard Lu Chen set me up."

Jiang Shangzhen spat out his drink.

He quickly wiped his mouth, looking forlorn. "Even within this celestial ruins, it’s improper to directly call out a sage’s name like that."

Chen Pingan smiled, "Some grievances, whether you curse a few more times or a few less, won’t change anything."

"Chen Pingan, speak to me from the heart," Jiang Shangzhen blinked and shifted slightly, pointing above, "Is that person definitely out to kill you?"

Chen Pingan shook his head, "It’s not that extreme. The old debts are mostly settled. Someone like her, in charge of the lives of countless beings, doesn’t have that much time to deal with me. But she definitely looks down on me. So, whether I should travel through the Qingming World in the future, I’m quite hesitant."

In the vast world of Haoran, along with the other three realms, Chen Pingan wanted to traverse them all.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 581: The Source of Vitality Enters the Heart

Jiang Shangzhen finally sat back against the railing. If Lu Chen was truly set on targeting Chen Ping'an, he would simply retreat to the Book of Documents Lake at Baoping Continent like a turtle, hiding away. After all, the lake was vast and deep; if one wasn’t going to be a turtle, would they rather be a bird out of the forest? Old Xun had nagged him a thousand times that when one arrived at Book of Documents Lake, they should quickly adapt to the local customs and act like a local bully, rather than seeing themselves as some dragon crossing the river.

Chen Ping'an spoke, “If you know there are things you won’t get involved in, then just say what you can.”

Jiang Shangzhen took a sip of wine, nodding as he said, “Gao Cheng has great ambitions—so ambitious it could scare someone to death. He actually wants to build a place in Ghostly Valley that lies between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead, a Fengdu Underworld. The cycle of life and death for humanity could be generated there. Once realized, there are two immense benefits. First, it would reverse the feng shui of Ghostly Valley, elevating it to a complete cave paradise, no longer just a small realm. With heaven, earth, and humanity all present, it could truly give birth to the rising sun and setting moon, the orderly four seasons, and the cyclical changes of the world. Gao Cheng would then be the real deity here, surpassing all the saints who govern small realms. He might even take a leap straight from the Jade Pure Realm to the Ascendant Realm. By then, Gao Cheng would be akin to those rare oddities in the world, truly enjoying great freedom, breaking open the cages of heaven and earth. Those who could kill him would likely be overwhelmed by their lofty ambitions and might not even act. The ones who genuinely want to kill Gao Cheng, however, would find it impossible.”

“And secondly, in any future battles, even if the Pi Ma Sect suppresses him firmly in Ghostly Valley, both Gao Cheng and Jingguan City would remain on solid ground, virtually unbeatable. Furthermore, for every Pi Ma Sect cultivator that dies, it would only add to the foundation of Ghostly Valley. If the Master Hall of Mu Yi Mountain faces unexpected troubles and accidentally gets Gao Cheng leading his army out of the Bone Marsh, it could spell disaster for the kingdoms and fiefdoms along the northern Chaotic River. At that point, not to mention the Pi Ma Sect with fewer than two hundred cultivators, even a coalition of several southern sects wouldn’t gain any advantage.”

Jiang Shangzhen tightened his grip around the neck of the wine jug and gently swayed it, continuing, “Thus, Gao Cheng’s actions are quite taboo. However, his rise from a nameless ordinary foot soldier to today is not by chance; he isn’t a fool. He acts with great discretion, advancing step by step. I suspect that within a century, he will be extremely restrained, taking down only one Pi Ma Sect before stopping, encompassing the territory of the Bone Marsh. He would then halt his expansion for the next thousand years, cultivating distant alliances while attacking nearby enemies, hoping to swallow another sect, gradually establishing Jingguan City as more legitimate. As for how the Confucian Academy will react, it’s hard to say; there are just too many rules, and they often end up in internal conflicts, leading to many situations becoming set in stone.”

“Therefore, during this period, the forces that will truly clash with Gao Cheng will be two: one is the rigidly stubborn Pi Ma Sect, and the other is the Buddhism practitioners. After all, others are constructing Fengdu in the mortal realm, unilaterally opening the Six Realms of Reincarnation, which is something Buddhism absolutely does not want to see. As for the Daoists of North Ju Lu Continent, the Yang family from the Xuanguan Office of the Da Yuan Dynasty, and Tianjun Xie Shi, they may not necessarily detest Gao Cheng’s actions. The former will probably sit back and watch the tigers fight, letting Gao Cheng and the Buddhist forces of North Ju Lu wear each other down, especially the latter. As for the reason, you should already know, so I won’t elaborate.”

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled, “That phrase ‘leave the flying sword’ was shouted by Gao Cheng himself.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, glancing down at the Sword Nourishing Gourd, recalling a detail from before, “I understand now. I was like a child clutching gold while walking through the market, inadvertently bumping into the arms of Gao Cheng from Jingguan City. No wonder he was so furious; if it weren’t for the Master Hall of Mu Yi Mountain activating the mountain protection array, I probably wouldn’t have made it out of Ghostly Valley alive, even if I had escaped from the Bone Marsh.”

Jiang Shangzhen waved his hand, “What child? You don’t need to belittle yourself so. It’s more accurate to say you’re a commoner clutching a precious item.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “What do you think Gao Cheng plans to do now?”

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, “He’s probably setting up scarecrows in Jingguan City. Once a fortuitous opportunity is missed, it’s harder to grasp than ascending to the heavens. Such matters are difficult to clarify with logic; however, those on the mountain must believe, and the older they get, the more they tend to believe. So, you don’t need to worry too much; surviving great calamities brings blessings.”

Chen Ping'an forced a smile, “I don’t even dare to leave Mu Yi Mountain now, let alone cross the Bone Marsh to head north. Who knows if Gao Cheng will stealthily slip out of Ghostly Valley and stab me from behind?”

Jiang Shangzhen was about to explain when...

Chen Ping'an suddenly gazed into the distance, his expression darkening, “If I were Gao Cheng, as long as Chen Ping'an dares to wander through Ju Lu Continent, he would surely die.”

For a moment, Jiang Shangzhen was speechless. 

Speaking too much and urging Chen Ping'an to continue wandering through Ju Lu Continent felt like harboring ulterior motives.

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, “Jiang Shangzhen, why are you deliberately making an enemy of Gao Cheng inside Ghostly Valley? If I’m not mistaken, according to your words, since Gao Cheng is so ambitious, he would likely do business with you and the Yu Gui Sect, allowing you to become a guest of honor in Jingguan City.”

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, “Then I must be acting on impulse. I can’t stand seeing women being bullied, nor can I tolerate Pu Rang’s kind of boastful rhetoric that makes one’s hair stand on end.”

Chen Ping'an offered the wine jug, and Jiang Shangzhen clinked it lightly against his, both taking a sip.

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly asked, “What do you think of Zhu Quan? And Pu Rang? How is the temperament of the Pi Ma Sect?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “They are enticing.”

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “If, and I mean if, you still intend to continue your journey through North Ju Lu Continent, you must be cautious. This place indeed has characters like Zhu Quan and Pu Rang, but there are also those who might appear similar to them yet are far more cunning and treacherous than I, Jiang Shangzhen.”

Jiang Shangzhen slowly drank, “I’ve suffered two major losses in North Ju Lu Continent. Once, I almost lost my life while counting someone else's money, only to find out the person who stabbed me was actually my closest friend in North Ju Lu Continent. That awful feeling is still fresh in my memory. How to put it? It’s quite humiliating. The first thought that crossed my mind was not despair or anger, but whether I, Jiang Shangzhen, did something wrong to make this friend act like this.”

Chen Ping'an said, “I will be careful.”

Jiang Shangzhen sighed, a pitiful look on his face, “If I had known you had a grudge with that person sooner, I would have never come to this Ghostly Valley, what was I thinking?”

Chen Ping'an felt like laughing but thought it would be unkind, so he quickly took a sip of wine to swallow down his amusement.

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, recalling something, “Let me tell you some not-so-good news. That innate Dao seed Yang Ningxing from the Yunxiao Palace, the male student who ended up with the evil thought seed he left behind after using the Three Corpse Slaying Technique, has been hindered by you, but he hasn’t delayed his main business. The old Daoist from the Little Xuan Du Temple must have helped him protect his path, and in the end, he even obtained that pair of quite valuable golden fish from the Old Dragon Cave, which had been raised for a millennium by the Old Turtle. This was no small fortuitous encounter. Don’t think it’s insignificant; anything I, Jiang Shangzhen, would consider ‘quite valuable’ is truly worth something. Just look at this kid’s luck; it’s at its peak. If you leave Ghostly Valley now and she’s not around, then if you wander north again through the Da Yuan Dynasty, encountering that scholar will be even more challenging for you.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Compared to Gao Cheng from Jingguan City, these are nothing.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “How do you know about Yang Ningxing’s background? How long has it been since you came to North Ju Lu Continent?”

Jiang Shangzhen burst into laughter, “Chen Ping'an, do you know how many beautiful confidantes I have in North Ju Lu Continent? Almost every hundred years, one or two will come to my Yu Gui Sect to find me, using various excuses to rekindle old memories. There’s even one who specifically ran to the Yun Ku Paradise, where the most difficult to shed beauty is none other than this. So I know everything that goes on in North Ju Lu Continent.”

Chen Ping'an shot him a sidelong glance, “It’s a skill for a man to be liked by many women, but if a man can be dedicated and focused, that’s true skill.”

Jiang Shangzhen waved his hand, “Different paths do not conspire together. In this world, the only thing that can make me, Jiang Shangzhen, dedicated is spending money.”

Chen Ping'an thought about how he had risked his life rummaging around in Ghostly Valley, and looking back, he was truly like a wild cultivator tying his waist to earn a living. Now you, Jiang Shangzhen, are telling me this?

Chen Ping'an recalled something and took out the Taotie robe he had stripped from Yang Ningxing, saying, “What about this? I can only tell it’s a secret talisman from Yunxiao Palace. I recognize the script, but I have no idea about its true origins or specific uses, or its power. Can you weigh its value for me?”

Jiang Shangzhen took the three gold-colored talismans from Yunxiao Palace, “The Bi Xiao Fu talisman, a branch of the Mountain and Valley talisman, is one of the specialties of the Xuanguan Office. The Yu Qing Guang Ming talisman has a strong imposing aura and a considerable range, but its killing power is mediocre. If it’s just to scare people, it’s quite good. The last one, the Yunxiao Zhan Kan talisman, is the real good stuff; its core contains four particles of divine light. Even I am somewhat tempted. However, good talismans cannot be used by just anyone; they need a series of ‘opening’ secrets, especially this Zhan Kan talisman, which is a secret passed down in the Yang family of Yunxiao Palace. Coincidentally, I have a sister from the Yunxiao Palace with whom I share a bond stronger than gold; we meet day and night with complete honesty...”

Suddenly, Jiang Shangzhen turned his head and looked at him with a strange expression.

Chen Ping'an had no intention of taking it back and took small sips of wine, “I know these three talismans are certainly worth less than your net value; just consider it better than nothing.”

Jiang Shangzhen slapped the three talismans onto the railing, laughing heartily, “Save it! Take them! I, Jiang Shangzhen, earn and spend freely. The true nature of a hero is not inferior to that Pu Gutu!”

Chen Ping'an turned to Jiang Shangzhen, “You really don’t want them? I’ve shown the utmost sincerity. I’m not like you, Jiang Shangzhen, who has a great family business and would never hesitate to spend a copper coin.”

Jiang Shangzhen sighed dramatically, “Heaven is my witness.”

Chen Ping'an swiftly snatched back the three talismans, along with the robe, and stored them in his dimensional space, smiling, “Then I’ll do a good deed till the end and ask you to explain in detail the opening secrets of these talismans.”

Jiang Shangzhen showed no displeasure; instead, he smiled even more broadly, thoroughly explaining the techniques to activate the talismans to Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an then pulled out a golden thunder whip he had excavated from Jixiao Mountain, about the length of his arm, “What’s the quality and value of this item?”

Jiang Shangzhen said, “This is an item manifested from the overflow of the Thunder Pool, suitable for refining into a ghost-hunting whip. Alongside the whip made from the bamboo of Qingshen Mountain, they are the world’s two greatest treasures, naturally suppressing the monsters and spirits in the earth. However, it also depends on the quality of the Thunder Pool and the green bamboo from Qingshen Mountain. The Jixiao Mountain Thunder Pool is still a bit lacking; if it were from the inverted mountain, this item wouldn’t need refining and would be a congenital treasure right away. As it stands, it’s merely a high-quality congenital spirit tool, and moreover, the item is still a bit small. If it were me, I wouldn’t even want to bend down to pick it up.”

Chen Ping'an roughly gauged the situation. He had the opportunity to refine the longest strand of the Thunder Pool’s golden whip into a walking stick, using it for a while before returning to Baoping Continent to present it to his first disciple. A golden stick would definitely please the master, and how could the disciple not like it?

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, “In this Ghostly Valley, do you have any recent acquisitions that you would like me to check out?”

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment but still took out the spring paintings that the Summer Goddess had kept hanging on the wall of her boudoir and handed them to Jiang Shangzhen.

At first, Jiang Shangzhen looked at them with interest, but after seeing the annotated cultivation diagram, he nodded and said, “This can be considered a kind of obscure path. Ordinary Daoshi cultivators skilled in dual cultivation can use this as one of the foundations for establishing their sect, helping lower-level cultivators reach mid-level status, belonging to convenient methods. Thus, this one is worth some money; the rest of those paintings, typically in the dead of night when one is sleepless, can only serve as entertainment.”

Chen Ping'an was surprised, “This one is so precious?”

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “That Moon Palace kid was simply blind and missed a chance of fate right in front of him. This spring painting is a copy of one of the twelve ‘Mountain Dao Companions’ illustrations, likely drawn by a defector from the Mei'er Sect in the Middle Earth Divine Continent. If it meets someone who recognizes its worth, it could easily be sold for twenty or thirty Gu Yu coins without breaking a sweat.”

At this point, Jiang Shangzhen couldn’t help but sigh internally.

That He Xiaoliang truly was a remarkable character. Her fortuitous encounters were almost maddening.

Therefore, Jiang Shangzhen originally felt a bit envious of this not-so-expensive mountain painting, but he didn’t dare to ask Chen Ping'an for it or buy it.

After Chen Ping'an put away the paintings, he fell silent.

Jiang Shangzhen began to change the subject, “Do you know that there’s a true Xuan Du Temple in the realm of Qingming?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I’ve never heard of it.”

Jiang Shangzhen unexpectedly revealed a hint of yearning, finishing his drink and casually tossing the wine jug away, “That is truly a fairy’s cave. The old temple master possesses a peach tree cave paradise, practicing profound Dao techniques, revered as one of the Earth Ancestors.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “What about the small Xuan Du Temple in Ghostly Valley’s peach forest?”

Jiang Shangzhen lowered his voice, smiling, “That’s equivalent to the branch of Xuan Du Temple left over in the Haoran realm. However, it’s somewhat unjustified. I’m not too clear about the specific inheritance. Back when I was hurrying to the northern part of Ju Lu Continent, I didn’t enter Ghostly Valley. After all, there were no stunning beauties in the Pi Ma Sect. If Zhu Quan were a bit better looking, I would have definitely visited Ghostly Valley.”

Chen Ping'an glanced at Mu Yi Mountain and the nearby “Heaven Gate Cloud Sea,” which had been quiet for a long time, but he felt that it wasn’t that the female sect leader had given up but that she was brewing for a final strike.

Jiang Shangzhen continued, “The small Xuan Du Temple might not have much significance, but that Grand Full Moon Temple is no ordinary place. That old monk was already a renowned monk in the continent long before appearing at the Bone Marsh, with deep Buddhist teachings. It’s said that he was a son of Buddha who lost in the debate of the Three Teachings, confining himself in a temple. And that Pu Gutu… Hahaha, you, Chen Ping'an, admire her greatly, but she is actually…”

Jiang Shangzhen burst into laughter, nearly in tears, “She’s actually a woman! This secret was something I spent a great deal of money to obtain, and the entire Pi Ma Sect may not even know. In Ghostly Valley, only Gao Cheng is probably aware of this.”

Chen Ping'an said irritably, “What’s wrong with a female sword immortal?”

Jiang Shangzhen finally managed to stop laughing, sighing, “It’s a pity she fell in love with a monk, and that’s quite troublesome.”

At this, Chen Ping'an was truly surprised and asked in a low voice, “Is it that old monk from the Grand Full Moon Temple?”

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “That’s why Pu Rang died on the battlefield, fighting to protect that temple from any military disasters. However, the causal relationships in this world are so mysterious; if she hadn’t died, that old monk might have attained Buddhahood long ago. Who can say clearly what is right or wrong, gain or loss in this matter?”

Chen Ping'an began to understand. 

Through Jiang Shangzhen’s words, he now grasped why the old monk had said those four characters earlier; that long chain of causality was already surfacing, and with Pu Rang’s addition, it became clearer.

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly said, “Your state of mind seems to have some issues. If you were merely aware of the crisis, according to your previous style, you would only become more decisive. In the last trip to Tong Chou City, even I, an outsider, could see that something was amiss with your actions.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “The source of vitality is unclear; hence the heart is muddled.”

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, “This is no small matter.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Let’s take it slow.”

Jiang Shangzhen asked, “Are you still planning to risk a journey north through Ju Lu Continent?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Things can be thought of step back, but still, when walking, one must meet challenges head-on.”

Jiang Shangzhen ceased to speak.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Then with the Xuan Du Temple having a peach forest cave paradise and you having your Yun Ku Paradise, isn’t it quite laborious to manage?”

Jiang Shangzhen cradled the back of his head with his hands, “If you get mired in the details, it truly becomes an endless problem with no solution.”

Chen Ping'an hummed in agreement, gazing into the distance.

Jiang Shangzhen lifted one leg, “After the eight mural deities left, this place became a cave paradise of comparatively poor quality. However, for the Pi Ma Sect, it has become a critical territory. If managed well, it’s equivalent to an additional Jade Pure Realm cultivator; if poorly managed, it could delay one or two Nascent Soul cultivators. Ultimately, it still depends on Zhu Quan’s capabilities. After all, cultivating any cave paradise or secret realm is like an endless pit, even more expensive than a sword cultivator. There’s no doubt that one day you, Chen Ping'an, will have to face this. Remember, when you reach that day, never think of yourself as a living Bodhisattva saving the suffering. Otherwise, good things can turn into disasters. In business, it’s all about money, not people, which is unavoidable. For instance, when my Yun Ku Paradise was at its peak, there were fifty million ants; it was like a bamboo forest, and I welcomed a once-in-a-millennium great year with a sudden surge of earth immortals appearing. I got carried away, and after going on a trip, I nearly died inside. In a fit of rage, I harvested a good portion, which led to my current estate.”

Chen Ping'an said nothing.

Jiang Shangzhen began to gather his treasures, gradually putting away the items that sealed the eight mural gates.

Only the gate to the Cloud Sea remained unmoved. Jiang Shangzhen wanted to see Zhu Quan's final strike, considering it a farewell gift to himself as he left North Ju Lu Continent.

Chen Ping'an said, “If one day I truly consider you a friend, wouldn’t that be terrifying?”

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, “Do you feel it goes against your true nature? Have you changed too much? For you, Chen Ping'an, it might be a bad thing. This may reflect the pros and cons of different paths. I, Jiang Shangzhen, seek change and adaptation; I just need my heart to anchor at the bottom of the lake, allowing the wind and rain to batter against me, without worrying about the turbulence on the lake. Therefore, the path of cultivation has been quite pleasant for me. Besides, having lived this long, I’ve seen so much; my responses have only become more adept. You, Chen Ping'an, seem to seek stability, and since you are still young, seeing good here and bad there makes you feel the need to be cautious, leading to you being bound and stumbling. Cultivation is naturally difficult. On the contrary, as long as you can endure, it’s a series of tempering and benefits. You and I, we are both different; there’s no high or low, good or bad, just different fates. In fact, it’s not just us; others like Gao Cheng, Zhu Quan, the old monk, and the old Daoist are the same. I’ve always believed that the path of cultivation itself has no distinctions of high or low; I don’t believe in dead-end paths.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Your words from start to finish are worth their weight in gold.”

Jiang Shangzhen felt quite proud, but then his expression shifted, smiling, “What about Sui Youbian?”

Chen Ping'an looked puzzled.

Jiang Shangzhen had a strange expression, extending his hands into fists, his thumbs moving, “Isn’t there anything?”

Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes, too lazy to reply.

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, “What a waste!”

Suddenly, a sound echoed.

A flash of light from the Cloud Sea cleaved through, and several radiant sealing treasures shattered and dispersed all at once. Jiang Shangzhen looked up and laughed heartily, “Xiao Quan’er’s sword technique is impressive! It has made your Brother Zhou Fei dizzy and his heart race!”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the several completely destroyed treasures and felt a pang of sympathy for Jiang Shangzhen. Now that was truly a waste!

“Let’s go! Xiao Quan’er doesn’t need to see me off!”

Jiang Shangzhen stood up, sweeping his sleeve and gathering the remaining treasures, simultaneously using his life-bound willow leaf to cut open a mural city gate. He transformed into a long rainbow and swiftly escaped, his speed comparable to that of a flying sword cultivator.

Chen Ping'an felt a twinge of envy. If he had the ability to escape like this, he could go back to Ghostly Valley, or even just take a stroll around Jingguan City without any issues, right?

Zhu Quan landed on the railing, exuding a fierce presence, filled with malice. After a moment’s hesitation, she chose not to chase Jiang Shangzhen into the mural city. Instead, she shouted, “Jiang, if you dare come to my Pi Ma Sect again, I’ll chop off three of your legs!”

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly poked his head out from the mural gate of the Hanging Ink Goddess, saying, “Don’t use that law sword; can you use your hand instead?”

Zhu Quan swung her sword in rage.

Half an hour later, Chen Ping'an finally waited for Zhu Quan to return to the cave. The female sect leader still carried a faint sea breeze, clearly having chased Jiang Shangzhen all the way to the sea.

Zhu Quan looked a bit frustrated as she sheathed her sword and sat on the railing, extending her hand.

Chen Ping'an tossed her a jug of rice wine.

Zhu Quan lifted her head and drank deeply, her expression not looking too good as she asked, “Are you friends with Jiang Shangzhen?”

Chen Ping'an remained calm, his heart steady, solemnly stating, “I was once a life-and-death enemy in a paradise in Tong Ye Continent; he was known as Zhou Fei back then.”

Zhu Quan shot him a glance, scoffing, “A man’s words are nothing but deceit.”

Chen Ping'an drank to calm himself.

Zhu Quan coldly huffed, “You could be associated with Jiang Shangzhen; I don’t think you’re a good person either.”

Chen Ping'an silently drank.

Zhu Quan exclaimed, “So you’ve admitted it?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I haven’t.”

Only then did Zhu Quan’s expression soften. “If you hadn’t said that thing about being dedicated, I would almost be compelled to stab you right now.”

Chen Ping'an could only smile wryly.

Zhu Quan said, “You can continue to travel north; I will keep a close watch on Jingguan City. If Gao Cheng dares to show his face again, it won’t just be about losing a hundred years of cultivation this time. Don’t worry; in Ghostly Valley and Bone Marsh, it’s extremely difficult for Gao Cheng to come and go quietly. The protective formation of the Pi Ma Sect will remain in a semi-open state. Gao Cheng, unless he’s willing to risk half his life, will at least fall back to the Nascent Soul realm. You will not face any danger at all; you can swagger out of the Bone Marsh without a care.”

Chen Ping'an felt slightly relieved.

Zhu Quan smiled, “If I were you, I would stand at the archway between the Bone Marsh and Ghostly Valley, shouting insults at Gao Cheng for three days and nights. As soon as he shows up, just rely on our Mu Yi Mountain’s ancestral mountain spirit to escape. Once Gao Cheng leaves, you can pop your head up and go back and forth, driving him mad. Wouldn’t that be delightful? After all, the money spent is ours from the Pi Ma Sect, and besides, we’d gladly spend that money.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I think I’ll take a fairy’s ferry around the Bone Marsh. After I get thousands of miles out, I’ll disembark and wander.”

Zhu Quan frowned, “You’re even worse than Jiang Shangzhen! If it were him, after suffering such a great loss, he would surely deal with Gao Cheng more harshly than I do. This guy, if nothing else, excels at being spiteful.”

Zhu Quan gave a thumbs up, “There was once a sect that had a huge grudge against him. He ended up blocking them for ten years, causing all Earth Immortal cultivators below to not dare to wander alone down the mountain. Before Jiang Shangzhen left, he even gifted a grand present; he set up seven or eight stone tablets covered in vulgarities around the mountain foot overnight, fabricating stories about all the sect's ancestors and Earth Immortal cultivators, male and female alike. The content was extremely filthy and lowly, yet it had some literary flair. To this day, those scandalous little books still circulate on the mountain.”

Chen Ping'an said helplessly, “Why would I compete with Jiang Shangzhen on this?”

Zhu Quan thought for a moment, “That’s true. Just don’t learn anything from this lecherous fool.”

Chen Ping'an felt a release of stress.

Dealing with this female sect leader was more exhausting than engaging in duels to the death.

Outside the peach forest, a skeletal ghost clad in a green robe stood beside two stone tablets, not entering the peach forest.

A frail old monk in a wide robe appeared before it.

It was indeed the skeletal ghost of Pu Rang, the city lord of White Cage City, who rasped, “So you finally dare to come see me?”

The old monk pressed his palms together, remaining silent.

Pu Rang pressed down on her sword hilt, and the sword immediately emitted a mist of sword energy, enveloping the old monk. Moments later...

Pu Rang remained as she was, only no longer a skeleton but a spirited young woman.

She slowly said, “Life is full of fears, and fate is precarious like the morning dew. From love comes sorrow, from love comes fear. I might no longer understand Buddhist teachings, but how could I not know these? I know it’s my delay that hindered you from breaking through your last barrier; it’s my fault. All these years, I deliberately roamed Ghostly Valley in this skeletal form to make you feel guilty!”

Once so clear-minded in life, now as a ghost, she remained resolute.

Recalling that year when she first saw a young monk wandering the world, he happened upon a rural girl laboring in the fields, one hand holding seedlings and the other wiping sweat.

In the sunlight, the girl, although not particularly beautiful, captivated the young monk, shaking his steadfast Buddhist heart.

Like a dream, like dew, like lightning.

At this moment, the old monk averted his gaze, his hands still pressed together as he softly said, “There’s no need for you to feel this way, Pu Master. It’s merely my own demonic thoughts that have caused the trouble. You just need to focus on the great Dao to attain immortality.”

Pu Rang smiled sadly, “It has always been like this.”

With that, she turned and left.

The old monk, after chanting a Buddhist phrase, also turned to depart.

At the junction of the path leading to the Grand Full Moon Temple and the Little Xuan Du Temple, the old Daoist appeared out of thin air, causing the old monk to halt in his tracks.

The old Daoist seemed to want to ask the old neighbor a question.

The old monk had clearly guessed, slowly saying, “That little practitioner once said by the Black River, ‘To attain this fruit, one must have this heart.’ I actually have something I never said to him: ‘To possess this heart is to attain this fruit.’”

The old Daoist asked, “Why not say it?”

The old monk smiled, “The Buddha on the Spirit Mountain is not far to seek, nor is there a need for external search.”

The old Daoist shook his head and vanished in an instant.

The old monk remained standing there, bending down and stretching out his hand as if scooping up a handful of water, murmuring, “With my hands full of green seedlings in the field, I lower my head and see the heavens reflected in the water.”

A ferry from the Bone Marsh didn’t head straight north but instead traveled to a certain place along the southeastern coast.

In the night, Chen Ping'an read a military book under the light.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 582: Some Encounters

Chen Ping'an closed the military book in his hand and opened a small book called *Spring Dew, Winter Presence*, akin to the *Assured Collection* of the Pima Sect. This little book served as an introduction to the heritage of the ferry's affiliated mountain, detailing its interesting history—who among the sword immortals from Northern Julu Continent had rested there, where the earth immortals had enjoyed tea and discussed the Dao, and the poems and calligraphy left by cultured visitors. It was filled with accounts of both significant and trivial events.

Beneath Chen Ping'an's feet was a ferry from the Spring Dew Garden, primarily engaged in selling rare flowers and herbs cultivated by the sect. Among them were three types of celestial flowers that the Pima Sect had nearly monopolized, constituting a major source of income for the Spring Dew Garden. Thus, the ferry's route shuttled back and forth between the Bone Marsh and the Jia Mu Mountain Range, where the Spring Dew Garden was located. The Spring Dew Garden was a farming sect among the myriad schools of thought, known for its many female cultivators and gentle disposition. In contrast, the Jia Mu Mountain Range boasted an abundance of rare trees and enchanting flora, making it a solid second-tier power in the southeastern region of Julu Continent, characterized by broad connections and few feuds. It was a popular spot for many young sect masters to hone their skills.

Chen Ping'an chose this ferry for three reasons: first, it allowed him to completely bypass the Bone Marsh; second, one of the Spring Dew Garden's ancestral treasures was a millennia-old locust tree growing in the Jia Mu Mountain Range, towering over dozens of meters. He wanted to see how it compared to the old locust tree back in his hometown. Finally, during the end of the year, the Spring Dew Garden hosted a year-end banquet, drawing thousands of merchants with their wares, creating a bustling scene of celestial currency. Chen Ping'an planned to engage in some minor trade there.

The *Spring Dew, Winter Presence* was not thin by any means, but compared to the meticulous detail of the *Assured Collection*, it felt like the ramblings of a family elder. Chen Ping'an regretted not being able to collect a similar book at the Fuyi Sect on Tongye Continent.

After reading through the little book, he began practicing the Six Steps Stance. By the end, he was almost half-asleep while practicing his punches, moving smoothly between the door and window.

At dawn, Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, stopped his practice, and returned to the table. After a brief wait, he heard a knock on the door. He stood up to open it, revealing a ferry manager, a rare male cultivator from the Spring Dew Garden—a weary looking old Golden Core cultivator. He couldn't be compared to Pima Sect's Du Wensi or Yang Lin; despite being in the same realm, their differences were as vast as the sky and the ground. Should they engage in combat, the outcome would be clear-cut. This, however, was not a reflection of the Spring Dew Garden's cultivators as a whole; it was merely that the Pima Sect had some exceptional practitioners who faced life and death in their daily lives.

The old cultivator, upon Chen Ping'an's opening of the door, apologized, "Sorry to disturb your rest, fellow Daoist."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Senior Song, you’re too kind. I just woke up. According to that little book, we should be nearing Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain, so I plan to head out and see if I can encounter the Golden-backed Goose or the Drumming Frog."

The old cultivator smiled back, "I came here for that very purpose. I thought I should remind you, young master Chen, that in about two hours, we will enter the territory of Golden Light Peak."

The Golden Core earth immortal slightly changed his address to a more familiar one.

Reciprocity.

Chen Ping'an quickly made way, saying, "Please, Senior Song, after you."

The old cultivator smiled knowingly. Among cultivators on the mountain, if their realms were not too far apart, like "I observe the sea, you observe the Dragon Gate," they could simply call each other fellow Daoists. However, a fifth realm cultivator addressing someone from the middle fifth realm or a cave-dwelling or observing sea Dragon Gate practitioner would need to show respect and refer to them as an immortal master or senior. The Golden Core realm was a threshold; after all, "Only those who have formed a Golden Core are counted among us." This rule was universally acknowledged.

Of course, those who were bold enough might still call someone from a higher realm a fellow Daoist, but they would have to be prepared for a severe consequence if things went awry.

As an old Golden Core, referring to this young guest as a fellow Daoist clearly carried significance.

Accompanying this young man to the ferry was the Pima Sect's direct disciple, Pang Lanxi, a highly regarded young prodigy rumored to potentially be among the next ten young talents of Northern Julu Continent within the next sixty years. If it were any other sect boasting about its disciples, it would likely be a ploy to enhance their reputation, merely a joke to listen to. In person, one would typically respond with casual agreement while inwardly cursing their audacity. However, the Spring Dew Garden was a familiar face around the Bone Marsh, well aware that Pima Sect cultivators were different—they did not boast and were known for their deeds.

If Pang Lanxi merely made an appearance to send off the Pima Sect's guests, it would not compare to the presence of the sect leader, Zhu Quan, or the wall painting city’s Yang Lin, who were far more intimidating. But the old Golden Core had been traveling for many years and was not the type to retreat into seclusion for decades, having developed a sharp insight. The admiration Pang Lanxi displayed at the ferry was unmistakable, even to this old Golden Core, who had no means to gauge the depth of the young man's background. 

After the recent cataclysmic events at Ghostly Mirage Valley and the Bone Marsh, where Jing Guan City’s Gao Cheng had revealed his skeletal dharma form and had personally pursued a fleeing Golden Sword light to the Pima Sect’s ancestral hall, the old cultivator was not foolish. He had pieced together the implications.

Two mountain cultivators, meeting by chance, one of them taking the initiative to open the door and invite the other to sit, exhibited a significant level of sincerity.

For cultivators, not being stained by worldly affairs was no mere saying.

The old Golden Core’s surname was Song, his name Lanqiao. According to the ancestral hall's genealogy, he was a member of the Lan clan from the Spring Dew Garden. Given that the Spring Dew Garden was predominantly female cultivators, a male disciple having the character "Lan" in his name was a bit unusual, so his master had added the character "Qiao" to temper the feminine aura.

Previously, Chen Ping'an had only heard from Pang Lanxi that Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain were places of significance, where one could encounter spiritual creatures if luck was on their side, so he had been attentive to the journey.

Coincidentally, Song Lanqiao had come to remind him of this matter, clarifying Chen Ping'an's confusion.

It turned out that the area around Golden Light Peak occasionally saw appearances of the Golden-backed Goose. This creature flew swiftly, like a sword immortal's flying sword, and lingered only briefly at Golden Light Peak unless one was at the Nascent Soul realm. Ordinary cultivators had little hope of capturing it. Moreover, the Golden-backed Goose had a fierce temperament; once captured, it would self-immolate, leaving its captor with nothing.

Golden-backed Geese preferred to fly high above the sea of clouds, especially enjoying basking in the sun. Because their backs were exposed to the scorching sun throughout the year and they could naturally absorb solar essence, an adult Golden-backed Goose could grow a single golden feather; two were rare, and three were even more elusive. There was a well-known wild Nascent Soul cultivator in Southern Northern Julu Continent who, by chance, became the master of a Golden-backed Goose whose entire body was covered in golden feathers when he was still in the fifth realm. This creature had combat strength comparable to a Golden Core cultivator. When it flapped its wings, it was like the sun ascending into the sky. This wild cultivator loved ambushes and had blinded countless cultivators below the earth immortal realm. After reaching the Nascent Soul, he chose to live a quiet life, becoming a thousand-year-old turtle, and since then, the Golden-backed Goose had vanished.

As for Moonlight Mountain, on the first and fifteenth of each month, a giant white frog, as large as a hill, would croak atop the mountain, surrounded by its progeny, absorbing moonlight. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the sound of frogs echoed throughout the mountain, making it known as Thunder Mountain. Many cultivators had tried to tame this giant frog, but it had extraordinary talents, skilled in earth escape techniques, able to shrink its massive body down to the size of a mustard seed, hiding within the earth veins. At the same time, Moonlight Mountain became as heavy as the five great mountains of a powerful nation, making it impossible for even Nascent Soul cultivators to uproot it. Therefore, cultivators typically attempted to capture a few hundred-year-old snow frogs on Moonlight Mountain. If they succeeded, it was considered a stroke of good luck, as the giant frog's ancestor was very protective.

Song Lanqiao humorously recounted many amusing tales involving the cultivators of Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain, and Chen Ping'an listened with great interest.

Once, someone set a net to capture a Golden-backed Goose, only to be lifted skyward by several other Geese. The cultivator stubbornly refused to let go, resulting in him being dragged into the upper reaches of the clouds. When he finally released his grip, he was left battered and naked, exposed to the spring sun without any protective talismans. The watching Qi cultivators from Golden Light Peak erupted in laughter, and it turned out to be a female cultivator from a major sect. Afterward, she never ventured out again.

Curiously, Chen Ping'an asked, "Don't any cultivators establish cave dwellings at Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain?"

Song Lanqiao stroked his beard and chuckled, "The solar essence at Golden Light Peak is too intense, especially the solar essence that gathers there, which flows chaotically and unpredictably. It hardly qualifies as a good place. Only earth immortals can barely reside there, while ordinary Qi cultivators would find it extremely tough, merely exhausting their spiritual energy. As for Moonlight Mountain, it is indeed a treasure trove of feng shui with all five elements in harmony. Unfortunately, that giant frog rules the mountain, with thousands of offspring, and the awakened giant frogs harbor a deep resentment against us Qi cultivators, making it impossible for us to practice there."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "The mountain and marsh spirits all have their means of survival."

Song Lanqiao seemed to agree wholeheartedly, smiling as he took his leave.

Polite interactions are essential, but going overboard might reduce one's stature. After all, he was a Golden Core cultivator and had to maintain a bit of face. If one needed assistance, that was another matter entirely.

After leaving the room, Song Lanqiao shook his head. This young cultivator still saw things too superficially. The Golden-backed Geese at Golden Light Peak and the giant frog at Moonlight Mountain were exceptions that did not suffer captivity. The majority of mountain spirits that perished to be exchanged for money were far more numerous. Just look at the various grass spirits and tree spirits of the Jia Mu Mountain Range; countless were sold off and perished midway. To be raised in the affluent households of a secular dynasty was already a tremendous stroke of luck.

As the ferry passed Golden Light Peak, it hovered in midair for an hour, yet not a single Golden-backed Goose appeared.

Song Lanqiao stood beside the young cultivator, explaining that many cultivators eyeing the spiritual birds had waited here for years, often seeing few.

Then, the Spring Dew Garden ferry gently continued its journey, passing by Moonlight Mountain under the night sky. They did not dare approach too closely, circling the mountain at a distance of seven to eight miles. Since it was not the first or fifteenth day of the month, the giant frog did not show itself. This left Song Lanqiao feeling a bit awkward, as the giant frog sometimes revealed itself outside of those dates to bask on the summit, absorbing moonlight. As a result, Song Lanqiao simply did not appear.

He watched as the young cultivator, wearing a bamboo hat, stood until the ferry had distanced itself from Moonlight Mountain before returning to his quarters.

Song Lanqiao couldn’t help but smile wryly. This young man’s luck was rather mediocre.

It was rare for ordinary ferries to pass by these couple mountains and encounter the Golden-backed Goose, and in two hundred years of managing this ferry, Song Lanqiao had seen it only a handful of times. However, whether passengers could see the giant frog at Moonlight Mountain was roughly a fifty-fifty chance.

Two days later, the ferry began to ascend slowly.

The young cultivator approached Song Lanqiao, inquiring about the reason for the elevation. Song Lanqiao did not hold back. This was a semi-public secret of ferry navigation, not considered taboo. Each well-established route had its own tricks. When passing through regions of spiritual beauty, the ferry would often lower its altitude to absorb the spirit energy from heaven and earth, slightly reducing the consumption of celestial currency. Conversely, in areas devoid of spirit energy—those "forbidden zones"—the closer to the ground, the greater the consumption of celestial currency, requiring a higher altitude. When it came to navigating within the realms of immortals, knowing how to take advantage of the situation without violating sect rules or the principles of cave dwellings was a skill that seasoned ferry operators had developed, emphasizing relationships with various factions.

Song Lanqiao shared these non-taboo secrets with the young cultivator without reservation.

It was a small act of kindness, and it cost nothing.

Song Lanqiao also surmised that this traveler was likely a direct disciple from a prominent sect who was focused solely on cultivation and unfamiliar with worldly affairs. Otherwise, someone with deeper knowledge would not be unaware of these rudimentary ferry operations. After all, understanding the heritage of a cultivation mountain and how far a ferry could travel—whether just a few tens of thousands of miles or across half a continent—was a straightforward indicator.

When seeking advice, Chen Ping'an took out a flask of celestial brew he had purchased from Bone Marsh. While it could not compare to the famous gloomy tea, it was called Windstorm Wine, renowned for its potency.

One day, Song Lanqiao suddenly left his quarters, ordering the ferry to lower its height. Half a stick of incense later, he arrived at the bow, leaning against the railing, squinting down at the land and rivers, catching sight of an unusual phenomenon. The old cultivator couldn’t help but express his amazement.

The ferry was not too high above the ground, and with the weather clear, visibility was excellent, allowing the mountains and rivers below to be distinctly observed. However, that peculiar sight was invisible to ordinary cultivators.

Song Lanqiao was merely there to enjoy the spectacle and would not intervene. This could also be seen as a personal indulgence. The few dozen snowflake coins spent on this extra half stick of incense would elicit only curiosity from the Spring Dew Garden's elders, who would simply ask Song Lanqiao what novelty he had spotted—there would be no concern for the expenditure. A Golden Core cultivator idly passing time on the ferry clearly indicated that he was a pitiful figure who had severed his path to greatness. Generally, people were hesitant to provoke ferry managers, especially one who was an earth immortal.

Chen Ping'an approached the old Golden Core, gazing towards a city shrouded in black mist, asking, "Senior Song, what’s going on with that city covered in black mist?"

"You have a good eye, young master Chen; even I find it a bit difficult to see clearly," Song Lanqiao stroked his beard and smiled. "That is a county city of the Silver Screen Kingdom. They seem to be facing some calamity, as the external signs are quite apparent. There are generally two possibilities: one is that some demon is causing trouble, and the second is that the local water deities or city gods are losing their grip, with their physical forms decaying to the point of collapse. While the Silver Screen Kingdom may seem vast, it is, in fact, a small nation in the southeastern part of Northern Julu Continent. Its lands are not rich in spirit energy, and it cannot produce Qi cultivators. Even if there are some, they mostly serve others, so such impoverished territories, like the Silver Screen Kingdom, are just empty shells, and cultivators seldom bother to visit."

Song Lanqiao's words clearly indicated that he regarded the young cultivator as a newcomer. However, upon carefully observing Chen Ping'an's expression, which was attentive and focused, Song Lanqiao relaxed. Indeed, this was likely a prominent disciple from another continent's sect. It was fortunate that he hailed from the Spring Dew Garden, known for its kindness. Had it been a ferry from the central or northern major sects of Northern Julu Continent, once they discerned his identity, they might playfully tease him, and should any friction arise, both sides would likely retaliate without holding back. It was common practice.

After a moment's hesitation, Song Lanqiao decided against offering any further warnings.

Disciples from prestigious sects value their pride above all else; better not to overstep and risk offending him.

Chen Ping'an surveyed his surroundings, adjusted his bamboo hat, and smiled, "Senior Song, I'm feeling a bit restless. I think I’ll go down and stretch my legs. It might be a while before we reach the Spring Dew Garden, so I’ll find you for a drink later. Departing the ferry may affect its formation slightly."

Song Lanqiao was momentarily taken aback, a bit surprised. However, cultivators often acted according to their whims, so the old Golden Core didn’t say much, only offering a few auspicious words.

Then the old cultivator noticed that the young Chen seemed somewhat awkward.

Why not use a sword? Even if he found it too conspicuous, riding the winds should be no issue.

Chen Ping'an could only pat his sword nurturing gourd, placing one hand on the railing as he leaped off, casually slicing through the ferry's formation with a light palm strike. He shot forth like an arrow, and as his feet seemed to land atop a streak of ethereal green sword light, he bent his knees slightly, suddenly exerting force and rapidly tilting downwards. The surrounding air rippled violently with a thunderous sound, causing the old Golden Core to blink in astonishment. Goodness, this young sword immortal, while still young, had a physique as resilient as one in the Golden Body realm!

“Damn it, a sword cultivator!” 

Chen Ping'an landed on a mountain peak, waving farewell from a distance.

Song Lanqiao, too, was understanding, ultimately a cultivator of manners, making it hard to dislike him.

Among mountain cultivators, parting amicably is quite a rarity.

Chen Ping'an retrieved a bamboo box and strapped it to his back.

The sword immortal seemed unwilling to leave the scabbard, evidently feeling frustrated from not having had a satisfying battle at Ghostly Mirage Valley.

As for the sword embryo formerly known as *Little Fengdu*, Chen Ping'an did not dare let it roam freely from the nurturing gourd.

Chen Ping'an took out a string of walnuts and slipped them onto his hand, then tucked three Yunsiao Palace talismans into his left sleeve.

It was a good thing he hadn’t encountered the Golden-backed Goose or the giant frog at Golden Light Peak and Moonlight Mountain.

The reason he chose this ferry from the Spring Dew Garden was due to a hidden motive.

After hesitating for a moment, Chen Ping'an decided not to rush off. Instead, he sought a secluded spot to begin refining the longest golden lightning whip from Jixiao Mountain. Roughly two hours later, he formed a rough prototype and, wielding a hiking staff, began to walk towards the county city of the Silver Screen Kingdom, which lay about fifty to sixty miles away.

Before parting with Pang Lanxi at the ferry, the young man had gifted him two sets of *Goddess Portraits*, the most prized works of his great-grandfather, worth their weight in gold. Each set was estimated to be worth a Gu Yu coin, rare and priceless. Pang Lanxi insisted that Chen Ping'an need not pay, as his great-grandfather had said that Chen Ping'an's earlier words at the residence were refreshingly unique, akin to an orchid in a secluded valley, and did not feel insincere.

Chen Ping'an shamelessly accepted the two sets of *Goddess Portraits*, smiling at Pang Lanxi and promising that the next time he returned to Bone Marsh, he would definitely share a drink with his great-grandfather.

Pang Lanxi was sincere and replied that his great-grandfather had only three sets of *Goddess Portraits* left; he had given one set to the chief law master of the ancestral hall. To ask for more in exchange for flattery would be unfair to his great-grandfather.

Chen Ping'an responded earnestly, saying that his great-grandfather had a profound understanding of the spiritual essence and charm of the wall painting city's goddesses. His brushwork was as if assisted by divine beings, flowing seamlessly from heart to pen, and from pen to paper, bringing the goddesses to life on the page, as if in telepathic connection with his great-grandfather. Everything fell into place effortlessly, a masterful creation...

Pang Lanxi was left dumbfounded.

However, as the ferry carrying Chen Ping'an drifted away, the young man felt a touch of reluctance.

He wanted to hear more of that fellow's insights on drinking.

Meanwhile, at a distance from the ferry, the Pima Sect's ancestor stared at his palm.

Beside him, Pang Shanling nodded and smiled, "Very much to my liking."

The ancestor had struggled for a long time but could not think of any flowery remarks, so he gave up and asked, "Do you really believe such commonplace pleasantries?"

Pang Shanling raised an eyebrow, "In your Pima Sect, I hear such things?"

The ancestor grew increasingly irritated, cursing the young wanderer for his shamelessness. If not for his acceptable behavior toward women, he might have been considered a second Jiang Shangzhen.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an was unaware of the Pima Sect's ancestor and Pang Shanling observing him with keen interest; he was simply a young wanderer in a green robe, carrying a hiking staff as he walked along the desolate mountain path in winter.

He hoped that the little mouse spirit guarding the gate of the Yechang Palace would have a lifetime's worth of books to read, safely traversing between Ghostly Mirage Valley and Bone Marsh, carrying a book box, and returning each time with a full load.

He hoped that the two monsters on the iron chain bridge would focus on their cultivation and not commit evil deeds, achieving enlightenment and longevity.

He hoped that the old tortoise, returning to the temple to listen to the scriptures, could make amends for past mistakes and attain enlightenment.

He wondered if the girl fox spirit hiding beneath the blue umbrella of Baojing Mountain could find a romantic partner to hold her umbrella against the rain.

And could that white-boned swordsman named Pu Rang, in addition to wielding a sword in his green robe, one day appear in the world as a woman, her frown replaced by a smile?

Chen Ping'an did not know if these things would come to pass.

Just as he did not know that, in the naive eyes of Pang Lanxi, the little mouse spirit, and the distant scholar Cao Qinglang in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, encountering him, Chen Ping'an, felt akin to his own youthful encounters with Ah Liang and Mr. Qi.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 583: Some Principles Are Self-Evident (Part 1)

As winter drew to a close, the sky was a cold, ashen blue, and the mountains lay frozen and devoid of clouds. Chen Ping'an surveyed his surroundings, and all he could see was a landscape of desolation.

This was the color of the mortal realm. On the ferryboat of the immortals, overlooking the vast mountains and rivers, one would never have such feelings. Therefore, cultivating on the mountains meant being oblivious to the seasons of the world.

In Chen Ping'an's hand was a walking staff refined from the Azure Palace's celestial formula, glimmering with a vibrant green hue. This made the staff resemble bamboo, and if not for the striking gold color, it would draw less attention. However, with just a single restriction lifted, this temporarily crude form of the demon-slaying staff belonging to the little alchemist could revert to its original appearance.

One good thing about North Julu Continent was that as long as one spoke the elegant language of the region, there was no fear of misunderstandings. In comparison, Baoping Continent and Tongye Continent had countless dialects and official languages, making travel quite troublesome.

Chen Ping'an walked to the foot of the mountain, still finding no one around. He gently pinched a talisman that emitted yang energy, and since it burned at a normal speed, it indicated that the possibility of demons causing trouble in the county city was minimal. It was highly likely the second scenario mentioned by the golden elixir cultivator Song Lanqiao: a certain local deity of mountains and rivers was on the brink of calamity, their golden body about to collapse, thus affecting the local feng shui and leading to natural disasters.

However, nothing was absolute. Chen Ping'an planned to take it step by step, holding onto his talismans as he walked slowly. Eventually, he encountered an ox cart filled with charcoal, driven by a rugged man in tattered clothes, accompanied by a pair of children whose hands were covered in frostbite, heading toward the county city. Only then did Chen Ping'an extinguish the talisman and quicken his pace. The two children looked at him with curiosity but, feeling shy, shrank back toward their father. The man saw the young traveler with a box and staff but didn’t say anything.

The winter chill made the ground hard and bumpy, causing the ox cart to jostle. The man dared not urge the ox to move too quickly; if the charcoal broke, it wouldn’t sell for a good price. The wealthy merchants in the city had sharp eyes and were good at haggling, their harsh words chilling the heart more than the biting wind. Yet, going too slow would leave the two children shivering, which weighed on the man’s mind. He had already told them not to come along for the excitement; there was nothing worth seeing in the city, just the stone lions at the doorsteps, which looked scary, and the painted door gods, which were even larger. Once they saw them enough, they would lose their novelty. If this cart of charcoal could fetch a good price, he would certainly bring back some treats for them, and the New Year goods wouldn’t be lacking.

In the distance, the outline of the county city’s high walls became visible. The man sighed in relief; the city was lively and bustling, warmer than outside. Once the two children were happy, they would likely forget about being cold.

However, the young man wearing a bamboo hat walked at a steady pace behind the ox cart, making the man a bit worried.

Chen Ping'an quickened his steps and asked with a smile, “Brother, I’m a traveler from afar and don’t know what this county city is called. Are there any places worth visiting?”

The man, a bit reserved, didn’t dare to feign ignorance. He forced a smile and replied hoarsely, “In response to your honor, it’s called Suijia City. I heard that many years ago, the emperor traveled south and accidentally caught a chill while staying here for a time. He then bestowed this name. I only know the City God Temple to the north and the Fire God Temple to the south; they are usually the most crowded. You could visit those places.”

“Great! Once I enter the city, I’ll check out those two locations,” Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, gently resting his hand on the ox cart. “Since we’re going the same way, I’m in no hurry. Let’s enter the city together, and I can ask you more about Suijia City.”

The man, feeling a bit anxious, nevertheless glanced up and saw the ox cart getting closer to the city gate. He felt reassured and tried to speak more like the townsfolk, saying pleasant things: “Then I’ll share what I know. If I can help you a little, that would be best. I’ve never studied, so if I say something wrong, please bear with me.”

Holding his walking staff in one hand and steadying the ox cart with the other, Chen Ping'an replied, “That’s good; just speak freely.”

Under the man’s rambling introduction, Chen Ping'an learned that Suijia City was in the Silver Screen Kingdom and wasn’t a small city. Historically, it had produced a prominent prime minister, so the City God Temple was bustling with incense offerings. The Fire God Temple was also lively, reputed to be quite effective for those seeking wealth. Wealthy merchants in the city loved to burn incense there. Thus, the man was pulling the ox cart toward the market near the Fire God Temple, intending to sell the charcoal and buy New Year goods from nearby shops.

The two children had been secretly observing Chen Ping'an. Whenever he smiled at them, they quickly turned their heads away, feeling embarrassed.

Before long, the ox cart reached the city gate. Since it was still early, a queue had formed to enter the city. Nearby, some breakfast stalls were set up. Chen Ping'an bought a bowl of millet porridge and a flatbread. He removed his bamboo hat and sat down at a table to eat. The two children, not far away, swallowed hard. The man hesitated for a moment, then pulled out a handful of coins to give to his daughter. With the money, the two children dashed toward the stall, buying a bowl of millet porridge and a fragrant flatbread. The daughter brought the flatbread back to her father. He took a bite and then tore the rest in half, giving it back to her. The little girl ran back to the table and handed half to her brother, and the siblings shared the bowl of porridge while the man watched over the ox cart, wiping his mouth and smiling broadly.

The stall was doing good business, and the two children sat directly opposite Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an was accustomed to chewing slowly while contemplating various matters.

His earlier trip to the Ghost Trick Valley, where he had schemed against a scholar and fought with the golden eagle of Jixiao Mountain, was not particularly perilous. 

However, the stretch between Tongshou City and Qinglu Town—or more accurately, the journey from the Pima Sect’s ferry to escaping the sky at Muyi Mountain—still sent shivers down Chen Ping'an’s spine. After replaying the chess games several times, he felt that his life had hung by a thread. Yet, thinking of the final harvest, which was bountiful, he had earned a fair amount of divine money and acquired many rare items; there was nothing to complain about. His only regret was that he hadn’t fought enough. The fights were rather lackluster, even less exciting than the sparring at the bamboo house in the Declining Mountain—he wanted more. If the monsters from Jixiao Mountain had teamed up with that Mountain-Relocating Sage, and if there hadn’t been a high-ranking spirit like Gao Cheng secretly coveting the north, perhaps the battles would have been more thrilling.

Later, while recuperating at the residence in Muyi Mountain, he learned of many fresh happenings in North Julu Continent from a stack of celestial reports that had been brought to him.

Among the most surprising was the news regarding Huang Ting, the female crown cultivator of Tai Ping Mountain, who had lost to a young talent named Liu Jinglong during a life-and-death battle at Zhilijiao Mountain. It was known that Huang Ting had come to North Julu Continent to break through the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul stage. Although she was a newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivator, her swordsmanship was undoubtedly exceptional. Yet, Liu Jinglong had two other young cultivators, both of whom were even more talented and well-connected, above him. As for the seven outstanding youths who followed Liu Jinglong, just considering the abilities and temperament of Yang Ningxing from Yunxiao Palace, Chen Ping'an did not dare to underestimate them.

In addition, Chen Ping'an was particularly curious about a place near Zhilijiao Mountain.

There was a mountain outside the mountain, and in the constantly battling Zhilijiao, nearby was Baquan Mountain, the best place to watch battles. The mountain was home to over a hundred spiritual springs, abundant in spiritual energy, a prime location for cultivation. Over a thousand celestial residences were built on the mountain, surrounded by beautiful landscapes, making it an excellent place for cultivation. These residences on Baquan Mountain were for rent only, constructed meticulously by skilled artisans hired by Qionglin Sect, with rental prices rising the longer one stayed.

Through this lucrative business, the Qionglin Sect managed to produce a mediocre offering in the Yupu realm, enabling them to acquire a sect suffix.

This sect had a poor reputation in North Julu Continent, as they only cared about money and never made friends, but this did not hinder their ability to make money hand over fist.

Thus, the Qionglin Sect was both envied and despised by cultivators on the mountain, leading to a popular saying: "A five-realm scholar on a flowery pillow, two sleeves of clear wind at Qionglin Sect."

Chen Ping'an set down his chopsticks and looked toward the city gate. In the distance, the sound of galloping hooves echoed, thundering against the ground. It must have been a procession of eight tall horses leaving the city. As they neared the bustling city gate, the riders did not slow down; instead, they spurred their horses, causing a ruckus at the gate, making the populace scatter to the walls to avoid them. The common folk outside seemed unfazed, experienced in such matters, and quickly cleared the road, including the ox cart, creating a wide, empty path.

This was a common sight, wherever one went.

Those dandy young masters, riding high on their horses, galloped out of the city. The rapid hoofbeats sounded like firecrackers, and the haughty aristocratic youths expertly maneuvered their steeds, all clad in expensive fur coats, wielding ornate riding whips, and accompanied by strong servants carrying hawks in cages—a splendid display of speed and power.

However, Chen Ping'an’s attention was drawn more to two young people sitting at a nearby stall, a man and a woman, dressed simply yet neatly, both carrying long swords. Their appearances were unremarkable, but they exuded a certain poise. They were each eating a bowl of wontons, their expressions indifferent. When the man noticed the galloping young masters, he frowned, while the woman set down her chopsticks and gently shook her head at him.

Chen Ping'an understood.

They were likely cultivators drawn to the unusual happenings in Suijia City.

However, the young man and woman had low cultivations. Observing the subtle signs of their spiritual energy flow, Chen Ping'an deduced that they were still Qi practitioners, not sword cultivators despite their swords.

When the sword-carrying woman turned to look, she merely saw a young man settling his bill with the stall owner, holding a bamboo staff and wearing a bamboo hat. The man seemed ordinary and unremarkable, akin to any wandering hero. The woman sighed, noting that if this young man were inadvertently caught up in the troubles of Suijia City, his luck would be poor. If he was like them, drawn here by the impending disaster and the emergence of a rare artifact, it would be sheer folly. Did he not know that the artifact had already been predetermined by the two major sects with the deepest foundations across many nations? Apart from some reckless wild cultivators, who would dare interfere? For her and her companion, aside from fulfilling their sect’s secret mission, it was more like a perilous trial.

This was a genuine battle between immortals. If an ordinary scholar were to get involved, one misstep could block the path of a deity, leading to a grim fate.

The woman’s thoughts wandered.

She considered herself one of the top young cultivators among the youth of the Silver Screen Kingdom and surrounding nations, but she knew she fell far short compared to those two. One was merely fifteen years old and had already reached the cave dwelling stage two years prior, while the other was in her early twenties, blessed with opportunities and a smooth cultivation journey, possessing significant treasures. If it weren’t for the fierce rivalry between their two top sects, they would have been a perfect match.

The growth and rivalry of those two were likely being watched by all in the realm.

Every encounter between them would become a tale worth recounting.

She was envious.

Because that precocious boy, destined for greatness from birth, had an appearance that resembled an immortal. He was gentle in temperament and excelled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. She couldn’t fathom how someone so enchanting could exist in the world, making women forget their mundane lives.

Seeing her lost in thought, the young man thought she was worried about their upcoming journey and comforted her, saying, “Sister, if we don’t have confidence, we should find that child and leave. There’s no need to concern ourselves with this unavoidable disaster. Master said that as cultivators, we must understand the heavenly mandate and follow circumstances. Since Suijia City has enjoyed the blessings of divine protection for hundreds of years, it must face this destined calamity.”

The woman nodded and reminded him, “Be careful; the walls have ears.”

The young man laughed, “If it’s true that the city is full of dragons and fish, with extraordinary people gathering, I believe it. But to say we might encounter a hidden master at the city gate… I don’t buy it. We are no mere small sects; the old gods and young sages on the mountain are all familiar faces. Can that man juggling monkeys be a hidden master? Or that young wanderer with the bamboo hat be a grand master of the martial world?”

The woman’s expression changed slightly. “Have you forgotten the teachings of our sect? When traveling down the mountain, we must be cautious in our words and actions!”

While she admonished him, her gaze quickly swept over the old man with the monkey on his shoulder and the young man who had approached the ox cart. Her heart jolted. The latter remained oblivious to her disciple’s provocative words, but the old man, who had been feeding the monkey, turned to look at her with a smirk, his expression unfriendly. The woman stood up and cupped her fists in apology.

The old man, however, seemed unappreciative, his gaze wandering as he scrutinized her from head to toe, then smirked coldly, no longer looking at her, seemingly disdainful of her appearance.

The woman didn’t mind too much, but her younger companion was infuriated, nearly bursting with rage at the old man’s rudeness. He was about to step forward, but the sister lightly tugged at his sleeve, shaking her head. “It was our rudeness first.”

The young man glared fiercely at the old man, memorizing his face. When they entered Suijia City, the race for treasures would begin; with all the factions entangled, chaos would surely ensue. If an opportunity arose, he would make that old man pay dearly.

Chen Ping'an observed all of this, feeling somewhat emotional about the inexplicable animosity between the two parties, whose tempers were clearly not very good.

In truth, the Silver Screen Kingdom and the surrounding ten or so nations were places where the spiritual energy was thin and unfriendly to cultivation, rife with wandering martial artists. Song Lanqiao from the Spring Dew Ferry had described the Qi practitioners here as frogs at the bottom of a well, content to lounge in their little puddles, while the true enlightened cultivators outside did not care for petty gains. The local practitioners were quite happy to avoid the troubles caused by outsiders, enjoying their dominion over their little realm, while two rival sects, both with poor standards, had been fighting each other for hundreds of years.

Yet, despite Song Lanqiao’s casual tone, Chen Ping'an was accustomed to being cautious in the martial world, always steering clear of danger.

With countless strange techniques among mountain cultivators, once they fought, the disparity in realms and the quality of their artifacts became uncertain. The interplay of the five elements, timing, and luck, along with schemes, were all variables.

Once inside the city, to avoid the charcoal seller mistaking his intentions, Chen Ping'an chose not to accompany him to the Fire God Temple market but instead headed directly to the City God Temple.

He could tell that the man was a straightforward warrior, likely at the peak of the third realm. Upon seeing Chen Ping'an, the man intentionally muddied his breath and lightened his steps. It was likely that a decent warrior at the peak of the third realm would have some reputation in the Silver Screen Kingdom. As for why he had become a humble charcoal seller, toiling for a meager living with a family, he likely had his own story. Chen Ping'an wasn’t inclined to pry; one could not know the joys of fish if they were not fish.

After their paths diverged, the man led the ox cart, while the two children remained carefree, looking around. The man smiled, glancing back at the young wanderer’s retreating figure, muttering to himself, “Even I couldn’t tell he was a wanderer. He must be a second or third realm youth. Sigh, why did he step into this murky water? Those immortals who cultivated on the mountains are like dragons; a simple flick of their tails could drown countless common folk.”

Meanwhile, Chen Ping'an smiled. 

The man was kind-hearted, intentionally mentioning that the nearby Lingbao City had many more places worth visiting. It seemed he wanted to encourage Chen Ping'an to leave Suijia City, a place of troubles, sooner rather than later.

Coincidentally, the old man with the monkey and the young sword-bearing couple were also headed to the City God Temple, just like Chen Ping'an.

Thus, Chen Ping'an deliberately slowed his pace, distancing himself from them. He paused at a nearby calligraphy shop, browsing through some paintings. He didn’t buy any, but he spent a few coins on some booklets originally meant as promotional gifts, which introduced the famous works of various artists from the Silver Screen Kingdom. The printed editions were decent but not exceptional; the content was simply enjoyable.

After putting the booklets in his bamboo box and leaving the shop, he noticed that the old man and the couple had vanished from sight.

Approaching the City God Temple, Chen Ping'an’s expression turned serious. The incense wafted through the air, and he could smell its unique fragrance even from the street outside the temple. However, the more temples he visited, the more he understood that the quantity and quality of incense didn’t matter as much as its purity. Regardless of whether it was a court-sanctioned temple or a sham temple built by local folk or spirits, the essence of the incense had to nourish the surrounding environment to benefit the people. This was how a cycle was formed. Yet, the City God Temple before him was so tightly controlled that not a single drop of essence leaked, which was a deviation from tradition. All official temples, including those dedicated to mountain and water deities, as well as civil and martial deities, should contribute part of their essence back to the land to nurture the people; otherwise, it would lead to disaster.

Chen Ping'an sighed lightly. He could understand that this was a desperate move by the deity’s golden body to prolong its existence, akin to drinking poison to quench thirst. Over time, such actions would only accumulate trouble.

Understanding the connections between people and events in the world does not imply agreement.

Chen Ping'an did not enter the City God Temple, for the charcoal seller, despite his intention to conceal his skills, likely had been there to pray sincerely. Thus, he didn’t dare to speak carelessly. From what he had gathered about the deities worshipped in the front and back halls, he understood that the Suijia City City God Temple followed similar regulations as other places. In addition to the front and back halls and the impressive Kuixing Tower, there were also halls dedicated to the local customs, like the Wealth God Hall and the Yuancheng Hall.

However, Chen Ping'an still inquired in detail with the old shopkeeper at the incense shop outside the temple. The shopkeeper was friendly and talkative, sharing the temple's history. It turned out that the front hall worshipped an ancient general from a millennium ago, a historical figure from a notable dynasty. The true “overseer of fortunes and disasters, inspector of the underworld, and ruler of lost souls” was honored in the back hall, a well-known civil minister who had been bestowed the title of a third-rank marquis by the emperor of the Silver Screen Kingdom.

When discussing this decree, the shopkeeper smiled and asked, “Young man, are you puzzled as to why he is merely a third-rank marquis? This civil official was once a second-rank minister in his lifetime.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “It is a bit strange. I was just thinking of asking the shopkeeper about it. Is there an explanation?”

If one were to say that the rules of the many temples in the world were intricate, Chen Ping'an was already quite knowledgeable. However, to blend in with local customs, one must first inquire about them.

The shopkeeper laughed without explaining further.

Chen Ping'an quickly bought a tube of incense from the incense shop.

He ascended the steps.

The shopkeeper laughed heartily, finally beginning to explain the nuances, “Young man, you look like someone who mingles in the martial world, so it’s normal that you’re unfamiliar with the intricacies of the officialdom. The ranks of nobility and official positions aren’t quite the same, not to mention the ranks of the deities worshiped here, which vary even more. Are you confused?”

Chen Ping'an nodded and chuckled, “It is indeed a bit complex.”

The shopkeeper began to display his knowledge, shaking his head and saying, “Our City God was initially granted the rank of a fourth-rank marquis by the founding emperor. However, due to the temple's consistent effectiveness in granting wishes, the new emperor issued a decree a few years ago, promoting our City God to the rank of a third-rank marquis. It was quite the grand affair; the Minister of Rites personally traveled from the capital with the order. On that day, early before dawn, a large group of constables came to wash the street outside the shop, forbidding outsiders from watching. I wanted to see the excitement, so I slept in the shop the night before and was fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the minister. Tsk tsk, he truly lived up to his reputation as the star of literature; even from a distance, he exuded a noble air.”

The shopkeeper beamed with pride, “Even though this is just a county city, the treatment of our City God is already comparable to that of a city god in a state capital. Apart from the capital and the secondary capital, there is no higher decree.”

“Therefore, young man, if you offer incense, be sure to pray sincerely, bow more, and knock your head often. Although this City God Temple has historically been more effective for scholars seeking literary success, our City God holds a high position and possesses great abilities. If you are sincere, you may receive protection.”

Chen Ping'an asked about the civil and military officials in the City God Temple, and indeed, there were two judges, six officials of the City God, two roaming deities, and a general with shackles assisting the City God. The shopkeeper was quite familiar with these assistants’ backgrounds, explaining them in detail. However, when Chen Ping'an inquired if he had ever seen the City God manifest, the shopkeeper fell silent, his expression slightly awkward. He replied, “We common folk can’t possibly see the true form of the City God. Even if he stood right in front of us, we wouldn’t recognize him.”

Chen Ping'an smiled. “That’s how it should be. It is said that the true immortals do not reveal themselves, and those who reveal themselves are not true immortals. I assume these deities are the same.”

The shopkeeper’s expression brightened.

The rituals of the Silver Screen Kingdom’s City God were generally similar to those of Baoping Continent, but there were still some differences, particularly concerning ranks and assistant deities.

However, the matter of the current emperor’s posthumous promotion was unusual; it seemed he had recognized something extraordinary about the golden body of the City God here, warranting the elevation of a county city’s City God to a higher rank.

After leaving the incense shop, Chen Ping'an stood on the bustling street, glancing at the City God Temple.

Better to sleep in a grave than in a dilapidated temple.

Such was the reason.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 584: Some Principles Are Self-Evident (Part Two)

Once the spiritual energy of the mountains and waters in the world shifts, it can easily lead to a reversal of fortune and calamity.

Chen Ping’an made his way towards the Fire God Temple. The City God Temple showed no signs of crumbling just yet, so it should remain stable for some time to come. The Fire God Temple was also bustling with incense offerings, but compared to the chaotic scenes at the City God Temple, this place was much more orderly and serene.

However, he hesitated to step inside. Currently, he could suppress the strange happenings around him with his fist intent, but once he entered the temple, he could attract unwanted attention. Chen Ping’an wasn't sure; if it weren’t for how rushed his trip to the southeastern part of North Julu was, he would have preferred to visit several major temples of the secular dynasty after finishing his visit to the Swaying River Temple. He wanted to investigate personally. After all, the Swaying River Temple was overseen by a mountain deity who lived next door to the Pima Sect, which had a high perspective on things. When he came to offer incense, they might not take him seriously. Whether they noticed him or not wouldn’t mean much. That said, the greatest river deity at the southern tip of the continent hadn’t shown up at the temple but had played the role of a supportive ferryman, seemingly wanting to help him out.

Chen Ping’an wandered around the incense shop near the Fire God Temple, inquiring about the origins of that deity. 

There was one similarity between this deity and the old shopkeeper at the City God Temple; this deity, who presided over the southern part of the city, also had never truly made an appearance in the marketplace. The legends and tales surrounding him were even more numerous than those about the City God in the north. Moreover, he seemed to be closer to the common people, often involved in tales of rewarding good and punishing evil, mingling with the human world. The history was long, passed down through generations, which is why it had survived in the mouths of later generations. One such tale mentioned that this Fire God had a past dispute with a Lake Lord from the distant Cangjun Lake, which was eight hundred miles away. The trouble started because a lady from a Water Immortal Temple in that jurisdiction had angered the Fire God, leading to a massive fight. The Lake Lord, not being a match for the Fire God, sought help, but ultimately, it was an unnamed wandering swordsman who mediated the two deities, preventing the Lake Lord from unleashing his powers and flooding the city.

After thinking it over, Chen Ping’an decided to leave Suijia City and chose a small mountain path leading secretly towards the Water Immortal Temple in the Cangjun Lake jurisdiction. If that self-styled "canal master," whose rank was equivalent to that of a river goddess, was still around, he could take a roundabout approach to learn about the inner workings of Suijia City. If it was truly a calamity affecting an entire city, he would need to intervene. If it was just a conflict between lesser deities, he could decide what to do later.

As night fell, Chen Ping’an walked along a wide stream and came upon a temple. The path was overgrown with weeds, and signs of human presence were rare, indicating that the offerings to the canal master’s lady had dwindled.

This temple was only a few dozen miles from the nearby town. However, earlier at the confluence of the stream and lake, he had seen a group of people carrying torches heading towards the temple.

Chen Ping’an followed them, listening to their conversations with a mix of amusement and disbelief. It seemed these youngsters from the marketplace were competing to see who had the most courage to enter the temple and tease the canal master’s lady. Such antics were quite common in rural areas. Back in his hometown, there were stories of kids who dared to sleep on the grave of a deity. That would make them local heroes. There had been a peer in Xinghua Alley who claimed he had slept on a deity’s grave for a night, and when he boasted about it under an old locust tree, he garnered admiration from many other kids, becoming something of a leader among them. After that, he took pleasure in bullying Chen Ping’an and Song Jixin, the neighbors from Niping Alley, and had even wanted to make a girl named Zhigui pretend to be his little wife during their playtime. Unfortunately, he was met with a harsh scolding from Song Jixin, while Zhigui, with her cold, indifferent demeanor, ran back to the town with Song Jixin, leaving that peer to hurl mud at them.

In reality, that very night, Chen Ping’an happened to be at the temple praying to the Bodhisattva, and from a distance, he saw that peer, who had only wandered a few steps outside the deity's grave before rushing home.

Tonight, as Chen Ping’an observed the group of seven or eight, they had brought plenty of food and drink with them. Once they entered the small Water Immortal Temple, which had only two courtyards, the plaque was askew, and the interior had long been abandoned, in disrepair, with green vines crawling over the walls, Chen Ping’an chose a large tree a distance away to sit on, his view unobstructed. He placed his hiking staff across his knees, with both hands tucked into his sleeves, gazing quietly at the unfolding scene.

He took out some rations and retrieved a bottle from his sword sheath filled with the deep, shadowy water from the Baijing Mountain, starting to enjoy a late-night snack. After all, this journey had been anything but leisurely.

Inside the small temple, several bonfires had been lit, and the atmosphere was lively, with drinking and eating. The conversations were quite risqué.

There were three statues—one tall and two shorter—intended to be colorful divine figures. However, time had been merciless, and the paint had chipped away. The central figure was the canal master’s lady, with two handmaidens flanking her. 

All three figures retained an air of life, especially the canal master, whose slender figure adorned with jewelry looked particularly beautiful.

Chen Ping’an cast a glance and found it strange; these three statues didn’t seem capable of containing divine light.

This was indeed a stroke of luck for those unruly youths. 

After finishing his rations, Chen Ping’an planned to visit Cangjun Lake. However, since the Lake Lord had no temple on the shore, he felt a bit of a headache. If it came to it, he might have to reveal himself and ask those audacious fellows if there were any other water deity temples nearby.

As he began to close his eyes to conserve his energy, he started to refine the shadowy waters from Baijing Mountain.

At the same time, he gradually immersed his mind using the internal vision method he had learned, allowing his spirit to roam in his little world.

Some ancient texts recorded content that could easily confuse later generations flipping through the pages. 

For instance, why was it a white horse that was sacrificed to the River God? The texts never provided an explanation. 

As for the phrase about the River God not being seen, waiting for big fish and dragons, it was even more perplexing. Across the vast world, mountain and river deities and their temple statutes were never rare.

Chen Ping’an suddenly opened his eyes, instantly retracting all his energy, remaining still and silent.

His gaze turned towards the distant confluence of the stream flowing into the lake, where he noticed a subtle ripple causing changes in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Soon after, he saw the water's surface shimmering, revealing three figures, two of whom followed behind the first—a woman dressed in colorful garments, her clothes billowing, surrounded by mist. The two maidens behind her resembled the ones from the Water Immortal Temple, but they were even more beautiful than the statues. The canal master’s lady, however, seemed far less attractive than the statue portrayed. One could only wonder what the skilled artisan who crafted the statues thought every time they chiseled away.

Switching his gaze, Chen Ping’an began to admire the audacity of the group inside the temple. One of the youths had climbed onto the divine platform, hugging the canal master’s statue and gnawing on it, his mouth full of lewd remarks, prompting roars of laughter from the others.

In youth, such behavior was often seen as a mark of bravery. 

And when one met a girl they secretly liked, teasing her a bit, getting scolded in return, and rolling their eyes at each other, they would count that as mutual affection.

As the three women approached the temple, they cast an illusion, transforming into an old woman with white hair and two charming young maidens.

The old woman wore a cold smile. Upon entering the temple, she adopted a benevolent demeanor.

The youths and young men, witnessing the elderly woman and the two vibrant maidens, were momentarily stunned into silence.

The temple was suddenly deathly quiet, except for the occasional crackle of the burning firewood.

Especially the boy who had been clinging to the canal master’s statue; he turned around, looking bewildered.

One of the boys nudged the young man beside him with his elbow, his voice trembling, “Could it be that the Water Goddess has come to punish us?”

The young man shook his head, his shock shifting to delight, and grinned, “Just look closely; she’s nothing more than an old hag wandering the night with two granddaughters, probably from a nearby village we don’t know. We’re quite lucky, huh?”

The boy discreetly wiped the grease from his mouth, worried that the young man might take it too far after drinking, and cautiously advised, “Bro, let’s not be impulsive. If this escalates, we could land ourselves in serious trouble.”

The young man let out a scoff. “Trouble? The bigger the ruckus, the better! We’ll make a bride out of her, and nobody’s taking her from me. I’ll just take the one on the left, and you guys can negotiate for the one on the right.”

The old woman feigned panic, attempting to lead the two young maidens away, but had already been surrounded by the young men.

The boldest one, who had jumped onto the divine platform, had already slipped off the canal master’s statue, hands on his hips, watching the scene at the entrance with a smirk, “Looks like that guy with the sword wasn’t wrong. My luck with women is peaking! Liu San, you take one, and I’ll take the other!”

Chen Ping’an furrowed his brow.

He looked towards a beam in the temple.

On it sat a burly man with thick eyebrows, a sword hanging at his waist. He yawned lazily, pulling off a yellow paper talisman from his body. As the talisman was torn away, it burst into flames.

The old woman was taken aback.

The man smiled, “You can’t catch fish without bait.”

He stretched his limbs, and with a flick of his sleeve, a stream of spiritual energy slithered around the walls. With a snap of his fingers, golden light talismans appeared on the walls inside and outside the temple, their designs resembling flying birds.

Before those foolish youths arrived, he had already infiltrated the Water Immortal Temple, drawing talismans and using a unique secret technique, akin to a turtle's breath concealment method, allowing him to cloak his own energy. Otherwise, the canal master’s lady would have fled.

As for the binding talismans, they were a renowned technique of his sect, known as the Snow Mud Talismans, also called the Flying Bird Seal. Once completed, they were exceptionally discreet and hard to detect, akin to a great bird stepping on snow, leaving only traces behind as it flew away.

However, aside from this remarkable talisman technique, his sect was also a formidable martial arts faction, adept in assassination, which set them apart from common martial arts powers. Thus, his fellow disciples often served as close bodyguards to the officials of secular dynasties. Although his sect wasn’t the top-tier celestial force across the dozens of nations, no one dared to underestimate them. He, however, had a wild disposition, unwilling to be restrained, and spent decades roaming the lower realms, preferring to toy with those who were like mudfish in water or earthworms in the mountains, with life and death in his hands—quite enjoyable, especially with those so-called female heroes.

At that moment, he regarded the old woman and the two maidens as if they were already in his pocket.

The old woman slowly asked, “Might I inquire why you, esteemed immortal, have schemed to lure me out of the lake? This behavior in my home is quite inappropriate, wouldn’t you agree?”

The man reached over, grabbed a wine flask from beside the bonfire, took a huge gulp, and then tossed it aside in disgust. “What kind of rubbish did these little brats buy? Smells like urine. No wonder they’re so dim-witted.”

He seemed to be in a bad mood, glaring at the old woman. “My junior brother has a grudge against your Lake Lord. As I’m here on orders from my master to visit Suijia City, I know you’re a restless widow. The grudge between my foolish junior brother and Cangjun Lake originated with you. So, you’re my sacrificial offering. If the Lake Lord comes, that would be just fine. As long as he comes ashore, I won’t be afraid of him at all. Isn’t it said that the canal master’s lady is his favorite? Once I toy with you to death and toss your corpse by Cangjun Lake, let’s see if he can endure it.”

The old woman’s face turned ashen.

The two maidens appeared pitiful, their spiritual energy dissipating, showing their true forms vaguely.

The unruly youths were all terrified, their faces pale.

Especially the young man standing on the divine platform, who needed to lean against the statue to keep from collapsing.

Although Chen Ping’an didn’t know how the man managed to conceal his energy so effectively, one thing was clear: none of the three parties in this temple were good people.

The one remaining by the bonfire still retained some conscience, but at that moment, he was already trembling and close to urinating his pants.

The old woman decided to drop her illusion, forcing a smile, “Esteemed immortal, you must be from the Ghostly Hammer Palace of the Golden Bell Kingdom, right?”

The man was taken aback for a moment before cursing loudly, “Damn it! With your looks, you think my junior brother has been longing for you all these years? I once took him around the lower realms to lift his spirits, and I tasted many noblewomen and beautiful female heroes, but he always found them dull. Is it your bed skills that have held his heart?”

From his perch on the branch, Chen Ping’an squinted.

The canal master’s lady’s face darkened, but she still spoke sweetly, “Back in the day, my feelings with your junior brother were mutual. We wanted nothing more than to be a pair of unruly immortal lovers. However, that wretched maid from the Zao Creek Canal reported us to the Lake Lord. I tried to persuade him, but he insisted on taking action, resulting in this misunderstanding. Esteemed immortal, I hope you can see this clearly.”

Seeing the man on the beam grip his sword, ready to take action, she pulled one of the maidens forward, smiling sweetly, “Esteemed immortal, my two maidens look quite charming. I’d like to offer them to you as bedwarmers, but I hope you will show some mercy and return them to Cangjun Lake when you tire of them next year.”

The man asked, “And what about you?”

The canal master’s lady smiled, “If you find me to your liking, I wouldn’t mind serving you in your bed as well.”

The man remained noncommittal, raising his chin slightly. “What about these unruly fellows?”

The canal master’s lady smiled sweetly, “They’ve offended the deities and deserve death. If they offend your eyes, then they’re even more deserving of it. I can take care of these rascals right away. I have a sparkling cup hidden in my sleeve, made from the essence of Cangjun Lake water. This is just the opportunity to invite you to drink. I’ll personally pour for you, and these two maidens are former palace dancers. Once they remove their clothing, they’ll dance to entertain you.”

The man continued to smile, remaining silent.

This only made the canal master’s lady feel increasingly anxious.

In an instant, the man unexpectedly slashed his sword down.

The canal master’s lady recoiled in fright, but fortunately, the sword light didn’t aim for her head; it shot outside the temple.

The canal master’s lady turned pale, glancing back.

She saw a large tree illuminated by the sword light, where a young wanderer wearing a hat slightly raised his head. One hand remained tucked in his sleeve, while the other grasped the sword light, creating a clash with the energy emanating from his palm, presenting an image of a deity holding a shining moon.

The man was startled but maintained his composure, shifting from a seated position to crouching on the beam, his sword gleaming bright. He clicked his tongue in admiration, “Oh, what remarkable skill! The purity of your energy is unparalleled, and your technique is flawless. When did the Silver Screen Kingdom give birth to such a young martial master? I’ve dealt with the top martial artist of the Silver Screen Kingdom before, and while I could withstand that sword, I could never do it as effortlessly as you.”

Chen Ping’an gently retracted his palm, letting the last vestiges of sword light dissipate. “Are the talismans you used earlier, as well as the ones drawn on the walls, secret teachings of your sect? Only practitioners of Ghostly Hammer Palace would use them?”

The man laughed, “I just borrowed a light sword strike to greet you. Do you think you can act all high and mighty with me?”

He leaped down from the beam and strode towards the temple entrance, causing the canal master’s lady, the two maidens, and the already scattered youths to quickly step back.

With his sword resting on the ground, he sneered, “Quickly tell me your name! If you’re someone familiar with our Ghostly Hammer Palace, then you’re a friend, and friends can share blessings. If you plan to play the role of a noble hero tonight, then I, Du Yu, will have to teach you a lesson.”

The young men felt their hearts pound with fear at the words of this immortal.

However, the canal master’s lady was quite surprised; Du’s words held significant depth. He didn’t show any signs of weakness, but his tone was far from arrogant.

What shocked her even more was that the young wanderer vanished like a wisp of smoke, appearing outside the temple door, smiling, “Then I ask you to teach me how to be a person.”

Du Yu rested his hand on the sword hilt, his expression grim as he twisted his fist, “Are we determining who’s superior or directly deciding life and death?!”

The wanderer replied, “You didn’t kill me; you’ve almost scared me to death.”

The canal master’s lady couldn’t help but stifle a laugh, otherwise, she would have burst into laughter.

In a flash, the canal master’s lady’s thoughts raced. She took a step back, “Du Yu, Du Yu of the Ghostly Hammer Palace! You’re the son of those celestial lovers from the Golden Bell Kingdom?!”

Du Yu smirked; she was quite perceptive, and this woman could live.

However, the wanderer added, “How great are these celestial lovers? Are they both at the Fifth Realm?”

The canal master’s lady’s heart leaped with joy, realizing she had struck gold! By bringing up Du Yu’s notable identity, it seemed the wanderer was still unafraid. It appeared that tonight, at the very least, the situation would tilt in her favor. If they ended up mutually destroying each other, that would be ideal. If the newcomer, who had appeared out of nowhere, triumphed, it would be even better. Dealing with an unprovoked wanderer would be much easier than facing off against Du Yu, who was directly targeting her. Even if Du Yu turned that useless young wanderer into a puddle of flesh, he should still remember their previous connection. After all, Du Yu didn’t seem inclined to kill; otherwise, based on the notorious temperament of the Ghostly Hammer Palace, he would have already drawn his sword and attacked.

Du Yu beckoned, raising his sword, casually waving, “As long as you can break through the talisman array and enter this temple, I’ll allow you one strike.”

In an instant, the walls of the temple lit up with golden light, dazzling those present.

Then, the young wanderer wearing a hat reappeared beside Du Yu, sweeping his arm across the latter’s neck, causing Du Yu to be knocked unconscious with a single blow, crashing heavily against the divine platform. Not only did he break the statue of the canal master’s lady in two, but Du Yu was also embedded into the wall, with his sword clattering to the ground.

The sword light shimmered like water, clearly a fine blade.

Chen Ping’an, holding his hiking staff, stood in place. This modified Iron Cavalry Array technique, paired with a talisman drawn after entering the temple, had been executed with restraint; otherwise, the person who had dared to let him make a move would have become an unfilial son, leaving behind a white-haired parent mourning a black-haired child. Of course, with mountain cultivators, it wasn’t surprising for them to look youthful even at a hundred or a thousand years old.

The reason for his restraint was that Chen Ping’an wanted to “humbly consult” the young wanderer about those unique talismans.

As for the panicking youths, the pulse of energy released from his fist knocked them unconscious.

The frivolous young man on the divine platform was also knocked out when he collided with the flying Du Yu, but his fate was far worse than that of the men in the courtyard.

Everything had been calculated to perfection.

Yet, only one boy remained, sitting dazed by the bonfire.

Chen Ping’an glanced at him. “Don’t you know how to play dead?”

The boy quickly fell back, tilting his head, rolling his eyes, and sticking out his tongue.

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Canal master’s lady, I hope you don’t mind that I broke your statue.”

As he spoke, he waved his sleeve, sending one of the young men crashing against the wall with a resounding thud, followed by a faint sound of bones breaking.

The canal master, who governed the local waterways, felt as if all his bones were shattering.

The canal master’s lady quickly stammered, “It’s not a big deal, not a big deal! As long as the esteemed immortal is pleased, even if it’s shattered into pieces, it doesn’t matter.”

Chen Ping’an inquired, “What’s going on with Suijia City?”

The canal master’s lady slightly bent forward, holding up a glowing celestial artifact, “Esteemed immortal, you can drink as I slowly explain.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “That tactic won’t work with that fellow Du; do you really think it’ll do any good? And why does your canal master’s young brother keep thinking about you? Don’t you have any idea? If you’re truly seeking death, you should find a smarter way to go about it. Do you really think I’m so naive, just because my martial arts are low and I lack experience?”

The canal master’s lady hurriedly put away the wine cup, but a chill surged at the top of her head, followed by a pain that pierced her heart. She felt herself slapped down to her knees, her spirit swaying as if she were submerged in boiling oil. The canal master’s lady gritted her teeth, trembling, her speech even more stammering, “Esteemed immortal, have mercy! I won’t dare to seek death again!”

Chen Ping’an waved his hand, “I’m not Du; I have no enmity with you or Cangjun Lake. I’m merely passing through. If it weren’t for Du insisting on a strike, I wouldn’t have entered. Speak plainly about what you know regarding the inner workings of Suijia City. If I find out you’re pretending not to know something that I’m aware of, then we’ll need to discuss it properly. That sparkling cup you’ve hidden in your sleeve is meant to carry something akin to a soul-stealing potion or a love charm, isn’t it?”

The canal master’s lady laughed, but it was more painful than crying.

This fellow was clearly a hundred times more troublesome than Du!

Trembling, the canal master’s lady recounted the troubles plaguing Suijia City.

As she spoke, Chen Ping’an kept a discreet eye on the expressions of the two maidens.

It turned out that the City God in Suijia City was indeed on the verge of his divine body crumbling, reaching the end of the incense offerings. What was referred to as being at the end of one’s road was nothing more than that. However, like that man, the City God was also afraid of death. He had exhausted all means, first establishing connections, depleting his savings, and requesting a decree from the court that exceeded the usual rites, yet the effects were still poor. This stemmed from an event that had been overlooked at the time but had far-reaching consequences—an unjust case from a century ago, where an entire family of scholars was wrongfully killed. In the eyes of both the officials and common folk, it was considered avenged. However, the truth was far from it. The officials of the City God Temple had been unaware of the severe repercussions; otherwise, the scene would have looked quite different.

Cangjun Lake and Suijia City were neighbors, and the Lake Lord, who governed a lake, three rivers, and two canals, was deeply entrenched in the area and thus privy to many inner secrets. The family of scholars had been known for their good deeds for generations, with their family plaque almost nurturing a little spirit of incense, only to suffer a calamity overnight, leaving nothing behind. The City God was furious and ordered the officials to investigate the matter. To his surprise, the investigation led back to the City God Temple itself. It turned out that the head of the Yin-Yang Division, one of the six officials of the temple, had conspired with a general who was supposed to maintain order, turning into a handsome young man to seduce and bully the women of that family. Meanwhile, the general had his eyes set on the not yet fully formed spirit of incense, hoping to use it as a bribe for a celestial cultivator, trying to ascend to the position of a martial judge in the city’s court. This general colluded with the Yin-Yang Division official, both of whom were supposed to aid the City God in ensuring peace in the region, hiring a group of wandering bandits to enter the city and wipe out the scholar family. The Yin-Yang Division official had early on hidden two beautiful women in a secluded residence outside the county town.

If it had ended there, the City God, even if slightly biased, wouldn’t have fallen to such a state today. That City God, who had always been good at flaunting his name, publicly ordered the ghost officials to hunt down the bandits and execute them on the spot without leaving a single survivor. Yet, secretly, he let the Yin-Yang official go free, killing the treacherous general. As for the two women, they naturally couldn’t escape death. However, unbeknownst to everyone, one child from that scholar family had been playing hide-and-seek with a maid and had hidden in a wall. The maid, loyal to her master, died nearby to shield the entrance with her body, allowing the child to escape. Years later, with the help of a family acquaintance, he changed his name and registered with the government, eventually becoming a successful official. He began to investigate the case, following the trail back to the City God Temple, which inevitably led to another bloodbath. But compared to the infamous incident a century ago, this time, everything was done quietly, and the court merely heard the news that a loyal county magistrate had died in office.

That scholar, who should have had a bright future, had never married nor had any servants by his side. He was all alone when he took office and met his demise in obscurity. It seemed he had already sensed the dangers in the city, and just before he sent a secret letter to a friend in the court, he had already resigned himself to death. On that fateful day, he visited the dilapidated mansion, stripped off his official robes, donned mourning attire, offered incense, and bowed in prayer, then… he died.

In fact, before he stepped out of the magistrate’s office, the ghost officials of the City God Temple had surrounded the entire office, with spirits roaming day and night acting as gatekeepers. Inside the office, both civil and military judges were waiting to pounce.

So that deep night, as he walked from the magistrate’s office to the old mansion, there were no passersby on the road, not even a single night watchman.

Three years after the City God of Suijia City had eradicated all potential threats, he found cracks beginning to appear in his divine body.

All the accumulated good deeds were unable to mend this crack, and he could only watch helplessly as it spread.

Thus, the anomalies in Suijia City began to manifest.

Chen Ping’an listened quietly, and then the canal master’s lady, in a tone tinged with schadenfreude, delivered a final verdict on the City God Temple of Suijia City, “It’s a case of self-inflicted suffering, but they are all too familiar with that phrase. It’s truly amusing; the City God Temple has a stone abacus on display, meant to remind people that ‘what a person does, the deities will calculate.’”

Chen Ping’an finally spoke, “That letter sent to the capital—did they intercept it at the City God Temple?”

The canal master’s lady shook her head, “According to what my lake lord said, that magistrate acted quite meticulously. He indeed sent it to a friend in the capital, but for some reason, it vanished without a trace. Over the years, the court has been completely unaware of this matter. Meanwhile, the recipient of the letter has had a smooth career, having risen to the position of Minister of Justice, and later his family prospered, with six successful candidates in the imperial examinations. The current head of the family is also a prominent official in the region.”

Chen Ping’an then asked, “Along with this Du, so many cultivators are rushing to Suijia City. Why is that? Could it be that the City God of Suijia City, so noble and honorable, has made friends with so many mountain dwellers, hoping to lend a hand to the City God Temple?”

The canal master’s lady, who had been quiet all along, lowered her voice and responded, “Suijia City’s feng shui is quite strange. Ever since the City God Temple experienced turmoil, it seems no rare treasures can remain. Every time there’s a full moon, heavy rain, or a snowy night, a treasure light shoots up from a prison within the county, soaring into the sky. Over the years, many high-level cultivators have come to investigate, but none have managed to grasp the source of that treasure. However, some geomancers speculate it’s a treasure nurtured by the spiritual energy of the mountains and rivers for thousands of years. With the grievances and malice surrounding Suijia City, it has grown restless and unwilling to remain, giving rise to signs of a great treasure appearing.”

Chen Ping’an squinted and asked, “I merely asked you, canal master’s lady, and learned so many startling truths. Yet, with so many capable individuals flying in and out of Suijia City over the years, not one celestial lord has tried to help that family turn the case around?”

The canal master’s lady was genuinely dazed this time, not pretending, and murmured, “Turn the case around? Wouldn’t that just lead to further enmity with the City God Temple, making it even less likely to obtain that treasure?”

Chen Ping’an took off his hat and looked up at the night sky, scratching his head. “So that’s it; that’s a very reasonable explanation.” 

Behind the temple’s divine platform, there were some sounds.

The canal master’s lady felt a gust of cool wind rush towards her and suddenly turned her head to look.

The divine platform had been smashed in half, dust flying everywhere, and the young wanderer from Ghostly Hammer Palace, Du Yu, who had just regained consciousness and wanted to take action, was seized by the neck and slammed into the ground.

When the dust settled, Du Yu’s energy had been completely cut off, leaving him dead beyond revival.

At that moment, the canal master’s lady, as a water goddess, felt a chill run through her body, as if she had fallen into an ice cave.

The wanderer turned his body and looked at her.

His expression was blank.

His gaze was as deep as an ancient well, as if in the depths of the water, a dragon was swaying, wanting to climb up the well wall to take a look at the world outside.

The canal master’s lady wanted to step back and distance herself, but her feet felt like they were stuck in the ground, forcing her body to lean back, as if that was the only way to avoid dying of fright.

For some unknown reason, the next moment, the wanderer suddenly smiled, stood up, dusted off his hands, adjusted his hat, and extended two fingers, fixing them lightly as he smiled, “Mountain cultivators are not tainted by worldly affairs, nor involved in causality—a self-evident truth.”

 ### Chapter 585: Suppressing a Line (Part One)

The lady of the water lord stared blankly at the hole in the back wall of the shrine, shaking her head gently before asking in a trembling voice, “Did the immortal master really kill that Du Yu?”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment and chuckled, “More like half dead. I’ve imprisoned his soul. In a sect as large as the Ghostly Axe Palace, with the Du family being a so-called partner of the mountain, how could I dare to be disrespectful? A small punishment is all.”

Unable to steady herself, the water lord’s wife fell onto the ground, her embroidered dress blooming like a resplendent peony in full bloom. 

This young man truly had a honeyed tongue but a heart filled with venom! Though he looked young, he must be an old monster who had cultivated on the mountain for countless years. What a ruthless and cunning immortal guest!

Chen Pingan shook off the dust clinging to his clothes with a flick, and his blue robe instantly appeared spotless. He walked past the broken divine platform, and as he passed by the campfire and the youth pretending to be dead, he teased, “Hurry up and wipe that drool, then keep pretending.”

The street-smart boy quickly complied.

Chen Pingan sat down on the threshold of the shrine, watching the water lord’s wife and her two maidservants as he took a sip from his sword-raising gourd, filled with dark, murky water.

There was a city god in the Treasure Bottle Continent named Shen Wen, a river goddess in the Tongye Continent, and even in the North Junlu Continent, there were the water lord’s wife, the lord of Cangjun Lake, and the city god of Suijia City.

Chen Pingan had indeed used a secret technique to gather Du Yu’s soul; it was not mere exaggeration to frighten the water god’s wife.

This was not some mountain-level immortal technique; it was a high-tier art he had traded for during his second deal with the True Monarch of River Cutting, Liu Zhimiao, at Booklet Lake. This technique consumed an immense amount of spiritual energy. At this moment, Chen Pingan’s water palace was depleted of spiritual energy, primarily because his key water-related item, the water seal floating in the palace, had drawn out nearly all of the water energy essence that had accumulated over time. Recently, he had been hesitant to explore the palace with his inner vision, unable to bear the mournful gazes of the green-clad boys there.

Chen Pingan took out a shiny white armor pill and a crimson pill engraved with dense symbols. These were precisely what Du Yu had intended to use, planning a surprise attack. The pill was the inner core of a demon beast, similar to a deadly strike that had once surrounded and attacked Mao Xiaodong in the capital of the Great Sui Dynasty. However, that had been a genuine golden core, while the one in his hand was far inferior, likely an inner core from a sea-viewing realm demon. As for the armor pill, it was presumed Du Yu had hoped to avoid mutual destruction, relying on this divine armor to withstand the explosion of the inner core.

It was a good plan.

At the time, when Chen Pingan heard about the old incident in Suijia City, he had indeed felt somewhat unsettled. Before, he had been distracted, observing Du Yu’s movements and the subtle expressions of the two maidservants.

Thus, in Chen Pingan’s moment of distraction, Du Yu had seized the opportunity.

Unfortunately, the subtle fluctuations in Du Yu’s aura had stirred up a bit of dust from the cracks in the wall, which the water lord’s wife might not have noticed at all. But to Chen Pingan, whose fist intent flowed like a stream, as if protected by the divine, it was as loud as thunder. After all, the punch of a tenth-level martial artist from the Desolate Mountain’s bamboo tower was truly silent until it suddenly exploded, and many times, Chen Pingan had to rely on guessing and gambling to avoid being hit too hard, as dodging was often impossible, even with Cui Cheng suppressing the fist intent at the distant travel realm. And during his sparring with Zhu Lian, this martial maniac had been forced by Cui Cheng to beat Chen Pingan half to death every day, without any care for technique.

In the end, it was merely that Du Yu’s cultivation was not high enough.

This was akin to Chen Pingan in the Valley of Ghosts, attracting the covetous gaze of Gao Cheng from Jingguan City; without hesitation, he had fled.

If Du Yu had not harbored any delusions and had chosen to flee directly upon regaining consciousness, Chen Pingan would have obstructed him but would never have resorted to lethal means, imprisoning his soul.

Chen Pingan put away the life-saving pill that Du Yu had kept hidden, placing it back into his sleeve. He held the white armor pill in his palm, slowly twisting it as he looked at the water lord’s wife. “I said before, you need to tell me everything you know. You’ve also mentioned that you won’t seek death again.”

The water lord’s wife collapsed on the ground, her expression sorrowful, her face filled with despair as she lamented, “Immortal master, I truly have not hidden anything. Are you trying to wrongfully accuse me?”

She fell to the ground, her face buried in her arms, her whole body trembling, pitifully sobbing, “What sins have I committed to deserve such wrongful accusations from the immortal master?”

As Chen Pingan stood up, the water lord’s wife immediately fell silent.

In the next moment, Chen Pingan squatted beside the water god, pressing his palm firmly on her head and pushing down heavily, causing her to faint, her head sinking into the ground.

The two maidservants were terrified, wanting to flee. One of them was struck in the back by the force of Chen Pingan’s sleeve, embedding her slender body into the wall, and she too fainted on the spot.

Only one trembling maidservant remained; as she took a step forward, it was as if a spell had been cast upon her, rendering her unable to move.

Chen Pingan turned and sat back down on the steps, saying, “You should be more honest than your sister who couldn’t learn to pass through walls. Earlier, the water lord’s wife mentioned a few details, and your eyes revealed a lot of information to me. Let’s hear it as if you’re helping your mistress check for leaks. No matter how you feel, I’ll say it again: I have no grudges or enmities with you. Killing a local water deity, even if they are just attendants, will still bring consequences.”

The maidservant was not foolish and sobbed, “The water lord’s wife respectfully calls you the immortal master, but I can’t help but see you more as a pure martial artist. That Du Yu also said you are a master of martial arts, and martial artists don’t need to bear the consequences of killing deities.”

Chen Pingan couldn’t help but laugh, smirking as he tapped the sword-raising gourd, and fifteen flying swords shot out, darting around him like sparrows circling tree branches. In the night, a streak of ghostly green sword light flitted rapidly around Chen Pingan.

The maidservant gaped in astonishment, “You truly are a sword immortal!”

It was said that the lord of Cangjun Lake feared those sword immortals who could take heads with their flying swords the most!

Chen Pingan chuckled, “If you say so, then so be it.”

The maidservant hesitated, and the expression of bitter despair on her face contrasted sharply with the water lord’s wife’s earlier pitiful demeanor; she was truly revealing her feelings.

If she revealed any secrets tonight, given the water lord’s wife’s suspicious temperament and the lake lord’s violent nature, wouldn’t that spell doom for her? Over the past few hundred years, there had been countless sisters who angered the lake lord for trivial matters, only to be lit up like water lanterns, their souls stripped away to serve as wicks, burning day and night. She couldn’t even count the number of sisters who suffered, and only when the last drop of essence oil from that water lantern fell could they finally escape their torment, but there would be no next life for them.

Chen Pingan had originally wanted to elaborate on the twists and turns and slightly reveal his future plans to reassure her, but in the end, he simply said one word, “Speak.”

The maidservant trembled at the command, no longer daring to harbor any delusions, and began to divulge the inside information she knew, spilling it all out to the young sword immortal.

The lord of Cangjun Lake was one of the highest-ranked water deities in the Kingdom of Yinping, and even when facing several mountain lords, he could stand on equal footing. He had always looked down upon the city god’s temple of Suijia City, especially since the fire god spirit had once had a feud with the water lord’s wife, nearly flooding Suijia City in a duel, forcing the fire god to appear before the citizens to apologize. It was only through the mediation of an old sword immortal that this was averted. However, the lake lord’s resentment towards Suijia City ran deeper; years ago, the governor had sent a secret letter to a friend in the capital, and while the city god’s temple had been kept in the dark, the lake lord had seen through it. He secretly sent the lord of Zao Creek to intercept the messenger, learning the content of the letter. The lake lord then handed a jade seal that could let water deities leave their realms to the creek lord, ordering her to accompany the messenger to the capital of the Kingdom of Yinping.

Chen Pingan, hearing this, asked, “What is the relationship between the fire god spirit and the city god’s temple?”

The maidservant replied, “The relationship is mediocre. In theory, the fire god spirit should be of a lower rank, but that deity doesn’t like to deal with the city god’s temple. During many mountain banquets organized by the immortals, the two sides almost never attend at the same time.”

Chen Pingan continued to inquire, “What is the lake lord’s attitude towards the city god’s temple?”

The maidservant softly explained, “The lake lord looks down on the city god even more. Our water lord’s wife sometimes drinks too much at the underwater dragon palace and returns home, only to tell us sisters that the lake lord laughs at that city god as a fool, a man who preferred to steal the poetry of the humble and then spend money to build his reputation. The Kingdom of Yinping chose such a fellow as the city god, only caring for his reputation and fame, neither capable of governance nor administration. He spends his days enjoying the moon and composing poetry, calling himself the Moon-Playing Immortal, enjoying his idle life without knowing how to manage people. Therefore, the disaster in Suijia City is clearly man-made, not a natural disaster. But on the surface, we maintain a decent relationship with the city god’s temple; the city god often brings nobles and dignitaries from the capital to the dragon palace for a visit, and the lake lord’s residence is filled with beautiful maidservants, each charming and alluring. Hence, the guests always leave satisfied.”

Chen Pingan remarked, “Since the city god’s temple has made such mistakes, they are bound to suffer the consequences, and the fire god spirit will certainly be implicated. In fact, your lake lord must be pleased with this outcome.”

The maidservant fell silent for a moment before bitterly smiling, “The lake lord is the chief water deity of a nation, with profound thoughts. A humble maid like me could never guess.”

Chen Pingan nodded, putting away the armor pill and lightly snapping his fingers, causing the maidservant to fall straight back, unconscious.

With a flick of his sleeve, he pulled the maidservant who had been embedded in the wall back into the courtyard, where she rolled on the ground and slowly regained consciousness. She felt a splitting headache, and her body felt like it was falling apart.

Chen Pingan asked, “Just now, this maid’s mind was a muddle; you looked cleverer, so what do you have to say?”

This maid wanted to kneel and beg for mercy, but with a flick of Chen Pingan’s fingers, she was sent flying back out of the shrine door. He then reached out, grasping her by the neck as they locked eyes. The maidservant saw the look in his eyes, her heart racing, her face pale, and she began to whimper, as if she had something to say.

Chen Pingan casually threw her onto the ground. She lay there, breathless, then took a deep breath, stood up, and turned to gaze at the water lord’s wife, her expression complex, filled with gratitude, reluctance, and resentment.

In the end, she straightened her face and spat contemptuously at the young immortal, coldly laughing, “I’m done!”

Chen Pingan merely waved his hand to disperse the spit, his expression unfazed as he sat on the steps, gently resting his hands on his verdant walking stick.

Once again, Chen Pingan flicked his fingers, knocking her unconscious.

Then, using his walking stick, he struck the ground, and a surge of energy hit the water lord’s wife on the back of her head, immediately waking her. She pulled her head from the ground and sat dazedly, looking somewhat confused.

Chen Pingan glared angrily, “You two foolish maids have been by your side for so many years, are they just dimwitted fools waiting to die?”

The water lord’s wife felt relieved; she had previously complained that the two maidservants were simpletons, not as clever as those seductive maidservants in the lake lord’s residence. However, now it seemed that was a blessing in disguise. If Cangjun Lake were implicated, not only would those two be in danger, but her own position as the water lord would also be at stake. The creek lord, that despicable maid, was fond of spreading rumors and striking from the shadows; she had already caused her shrine’s incense to wither for many years and now aimed to drive her to extinction. This had been a long-standing issue, and the entire Cangjun Lake was watching the show.

Chen Pingan said, “Go and call the lake lord, tell him I’ve helped him eliminate Du Yu from the Ghostly Axe Palace, and that he should come personally to thank me. Remind your lake lord that I am a person of integrity who cannot stand the stench of copper, so I only accept treasures from rivers and lakes that catch my eye.”

The water lord’s wife was taken aback, “Me?”

Chen Pingan sneered, “Or should I go?”

The water lord’s wife rose, prepared to use her innate divine powers to transform into mist and escape.

Chen Pingan pointed at the two maidservants lying unconscious, “Those two are far more beautiful than you, water lord’s wife. After the lake lord expresses his gratitude, I will visit Suijia City to obtain that heavenly treasure soon to be revealed. I will definitely stop by the underwater dragon palace; while I may not travel far in the martial world, I have read many books, and those literary records mention that dragon maidens are often affectionate, and their maidservants are alluring. I must see if they are more remarkable than your two maidservants. If the dragon maidens and the dragon palace maidservants are more beautiful, then you won’t need to seek new maidservants; if their beauty is comparable, I will take them all at once, and during my visit to the capital of the Kingdom of Yinping, I can sell them for a high price.”

The water lord’s wife quickly agreed, “It is a great fortune for these two maidservants to serve the immortal master…”

Chen Pingan interrupted her, mocking, “But if I find them disappointing after meeting them, then water lord’s wife, you and that creek lord, whom you are so close to, will have to accompany me to the capital.”

The water lord’s wife was not worried about this; anyway, with the lake lord backing her, as long as she returned safely to the Cangjun Lake dragon palace and saw the lake lord, everything would be easily manageable.

In the end, who would emerge victorious was still uncertain.

The water lord’s wife quickly shook her sleeves, sending two streams of verdant water energy to the maidservants’ faces, waking them up. She apologized to the young immortal and promised to return quickly.

Chen Pingan suddenly called out to the water lord’s wife.

She froze, turning back, “What else does the immortal master wish to command?”

Chen Pingan extended a hand, smiling, “Just lend me some water energy essence, not much, just two taels will suffice.”

The water lord’s wife felt both shocked and pained, yet relieved that the water energy essence was fundamental to a water deity’s cultivation. Compared to dying on the spot, this was indeed a better trade. She quickly pointed a finger at her forehead, a ray of azure light bursting forth, and then a golden thread cascaded down like a creek from the mountain top, flowing past her shoulder and down her arm, ultimately pooling in her palm, where a green water pearl popped out and gently pushed toward Chen Pingan. Wiping the sweat from her forehead, she smiled, “Immortal master, you say ‘borrow,’ but that truly shames this maid, this three or four taels of water energy essence should be a small token of gratitude for encountering the immortal master.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Compared to the Celestial Dew Cup, this is indeed small.”

The water lord’s wife dared not speak further.

The Celestial Dew Cup was indeed her lifeblood. There were very few celestial artifacts that water deities could use to enhance their cultivation beyond just refining their golden bodies through incense. The Celestial Dew Cup had once been a treasured item in the dragon palace of the lord of Cangjun Lake. The creek lord’s deep-seated hatred for her stemmed from this cup, which had a significant background. According to the lake lord’s words, it had once been an important ceremonial vessel in a grand Daoist temple, steeped in incense for a thousand years, gaining such effects.

After the three of them departed the shrine, Chen Pingan put away the water energy pearl. Although it was only four taels, it could quench thirst temporarily, even more effective than a spiritual pill, but it was by no means a long-term solution.

On the path of cultivation, some shortcuts could help qi practitioners quickly reach a halfway point, but the further one went, the more hidden dangers there would be.

Chen Pingan did not rush to refine the water pearl to replenish the spirit energy in the water palace but sat still, contemplating matters.

He understood that their trip may not end well. The lake lord of Cangjun Lake would most likely not come ashore to meet him. Would he, the lord of Cangjun Lake, come to help collect the body of Du Yu from the Ghostly Axe Palace? Once he set foot on land and entered the shrine, it would be like slapping Chen Pingan in the face, covered in filth. Would the Ghostly Axe Palace and Du Yu’s parents care whether the lake lord was implicated as a collateral victim or suffered from unjust calamity? Besides, as a dignified chief water deity of the Kingdom of Yinping, how could he feel justified in claiming to be a collateral victim?

As for the two maidservants in the shrine,

One had acted correctly on Chen Pingan’s side.

One had acted correctly on the water lord’s wife’s side.

Thus, both could live.

Chen Pingan twisted his wrist, revealing a sphere formed of ten strands of black smoke, which ultimately transformed into the tormented, contorted face of a man—Du Yu.

Whenever a gentle breeze brushed past, the sphere, composed of three souls and seven spirits, would writhe in agony as if the cultivator were suffering from the tribulations of thunder.

Such was the fate of the yin entities in this world, unwelcomed from heaven and earth. The half-dead Du Yu struggled to speak, his voice thin as a mosquito’s buzz, “Please, return my soul to my body quickly; there’s still a chance to be saved. As long as I can live, I, Du Yu, will extract three drops of heart’s essence, light three incense sticks, and respectfully inform heaven, earth, and my ancestors, swearing a secret oath of the sect, never to contend with you again. I absolutely won’t…”

Chen Pingan ignored him, speaking to himself, “What a lovely saying. How could it come out of your mouth so disgracefully? Hmm?”

Chen Pingan curled his fingers slightly, and threads of energy began to swirl, enveloping the soul sphere.

Du Yu immediately howled in despair.

Chen Pingan slowly said, “What does it feel like to be a chivalrous woman of the jianghu? Tell me, I’ve walked the jianghu too and never knew these things.”

Du Yu was about to open his mouth when Chen Pingan turned his head, but he increased the pressure in his hand, the energy growing denser, almost thick enough to freeze. Chen Pingan pretended to listen intently, asking, “What did you say? Speak up, I can’t hear you.”

Du Yu’s three souls and seven spirits had just been forcibly separated from his body by a secret technique, leaving him in an extremely weak state. Now he felt like he was suffering a fate worse than death, his soul in disarray, the ten strands of black smoke intertwining like a chaotic mess. If this continued, even if he escaped the cage, he would become a lost soul, devoid of wisdom, a wandering ghost, and any cultivator who encountered him would seek to eliminate him.

Chen Pingan released his fingers, lifting his hand and gently waving it forward; the corpse behind the shrine crashed into the courtyard.

Chen Pingan stood up, crouching beside Du Yu’s corpse, pressing down hard with his palm.

About a stick of incense later, Du Yu began to foam at the mouth, convulsing, blood pouring from his seven orifices, a terrifying sight—but this was a good sign.

If there were no such movements, it would mean that the body had rejected the soul’s entry. Once the soul could not find its way back, the three souls and seven spirits would ultimately drift away, susceptible to the numerous winds of heaven and earth, and would either dissipate or, by a stroke of luck, cling to the last bits of spiritual energy and light, becoming a yin entity.

Du Yu sat up, spitting blood, and quickly crossed his legs, beginning to perform hand seals, immersing his mind to calm the turbulent key energy centers in his body.

After Du Yu, soaked in blood, exhaled a mouthful of turbid air and turned his head to look, he saw that person squatting not far away, hands tucked into his sleeves, staring at the knife on the ground.

Du Yu’s thoughts raced.

That person remained completely still.

Du Yu sighed, abandoning any thoughts of fighting back, slowly standing up, tapping his chest three times with his fingers, his face contorting. Then, three drops of his heart’s essence ignited like incense, three wisps of blue smoke curling upwards as if three incense sticks had been lit. Du Yu lowered his head slightly, holding the incense at eye level, and declared loudly, “From this moment on, Du Yu, the disciple of the Ghostly Axe Palace, solemnly informs heaven, earth, ancestors, and masters, vowing never to seek revenge, that this grudge, like the separation of mountains and rivers, is to be left behind…”

Chen Pingan stood up, his toes pressing on the knife handle, gently pushing down. The blade flashed and seamlessly found its way back into Du Yu’s sheath.

Du Yu was so frightened that his legs went weak again.

This was the result of once being bitten by a snake; he was now fearful of ropes.

Chen Pingan, holding the walking stick, walked toward the shrine’s entrance, “Meeting is fate; I have some matters I’d like to discuss with you.”

Du Yu was in turmoil, cursing his bad luck for running into such an “honest” senior.

Chen Pingan looked calm, “Do you know why you can return to life?”

Du Yu forced a smile, “Are you looking for the two talismans from our Ghostly Axe Palace? If I reveal the secrets of our ancestral hall, I’ll be kicked off the Long Life Bridge and expelled from the sect.”

Chen Pingan replied, “Heaven knows, earth knows, you know, I know; what’s there to fear? Besides, you’ve been roaming the jianghu for so many years and dared to use a water deity as bait; would you be afraid of these rules? People like you find joy in breaking rules.”

Du Yu felt an increasing sense of dread.

Only a person who had attained the Great Dao could speak so naturally about such callousness.

Similar phrases had been said to him by his parents in private.

Chen Pingan continued, “If you had died tonight at the Water Immortal Shrine, it would be hard for the Ghostly Axe Palace to find me, and even harder for the water lord’s wife and the lake lord to find me. In the end, it would just be a muddled account. So what you should be worried about now isn’t leaking sect secrets but rather that I might learn the talisman drawing techniques and the corresponding incantations, eliminating you to silence you once and for all.”

This was a tactic he had learned from the scholar in Ghostly Valley, framing and slandering.

Du Yu fell silent.

The young man with the bamboo box and walking stick spoke gently, resembling a friend chatting casually, “Now that I understand your logic, let’s discuss mine. We’ll get along much better.”

Du Yu halted, “How can you guarantee that after I reveal the Stele Talisman and Snow Mud Talisman, you won’t kill me to erase all evidence?”

Chen Pingan also stopped, turning his head, “You can only gamble your life.”

Du Yu lamented, “Senior! I have already sworn a heavy oath! Why must you be so aggressive?”

Chen Pingan looked surprised, “You rely on your skills as a disciple of a great sect to come down and play in the jianghu, treating lives as mere trifles. Isn’t it the same as me treating you like an ant, playing with you at my fingertips? Is that hard to comprehend? Is your stupidity not a cause for your parents’ concern?”

Du Yu could only weep in silence.

Running into such a “sincere” mountain senior, did he truly have to blame himself for not checking the almanac before this trip?

Chen Pingan gazed toward the distant Cangjun Lake, “Once the lake lord comes ashore, you may not have another chance to speak. Using two talismans to buy a life, I find this deal quite worthwhile.”

Du Yu gritted his teeth, “Then I’ll wager that you wouldn’t want to dirty your hands and be burdened with karmic consequences.”

Chen Pingan shifted his gaze toward Suijia City, a smile that was neither a smile nor a frown on his lips.

Du Yu dared not draw his knife, instead breaking off a dry branch, squatting down to begin drawing the talismans while whispering the incantations.

The Stele Talisman, when carried, could excellently conceal one’s form and aura, akin to an ancient turtle bearing a stele, silent for a thousand years as if dead.

However, the cultivator’s own perception of the outside world would also be restricted, and the range would significantly shrink. After all, such things in this world rarely allow for perfect outcomes.

This talisman was one of the Ghostly Axe Palace’s specialized assassination techniques.

As for the Snow Mud Talisman, it was a highly sought-after talisman by many mountain formation masters, also known as the Flying Bird Seal, an ancient talisman from the Ghostly Axe Palace, a signature technique of the sect’s founding ancestor. However, the disciples of the Ghostly Axe Palace had mostly only grasped the superficial aspects, rarely the essence. Du Yu was one such disciple, but his mother was indeed proficient in this art; she had been the best in crafting Snow Mud Talismans over the past three hundred years. She had once secretly taught this talisman to a top-tier great cultivator from a celestial mansion, which had greatly elevated that person’s abilities. After the Ghostly Axe Palace learned of this, they had not yet reprimanded their own, but an opposing mountain faction had come to demand accountability, leading to a distasteful confrontation that ultimately ended without resolution. The ancestral hall’s punishment for his mother was merely ten years of closed-door reflection, a mere flick of the finger in the grand scheme of cultivation.

Chen Pingan recalled later that the top-tier great cultivator who had received the Snow Mud Talisman had quietly come to the Ghostly Axe Palace, likely to plead for leniency on behalf of his mother.

Initially, Du Yu was still worried that this person was merely coveting the two talismans, thinking that having more skills wouldn’t burden him. He had prepared himself to speak at length as a frustrating teacher. He didn’t expect that the person would just listen to him explain everything from the main points of the two talismans to the specific details and the subtle key points without any questions, simply making Du Yu repeat himself three times. During the second repetition, Du Yu, overly familiar with the talisman’s true meanings, inadvertently skipped a seemingly insignificant phrase, only to notice that the person squinted, lightly lifting the walking stick that had been resting on the ground. Du Yu nearly slapped himself, hastily correcting his mistake and repeating it word for word.

After three repetitions, the person lowered his head, looking at the two talismans drawn on the ground.

Du Yu didn’t dare to breathe.

The person used the walking stick to trace the talismans, imitating him, creating two relatively crude Stele Talismans and Snow Mud Talismans. As the talismans were completed, their spiritual light flickered and shone brightly; although the quality of the talisman cores was not high, they had indeed been formed.

Du Yu’s forehead broke out in fine beads of sweat.

Heavenly Mother, talismans were truly not easy to master. Otherwise, why would his father, even with a high level of cultivation, and the ancestors of their sect never be deemed “understanding of the divine will”? Indeed, some cultivators were simply not suited to drawing talismans. Thus, the talisman sects often had the brutal saying, “One can tell whether a person is a ghost or a god at first stroke of the brush.”

This senior before him was certainly an expert! He might just be a hidden master of talismans!

What pure martial artist? That was all a ruse…

Yet thinking this, Du Yu couldn’t help but feel incredulous. If this were true, wasn’t this senior far too unreasonable?

Chen Pingan erased the four talismans they had drawn with his walking stick, dissipating their spiritual light. “Your sincerity is sufficient, so let’s do some real business now.”

Du Yu asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”

Chen Pingan took out the armor pill and the demon transformation pill from his sleeve, “They say walking on dark roads often leads to encounters with ghosts. I had good fortune today; I picked these up by the roadside earlier. I think they suit your cultivation. What do you think? Do you want to buy them?”

Du Yu, with righteous fervor, declared, “It’s rare for the senior to part with them; just name your price! Even if I have to sell my pots and pans, I, Du Yu, am willing to pay generously!”

Chen Pingan nodded, recalling something, extending a finger. A small green water pearl spun around, and after setting aside a portion, roughly the weight of one tael of water essence, he smiled, “This is a gift from the water lord’s wife, considered my goodwill. Since you’re injured and urgently need spiritual energy, this water energy pearl is fundamental to a water deity’s path. Hurry up and refine it.”

Du Yu had no choice but to take the pearl, gently pressing it against his heart, silently refining it. His expression turned bizarre.

Was this really a pearl condensed from water essence?

Not only did it not feel uncomfortable, but it also descended like a sweet rain upon the heart lake, filling his soul with a refreshing sensation.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Alright, let’s discuss business. One piece of such high-tier divine dew armor and a transformation pill with such immense offensive power, how much do you plan to offer for this bargain?”

Du Yu cautiously asked, “Senior, could we trade goods instead? I don’t have much divine money on me, nor do I have the legendary Fangcun Tomb or the Zhichi Cave Heaven.”

Chen Pingan smiled and nodded, “Of course.”

Du Yu took out a small, shimmering embroidered bag from his bosom, moving gently. He opened the knot, revealing a folded page of scripture, which, when unfolded, showed no creases at all.

Du Yu said, “This item is exceptionally precious. I obtained it years ago during a fierce battle in a dilapidated ancient temple. My parents told me to keep it safe, saying it was worth a fortune. To trade this item, it would at least require a treasure of small summer coin.” 

Chen Pingan took the page, which was inscribed with golden characters.

He smiled and accepted it, handing the armor pill and demon pill over to Du Yu.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Pingan turned to face Cangjun Lake, leaning on his walking stick.

Du Yu instinctively took a step back.

His expression turned stern, but he still did not dare to speak.

Determining life and death was never an easy matter.

For this reason, Chen Pingan could not entirely conceal that vague sense of emotion.

Previously, by the banks of the black river in Ghostly Valley, that Over-Sea Lord had turned to beg the scholar, who was clearly more untrustworthy, for mercy after hearing Chen Pingan’s assurances, insisting that the scholar take an oath before she would open the river’s restrictions.

Perhaps she had sensed at that moment that her life and death were already determined.

At this moment, so was Du Yu.

Life and death hung by a thread; a cultivator’s intuition was always remarkably accurate.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 586: Pressing Down a Line (Part 2)**

Du Yu spread his hands, staring blankly at the two precious treasures that had been lost and then regained, only to be on the verge of slipping away again. He sighed, raised his head, and smiled, "Since that's the case, Senior, if you still want to do this deal with me, isn't it just like taking off your pants to fart? Or are you intentionally trying to force me into action, hoping I, Du Yu, will dream of wearing a divine armor and tossing out demon cores, so that you can justify killing me without any burden of karma? You truly are a person of the mountain peak, so calculating. If I had known I could meet such a high-minded person in this shallow pond-like world, I certainly wouldn't have been so arrogant and blind."

Chen Ping'an gazed into the distance and asked, "So the lady of the canal master said you are the son of a Daoist couple?"

Du Yu nodded, saying, "One surname Du, the other Yu, so I'm Du Yu."

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, "That's a nice name."

He raised his hand and waved, "You can leave now, and don't let me run into you again."

Du Yu forced a bitter smile, "I'm afraid that if I turn around, I might just die. Senior, I really don't want to die here, it would be too suffocating."

Chen Ping'an replied, "That's true. Then how about you walk with me for a while? I'm going to find that canal master of Zao Creek. Do you know the way?"

Du Yu nodded.

The two of them truly climbed over mountains and ridges, heading toward the Zao Creek territory together. 

Along the way, Chen Ping'an asked about the situations in the dozens of countries including Silver Screen Country, above and below the mountains.

Du Yu naturally answered every question.

That senior flew between the mountain ridges, darting like a dragonfly skimming the water, his figure almost a mere faint blue shadow, and even his wind-based movement seemed a bit laborious. However, when he asked questions, he would walk on foot, giving Du Yu the opportunity to speak steadily.

As they walked through the forest, after hearing about the deeds of the golden boy and jade girl, Chen Ping'an laughed and asked, "What’s with this young man, He Luo from Huangyue City, and the fairy Yan Qing from Baodong Fairyland? They sound like characters from a chivalric novel. Is it just because of their respective mountain factions being enemies, and the century-old grudges of their sects, that they can’t become a pair of immortal lovers?"

Du Yu replied, "Perhaps it sounds ridiculous in your eyes, Senior, but even I, Du Yu, when seeing those two, feel ashamed and know what true jade-like beauty of the Dao really is."

Chen Ping'an remained noncommittal.

The two arrived at a mountain peak, looking westward to see the Zao Creek territory, with the Water God Temple not far away.

Chen Ping'an asked, "The city god temple's treasures have appeared, did you come for this?"

Du Yu didn't dare to hide anything, saying, "Apart from me, there’s also a senior uncle and three junior brothers and sisters heading to Suijia City together. But the extraordinary treasures have long been preordained by Huangyue City and Baodong Fairyland. We at Gui Fu Palace are just here to cheer for our better-connected Baodong Fairyland, to boost their momentum. As for me, not to make you laugh, Senior, I just want to see Huangyue City and Baodong Fairyland fight until their brains explode. I want to see He Luo and Yan Qing meet, and they will have to love and kill each other, both with faces that look like they’ve eaten shit. Just thinking about it puts me in a good mood."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Do you consider yourself a true scoundrel?"

Du Yu chuckled awkwardly, "Senior, you flatter me. I don’t dare to claim such a title."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "That 'true' is indeed a heavy word."

Du Yu sincerely said, "Your words, Senior, seem casual, but if you ponder them carefully, every word is profound and thought-provoking."

Chen Ping'an looked at him with an odd expression, "Are you trying to steal my business?"

Du Yu, confused, was as silent as a cicada in winter.

The two continued on their way.

Compared to the nearly abandoned Water Immortal Temple, where even the golden statue was missing, the Zao Creek canal master’s temple was more grand and had a denser incense atmosphere.

It was obvious that the Water Goddess was skilled in management.

However, since she could suppress another canal master to the point of rendering the temple useless, she was certainly no easy opponent.

As they descended the mountain, Chen Ping'an recounted the tragedy of Suijia City to Du Yu, asking him to inquire about the sealed letter.

Du Yu felt that he had already died twice tonight and had no fear of offending a mere canal master. So he didn't hesitate at all. Not to mention a small river goddess like the Zao Creek canal master, even if the Lord of Cangyun Lake stood before him and irritated him, he would still chop without hesitation. If it weren't for that senior suggesting a good negotiation, Du Yu would have already kicked down the door and slashed him half to death, then let that Zao Creek canal master come and discuss business with him. Afterward, he would end his life with one stroke, to relieve the grudge in his heart. It’s all your fault, Cangyun Lake, for having such poor feng shui, causing me to have to follow behind that person like a tail-wagging dog, and what's worse, I have to worry that if I wag my tail wrong, I might be slapped to death for no reason.

The two of them restrained their auras, walking down the mountain on foot, so as not to alarm the snakes in the grass.

Chen Ping'an casually asked, "If you had known about the tragedy in Suijia City earlier, what would you have done? Just speak your mind."

Du Yu laughed and said, "Naturally, I would have just kept my distance. A city god from a county isn’t something a mere river goddess can handle. Not to mention the possibility of killing him, even if I could, the karma would be too heavy. Moreover, the enmities of the rivers and lakes and the disputes of the officials are really not interesting; it’s always the same trifling matters. But to be fair, our own mountain isn’t much better. There are indeed quite a few who sincerely focus on cultivating the Dao, not harming others or saving others, just quietly and peacefully. I’m just a bit hot-headed, and since I’ve hit a bottleneck in my cultivation, I went to the rivers and lakes for some fun."

Du Yu was a bit anxious, so he asked, "My heartfelt words won’t annoy you, will they, Senior?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "No. I've seen too much; it's hard to stir up ripples."

Du Yu fell silent for a long time and suddenly said, "But if I truly were the person at the peak according to my parents, perhaps I’d be so pleased that I might casually chop down a city god if I found him displeasing. As for that governor’s wrongful death case, it’s none of my business; I wouldn’t meddle. Such things are thankless labor. As for killing the city god, I don’t seek fame, only profit; the shattered golden body of a water deity would be worth a fortune. In the current situation, if it weren’t for the treasures appearing, entering Suijia City would just be for eating, drinking, and having fun, then leaving."

Chen Ping'an said, "Once you become that person at the peak, you’ll find that a city god from a county can't even pique your interest in profit. Many of the thoughts you cling to today are merely what you’ll be able to laugh off in the future."

Du Yu pondered this, then self-deprecatingly said, "I have decent aptitude, but I don’t have the same good foundation for cultivation as the city lord of Huangyue City and the old master of Baodong Fairyland. Not to mention those two already achieved the Dao, but just He Luo and Yan Qing, they are the mountains I’m destined to never surpass in this life. Sometimes, while fooling around in the rivers and lakes, I drink and feel that the saying about drowning sorrows in wine is not a lie."

Chen Ping'an asked, "In your years wandering the rivers and lakes, have you seen those... foolish people in the rivers and lakes?"

Du Yu laughed, "Of course, but most of them are dead. If they aren't dead, it's hard to see their character; if they are dead, well, it's just the same."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "When you're not so tense, you can say some harsh words."

Du Yu was left speechless.

Listening to that awkwardness, why was he feeling a bit grateful?

The two descended the mountain and walked along the gently flowing wide creek for several miles. Du Yu spotted the brightly lit temple, which was grander than most, and pressed his hand against the hilt of his sword, whispering, "Senior, something doesn’t feel right. Could it be that the Lord of Cangyun Lake is personally waiting here for us to fall into a trap?"

Chen Ping'an, having seen that Du Yu didn’t behave unusually all along the way, recalled that he had absorbed that essence water drop, which should not have been tampered with, but did not directly refine it. Instead, he had tossed it into the Water Palace for the green-clad boy to help extract, while immersing his mind in a small realm. With inner sight, his Yin spirit condensed like a mustard seed, personally traversing the Water Palace, while in the outside world, that small water drop felt like a heavy object in his hands. After the green-clad boys obtained the water drop, Chen Ping'an wasn't sure how they examined it, but each of them was extremely excited, showing for the first time a look of appreciation towards Chen Ping'an.

He understood then; the more, the better.

So he had to make a trip to the Zao Creek canal master’s temple.

If it weren’t for being too afraid to intrude on the Cangyun Lake Dragon Palace, Chen Ping'an would have wanted to do "business" with that lake lord.

It's the same kind of business, but with different methods.

The business dealings with Du Yu and the Zao Creek canal master were fundamentally different from the transactions Chen Ping'an had with the disciples of the Pima Sect.

One side counted every penny; even a copper coin less would make them consider killing you.

The other side was willing to earn less, even if it meant suffering losses.

Hearing Du Yu's reminder, Chen Ping'an teased, "Earlier at the Water Immortal Temple, weren’t you shouting that you would go a few rounds with the lake lord if he came ashore?"

Du Yu laughed, "Teaching a lesson to a senior like you, I'm truly on edge right now, making a joke of myself."

Chen Ping'an patted his shoulder, "If there’s more fighting, don’t say anything about letting a single strike go this time."

Du Yu felt disgruntled.

He thought about finding an opportunity to kill those young brats from the marketplace? If word got out, wouldn’t that be a huge joke?

But that guy laughed, "If I haven't killed anyone, and you run back to kill them, is that a return of favor, teaching me how to be human? Or do you think you’re lucky enough to never encounter someone like me again in this life?"

Du Yu felt a chill run down his spine and firmly said, "Senior, your teachings, I will remember!"

Chen Ping'an continued walking slowly, smiling, "Being kind to others is difficult, but is it so hard not to trample on the common folk or do evil? But then again, it's true; to live freely and unrestrained, who doesn't yearn for it? Once you learn the arts of the immortals, you are no longer of this world, and to think of the burdensome compassion as an encumbrance is somewhat excessive. It’s like how a commoner views caged chickens and dogs, only to turn around and eat vegetarian food; that would indeed be asking too much."

Du Yu hesitated, unsure whether to determine if this speech was sincere or not. So he resolutely remained silent.

Chen Ping'an let out a soft sigh.

Even if he pressed down one line again and again.

Would it really work?

He adjusted his hat and continued forward.

Upon reaching the temple’s exterior.

Chen Ping'an stopped, "Go on, scout out the situation. If you die, I’ll definitely help collect your corpse, and maybe even help you take revenge."

Du Yu held back for a long time, finally saying helplessly, "Senior, you really... don’t stand on ceremony with me."

He tightened his grip on the soldier's armor pill, feeling it flow through his body like mercury, donning the divine armor of the gods.

Du Yu strode boldly through the open doors of the temple.

In less than half a stick of incense, Du Yu returned with a look of utter despair, standing beside Chen Ping'an and whispering, "That Yan Qing just happened to be visiting inside. I was afraid of complications, so I didn’t get to business."

Chen Ping'an didn't mind and asked curiously, "The fairy from Baodong Fairyland?"

Du Yu nodded heavily, "The cultivator from Baodong Fairyland just arrived at Cangyun Lake. Yan Qing has a cold personality and doesn’t like the hustle and bustle of the Dragon Palace, so she came here alone for some peace."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Was He Luo not inside?"

Du Yu froze for a moment and then shook his head, "Senior, they wouldn’t be that bold, would they? With two factions about to fight to the death in Suijia City, would they secretly arrange a meeting right under the noses of their respective sects' seniors? That Zao Creek canal master may keep his mouth shut, but those two shouldn’t be so impatient. One has a cold temperament, and He Luo is quite devoted to the Dao."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Baodong Fairyland made such a grand visit to the Dragon Palace, and you know Yan Qing's temperament well; wouldn't He Luo know? Would Yan Qing be unaware of whether He Luo would understand her intentions? Do they need to arrange such a meeting in advance? With the battle imminent, if they were truly acting with integrity, wouldn’t tonight's meeting be their last chance? Moreover, considering the commotion we caused at the Water Immortal Temple, the canal master probably rushed to the Dragon Palace to warn them, which should have disrupted their plans. Perhaps right now, He Luo is hiding somewhere, blaming you for ruining her good fortune. Is Yan Qing looking at you with disfavor? How about the canal master’s gaze and words? Can they validate my guess?"

Du Yu’s face was full of sweat, "Earlier, I was only thinking about barging into the mansion and chopping people, trying to score some small merit for you, Senior, so I truly didn’t think that much."

Chen Ping'an didn’t rush to enter the temple. He glanced at the anxious Du Yu and then surveyed the surroundings, casually asking, "How have you survived in the rivers and lakes? Or is it that in the dozens of countries including Silver Screen, the customs are all simple? But at the Water Immortal Temple, I saw that your cultivators, deities, and commoners didn’t seem all that simple either."

Du Yu had no choice but to say, "Compared to a senior like you who can calculate everything down to the last detail, I’m just embarrassing myself."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Calculating everything down to the last detail, hmm, that’s a good phrase; I’ll remember it."

Du Yu felt depressed, wondering what good it would do to remember that.

Chen Ping'an began to step forward, leading the way across the temple's grand entrance.

The mansion was magnificent, entirely unlike the temple.

Upon reaching an inner door adorned with a golden plaque reading "Flowing Green Waters."

A woman in ceremonial dress with a phoenix crown stood gracefully, her peach blossom eyes slightly elongated, with a faint smile.

Beside her stood a young woman dressed in white, wearing a golden crown with phoenix wings, exquisitely crafted. With a gentle breeze, the golden phoenix tail swayed, faintly echoing the sound of a young phoenix's cry.

Chen Ping'an only glanced at the two women before focusing on that golden crown for a few more moments.

It appeared to be a rather good magical artifact.

According to earlier instructions, Du Yu stood shoulder to shoulder with Chen Ping'an, pretending they were long-time friends from the rivers and lakes. The senior was known as "Chen the Good Man," a wandering cultivator.

Before entering the temple, Chen Ping'an asked Du Yu if the two inside had any means to observe the mountains and rivers.

Du Yu nearly spat out a mouthful of old blood, even their Gui Fu Palace’s ancestors needed to use sect treasures to activate such magic. Besides the city lord of Huangyue City and the master of Yan Qing, or the lord of Cangyun Lake, and the gods of the Five Peaks, who in their respective mountains would dare claim they could observe the mountains and rivers?

Chen Ping'an smiled, "My brother Du Yu and I, this time, are here to visit and consult the canal master’s wife about a small matter."

The canal master’s wife smiled, "Since you call it a small matter, then there’s no need to rush. I have important matters to discuss with Fairy Yan tonight. Why don’t you come back tomorrow?"

Du Yu dared not show any expression, or else he would have to give a thumbs up to the Zao Creek canal master. 

She was truly a heroic woman; her spirit of heroism was no less than his own phrase "I'll let you have the first strike."

However, this was the proper way to receive guests.

Who was Yan Qing?

The temple was also by Cangyun Lake.

Moreover, with the masters of Baodong Fairyland visiting the Dragon Palace.

What face could a wandering cultivator, who claimed to be friends with Du Yu, possibly have?

Du Yu merely observed with his eyes and kept his thoughts hidden, glancing at the sky.

At this moment, he was afraid the sky might fall.

But even if it did fall, it would be fine.

If this senior casually slapped Yan Qing once or twice without concern for strength, given the notorious protective nature of the Baodong Fairyland’s old masters, they would certainly not let it go, and the lord of Cangyun Lake would most likely feel embarrassed to stand by and do nothing…

At that point, it would be a scene of magical artifacts clashing and overwhelming the sky.

However, the reason Du Yu felt serious and not too pleased was that he feared that Baodong Fairyland and Cangyun Lake would join forces to beat up a wandering cultivator.

And in the end, they might find themselves being challenged one-on-one by that person.

Du Yu actually knew that this kind of thinking was absurd and ridiculous.

No matter how strong this person was, when facing a master from Baodong Fairyland alone, he would likely find it extremely challenging. Once trapped in a siege, escaping would be uncertain.

Yet Du Yu couldn’t shake the intuition telling him that the least likely scenario might just be the ultimate truth.

Chen Ping'an straightforwardly said, "I learned that in Suijia City, you personally opened that sealed letter sent by the governor who died violently before his death, and you even visited the capital of Silver Screen Country with the sender, right?"

The fairy Yan Qing’s expression was cold, completely indifferent to these mundane matters.

Du Yu believed that even if she heard it, it was like she hadn’t heard it at all.

Because his parents had said that true geniuses of the Dao like Yan Qing and He Luo viewed worldly matters as trivial as snowflakes in mud, their hearts as clear as mirrors, leaving no trace.

The Zao Creek canal master remained calm and smiling, saying, "If you’ve finished asking your questions and heard the answers, then can you and Du Xianshi leave?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "The canal master’s wife acted according to her duties back then, so I’m not here to accuse you. I just feel that since events have come to this, with Suijia City about to fall into chaos, such trivial matters—no matter how small—wouldn’t harm the overall situation if we brought them into the light, I hope the canal master’s wife…"

The canal master suddenly grew furious, her authority unmistakable. She stepped forward and directly interrupted the wandering cultivator's words, "Get out!"

Chen Ping'an remained unfazed, "Revisiting old matters, indeed I, an outsider, am being troublesome. For the canal master’s wife, it might be too much to ask. If the wife is worried about the lord of the lake, I can…"

The canal master abruptly raised her arm, pointing at the door with a fierce expression, "Get out! Who do you think you are? How dare you speak so boldly here, not afraid of dirtying the ears of Fairy Yan?! If it weren't for Du Xianshi, you’re a worthless wandering cultivator who wouldn’t even make it through this door! Do you think this water god temple is just any place?"

Chen Ping'an turned to Du Yu, "Brother Du Yu, did you just focus on looking at Fairy Yan during your earlier visit?"

Du Yu felt as if he had lost everything, his heart in turmoil, yet he dared not show any signs. He could only force a stiff expression, making his face look somewhat distorted.

The temple was intricately built.

At that moment, a handsome young man appeared on a slanted roof, hands clasped behind his back, his sleeves billowing in the wind, with a yellow bamboo flute tied around his waist, floating like an immortal.

He said softly, "Canal master’s wife, one should show mercy when possible."

Yan Qing’s eyes lit up, but quickly returned to her cold demeanor.

Du Yu, sharp-eyed, felt as if he had just eaten something unpleasant, still warm.

Just as this senior had predicted.

Earlier at the Water Immortal Temple, He Luo had most likely been wandering nearby, waiting for a chance to find Yan Qing, and then discovered some clues. However, this person had never gotten too close.

After all, with the imminent battle, seeing a beloved woman was the most important matter.

Everything else, in He Luo’s nature, was either watching from the sidelines or waiting.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "He’s much better at concealing himself than you are."

Seeing the figure standing high above, the canal master’s wife immediately changed her demeanor, performing a grand greeting, graceful and charming, speaking gently, "I greet you, Master He."

Chen Ping'an patted Du Yu's shoulder, "Brother Du Yu, it seems you have no business here tonight. Each person must bear their own responsibilities; don’t interfere."

Du Yu felt like he could die.

He was currently covered in mud, and even jumping into Cangyun Lake wouldn't wash it off. Whether this guy escaped or died here, he, Du Yu, would still be left with a layer of skin stripped away, perhaps becoming the target of ridicule among the cultivators of the ten or so countries.

Du Yu tried to maintain a stern expression, saying, "Chen brother, I won’t leave. Your business is… my business too!"

The handsome young man had a hint of a mocking smile at the corner of his mouth.

However, when he turned to look at the graceful Yan Qing, his expression softened.

Chen Ping'an looked up again at the plaque that read "Flowing Green Waters."

The words had a good meaning and depth.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Canal master’s wife, how about I use celestial coins to buy your old matters? Of course, we can also include any grievances related to the lord of Cangyun Lake in the mix."

Du Yu’s eyelids twitched.

Here it comes.

What he feared most was this senior meddling with his inscrutable business dealings.

Perhaps He Luo’s words had a significant impact.

Although the Zao Creek canal master still looked displeased, she no longer spoke harshly and waved her hand, "Let’s discuss this later. Tonight, I will not receive guests here."

Du Yu remained silent.

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, "Then we will visit again tomorrow."

Hearing the word "we," Du Yu felt his heart sink.

Chen Ping'an, holding his walking staff, truly turned to leave.

There was still some time before the chaos at Suijia City, and Chen Ping'an didn’t want to create too much of a commotion.

However, he was still somewhat puzzled.

Why had the lord of Cangyun Lake, the masters of Baodong Fairyland, not yet activated their means of observing the mountains and rivers to spy on this place?

These two surely couldn’t possess powers greater than that of the legalist master of the Pima Sect.

But Chen Ping'an stopped walking.

Du Yu was a bit confused.

Chen Ping'an turned his head and saw the canal master feigning a frown, asking, "What else do you want? Do you really want to stay here and not leave?"

Chen Ping'an laughed.

If this canal master’s wife were merely a cultivator and not the water deity of the temple, she would likely be sensed by the higher-ranked He Luo and Yan Qing if she spoke to him with her heart’s ripples.

Earlier, she had quietly said, with a bright smile, "You, wild cultivator, have walked all the way here and dirty my house’s floor; bring some water tomorrow, or else don’t even think about entering."

Chen Ping'an was not particularly angry; he just found it somewhat annoying.

Moreover, it was reminiscent of Du Yu’s unwittingly spoken phrase "a spring breeze in passing."

In the world of Haoran, the term "wild cultivator" was certainly not a flattering one.

He Luo began to frown.

Yan Qing also displayed an expression of impatience.

In an instant, the entire Water God Temple trembled.

Outside the mansion marked "Flowing Green Waters," a massive web suddenly erupted.

Chen Ping'an had already stepped onto the steps, still holding the walking staff, and grasped the canal master’s neck, slowly lifting her into the air.

Looking up, the once graceful canal master had lost all her former demeanor, her golden body shaking as if struck by lightning, divine light scattering, unable to coalesce, only able to beat her hands against the arms of the man in the hat.

Yan Qing had already darted out.

With a flick of her wrist, a flash of light slipped from her sleeve, revealing a short sword without a sheath in her hand.

He Luo reached out to grasp the bamboo flute, saying in a low voice, "I still maintain my earlier statement: show mercy when possible…"

Chen Ping'an turned his head to look at them, one high and one low, standing in the same direction, and smiled, "This canal master’s wife is not even human anymore. Moreover, aren’t you cultivators supposed to avoid worldly entanglements as much as possible? You come here to meet, and your respective sects might not even be unaware. The Zao Creek canal master’s Water God Temple is merely a recognized stepping stone between Huangyue City and Baodong Fairyland. So, are you going to stop me? Be careful not to break this stepping stone; otherwise, the sects behind you won’t have any way out."

The canal master struggled desperately, her beauty paling horrifically.

Du Yu surprisingly felt a sense of pleasure.

As if after speaking reason, regardless of whether it was indeed reasonable or not, it was all the more exhilarating to throw punches afterward.

He Luo smiled, "I advise you not to seek death…"

Yan Qing’s vision blurred.

Just as she wanted to make a move, to slice down with her sword.

But hesitating for a moment, she retreated.

Summoning a protective treasure from her sect, she shielded herself.

As for the canal master, who had been casually tossed aside, once she sheathed her sword, she had no interest in giving her another glance.

When cultivators engage in combat, one slip could cost them their lives; whoever is distracted will die first.

However, Yan Qing suddenly felt her heart tremble, turning to look.

A faint blue figure appeared near the slanted roof, as if a hand knife had struck He Luo’s neck, sending him flying, and then that blue-clad figure pressed down on He Luo’s face, pushing downwards, sending He Luo crashing through the entire roof, landing heavily on the ground. From the sound, He Luo’s body even bounced once on the ground before collapsing.

He wouldn’t die; he definitely wouldn’t die.

He Luo was wearing a high-quality magical robe.

Yan Qing's mind was in disarray.

Suddenly, that person seemed to have used a technique that shrank the distance, appearing right beside her.

Just as Yan Qing was about to draw her sword.

That person flicked a finger, hitting the sword’s body precisely, causing Yan Qing’s face to pale slightly. Just as she was about to make a move, she found that the person had already brushed past her, stepping on the recently awakened canal master’s forehead, suddenly exerting force, the aura like thunder.

With another kick.

The canal master’s head and upper body sank into the ground.

Chen Ping'an, still holding his walking staff, stood at the edge of the pit and said to Yan Qing, "Aren't you going to check on your beau?"

Yan Qing was just about to leap away but, upon seeing that person’s hopeful action while holding the walking staff, she halted, taking a step back to wait for the right moment to flee. As long as she escaped to Cangyun Lake, she would definitely join forces with her sect to surround and kill this person!

Chen Ping'an turned to Du Yu, laughing, "Are you blind? What kind of nonsense is this golden boy and jade girl, a pair of born celestial lovers?"

Yan Qing’s expression was as cold as ice, her eyes shimmering with a deep-seated hatred and killing intent for the first time.

But the young man wearing the hat lightly stomped his foot, sending the canal master flying out of the pit, then kicked toward the main door, holding his walking staff, striding forward with his back confidently turned toward her and her sword. The blue-clad guest raised his hand and waved, "Go see."

In the end, that person dragged the Zao Creek canal master away from the mansion, presumably heading towards Cangyun Lake.

Du Yu bent over, scurrying after him.

Yan Qing stood there, stunned.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 587: Not Listening to Reason is the Best Approach

Along the emerald, tranquil Zhaoxi Canal, the water plants swayed gently, resembling water spirits beckoning for attention.

In many urban legends and literary anecdotes, there are tales of water spirits seeking vengeance by replacing the deceased, often revolving around the concept of revenge. However, once the realms of Yin and Yang are separated, life and death become distinct. The usual drowned spirits are not skilled practitioners of the myriad arts, and thus finding a simple method of relief is far from easy. The harm that spirits in the underworld inflict upon the living is real, while the hope of self-rescue is merely a fallacy propagated by scholars.

After leaving the Water God Temple, Chen Ping'an pulled the still-unconscious wife of the canal master toward Cangjun Lake. Du Yu, clad in the divine Ganyu Armor, continued to follow on the winds. He felt a bit anxious and asked whether he should remove the eye-catching armor to avoid causing trouble for his senior. 

Chen Ping'an replied that it was unnecessary.

Du Yu felt slightly relieved, but the next words from his senior sent his heart racing again: “When we reach the shore of Cangjun Lake, a fierce battle may ensue. At that point, you won’t need to do anything. Just consider it another gamble with your life—stand aside and pretend to be deaf and mute. After all, the situation can hardly worsen for you; you might even recover a bit of your losses.”

Du Yu chuckled. “Don’t worry; I might not be able to help much, but I guarantee I won’t be a hindrance.”

Chen Ping'an simply smiled in response.

Du Yu glanced at the canal master’s wife, feeling as if he was in a different world, filled with emotion. His parents had always said that great practitioners possess deep methods. Whether it was the lord of Huangyue City or the founder of Baodong Wonderland, anyone with a foundation and a sect would have their own way of doing things, so they might not be so fearsome. What truly terrified him were the four characters “the world is unpredictable,” which, because of their lightness, made them difficult to grasp.

In the past, Du Yu had little interest in such abstract principles; he dismissed them as mere nonsense. Yet, as he journeyed through the region of Cangjun Lake that night, he found it far more thrilling than all the times he’d traversed the rivers and lakes combined. Now, he didn’t care to ponder deeply or ask questions; whatever this senior said was fine by him. The plans of someone at the peak of the mountain were beyond his understanding. Rather than guess blindly, he preferred to leave it to fate.

This wandering senior, who acted with clouds and mist around him, had one admirable quality—he was genuine.

So, along the way, Du Yu asked questions and answered them honestly, deciding that it was better to speak his mind than to feign ignorance and act clever. After all, whatever kind of person he was, this senior had likely seen through it all long ago.

Chen Ping'an suddenly recalled something, dropped the canal master's wife onto the ground, and abruptly stopped, but didn’t wake her.

Du Yu was lost in thought, and in a moment of distraction, he flew past that blue-clad guest by several dozen feet. He quickly returned, scanning the surroundings, hand resting on the hilt of his blade, and asked, “Senior, is there an ambush? Should I scout ahead?”

“The lake lord of Cangjun Lake and the old ancestor of Baodong Wonderland are both highly skilled. Why would they need to ambush us? If we set up an array by the lakeside, just a glance from you, Du Yu, would be enough to chill your heart,” Chen Ping'an shook his head and posed a question back at Du Yu, “In the Silver Screen Kingdom, among a dozen or so countries, there are quite a few practitioners. Doesn’t anyone ever want to venture further out to explore? For instance, the Bone Shore to the south, or the Dayuan Dynasty in the center?”

Du Yu shook his head. “I can’t speak for other practitioners, but in our Gui Fu Palace, we’ve had a family motto passed down since the first day we entered the path of cultivation. It roughly means that future generations should not travel far carelessly but focus on cultivating at home. My parents often tell their disciples that our place is rich in spiritual energy, a rare paradise beyond the world. If we attract the envy of poor practitioners from outside, it would spell disaster. However, I don’t quite believe this, which is why I have traveled through the rivers and lakes for so many years. Actually…”

At this point, Du Yu hesitated, stopping mid-sentence.

Chen Ping'an said, “You’ve answered my question honestly. The rest, you can speak or not. I’m not particularly interested in your tales from the rivers and lakes.”

Du Yu immediately understood, took a few steps closer to the senior, and lowered his voice, saying, “This is a strange matter. My parents have been quite indulgent toward me, but whenever I bring this up, they grow tight-lipped, saying that some things aren’t meant for me to know. Ignorance is indeed bliss. Naturally, I wouldn’t dare to act recklessly. So, I thought of a compromise: taking advantage of my travels through the rivers and lakes to explore a bit further each time. Ultimately, I’ve managed to grasp some understanding.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “It seems you’ve tasted quite a bit of the rivers and lakes?”

Du Yu grinned. “My little escapades are nothing compared to a senior like you, who travels across continents, carefree and at ease, traversing thousands of miles in a single step.”

Du Yu continued, “In the end, I’ve found that the borders of the dozen or so countries seem to form an invisible chasm. The spiritual energy there is especially thin, almost as if a mountain peak immortal, living in the clouds, has drawn a circle on the map of the mortal realm, shielding us while preventing foreign practitioners from intruding, making them dare not cross even a little.”

Chen Ping'an softly asked, “Is it similar to the method used by Cui Dongshan with his flying sword to draw a Thunder Pool? What’s the purpose?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, but for now, he had no leads and put this thought aside.

However, if it indeed related to the appearance of treasures from the driving city, forming a hidden thread of connection, he would need to be more cautious.

Thus, in the upcoming journey to Cangjun Lake, if negotiations fell apart and the worst-case scenario arose, one must not simply act recklessly, pouring everything out for the sake of momentary satisfaction.

The sword immortal behind him must remain hidden.

As for the flying sword, Fifteen, kept inside the Sword Nurturing Gourd, had previously appeared at the Water Immortal Temple. The maid would definitely describe him as a “sword immortal,” so he could use it depending on the situation. However, he needed to remind Fifteen to slow down a bit when flying out of the gourd once the fighting started.

As for the walnut beads in his hand and the three talismans from the Dayuan Dynasty’s Yunxiao Palace, during seemingly “urgent and perilous” moments, he could choose one or two to display in the moonlight.

As for his physical prowess and the durability of his body, he would keep it under control at the peak of the Fifth Realm for now.

Previously, the Water God Temple's actions against the canal master and He Lu were a deliberate act of misdirection, appearing as if he had already exerted his full strength, leaving no room for leniency.

Some things, no matter how well concealed, might not work out; after all, isn’t it a good habit for everyone in the world to always consider the worst-case scenarios? So, it was better to let the enemy witness the reality.

Carefully weighing each matter, pondering over each event.

He walked alone through the rivers and lakes for thousands of miles.

Chen Ping'an had always proceeded this way.

Today, he only practiced his martial arts more and carried more items.

He had transformed from a muddy-footed boy in straw sandals to a young man in a white robe with a jade hairpin, and now to a traveler in a green shirt with a travel staff.

What flying swords and Thunder Pools.

Du Yu pretended he hadn’t heard anything, nor did he understand.

Just like earlier, when this senior casually made the empty wine jug disappear, it was likely stowed away in the dimensional storage his parents frequently mentioned, filled with longing and desire.

Du Yu pretended not to see it.

Chen Ping'an used his travel staff to tap the canal master’s wife on the forehead, waking her up.

The canal master’s wife was indeed more calculating than the lady from the Water Immortal Temple, sprawled on the ground without any intention of getting up, softly saying, “To offend the great immortal master is a grave sin. I will never forget your grace of sparing me.”

Chen Ping'an spoke straightforwardly, “I want to kill your lake lord and destroy his dragon palace. You will lead the way.”

The beautifully adorned, elegantly composed canal master’s wife showed no change in expression. “Does the great immortal master have a grudge against the lake lord? Is there some misunderstanding?”

Chen Ping'an frowned. “Enough nonsense. Get up and lead the way.”

The canal master's wife regained some of her previous grace from the Water God Temple, gracefully stood up, and offered a charming bow.

Unexpectedly, she kicked the blue-clad guest wearing a conical hat flying away.

Clenching her teeth, she said nothing, only getting back up quietly.

The canal master’s wife detested this wild cultivator to the core, along with the unfortunate Gui Fu Palace’s practitioner. 

However, if she lacked the ability to read the room and gauge the situation, she would not have reached her current divine position.

A water ghost who died after being soaked in a pig cage was able to rise step by step to today’s status, even forcing the Shakexi canal master to abandon the temple and move the golden statue into the lake, making it so that the three river gods under the lake lord regarded her as a sibling. She did not rely on any golden body cultivation or mortal incense.

Feigning fear, she trembled and asked, “Does the great immortal master wish to travel in the water or ride the wind on the shore?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I prefer to walk on foot along the shore.”

Though the canal master’s wife was shocked, she didn’t dare defy this grim temperamental figure, and could only stubbornly walk ahead.

Indeed, wild cultivators were despicable beings.

When they reached the junction of the Zhaoxi Canal and Cangjun Lake, it was this person who knelt down and begged for mercy before ultimately meeting a fish’s belly.

However, she couldn’t help but feel some suspicion. Why had the profound Daoist Yanquing and the proud child of Huangyue City, He Lu, not been seen?

It was true that these so-called celestial guests from the clouds and the forest were all virtuous on the surface, but in reality, they were hard-hearted and not good people.

Du Yu found it amusing.

Earlier, when the canal master’s wife fainted in the Water God Temple, she had missed that wonderful performance. 

If she had witnessed that scene, this little river lady would likely be unable to harbor any malice now.

Chen Ping'an recalled a certain maid by the Shakexi canal master’s side and looked at the current Zhaoxi canal master, turning to Du Yu with a smile, “Brother Du Yu, it seems that fate hangs by a thread to reveal character.”

Du Yu hurriedly called out, “Chen brother,” and then said, “Just some nonsense.”

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

Du Yu followed suit, merely taking his time to travel.

As for the senior’s intention to kill the lake lord and raid the dragon palace, Du Yu didn’t believe it. It wasn’t that he doubted the senior’s supreme power, but rather… it just didn’t align with the senior’s business sense.

In the Water God Temple, the senior had struck He Lu’s neck with a single blow, rendering her unable to retaliate as she crashed through the roof. 

From this, it was evident that the reason Yanquing could still stand until the end, not like He Lu lying flat on her back or the Zhaoxi canal master with her head buried in the ground, wasn’t due to the senior’s compassion.

Naturally, the true reason was beyond Du Yu’s understanding. 

He simply felt that this greatly skilled senior was quite ruthless when it came to beautiful women, whether they were practitioners or deities.

Chen Ping'an casually asked, “Earlier at the temple, Yanquing wielded her sword but didn’t draw it. Instead, she sought to retreat, presumably knowing she was at a disadvantage and wanting to seek help from Cangjun Lake. Du Yu, what do you think is in her deepest thoughts? Is it more about saving herself or saving He Lu?”

Du Yu laughed. “Yanquing did the most correct thing—self-preservation and saving others simultaneously. I believe that even if He Lu saw it, she wouldn’t harbor any ill feelings. If we were to put ourselves in her shoes, He Lu would likely make the same choice. However, in the rivers and lakes, many heroes, despite knowing they are walking into enemy traps, still rush in headfirst, which is laughable yet honorable… though there are some who truly do that.”

Chen Ping'an contemplated for a moment, seemingly enlightened, nodding. “Not being of the same family means not entering the same door. Those like He Lu and Yanquing can indeed live in harmony, their hearts in sync.”

The Zhaoxi canal master, who had been eavesdropping on their conversation, sneered inwardly.

Trying to deceive me?

With this wild cultivator, who calls Du Yu his brother, how dare he speak of Yanquing being aware of her disadvantage?

However, the canal master’s wife felt a slight tremor of anxiety. What if it was true?

After all, she had been as weak as a mud dog before this wild cultivator. This was an undeniable fact.

Forget it, one step at a time. As long as they reached Cangjun Lake, everything would become clear. If the sky were to fall, the lake lord and the ancestor of Baodong Wonderland would bear the brunt.

She truly didn’t believe anyone could withstand the combined assault of those two deities, even if this person was flayed and skinned, their soul captured, and then splashed with water lanterns. When the time came, she would definitely ask the lake lord for a wisp of soul to place in her Water God Temple!

Chen Ping'an glanced at the Zhaoxi canal master ahead. “How come someone like this, akin to a worldly brothel madam, can thrive so well at Cangjun Lake?”

Du Yu tentatively replied, “Perhaps only like this can she manage to thrive?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Brother Du Yu, you’ve just spoken a truth.”

Du Yu suppressed his laughter but finally couldn’t hold back, bursting into hearty laughter. It was the first time tonight that he felt so delighted.

Seeing him getting a bit carried away, Chen Ping'an tugged at the corner of his mouth. “Is it that funny?”

Du Yu felt as if someone had grabbed his throat and immediately silenced himself.

Chen Ping'an remained silent for a long while before asking, “If you were that scholar, what would you do? Let’s split it into three scenarios. First, by chance, escaping from the Driving City and seeking refuge with family friends. What would you choose? Second, succeeding in the imperial examination and making a name for yourself, entering the Hanlin Academy of the Silver Screen Kingdom. Third, gaining fame and a bright future, being assigned as an official and returning to your hometown, only to be noticed by the City God Temple, landing in a situation where you’re bound to die.”

Du Yu grinned.

This time, Chen Ping'an didn’t want him to speak directly but said, “Genuinely think it over, there’s no rush to answer.”

When under the eaves, one must bow their head. Du Yu contemplated seriously for a long while and finally said, “For the first scenario, if I had the opportunity to know that there are others above humans, that practitioners exist in the world, I would strive to cultivate the arts of the immortals, seeking the path of cultivation. If that doesn’t work, I’d work hard to study, aiming for an official position. Just like that scholar, I would seek revenge, of course, but I must survive. The better I live, the greater the chance for revenge. For the second, if I sensed that the City God Temple was involved, I would be more cautious. I wouldn’t mingle with the high officials of the six ministries of the Silver Screen Kingdom, absolutely not leaving the capital, and I wouldn’t return to Driving City easily, ensuring a lethal strike. If I didn’t know beforehand how deep the involvement was and was still in the dark, I might think like that scholar, considering myself the governor of a region, a key official, young and promising, a future heavy minister in the emperor’s heart, capable of dealing with some bandits, even an old case, certainly with ease. For the third, as long as I can survive, whatever the City God wants me to do, I will do it. I won’t say ‘if I die, I die.’”

Chen Ping'an said, “So, it’s still quite difficult for us to truly put ourselves in another’s shoes.”

Du Yu felt a bit embarrassed.

He should have thought deeper. After all, this senior was a true peak master. When it came to observing the affairs of the mortal world, he likely could appreciate what it means to be profound and far-reaching.

After this, Chen Ping'an stopped speaking.

Du Yu was pleased with this, feeling much lighter in spirit.

He realized that tonight, his mind was moving faster than ever.

Compared to the Shakexi Canal’s waters from the Water Immortal Temple, the Zhaoxi Canal was broader and deeper. Many villages originally built along the Shakexi had gradually migrated to this canal with better water conditions over the centuries, leading to a natural decline of the Water Immortal Temple’s incense. It was no wonder that the Green Water Mansion could be built so magnificently; the divine beings relied on incense, while earthly mansions relied on money.

The canal master of Shakexi, who had fled back to the lake’s bottom dragon palace, was utterly outclassed by the colleague walking ahead of Chen Ping'an. Otherwise, the lake lord of Cangjun Lake would not have assigned the Zhaoxi canal master to handle that secret letter, granting her the token of the lake lord, allowing her to leave the jurisdiction of the Zhaoxi Canal and travel through mountains and rivers to the capital to manage relations. Du Yu was well aware of the various deities of Cangjun Lake. According to this Gui Fu Palace practitioner, the dragon palace of Cangjun Lake was akin to a brothel on a mountain, primarily used to attract wealthy and idle outsiders. 

And where did those renowned dragon palace maidens come from? Naturally, from the nearly abandoned Zhaoxi Canal, where floods from the other three rivers had long since swept through, and in earlier years, passing immortals had taught a way to break the drought. This required selecting a young maiden as a sacrifice, thrown into the water to plead forgiveness. During times of severe drought, local officials would often go to the lake lord’s temple to pray for rain, and it would usually be effective. Afterward, when the rains fell, they also needed to throw a girl into the water to repay the lake lord’s kindness.

Du Yu said that all these schemes were the work of the Zhaoxi canal master. 

She often disguised herself as a woman, visiting officials in plain clothes under the guise of a secret inspection, traveling around the jurisdiction of Cangjun Lake in search of talented and beautiful girls from the market. When these girls grew up, the three lakes would inevitably unleash heavy rains, flooding the area, or she would use her abilities to disperse rain clouds, creating a drought for hundreds of miles. Over the years, local officials had become all too familiar with the ancient tradition of throwing a girl into the water; the people had also resigned themselves to the belief that one person’s misfortune could lead to the proper balance of weather, turning it into a celebratory event. Each time, the chosen girl would be dressed in bridal attire, adorned beautifully. The families of those girls would receive a hefty sum, and the elderly in the market would say that once the girl was thrown into the water, she would soon be taken back by the lake lord to his dragon palace, where she could enjoy the carefree life of an immortal, free from worry—truly a tremendous blessing.

The connections with the capital and local wealthy youngsters, including the specific welcoming and sending-off, were all orchestrated personally by this Water Goddess. Thus, she was greatly valued by the lake lord. However, there was one thing she couldn’t compare to the Shakexi canal master, who was a dragon’s subordinate and had been by the lake lord’s side long before his official position was established in the Silver Screen Kingdom.

Earlier, when Du Yu had mentioned these things upon arriving at the Zhaoxi Temple, he expressed some respect for the canal master’s wife, saying she was a clever deity. To him, she was somewhat underappreciated as just a small river lady. If he were the lake lord of Cangjun Lake, he would have already helped her secure a position as a river god. As for the river deity, that would be too much, given that there was little major flooding in the Silver Screen Kingdom, and a clever woman finds it hard to work without rice. It seemed the entire water transport of the kingdom was largely dominated by Cangjun Lake.

They were now less than ten miles from Cangjun Lake.

Chen Ping'an suddenly stopped.

The Zhaoxi canal master hesitated before stopping as well.

She turned her head, her peach blossom eyes naturally shimmering with water mist. She appeared puzzled and timid, as if she wanted to ask something but didn’t dare to, while inwardly she was sneering. Why had they stopped? Was this wild cultivator, who had spoken so boldly earlier, now aware of the dangers ahead?

Du Yu had already made up his mind to just watch the show; after all, this was what the senior had said.

Chen Ping'an turned to look.

It was indeed Yanquing who had followed.

He Lu had not trailed behind but might be hiding far away. This talented young practitioner likely excelled at concealment or evasion techniques.

Though she seemed a bit frail.

Otherwise, Chen Ping'an would have found it more troublesome.

The young female practitioner of Baodong Wonderland, dressed in white and crowned with a delicate golden crown, floated on the wind. Compared to Du Yu, it was undeniable that regardless of gender, she looked more pleasing, her graceful figure soaring through the air was certainly a sight to behold.

Du Yu noticed that the senior had glanced at him, seemingly with a touch of pity?

What was this? Did the senior want him to go to Cangjun Lake alone into a trap?

Senior, didn’t you say I could just watch from the sidelines?

Chen Ping'an remarked, “Yanquing is pursuing us.”

Du Yu followed his gaze and indeed saw a small white dot appear at the edge of his vision. He froze and said, “This Yanquing wouldn’t be out of her mind, refusing to believe in evil, wanting to wrestle with you, senior… I mean, Brother Chen?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “Some people have thoughts that I simply cannot comprehend.”

The Zhaoxi canal master felt reassured.

Once Yanquing arrived, even if they hadn’t reached the edge of Cangjun Lake, she should be safe.

Although unsure why the two sides hadn’t fought to the death in their own temple, since Yanquing insisted on following, it meant this wild cultivator would be in trouble if he dared to act again. In a battle at the Green Water Mansion, how much chaos could a crude wild cultivator and a Gui Fu Palace practitioner, who only knew how to curry favor with the two ancestors of Baodong Wonderland, stir up?

Yanquing landed gracefully, her short sword sheathed, only a few steps from the blue-clad guest, yet she continued to move forward slowly.

The Zhaoxi canal master, who considered herself somewhat perceptive, felt pleased. Look, Yanquing truly didn’t regard this person as a threat. Knowing that he excelled in close combat, she remained completely unconcerned.

Du Yu looked at this renowned young immortal, who was said to be a match made in heaven with He Lu.

No matter how envious he felt in the past, he had to admit that looking at Yanquing now, if he set aside He Lu, she was truly stunning.

This made Du Yu feel a bit disgruntled.

Having a plate of mountain delicacies within reach yet unable to taste it felt even more frustrating than being forced to eat a mouthful of hot feces.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Is there something else?”

Her expression remained cold as she continued forward, her gaze resolute. The heart cultivated by a practitioner had clearly returned to clarity, its ripples having faded.

Chen Ping'an raised his travel staff and pointed it at the flawless-looking immortal. “It’s time to stop.”

Yanquing didn’t insist on moving forward and indeed halted.

Du Yu took a sniff. As expected of one praised as a natural born immortal, the fragrance of orchids that lingered on her was something unattainable in the mortal realm.

Yanquing spoke, “He was kindly advising you. Why did you have to resort to such harsh measures against him?”

The previously carefree canal master’s wife twitched at the corner of her mouth.

Harsh measures? In the face of various practitioners and deities living near mountains and rivers, who would truly be a fool?

The canal master’s wife glanced sideways at the nearby Zhaoxi Canal, wanting to use her divine powers to transform into mist and escape.

With his back to Du Yu and the Zhaoxi canal master, Chen Ping'an flicked his wrist, sending the travel staff flying toward the canal master’s wife, striking her forehead with a heavy blow, causing her to see stars and sway unsteadily.

The travel staff returned along the same path, landing back in Chen Ping'an’s grip. “Yanquing, how was the tea you had at the Water God Temple tonight?”

Though young, Yanquing was a shrewd practitioner, catching the sarcasm in his words, and replied nonchalantly, “The tea was good, so it was enjoyable. Regardless of when or where, or with whom one drinks tea, it is all external matters. A practitioner’s heart should be untainted; even in the midst of mud, it is not an issue.”

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, uninterested in further banter.

However, Yanquing said, “You may proceed to Cangjun Lake’s dragon palace. On the path of the Dao, we walk our own roads. I will not take any extra actions.” 

Chen Ping'an turned around, signaling the canal master, who was still rubbing her forehead, to continue leading the way.

Yanquing followed behind them.

Chen Ping'an wasn’t concerned.

Moments later, Yanquing kept her gaze fixed on the long sword behind the blue-clad guest. She asked again, “Are you intentionally traveling down the mountain as a martial artist?”

Unfortunately, he remained silent.

Du Yu chuckled, feeling light on his feet, relishing in the fact that Yanquing was now walking behind him, like enjoying fine wine.

After walking about a mile, Yanquing asked again, “Why do you insist on inquiring about a long-past matter of the mortal world? Is it a key clue to obtaining that treasure?”

Still, there was no answer.

Yanquing’s expression remained calm, and she pressed on, “What is your name? Since you’re a high person, surely you wouldn’t hide your identity?”

Du Yu couldn’t resist, deciding to tease this Yanquing immortal a bit. He turned his head and laughed, “I dare not hide anything from Immortal Yanquing. My elder brother here, his surname is Chen, and his name is Haoren. Although he is a rogue cultivator, he has the most chivalrous heart, wandering the world with his sword. Whenever there is injustice in the mortal realm, he feels compelled to intervene. I have known Brother Chen for many years. Initially, we met in the rivers and lakes, and after some sparring, I came to admire him immensely for both his cultivation and character. Every night, in quiet moments, I must question myself, how can there be such a remarkable man in the world?! What merit do I, Du Yu, have to be fortunate enough to meet him?”

Chen Ping'an remained indifferent.

Yanquing shot a cold glance at the hopeless Du Yu, sneering, “You’ve known each other for years? At the Water Immortal Temple of the Shakexi canal master? Is it possible that tonight, there, you got hit on the head and are now babbling?”

Du Yu laughed heartily, unbothered.

Yanquing’s eyes turned icy. “We’re only a few steps away from Cangjun Lake. Although my two elders from Baodong Wonderland have not come down the mountain this time, if they later find out that you, Du Yu, have had the good fortune of befriending such a wild cultivator, with time passing in the mountains, once the outsider leaves, the temple remains. Aren’t you afraid of trouble arising from your own words?”

I’ve returned from the gates of hell twice and fear your nonsense? Du Yu not only didn’t flinch but shot a fierce glare at Yanquing’s small mouth, then smiled and remained silent.

Yanquing smiled. “You’re Du Yu of the Gui Fu Palace, right? I’ll remember you and your sect.”

At this, Du Yu felt a bit uneasy.

Chen Ping'an turned to Du Yu and smiled. “Brother Du Yu, you should change this bad habit of getting too carried away. The celestial maidens on the mountain are not like the female heroes of the rivers and lakes with gray hair after sixty years; they have long memories.”

Du Yu nodded earnestly, “You’re right, Brother Chen. A single piece of advice is worth more than a thousand riches. I will surely guard this wealth well from now on.”

Having gambled with his life once, he decided to gamble again. 

As long as this senior could safely navigate the Cangjun Lake tonight, regardless of whether they became enemies or not, if others wanted to target him, they would have to weigh their lives against this “wild cultivator friend” he shared life and death with.

Naturally, both he and his sect, Gui Fu Palace, wouldn’t relocate, but as long as the senior didn’t die in Cangjun Lake, the mountain practitioners weren’t fools; they wouldn’t easily take on the role of bait on a hook.

It was only at this moment that Du Yu began to realize why his senior had said that he might recover some of his losses from this trip to Cangjun Lake.

Of course, the dangers were still immense, and the aftermath boundless.

However, on the path of cultivation, aside from rare individuals like Yanquing and He Lu, how many others could enjoy the comforts of life? How was Du Yu any different from the many close calls he’d faced down below?

Thus, Yanquing, this little maiden, was still somewhat shallow in comparison to this senior who had lived for hundreds or even thousands of years; her insights and experiences were not yet sufficient to cultivate a true dragon.

After this, Yanquing stopped speaking and quietly followed behind the group.

As they approached Cangjun Lake, the view opened up magnificently. 

This was indeed the largest body of water within the Silver Screen Kingdom.

Tonight, the moon was full.

The emerald waves stretched for a thousand miles, shimmering in the moonlight, both colors complementing each other beautifully.

Due to the Zhaoxi Canal’s entrance to the lake, a dock had been established, but this waterway was specifically reserved for hosting esteemed guests from the capital. The canal master did not allow common folk to step foot on it.

Standing at the dock, with the refreshing breeze brushing against him, Chen Ping'an leaned on his travel staff, looking out into the distance, and asked, “Du Yu, if I were to punch down and accidentally kill a hundred people, how many would be wrongfully accused?”

Du Yu blinked, finding this question difficult to answer, and felt hesitant to speak up.

After all, Cangjun Lake was right before them.

Yanquing’s threatening words were not mere bluster. The rules on the mountain had been like this for generations.

The Zhaoxi canal master, seeing that Cangjun Lake seemed quiet, grew increasingly anxious, standing at the front of the dock. After hearing the wild cultivator’s question, she finally began to panic.

If there were a medicine for regret in the world, she would buy several pounds and swallow them whole.

Earlier, in the Water God Temple, if she had been just a little more polite and casually dealt with that wild cultivator, it wouldn’t have escalated to this life-and-death situation.

Regardless, in the temple, the wild cultivator had come to her territory, first inviting Du Yu in to greet her, then entering himself. The words that had sounded so ridiculous and annoying at the time now seemed to carry some reason.

Yanquing suddenly spoke, “It’s best not to kill indiscriminately out of anger here; it’s meaningless.”

Chen Ping'an slowly moved forward, standing next to the Zhaoxi canal master, as if they were standing side by side to admire the lake view.

With both hands resting on his travel staff, he softly asked, “Among those girls offered to the lake lord as maidens, were there any who were unwilling, swore they wouldn’t comply, and were then coerced by family? Were their parents heartbroken, dying in despair? Were there any childhood sweethearts wanting revenge, only to be crushed by your finger? Answer honestly, was there anyone? If there’s just one, that’s enough.”

The Zhaoxi canal master began to tremble, her teeth clenched.

Chen Ping'an pressed, “Will there be a change? Can you make amends? Will Cangjun Lake change?”

The canal master nodded vigorously, on the verge of tears, saying, “As long as the great immortal master speaks, I will surely repent!”

But that figure under the conical hat merely said, “I didn’t ask you; I already know the answer.”

Just as the canal master was about to kneel and beg for mercy, she suddenly turned her gaze toward Cangjun Lake, her eyes shining with excitement.

She straightened her back immediately.

Du Yu shrank his neck, swallowing hard.

A tall man in a dragon robe, with a face like jade and a crown atop his head, appeared on the surface of Cangjun Lake, surrounded by stars, along with the three river gods, the smiling Zhaoxi canal master, and dozens of dragon palace civil and military officials, all with a ferocious aura. Behind them, hundreds of shrimp soldiers and crab generals lined up, each performing their duties.

Among them were also several extraordinary celestial practitioners, closest to the middle-aged man.

There stood a robust old woman, her stature comparable to the man in the dragon robe, wearing a crown similar to Yanquing’s, but even more radiant, glittering under the moonlight.

Behind the old woman stood more than ten long-breathing, radiant practitioners.

It was none other than the lake lord of Cangjun Lake, Yin Hou, and the ancestor of Baodong Wonderland, Fan Weiran, who had left the dragon palace banquet to see the so-called foreign sword immortal from the Shakexi canal master.

One was one of the two greatest dragons within the borders of a dozen nations.

The other was the most powerful local tyrant in the Silver Screen Kingdom.

Originally, they had been enjoying a sumptuous banquet filled with delicacies and intoxicating celestial brew, chatting merrily, until the flustered Zhaoxi canal master arrived and spoke words that dampened the mood.

She reported that from the Water Immortal Temple came a strong figure of unknown origin, who had casually killed the Gui Fu Palace’s Du Yu and even threatened to flatten the Cangjun Lake dragon palace, abducting the dragon maidens as playthings. Furthermore, she claimed that the immortal from Baodong Wonderland was of no account; should there be any obstruction, he would kill them all.

The lake lord Yin Hou, who had ruled over the waters for a thousand years, was no fool. Familiar with this vile woman’s loose tongue, he immediately struck her with a sweep of his sleeve, causing the Zhaoxi canal master to tremble, falling to the ground in agony. Following that, this incompetent Zhaoxi canal master dared not embellish further and recounted the events at the temple in full.

The practitioners from Baodong Wonderland only viewed it as a lively spectacle to add to the drinking fun. As for the sword immortal, naturally, no one believed it. It was said that it was witnessed by a maid beside the Zhaoxi canal master, who claimed that a miniature flying sword had flown out from a wine jug. But the words of a lowly maid could only be taken with a grain of salt.

The ancestors of Baodong Wonderland, Fan Weiran, remained silent throughout.

As for the matter concerning the City God Temple in Driving City, he had indeed heard of it in the past but hadn’t paid much attention. It was only after signs of significant treasures appearing had surfaced that he began to investigate, and he had a general understanding of the process and the background.

Two practitioners from Baodong Wonderland who had come down the mountain even had a small conflict with some local immortals in the capital, which the latter regretted later, leaving them with their tails between their legs.

Fan Weiran frowned, “Qing girl?”

Yanquing at the dock smiled slightly. “Don’t worry, ancestor. It’s nothing serious.”

The lake lord Yin Hou squinted his eyes.

Indeed, she was a breathtaking beauty who could bring a kingdom to its knees. If he could be fortunate enough to have a dalliance with her, it would at least add a hundred years to his cultivation.

It was just too bad that the Baodong Wonderland treated her like a treasured gem, and this delicate little one, Yanquing, was the apple of Fan Weiran's eye, making it impossible for Cangjun Lake to approach her.

It was rumored that Yanquing and He Lu were a pair of sweethearts, but looking at Yanquing’s posture and demeanor, it seemed she had yet to fall into He Lu’s grasp.

Yin Hou quietly swallowed a mouthful of dragon’s saliva.

At the dock, the Zhaoxi canal master could no longer care about anything, leaping towards Cangjun Lake, shouting, “Lake lord, save me!”

Yin Hou laughed heartily. “Do you need saving?”

The next moment.

The imposing lake lord Yin Hou, akin to an earthly emperor, erupted in fury.

Just as the canal master was about to touch the lake's surface with her feet, she was grasped by the blue-clad guest’s hand, who pulled her back toward the dock. Gripping her head with five fingers, he forcibly ripped the canal master’s sacred form from her mortal shell.

The two were separated.

The canal master’s body slumped to the ground.

The forced revelation of her golden body caused the Zhaoxi canal master to emit a heart-wrenching wail.

She desperately beat the blue-clad youth’s arm.

Before the gaze of the lake lord Yin Hou and Fan Weiran, that youth suddenly increased his strength, crushing the golden body’s head. The golden form shattered into countless golden lights, dissipating at the dock, for she was but a river lady, unable to even gather a fragment the size of a fingernail.

The youth said indifferently, “There’s no need for saving.”

Du Yu looked up at the moon, pretending to be oblivious.

I see nothing. I can see nothing.

Yanquing was shaken to her core, feeling as if she had been struck by a fist, her heart pounding violently.

Fan Weiran smirked.

Now, this lake lord of Cangjun Lake, under the eyes of everyone, had lost face before both his own and others. He could no longer refrain from taking action.

As Yin Hou’s anger surged, the waters near the dock began to churn, waves crashing against the shore, one after another.

Then, that astonishing blue-clad guest said something that could only be a joke, “Want to hear some reasoning?”

He glanced at the lake lord of Cangjun Lake and then at the amused Fan Weiran, finally answering himself, “It seems you don’t want to. I prefer it that way.”

A dead silence fell across the heavens and earth, and the moonlight remained as silent as ever.

Du Yu felt a surge of heroism within his heart. Damn it, if only he could have such courage one day, it would be worth it to die! Of course, it would be best to leave half a life behind after being beaten up, and then come back for another round!

Damn it, so this was how heroes and champions could operate? Previously, all his small skirmishes in the rivers and lakes seemed trivial in comparison!

Yanquing’s emotions were tumultuous, her expression complex.

She gazed at that figure.

Like a tiny mustard seed, standing alone amidst the vastness of heaven and earth, he didn’t seem like a wild cultivator, nor would he be a celestial master from the mountain. Rather, he appeared to be a true wanderer journeying with a sword across mountains and rivers, seemingly… a bit lonely?

Yanquing was infuriated by this inexplicable thought and quickly steadied her mind, silently reciting the celestial incantations.

Then she saw that he first removed the bamboo box, gently placing it by his feet, then took off the conical hat, setting it atop the bamboo box.

He planted his travel staff into the ground, embedding it into the dock.

Then he began to roll up one sleeve leisurely.

Once settled, he merely stood with his sword on his back, a wine gourd hanging at his side.

Finally, he gazed at Cangjun Lake and slowly spoke, “No need for politeness. You can all come at once. Let’s see if my fists are harder or your treasures are more numerous. If I flee today, I won’t be called Chen Haoren.”

Du Yu felt a mix of emotions.

Would it have been better if he had only said half of that? The earlier words were so impactful, but that last sentence was just unnecessary. Senior, this really undermines your own prestige!

But soon, Du Yu realized he had overthought it.

The senior truly never disappointed him.

Because what was said was of no importance.

What mattered was what was done.

The青-clad figure, carrying the wine gourd, had already stomped down hard enough to collapse half of the dock and charged forward before the lake lord Yin Hou even had the chance to utter a harsh word.

The surging waters on the shore receded accordingly.

A river god clad in azure armor, wielding a long blade, surged forward to meet the enemy.

With just a single punch.

The armor, the body, the golden form, all shattered in an instant.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 588: The Sword Immortal in the Hands of the Sword Immortal (Part 1)

As the guest in the blue robe shattered the golden body of the Zao Creek Canal Master, the Lord of Cangjun Lake wore a furious expression, as if he might erupt into violence at any moment, even willing to leave the water to engage in battle. 

However, when that person smashed the golden body of a river deity with a single punch, Lord Yin of the lake instead became calm, his demeanor tranquil. Facing the foreigner who seemed to charge through the ranks like a lone rider, Lord Yin raised his hand, fingers aligned. Two strands of spiritual light, one pale gold and the other a deep green, coiled around his fingertips like small snakes, intertwining. With a gentle shake, the surface of Cangjun Lake became enveloped in rising mist, a rolling azure smoke that instantly covered an area of a hundred feet.

Over at the dock, let alone the disciples of Ghostly Axe Palace such as Du Yu, even Yan Qing, who was focusing his energy and concentrating, could see nothing but a vast expanse of mist. The figures of Lord Yin and the many civil and military officials of Cangjun Lake had vanished. Their ancestral master from Baodong Wonderland seemed to have summoned a treasured item from his sect, a flickering light surrounding all his fellow disciples, as they began to slowly retreat, presumably leaving the battlefield entirely to Lord Yin.

At the edge of the water mist, a pale gold giant python and a deep green serpent twisted and turned, their tails entwined as they flew like dragons that bring clouds and rain, thickening the mist on the lake's surface.

Yan Qing understood that this was one of the innate divine abilities of a water deity who had attained the Dao. It was more than just a simple illusion; it was like a cage resembling a rune formation. Once a cultivator or a martial artist was trapped within, it could consume both their spiritual energy (Qi) and pure true energy, making it a technique that could attack and defend simultaneously.

Du Yu remained stationary, glancing at the chaotic dock, which was in ruins, save for the bamboo box and the hiking staff, which still lay intact. 

“Truly the work of a celestial,” he mused.

What did this imply? It suggested that the senior’s foot had yet to unleash its full power.

Yan Qing waved her sleeve, dispelling the dust at the dock. 

Yet her gaze remained fixed on the movement across the surface of Cangjun Lake, where the vast mist array suddenly shrank as if pulled by an unseen hand, condensing to just over ten feet in size. The mist became thicker, and the pale gold python and the deep green serpent darted directly into the formation.

Yan Qing sighed inwardly. After all, this battle on Cangjun Lake had favored Lord Yin, who had the advantage of time and place, and a trusted river deity using their life as a sacrifice to hold back the foreigner’s advance. Losing the initiative would surely worsen the foreigner’s situation. 

Lord Yin had withstood for a thousand years in the Silver Screen Kingdom, standing tall as a water deity on par with the mountain lords of the five great peaks, so it was no wonder that their ancestral master chose the Dragon Palace as the final resting place during their journey.

Yan Qing glanced at Du Yu, noticing his calm demeanor.

Du Yu caught her gaze and smiled, “A mere pond cannot trap my brother Chen, who could flip rivers and seas with just a sneeze.”

Yan Qing couldn’t help but snicker. 

Such nauseating flattery! After the battle, let’s see if you can still say that.

The disciples from Baodong Wonderland had already retreated over a hundred feet from the battlefield. Master Fan Weiran had yet to dispel the divine abilities of the mountain-protecting treasure, and a golden glow emanated from the crown atop the elderly woman’s head, illuminating the surroundings. Beside her appeared an ethereal, veiled female official of the Heavenly Court, shimmering with golden radiance, her figure graceful. This ghostly golden handmaiden waved a celestial umbrella, sheltering all disciples from Baodong Wonderland, while the surface of the lake beneath Master Fan had already frozen, creating a temporary dock for them to stand upon.

Yan Qing breathed a sigh of relief. 

It seemed the master had no intention of intervening in the fighting tonight.

Lord Yin remained in his position, but only two river deities had led their people away, heading homeward. The Zao Creek Canal Master seemed to have been granted a pardon, his face barely hiding his elation as he used his divine abilities to transform into a cloud of mist, quickly flying back towards the Zao Creek Canal.

Yan Qing understood that the Cangjun Lake was preparing to mobilize its forces to eradicate that foreigner completely.

Lord Yin still had the leisurely demeanor to smile slightly at Yan Qing.

She chose to ignore him.

Strange phenomena arose on the lake.

The array that enveloped the lake suddenly revealed a golden thread, and the water formation exploded with a thunderous sound, dissolving like ice melting into water, all merging into the lake.

The guest in the blue robe stood with one hand behind his back, fingers aligned, facing Lord Yin while turning his back to the dock.

He pinched a golden talisman made of celestial material, igniting only a small portion of it.

Yan Qing was perplexed.

Was this merely a barrier-breaking talisman?

Could there truly be such a powerful barrier-breaking talisman in the world?

Not only did it shatter Lord Yin’s formation, but from the direction of Yan Qing and Du Yu at the dock, they also saw the foreigner’s hand behind his back, gently clenched into a fist, revealing the tails of the pale gold and deep green snakes.

Seeing this, Lord Yin showed no signs of surprise and smiled, “Just an appetizer from Cangjun Lake for our guest. How does it taste?”

Chen Ping’an surveyed his surroundings. The two river deities and the Zao Creek Canal Master had likely returned to their respective territories, starting from the three river sources, continuously flowing downstream to aid Lord Yin in setting a proper killing formation.

If not for the disturbance outside, Chen Ping’an would have been content to remain within the formation, simply enjoying the coolness and moonlight. After all, the two serpents of water that Lord Yin possessed, after a bit of refinement, were not something the Zao Creek Canal Master could compare to with the meager four ounces of water essence he produced. Weighing them, they were at least a pound each. Truly, he was a lake lord; his depth far surpassed that of a mere canal master.

Chen Ping’an temporarily abandoned the idea of thoroughly refining the two water serpents, and the two glimmers in his hands instantly vanished, confined outside the Water Palace Gate.

If there truly were any hidden schemes that might cause him a bit of trouble physically or spiritually, he would count that as Lord Yin's ability and accept it as a minor setback.

Within the small world of his body’s Qi domain, the two water serpents coiled outside the Water Palace Gate, trembling uncontrollably.

A rampaging fire dragon raised its head high, coldly looking down at these two insignificant creatures. One of its claws lightly brushed the ground; if not for the familiar aura of refinement emanating from them, one swipe would have been fatal.

The Water Palace Gate opened and then abruptly shut.

It turned out that two green-robed boys had taken the golden python and deep green serpent and fled.

The fire dragon, which was purely manifested from martial energy, slowly turned its massive body away and departed leisurely.

Lord Yin of the lake opened his palm, revealing a fragment of golden body—the remnants of the fallen river deity of Muhan River.

There was also a larger piece, which, after the punch, had burst forth, shooting out two fragments the size of a thumb. One of these had already been snatched by the guest in the blue robe. If not for Lord Yin’s quick action, that fragment of golden essence would likely have ended up in the foreigner’s possession as well.

Lord Yin gently shook his head, sighing. The river deity of Muhan River, although the weakest among the three river deities, was the most loyal, having followed him for a long time. He had both the qualifications of the Zao Creek Canal Master and the understanding of the Zao Creek deity. It was a pity that he had died, leaving behind only this fragment of his golden body. If only he had that slightly larger piece, it might have added a hundred years of cultivation.

The fragment of golden body sank into Lord Yin’s palm. He planned to refine it slowly after the battle—this was indeed an unexpected joy.

What did it matter that he had lost a so-called general? Turning back to request an official title from the emperor of the Silver Screen Kingdom was all that was needed. After all, the left and right arms of this river deity had long been eager to usurp the position of river deity. Otherwise, how could the rare treasures that had appeared in his daughter’s boudoir have come about?

This river deity of Muhan River had secretly kept two talented maidens over the past century. With a golden nest hiding a beauty, if the Dragon Palace wanted to pursue the matter, it would hardly be worth it. It was only because their lake lord had a generous heart and didn't want to dampen the spirits of his soldiers.

Chen Ping’an glanced at the distant disciples from Baodong Wonderland, clearly intending to watch the tiger fight from a mountain. He felt somewhat helpless; it seemed that making a fortune was going to be a challenge. How could these celestial practitioners, who had just shared wine at the Dragon Palace banquet, suddenly turn their backs on him? Couldn’t they toss a few magical artifacts his way to test the waters?

Chen Ping’an had no intention of forming any deep enmity with these celestial practitioners.

Cangjun Lake, on the other hand, was different.

The proactive malice of a water deity, causing trouble in one area, was a completely different situation from the indifference of cultivators towards the mortal realm.

Seeing that the foreigner had gone silent, Lord Yin asked, "Are you considering a truce?"

Chen Ping’an replied, "Let’s wait until the main course is served."

Lord Yin laughed heartily, "Very well! A straightforward person!"

Chen Ping’an narrowed his eyes.

Having presided over the water currents of Cangjun Lake for a thousand years, controlling a territory as vast as the small vassal states of Beiju Luzhou, it was likely that he had been looking down on mortals like this for many years. Having become a deity and attained the status of water god, he probably hadn’t shed a tear in his entire life.

The lake surface didn’t ripple at all.

Yet a green figure appeared before Lord Yin.

Wearing a luxurious purple dragon robe, Lord Yin hesitated for a moment but chose not to dodge, intending to test the power of the "Sword Immortal" before him.

He extended a hand to block in front of him.

That “purple” dragon robe was a ceremonial robe painstakingly crafted with a large amount of celestial money, a genuine magical artifact. In both Huangyue City and Baodong Wonderland, it was a top-tier celestial treasure. The so-called foundation of a sect is often measured by the number of magical artifacts they possess; for this lake lord and the mountain deities, it was determined by how many legitimate divine positions they held to place their trusted subordinates.

What a heavy force.

The undulating dragon on the robe instantly burst apart.

Lord Yin was forced to slide back several feet.

Could this possibly be a martial arts grandmaster at the Golden Body level? Was the title of "Sword Immortal" just a ruse to confuse everyone at the water deity’s shrine?

Yet Lord Yin remained unfazed, raising his hand again to receive another punch. This time, two water serpents on his body erupted, but what is a robe? This purple garment, born from spiritual energy, could gather and disperse at will. Even if a couple of its dragons were temporarily destroyed, it could still instantly reconstruct its golden body without harming the essence of the Dao. If these two punches were all this foreigner had to offer, Lord Yin was confident he could endure over a hundred more punches. When the time came, he would see whether the extraordinary nature of his robe or the foreigner's pure martial energy would prevail.

The third punch was upon him.

At once, two wandering dragons on the sleeves of his robe exploded.

Lord Yin’s expression grew grave.

He was considering whether to activate his divine abilities to escape. After all, it was unnecessary for a lake lord of such high status, equivalent to an emperor of the mortal realm, to personally take risks when the combined force of the two rivers and one canal had already been established. If not for wanting to showcase the authority of the lake lord in front of the celestial Yan Qing, getting close to this person on the surface of Cangjun Lake would be akin to reaching for the heavens.

Having hovered a few feet above the lake, after being struck back by one punch, Lord Yin lightly stepped on the water, smiling slightly, filled with sarcasm.

Another punch came.

The sound echoed like a deep bell.

Just as Lord Yin left Cangjun Lake, he was sent crashing back into the water.

Although Lord Yin was not physically harmed, he felt deeply humiliated by these two punches.

Then beneath the lake.

A series of dull rumblings erupted beneath the waters of Cangjun Lake.

The lake surged.

As the waves approached the golden handmaiden holding the umbrella, they seemed to be stopped by towering city walls, turning to foam, the waves crashing against each other, blocked by the golden light, like countless white pearls scattering.

“Come ashore to watch the battle,” Fan Weiran said.

The ice layer beneath the crowd rose into the air, swiftly heading towards the dock.

The old woman spoke with authority in Baodong Wonderland; no cultivator dared to voice any dissent.

Only that eccentric Second Ancestor, who was Yan Qing's mentor, dared to clash with Fan Weiran in a few words.

As the ice layer neared the dock, it suddenly dissipated without Fan Weiran's spiritual energy to guide it, melting into the lake.

The cultivators floated down gently alongside Master Fan, arriving at the nearly ruined dock.

As this group of celestial practitioners approached the dock, Du Yu gritted his teeth, his toes barely touching the ground as he darted towards the bamboo box and hiking staff, hand resting on the hilt of his waist knife.

Fan Weiran only glanced at the disciple from Ghostly Axe Palace, then passed by him.

The golden handmaiden accompanying them exchanged a knowing look with Du Yu.

Du Yu's teeth were clenched, standing still beside the hiking staff, unmoving.

This tall woman was the second-in-command among the cultivators of ten nations.

She was nearly equal in strength to the lord of Huangyue City, the first-in-command.

Moreover, Fan Weiran was known for her fiery temperament; back in the day, when she hadn’t yet become the door master of Baodong Wonderland, every time she led a group down the mountain to travel, it was guaranteed that several cultivators would die. As for the unfortunate martial artists, they were even more numerous. Fan Weiran enjoyed torturing her enemies; there was once a six-stage martial master from the rivers and lakes who offended a disciple of Baodong Wonderland, and after she subdued him with a magical artifact, she just stood next to him and stomped him into a pile of flesh.

Fan Weiran lifted her hand, lightly tapping her golden crown, and all the golden light flowed back into the crown, causing the golden handmaiden and the umbrella in her hand to vanish.

Yan Qing bowed, “Yan Qing pays respects to the Ancestor.”

Fan Weiran’s expression was kind as she gently poked Yan Qing’s forehead, feigning anger, “You little girl, how dare you walk alongside such a vicious outsider?”

Yan Qing stood there, speechless and embarrassed.

Fan Weiran turned to gaze at Cangjun Lake, communicating through the rippling waters of her heart, “The good show is about to begin. To be able to beat Lord Yin to the point where his body’s illusion is completely shattered and his true form appears must mean this is undoubtedly a grandmaster at the Golden Body level. Such a rare sight! The martial world of over a dozen nations down the mountain hasn’t seen a legendary Golden Body martial artist in two hundred years. Yan girl, when facing this person, be sure to take care, never let yourself get close. Don’t be foolish like Lord Yin, who is overconfident; you’ll surely suffer for it. There’s no need to engage in a pure strength competition with a martial artist when you have magical techniques and artifacts at your disposal.”

Yan Qing nodded.

Fan Weiran continued, “Moreover, Lord Yin has a naturally strong body, not something we Qi practitioners can compare to; he’s a tough beast, with a thick hide and flesh.”

Suddenly, a gigantic serpent over a hundred feet long appeared on the lake, now sprouting four claws, raising its head high and opening its massive jaws to unleash a beam of green light onto the lake's surface.

The figure in the blue robe raised a hand, forcibly blocking that imposing beam.

That dazzling scene resembled a bright moon rising over the sea.

Yan Qing silently took in this vivid image.

Fan Weiran scoffed, “A martial artist at the Golden Body level battling a Golden Body deity—how fitting, how fitting! It’s worth the trip.”

Meanwhile, at the mouth of the two rivers and one canal leading into the lake, three water dragons emerged, each dozens of feet long. Two of the yellow water dragons were larger, while the black water dragon was the smallest and most delicate.

These three water dragons, governed by the golden bodies of the river deities, had eyes that shimmered with a faint golden hue.

Not only did three water dragons appear, but the entire network of waterways under Cangjun Lake began to tremble and twist, coming under the command of Lord Yin and the three golden body deities from one canal and two rivers.

This night on Cangjun Lake, the flood truly surged, with towering waves reaching the sky.

The majestic battlefield continued to move away from the dock, heading towards the heart of Cangjun Lake.

One of Fan Weiran’s direct disciples, a female cultivator, giggled softly, “Master, this fellow is quite sensible, afraid that a splash might hit you, so he’s moving far away.”

Another tall male cultivator chimed in, “A wise man knows when to retreat; he has already thoroughly angered Lord Yin, and his life is uncertain. To offend the Ancestor would be courting death.”

Du Yu, feeling like a thorn in the back, stood like a wooden post at the dock’s forefront.

He felt as insignificant as the lush green hiking staff beside him.

A lofty celestial like Yan Qing could make him and Ghostly Axe Palace suffer greatly, let alone a mountain-top cultivator like Fan Weiran.

The old woman stepping atop Ghostly Axe Palace was akin to a mountain pressing down on them.

Fan Weiran turned her head and laughed, “Yan girl, no need to be reserved; just step forward.”

Only then did the dutiful Yan Qing take a step forward to stand beside her ancestor.

Fan Weiran’s expression was relaxed, but within her heart, she was not as carefree as she appeared.

Some matters, even if Lord Yin had relatively high cultivation, he would still be blind if he did not stand at the right position.

The old woman raised her head and gazed at the night sky.

Only she and Ye Han, the lord of Huangyue City, could see the faint glimmers of unusual light.

Thus, her junior sister had always worried that she might harbor ill feelings towards her proud disciple, Yan Qing, or even secretly obstruct her path to enlightenment. This was why she took precautions against her sister, as if guarding against a thief.

Fan Weiran found it somewhat amusing.

A girl with a naive appearance suddenly said softly, “Master, that person seems to just be practicing punches, deliberately using those snakes and pythons to temper his own physique.”

Fan Weiran beckoned her over, and the girl skipped to stand beside the elder, raising her head innocently and saying, “Really, Master, I’m not lying to you.”

The tall Fan Weiran bent slightly, ruffling the girl’s hair. Looking down at the girl’s beautiful eyes that shimmered faintly with light, she smiled, “My little Cui girl is exceptionally gifted as well; perhaps when you grow up, you could be like your Aunt Yan, a celebrated fairy wherever you go.”

Yan Qing smiled slightly at the girl.

The girl glanced at Yan Qing, her hands twisting together, lowering her head shyly, “I’m not as pretty as Aunt Yan.”

Fan Weiran laughed heartily.

The girl blushed even more.

Yan Qing gently pinched the girl's ear.

This was a rare display of affection from Yan Qing.

After the laughter subsided, Fan Weiran gazed at Cangjun Lake, her expression turning serious as she said, “Then we must carefully consider this.”

The signs of decline in a sect often begin with a lack of succession.

This point was clear in Huangyue City, where they still had He Lu to hold the fort, but Baodong Wonderland was even better.

In addition to Yan Qing, there was this Cui girl, along with her already-secluded eldest disciple, who would all be the pillars of Baodong Wonderland in the future.

Yan Qing’s heart trembled.

Why did it seem that this person, who clearly held back, prompted Master Fan, who had initially decided to watch from the sidelines, to instead harbor intentions of killing?

On Cangjun Lake, an island was being plowed through by the true form of Lord Yin, resembling a massive snake.

The figure in the blue robe had only been retreating with each punch, protecting himself while lacking offensive power.

Seeing that he had no more ability to retaliate, after shattering the golden body of the river deity of Muhan River and forcing Lord Yin to reveal his true form, it seemed he was on the verge of exhaustion.

This made the three water dragons from the two rivers and one canal, which had initially been hiding, fight with increasing zeal.

In the distance, Lord Yin’s shout echoed, “Fan Ancestor, if you help me kill this scoundrel, I will give Baodong Wonderland that purple ceremonial robe!”

Fan Weiran smiled without speaking.

Yan Qing raised her gaze, even as she circulated her incantation to harness the spiritual energy of the Qi domain, causing her eyes to emit a purple glow, manifesting the signs of a perfected technique, she still struggled to see clearly. The battlefield was too far from the dock; she could only see the tumultuous shadows of the serpents.

Although Cui girl possessed a natural ability to perceive some obscure truths, Yan Qing remained skeptical that a legendary Golden Body martial artist from the rivers and lakes could still handle the combined assault of several deities on Lord Yin’s territory with such ease. If they fought on land, without the advantage of the lake, Yan Qing would be slightly more convinced.

Moreover, a purely martial artist, once their true energy was exhausted, would face a grim fate if not given a chance to recover their breath.

How long had they been fighting now?

Or was it that a martial artist at the Golden Body level possessed a body capable of enduring an endless stream of true energy, potentially reaching the realm of the indestructible golden body of Buddhism, able to withstand Lord Yin and the three water dragons’ combined offense?

In the distance, Lord Yin’s voice rumbled like distant thunder from the dock, “Fan Weiran! I’ll add another position for the river deity of Muhan River to give to you all at Baodong Wonderland!”

Fan Weiran replied loudly, “If I’m not mistaken, it seems the Zao Creek Canal Master has also perished?”

On Cangjun Lake, apart from the earth-shattering waves, there were no further words from Lord Yin.

Although Yan Qing paid little attention to mortal affairs, the territory of Cangjun Lake was merely a collection of three rivers and two canals; yielding a position of a river deity could be considered sufficient sincerity. If another position for the river deity of Zao Creek were to be surrendered, and considering Zao Creek was already in disarray, if Lord Yin really agreed, it would be like driving two stakes into his own eyes and flesh. With two legitimate deities from one canal and one river, and with Baodong Wonderland as their backing, Lord Yin would completely lose the authority to kill at will; he knew full well that one cannot sleep peacefully beside one’s own mattress. 

Moreover, it would involve the fundamental essence of the Dao; dividing the abundant water and mountain energy of Cangjun Lake would not be something Yan Qing would agree to lightly.

Yan Qing asked telepathically, “Ancestor, are we really going for two positions of water deity in Cangjun Lake at once?”

Fan Weiran smiled, “There’s no need to raise the stakes. Even if Lord Yin obediently hands over the position of the river deity of Muhan River, he will still harbor resentment. With Lord Yin’s cunning and prowess, he will certainly suppress the new river deity into a useless being. Baodong Wonderland doesn’t have the luxury to listen to a river deity from another realm complain every day; when that time comes, will we still be concerned?”

Yan Qing nodded, “The Ancestor sees far.”

Fan Weiran grasped Yan Qing’s delicate, pale hand, one hand holding it while lightly patting the back of her hand, sighing, “Yan girl, you’ve heard enough about these mundane matters; just focus on your cultivation, nurturing your spirit and potential, and realize the Dao.”

Yan Qing acknowledged softly.

Fan Weiran released her hand, confident, “Perhaps the harvest will exceed my expectations.”

Sure enough.

Within half a joss stick’s time, Lord Yin shouted once more, “Fan Ancestor, I’ll give you the position of the Zao Creek Canal Master as well! If you still do not agree, then our friendship with Baodong Wonderland’s disciples will be severed completely!”

This shout was no longer steady as before; instead, it was filled with rage, obviously somewhat desperate.

Fan Weiran smiled slightly and whispered to Yan Qing, “What do you think?”

Yan Qing’s expression was complex as she replied softly, “Ancestor, please be careful.”

“Yan girl, you probably don’t know how the last Golden Body martial artist in the history of these dozen nations met his end. When we return to the sect, you can ask your master; that was a renowned battle between my junior sister and the lord of Huangyue City.”

Fan Weiran laughed as she transformed into a rainbow and soared towards Cangjun Lake.

Yan Qing frowned.

Du Yu still stood honestly in place, silently praying to the gods.

As the rainbow above soared towards Cangjun Lake, Du Yu felt his presence was of little significance; however, if he had three joss sticks in hand, he would indeed plant them into the ground.

On a nearly flattened small island.

The massive true form of Lord Yin circled slowly around the island.

The two river deities' water dragons had become bloodthirsty, frantically attacking the figure in the blue robe.

Meanwhile, the black water dragon controlled by the Zao Creek Canal Master floated on the surface of the lake, hidden within the canal master’s guise on a mat, the canal master’s face pale, feeling as if all her bones were about to shatter.

The two nearby river deities stood on the mat, eyes closed in concentration, golden light swirling around them, as waves of dragon palace water essence flowed into their golden bodies.

Yet, with the disguise present, they could draw on the abundant water essence of the dragon palace, while the true golden bodies of the three river deities had fully merged into the three water dragons.

One of the water dragons charged its massive head toward the blue-robed guest.

But it was met by a hand that firmly blocked its advance.

The guest smiled, “Are you feeling a bit tired? Allow me to take over.”

Chen Ping’an produced a jade talisman crafted by the Chongxuan Bureau, already reciting the incantation, and tossed it into the sky.

It radiated a brilliant light.

As if a great sun illuminated the dark world.

Due to not intentionally pursuing a broad range, the confinement directed at this island became even more solid and unyielding.

One of the water dragons, transformed from a river deity, attempted to shake its head and retreat.

The hand that had previously blocked its head twisted slightly with the step taken by the guest in the blue robe, slicing forward like a blade.

A line was drawn, opening up the water dragon from head to belly.

When Chen Ping’an stood firm, he now held a slightly larger fragment of a golden body.

The transformed river deity’s guise within the dragon palace instantly withered, turning to ash.

The other water dragon first appeared dazed, then began to flee in a panic. However, when it crashed into the dazzling barrier of light, its head shattered with a few cracks. Enduring the immense pain, it attempted to burrow into the ground to escape, believing that if it could reach the water, there was a chance of survival. 

But the next moment, it felt as if struck heavily on its head, sliding forward against the island’s surface, carving a deep trench as it went.

Above the water dragon’s head, the blue-robed guest’s fist came crashing down.

The entire small island trembled, sending up countless dust clouds, while the previously surging lake water now surged backward.

Another fragment of a river deity’s golden body was clenched tightly in his hand.

Looking again, Lord Yin had actually vanished.

This was expected; it was a strategy of taking them down one by one. If Lord Yin had entered the area of the talisman formation, there was an even more valuable talisman waiting in his sleeve, perfectly serving Chen Ping’an’s purpose.

Out of the corner of his eye, Chen Ping’an caught sight of the black water dragon feigning death on the lake surface. With a flick of its tail, it plunged into the water, splashing up a great deal of spray.

Chen Ping’an clapped the sword gourd, and the flying sword, Fifteen, shot out.

He turned his gaze towards the direction Lord Yin had fled.

The sword at his back emerged two or three inches from its sheath.

Chen Ping’an narrowed his eyes, staring at the gathering dark clouds, and spoke in a low voice, “Let’s go back!”

The sword immortal clanged back into its sheath.

It seemed even a bit resentful.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 589: The Sword Immortal in the Hands of the Sword Immortal (Part Two)

Chen Ping'an slightly swayed backward, but for now, he chose not to hold it against the sword. 

He reached out and grasped the Jade Clarity Brightness Talisman, noting that most celestial talismans have one flaw: it's easy to open the door, but hard to close it. Once the talisman’s core is activated, the brilliance will scatter through the heavens and earth, and the cultivator can only slow down the shattering of the core and the loss of spiritual energy, but cannot completely stop a high-grade talisman from burning out. However, this particular talisman, once its door is closed, will remain usable even if it becomes a drafty residence, as long as it’s not activated again; enduring for a span of ten days should be manageable.

The lake lord of Cangyun Lake had his own methods to make him obediently come ashore to do business with him, but that would require a bit of time. However, the more likely scenario was that he would voluntarily come ashore. Bad people who have lived long and climbed high tend not to be foolish, which is quite frustrating.

As for the fifteen flying swords, they simply followed and tracked the Master of Shao Creek, with no intention of killing.

With a rough idea of the location of the Dragon Palace beneath the lake, the capital for business only increased.

Chen Ping'an turned his gaze toward the sky and smiled, asking, “What brings you here, old lady? Afraid I won’t know how to swim and can't return to the dock?”

The matriarch Fan Weiran was filled with rage. This Lake Lord Yin Hou had actually run off, making her take the blame! If she hadn't sensed that she was about to arrive, this unfathomable young man would certainly not have stopped and given up on pursuing Yin Hou.

Well, he had previously dared to boast about being on bad terms with the cultivators of Baoding Immortal Realm. In a hundred years, I’ll see whether the waters of Cangyun Lake are deep or if the techniques of our Baoding Immortal Realm disciples are higher. Just in time, my junior sister is destined to have no hope of breaking through, so let her bring people here to confront you lot from Cangyun Lake for a hundred years!

Looking at the young man who spoke politely while his hands were hidden in his sleeves, two fingers pinched that fearsome talisman, revealing a glimmer of golden light.

Fan Weiran hovered on the wind at the junction between the island and Cangyun Lake, casting a glance at the vermilion wine flask tied to his waist, and smiled, “Indeed, a sword immortal, and so young, truly astonishing.”

Chen Ping'an took down the Sword Nurturing Gourd, took a sip of water, wiped his mouth, and smiled, “My brother Du Yu has told me a whole basket of filthy stories about Cangyun Lake along the way. When it comes to your Baoding Immortal Realm, he speaks with genuine respect and admiration, so I won’t hold tonight's events against you, old lady. Otherwise, watching such a good show would require some expenditure.”

Fan Weiran sneered inwardly.

Suddenly, she realized the young man was staring at her intently. He slowly said, “So please leave.”

Fan Weiran's expression darkened, her sleeves billowing, making a rustling sound.

Fan Weiran suddenly smiled, “There’s still plenty of time ahead. I wish this little foreign sword immortal a pleasant journey, with favorable winds and smooth sailing. If you are willing, you can visit our Baoding Immortal Realm as a guest.”

Then she asked a rather strange question, “Is your ancestral temple solid?”

Fan Weiran could at least tell this was not a compliment, but once she made up her mind, she had no hesitation, smiling, “In the future, the little sword immortal will know upon meeting.”

The old woman returned to the dock on the wind.

Chen Ping'an looked up at the thick black clouds that had yet to dissipate.

Aside from the impact of Lake Lord Yin Hou’s true body, which was somewhat manageable, the collisions of the three water dragons hardly contributed to physical enhancement.

Chen Ping'an stowed the Sword Nurturing Gourd, stood for a moment, then lightly pressed his toes down and leaped out of the island's territory, stepping onto the surface of Cangyun Lake. His form transformed into a wisp of azure smoke, repeatedly skimming the water surface toward the dock.

When Chen Ping'an landed at the dock, the old woman and the cultivators of Baoding Immortal Realm had already left.

Du Yu still wore the divine armor of sweet dew, one hand resting on his sword, standing in place as a guardian for the bamboo box, conical hat, and the travel staff.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “So loyal?”

Du Yu wiped his face vigorously; the wind and rain had made it somewhat stiff. After rubbing, he squinted and rubbed his hands together, his smile brightening.

It wasn't that he didn't want to say a few flattering words, but Du Yu racked his brain and couldn’t come up with a suitable compliment. He felt that the nice words he had prepared didn't match the extraordinary demeanor of this senior.

Chen Ping'an smoothed out his rolled-up sleeve, re-donning his conical hat, adjusted his bamboo box, and drew out his travel staff.

Just as Du Yu was about to move, he suddenly found his legs a bit numb.

His role as the little guardian of Ghost Axe Palace could be considered diligent; he had at least put in some effort, if not merit.

Senior, you are a wise old immortal at the mountain’s peak; you must consider me a little.

Chen Ping'an walked ahead while Du Yu quickly stowed away the sweet dew armor, turning it into a military talisman and tucking it into his sleeve. He hurried to catch up with his senior and quietly asked, “Senior, since we've successfully repelled the water gods of Cangyun Lake and driven away the cultivators of Baoding Immortal Realm, what’s next? Should we smash the shrines of the two river gods, or go to Suijia City to snatch some treasures?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “We?”

As for whether “repelled” was an accurate description, he didn’t feel like explaining.

Du Yu chuckled, completely unashamed.

However, maintaining the right amount of restraint was still necessary, so Du Yu soon stopped his chatter.

After walking for a while, Du Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Senior, are we headed to the water god temple of Master Shao Creek?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I want to rest there for a few days, waiting for the lake lord to come ashore and discuss business with me.”

Du Yu responded with an “oh,” not daring to ask further.

Returning along the path to the water god temple, all the servants and attendants in the manor, whether ghosts or living beings, had scattered like monkeys fleeing from a fallen tree.

Chen Ping'an arrived at the inner courtyard door, which hung a plaque reading “Green Waters Flowing.” He stored it among his belongings. Although Master Shao Creek had already perished, this unusual plaque still contained some spiritual energy of water, likely making it the most valuable item in the temple.

Chen Ping'an removed the bamboo box and conical hat, sitting on the lowest step, instructing Du Yu to light a bonfire in the courtyard.

He began practicing the sword furnace stance.

After the great battle, recuperation was essential; otherwise, lingering effects could become a long-term hazard.

Furthermore, Chen Ping'an also needed to use introspection to see if the two water-circulating golden pythons and azure snakes, which hadn’t been fully refined, could truly benefit the water palace.

Du Yu sat cross-legged beside the bonfire, cautiously glancing at the senior's seated posture. He had no grand thoughts. Cultivating celestial techniques wasn’t just about having a proper stance.

Moreover, given this senior’s status, he would surely possess an extremely advanced technique. Even if the entire set of incantations were imparted, he might not be able to learn it.

A streak of firefly light filled the night sky, diving into the senior’s wine flask.

Du Yu silently reminded himself that the strange was to be expected.

About an hour passed, during which Du Yu added a few dry branches to the fire.

Then he noticed that when the senior opened his eyes, he seemed to be in a good mood, a smile on his face.

Chen Ping'an glanced up.

The heavy clouds that had almost engulfed the entire Cangyun Lake had dissipated.

The full moon hung in the sky.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Du Yu, do you think the customs and traditions accumulated over thousands of years in Cangyun Lake can be changed by anyone?”

Du Yu boldly replied, “Unless from top to bottom, from the lake lord to the water gods of the three rivers and two channels, everyone is replaced, especially the lake lord of Cangyun Lake must be the first to go; then there might be a chance. However, to accomplish such a feat, it would require a peak cultivator like you to personally intervene and spend at least several decades here, keeping a close watch. Otherwise, in my opinion, changing it would be worse than not changing it at all. In fact, Lake Lord Yin Hou is not a bad overlord; those floods and droughts he orchestrates are merely to recruit a few high-quality maidens for the Dragon Palace. Each time a few hundred commoners die, he encounters some foolish mountain and water deities who can't even control their life-saving techniques, and suddenly, thousands die. If he gets angrier, triggering conflicts between mountains and rivers or making enemies with colleagues within his territory, that would truly make the common people suffer, leaving thousands starving. After wandering the jianghu for so many years, I’ve seen plenty of mountain and water deities, city gods from various regions, and land spirits picking and choosing who to care about; the common people are entirely disregarded. The prominent families in the mountains, the martial arts masters who establish schools, and the relatives of officials in the capital—these are the ones they focus on winning over.”

Chen Ping'an glanced at Du Yu.

Du Yu looked innocent, “Senior, I'm just speaking the truth. It’s not like I’m the one doing these bad things. To put it bluntly, the little dirty deeds I, Du Yu, have done in the jianghu cannot compare to the filth dug out from the fingernails of Lake Lord Yin Hou or Master Shao Creek. I know you don’t like our kind of heartless celestial practices, but I, Du Yu, can only speak my heart in front of you, and I wouldn’t dare to deceive you even a little.”

Chen Ping'an smiled.

Du Yu didn’t try to climb the ranks; he didn’t think he had truly caught the eye of this mountain-top old immortal and could rely on the tiger’s might to scare off the dogs.

He certainly wouldn’t be foolish enough to kill himself with a single move.

Du Yu had some discernment.

Perhaps this was what a true peak cultivator was—truly merciless on the path of the Dao.

Du Yu had actually looked up at the moon earlier with some melancholy; he couldn’t understand why, after traveling the jianghu so many times over the years, it was the first time he felt some concern for his parents.

However, at this moment, the senior opened his eyes, and he had to perk up and cautiously handle the senior's seemingly casual inquiries.

Let this be a tempering of his mindset. His parents often said that cultivating one's heart wasn’t that important. Whether it was the teachings of the sect or the exhortations of the masters to their disciples, they were just formalities. The treasures of immortals, the magical items at hand, and the fundamental techniques of the Dao were the three most important things. But still, a bit of heart cultivation was necessary.

Du Yu mustered his courage and asked, “Senior, how did the battle go over Cangyun Lake?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “As you said, we merely repelled them. Harmony brings wealth, after all.”

Du Yu felt that it wasn’t quite that straightforward.

However, he no longer had the courage to dig deeper.

His courage and spirit for the latter half of his life had nearly been exhausted by tonight’s events.

What kind of heroic demeanor would qualify me, Du Yu, as a true man?

Subsequently, Chen Ping'an began to focus on practicing the sword furnace stance.

Du Yu then began to meditate using the secret incantations of Ghost Axe Palace, breathing and refining his energy.

At dawn, Chen Ping'an stood up and began practicing the six-step stance, telling the hurriedly waking Du Yu, “Go check the Master Shao Creek water god temple to see if there are any valuable items.”

Du Yu nodded, preparing to take a chance and see if he could find a magical item or a few small summer coins for his senior.

But the senior suddenly remarked, “When I say valuable, I mean a single snowflake coin.”

Du Yu was momentarily stunned, mistakenly thinking he misheard, and cautiously asked, “Senior, you mean that one small summer coin, right?”

Chen Ping'an replied helplessly, “With your hearing, it’s a wonder you’ve made it this far in the jianghu.”

Du Yu suddenly realized and began to scour the ground. With the senior beside him, he felt he could dig three feet into the ground, even if it was an abandoned river goddess temple, let alone the Dragon Palace beneath the lake.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, merely practicing the stance.

Until midday, Du Yu returned, carrying two large bundles, fully loaded.

Chen Ping'an said, “The valuable bag belongs to me; the other one is yours.”

Du Yu looked forlorn, “Senior, what did I do wrong?”

Chen Ping'an continued practicing the stance, slowly saying, “There are rules to cultivation, rules to wandering the jianghu, and rules to doing business. Do you understand?”

Du Yu didn’t actually understand but pretended to, feeling anxious as he accepted one of the bags.

However, Du Yu thought for a moment, opened both bags, and transferred a few valuable items from his bag to the senior's.

Chen Ping'an didn’t stop him.

Chen Ping'an stopped his fists and leaped onto the highest building’s rooftop, gazing toward Suijia City.

Then, he practiced the stance atop the rooftops.

Du Yu was puzzled; no matter how he looked at it, the stance seemed more like a jianghu fighter’s boxing style rather than any celestial technique.

Du Yu was then greatly impressed.

This senior truly was different, returning to simplicity.

That evening, Du Yu lit the bonfire again. Chen Ping'an said, “Alright, go pursue your jianghu adventures. After staying in the shrine for a day and night, everyone observing has likely understood the situation.”

Du Yu felt a bit awkward.

His small intentions had indeed been noticed by the senior.

If they had immediately parted ways at the dock, Du Yu feared he wouldn’t be able to survive his journey to Suijia City.

After contemplating, Du Yu felt it was better to leave while he could, ready to take the burlap sack toward Suijia City.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an said, “Stay a little longer.”

Du Yu complied, putting down the sack, sitting cross-legged on the ground, and asked softly, “Senior, I actually know of a secret talisman from my sect that’s not inferior to the snow mud talisman or the camel monument talisman.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and waved his hand, saying, “Earlier, when your life was hanging by a thread, it was acceptable for you to engage in such unethical acts. Now that your life is no longer in danger, it’s not good to use the sect’s rules to embellish your own reputation. The path of cultivation first requires one to be a good person.”

Du Yu froze on the spot.

He glanced at the burlap sack on the ground.

It seemed only at that moment did he vaguely grasp a hint of a clue.

Du Yu clenched his fists, silent and contemplative.

Chen Ping'an stood up, and Du Yu instinctively rose but was pressed down by Chen Ping'an’s hand.

Du Yu turned to look, and after a moment, a familiar figure entered his sight.

Truly, she looked stunning from every angle.

No wonder she was Fairy Yan Qing.

Chen Ping'an frowned.

Du Yu felt a bit frightened. Senior, please don’t harm such a beautiful fairy. If such a stunning fairy were to perish, it would break my heart.

Yan Qing asked, “Since you’ve already killed the three river gods and channel masters in one go, why did you intentionally let that lake lord Yin Hou escape?”

Du Yu lost his balance and hurriedly reached out to steady himself.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Who gave you the audacity to keep looking for me?”

Yan Qing smiled and said, “A sword immortal who worries that the cloud sea falling will harm innocent people is truly a vicious killer? I, Yan Qing, am the first to not believe that.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Whether you believe it or not is none of my business. I’ll advise you one last time; my patience is limited.”

Yan Qing, however, walked directly toward the bonfire.

Du Yu had already shifted his position, able to observe the senior’s changing expressions while admiring the fairy’s beauty under the moonlight.

Then Du Yu’s mouth slowly dropped open.

A wisp of azure smoke darted toward the fairy dressed in white, and then Yan Qing seemed to be lifted like a chick, soaring onto a rooftop alongside the azure smoke.

The azure robe swirled in a circle on the rooftop, and the white-clothed beauty followed suit, spinning in a larger circle.

With a whoosh, Yan Qing vanished.

Chen Ping'an jumped down from the rooftop, returning to the steps to sit down.

Du Yu wiped his mouth and swallowed hard.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, “You can leave now.”

Du Yu was about to respectfully take his leave when he saw the senior suddenly show a hint of annoyance, rising into the air. The entire shrine shook with a commotion, reminiscent of the activity at the dock—what a scene of earth-shaking chaos.

Du Yu was in a dilemma, unsure whether to stay or go. It didn’t feel right not to at least say goodbye. If he didn’t leave, what if that senior suddenly took a liking to the delicate Yan Qing and returned with her hand in hand? Under the beautiful moonlight, the beauty would be even more enchanting...

Du Yu gave himself a slap.

He hoisted the burlap sack and began to run.

Just as he stepped out of the water god temple’s main door, he stood there dazed.

Perhaps it was this hurried journey that made the senior truly exert all his strength?

From behind the channel master’s water god temple to Cangyun Lake.

The figure in azure robe had long since disappeared, but the sound of thunder continued to resonate.

Du Yu sighed heavily.

Chen Ping'an landed at the dock, squinting.

That annoying young female cultivator from Baoding Immortal Realm had already been tossed into Cangyun Lake by him. She wasn’t seriously injured; at most, she experienced temporary suffocation and was a bit disheveled. 

However, knowing that the lake lord of Cangyun Lake was likely nearby, Chen Ping'an had no choice but to hurry over. Sure enough, after the girl fell into the lake, she vanished without a trace.

Chen Ping'an pinched the Jade Clarity Brightness Talisman between his fingers.

Just as he was about to throw the talisman, the water surface of Cangyun Lake burst open. The lake lord Yin Hou, dressed in a purple dragon robe, emerged, standing beside a seemingly recently freed young woman, who glared angrily at the azure-clad guest at the dock.

Yin Hou extended a hand with a smile, “Earlier, I was worried about Fairy Yan Qing's safety. In a moment of urgency, I slightly used a technique to try to ease the force with which the fairy entered the lake. I apologize for any offense; please come ashore, Fairy Yan Qing.”

Yan Qing’s expression was icy as she dispelled all residual water vapor from her body, floating down to the dock.

If that culprit hadn’t come to the dock, Yan Qing couldn’t imagine what her fate would have been.

Chen Ping'an glanced at her, “Not leaving yet? The tea at Master Shao Creek is nice. I can’t help you anymore, but if you think the waters of Cangyun Lake are good, I can assist.”

Yan Qing snorted coldly and soared away on the wind.

Chen Ping'an faced the alert Lake Lord Yin Hou, smiling, “You should know very well that if I were determined to kill you, it wouldn’t be difficult.”

Yin Hou nodded, “Indeed. So I’m curious why the sword immortal showed mercy.”

Chen Ping'an surveyed his surroundings, remaining silent.

Yin Hou’s feet remained submerged in the water.

Not only that, but the skies over Cangyun Lake and all the surrounding waters began to cloud ominously again.

Chen Ping'an asked, “What was the content of that confidential letter sent by the governor of Suijia City to the capital?”

Lake Lord Yin Hou answered without hesitation, “The content of the letter was nothing new. The sword immortal can likely guess; it was merely a hope that friends in the capital could help that governor continue to clear his name after death, at the very least finding an opportunity to make it public. However, there’s one thing the sword immortal probably didn’t expect: at the end of the letter, the governor candidly stated that if his friends never became high-ranking officials in their lifetime, they shouldn’t rush into this matter, lest a failed attempt at vindication leads to personal repercussions.”

Chen Ping'an conjured a wine jug from thin air, unsealing the clay, and took a slow sip.

Yin Hou continued with a smile, “I have some connections in the capital, and you understand my poor relationship with Suijia City. Having the Master of Shao Creek accompany me was simply to ensure that this confidential letter could be smoothly delivered to the capital. Furthermore, since I have some connections in the capital, I instructed the Master of Shao Creek that as long as that person was willing to vindicate him, they should help him navigate his career more smoothly. In truth, the attempt to truly vindicate him was futile; I merely wanted to irritate the city god temple of Suijia City and that fire god shrine. However, I didn’t expect that city god to act so decisively, directly killing a court official, a governor who could be considered a high-ranking official, and without an ounce of patience, not even allowing him to leave Suijia City. This was indeed problematic. However, that city god must have panicked and, without further thought, severed the roots. Later, I don’t know which channels leaked news that the Master of Shao Creek was in the capital, and the city god began to operate, commanding his confidants to send that half-formed incense small figure to the capital, handing it over to that person. That person, who hadn’t yet filled the vacancy as a jinshi, immediately agreed to the conditions of the Suijia City city god temple. By this point, I instructed the Master of Shao Creek to return to Cangyun Lake since distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors. It’s fine to make some small moves behind the scenes, but tearing the face would be unwise.”

Chen Ping'an abruptly asked an unrelated question, “As the lake lord, if you took a liking to a talented girl from the marketplace, why go through such trouble?”

Lake Lord Yin Hou smiled, “First, the common people are ignorant, fearing power but not virtue. Second, it’s not just my Dragon Palace that needs beautiful maidens; the three rivers and two channels need them as well. My subordinates also require them. In the territory of Cangyun Lake, if today there’s one less woman, tomorrow there’s another, over time, fearing power too much can be detrimental. The common folk can only resign to fate, but those from scholarly clans, wealthy families who can make their families escape, would spread the word. Year-round, living in fear—what do you think they would do? Naturally, they would move elsewhere. Over time, year after year, the fortune of Cangyun Lake would continue to drain away. But if Cangyun Lake established such an unspoken rule, it would be easier to appease the hearts of the people. Moreover, the Dragon Palace compensates generously to the families onshore; I won’t hide it from the sword immortal, many wealthy people would be eager for their daughters or granddaughters to catch the eye of the Dragon Palace.”

Lake Lord Yin Hou paused for a moment and sighed, “The best deals in the world are never those that provide sudden wealth but rather those that yield steady returns year after year. Don’t you agree, sword immortal?”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his thumb across his mouth and smiled, “This good reasoning, coming from the lake lord, has become twisted.”

Yin Hou smiled without a word.

Waiting for the other party to make an offer.

Regardless of how much hatred he felt for the person in front of him, since he was outmatched, the other could walk freely in his Cangyun Lake, while his own Dragon Palace could only endure in silence.

It was better to cut losses than to make a series of mistakes.

The former at least allows one to keep the green mountains, without worrying about firewood; the latter could often lead to a complete disaster overnight.

Chen Ping'an put away the wine jug, asking, “What about the decay of the city god’s golden body in Suijia City?”

Yin Hou, who visited tonight, was quite frank. Upon recalling this matter, he couldn’t hide his glee, saying, “That scholar who became governor not only unexpectedly bore a portion of the qi of the county city and the cultural luck of Yinping Kingdom early on, but the share was far beyond my and Suijia City’s imagination. In fact, if it weren’t for this, how could a mere child escape from Suijia City solely by his own efforts? Moreover, he had another romantic tale; initially, a princess from Yinping Kingdom fell in love with him at first sight, never forgetting him. To escape marriage, she became a Daoist nun, guarding her lamp alone. Although she had no aptitude for cultivation, she was after all a beloved princess. Inadvertently, she intertwined a strand of national fortune with that governor. Later, upon hearing the news of his misfortune in the capital’s Daoist temple, she resolutely ended her own life with a gold hairpin. The two factors combined led to that city god’s sin, directly causing a fatal crack in his golden body that could not be repaired with good deeds.”

Finally, Chen Ping'an asked, “What might be the outcome for Suijia City?”

Yin Hou glanced toward Suijia City, shaking his head, “Very grim. With a city god hoping to have a hundred households share his karma and endure a heavenly tribulation, it’s clear that no household has accumulated virtue. It won’t be long before the heavenly tribulation strikes; most of the ordinary scholars in Suijia City will likely perish. Therefore, those cultivators heading to Suijia City will leave before that happens; even if they can’t obtain any treasures, they won’t dare linger.”

Lake Lord Yin Hou originally thought he’d have to negotiate with the young azure-clad sword immortal tonight, but unexpectedly, the latter turned and walked away.

This made Yin Hou feel uneasy, but he also dared not approach the shore.

He could only endure his hatred and anger, along with an unsettling feeling, using his divine power to part the waters and return to the Dragon Palace beneath the lake.

Chen Ping'an returned to the water god temple of Master Shao Creek.

But he found that not only had Du Yu returned, but even Yan Qing was there.

This time, however, Chen Ping'an said nothing. He walked over to the bonfire, crouching down to warm himself.

Du Yu squatted beside him, saying, “I saw Fairy Yan Qing return earlier, and thinking about that burlap sack of treasures left in the courtyard without anyone guarding it, I couldn’t set my mind at ease, so I hurried back.”

Yan Qing had been standing on the steps inside the temple, gazing at the disciple of Ghost Axe Palace.

Du Yu had no particular impression of him before. He had only heard of him once or twice, mainly because his parents were a pair of Daoist partners on the mountain. He knew he was a person who bullied the weak and feared the strong, enjoying roaming the jianghu.

Yan Qing spoke, “I only ask one thing; once I’m done, I’ll leave.”

The man merely stared at the bonfire, lost in thought.

After a moment of silence, Yan Qing asked, “Why did you make a move against He Lu? If you say you heard some filthy tales about Cangyun Lake from Du Yu, and thus acted ruthlessly, that would be understandable. But you shouldn’t have encountered He Lu.”

Du Yu rolled his eyes, making a silly face.

Oh dear, so she’s here to plead for that pretty boy lover after all.

It’s only right he was tossed into Cangyun Lake by the senior to drink some water.

Yan Qing had prepared herself for the fact that this person would remain silent.

But unexpectedly, he slowly said, “The first words He Lu spoke to dissuade me were not for my sake, but to invite you for tea at the Master of Shao Creek.”

Yan Qing wasn’t foolish and naturally understood this matter.

The man continued, “Because He Lu felt that I was a cultivator with higher cultivation than the Master of Shao Creek.”

Yan Qing wanted to hear more, hesitating to sit on the top step.

But she was met with a sidelong glance from him.

Seeing the chilling gaze, Yan Qing immediately stopped, no longer making any additional movements.

The man suddenly withdrew his gaze, continuing to focus on the bonfire, falling silent once more.

He clearly hadn’t finished speaking, yet he had no intention of continuing.

Yan Qing felt humiliated and furious, feeling so insignificant that he couldn’t even spare a few more words.

A tremor ran through Yan Qing’s heart. Without further hesitation, she swiftly took to the wind and left.

Du Yu hesitated for a moment, then got up to take his leave as well.

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Chen Ping'an stared at the bonfire.

The truth is not only in the hands of the strong, nor is it solely in the weak's hands.

Truth is truth; it doesn’t become more because you are strong, nor does it disappear because you are weak.

But it seemed this was just Chen Ping'an’s understanding.

Not Du Yu’s, nor that of the young female cultivator named Yan Qing, nor that of the favored one, He Lu.

In the jianghu of Shushui Kingdom, there was still Song Yushao.

In the murky and chaotic Book Lake, there was still the ghostly general willing to draw his sword against his colleagues.

In the bone-laden and ghost-haunted Ghost Valley, there were still the swordsman Pu Rang and the sect leader Zhu Quan.

Here in Yinping Kingdom and Cangyun Lake, they had yet to encounter even one.

The realization of this made Chen Ping'an fall silent.

He understood this simple truth. Why wasn’t it a truth for them? Because it wouldn’t bring them any benefit; on the contrary, it would only make them feel burdened on the path of cultivation, making their actions feel unpleasant. Thus, they may not truly not understand, but rather that they couldn’t pretend not to understand. After all, the Dao is lofty, the scenery beautiful, and the human world is lowly, full of mud. There are many deaths and partings, joys and sorrows that they see as inconsequential.

Indeed, many matters unrelated to oneself, knowing the context and probing the details, are not always good. 

For instance, Chen Ping'an didn’t even need to ask Lake Lord Yin Hou why the Yinping Kingdom court didn’t evacuate the citizens of the city, because people may be able to escape, but the karma remains. For the emperor of Yinping Kingdom, even if he fully understands the past and present of the anomalies in Suijia City, he would choose to remain silent. Rather than allow the fleeing commoners to disturb the fortunes of other counties and potentially affect the fate of the entire kingdom, it would be better to resolve the matter cleanly in Suijia City. Hence, the officials and wealthy families of Suijia City remain clueless to this day, still having the indulgent young masters galloping out of the city for leisure.

At dawn, the sounds of charcoal-selling bullock carts could be heard.

Under the moonlight, there should also be the sound of clothes being pounded.

Cultivators avoid the mundane world and the dust of life for good reason.

Chen Ping'an remained crouched in place, contemplating many matters, even after the bonfire had extinguished, still maintaining the posture of warming himself.

Until the break of day.

Chen Ping'an stood up, stowing the burlap sack among his belongings, donning his conical hat, securing the bamboo box on his back, and grasping his travel staff, heading toward Suijia City.

He would not go to the city god temple or the fire god shrine.

He would first take a look at the abandoned haunted house in the city that had been deserted for many years.

After that, he would have to get down to business.

On a night with a darkened sky, a figure in azure robe climbed over the wall into Suijia City.

There was a night curfew in the city, but Chen Ping'an arrived alone at that haunted house. The last time he entered the city, he had inquired about this site at the incense shop.

Chen Ping'an stood outside the dilapidated door in the still of the night.

He gazed at the decayed door, long devoid of its guardian spirit and spring couplets.

That scholar had never avenged his parents even in death.

And what about me, Chen Ping'an from Mud Bottle Alley?!

A young man, no longer wearing straw sandals and no longer needing to go up the mountain to gather medicinal herbs, removed his conical hat.

Several cultivators who had long been lurking, hiding, or taking root near this haunted house felt an unexpected tremor of fear.

Even the dullest and lowest-ranked cultivator was suddenly startled, their minds thrown into chaos without warning.

An old man with a little monkey perched on his shoulder furrowed his brow from a rooftop in the distance. Last time at the city gate, he realized his oversight, completely failing to perceive this young man’s cultivation.

The old man raised a hand, gently pressing down on his agitated pet.

As for those who had already felt suffocated and stagnant in their spiritual energy, no one dared to show themselves to see who this person was.

As the figure on the street removed his conical hat and bamboo box, he vanished into thin air.

The old man began to retreat a few steps.

In the street, outside the door.

The azure robe's sleeves billowed without wind.

The figure disappeared in an instant.

A wisp of azure smoke sliced through the night.

Ultimately landing outside the city god temple.

A burly martial judge clad in iron armor emerged from the temple and said in a deep voice, “Who goes there?!”

But the young swordsman merely raised a hand.

Behind him, the sword immortal slowly unsheathed his sword, gently rotating it, ultimately gripping it lightly in his hand, holding the sword in front of him. With one hand gripping the sword, his fingers lightly brushed along the blade, gradually moving toward the tip.

The originally golden sword body, which glimmered like thick liquid gold, surged with brilliance as the swordsman’s fingers brushed against it.

The martial judge squinted, staring at the dazzling sword light in his hand, murmuring, “Karma or heavenly tribulation, I, Chen Ping'an from Mud Bottle Alley, will accept them all.”

 # Chapter 590: The Second Day of February

The grand doors of the City God Temple slowly creaked open.

In Suijia City, the City God Temple was mostly deserted, save for the City God himself, who was already up to his neck in trouble. The civil and military judges, along with various ghostly officials, had all cautiously gathered inside the temple. Although the entire Suijia City was considered their territory and could rely on certain protections, being within the incense-filled City God Temple still provided a greater sense of security.

Chen Pingan gazed towards the entrance.

After the tragic incident, the City God had chosen to execute one and spare another, which meant that the General of the Shackles was likely a new arrival, while the head of the Yin-Yang division—along with the other officials—remained the same.

Holding his sword, Chen Pingan glanced at the Sword-raising Gourd. “After I strike twice tonight, you can do as you please.”

Lifting his gaze, he addressed the temple’s entrance, “Who is the head of the Yin-Yang division at the City God Temple of Suijia City?”

The civil and military judges, along with the Day and Night spirits and the General of the Shackles, acted without hesitation, quickly directing their attention to a middle-aged scholar-like official among them.

The attire of Yin-Yang officials in the various City God Temples across the world was generally similar to that of the court officials in the mortal realm. The only variations lay in the insignia patterns, as well as some regional differences. For instance, in the Northern Julu Continent, the official robes were predominantly in black and white, with a bronze seal engraved with their respective titles hanging at their waists.

He stepped forward, trembling slightly, his gaze darting nervously. Suppressing the fear within him, he clasped his fists and said, “The Sword Immortal graces our humble City God Temple with a visit. I apologize for the lack of proper reception. May I ask what brings you here?”

It was clear to him and all his colleagues that good people rarely came, and the presence of a sword immortal was nothing to be taken lightly, hence their collective appearance.

In the next moment, the figure of the sword immortal clad in green had already stepped into the temple, leaving the head of the Yin-Yang division standing there, frozen in place. Even though he had already intruded upon the City God Temple, he still took a symbolic step back, as if to create a path, before turning his gaze toward his colleague.

A thin, straight golden thread appeared on the forehead of the Yin-Yang division head, stretching downwards.

In an instant, a golden body shattered into fine dust.

Even the military judge, renowned for subduing vengeful spirits, and the new General of the Shackles, who enjoyed hunting lost souls outside the city, failed to catch a glimpse of how the sword was drawn or when it was drawn.

The faces of all the officials in the City God Temple went pale.

It was truly horrifying.

Indeed, a wandering sword immortal had come to this place!

Word had it that sword immortals acted in the most bizarre and domineering manner and could not be measured by common sense.

The statue of the City God enshrined in the inner sanctum of the temple emitted a faint golden light, and an elegant elderly official stepped out from within. He passed through the temple’s architecture without any obstruction, floating gracefully to the front steps. Once he stood still, he raised a finger, his expression stern, and said, “As a sword cultivator, you believe you can freely slay an imperial official sanctioned by the Emperor?!”

Chen Pingan raised his head, gazing into the dense black fog that enveloped Suijia City, filled with ominous energy, clawing and gnashing.

It was somewhat similar to the half-immortal battle cloud over the Fu family of Old Dragon City, except the latter was invisible to Qi practitioners below the Earth Immortal realm. In Suijia City, however, both cultivators and mortals alike could not see it.

Chen Pingan replied, “I will strive to shield you from the heavenly tribulation. How shall you thank me?”

The City God was first taken aback, then his heart soared with joy. “Really? The Sword Immortal is not jesting?”

The young sword immortal in green nodded.

The City God felt as if there was still a glimmer of hope, that there was light at the end of the tunnel! He raised his voice, saying, “As long as the Sword Immortal can ensure the safety of my City God Temple, you may name any treasures from the entire county, and they shall be yours. If you find it troublesome to ask, just say the word, and all of us at the City God Temple will present them to you without hesitation…”

A golden light cleaved through the air.

The many Yin-Yang officials in the City God Temple felt their hearts shatter, their golden forms trembling. They witnessed the City God, who had enjoyed years of reverence, experiencing the same fate as his Yin-Yang division colleague. First, a beam of golden light appeared on his forehead, followed by a straight line that slowly stretched downward.

Truly, after years of receiving incense offerings, the City God’s sturdy golden body did not shatter immediately. Not only that, but he also managed to raise his hands, pressing them tightly against either side of his head, wailing, “Have you lost your mind? If I die, the heavenly tribulation will descend immediately! Do you think you can withstand it all by yourself? If I do not die, we can still work together to combat the heavenly tribulation and weather this calamity! You madman! May you have a terrible end!”

Chen Pingan’s gaze rose above the City God, fixating on the imposing statue that also enjoyed the offerings of the county yet remained devoid of divine light.

It was unclear whether they were in cahoots or aware of the impending disaster, but it seemed that a portion of the divine essence had been withdrawn from the statue.

Chen Pingan said coolly, “My apologies, I forgot to mention one thing: you must die to thank me.”

The City God pressed his hands against his head, frantically gathering the incense offerings from all directions, regardless of whether they were pure or tainted with malevolent intent. As long as they were from those who came to pay respects, he had already gathered them all within the temple. Whether this was akin to drinking poison to quench thirst was of no concern to him. As long as he could increase his cultivation, the chances of preserving his golden body after the heavenly tribulation would improve. As for whether the City God Temple would be destroyed or whether his subordinate officials would fall short in their cultivation and suffer collateral damage—he had abandoned any concern for that the moment he began to suffer “great karmic losses, leading to a decaying golden body.” 

To this end, he had even sent a group of connected cultivators to the capital to bring heavy gifts, persuading the Ministry of Rites and the Astronomical Bureau, urging the Emperor of Yinpingshan to suppress the news and prevent Suijia City and its citizens from fleeing. Otherwise, it would lead to the worst outcome of both the nation's feng shui and the local City God being harmed.

To die for a county, to preserve a golden body.

One must prioritize oneself, lest heaven punish the earth! 

Moreover, as the City God of a county, he was a golden deity who deemed the mortal kings and nobles as mere fleeting grass!

Pressing his hands against his head, the City God’s gaze fell slightly. While the speed of the golden thread descending slowed, there was no sign of it stopping. Fear surged within him, and he even spoke with a hint of sobbing, “Why is this? Why can’t all this incense hold it back? Sword Immortal, Sword Immortal Sir…”

No longer sporting any arrogance, the City God, now standing on the steps, pleaded, “I implore you, Sword Immortal Sir, spare my life. In this world, is there anything that cannot be discussed?”

The City God did not dare point upwards, “Sword Immortal Sir, look up for a moment. Without me, the City God Temple controlling the incense offerings and utilizing the local energies to resist the heavenly tribulation, you alone truly do not fear exhausting your hard-won cultivation?”

The almost terrified civil judge initially found this incomprehensible, but upon further thought, he realized the truth, which only deepened his despair.

This wandering sword immortal had come to bear the heavenly tribulation out of sheer recklessness, and would he truly care for any gains or losses? If he were truly concerned, why would he enter the City God Temple? 

Hadn’t the City God frequently lectured his subordinates to remain calm in the face of challenges? It seemed that when the moment arrived, all that was left was this.

Yet, the civil judge was no mere bystander, and there was no amusement to be found. For hundreds of years, these divine beings, seated in their respective territories, had looked down upon the foolish mortals who entered the temple to burn incense. They had seen countless absurdities: the dull men and resentful women, the lazy young men seeking wealth, the selfish children unwilling to spend money to treat their sick elders yet burning incense to make wishes, and the ruthless bandits believing that offering money and incense could absolve their sins. They had witnessed enough human folly to become numb. Now, it was time for them to face the consequences, as the Qi practitioners came to witness the farce of their own City God Temple?

Chen Pingan ignored the City God, simply driving his sword into the ground and slowly rolling up his sleeves. Unlike at Cangjun Lake, this time he rolled up his left sleeve as well, revealing the walnut bracelet.

As for the three talismans obtained from Ghost Valley, they were casually slotted between his waist. The opened Yiqing Guangming talisman, along with two remaining Zhan Kan talismans from the Chongxuan Bureau and the Bixiao Mansion talisman, were all prepared.

After completing these, Chen Pingan turned his attention to the City God, whose golden eyes were now darkening.

Recalling the City God’s Temple in the Yanzhi County of the Color Garment Kingdom, indeed, it was similar, though that City God, Shen Wen, had been framed by cultivators from the mountains. The one before him had brought this upon himself—a stark contrast.

In an instant, Chen Pingan stood at the top of the steps, leaning on his sword next to the City God. They stood side by side, yet facing opposite directions.

The green-clad swordsman faced the front hall, where an empty statue sat rigidly, with a golden line extending downward, confronting the temple doors and the living beings.

Desperately trying to maintain his golden body from shattering, the City God had exhausted all efforts, even with the culprit standing beside him, he still had no time to care. 

The golden thread on the City God’s body began to widen, like a flood breaching a dam, a small creek could no longer contain it.

He suddenly laughed, “What a sword immortal! You must have come for that earthly treasure, right?”

Knowing he was doomed, the City God suddenly burst into hearty laughter, then murmured, “What a pity! Even if I, a mere County City God, were to die, I could take a whole host of mountain gods with me; wouldn’t that be delightful?”

Chen Pingan reached out a hand, covering the City God’s face, and with fingers like claws, slowly said, “What face do you have left to look at the mortal world?”

With that, the City God’s golden body shattered with a thunderous crash, resembling a cloud of golden powder scattering in front of the temple.

With a chime, an object fell to the ground with a crisp sound.

It was a piece of rusted golden body fragment, not small, larger than the combined sizes of the two river gods from Cangjun Lake.

Just as Chen Pingan was about to smash it with the tip of his sword, the Sword-raising Gourd at his waist unexpectedly released the long-hidden Initial One, a beam of white light pierced through the rusted golden fragment, and the flying sword Initial One vanished alongside it.

As the golden body of the City God shattered, the skies above Suijia City erupted with thunder, the sound far surpassing regular thunderclaps, akin to firecrackers exploding in one’s ears, waking countless citizens from their deep slumber.

Black clouds churned, resembling a black dragon writhing in the sea of clouds. Moreover, the cloud sea began to slowly descend.

First, the families in the city stirred awake due to the thunder and began lighting their lamps.

The wealthy families hung lanterns one after another.

In the bustling county city, flickering lights connected in patches, punctuated by the sounds of children crying, rising and falling like waves.

Finally, those Qi practitioners who had quietly entered Suijia City were left dumbfounded. After their initial panic, they began to curse loudly. They never expected that the treasured item had not truly revealed itself, yet this damn heavenly tribulation had already arrived ahead of time.

There was much significance in this.

Heavenly materials and earthly treasures born of the world inherently possessed spiritual essence, making it exceedingly difficult for Qi practitioners to capture them. The Lord of Huangyue City had once almost brushed past a marvelous treasure simply because its speed was astonishing.

Rumors circulated in the mountains that the treasure of Suijia City was of extremely high grade, being the essence of a millennium of cultural elegance and prosperity. Moreover, it was said that when Suijia City was first established, there was actually a treasure of military origin buried deep underground, eventually merging with the former to become a rare earthly treasure that combined both literary and martial prowess. Whosoever obtained it would rise swiftly to the pinnacle of cultivation—thus, both Huangyue City and Baodong Immortal Realm dispatched their best to claim it. If Huangyue City succeeded, it would firmly seat them at the top of over a dozen nations, putting significant distance between them and Baodong Immortal Realm. Conversely, if Baodong Immortal Realm succeeded, their power would surpass Huangyue City.

In Suijia City, an elderly man sat atop a nearby roof ridge, slightly irked by a small monkey on his shoulder that wouldn’t calm down, he hurled it away with force.

The local Qi practitioners, especially those of lower realms, began to sense the impending trouble and started fleeing Suijia City in various directions.

That treasure was something they dared not covet. Most were the subordinates of Huangyue City and Baodong Immortal Realm, drawn together to bolster their numbers, and should a real conflict arise, they would offer some assistance.

The elderly man shared the same frustrations; the matter had developed to this point, and it was quite tricky.

That young sword immortal was indeed a reckless one. The four troublesome spirits from the mountains were certainly not unfounded. He roamed the world seeking only his own excitement!

Was a heavenly tribulation wrought from such entanglements something one could simply block? When the situation turned dire, even if he managed to block half of it and fled, would he not still invite unnecessary calamity upon himself?

The elder suddenly remarked, “Damn women, I’m in a foul mood right now, don’t provoke me.”

On the roof ridge stood a woman clad in a skirt, her appearance unremarkable, yet no ordinary woman could stand firm on such a precarious ledge.

The woman covered her mouth, giggling, “Is that how you speak to a queen? Such boldness.”

The elder grumbled, “We’ve ruined the master’s long-planned scheme, and both of us will face countless deaths. Especially in this awkward situation where it’s all come to naught, the master will only become more furious.”

The woman waved her hand, “Though I do not understand why that treasure suddenly fell silent, allowing the heavenly tribulation to exhaust its innate quality without trying to escape, once the tribulation descends, it will still be forced to reveal itself. Huangyue City and Baodong Immortal Realm have already wisely distanced themselves; whether they’ve retreated to the dragon palace of Cangjun Lake or further away to the Black Glaze Mountain to avoid disaster, at that point, we’d have the upper hand, wouldn’t that be better?”

The woman’s expression grew grave as she continued, “We’ve worked together for many years, let me dare to ask a personal question: why doesn’t the master wish to act personally? With the master’s celestial cultivation, after such a great feat, although it would be exhausting and necessitate seclusion, it should have been hundreds of years, he should have recovered his peak cultivation by now. If the master comes, wouldn’t that treasure be easily within reach? Who would dare obstruct him, those useless figures like Fan Weiran?”

The elder scoffed, “You know nothing. Such treasures of merit cannot simply be seized by high cultivation alone. Moreover, the higher the master’s cultivation, the more he is not like those brute warriors and military cultivators. Once he steps into this territory, he becomes the target of everyone. The heavenly tribulation is astute; even if it is endured, the loss of Dao merit would be immense. Can you afford to compensate? Even if you gathered all the worthless treasures in Yinpingshan, it would not cover the loss! Ridiculous!”

The woman paid no heed to the elder’s scorn, instead gazing towards the City God Temple with a frown, “Given the situation, we at least need to temporarily leave Suijia City. If we're close, aren’t we just asking to be the punching bags for the heavenly tribulation? If we’re further away, once it passes, the treasure will surely surface and escape this filthy place. Huangyue City and Baodong Immortal Realm will not be slow to act. We can handle Ye Han and Fan Weiran, but with so many useless minions around them, once their numbers increase, one should beware of ants taking down an elephant.”

The elder chuckled, pointing at the small monkey that had crawled back to his shoulder, constantly baring its teeth towards the City God Temple, “Your vision has become worse after all these years spent mingling with those so-called emperors and officials. Can’t you see? This is the treasure-swallowing monkey purchased by the master for a hefty sum, a descendant of an ancient species, do you have any idea how much celestial money was spent? I fear mentioning it will scare you. With it around, treasures can be swallowed whole, so things aren’t as troublesome as you think. But if you’re useless and get entangled with Ye Han or Fan Weiran, and can’t extricate yourself, I will only leave with the monkey. Whether you enjoy your worldly wealth or continue to carve your fox skin from that nation's dragon spirit, that’s all on you.”

This fox had been a queen multiple times now? 

The elder scoffed inwardly.

The woman sighed, looking up at the slowly descending black clouds, her eyes filled with apprehension, “Will the master’s sworn enemy not meddle? Are there truly only Ye Han and Fan Weiran, the two Golden Core cultivators?”

The elder shook his head, “Since the two sides have clarified their boundaries, avoiding each other and seeking mutual benefit, there shouldn’t be any surprises. At the level of the master, he cares more about promises than we do as mere frogs in the well. Before I left, the master mentioned some definitive words: if you and I cannot even handle two paper tigers of Golden Core, we might as well not return and simply find a place to die.”

The woman nodded, her naturally charming eyes revealing a hint of fervor, “That truly is a fine sword! Definitely a treasure! Even those Earth Immortal sword cultivators would be tempted!”

The elder laughed, “Blind men on the street can see that; do you need to say it? What’s wrong, are you tempted? Then go seize it.”

The woman turned her head, throwing a flirtatious glance, “Old man, you sure talk nonsense. If we want to seize it, that fellow needs to be self-aware and nearly killed by the heavenly tribulation first.”

The elder clicked his tongue, “Haven’t seen you in a while, and you’ve genuinely grown in cultivation. A woman who can attract hearts with her eyes alone, without relying on looks, now that’s skill. Once this is done, shall we have a rendezvous? A brief separation can be sweeter than a new marriage; after all, we haven’t seen each other for hundreds of years?”

The woman lightly tapped her toes, her laughter like tinkling silver bells, as she walked away, leaving a lingering echo, “Old man, if you don’t leave now, it will be too late. Let’s first vacate Suijia City, and after accomplishing the master’s great task, I’ll allow you to pick at your leisure.”

The elder grabbed the small monkey, placing it on his shoulder, and together with the woman, they soared out of the city.

Both naturally suppressed their realms; otherwise, they would attract the attention of Ye Han and Fan Weiran. Though the majority were nothing but brutes, this was a vast territory, comprised of over a dozen nations. Every century, one or two extraordinary talents would emerge, not to be underestimated. Despite their disdainful words about Ye Han and Fan Weiran, should it come to a real confrontation with those cultivators, they would need to exercise caution.

The two flew past the walls of Suijia City.

On the city walls stood many Qi practitioners, undeterred by fear, believing they would be safer once they left Suijia City. They pretended to be calm, pointing and discussing the situation.

Among them was a young cultivator, assigned to the area near the City God Temple, who had been living in obscurity for years. Now that he had finally regained his identity, he cursed particularly vigorously, claiming that the young man who resembled a sword cultivator must have a screw loose or had been kicked by a donkey. Upon entering the City God Temple, he clearly was a stranger, having no grasp of the situation, and without a second thought, he killed an official from the Yin-Yang division. Once he entered the temple, he seemed even more eager to show off his power. Unfortunately, after that, the City God Temple shut its doors, and they could no longer see what transpired inside.

Nearby, another cultivator laughed, saying that the fellow clearly felt he couldn’t get that treasure, so out of spite, he let everyone else miss their chance—truly malicious and deserving of punishment! If that sword cultivator miraculously survived the heavenly tribulation, he would definitely seek him out for a lesson.

The elder, with the monkey on his shoulder, floated over the wall, finding the entire situation amusing. Such foolish individuals were indeed welcome.

Just like those pedants who read books, they needed more of such types to keep the former afloat.

Otherwise, if the world were filled with wise individuals, how would he and that lascivious woman in the imperial palace of Yinpingshan continue to take advantage of the world?
