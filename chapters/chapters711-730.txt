 ### Chapter 711: Who to Spar With, Who to Question About the Sword

Yu Jianfu was actually a very straightforward woman. Losing was just losing; there was no resentment or bitterness in her heart. She got up gracefully, didn't forget to bid farewell to Chen Ping'an, and walked away.

What occupied Yu Jianfu's thoughts now was the third sparring session that Chen Ping'an had politely declined. 

My fists aren’t as strong as others, so what can I do? I can only increase my punch intent and strike faster!

She refused to believe what Cao Ci had said, that after losing to Chen Ping'an, it would be hard to catch up again.

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists in farewell, not uttering a word.

The talisman boat landed on the city wall, and four figures floated down gracefully.

Many sword cultivators dispersed, calling each other and greeting one another. For a moment, all around the high sky north of the city wall was filled with flickering sword lights. However, amidst the excitement, there were also complaints; after all, despite the lively spectacle, an empty wallet was never a pleasant sight. Buying drinks on credit only added to their woes.

Chen Ping'an put on his boots and smoothed down his sleeves. He first bowed in respect to Mr. Zhong, who returned the gesture with a fist salute, smilingly addressing him as “Mountain Master.”

Before leaving the Lotus Root Blessed Land, Zhong Qiu had already resigned from his position as the national teacher to the new emperor of the Southern Garden Kingdom. Now, having arrived at a different realm's Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhong Qiu planned to be a pure martial artist for once, honing his punch intent in a place rich with sword energy. Perhaps one day, he might have a chance to reunite with Yu Zhenyi, no longer a national teacher but a celestial being who had attained the Dao, making it impossible for them to communicate their respective philosophies. Zhong Qiu would then inquire about the celestial methods with his fists.

Chen Ping'an exchanged a knowing glance with Cao Qinglang, who understood without needing prompting to greet his master. Instead, he quietly stood beside Mr. Zhong.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an turned his smile toward Pei Qian and asked, “Did you gain a lot from this journey? Did it delay Mr. Zhong’s studies?”

Pei Qian first nodded eagerly like a chick pecking at rice, then shook her head like a rattle drum, appearing somewhat flustered.

Her master seemed a bit taller again; this was troubling. If he got taller today, and even taller tomorrow, wouldn’t he eventually tower over both Falling-Into-Despair Mountain and Cloud-Embracing Mountain? Would he be taller than this Sword Qi Great Wall?

Chen Ping'an ruffled her hair.

Suddenly, Pei Qian exclaimed, her shoulders swaying as if she were about to topple over. Frowning, she whispered, “Master, isn’t it strange? I don’t know why, but my legs sometimes feel unsteady. It’s not a big deal, so don’t worry. I just trip occasionally, but it doesn’t hinder my training with the old chef. As for copying books, that won’t be affected either; it’s just a leg injury after all.”

Pei Qian stood on her tiptoes, cupping her hands around her mouth, and whispered, “Master, Warm Tree and Rice Grain said I often sleepwalk. I might bump into something one day, like a table leg or a railing.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly understood. “Oh, I see.”

Pei Qian felt relieved. It was indeed a watertight excuse; all was well!

Then Pei Qian’s body stiffened, slowly turning her head.

Qi Jinglong, accompanied by his disciple, approached slowly, looking glum. Why did that troublesome fellow show up so suddenly? He had been praying for blessings and fortune at the Sword Qi Great Wall every day, even invoking the names of various sword immortals to lend him some luck. But it had all been in vain.

Chen Ping'an asked, “When are you going to spar? Why wait for a good day when today is just fine?”

Pei Qian's eyes lit up, and Qi Jinglong looked as if he had been granted a reprieve. The two exchanged glances, their minds in sync. Qi Jinglong cleared his throat and said first, “Spar? That’s nonsense; we’ve had enough of literary sparring!”

Pei Qian echoed, “Yes, Qi Jinglong is Liu’s prized disciple, a cultivator from the mountains. I’m Master’s first disciple, a pure martial artist. I can’t possibly fight Qi Jinglong. Besides, I’ve only been practicing punches for a short time; my skills aren’t refined. Right now, I’m just feeding punches from the old chef, so I dare not spar with others. If I’m going to fight, it will have to wait until I’ve mastered that Crazy Demon Sword Technique.”

Qi Jinglong was quick to retort, “Once you master that sword technique, you’ll still be just a pure martial artist, not a sword cultivator. There’s a world of difference between the two!”

Pei Qian was equally agitated. What did that mean, looking down on my sword skills? You’re looking down on me, Pei Qian! Looking down on me also means looking down on my master?! My master has always considered himself a sword cultivator. Did my left guardian from Dragon Riding Alley lend you his courage?! 

Pei Qian was furious, thumping her walking stick on the ground heavily. “Qi Jinglong, let’s spar today! Right here, right now!”

Chen Ping'an bent two fingers and tapped Pei Qian on the back of her head, saying, “A pure martial artist, punching without pause, must use today’s self to question yesterday’s self. This isn’t about pride. The principle is a bit profound; if you don’t understand, remember it first and ponder it later.”

Pei Qian turned her head, feeling aggrieved. “But Qi Jinglong looks down upon sword cultivators. Master has roamed the world as a sword cultivator for thousands of miles, always considering himself as such. It’s one thing if Qi Jinglong looks down on me; I’m not close to him. But he, as a sword cultivator, looks down on my master—I can’t allow that!”

Qi Jinglong felt like he had just hit a wall harder than Yu Jianfu’s. He wished he could slap himself.

Pei Qian was full of punch intent, surging and swirling like a multitude of once tranquil streams suddenly converging into a roaring waterfall.

Old Master Cui had once fed her punches and casually mentioned a principle: “When the waterfall crashes from halfway up the sky, it falls into the mortal realm like thunder.” This was to say that when punch intent suddenly forms, it generates a martial artist’s aura that fills the world. He also said, “A dragon lifting four claws can support four mountains, towering high and broadening its back and waist.” This described the foundational punch intent like clouds raining down from ancient dragons, nourishing all from the skies. I shall return the water of the seas to the sky, far from the mortal realm.

Chen Ping'an raised an eyebrow.

Pei Qian’s punch intent suddenly dissipated, and she innocently said, “Oh,” lowering her head, wondering what would happen next; her master was angry, so she had to admit her mistake, which was only reasonable.

Old Master Cui had taught punches, but the most insightful student was not Chen Ping'an, but Pei Qian.

At least, that was how Chen Ping'an saw it. Pei Qian learned punches too quickly and grasped the meaning too deeply. As her master, he felt both gratified and worried.

Qi Jinglong was nearly speechless.

If I, the great sword immortal, treated Liu’s disciple the same way Pei Qian treated her master, I reckon Liu would go to the Taihui Sword Sect’s ancestral hall to burn incense, weeping at the portraits of the ancestors, trembling with emotion, saying he finally recruited an exceptionally rare disciple for his sect after a hundred years! 

What’s going on with Chen Ping'an? Did he drink too much at the tavern? Or did that solid punch to his forehead from Yu Jianfu knock his brains loose?

With a solemn expression, Chen Ping'an said, “Qi Jinglong is considered half a family member. You can tease him during friendly banter, but just because he said a few words, you want to take it so seriously and initiate a formal spar? If you go out into the world alone in the future, and happen to hear someone say something about your master or Falling-Into-Despair Mountain, will you then want to teach them a lesson with your fists? That’s not necessarily the case. After all, the future is unpredictable, even your master can’t say for sure. But you tell me, is there the worst possibility? Do you realize that if that one-time event occurs, it could mean a thousand others?”

“If that’s the case, with so many cultivators venturing down the mountain, each mountain would only be higher than the last. The world is a deep place, seeming like a pond but often a deep pool. You’re out there alone, suffering great losses and hardships. A small mistake from someone else could provoke you to unleash a heavy-handed punch due to pride. Then, that person’s family and elders would retaliate. Even if your master would want to defend you afterwards, how much strength can your master muster, and how can he punch without guilt? How can your master encounter that person again, not saying a word, simply throwing punches? How can he punch that person down and only say, ‘My disciple is just small in spirit but righteous in principle. If that’s the case, as a teacher, I’ll use new punches to discuss old principles’?”

Pei Qian lowered her head without speaking.

Qi Jinglong felt as if he had been struck by a thunderbolt.

Cui Dongshan smiled and said, “Mr. Liu, Mr. Zhong, shall we take a casual stroll?”

The group of them shared a tacit understanding, leaving the place behind, leaving only the pair of master and disciple, who had not been apart for too long, but had crossed mountains and rivers between two realms.

Chen Ping'an said, “Your master has already shared his reasoning; it’s now your turn to speak. Your master will only listen to what’s in your heart. As long as it is sincere, regardless of right or wrong, your master will not be angry.”

Pei Qian still remained silent.

She tightly gripped her walking stick.

This was unprecedented.

Chen Ping'an felt somewhat helpless and had to say more, softly, “In the past, your master would not speak these words in front of Cui Dongshan. He would only discuss matters privately with you. But now you are the direct disciple of the Falling-Into-Despair Mountain’s ancestral hall, and your master is often away. Moreover, you have grown quite a bit and learned punches. Instead of protecting your feelings, your master prefers you to remember these principles in front of so many people. If you don’t take them to heart, your master would rather you feel that he has embarrassed you in front of others, and you blame him for being unkind, than for you to neglect these principles. In this world, everything else can be forgiven, but the matter of principle cannot be. If you can speak today, then speak today; if you missed it yesterday, make up for it today. To teach without discipline is the parent’s fault, and to teach without care is the teacher’s laziness. Your master speaks so much about these annoying rules not to bind you when you go out into the world, but to hope you think carefully when things arise. Once you understand, you can punch freely. Once in the world, it’s true, and a hundred times more so. If you feel wronged, return to the mountain and find your master. Your master does not need you to defend him. Since your master is your master, he should protect your path. Pei Qian, do you know what your master wishes for in his heart? That is, whether students taught by Chen Ping'an or any disciple, when they go down the mountain, regardless of where they are in the world, they may not have the strongest punches, their knowledge may not be as great as others, and their skills need not be superb, but the one thing is that no one in the world, regardless of who they are, should teach you how to be a person. Your master is here, Mr. Liu is here; one of them is enough.”

Pei Qian had long since burst into tears, holding her beloved walking stick, which she often confided in, raising her arm to wipe her tears with her left hand and pat her face with her right. But the tears wouldn’t stop, so she gave up, raised her head, wrinkled her face, and choked out, “Master, the reason I said that earlier was that I felt if it were a real fight, as long as Qi Jinglong took it seriously, there’s no way I could beat him. But I’m really angry with him. I can’t win against him anyway, but I must punch! I am the first disciple of my master; he can’t look down on my master and the sword cultivator. Even if I can’t win, I must still hit him!”

“Oh, is that so?” 

Chen Ping'an scratched his head. “Then that means your master was in the wrong. Your master apologizes.”

Chen Ping'an bent down and reached out to help her wipe her tears.

Pei Qian felt a bit embarrassed; how could she be this emotional? She quickly turned her head, then turned back, smiling brightly, “Master, how could you be wrong? Please take back those three words!”

Chen Ping'an pinched her cheek. “You’re just being mischievous.”

He had almost given in to the urge to take out the sword-raising gourd for a drink before, but now he had lost the desire to drink and said, “Knowing the weight of your punches, or being able to think about it before you punch, means you’re always the one punching, not letting your fists lead you. Very good. So if your master is wrong, then he is wrong. Your master is willing to sincerely apologize. And the things your master said, you should also consider. Remember as much as you can, and if you don’t understand something, feel free to ask your master directly. Your master isn’t like some people; he won’t think it’s embarrassing.”

Pei Qian shook her head, swaying leisurely, “That ‘some people’ is ridiculous. You and I are far too different.”

Chen Ping'an gave her another gentle thump.

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, holding her walking stick in one hand and extending the other, swaying beside Chen Ping'an, pretending to be drunk or sleepwalking. She murmured, “Whose master is so powerful, that with a single tap can make someone lose all sense of direction? Where is this? Is it Falling-Into-Despair Mountain? I really envy those who have such a master, envy to the point of drooling! If I’m the first disciple, wouldn’t I be smiling in my dreams?”

Chen Ping'an took out the sword-raising gourd and took a sip of wine, no longer feeling the urge to thump her again.

In a few years, when Pei Qian grows taller and is no longer like a little girl, even her master won’t easily thump her anymore. Just thinking about it made him feel a bit regretful.

So, Chen Ping'an thumped her again, causing Pei Qian to stop her antics. She rubbed her head and walked sideways beside her master, smiling as she asked, “Master, the book says, ‘The immortal caresses my head, granting longevity.’ Do you think one day, I’ll suddenly be enlightened by you? Then I’ll learn punches and practice swords, becoming some kind of celestial being riding on clouds, and then I’ll have to copy books and manage the business in Dragon Riding Alley. I won’t be able to keep up!”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “For cultivators, it seems that talent is what matters most, relying on the grace of heaven and ancestors to eat. However, it truly depends on the heart. If the heart is unsettled and the mind is unfocused, the quest for truth is insincere. No matter how many techniques you learn, you will remain like floating duckweed.”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, “Master, although your current cultivation realm isn’t the highest yet, this saying isn’t something one can simply say without having reached the Ascension realm.”

Chen Ping'an laughed and asked, “You know this? Are you at the Ascension realm?”

Pei Qian replied, “It’s not about how tall you are. Besides, I’m now standing on the highest city wall under the heavens, so what I say now carries more weight.”

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine. “What does all this even mean?”

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an laughed, “If we start from the ground, this may indeed be the highest city wall among the four realms. But if we exclude touching the ground, then the White Emperor City in the Middle Divine Continent of the Haoran Realm might be higher. As for the Baiyu Capital in the Qingming Realm, how high it truly is, there’s no record in books, and I’ve never inquired with anyone. So, when it comes to the Sword Qi Great Wall, who is truly higher remains a mystery. If I get the chance in the future, I’ll have to see for myself.”

Pei Qian curiously asked, “Is it the Baiyu Capital that was modeled after the great Baiyu Capital of Dali? Master, what do you plan to do there? That sounds quite far. I heard from the Great White Goose that it’s not like the Sword Qi Great Wall here; once you board the ferry and climb the Upside Down Mountain, you’ll enter another realm, and we can roam freely. The Great White Goose said he once had the opportunity to go to the Qingming world by his own means, but I don’t believe him. How could a student go before his master? Master, I can’t persuade the Great White Goose; you should tell him to change his bragging ways later. Master, can I know why you’re going to such a distant place?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “It’s not just for sightseeing.”

Pei Qian grew even more puzzled. “Looking for someone?”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Sort of.”

Pei Qian frowned. “Who is it? Why do they have such a big attitude, not even coming to Falling-Into-Despair Mountain to find you?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled.

That person really did have the qualifications to act like a big shot.

One of them claimed, “I must first ask if my fists agree.”

To punch across the world and part the sea of clouds.

Then another said, “I’ll just play with you for fun.”

Twelve flying swords descended upon the mortal realm.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, recalling events from his youth that he would only understand years later, but he quickly remembered where he was now and chuckled softly. “Your master has two wishes that he has never shared with anyone. These two wishes might be impossible to fulfill in this lifetime, but I will always think about them.”

Pei Qian stretched out her hand and rubbed her ears, lowering her voice, “Master, I’m all ears!”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “If that day truly comes, when your master is about to travel far, I will come back and tell you. Making grand proclamations too early is inappropriate.”

Pei Qian sighed, “Then I guess I’ll have to wait two or three years!”

Chen Ping'an murmured, “Even two or three hundred years may not be enough. Perhaps after two or three thousand years, if I truly live that long, it would still be a distant hope.”

Fortunately, even if hope is distant, it still exists.

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands into his sleeves, his steps slow yet steady, smiling with squinted eyes while gazing at the sky.

Chen Ping'an quickly withdrew his gaze. In the distance, Cui Dongshan and the others were looking south at the vast mountains and rivers.

Qi Jinglong stood beside him, casting a sly glance at Chen Ping'an, “Good buddy, I’m counting on you. If you can handle Pei Qian, I’d be fine with calling you ‘Elder Chen’ from now on!”

Chen Ping'an turned to Pei Qian and said, “According to the customs of the world, there really is a world of difference between sword cultivators and sword practitioners. You shouldn’t take too much offense at Qi Jinglong’s words.”

Pei Qian's mood had improved, and she didn’t care what Qi Jinglong had said. Was she that kind of petty person? Was that little notebook she secretly kept thick? Not at all! Now that she was with her master, she changed from being cautious on the ferry to striding confidently, embodying the phrase “walking with swagger, demons trembling.” She raised her head and smiled, “Master, when it comes to learning punches and copying books, I can’t say I’ve achieved much, but I’ve learned at least one-tenth of your capacity. How vast must that capacity be? To hold two plates of dishes and three bowls of rice is nothing! Can’t we bear to have a Qi Jinglong say a few light words? Master, you underestimate me!”

Only one person, Cui Dongshan, remained on the city wall, chuckling.

The only one who could make Pei Qian cry and laugh like this was her own master.

The key was that after Pei Qian cried and laughed, she would truly put her heart into remembering things, thinking about the principles, understanding everything rather than picking and choosing, leaving behind a large part.

Cao Qinglang looked at the now normal Pei Qian and breathed a sigh of relief.

Earlier, whether in words or expression, their master truly played the role of a master.

Qi Jinglong laughed, “Aren’t you going to say something?”

Qi Jinglong tentatively asked, “If I admit my mistake, will that be the end of it?”

Qi Jinglong smiled and said, “It’s hard to say.”

Qi Jinglong hesitated.

Zhang Jinglong spoke softly, “Actually, this matter doesn’t involve absolute right or wrong. What you need to apologize for isn’t those words. In my view, they don’t constitute an offense. Of course, it’s rationally so, but emotionally it may not be. After all, when speaking among people, it clearly indicates that it’s not self-talk. If your mindset is off, having passed through Falling-Into-Despair Mountain without truly putting in your heart, then your interaction with Pei Qian shouldn’t be so awkward.”

“How can I put in my heart? When I encountered her at Falling-Into-Despair Mountain, I knocked her out with a kick.”

It was rare to see Qi Jinglong so mournful on Liu’s side, and he glanced at the little black ball not far away, speaking in a low voice, “How does my brother Chen treat others? You don’t know? Even if you, Liu, don’t know, the whole Sword Qi Great Wall knows. What if Pei Qian got seven or eight parts of Chen Ping'an’s true teachings? You’re so close to Chen Ping'an, and you’ll definitely interact with Pei Qian often. If you go to Falling-Into-Despair Mountain, he comes to Taihui Sword Sect, and if that happens, am I supposed to dodge Pei Qian every time? The key is that my friendship with Chen Ping'an is worthless in Pei Qian’s eyes, and it’ll only bring more trouble. In the end, it’s still Chen Ping'an’s fault; he cursed me, saying my mouth easily attracts the flying swords of sword immortals. Now, it’s fine. The flying swords didn’t come, but Pei Qian has set her sights on me. Look, look, Pei Qian is glaring at me. That smile on her face is just like my brother Chen’s! I’ve figured it out; even though Chen Ping'an just taught Pei Qian a lesson, he actually cares for her the most. Now, I’m worried that the next time I go to the tavern for drinks, Chen Ping'an will pour some kind of drug into my drink. Half a jar of wine and half a jar of poison—that sounds like something he would do. It can trap me and save him money, killing two birds with one stone.”

Qi Jinglong laughed, “Looks like you’ve been thinking quite a bit.”

Qi Jinglong felt a deep sense of lament. With a master like you who only takes pleasure in others’ misfortunes and doesn’t help, what good is that?

Pei Qian bounced up to everyone, saying to Qi Jinglong, “From now on, we’ll only spar in literature.”

What is face? Just a joke; can it be eaten?

Before meeting her master, she had wandered the Jianghu in the capital of Southern Garden Kingdom for countless years. At that time, without learning punches, she had no face within the Jianghu.

Upon hearing this, Qi Jinglong was almost so excited he could cry like Pei Qian.

But Pei Qian merely turned slightly, facing away from her master, pursed her lips, smiled, and remained still.

Qi Jinglong felt as if he had been struck by lightning.

Chen Ping'an placed a hand on Pei Qian’s head, and she immediately cheered, “You, Qi Jinglong, are determined to become a great sword immortal! Liu’s master has taken in such a good disciple; that’s truly a master-sword immortal pairing. Next time I accompany my master to visit your Taihui Sword Sect, I’ll bring a few bundles of firecrackers to celebrate!”

Chen Ping'an said, “Speak properly.”

Pei Qian cleared her throat. “Qi Jinglong, I was wrong earlier. Don’t take it to heart. I apologize.”

Earlier, when her master told her he was sorry, how heavy must those words have been? There’s no way to measure that weight in this world!

She split off a tiny bit and offered it to Qi Jinglong as a light rain.

Qi Jinglong felt his scalp tingle and his expression stiffen. “I don’t mind.”

Of course, I dare not mind.

Pei Qian smiled, “I’ve learned punches late and slowly, so it’ll take me some time to reach even the slightest level of five realms. So I’ll ask Qi Jinglong... Brother Qi, for advice in a few years.”

Qi Jinglong held his head high, “Didn’t we agree to spar only in literature?”

Pei Qian chuckled, “Those matters can wait until later.”

Cao Qinglang watched this scene and was actually quite happy.

It turns out that he wasn’t the only one afraid of Pei Qian.

Chen Ping'an sent a ripple of thought to Qi Jinglong, “Is Qi Jinglong so restrained around Pei Qian that it might affect his cultivation?”

Qi Jinglong smiled and replied, “Consider it an essential way to cultivate the heart. Earlier, on the Flying Peak, Qi Jinglong didn’t have much motivation to cultivate, but now that he has changed quite a bit, he truly wants to learn the sword. However, he has been stubbornly holding onto his original disposition, perhaps intentionally at odds with me. Now that you, the first disciple, are supervising him, I don’t see it as a bad thing. Earlier, when it was just a rumor that Pei Qian would come, he was particularly diligent about practicing the sword.”

Chen Ping'an said, “If Qi Jinglong refuses to put out his all, even if it means losing face and feeling humiliated, he still hasn’t considered using his trump card from the Deer-Cutting Mountain. That in itself is an error. Otherwise, both sides had opportunities to spar at Falling-Into-Despair Mountain.”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “My disciple is worse than yours?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “That’s still true.”

Qi Jinglong inquired, “Then what about the master?”

Chen Ping'an said, “How old am I this year? What can I compare with a sword cultivator who is almost a hundred years old? If we really compare, you’re now in the Jade Purity realm, right? I’m currently a fifth-realm Qi Master. Based on our ages, you can consider me a fifteenth-realm cultivator, four realms higher than your current eleventh-realm Qi Master. Not convinced? Then let’s leave that for another time. When I’m a hundred years old, we’ll see if I’ve reached the fifteenth realm. If not, then consider my words nonsense. Until then, don’t keep bringing up realms.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “The second shopkeeper not only has plenty of wine but also plenty of wisdom!”

Chen Ping'an felt a bit guilty. “You flatter me.”

Chen Ping'an stopped chatting idly with Qi Jinglong; if this fellow really got serious about reasoning with him, he would have a headache.

Chen Ping'an looked at Cui Dongshan and asked, “Should we visit my senior brother first, or go to Ningfu?”

Cui Dongshan seemed to have already planned it out, smiling, “You can go to Ningfu first; I can pay respects to your senior brother alone.”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and agreed.

Cui Dongshan suddenly said, “Elder Sister, lend me a yellow talisman for courage.”

Pei Qian was rather puzzled at this moment; where did her master get a senior brother from?

Regarding this matter, Chen Ping'an had no time to explain, as it wasn’t appropriate to discuss it in the letter. Cui Dongshan didn’t bother to explain further; he couldn’t even remember whether that person’s surname was Left or Right. If not for Chen Ping'an mentioning it earlier, he wouldn’t have known such a significant sword immortal was now staying at the city wall, flaunting his sword energy.

Pei Qian took out a yellow talisman from her sleeve and handed it to Cui Dongshan, reminding him, “Isn’t Master’s senior brother also my grand-master? But I haven’t prepared a gift for my grand-master.”

Cui Dongshan maintained a stern expression. “That grand-master who fell from the sky is quite fierce; five big words are engraved on his forehead: ‘Everyone owes me money.’”

Pei Qian turned to look at Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Don’t listen to his nonsense. Your grand-master has a cold exterior but a warm heart. He is the highest in swordsmanship within the Haoran realm. Later, you can show him your Crazy Demon Sword Technique.”

Pei Qian was frightened, “Master, you’ve forgotten? My legs were unstable earlier, and now they’re starting to ache again. I might bump into something while sleepwalking and can’t perform that trivial sword technique, so don’t let my grand-master laugh at me, okay?”

Qi Jinglong felt inexplicably struck by lightning again.

Sleepwalking and bumping into things...

Qi Jinglong held back his laughter, leading Qi Jinglong to another part of the city wall where he would practice swordsmanship with the disciples of the Taihui Sword Sect.

As they left, it was the first time Qi Jinglong felt that practicing swordsmanship was such a delightful experience.

Chen Ping'an summoned the talisman boat and took Pei Qian and the others away from the city wall toward the northern city.

Since his teacher wasn’t present, Cui Dongshan felt no inhibitions, strutting about the city wall like a crab, waving his sleeves, leaping up and floating down, continuously rising and falling, searching for that old friend, who was now his senior uncle, to reminisce about old times. 

Recollecting the past, he couldn’t help but think about how long it had been since he had last seen his brother. If it weren’t for his senior brother still having a bit of money in his pocket, who knows how many years the old scholar would have had to go without?

The old scholar had once established a respectable academy, but it wasn’t his doing. After all, Baoping Continent was too far from Middle Divine Continent. The family wouldn’t have sent much money at first. Ultimately, it was because the old scholar took in a third disciple that he finally stood tall and proud, able to drink freely and buy books and paper without worry.

“Little Qi, why have you suddenly taken up chess? That’s great! Go find your senior brother; his chess skills are decent enough. But you know, in the academy, there’s no chessboard or pieces. The chess pieces and boards from the Liuli Studio are from the Jiangzhou’s Ma Ti Fang. Although it’s quite close to the academy, don’t buy them; they’re too expensive. Just don’t buy them; it’s better to walk a few hundred extra steps than to waste a single coin.”

“Okay, master.”

“Little Qi, I’ve been practicing calligraphy and observing the inscriptions recently. If the divine helps me, my seal script skills will greatly improve. Do you want to learn?”

“I understand, master. I want to learn.”

“Little Qi, have you read the second You’s reprinted ‘Miaohua Collection’? Binding and paper quality are minor issues; the important thing is that the former sages’ works are significant. If there are missing or erroneous characters, that’s not acceptable. A single character can sometimes mean a vast difference, making the teachings of the sages seem worlds apart. We, as scholars, mustn’t overlook this.”

“Master is right; I understand.”

Of course, this fellow was also the most skilled at causing trouble and was always spot on.

“Master, Senior Left is unreasonable again; can you help me see who’s right and wrong...”

“What? That rascal hit you again? Little Qi, first wipe your nose, don’t rush to reason with your master. Let’s go, I’ll take you to settle the score with Senior Left.”

“Master, Senior Left just analyzed a book’s meaning with me, and when he couldn’t win the argument, he...”

“What? You’ve got a bump on your forehead?! Rebellion! Let’s go, Little Qi, help your master get the feather duster and the ruler! Oh right, Little Qi, don’t bother with the stool; it’s too heavy.”

“Master...”

“Let’s go! We’re going to confront Senior Left!”

“Master, this time it was Junior Cui who played dirty in chess. I don’t want to learn chess from him anymore; I think a person who regrets a move isn’t a real chess player.”

“Ah?”

“Master’s regrets in chess are to teach students more, so naturally, they don’t count.”

“Let’s go! This time we’ll take the stool too! But don’t really hit him; just scare him. It’s enough to have some momentum.”

Scholars, especially those who have cultivated the Dao, live long lives.

There are many old stories.

Cui Dongshan was not that old rascal Cui Chen.

Cui Dongshan often thought about those miscellaneous stories, especially those of old friends.

Especially every time that person would complain about his fellow disciples or when he himself was scolded by the master, the old senior brother often watched the fun from the door or window.

So these were things he had seen and heard firsthand.

Cui Dongshan knew better than anyone else that all those seemingly trivial past events, as long as they were remembered, cannot be considered truly past, but rather matters of today, matters of the future, circling in this life.

Unknowingly, Cui Dongshan arrived near the Left and Right.

Left was still sitting with his eyes closed on the city wall, nourishing his sword intent.

As for Cui Dongshan’s arrival, he didn’t even glance over, completely ignoring him.

Cui Dongshan jumped down from the city wall and walked to about twenty steps away from the city wall and that figure.

The white-clad youth jumped up, his legs kicking wildly. Then he unleashed a flurry of punches aimed at Left’s back.

Shifting places, he continued, all filled with those renowned martial arts styles from the Jianghu.

Occasionally, as he soared through the air, he would bend down and stretch out to touch his toes, presumably with a stunningly graceful posture.

Finally, after a hundred moves, with his small Jade Purity realm cultivation, he was able to match Left, achieving a draw. This could be considered a decent start at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Left didn’t even bother to turn his head, asking indifferently, “Do you want to be killed by my sword or chopped to pieces by a few more?”

“Elder Sister, someone threatened me; it’s terrifying!”

Cui Dongshan slapped his forehead and stuck the talisman to his forehead with a loud smack, saying, “I forgot Elder Sister isn’t here.”

Left reached out,凝聚出 a long sword of condensed sword intent.

He didn’t even want to draw his sword.

This person behind him didn’t even deserve it.

You, Cui Chen, can stand proud in Baoping Continent and be worthy of the Haoran Realm.

But you have no right to claim you are unworthy of your master!

I, Left, am a student of the master; I was once the junior brother of Cui Chen!

But from that day onward, I, Left, became the senior brother.

Cui Dongshan shouted, “Have some respect for your own junior brother!”

Left stood up, sword in hand.

Compared to the gatekeeper at the Upside Down Mountain, who stood tall like a mountain, Left’s demeanor was light as a cloud.

The sword intent was abundant and heavy, yet his sword intent was not lacking, nearly in sync with the laws of heaven and earth.

The world was separated.

Cui Dongshan tilted his neck, “Just kill me; I won’t even mention the serious matters anymore. After all, you’ve never cared about your junior brother’s life or the path. Come on, aim for me, and make sure to chop my head off at least seven or eight miles away!”

Left turned around. “Just a half-death chop will still allow for conversation.”

Cui Dongshan changed his posture, hands behind his back, looking up at the sky, a look of sorrow on his face, “Oh, alas, woe is me, long sigh!”

Left turned his head.

Cui Dongshan hurriedly said, “I’m not that old rascal Cui Chen; I’m Dongshan!”

On this day, a youth who resembled a drifting white cloud was struck down from the northern city wall by a three-foot-long sword formed from pure sword intent, landing seven or eight miles away on the ground.

Left resumed his seated position, sneering, “This is considering my little junior brother.”

Left furrowed his brows.

That great sword immortal approached him, smiling, “Did you notice the previous anomalies?”

Left nodded.

If it weren’t for this, Cui Chen, or rather, now Cui Dongshan, probably wouldn’t dare to come see him alone.

Chen Qingdu sighed, “That was your junior brother’s heartfelt voice; your swordsmanship isn’t high enough to hear it.”

Left’s expression remained neutral. “You speak so well; please say a bit more.”

Chen Qingdu shook his head. “I won’t say more. If I were to say that, it would involve matters concerning the three realms.”

Previously, when Chen Ping'an was walking on the city wall with his disciples, he had heartfelt thoughts that he hadn’t voiced, merely stirring in his chest.

It turned out that relying solely on heartfelt thoughts could evoke some interesting movements.

Chen Qingdu merely sighed, “Youth is truly wonderful.”

That not-so-young youth had just engaged in a bit of self-dialogue.

“Everyone, please don’t rush.”

“Allow me to reach the tenth realm of martial artists first, then strive for the eleventh realm.”

“Then I’ll question the heavens with my fists.”

“Allow me to reach the Ascension realm.”

“Question the sword in the Baiyu Capital!”

And at this moment, that young man was standing awkwardly at the entrance of Ningfu.

He had two surprises.

One was that Ning Yao had unexpectedly broken her seclusion and stood at the door to welcome their group.

The other was that his own first disciple, upon seeing Ning Yao, without a second thought, knocked his head three times heavily.

Chen Ping'an said helplessly, “Pei Qian, isn’t that a bit much?”

Pei Qian didn’t stand up; she only raised her head and shouted, “Pei Qian pays respects to the esteemed master-in-law!”

Chen Ping'an immediately maintained a stern face, not too much and not too little; the etiquette was just right.

The most awkward one wasn’t Chen Ping'an, but Cao Qinglang.

At this moment, Cao Qinglang’s bow seemed insufficient, and kneeling to knock his head would be entirely inappropriate.

Ning Yao tugged at Pei Qian’s ear, pulling her to her feet. However, once Pei Qian straightened, there was still some amusement in Ning Yao’s eyes. She gently wiped away the dust from Pei Qian’s forehead and took a careful look at the little girl, smiling, “In the future, even if you’re not too pretty, at the very least, you’ll be a girl who’s easy on the eyes.”

Pei Qian’s tears flowed like a river as she sniffled, sincerely saying, “How can your vision be so good, esteemed master-in-law? First, you chose master, and now you say this. If you keep this up, I’m going to worry that master isn’t good enough for you!”

Ning Yao cast a sidelong glance at a certain someone.

Chen Ping'an quickly nodded, “This worry is quite reasonable.”

Ning Yao shifted her gaze back to the scholarly youth, smiling, “You must be Cao Qinglang. You look more like a scholar than your teacher.”

Only then did Cao Qinglang bow respectfully, “I pay my respects to the esteemed master-in-law.”

Ning Yao nodded, then clasped her fists toward Zhong Qiu, saying, “Ning Yao has met Mr. Zhong.”

Zhong Qiu clasped his fists in return, smiling, “Zhong Qiu from Falling-Into-Despair Mountain, I apologize for any disturbances.”

Pei Qian suddenly remembered something, took off her包裹, carefully pulled out a small brush and a piece of colorful cloud letter paper, and tiptoed to give them to her master-in-law.

She then tiptoed a bit more and whispered to Ning Yao, “Esteemed master-in-law, I chose this colorful cloud letter paper. You wouldn’t know, I walked so far on the Upside Down Mountain, and going further, I was afraid I’d fall into the sea. The brush was chosen by Cao Qinglang. Esteemed master-in-law, I swear on my conscience, it’s not that we didn’t want to spend more money; it’s just that we didn’t bring much with us. But mine is more expensive, three snowflake coins, while his is cheaper, only one coin.”

Cao Qinglang scratched his head.

Chen Ping'an exchanged smiles with Zhong Qiu.

Ning Yao glanced at the small brush, recognizing it was something the little girl had originally intended for her master. She rubbed Pei Qian’s head and smiled at the reserved youth, saying, “Cao Qinglang, you owe a greeting gift; remember to make it up later.”

Cao Qinglang scratched his head and nodded.

Pei Qian was left stunned.

Oh wow! 

How could the master-in-law’s eye for talent be hundreds of times better than mine! 

No wonder the master-in-law could pick out her master from among so many in the four realms!

The master-in-law’s home is indeed a huge mansion.

Pei Qian followed closely behind Ning Yao, chatting away.

Chen Ping'an walked alongside Cao Qinglang, while Zhong Qiu intentionally or unintentionally walked behind them.

Chen Ping'an chuckled softly, “In the coming free time, you can help your master with a small task; let’s carve a seal together.”

Cao Qinglang nodded in agreement.

Chen Ping'an twisted his wrist and secretly slipped a small carving knife to Cao Qinglang while Pei Qian was temporarily distracted by her master-in-law. It didn’t matter if she forgot about her master; he quietly reminded, “This is for you; just make sure Pei Qian doesn’t see it, or you’ll bear the consequences.”

Cao Qinglang smiled, “Got it, Master.”

 ### Chapter 712: The Solitary Hearts of the World

Although the Ning residence was not located on Tai Xiang Street or Xuan Hu Street, the estate itself was quite expansive.

Chen Ping An assisted the three of them in selecting three houses. Since Cao Qinglang was a Qi practitioner, the location was of utmost importance to him; the spiritual energy (Qi) could not be thin, yet the sword energy could not be too heavy. After all, as a cultivator on the cusp of breaking through to the Observation Sea realm, he was exactly the type of person who would least want to be in a foreign land filled with dense sword energy. Fortunately, Chen Ping An was well-acquainted with the Ning residence, so he knew precisely where Cao Qinglang and the others should reside, along with the nuanced considerations and major concerns involved. Ning Yao had entrusted these decisions to Chen Ping An, leaving him free from the need to consult with her as the owner of the Ning estate, or to inquire as someone who was still considered a half outsider.

Pei Qian flitted about like a small yellow bird, resolutely circling around her master, Ning Yao.

At first, Chen Ping An worried that Pei Qian might disrupt Ning Yao's seclusion, but Ning Yao simply replied, "When is the path of cultivation not a time of seclusion?" With that, Chen Ping An had nothing more to say. Ning Yao then took Pei Qian to see the Ning residence's treasury, where they stored celestial treasures and mountain artifacts, claiming that she wanted to give Pei Qian a welcome gift and allowed her to choose freely. Afterward, Ning Yao would select another item as a return gift for the present they received earlier at the main gate.

Zhong Qiu and Chen Ping An discussed some of the Ning residence's rules and taboos, then he headed alone toward the pavilion at Dragon Slaying Cliff.

Cao Qinglang had placed his belongings in his new house and followed Chen Ping An to the small residence. As they walked, Chen Ping An, hands tucked into his sleeves, laughed, "Originally, I wanted to have both you and Pei Qian stay at my place. Do you remember back when the three of us first met? But now, you're at a crucial juncture in your cultivation, so you must prioritize your practice."

Cao Qinglang nodded with a smile, "Sir, to be honest, I've been afraid of Pei Qian since that time. I just didn't want you to look down on me, so I tried my best to act unafraid. But deep down, I truly admire her. I always felt that if I were in her shoes, I wouldn't survive in the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom. Back then, there were many things about Pei Qian that I couldn't understand, and I honestly didn't like her much. But how could I dare to criticize her? You might not know this, but when you left, Pei Qian told me many tales of her adventures in the martial world. It was clear what she was implying."

Chen Ping An laughed and asked, "While I wasn't in your ancestral home, did Pei Qian ever sneak up on you?"

Cao Qinglang nodded vigorously, though he didn't go into detail.

Chen Ping An didn't press further.

He could easily imagine the interactions between Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian during his absence from the alley.

Of course, when the three of them were together, Chen Ping An would do things that both Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian would never have thought deeply about back then; it could be in words or in small matters.

However, many things were truly for Cao Qinglang alone to confront, ranging from the life and death of elders to small bits of gossip that pierced one's back, hidden in the casual conversations over sunflower seeds, or disguised in the heaps of dishes shared among neighbors.

In truth, the child, Cao Qinglang, had endured everything simply by persevering through hardships, eventually seeing the clouds part and the moon shine through, day following night.

Back then, Cao Qinglang truly couldn't hold his own against Pei Qian; he didn't even dare fight back. The key was that Pei Qian, besides her carefree demeanor, exuded an aura that felt almost like that of a bandit. With one stomp, she could crush an anthill; with one slap, she could swat a fly. How could Cao Qinglang not be afraid? Especially that one time when Pei Qian held a small stool, staring intently at him but refraining from saying a word. The frail child that Cao Qinglang was then, he was genuinely terrified. As a result, on many occasions when Chen Ping An wasn't at the house, Cao Qinglang could only be chased out to the doorstep, serving as a doorman.

A lonely child sat quietly on the steps, too afraid to stay indoors; he could only gaze longingly at the corner of the street, waiting for the arrival of the young master Chen, who wore white and carried a sword, with a vermilion wine gourd at his waist. As long as he saw that figure in the alley, Cao Qinglang could finally return home, yet he couldn't say a word, let alone complain.

Because Pei Qian was indeed very clever, a kind of cleverness that Cao Qinglang, at that age, couldn't imagine. She had once warned him, "You're just a boy without parents, but you still have some worth. If you dare to complain, I'll hit you once for every time you do. Even if that rich bastard throws me out, I'll scale the wall at midnight to smash your pots and pans. Can you stop me? That guy pretends to be nice and helps you, but can he keep that up for a day or two? What kind of person is he, and what kind of person are you? Do you really think he will always be here? Besides, I know his temper better than you, you fool. No matter what I do, he won't dare to hit me. So, if you don't know your place, I can hold a grudge against you for years. Every festival, your family will be down on its luck; you won't even afford couplets for the doorman. I might just steal your water bucket to carry other people's waste, and smear it all over your door. Every time I pass by your house, I'll be sure to pocket a bunch of stones. I want to see whether it takes you longer to fix your windows or me to gather stones."

What made it most unbearable for Cao Qinglang back then wasn't just those overt threats, or the harsh words Pei Qian thought were the most frightening. It was those other words she said lightly and playfully, with a smile.

"Your family's so poor that the rice jar is cleaner than your bed! The only use you have as a door god is to roll out and guard the door. Do you know how many copper coins it takes to have two door gods? You could sell yourself and still not afford it. Look at other families; more and more people are living well, earning more money. And your family? Someone dies, and hardly any money is left behind? Your father used to sell things door-to-door, right? Isn’t there a lot of pottery down by the top scholar's lane? Didn’t your father spend all his money on those women’s little hands?"

"Sunflower seeds? Gone?! Do you believe I’ll smash your jar of them? Tear up your precious books? When that Chen guy returns to this miserable place, you’ll have to kneel and cry. He’s got money—what's it to him to buy you some sunflower seeds? Staying at an inn costs money as well. You're foolish, and he's bad; neither of you is any good. No wonder you two have become a pair. I must have been cursed for eight lifetimes to end up with both of you."

"Cao Qinglang, you wouldn't really think that guy likes you, would you? He just pities you. He and I are cut from the same cloth. Do you know what kind of people we are? It's like when I see a baby bird that fell from a tree; I genuinely feel sorry for it. Then I find a stone, and with one throw, I put it out of its misery. Is there any reason in that? So, am I a good person? You think I’m sticking around your house for no reason? I’m protecting you. Who knows, one day he might just kill you. With me here, he wouldn’t dare—aren’t you grateful?"

"Why do you look so gloomy every day? Aren't you the only one left with your parents? What’s wrong, did another pair die? Sigh, forget it. After all, you owe your early-dead parents and the name they gave you. If I were your parents, during the seventh day after death or on Qingming Festival, if I saw you again, I’d surely die of anger a second time. Cao Qinglang, I think you might as well just die. If you die early and run fast enough, maybe you can catch up with your parents. But remember to die far away. Don’t let that guy find you. He’s rich, but stingy. He wouldn’t even buy you a tattered mat. Anyway, this house will belong to me from now on."

Cao Qinglang had taken the initiative to fight Pei Qian twice: once for his parents and once for that Chen guy, who hadn’t returned for a long time. Of course, there was no way Cao Qinglang could be Pei Qian's match. She was used to fighting with others and getting beaten; dealing with someone who didn’t even dare to strike back was a piece of cake for her. But even though she found it unchallenging, she was still quite forceful, so the two times he fought didn’t end well for Cao Qinglang.

Chen Ping An led the now-not-so-weak Cao Qinglang into the side room with two tables. Chen Ping An had him sit at the table where the seals and fan frames were kept while he began organizing the surveying maps and documents.

The act of "recording accounts" was something that student Cao Qinglang and disciple Pei Qian were still learning, with the latter picking it up a little more.

Chen Ping An had never shared this with anyone.

In his heart, he viewed Cao Qinglang as someone whose life experiences were somewhat like his own, and their natures were indeed quite similar, but in truth, they were not entirely the same.

It was a strange feeling.

Yet this did not prevent Chen Ping An from wishing to leave the Lotus Blossom Paradise with Cao Qinglang when the time came. Even if he couldn't achieve it, he still thought of that alley boy fondly, sincerely hoping that Cao Qinglang could one day become a seed of learning, wearing a scholar's robe, and become a true scholar like Mr. Qi. He would later regret leaving so hastily, worried he might teach incorrectly. Many things that were right for Chen Ping An could turn out to be wrong for this child. Thus, before the Lotus Blossom Paradise was divided into four, with Chen Ping An claiming one, he had always kept Cao Qinglang in his thoughts. Even when he was in a tavern on the border of the Daquan Dynasty in Tongye Prefecture, when Pei Qian asked him that question, he didn't hesitate to say that he had no intention of bringing Pei Qian along. If he could, he would only take Cao Qinglang away from their hometown and back to his own.

As the saying goes, even the clay Buddha has its temper.

But in Chen Ping An's case, it was rare to see, especially when he was genuinely angry with Pei Qian, a scenario that had only happened once in his life.

Zhao Shuxia practiced boxing in a way that resembled himself the most. Yet, in Zhao Shuxia, Chen Ping An saw his best friend, Liu Xianyang. From the first meeting, how Zhao Shuxia protected Luan Luan was similar to how Liu Xianyang had become familiar, then friends, and eventually his best friend over many years, protecting Chen Ping An.

What truly resembled Chen Ping An, in fact, was Pei Qian's timid gaze when secretly observing the world, and Sui Jingcheng's calculating heart. Now, there was also a boy from the Sword Energy Great Wall, who resembled not Zhang Jiazhen, who was already helping at the tavern, but a poverty-stricken boy named Jiang Qu from the Straw Hat Alley. In those streets, every time Chen Ping An played the storyteller, Jiang Qu spoke the least, often squatting at a distance, yet he was the one with the most thoughts and the most dedicated to learning boxing. Thus, he learned the most. A few well-timed encounters and words revealed how slightly awkward Jiang Qu appeared, but his gaze was determined. Chen Ping An had uniquely taught him the Sword Furnace Stance of the Shaking Mountain Fist.

Every time Jiang Qu squatted there, seeming to listen intently to the storyteller's tales of mountains and rivers, his expression, complexion, and the subtle words exchanged with familiar people were filled with an ambiguous sense of calculative intent.

Chen Ping An felt no disgust, only a hint of sadness.

No one knew why Wei Ban spoke of A Liang's matters in front of the bamboo building at Luopo Mountain.

Why did young Chen Ping An shed tears, and why, beyond longing, did he bury a deep, indescribable shame, regret, and helplessness? That was an emotion Wei Ban had not grasped at the time.

Almost everyone believed that was Chen Ping An's first journey far from home, accompanying Li Baoping and the others to the Great Sui Academy. It was a time when Chen Ping An tried his best to safeguard them on their path. In retrospect, it seemed Chen Ping An couldn’t have done better; no one could fault him.

However, after the straw sandal boy first encountered A Liang, that was when another significant test quietly began in Chen Ping An's life, a tug-of-war within his heart.

He hoped that in the eyes of that man, who called himself a swordsman, he would be the one entrusted with hope by Mr. Qi. Chen Ping An hoped for an unexpected appearance that would ensure he made no mistakes. Consequently, that journey that began by the riverbank and ended at the Red Candle Town post station saw Chen Ping An constantly trying to guess A Liang's thoughts, imagining what preferences a transcendent being might have, and what they might dislike. He speculated about this friend of Mr. Qi, who wore a knife but called himself a swordsman, and what kind of junior he would appreciate. Even if he didn't like or respect him, he absolutely couldn't let the other party feel disgusted. Thus, everything Chen Ping An said and did during that time was deliberate and careful. Did that young boy truly have the heart to admire mountains and waters while traversing that landscape?

Even though Chen Ping An's original intention was to ensure that he safely escorted Baoping and the others to the academy, and that the quirky man with the donkey and bamboo knife would not harm them in the slightest, looking back on that stage of his life afterward, the more he thought, the more sorrowful he felt, leading him to often want to drink.

Once the path of life is walked, it has truly been traversed; one cannot return to the hometown. 

Occasionally glancing back, how could he not drink?

Today's cautious Jiang Qu at the Sword Energy Great Wall bore a striking resemblance to the once troubled Chen Ping An among the mountains and rivers.

Cao Qinglang moved gently, examining some engraved seals and fan inscriptions. Suddenly, he noticed that his master was sitting quietly at the neighboring table, lost in thought.

Cao Qinglang didn’t dare disturb his master’s contemplation, so he took out the small, ancient-looking carving knife, which still bore a sharp edge, and placed it gently on the table.

He didn't know why his master had chosen to gift him this item. Certainly, Cao Qinglang was not one to underestimate the value of the carving knife, thinking it was made of ordinary materials. Quite the contrary, the spontaneous gift from his master, the more "worthless" it seemed, the more he treasured and respected it.

Chen Ping An stood up and smiled, "I was just thinking about some past events."

Cao Qinglang had already risen.

Chen Ping An gestured for him to sit, "No need for such formalities in the future. Just be at ease."

Cao Qinglang nodded with a smile but waited until Chen Ping An sat down before taking his seat.

Chen Ping An, hands tucked into his sleeves, leaned forward to glimpse the small carving knife on the table and smiled, "This carving knife was a gift from the shopkeeper when I bought that jade seal in the capital of the Great Sui during my first journey away from home. Do you remember those bamboo slips I gave you? Every character was carved with this small knife. The object itself isn’t valuable, but it holds significant meaning in my life."

Cao Qinglang stood up, took a few steps back, and performed a respectful bow.

Chen Ping An helplessly said, "Some meanings are just that—merely meanings. You don’t need to treat it so seriously. I have many items that hold meaning for me, most of which aren't worth much. If you're so concerned, I have a whole pile of straw sandals. Would you like a pair? If you bow to me, who loses and who gains? It seems like everyone just ends up at a loss; neither the student nor the teacher profits, so let’s avoid such dealings."

Cao Qinglang shook his head and laughed, "Master, let’s skip the straw sandals. I can weave them myself, and I might even do a better job than my master."

Chen Ping An shook his head, "When it comes to scholarship and cultivation, as a half-baked teacher, I might not even compare to you. Only in weaving straw sandals have I traveled the world and seldom met a match."

Cao Qinglang smiled slightly.

Chen Ping An joked, "According to the new garden owner Li Tuanjing's analogy at the Wind and Thunder Garden, if weaving straw sandals is also a form of cultivating the Dao, then you’d just be a novice at the lower fifth realm, unaware of what the upper fifth realm of straw sandal weaving looks like."

Cao Qinglang nodded, "If you say so, Master."

Chen Ping An was at a loss for words. He thought about how his own Luopo Mountain was lacking in atmosphere; there were no opportunists, no flattery from those in the Ascension realm, all of whom had been led away by his senior disciple and Zhu Lian. So, Cao Qinglang’s integrity was exactly what he needed.

Thus, Chen Ping An smiled in satisfaction. He had finally taken in a more normal and good student.

Cao Qinglang felt somewhat awkward, reaching for a bamboo fan with inscriptions and carved ribs. The folding fan had a rather elegant nickname, with "cool breeze" being one of them.

The inscriptions on the fan were prominent and easily discernible, but what Cao Qinglang truly liked was a line of tiny characters on one of the large ribs, almost like a shy child who didn’t dare to be seen, the writing so small that an inattentive buyer might mistake it for a fan without any inscriptions at all, and it could be forgotten for months or years, in this life and the next.

Cao Qinglang closed the fan, holding it in his palm, gazing at that line of characters. He looked up and smiled, "It’s no wonder you enjoy drinking, Master."

Chen Ping An chuckled knowingly.

The bamboo bore inscriptions.

"The affairs of the world are but a grand dream; drinking without fear of drunkenness, for not being drunk makes one a dreamer."

Chen Ping An said, "If you like it, then it’s yours."

Cao Qinglang shook his head with a smile, "I wouldn’t want to take away from your earnings."

Chen Ping An casually picked up another fan, waved it to create a refreshing breeze, and laughed, "Your master isn’t that kind of person."

Cao Qinglang asked, "Master, shall we carve some characters for the plain seal together?"

Chen Ping An immediately set down the folding fan and grinned, "Sure."

Cao Qinglang stifled a laugh, picking up a piece of pure white stone seal that had caught his eye, holding the carving knife, but then hesitated and quietly asked, "Master, carving characters and writing are quite different. I’ve never done this before. If I mess it up on my first try, won’t I just waste a seal?"

Chen Ping An’s thoughts stirred slightly. He summoned his flying sword, Fifteen, and held it nonchalantly, saying, "The material for the seal is just ordinary stone, something you can find scattered across the Sword Energy Great Wall. It’s not worth discussing whether it has value. But if you really mind, take your time carving it. A slow hand means fewer mistakes. Besides, the sword cultivators here are easy-going and don't fuss over minor flaws in the characters. As long as the meaning gets across, it’ll sell."

With one hand holding the "carving knife" Fifteen and the other gripping the seal, he planned to give one to Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian each while contemplating the inscription. He took a long time without carving.

Thus, it was Cao Qinglang, who was prepared with a draft in mind for his first carving, who took the initiative. After finishing the first character, he took a deep breath, paused for a moment, and looked up, finding his master still lost in thought.

Cao Qinglang lowered his head and continued carving.

There was something he had wanted to say to Pei Qian since their reunion, but as a young boy, he didn’t plan to tell his master, fearing it might be perceived as complaining or gossiping.

"If I hadn’t known how bad Pei Qian used to be, I wouldn’t understand how good she is now."

Regarding Pei Qian after their long separation, even if it was just about her height, the disparity from his imagination was quite surprising. At that time, he had already seen the graceful boy holding an umbrella at the street corner of the Lotus Blossom Paradise.

Upon their next encounter, Cao Qinglang was even more bewildered.

It wasn't until he accompanied Pei Qian to Xin Xiang Temple that he began to understand a little. Later, after arriving at Luopo Mountain, his confusion lessened as he gradually adapted to Pei Qian's unchanging nature as well as her changes. As for now, although he still hadn’t entirely grasped the reasons behind it, at least he no longer mistakenly believed that Pei Qian had occupied a body meant for a cultivator or had changed parts of her soul. Otherwise, how could she have undergone such a drastic change in temperament?

It was as if she had transitioned from one extreme to another.

The boy was observant and meticulous, and even during their long travels after leaving Luopo Mountain, he still harbored some small worries.

Then came the discourse between master and disciple atop the city wall.

This finally put the boy’s mind at ease.

At this moment, however, Cao Qinglang suddenly felt a bit guilty, realizing that while he claimed not to complain, he had indeed been gossiping about Pei Qian behind her back.

Cao Qinglang took a deep breath and focused again, continuing to carve.

Unknowingly, the alley orphan from back then had transformed into a young scholar, free-spirited and charming.

Cao Qinglang planned to gift this seal to his master.

Chen Ping An still hadn't decided what to inscribe, so he set the plain seal aside, retracted the flying sword Fifteen into his energy abode, and turned to write on the fan.

Cao Qinglang raised his head and gazed at Chen Ping An, lingering without retracting his gaze.

Chen Ping An did not look up but sensed the boy's unusualness and smiled, "What’s wrong? Did you carve it wrong? If so, we can switch seals and start over. But if you’re willing, you can keep the one you messed up; don’t throw it away."

"I didn’t mess up."

Cao Qinglang shook his head, his silence stretching out. He mumbled, "Meeting you, Master, I feel very fortunate."

Chen Ping An was momentarily dumbfounded and then chuckled, still not looking up. He pondered for a moment and nodded to himself, saying, "I’m very happy to meet my student as well."

Cao Qinglang continued to focus intently on carving.

Chen Ping An finished writing on the fan and turned to ask, "What did you carve?"

Cao Qinglang quickly raised a hand to cover the seal, saying, "I haven't finished yet; you'll know later, Master."

Chen Ping An chuckled. This student was certainly different from his current senior disciple, who was busy flattering him.

Cao Qinglang sat upright, his expression focused, carving with utmost care. With a calm mind and steady hands, he inscribed characters with the carving knife gifted by his master.

The next time they parted, he planned to present this seal to his master.

Cao Qinglang had yet to finish carving. Midway, he closed his eyes, envisioning a beautiful picture he had long imagined, and whatever he thought of became what he wrote.

"Master sits alone, the spring breeze flipping through books."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 713: A Lion's Roar in Words

A new-faced young man entered the tavern, ordering a jug of the cheapest wine. Today, business was exceptionally slow—an unusual occurrence.

The young man, dressed in white and strikingly beautiful like a celestial being, was fortunate to find an empty table. However, his complexion appeared slightly pale, as if he were unwell.

Zhang Jiazhen brought over the wine jug and a bowl, along with a plate of pickled vegetables, telling the guest to wait a moment. Soon, he would also be served a bowl of free plain noodles.

The young man opened the wine jug and took a strong sniff. Then, holding the wine bowl, he glanced at the pickled vegetables, lifted his head, and asked in a thick dialect from the Sword Qi Great Wall, "Such a large wine bowl, such fragrant celestial wine, and pickled vegetables and plain noodles that are free to eat?! Is this really not a small amount of summer coins, but merely a snowflake coin?! Is there truly a tavern in the world that conducts business like this? Let me make it clear to you, I have high cultivation and an even greater backing. If you think you can trick me, you have another thing coming."

Zhang Jiazhen had heard many complaints from drunkards about the low price of the wine, but this was the first time someone was unhappy it was too cheap. It must be one of those outsiders from the Haoran World, he thought. Otherwise, in his hometown, even if it were a Sword Immortal drinking or highborn youths from Tai Xiang Street or Xuan Hu Street, they would only complain about the price being too high or the taste of the wine being poor. Zhang Jiazhen smiled and said, "Rest assured, it's truly only a snowflake coin."

The young man pushed the wine jug away slightly, hands tucked in his sleeves, shaking his head. "I can't drink this wine; it's too cheap. It must be a scam!"

An old Sword Cultivator sitting at a nearby table took the opportunity, since there weren't many customers around, to sit beside the young man with an empty wine bowl in hand. He smiled and said, "You, young outsider, although you speak our language, look unfamiliar. If you don't want to drink, so be it. I'll pay for this jug of wine."

Upon hearing this, the young man pressed down on the wine jug. "You say you’ll buy it, but do I look like someone who lacks money?"

The old Sword Cultivator sighed internally. The second shopkeeper always had an eye for the ruthless; how did he end up choosing such a naive newcomer? The old Sword Cultivator could only ask, "Little friend, you must be one of us, right? Sigh, look at you trying to help out. Your words are too obvious. Is this your own idea? Surely, the second shopkeeper didn’t teach you to say these things."

Sure enough, an old drunkard who preferred squatting on the roadside rather than sitting at tables sneered. "Where did that heartless second shopkeeper find this naive helper? Is this your first time doing something morally questionable? The second shopkeeper didn’t give you any warnings? Well, it's true, now that he’s making a fortune from the gods, he probably doesn’t have time to cultivate a ‘wine scammer’ anymore. I find it strange that we only have gamblers here; now that the second shopkeeper is involved, it’s like he’s opening a sect..."

At this point, the old gambler, who had just lost a large sum of money, turned to the young man and said, "Diedong, I wasn’t talking about you. Were it not for you being the head shopkeeper, even Old Liu would be too poor to drink water and still wouldn’t want to come to this place."

Diedong chuckled, not taking offense. In Chen Ping'an’s words, it was fine for customers to criticize the second shopkeeper; the more they complained, the more they drank. However, those who complained once and never returned were merely making a scene for the sake of it, and he would have to remember their names or faces. In the future, he would need to find a chance to make amends and let bygones be bygones with a smile.

Before long, another customer at a nearby table shook his head and said, "I think our second shopkeeper is indeed a bit unscrupulous, but he’s not completely foolish. I suspect this is a hired scammer from another tavern, deliberately trying to make things difficult for the second shopkeeper. Here, let me toast you a bowl of wine. Though your methods are a bit clumsy, for your young age, you have quite the courage to challenge the second shopkeeper. You deserve this toast."

At that moment, the head shopkeeper Diedong happened to pass by the table and lightly tapped the surface with his finger.

The customer, feeling a bit embarrassed, put down his wine bowl and forced a smile. "Diedong, we have nothing against you. We just pity that the head shopkeeper has met with such misfortune. Forget it, I’ll drink this bowl myself."

After this customer took a sip, he felt wronged. Hadn’t he received a personal lesson from the second shopkeeper? Behind the scenes, he had gotten his hands on the second shopkeeper’s cunning strategies, relying solely on the celestial saying of "over white is black, over black is white, black and white switch, gods find it hard to measure."

However, this man thought again; it didn’t matter. Every time the second shopkeeper discreetly took the lead, he had made a profit. Afterwards, he would secretly share the spoils, not that it was a division of wealth. As for how much would be given in the end, it was a strange rule—only the second shopkeeper had the final say. This kind of "friend" only needed to collect the money, as the second shopkeeper had made it clear from the start: if given too much, there was no need for thanks, just pay more to drink here. If given less, there was no need to complain; sharing the spoils was a matter of kindness, and not sharing was simply expected. Whoever didn’t value this would need to be careful walking the night road, especially in the dark, drunk and dazed—who hadn’t stumbled a bit?

Drinking in this small tavern without some cunning was truly unwise.

However, over time, drinking had become quite interesting. For instance, now those in the tavern enjoyed exchanging glances, looking for clues, attempting to discern whether one was friend or foe.

This man felt he was among the second shopkeeper's various wine scammers, one of the higher-ranked, with greater cultivation and insight. Otherwise, the second shopkeeper wouldn’t hint that he should let trusted friends handle the bets, specifically betting on who was a scammer and who wasn’t. Such money was not meant for outsiders. As for what was real and what was fake within, it didn’t matter; it wouldn’t let certain insiders, who had to temporarily stop working, suffer losses. It guaranteed that after their identities were exposed, they could still receive a hefty “compensation,” while allowing some friends to hide deeper. As for how the gamblers made money, it was quite simple; they would collaborate with certain non-friends who were Sword Immortals, using their genuine connections and reputation to create confusion. In short, it would never harm the reputation of the one managing the bets or the gambling.

The reasoning was simple: all transactions in this world are not good deals. As cultivators, we are all Sword Immortals; time is long, and character must be solid.

Aside from the last words of the second shopkeeper, this man had truly been too embarrassed to agree with anything else, but he still found all the previous remarks to be quite insightful.

As he drank the wine and basked in the sunlight, he couldn’t help but feel that while he initially thought the wine was cheap and affordable, he now genuinely found the bamboo sea cave wine to be quite good.

Cui Dongshan pulled out a snowflake coin and gently placed it on the table before beginning to drink.

If one were to probe into the subtleties of human hearts, not to mention the drunken gamblers present, even his teacher Chen Ping'an would never dare claim to be comparable to his student Cui Dongshan.

In time, the hearts of men can only be filled themselves, but never can they fill others.

In the year and more since his teacher had arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, his actions seemed disorganized. However, in Cui Dongshan's view, they were quite simple, without a trace of muddled intentions.

It was merely about false appearances and borrowing strength.

This was a different person from the teacher at the Book Scroll Lake before.

**False Appearances.**

It referred to the tavern, the wine, the pickled vegetables, the plain noodles, the couplets, and the wall full of idle signs. The Hundred Sword Immortal Seal, the Bi Sword Immortal Seal, and the folding fans.

**Borrowed Strength.**

It involved the four guardians, including Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji, Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo, the entirety of Ningfu, and the titles of disciples from the Confucian Sage, the senior brothers, as well as all the Sword Immortals who came to drink here and inscribe words on the idle signs, and the many sword cultivators. It included the noble women of the Central Earth’s aristocracy as well as all those from the Sword Qi Great Wall who spent money to buy seals and fans.

By accomplishing these two things, one could not only ensure their own safety but also do a bit more.

**Self-Preservation** meant safeguarding one’s life and also guarding one’s original intent. Whether one wishes to reflect on their every word and action to see if it harms the world is a matter of great difference between people. Not wishing to think about these things wouldn’t necessarily harm others, but those who wished to reflect would naturally do better.

In Cui Dongshan's view, his teacher still remained on the level of good breeding good and evil breeding evil, going around in circles, appearing to be trapped in a wall of ghosts, suffering with worries and fears, but that was a good thing.

As for the possibility of good breeding evil and evil breeding good, his teacher had yet to think deeply about it. Back at the ancestral home outside Mud Bottle Alley, why had his student mentioned the ghost bride, intentionally complicating a simple matter and letting it grow wild with tangles, making things difficult for his teacher? Cui Dongshan was not someone who had nothing better to do; he had a purpose, and though his teacher knew his intentions were not bad, he still remained unaware of the deeper meaning.

But that was fine; as long as his teacher walked steadily, what harm was there in taking it slow? With every gesture, a clear breeze would enter the sleeves, and the bright moon would rest upon his shoulders.

**To Benefit Others**, one cannot merely give to others; there must never be an implication of charity. Otherwise, what good is it if one gives freely? Others may not necessarily keep it, but it only increases karma.

**To Benefit the World**, at the Sword Qi Great Wall, one must rely on destiny or see whether the wild world agrees.

One must not stray from their original intent, grasp the measure, proceed step by step, think without loopholes, do their best, have gains and losses, and act deftly.

At first glance, it all seemed quite thought-provoking.

In the end, is Teacher Chen Ping'an more like Qi Jingchun or more like Cui Zhan?

Why did that old bastard Cui Zhan later create a situation at Book Scroll Lake to test his heart, attempting to pull against Qi Jingchun to determine the true victor?

Was it not because he had his eyes on his student Cui Dongshan’s teacher, who seemed to have become a true peer with Cui Zhan as he walked along?

Isn't that the most interesting thing in the world? Thus, Cui Zhan intended to prevent the deceased Qi Jingchun from conceding, but in his heart, he could openly reclaim a victory, wondering if Qi Jingchun ever considered that after all the picking, he merely chose another "brother Cui Zhan"?

At that point, Cui Zhan could ridicule Qi Jingchun for contemplating for an entire century in Liyu Cave, ultimately concluding that the one who could "save oneself and others" wasn’t Qi Jingchun, but rather people like Cui Zhan himself. Who won or lost was evident.

Why did the old scholar earlier want to separate the bastard Cui Zhan from my Cui Dongshan's soul? Was it not to pay him back in his own coin? Letting Cui Zhan know his thoughts was still not entirely correct?

Perhaps this was the old scholar's secret chess strategy, hidden and not shown to anyone for a lifetime.

And that Pei Qian, who came from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, was of course also the old scholar's unreasonable hand.

Cui Dongshan had a bowl of wine, picked up a piece of pickled vegetables, and found it slightly too salty. His teacher was still too kind, wasting salt.

**Observing the Dao.**

The old scholar hoped his closed-door disciple would only observe the goodness and evil of human hearts.

But it was far more than that.

Knowing the goodness and evil of human hearts, what of it? His teacher, Cui Dongshan, was already on a path that opposed himself, realizing that knowing merely meant knowing, and while the benefits would be great, they still wouldn’t be enough.

The old scholar's true intentions were to hope he would see more of the speed of human hearts, extending into countless possibilities. The good and the bad involved more complex and profound matters, seemingly more unreasonable goodness breeding evil and evil breeding goodness.

This touched on an old matter from years ago.

Back then, Qi Jingchun no longer wanted to play chess with his senior brother Cui Zhan, so he went to ask his teacher if there was a chess game where both sides could win.

At that time, the old scholar was drinking alone, just having secretly put one leg off the bench, preparing the teacher's stance when he heard this question and burst into laughter, choking several times, unsure whether he was happy or if the wine had gone down the wrong way, almost bringing him to tears.

At that time, a large fool was coveting the wine on the teacher's table and casually said, "If you don’t play chess, you won’t lose; not losing is winning—this is the same as not spending money is making money."

The old scholar, wary of the large fool stealing the wine, replied, "As long as your chess skills are high enough, even if I win, I can lose without anyone knowing; that counts as winning."

Cui Zhan sat on the threshold, leaning against the door, smiling and saying, "Only under the premise of not breaking the rules, and with an infinitely large chessboard, could such a possibility exist; otherwise, don't think about it."

At that moment, the only young man in a blue shirt standing in the room only gazed at his teacher.

The old scholar smiled and said, "This question is a bit large; if I want to answer well, I must think a bit more."

Qi Jingchun nodded and said, "I implore the teacher to finish the wine quickly."

The implication was that once the teacher finished the wine, he should have an answer.

The old scholar nodded with confidence, but as soon as he finished the wine, he swayed and pretended to be drunk before taking a nap.

Cui Dongshan set down his chopsticks, looked at the square table that resembled a chessboard, glanced at the wine jug and bowls, sighed softly, and stood up to leave.

At the gate of Ningfu, a young man in white, holding an ordinary green bamboo walking stick, gently knocked on the door.

Nalan Ye Xing opened the door.

The young man smiled and said, "Grandpa Nalan, your teacher must often speak of me, I am Dongshan."

Nalan Ye Xing only knew this person was the student of his son-in-law, but truly didn’t realize he was handsome yet somewhat dim-witted—what a pity.

The son-in-law had previously brought in those two disciples and students, who appeared quite good.

After Nalan Ye Xing closed the door, Cui Dongshan, looking perplexed, said, "Grandpa Nalan, it's clear you have the potential of a transcendent sword cultivator, but why are you still in the Jade Purity realm? Did you get ambushed by that ancient monster that hasn’t appeared in a thousand years, injuring you personally? How come this isn’t circulating in the Haoran world?"

Nalan Ye Xing, smiling, didn’t bother to argue with a dim-witted kid.

Cui Dongshan shook his sleeves, pulled out an ancient, round, yellowed bead, and handed it to Nalan Ye Xing. "What a coincidence, I found this pill by the roadside. It might be difficult for you to return to the transcendent realm, but it could perhaps repair your Jade Purity realm."

Nalan Ye Xing glanced at it but couldn't discern its depth. It was too polite to accept, yet too light to need to be courteous, so he smiled and said, "I appreciate it; please take it back."

Cui Dongshan didn’t withdraw his hand and added with a smile, "It was picked up on Caicun Road in the White Emperor City."

Nalan Ye Xing swiftly snatched the pill from the young man’s hand, hid it in his sleeve, and thought it better to store it in his bosom. He grumbled, "Dongshan, you are truly something else. Why send gifts to Grandpa Nalan? It feels so distant."

Cui Dongshan looked surprised and extended his hand. "Does that seem distant? Have I overstayed my welcome? Then give it back."

Nalan Ye Xing gently pushed the young man’s hand away, speaking earnestly, "Dongshan, see, isn’t it more distant this way?"

The young man seemed persuaded by the elder's words, turned, and ran to the gate of Ningfu, opened it himself, and then turned around, extending his hand. "Give it back."

Nalan Ye Xing gasped, realizing he had no doubt: this was indeed the favored student of his son-in-law, perhaps even one who had received all the true teachings.

Nalan Ye Xing pretended to be deaf and blind, turned, and left. This Ningfu was a place one could come and go as they pleased, with doors that loved to close.

Cui Dongshan entered, closed the door, and quickly followed Nalan Ye Xing, whispering, "Grandpa Nalan, now you know who I am, right?"

Nalan Ye Xing smiled, "Dongshan, you must be the most promising student of your son-in-law, right?"

Cui Dongshan said with regret, "I can only lament that I only picked up one along Caicun Road in the White Emperor City."

In an instant, Cui Dongshan raised two fingers to the side of his head.

Nalan Ye Xing chuckled, "With that, I can rest assured."

Cui Dongshan withdrew his hand and softly said, "Please, Grandpa Nalan, don’t spread word of my being a transcendent realm cultivator. I fear the Sword Immortals will look down on my low realm and embarrass my teacher."

Nalan Ye Xing felt somewhat exhausted. It wasn't the pill itself, but rather the actions and demeanor of Cui Dongshan after their meeting; he couldn’t predict a single one.

After all, when he had brandished his flying sword to intimidate the young man, if the other party had a high enough realm, they could completely ignore it or exert themselves to counter it.

But this guy chose to reach out to block it, deliberately slowing down, his two fingers touching the hilt of the sword, not the blade or tip.

Nalan Ye Xing was worried.

Cui Dongshan walked alongside the elder, observing their surroundings, casually saying, "Since I am the student of the teacher, are you worried about me being too bad, or are you worried about my teacher not being good enough? Do you trust me, Cui Dongshan, to be dim-witted, or do you trust my son-in-law’s thoughts? Are you worried about this outsider being clouded and obscure, or are you concerned about the Ningfu’s foundation, the Sword Immortals within and outside Ningfu, not being able to break through the clouds? Should a down-and-out upper fifth realm sword cultivator trust his sword’s lethality, or trust that his sword heart is clear and pure enough? Isn’t it true that after I say all this, those who originally believed may not believe so much anymore?"

Nalan Ye Xing's expression grew serious.

Cui Dongshan sighed, "Those with great strength often think they can save effort in dealing with the world; this isn’t very good."

Nalan Ye Xing frowned deeply.

Cui Dongshan glanced at the Dragon Slaying Cliff not far away. "With my teacher here, there are no worries. Grandpa Nalan, we brothers must cherish each other."

Nalan Ye Xing remained silent on the way.

Upon reaching his son-in-law’s residence, Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang were also present. Cui Dongshan bowed his thanks, addressing Nalan Ye Xing as Grandpa.

Nalan Ye Xing nodded with a smile and said to Chen Ping'an, who was rising inside the house, "Just now, Dongshan and I hit it off; he almost called me brother."

Chen Ping'an smiled and nodded, "Alright, Grandpa Nalan, I understand."

Pei Qian secretly gave a thumbs-up to the big white goose at the door.

Cui Dongshan looked perplexed, saying, "Grandpa Nalan, I didn’t say that."

Nalan Ye Xing smiled, "In the end, does your teacher believe more in me, Grandpa Nalan, or in you, Brother Cui?"

Cui Dongshan covered his forehead with one hand, swaying slightly. "I drank too much wine at the tavern just now. What did I say? Where am I? Who am I…"

Pei Qian, who had just put her thumb down, raised it again, both thumbs up.

Nalan Ye Xing left, feeling quite relaxed.

Chen Ping'an shot a glare at Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan sat on the threshold. "Teacher, allow me to sit here and enjoy the cool breeze, waking up from the wine."

Chen Ping'an resumed his position and continued writing on a fan, while Cao Qinglang assisted.

Pei Qian wanted to help but was not permitted by her teacher. 

So she sat alone at a nearby table, facing the door and the big white goose, winking at him and pointing at the two gifts presented by her teacher.

Pei Qian did not hold back with her teacher, straightforwardly choosing two gifts: a string of beads made of unknown material, carved with one hundred and eight people, antique and elegant. 

A pair of chess jars; upon opening the lid of the jar containing white pieces, it emitted an aura of clouds and mist, while the jar containing black pieces was shrouded in thick clouds, faintly reminiscent of an old dragon bringing rain.

The beads were numerous, and the pieces inside the jars were even more. What mattered was not the quality but the quantity; Pei Qian always believed that her family’s wealth should be measured by volume.

Next time she faced Li Huai in a battle of wits, how could Li Huai possibly win?

Cui Dongshan smiled and nodded, raising a hand to gently mimic a clapping gesture. Pei Qian, having long understood him well, raised her hand and clapped back.

Pei Qian sat cross-legged on the long bench, swaying her head and shoulders.

Chen Ping'an, with his back to Pei Qian, said, "Sit properly; have you forgotten?"

Pei Qian immediately froze, as if under a spell.

Cui Dongshan leaned against the door, smiling as he looked at the three inside.

Pei Qian was enjoying herself.

Now, whenever she encountered a temple, she would bow to the Bodhisattva.

She often visited the Heart-Mind Temple in the capital city of the Southern Garden Kingdom, but for some reason, when she clasped her hands together, they didn’t press tightly together, as if she were carefully cradling something.

It was also heard from Zhong Qiu that she now had her first friend who was no longer just a friend. Of course, this wasn’t her current good friends Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Milu, nor was it the old chef Old Wei or Xiao Bai, but rather a girl born and raised in the capital of the Southern Garden Kingdom who had married a few years ago. Before leaving the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, she sought her out to apologize, but that girl seemed to have neither accepted nor rejected Pei Qian’s apology. Even though she recognized Pei Qian’s unchanged appearance and height, the wealthy girl pretended not to recognize her, out of fear.

After Pei Qian left, she secretly found Zhong Qiu and asked him to help her with something, to which Zhong Qiu agreed. Pei Qian then asked if this was the right thing to do, and Zhong Qiu replied that it wasn’t wrong, but he also didn’t say it was good, nor did he say if this act could truly amend her mistake. He only suggested she ask her teacher.

At that time, Pei Qian said she still didn’t dare to say this and would wait until she had more courage, until her teacher liked her a bit more before she dared to speak up.

Cao Qinglang was focused on writing. 

He was very much like someone.

Whatever he did, he was always serious.

Thus, he needed someone to teach him what things could actually be taken lightly and not to get caught up in trivial matters.

It remained unknown whether Cao Qinglang understood why his teacher, who was a wandering burden, was willing to be so serious, and how much of that seriousness stemmed from guilt towards him, even though the hardships in Cao Qinglang’s life had nothing to do with his teacher.

Many things and many words, Cui Dongshan wouldn’t say much more. With his teacher imparting knowledge and solving doubts, the students and disciples could simply listen and observe.

As for his teacher, he was probably still thinking about how to make money.

The three inside the room were actually quite alike in one matter.

That was when parents departed for distant lands and never returned; they were all still children back then.

Teacher's parents left the earliest, then Pei Qian, and then Cao Qinglang.

The three inside the room must have once been reluctant to grow up but had no choice but to mature.

Thus, Cui Dongshan chose not to enter the room, preferring to sit on the threshold, placing the walking stick across his knees, taking a rare moment to steal a break and daydream.

Chen Ping'an suddenly slammed the table, startling both Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian, who jumped in shock. Then they heard their teacher, their master, laughing in exasperation, "The one who writes the best is actually the laziest?!"

Cao Qinglang looked bewildered, nodding, "That makes sense."

Pei Qian slammed the table, "That’s utterly outrageous!"

Cui Dongshan hurriedly stood up, holding his walking stick as he stepped over the threshold, "Alright!"

Chen Ping'an stood up and sat beside Pei Qian, smiling, "Master will teach you how to play chess."

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, opened the chess jar, and extended both hands, gently shaking them, "Alright! The big white goose… what is it? It's Little Senior Brother! Little Senior Brother taught me how to play chess, and I'm very slow at it. Now, if I get ten pieces, I can win against him."

Chen Ping'an’s smile remained unchanged, but he had just sat down before standing again, "Then let’s play later; Master has to go write. What are you dawdling for? Hurry and bring that little book box over; it’s time to copy books!"

Pei Qian exclaimed, "Oh!" and sped out.

Before long, she returned carrying the small bamboo box.

Yet she found her teacher standing at the door, looking at her.

Pei Qian suddenly halted at the door, looking up in confusion, "Are you waiting for me, Teacher?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Remember when someone carried a bucket to fetch water? They weren't this quick."

Pei Qian looked somewhat flustered.

Chen Ping'an reached out and ruffled her hair, laughing, "Your Master and Cao Qinglang could wait for you to return home back then, so of course, they can wait more now."

Cui Dongshan raised his head, lamenting, "I was the one who knew the teacher the earliest!"

Pei Qian immediately laughed and said, "I’m a bit earlier than Cao Qinglang!"

Cao Qinglang turned to look at the door, simply smiling.

Pei Qian then said to the big white goose, "Is it meaningful to compete over this? Huh?!"

Cui Dongshan raised both hands, "Senior Sister is right."

Chen Ping'an slapped Pei Qian’s head, "Go copy the books."

In the end, it was Chen Ping'an sitting on the threshold, taking out the sword-raising gourd, and starting to drink.

Inside, the three looked at the back figure at the door, each busy with their own matters.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, "Cao Qinglang, I’ll help you make a walking stick later."

Cao Qinglang turned back, "Teacher, I already have one."

Chen Ping'an didn’t turn back, smiling, "But that’s not a gift from the teacher. If you don’t mind, you can take the one from the room across the hall."

Cao Qinglang thought for a moment, "As long as it’s not a straw sandal, it’ll do."

Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes, muttering, "People can be infuriating."

Pei Qian paused her writing, taking a break, and secretly made a face, muttering, "This is infuriating, this is infuriating."

Then Pei Qian glanced at the small bamboo box on the table, feeling quite pleased; after all, the little book box was something only she possessed.

Chen Ping'an, with his back to the three, squinted happily, gazing through the courtyard towards the sky. Today’s bamboo sea cave wine was still delightful. Such fine wine shouldn’t be put on credit.

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine, one hand holding the wine jug and the other gently patting his knee, murmuring, "The poor child has a pearl in his clothes, originally round and clear."

Cui Dongshan smiled, as if speaking to himself, "He won’t seek for himself, yet counts others' treasures. Counting others' treasures brings no benefit; please listen to my words."

Cao Qinglang also smiled knowingly, softly continuing, "Filth does not stain, light is naturally clear; it cannot help but arise from the heart, and when one speaks, it becomes a lion's roar."

Pei Qian paused her writing, perked up her ears; she felt a bit wronged. She didn’t know what her teacher and the others were talking about, having certainly never read it; otherwise, she would definitely remember.

Pei Qian sighed, "Then I suppose stinky tofu is good to eat."

Chen Ping'an’s eyes lit up, and he slapped his knee heavily, laughing loudly, "Plain noodles can be free, but this stinky tofu must be charged!"

For the next twenty days, Pei Qian was not very happy because Cui Dongshan dragged her all around Ningfu, and Cao Qinglang was also tagging along.

The three of them wandered through the streets and alleys of the city, took a distant look at the mirage, and then headed south. The big white goose liked to take detours, passing by the houses where Sword Immortals once lived, before finally reaching the city wall, still walking on foot. If the teacher were here, not to mention walking, even climbing would be fine. But since the teacher wasn’t there, Pei Qian had suggested several times to summon a talisman boat to see the ground from above for a clearer view. However, Cui Dongshan didn’t agree, and Cao Qinglang beside him showed no interest, merely remaining silent, making Pei Qian feel somewhat outnumbered.

Cao Qinglang originally intended to focus on cultivating in Ningfu, just like Zhong Qiu, who now strolled leisurely in the practice ground for several hours.

But when Cui Dongshan knocked on the door to call him out, Cao Qinglang wanted to refuse, for his teacher had specifically chosen this place for him to cultivate, and he couldn’t let down his teacher’s intentions.

Yet Cui Dongshan shook his head, making his meaning clear. After a bit of thought, Cao Qinglang consented. Cui Dongshan reminded him to bring the walking stick gifted by his teacher, and Cao Qinglang took the one that had accompanied his teacher through mountains and waters, covering half of Northern Jiulu Prefecture. Cui Dongshan also had one, a common green bamboo, yet it was not ordinary. Pei Qian’s walking stick was relatively the best quality and most valuable. After the big white goose revealed the mystery, Pei Qian finally gave up the idea of bringing the small bamboo box with her.

On the city wall, Pei Qian walked along the southern side, seeing many interesting Sword Immortals: some in colorful clothing taking walks, others wearing swords not at their waist, with swords unsheathed, the tassels on the swords long, one end tied at their waist, the long swords dragging on the ground, the tips and edges scraping against the city wall, their sword energy flowing visibly, making Pei Qian want to look more but hesitate.

As they walked at a higher location, Cao Qinglang gazed at Cui Dongshan, who smiled and said, "Here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, height is merely about the sword."

Only then did Cao Qinglang abandon the thought of jumping down from the city wall onto the walkway.

Cui Dongshan encouraged Pei Qian, saying it was fine to look more; the elegance of the Sword Immortals was a rare sight in the Haoran world, and the great Sword Immortals wouldn’t mind.

With that, Pei Qian felt brave enough to look a few more times.

The colorful-clothed Sword Immortal merely lowered his head in thought, clearly not minding a little girl’s gaze, nor did he mind the three walking on high ground.

Cui Dongshan naturally recognized this person’s roots: Wu Chengpei, a Sword Cultivator at the bottleneck of the Jade Purity realm, whose life sword was named "Sweet Dew," the sword arts best suited for finishing moves, for a simple reason—there was much blood on the ground.

Wu Chengpei was reclusive in nature, appearing young in looks while actually being quite old. His partner had been crushed by a great demon, the head smashed, the soul devoured when that big mouth opened wide.

Later, that great demon was severely injured on the battlefield, hiding in the wilderness, unwilling to show up again. Wu Chengpei had once struggled between living alone for the rest of his life or dying without meaning. Later, that demon was killed, and its head was tossed at Wu Chengpei’s feet, who only smiled and said, "As a courtesy, please drink with me."

The three also encountered an elderly Sword Immortal seemingly engaging in a duel while drinking, sitting cross-legged. With one hand forming sword seals, the elder faced northwards, with a mysterious entity, whether lightning or sword light, spanning between the north and south city walls, as thick as the iron chains of the Longquan County wells. The sword light was brilliant, sparks flying everywhere, with constant flashes of lightning striking the city wall walkway, like hundreds of spiritual snakes moving, ultimately disappearing into the grass.

Pei Qian was too frightened to advance, and the elder said, "Do you know the rules here? If there’s wine, you may pass; if not, you must defeat me in swordsmanship or ride your sword out of the city wall and obediently take the long way around."

Cui Dongshan smiled and replied, "My teacher is that second shopkeeper."

"With such an unprincipled upper beam, the lower beam is surprisingly not crooked either. Strange, strange."

The elder then angrily declared, "Then that will cost you two jugs of wine!"

Cui Dongshan laughed and tossed two jugs of wine to the elder Sword Immortal.

The elder, named Zhao Ge Yi, was facing Cheng Quan, a former Yuan Ying Sword Cultivator who had fallen from the Jade Purity realm. The two were bitter rivals. 

Except for occasions like today, where Zhao Ge Yi suppressed his realm and both clashed their sword energies, the two old men, born in the same alley, would also argue across the walkway, and rumors said they would secretly drink together and spat at each other.

Having received the wine, Sword Immortal Zhao Ge Yi slightly raised his hand, lifting the sword energy that had blocked the way, and irritably said, "In light of the wine,"

Cui Dongshan and the others jumped down from the city wall and walked slowly ahead. Cao Qinglang looked up, observing the thick stream of sword energy above as if it were a river. The boy’s face was illuminated by the light, shining brilliantly.

Pei Qian hid beside Cui Dongshan, tugging at the sleeve of the big white goose. "Let’s hurry."

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "Senior Sister, don’t embarrass your teacher."

Pei Qian tightened her grip on her walking stick, trembling slightly, adopting a posture of walking confidently like a demon, albeit with somewhat stiff movements.

After passing the stream above, they walked far enough that a terrified Pei Qian kicked the big white goose's calf.

Clearly, the force was not great, yet the big white goose was kicked off the ground, falling and curling up, rolling on the floor.

Pei Qian and the big white goose had known each other for a long time, so she was not worried at all. Almost instantly, she turned to look at Cao Qinglang.

Cao Qinglang stared ahead, "I didn’t see anything."

Pei Qian let out a sigh of relief and then cheerfully asked, "Did you see that little fish in the stream just now? It was small, one golden one and one green one?"

Cao Qinglang shook his head.

Pei Qian pouted, "Heh, still a cultivator."

Cao Qinglang didn’t take it to heart.

As for his own potential, Cao Qinglang was well aware. Why did the demon Ding Ying reside near the top scholar’s alley? Why did he ultimately choose to settle at Cao Qinglang’s home? Teacher Zhong had long explained the details to him. Ding Ying had initially guessed several "cultivating seeds" in the capital of the Southern Garden Kingdom, which was the hiding place of the Grand Master of the Mirror Heart Studio, and Cao Qinglang was one of them.

Back then, the spiritual energy in his hometown was sparse, and the only ones who could be considered true cultivators were the first person beneath Ding Ying, the sword cultivator Yu Zhenyi, who returned to youth. But since he could be regarded as a cultivating seed, Cao Qinglang wouldn’t belittle himself, nor would he be overly proud. In fact, later, when the Lotus Flower Blessed Land was split into four, heavenly dew fell, and spiritual energy poured down like rain, many cultivating seeds that had been floating in the river of time began to take root and sprout in the suitable soil.

However, as the old scholar Lu had once said when secretly teaching him celestial techniques, having the innate talent bestowed by heaven and earth is just the first step. Getting the opportunity to stand at the foot of the mountain is the second step, and thereafter, there are millions of steps to climb. As long as one walks steadily enough, there is hope to find Chen Ping'an, and a chance to thank him, asking if he, Cao Qinglang, could walk the path of the great Dao alongside him in the coming century or millennium.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 714: The Master Unleashes His Sword, While the Junior Brother Plays Chess**

Cui Dongshan cast a glance at Pei Qian, who was nominally the eldest senior sister. 

Pei Qian had the innate ability to read the hearts of others, but Cui Dongshan was not limited to that. He could not only see the hearts of people but also delve into the depths of their thoughts, places even they were unaware of. 

Pei Qian’s memory was remarkable; she trained in martial arts, mastering the “Eighteen Stops of Sword Qi.” Later, while copying texts, she grasped profound principles without even realizing it, and she even learned to play chess from him on the cross-ocean ferry. 

It became evident that as long as Pei Qian was willing to pursue something, she could excel beyond anyone else. Whatever she truly wanted to learn, she would grasp it rapidly. 

But that was not her greatest skill. 

Pei Qian's true strength lay in her ability to sever her thoughts and set her own barriers on the path of her heart, refusing to dwell on anything too deeply. “If I don’t wish to think about it, then thoughts won’t come,” was her most evident manifestation. After she acknowledged her master and became his disciple, especially upon arriving at the Abandoned Mountain, Pei Qian seemed to stagnate in her growth—both in height and temperament—almost as if she had “settled” there. 

She remained small, perpetually resembling a little charcoal briquette. 

Thus, her carefree nature was genuinely carefree. 

However, when it came to paths unrelated to her barriers, Pei Qian's thoughts would often soar to astonishing heights, traversing thousands of miles in an instant, as if boundless and unrestricted by the heavens and earth. 

Could the heart of a wild monkey and a galloping horse be restrained or bound? For cultivators, it was a trepidation akin to that of a weak scholar, staggering through the myriad dangers of the path, where many bandits lay in hiding. But for Pei Qian, such concerns were entirely absent. 

After practicing her punches, a dramatic transformation occurred; she began to grow taller, advancing without hesitation. 

This was evidently another extreme. 

It was wonderful, yet it concealed considerable trouble and potential hazards. Because in Pei Qian's heart, the “great Pei Qian” was merely the “disciple Pei Qian” in her master’s eyes. 

Thus, to some extent, Pei Qian’s state was not a genuine state, nor was her heart truly sincere. 

She had progressed too quickly along her path, like riding clouds, and atop the lake of her heart, there was only a tower in the air yet to touch the ground. 

If it were not for her master, who intentionally accompanied her on foot, crossing mountains and rivers, each of them carefully holding a walking staff and a bamboo box, placing one or two simple principles and humble rules into her “little heart’s book box,” Pei Qian might explode like a firecracker at any moment. The more she learned martial arts and walked further along the martial path, the greater the potential for her explosive power. One day, she might poke a massive hornet’s nest, endangering herself and others. 

Now, Pei Qian had changed significantly, so her master was no longer afraid of her making mistakes on her own. Even if she wandered the world alone, he was not overly concerned about her actively harming others. Instead, he feared that others would err, and if their mistakes were indeed glaringly obvious, Pei Qian might not be able to restrain herself and would crush their minor faults with her own major mistakes. That was the most distressing outcome. 

Transmitting the Dao to disciples was no simple task. 

The vast world was complex, filled with life and death, and it was not merely the clamor of rural life. There could be earth-shattering disasters, violent upheavals, and many unforeseen events that even Chen Pingan found hard to judge as right or wrong. Once Pei Qian encountered such situations, how could Chen Pingan truly feel at ease? 

For the sake of this major disciple, her master had indeed put in considerable effort to cultivate his heart. 

They quickly passed a group of sword cultivators practicing their techniques on the ground, and Pei Qian's keen eyes spotted a woman from the Central Plains named Yu Juanfu, sitting on the road before the city walls. Yu Juanfu wasn't training; she simply sat there chewing on a flatbread. 

Cui Dongshan cradled the back of his head with both hands, puffing out his chest, walking with an air of indifference, no less impressive than the eldest senior sister’s trademark stance. 

Pei Qian had no idea what the big white goose was thinking; perhaps she was pretending not to be scared upon encountering so many sword cultivators. 

Pei Qian actually thought favorably of Yu Juanfu. The reason was simple; when Yu Juanfu had lost a sparring match, her master had pressed her head against the wall, and she hadn’t gotten angry at all. 

If only Cen Yuanji and Bai Shou had such a broad mind. 

The city wall was wide enough; Yu Juanfu did not raise her head but gazed towards the vastness of the southern sky. 

Their group, each holding a walking staff, passed by in sequence. 

Not far from Yu Juanfu, a boy was reading a book. 

Pei Qian frowned. 

Seated on a cushion, the sword cultivator Yan Lü, who was listening to the teachings of the sword immortal Ku Xia, glanced at the three on the city wall but did not look again. 

It was said he was a companion of Chen Pingan; he certainly looked the part. 

Cui Dongshan glanced at the book in the boy’s hand, smiled, and nodded. Good, he could be considered half a disciple of his. 

There was a hint of potential there. 

Lin Junbi closed his book and smiled slightly at the three. 

Cui Dongshan smiled back; Pei Qian pretended not to see, while Cao Qinglang nodded in acknowledgment. 

Cao Qinglang had already recognized the boy’s identity. Their master had carved inscriptions and notes in the house, casually discussing two rounds of guarding battles without mentioning good or evil, merely explaining the thoughts and actions of both sides to his three students. 

The three moved on. 

Lin Junbi continued flipping through the “Cloud Color Spectrum.” 

Although he was reluctant to push through consecutively in his cultivation, resulting in a low realm, under the guidance of the sword immortal Ku Xia, he served as a half-transmitter of teachings for his companions here. He was also the only sword cultivator who had captured a fleeting essence of ancient sword intent, able to remain in a critical energy palace. Half of the innate sword embryos, including Yan Lü, Jiang Guanzheng, and Zhu Mei, had once grasped a fleeting sword intent, and Yan Lü had captured it more than once. Unfortunately, none had managed to retain it. Lin Junbi had not leaked any secrets, and the sword immortal Ku Xia was clear about this but did not reveal it. 

Lin Junbi planned to wait until he had gathered three strands of ancient sword immortal’s residual sword intent. If no one was successful, he would say he had received a gift, encouraging them so that they wouldn’t lose motivation in their sword practice. 

Whenever the three reached a deserted area, Cui Dongshan would quicken his pace, and Pei Qian kept up effortlessly, breathing smoothly and feeling incredibly relaxed. 

Cao Qinglang, however, was enduring hardship. 

Walking atop the Sword Qi Great Wall, following Cui Dongshan and Pei Qian’s swift pace was far more exhausting than the slow breathing practice at the Ning residence. 

Cui Dongshan would occasionally stop, allowing Cao Qinglang to sit and meditate for a couple of hours. 

Pei Qian, feeling bored, leaned on the city wall, resting her chin on her hand, gazing southward, hoping to catch sight of a great monster or two. Of course, just a glimpse would suffice; there was no need for greetings or introductions. Once she returned to the vast world and her hometown, the Abandoned Mountain, she would be able to chat with Warm Tree and Mi Li about those great monsters, who were supposedly standing right outside the city wall, just a stone’s throw away, staring at her. She wasn’t afraid in the slightest; she’d stretch her neck just to see the great monster’s head, and ultimately, wielding her walking staff, she would perform a set of mad sword techniques to scare it off. 

Unfortunately, after traveling for several days, she hadn’t been able to catch sight of any great monsters from the wild world. 

Leaning on the city wall, Pei Qian asked Cui Dongshan why the great monsters were so timid. 

Cui Dongshan chuckled. “It’s not that there are no great monsters; it’s just that some old sword immortals’ flying swords can reach places far beyond what your eyes can see.” 

Pei Qian turned her head and asked, “Is Master Uncle certainly one of them?” 

Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes and made a face, sitting cross-legged, swaying his body. 

Pei Qian whispered, “Did Master Uncle really hit you? I’ll have a word with Master Uncle later; don’t hold a grudge. If we can enter the same door, become one family, we shouldn’t be burning incense for good fortune.” 

Cui Dongshan didn’t like to worship Buddhas; even if he accompanied her to temples, he never clasped his hands together in reverence to the Buddhas, nor would he kneel and bow. 

Pei Qian thus quietly helped him pay a visit, secretly telling the Buddha not to hold it against him. 

In truth, the city wall already felt like heaven. 

The strong winds above blew Cui Dongshan’s white clothes, his hair fluttering. 

Unknowingly, he suddenly felt nostalgic for the travels of his youth. 

There were more people then, everyone carrying bamboo boxes. 

He remembered how he had intentionally recounted tales of renowned recluses from the books for Xiao Baoping and the others to hear. 

At that time, Li Huai hadn’t understood at all; he merely remembered. Such was the nature of children. They would at most think that the world was like this. 

Xie Xuan’s face was full of ridicule. This was the usual mindset of youth. They thought the world was like this. In reality, many people, despite their age, remained the same. 

However, Lin Shouyi had remarked that those true recluses were naturally unknown to the world and would never appear in books. Why should that diminish all “recluses”? 

As for the girl in the red cotton jacket, she was one who thought further, stating that to draw accurate conclusions, one must look at the number of known and unknown recluses. 

At that time, he wasn’t yet the boy in straw sandals who belonged to his master; he simply sat by the bonfire, silently listening, quietly remembering everyone’s opinions while occasionally tossing a dry branch into the fire. 

Cui Dongshan pressed his hands against his walking staff and smiled. “Eldest Senior Sister, did you keep that small wooden bead my master gifted you well?” 

Pei Qian rolled her eyes. “Less chatter, you’re annoying.” 

Then Pei Qian suddenly smiled, turning around, facing away from the south, carefully pulling out her money pouch, and from it, she retrieved a slightly irregular wooden bead. 

It was the reward her master had given her when she had made a significant contribution that day by helping him devise a new way to earn money. He told her to keep it safe, as he had treasured it for many years, and if she lost it, she would be in trouble. 

Her master’s earnest teachings were something to be listened to with care. 

Cui Dongshan asked, “Do you know the origin of this bead?” 

Pei Qian shook her head, opening her palm to reveal the bead, which bore many uneven carvings, suggesting that the craftsman was not very skilled, nor did he have good eyesight. 

But since it was a gift from her master, it was priceless and irreplaceable. 

Alas, if it weren’t for the poor craftsmanship, in her heart, in her small ancestral hall, that bead would have held a lofty status, alongside her walking staff and small bamboo box. 

Cui Dongshan said softly, “This little thing has been treasured by your master longer than the carving knife that Cao Qinglang has.” 

Pei Qian asked curiously, “Does this little bead have a grand story?” 

Cui Dongshan shook his head. “Not a grand story, just a small one.” 

Pei Qian said, “You can’t leave a story half-told, hurry up and finish!” 

Cui Dongshan gently brushed the green bamboo walking staff on his lap and said, “When your master was young, during a break from herb-gathering, he chopped a piece of wood. He carried it home in a basket and personally made a string of prayer beads for the Buddha. Then, during his last visit to the Immortal’s Tomb to worship the Buddha, he hung the beads on the statue’s hand. When he returned after a long time, the beads had been lost to the wind and rain, leaving him with only this one bead. He kept it in a small ceramic jar all these years, never wanting to take it out, fearing it might get lost again. That’s why your master wants you to keep it safe; you truly need to take care of it.” 

Pei Qian clenched the bead tightly, lowering her head. 

That vivid scene of the river of time, that little story, was something Cui Dongshan had deliberately hidden from her, not wanting her to see. 

Cui Dongshan continued, “When your master was young, did he ever ask the Buddha if he showed any signs of divinity? It seems he didn’t, right? Your master was only that young, had he read books? Recognized characters? Yet, in this life, has he ever complained about his own gains and losses? While he traveled thousands of miles, has he ever held any malice towards others? I’m not asking you to emulate your master’s way of being; there’s no need for that. Your master is your master, and Pei Qian is Pei Qian. I just want you to understand that there are still many unknown beauties in this world. No matter how wide you open your eyes, you may find that you’ll never see or know them in your lifetime. So, we can’t just see the ugly things.” 

Cui Dongshan smiled. “Commoners worship the Buddha and seek blessings. I ask you, then, when the Buddha holds prayer beads, who is he seeking for?” 

Cui Dongshan answered his own question. “Only for himself.” 

Cao Qinglang suddenly spoke, “In your master’s hometown, there’s a plaque in the grand scholar’s hall that reads ‘Do Not Seek Outside’.” 

Cui Dongshan nodded. “Many principles are fundamentally interlinked. Our Confucian teachings also involve a process of self-inquiry and introspection. However, there are problems with this. In the past, studying and reading had high thresholds. Those who could pursue knowledge often came from well-off families, not needing to deal with trivial matters of daily life. They didn’t have to struggle with the gains and losses of the lower classes. But over time, as more scholars emerged, the old teachings became insufficient. The principles of the sages only teach you to rise higher but don’t tell you how to earn a living or how to deal with bad people like fighting. The phrase ‘Be close to gentlemen and distance yourself from petty people’ is just six words—do we, the later generations, have enough of that? I see the principles are indeed good, but they just aren’t very practical.” 

“Almost every generation of scholars feels that the world they live in is too unsatisfactory, blaming heaven and earth, resenting others and themselves. Isn’t it likely that as we read more and age, we grow more aware of the world’s imperfections and understand suffering more deeply, leading to such pessimistic views? Hasn’t the world not really improved, but neither has it worsened? These possibilities are worth pondering, right? In fact, many sufferings go unspoken, and even if they’re written, they’re not written in great detail.” 

“Beautiful people and events, in comparison to many painful experiences, seem to have never been the enemy of the latter, and the latter has always fought with a few against many yet has always triumphed.” 

Pei Qian remained silent. 

Cao Qinglang ceased his practice, beginning to cultivate his heart. 

Cui Dongshan, unusually, showed a hint of fatigue in his expression. “It’s not that the principles are truly wrong; it’s just that because they’re too right and too good, they’re hard to implement. For those who can’t achieve them, many people don’t resent the unreasonable people and events around them but rather blame the principles and the sages. Why? The words in books don’t speak for themselves, and even if the sages heard it, they wouldn’t care. What to do then? That’s how many old sayings and countless ‘folk sayings’ emerge. For example, the saying ‘It’s better to offend a gentleman than a petty person.’ Is there any reasoning behind it? Upon deep reflection, one might feel something is off. Is there really nothing? How could there not be? Almost everyone in the world is a person who is genuinely trying to live. All of their fortunes and incense are accumulated from a single copper coin, so thinking about it this way, that saying is practically a piece of golden advice.” 

Cui Dongshan leaned back, “I’m most annoyed by those clever yet not truly wise people. Since they’ve already broken the rules and gained advantages, they should just shut up and enjoy the benefits they’ve earned. Yet, they insist on coming out and showing off their cleverness, and I just happen to encounter them… Pei Qian, Cao Qinglang, do you know how your little senior brother initially thought on the other extreme of his state of mind?” 

Pei Qian shook her head. 

Cao Qinglang said, “I dare not think.” 

Cui Dongshan laughed. “Then it would be to pull all the beings of the heavens and earth and sleep together.” 

Pei Qian, gripping the bead tightly in one hand, tugged at the big white goose’s sleeve, her expression fearful but her gaze earnest as she said, “You can’t do that!” 

Cao Qinglang comforted her, “Eldest Senior Sister, have you forgotten what the little senior brother said? ‘In the earliest times,’ many thoughts have passed, and to come back and correct them is to truly eliminate that ‘what if.’” 

“My heart finds great satisfaction in morality, regardless of how unworthy the world may seem.” 

Cui Dongshan self-deprecatingly said, “In this lifetime, I’ve seen too many hearts that are treacherous, hidden and obscure. Not to mention looking at them, just hiding from afar, the stench is overwhelming. And the problem is that I happen to enjoy looking and smelling, finding pleasure in it. However, my patience is not very good, so I’m not suited to be a true teacher. Don’t mention just the master; I’m even inferior to Autumn.” 

Looking back, it turned out that the old scholar had long been right. Those who are deeply learned and knowledgeable, perhaps have someone like Cui Yan, someone who can benefit the world, but those who can teach and nurture well, among them, there are only Xiao Qi and Mao Xiaodong. 

Cui Dongshan stood up. “Let’s go enjoy the scenery. There’s great beauty between heaven and earth. I must not fail to appreciate it for thousands of years.” 

Cao Qinglang understood the reason and immediately stood up. 

Pei Qian carefully secured the bead, reluctantly getting to her feet; she truly wished to return to her master and mistress’ home. 

At this moment, she was likely the only one kept in the dark. 

This is also why Autumn would “stroll” day and night at the Ning residence’s martial arts arena. 

On the city wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall, in a place extremely distant, a monk sat alone, hands clasped, silently reciting Buddhist chants. 

The only one who could be aware of this matter was likely the old sword immortal Chen Qingdu. 

As Pei Qian walked, stopping and going along the way, she spotted the sword cultivators from the Taihui Sword Sect practicing on the city wall, but Liu was present while Bai Shou was absent. 

Pei Qian felt a sense of relief. 

Taking advantage of the fact that there was no one nearby, she happily performed a set of mad sword techniques. 

Cao Qinglang kept a distance from her, afraid of being inadvertently injured. 

Cui Dongshan took several hits in the process. 

Later, Pei Qian and the others encountered a rather peculiar female sword immortal. 

She was swinging on a swing atop the city wall. 

Pei Qian thought it was quite the sight; the swing was entertaining, with only two ropes stretching high into the sky and a wooden plank for the female sword immortal to sit on. The swing had no frame but seemed to sway indefinitely. 

Cui Dongshan dashed over, laughing as he asked, “Sister, do you need my help pushing the swing?” 

The female sword immortal, named Zhou Cheng, appeared to be lost in her thoughts, seemingly oblivious to him. 

According to the tales from the northern city of the Sword Qi Great Wall, this female sword immortal had long lost her mind. During every battle, she never took the initiative to leave the city to fight; she merely staunchly defended her swing, not allowing any monstrous creatures to come within a hundred feet. If they approached, they would die. As for those from the Sword Qi Great Wall, whether they were sword immortals, sword cultivators, or playful children, as long as they didn’t disturb her, Zhou Cheng would pay them no mind. 

Cui Dongshan was not disheartened. “Sister Zhou, it’s Dongshan.” 

This sword immortal sister, fair and plump, was truly beautiful. 

Any further conversation would be a good thing. 

Zhou Cheng, swaying along with the swing, turned her head, not looking at the white-clad youth but at the slightly darker-skinned girl, smiling as she said, “Would you like to sit for a while?” 

Pei Qian shook her head, timidly saying, “Sister Zhou, let’s skip it; I won’t disturb you.” 

Zhou Cheng smiled. “I can take you as my disciple on behalf of my master. If you already have a master, it’s fine; it’s just a nominal title. I’ll teach you a sword technique that’s not inferior to your own; both of our paths come from the same source. It’s just that my talent isn’t enough to reach the pinnacle, while you have great hope.” 

Even Cui Dongshan was taken aback. 

Of course, it was all an act. 

This sword immortal sister was quite generous. 

She didn’t let him down, as expected. 

However, Pei Qian was nearly frightened to tears. 

Could this senior sword immortal be so powerful that she could hear the jokes Pei Qian made while crossing the river from the other side of the mountain? She had only been boasting with the big white goose. 

Zhou Cheng suddenly covered her mouth and laughed. “It’s okay, don’t be afraid. Come visit often.” 

Pei Qian also smiled, though it looked more pitiful than crying. 

Zhou Cheng thought for a moment, then reached out to tug one of the long ropes, her wrist twisting, producing a ball of golden thread, which she gently tossed to the girl with whom she had a good rapport. “After receiving it, don’t return it to me, and don’t throw it away. If you don’t want to learn, just leave it; it doesn’t matter.” 

The actions of sword immortals in the Sword Qi Great Wall were indeed baffling. 

Cui Dongshan looked at Pei Qian, who was flustered and appeared to be crying, and laughed. “Don’t you thank Sister Zhou?” 

Pei Qian didn’t dare to clasp her fists in salute; she could only bow her head in gratitude. 

After departing from that peculiar swing and the female sword immortal, Pei Qian finally dared to wipe the sweat from her forehead and asked, “Is everything really okay?” 

Cui Dongshan laughed. “If Master asks, just say you picked it up from the ground. If he doesn’t believe you, I’ll convince him.” 

Pei Qian was skeptical. 

Cao Qinglang held back a laugh. 

That night, Pei Qian suddenly looked up, and Cao Qinglang followed her gaze, catching a glimpse of a colorful sea of clouds formed by the blooming sunset high on the city wall. 

It was said that a sword immortal slept soundly there year-round, as if lying on a magnificent satin bed. 

Cui Dongshan took a glance and no longer looked, finding it flashy. This sword immortal, named Mi Yu, was merely a jade purity realm cultivator built upon the wealth of the divine, thanks to his good elder brother, the fierce sword immortal Mi Hu. If not for Mi Hu sacrificing many of his own opportunities and foundation to nurture this brother, he would have already reached the immortal realm. However, the losses and gains of such choices were ultimately meaningless to outsiders, as they were merely Mi Hu’s decisions. Mi Hu had a penchant for slaying enemies, fighting fiercely each time. It was said that during his most unfortunate battle, his physical and spiritual bodies nearly reached the point of “mountains and rivers splitting.” Yet, he not only did not fall in rank but remained firmly established in his realm, still having hope to break through his bottleneck and reach a higher level. 

As for this sword immortal Mi Yu, the most cultured and refined among the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, he was quite popular among the ladies. Moreover, many women from other towns had entangled relationships with him. 

Cui Dongshan had no intention of lingering; his purpose for this journey was another unreserved great sword immortal, Yue Qing. 

With a life-bound flying sword named “Hundred Zhang Spring” and a second one named “Lark in the Sky,” he was formidable in both duels and battlefield assaults. 

Of course, Cui Dongshan could not currently match this renowned “contender among ten.” Yet, he had his master, and his master had the eldest senior brother. 

Cui Dongshan rarely caused trouble for others; trouble usually came to him. 

This made Cui Dongshan feel extraordinarily pleased. 

The sword immortal Mi Yu, who was resting on the clouds, sat up and brushed aside the wondrous mist resembling brocade, smiling as he said, “You are Chen Pingan’s disciples, aren’t you?” 

Cui Dongshan raised a hand to shield Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang, scratching his head. “What can we do for you?” 

Mi Yu laughed. “No need for guidance; I’m not your teacher. I’m merely pleased to see so many of you emerging from the dwindling lineage of the Confucian Sage. Chen Pingan is quite capable, truly worthy of being the disciple of the old sage. It’s a joyous occasion, and it’s no wonder he can thrive in the Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

Cui Dongshan muttered, “If you keep speaking in such an ambiguous manner, I might respond in kind.” 

Mi Yu seemed to hear a tremendous joke and laughed heartily, his sleeves shaking, instantly filling the area with vibrant clouds. “Just speak your mind; I’m not so serious as to argue with you little ones.” 

Cui Dongshan timidly asked, “So, is Yue Qing your estranged father?” 

Mi Yu leaned slightly forward, smiling as he asked, “What do you mean by that?” 

The white-clad youth complained, “When speaking ambiguously, do you even need a reason? If you had said so earlier, I wouldn’t have mentioned it.” 

Pei Qian was sweating profusely, ready to shout for her master uncle at any moment; whether he could hear her was irrelevant; scaring him was always a possibility. 

Cao Qinglang, however, laughed in agreement, “The little senior brother has a point.” 

It was the first time Pei Qian felt that the wooden-headed Cao had some merit. 

She had never thought of him as brave before; she had always believed him to be even more timid than Mi Li. 

Mi Yu extended a finger, gently tapping the air as if contemplating how to “argue.” 

The white-clad youth said, “Alright, alright, I was wrong. Yue Qing is not your estranged father. I sincerely admit my mistake; you, senior, have an unmatched sword technique. It’s something you’ve claimed yourself, so you wouldn’t hold a grudge against me, would you?” 

Mi Yu smiled without responding. 

He, Mi Yu, along with his brother Mi Hu and the formidable sword immortal Yue Qing—was that not enough? Mi Yu felt it was nearly sufficient. Moreover, his brother had Yue Qing, and he had many friends. 

As for Chen Pingan, what were these younger generation brats who had lower status than him worth? 

Mi Yu stood up, planning to find a suitable excuse to teach these little ants beneath his feet a lesson. The words of a sword immortal, whether pleasant or not, should be heeded, so they should obediently keep their mouths shut. 

Pei Qian took a step forward, focusing her voice to speak to Cui Dongshan. “Big White Goose, you should quickly find Master Uncle! Cao Qinglang and I are of a low realm; he won’t kill us!” 

She then quietly urged Cao Qinglang, “No matter what happens, don’t intervene, and don’t say anything! Don’t give him a chance to attack you!” 

Cui Dongshan scratched his head. 

Eldest Senior Sister. 

Do you really not know what kind of person your master uncle is? 

This guy had fought fiercely with both him and Qi Jingchun back in the day; they were family, so how would he be gentle with others? 

In an instant, thunder roared atop the Sword Qi Great Wall, racing toward this location. 

Mi Yu squinted, his spirit shaking, summoning his flying sword, but he dared not take a stance to kill; he merely defended himself. 

The sword qi arrived in an instant, casually shattering the sword formation of sword immortal Mi Yu. A figure stood atop the dissipated clouds, with a long sword still sheathed at his waist. 

Mi Yu remained motionless, afraid to act. 

At this moment, the jade purity realm Mi Yu finally realized that watching this person delve deep into the heartland, challenging two great monsters alone, was a world apart from personally facing him. 

The person who had fully retracted all of his sword qi stood beside Mi Yu, but he did not even look at Mi Yu, merely gazing forward, calmly saying, “The Confucian lineage is too heavy with principles; that broken sword of yours cannot withstand it. Do you think you, such a useless being, are worthy?” 

Cao Qinglang bowed and saluted, “Cao Qinglang from the Abandoned Mountain, greeting Master Uncle.” 

Pei Qian hurriedly followed suit, bowing and saying, “Pei Qian from the Abandoned Mountain, respectfully welcoming the greatest Master Uncle!” 

After getting up, Pei Qian felt a lingering sense of satisfaction, so she clenched her fists, stood on her toes, and stretched her neck up to wave vigorously at the figure above, saying, “Master Uncle, be careful! This guy has a dark heart!” 

Turning her head, she suddenly saw two junior disciples appear. Although she felt a little awkward in her heart, as soon as Cui Dongshan finally recognized the situation and rolled a bit further away, she nodded to the green-clad youth and the little girl, as if indicating that Master Uncle was aware. 

Looking to the left and right, he said, “Mi Yu, are you calling for Yue Qing and Mi Hu to come out, or should I help you call them?” 

Mi Yu’s face turned pale. 

He found himself trapped in a small world, and even the slightest movement would invite pure sword intent, as if countless sword tips were pointing at him. 

Cui Dongshan covered his mouth with both hands, lowering his voice and speaking slowly, “Master Uncle, you must win!” 

Then he hid behind Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang. 

Worrying that this Master Uncle might give him another sword strike. 

As for the matter of slaying monsters, he had never truly focused his heart on it. 

Except for a few rare existences, even the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall were still unaware of this, which was why they realized it now. 

Cui Dongshan revealed a kind smile; sure enough, those who had some knowledge of sword techniques would find it relieving to not attack their own but target others. 

Pei Qian tucked her walking staff under her arm, placing her hands in front of her, lightly clapping. 

Cui Dongshan smiled brightly. “After today, if the Confucian lineage continues to act unreasonable, word will spread throughout the Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

Pei Qian asked, “Why?” 

Cao Qinglang sneered, “Others would think many principles are only in the hands of the weak after the strong become weak, as they have no shared experiences.” 

Cui Dongshan laughed, “Don’t learn from this.” 

Cao Qinglang shook his head. “I just know these things; I only learn from the master.” 

The left and right had no intention of paying attention to Cui Dongshan. After retracting his gaze, he looked into the distance, his expression indifferent as he continued speaking, “Mi Hu, Yue Qing. Come out and fight with me. Just determine the winner and loser; if you’re willing to forfeit your life, then go die.” 

The sword immortal Mi Hu communicated with his mind, saying, “I concede and apologize.” 

Yue Qing remained silent, not offering any response. 

So the left and right vanished, heading to find Yue Qing. 

Did Yue Qing only realize to keep silent now? 

Prior to this, was it not I, the left and right, who pried open your mouth to speak those nonsensical things? 

Cui Dongshan summoned a talisman boat, smiling as he said, “What are you looking at? There’s nothing to see; let’s go home. Your Master Uncle’s fights are the least refined, the most disgraceful.” 

Cui Dongshan and Pei Qian sat on either side of the boat, each holding their walking staffs as if they were paddling, with Cui Dongshan earnestly assuring the eldest senior sister that this way, their return journey could be faster. 

Cao Qinglang felt somewhat helpless as he watched Pei Qian, who was vigorously paddling and laughing heartily. He didn’t know whether she truly believed it or just found it amusing. 

At this moment, Cui Dongshan felt particularly refreshed, simply lying on the boat, his butt in the air, as if holding the staff with both hands, energetically paddling. 

After previously taking that sword strike, aside from discussing serious matters, he had also told Master Uncle about the great achievements of the sword immortal Yue Qing. This transaction, indeed, was not a loss. 

Late into the night, they returned to the Ning residence. 

Pei Qian didn’t manage to see her master’s wife, feeling somewhat disappointed. 

Chen Pingan and Cui Dongshan went to the Dragon Slaying Cliff pavilion to discuss matters. 

Cao Qinglang returned to his own place to cultivate. 

The news of the battle between the two great sword immortals spread rapidly throughout the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

It was said that the great sword immortal Yue Qing was forcefully knocked off the city wall by the left and right, falling toward the south. 

This left no room for Yue Qing's intention to part with life and death. 

In the end, it was said that several sword immortals intervened to persuade him. 

That night, the southern sword light was as brilliant as the sun rising, illuminating the city for quite a while. 

Eventually, there was no matter of life and death. 

The Sword Qi Great Wall had seen many grand scenes, and now there were merely more drinkers. 

The business over at the stacked-roof shop was particularly thriving. 

Recently, Nalan Yexing suddenly felt that Bai Lianshuang, his wife’s aunt, had been looking at him with a rather penetrating gaze. 

Counting the times, he realized she had called him “Nalan Old Dog” significantly fewer times recently, and her imposing demeanor had diminished considerably. 

This left Nalan Yexing feeling somewhat creeped out. 

Then he saw the radiant smile of the white-clad youth who called him “Nalan Grandpa.” As they walked side by side, Nalan Yexing asked, “Dongshan, have you said something to Bai Aunt recently?” 

Cui Dongshan nodded. “Of course, Bai Aunt is an elder in the Ning residence; as a junior, I certainly must greet her.” 

Nalan Yexing laughed. “Aside from greeting her, did you say anything else?” 

Cui Dongshan stomped his foot in annoyance. “I should have said something, but I forgot. I’m not someone who holds grudges, nor do I keep track of things; it’s truly bad.” 

Nalan Yexing stopped in his tracks, watching the lively and carefree white-clad youth, reminiscing about the time when the two had called each other brothers. 

That morning, Pei Qian summoned Cui Dongshan to escort her, and she boldly walked along the secluded street outside the Guo residence’s high wall, carrying her walking staff and a small bamboo box. 

It was too bold and impolite; they didn’t even come out to welcome her arrival, and it could not be said that she was half a disciple of her master. That simply couldn’t be counted. 

Forget it; since it was so, it meant that she and her eldest senior sister had no fate together. In the future, the Abandoned Mountain would no longer have a place for her; she couldn’t blame her eldest senior sister for not giving her a chance. If given and not grasped, it would be pitiful. 

To her surprise, a head popped up over the wall, arms resting on top, and legs dangling in the air. She asked, “Hey, who’s that little one on the road? Your walking staff and bamboo box look nice, but they make you look a bit dark.” 

Pei Qian stood still, turning to look. 

Guo Zhujiu widened her eyes, looking at Pei Qian, tentatively asking, “You wouldn’t be the beautiful and stunning, invincible in martial arts, eight-foot-tall eldest senior sister in my heart, would you?” 

Pei Qian averted her gaze, looking pitifully at the big white goose. 

The big white goose showed no loyalty and pretended to be deaf and mute. 

Thus, when they arrived at the Ning residence, Pei Qian lay on her master’s table, feeling somewhat listless. 

Chen Pingan put down the seal he was carving and smiled, “What’s the matter? Have you met that girl, Lu Duan? Not feeling too happy?” 

Pei Qian replied with a “hum,” saying, “Master, I’m not reporting her to you behind her back; I just don’t particularly like her.” 

Chen Pingan laughed, “In our Abandoned Mountain ancestral hall, there are no rules stating that we must like each other very much; as long as we each uphold our rules, that’s sufficient.” 

Pei Qian immediately sat up, nodding, “That’ll do! Otherwise, pretending to like her would be too difficult!” 

Chen Pingan nodded. “There’s no need to force it, but remember not to look at others with prejudice. Whether you become friends or not depends on fate.” 

Pei Qian beamed with joy. 

No matter how Guo Zhujiu turned into a disciple of the Abandoned Mountain, wouldn’t she still have to call her eldest senior sister? 

Chen Pingan hesitated for a moment, sitting up straight. “Next, Master needs to tell you something involving right and wrong. Even if Master asks you, you don’t have to say anything, but if after being sad, you think of something, you can come and talk to me. It’s all fine. At the same time, remember, since I’m willing to speak some serious words with you, it means I believe you can handle it. I acknowledge Pei Qian, my grand disciple. Moreover, I’m not ignorant of who Pei Qian was in the past, but I still chose to take you as my disciple. It’s certainly not just because I see your good side, your improvements, right?” 

Pei Qian’s face turned pale, sitting up straight as well, fists clenched, but her gaze was resolute as she lightly nodded. 

Chen Pingan then continued, “Today, when I speak of past events, it’s not to dig up old accounts, but it can be considered so, because I have always felt that right and wrong are ever-present, and that is one of the most fundamental principles in my heart. I don’t want you to think that today’s goodness can cover yesterday’s mistakes. At the same time, I sincerely believe that the goodness you have today is hard-earned, and I will not deny any good you’ve done in the past or in the future, big or small. I cherish it all and care about it deeply.” 

Pei Qian’s eyes turned red as she raised her hand to wipe away tears but immediately set it down again. “Master, please go on; Pei Qian is listening.” 

Chen Pingan’s expression was resolute. He didn’t deliberately lower his voice but tried to remain calm, slowly speaking to Pei Qian. “I privately asked Cao Qinglang if, back in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he had ever sought you out to fight. Cao Qinglang said he had. I asked him if Pei Qian had ever mentioned to him, in front of him, what she had seen in the hands of Ding Ying’s companions on the street. Do you know what Cao Qinglang said?” 

Pei Qian furrowed her brow, her lips trembling, suddenly bursting into tears. “I did, Master, I did. I said it, and then that day, Cao Qinglang was so heartbroken he went mad and sought me out for a fight. I even hit him with a bench.” 

Chen Pingan sat there and said, “Pei Qian, think for yourself about what should be done and do it. But Master will tell you, in our lives, not just you, but even I, not every mistake can be known and still have the opportunity for amends. Many mistakes, once we’ve made them, we want to correct them, yet there’s often no chance, none at all. Besides that, I also hope you understand that Cao Qinglang isn’t someone who holds grudges. It’s not that he thinks it’s a trivial matter; he simply chooses to forgive you. But the forgiveness of others and the mistakes we’ve made are two different matters. The world is complicated like that. We may do good and act kindly, but many mistakes still exist, always present, even if no one remembers them, we will still remember them. It’s not that you have countless reasons; indeed, you may have myriad reasons to make a mistake, but a mistake remains a mistake.” 

Pei Qian sat there, crying her heart out. 

Chen Pingan stood up and sat next to her on the bench. “Your master has made you sad today. If you make another mistake in the future, it will be the same. What will you do then?” 

Pei Qian, trembling, reached out a hand, cautiously tugging at her master’s sleeve, sobbing, “Does Master not want me anymore?” 

Chen Pingan shook his head. “Of course not! It’s hard-earned to transform yesterday’s Pei Qian into today’s Pei Qian; I wouldn’t want to let go of that.” 

Turning around, he gently rubbed Pei Qian’s head, his voice hoarse as he laughed, “Because sometimes, Master’s own life can be quite hard too.” 

Pei Qian began to cry even more violently. 

She remembered her parents during the escape, the little beggar in the capital of Nanyuan Country, lying beside a stone lion counting stars under the scorching summer sun, and suddenly thought of Grandpa Cui, who never greeted her when he left. It all came flooding back. 

Everything she didn’t want to remember, everything she wanted to remember but dared not think of, surged into her heart all at once. 

In the quiet little world that formed in the corridor outside, 

Cao Qinglang had gone from standing to sitting against the wall. 

The little senior brother Cui Dongshan sat beside him. 

And this little senior brother maintained that little world, quietly leading Cao Qinglang away from the residence. 

Cao Qinglang said, “I feel much better now; thank you, little senior brother.” 

Cui Dongshan said, “Meeting our master is not something to take for granted; let’s encourage each other.” 

Cao Qinglang stepped back, bowing deeply without rising. 

Cui Dongshan suddenly exclaimed, “No, no, once we get here, either we’ll have Master Uncle knock someone off the city wall, or we’ll let Nalan Grandpa bully us; I need to show a bit of the little senior brother’s demeanor and go find someone to play chess with! Just wait; you’ll soon hear of the glorious deeds of the little senior brother! Winning is no challenge; winning three or five games is nothing. It’s only when I win someone who wants to keep losing that it’ll show that your little senior brother’s chess skills are quite something.” 

A wisp of white clouds drifted toward the city wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

He was off to find Lin Junbi, the young master. 

As he walked, Cui Dongshan had already thought of his opening line. 

“Lin, what a coincidence! You’re reading the ‘Cloud Color Spectrum’ again. To be honest, I can play chess too. Your skills are so high; how about giving me three pieces? That’s not too much to ask, right? Who am I? I’m Dongshan!” 

His sleeves fluttered like white clouds. 

Cui Dongshan faced the sky, his arms and legs flailing as he played freely. 

One area nurtures one kind of person, and the Shao Yuan Dynasty is indeed a good place. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 715: Bad Chess Moves Lead to a Wounded Heart, Spicy Drinks Upset the Stomach (Part One)

The tavern was bustling today, filled with a crowd of gamblers and drunkards, all jovial and lively. They were busy praising the second shopkeeper, not only for his handsome demeanor reminiscent of a jade tree standing tall, but also for the delectable combination of the Bamboo Sea Cave's wine paired with pickled vegetables and Yangchun noodles. It was said that this was a unique offering of our Sword Qi Great Wall—only true sword immortals would dare to drink here.

This caused some people to feel uneasy. As they sipped their drinks, they felt a strange discomfort wash over them. Could this be a vile tactic from some opposing force? Was this what the second shopkeeper referred to as the clumsy art of flattery? Thus, these individuals quietly noted the names and appearances of those who were most boisterous and obnoxious in their praises, planning to report back to the second shopkeeper later. As for whether they might wrong innocent folk or harm allies, that was the second shopkeeper's responsibility. They were only tasked with relaying information and stirring the pot. After all, a few among them had only recently received a hint from the second shopkeeper and had yet to truly become companions in gambling and scheming for profit.

On the city wall, Yu Jianfu was munching on a flatbread while holding a water jug, gazing out towards a battlefield to the south. He noticed many new craters dotting the landscape. From such a high vantage point, he could see the pits and hollows below, and he could only imagine that for those standing amidst them, the craters would appear as large as lakes while the people would seem as small as mustard seeds.

Yu Jianfu often came to the city wall these days, and he was considered a half-friend of the young girl, Zhu Mei. After all, within the ranks of sword cultivators in the Shao Yuan Dynasty, the most appealing figure was still the clear-cut Zhu Mei, followed closely by the Golden Core sword cultivator, Jin Zhenmeng. As for the rest, he found them less than likable. Yu Jianfu's disapproval manifested in a single way: he simply avoided them. If someone greeted him, he would nod politely, but if they attempted to continue with pleasantries, he would brush them off. If he encountered a senior, he would acknowledge them respectfully but keep it brief. It was as simple as that.

Yu Jianfu was here to hone his martial arts, not to expand family connections. Furthermore, the Yu family had only a minor affiliation with the Upside-Down Mountain and was otherwise disconnected from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As for Zhu Mei, she likely thought of Yu Jianfu as a long-lost sister, separated by different parents.

Yu Jianfu felt a bit anxious; he had brought too little flatbread and had eaten too quickly. The few remaining pieces were dwindling fast. 

Yet, this small concern was trivial. His purpose in coming to the Sword Qi Great Wall was to pursue Cao Ci's martial path and solidify his Golden Body stage. He hadn’t expected to encounter the second shopkeeper, who was also at the Golden Body stage. Even more surprisingly, compared to what he had imagined the Sword Qi Great Wall to be, the sword immortals here were far more captivating. Even though Yu Jianfu wasn't a Qi practitioner or a sword cultivator, he still felt that the Sword Qi Great Wall had its unique merits that couldn’t be dismissed.

After finishing his flatbread and taking a sip of water, Yu Jianfu planned to rest for a moment before getting up to practice his punches.

Practicing martial arts was of utmost importance; it was destined to be the priority of his life. But occasionally slacking off and thinking about matters unrelated to his martial arts wasn’t too serious.

The swordsmanship of the senior nearby was truly remarkable.

Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan had witnessed the start and end of that battle. According to him, the technique used by the left-hand senior was “unreasonable strength,” as he forcefully cleaved Yue Qing off the city wall. After that, he no longer restrained his sword energy. Throughout the encounter, Yue Qing had barely managed to counterattack, the number of times could be counted on one hand. It wasn’t that Yue Qing wasn’t strong; it was just that his flying sword, the Hundred Zhang Spring, and its waterfall-like sword energy couldn’t compare to the lake-like might of the left-hand sword energy. The other flying sword, the Skylark in the Sky, hardly even had a chance to touch the ground.

However, Sun Juyuan also laughed and mentioned that Yue Qing had held back, not out of politeness, but out of fear—fear of truly being killed by a single sword strike from the left-hand senior.

At the same time, it also provided a pretext and reason for other sword immortals to intervene. Unfortunately, the left-hand senior ignored the good advice of the two sword immortals and merely focused on bombarding Yue Qing with chaotic sword energy. This wasn't truly chaotic or random; on the contrary, it was simply that the left-hand senior’s sword energy was overwhelming, and the weight of his intent was heavy. In a battleground where sword immortals determined life and death, fleeting moments made it hard to see everything clearly. It didn't matter; all one sought was to dodge, defend, and break through. Many sword strikes from perilous moments were often executed with spontaneity and intuition, allowing for a successful hit.

At that time, the left-hand senior said nothing, but his meaning was clear: aside from Yue Qing, all other sword immortals were enemies if they got too close.

The two sword immortals were nearly embarrassed to death at that moment. One of them was nearly cleaved in half by a sword drawn from the left-hand senior, causing the ground to crack and a chasm to form. If the left-hand senior hadn’t intentionally diverted his strike by ten zhang, that sword immortal would have had to muster all his strength to withstand it. He could only call for reinforcements, but no one dared to attack recklessly. What if the left-hand senior abandoned Yue Qing and turned his attention to a different target?

Just as Yue Qing was forced to put forth all his strength to counterattack, the figure of the elder sword immortal appeared atop the city wall, hands clasped behind his back, gazing towards the battlefield in the south, as if exchanging a few words with the left-hand senior.

Only then did the left-hand senior sheathe his sword.

Sun Juyuan ultimately sighed to Yu Jianfu, “With such superb swordsmanship, he isn’t afraid of a single opponent facing a group. Is the left-hand senior aiming for instant fame at the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Yu Jianfu, curious, inquired, “What do you mean by instant fame?”

Unfortunately, Sun Juyuan laughed and did not elaborate further.

Yu Jianfu stood up, slowly extending his punches along the wall. His punches were slow, yet his movements were swift.

After walking for about a stick of incense, he encountered a young man in white approaching him. Yu Jianfu had no intention of knowing this person’s name, but she would first have to ask the chattering Zhu Mei for permission. Zhu Mei informed her that this young man was a student of Chen Ping’an, hailing from Treasure Bottle Continent, with the surname Cui and the given name Dongshan. By seniority, he was a third-generation disciple of the Confucian Sage lineage. However, it seemed that Cui Dongshan’s mind wasn’t quite right, fluctuating between brilliance and dullness, which was a pity given his handsome appearance.

The young man walked straight ahead, so Yu Jianfu slightly moved aside to allow them to pass by each other. 

Unexpectedly, the young man seemed to have the same intention, aligning his path perfectly. Yu Jianfu shifted again, and he too adjusted his step. After a few exchanges, Cui Dongshan halted and, with a woeful expression, said, “Sister Yu, just tell me whether you want to go left or right. I dare not move either way, or else you might think I have ulterior motives seeing a beautiful girl like you.”

Yu Jianfu remained silent, and upon seeing him stop, she chose to take a detour and pass by at a distance. However, the young man turned to follow her, walking alongside her but maintaining a distance of five or six steps. Cui Dongshan spoke softly, “Sister Yu, have you heard of the Hundred Sword Immortal Seal and the Bi Sword Immortal Seal? Is there something you have your eye on? Among my family’s teachers, I’m the most unworthy and financially strained one. Cultivation costs a lot of money, and I don’t want to burden my teacher, so I can only earn some money myself. I’ve managed to sneak a few seal books and folding fans from my teacher, and I bought a few stamps at a low price from the Young Master of the Yan family’s silk shop. Sister Yu, just treat me like a burden. I have two seal books, three folding fans, six silk fans, and six stamps. Sister Yu, would you like to take a look?”

Yu Jianfu stopped and smiled, “If I’m not mistaken, that boat you’re using is a rare treasure produced in the flowing clouds continent. Selling those seal books and folding fans, even if your business thrives for a hundred years, would it be enough to buy that boat? I doubt it. Just say, what exactly do you want from me?” 

The young man appeared sorrowful and helpless, with a bitter expression as he stared blankly, “In my eyes, Sister Yu was once the most unique noblewoman in the world. But now, it seems you still look down on those who work hard for small gains. Well, it makes sense; in a family of wealth and prestige, even a seemingly unremarkable stationery item, even a broken bird feeder, must cost a fortune.”

Yu Jianfu shook her head, “You still don’t want to speak plainly? Either use your hidden strength to make me stop, or don’t expect me to say another word to you.” 

Yu Jianfu was just about to move forward when Cui Dongshan quickly said, “I’m wholeheartedly trying to make money while hoping to leave an impression on Sister Yu. If you don’t believe me, it’s my own fault. I wouldn’t dare to be angry with you, Sister Yu. Since that’s the case, how about a bet? I bet that among my items, there’s definitely something you not only find appealing but would also be willing to pay for. If I lose, I’ll leave immediately and never see you again in this life. That would be the ultimate loss. But if I win, you’ll spend money to buy it. If I win, it’s just a matter of a grain of rice in size, how about that?”

Yu Jianfu smiled.

The young man seemed to have guessed her thoughts and laughed, “Sister Yu knows what kind of person I am. The reason I’m willing to gamble and accept defeat is not because the world thinks the Yu family is noble and I’m so generous, but because Sister Yu has always believed that even if she loses, she can win it back. Since I can win tomorrow, why should I admit defeat today? There’s no need.”

Yu Jianfu’s expression turned dark, “Who are you?!”

The young man replied aggrievedly, “I’m Dongshan, as I’ve told you before.”

Yu Jianfu curled her lip, “I’m not only willing to gamble and accept defeat; I’m also brave enough to bet. Show me your items.” 

Cui Dongshan’s face flushed with embarrassment. He glanced down at his waist, hurriedly pressing down his belt, then turned to the side, fidgeting and too shy to face her.

Yu Jianfu swiftly sent a punch towards his temple.

However, he stood there frozen, as if stunned, or perhaps completely unaware. Yu Jianfu immediately restrained her punch, which she had intended to unleash with the strength of a six-realm martial artist, compressing it down to a five-realm punch. Ultimately, her punch landed gently on the young man’s cheek, but Yu Jianfu was still greatly surprised by what unfolded next.

Originally, she couldn’t gauge his strength, but she had a rough estimate in her heart, predicting it to be between the highest Nascent Soul stage and the lowest Cave Dwelling stage. Otherwise, as a resident of the Sword Qi Great Wall, this young man’s movements and breathing wouldn’t appear so easy and smooth. Even if he were at the Cave Dwelling stage, he would at least be at mid-five realms. Thus, her punch from the five-realm martial artist, he could either dodge or withstand; he certainly wouldn’t be severely injured. Of course, a bit of flesh wound would still occur.

But Yu Jianfu never expected that after taking her punch, he would spin around multiple times and crash to the ground several steps away, limbs twitching.

Could her punch from the four-realm martial artist have killed him?

Yu Jianfu leaped forward, crouching beside the white-clad youth, who was indeed bleeding from his nose, and it wasn’t faked. The young man quickly hugged her leg, “Sister Yu, I thought I might never see you again.”

Yu Jianfu frowned, and with a surge of her punch intent, she pushed him away, causing him to slide several steps across the ground.

Cui Dongshan sat up, wiped his nose, and was about to carelessly wipe it on his sleeve. However, fearing he might dirty his clothes, he wiped it on the ground of the city wall instead.

Yu Jianfu’s frown deepened.

Zhu Mei wasn’t wrong; this person really was out of his mind.

Just as Yu Jianfu was about to leave, not wishing to get entangled with someone like him, Cui Dongshan had already quickly pulled out two seal books from his sleeve, laying them neatly on the ground in front of him. However, the two books weren’t laid flat but stood upright, obscuring all the stamps and folding fans behind them. Cui Dongshan smiled broadly and waved, “Sister Yu, let’s have a bet!”

Yu Jianfu hesitated for a moment, then strode towards the “small gambling table.”

Perhaps worried that she might catch a glimpse of the scene behind the “two big doors” of the seal books, knowing she would definitely lose, Cui Dongshan quickly raised his hands, covering the stamps and fans with his large, white sleeves, as if he was erecting a roof to shield her from the wind and rain.

Sitting cross-legged, Yu Jianfu pushed aside the two seal books, clearly not planning to buy them. 

However, just before Yu Jianfu could act, Cui Dongshan extended his hands once more, concealing two stamps.

All the folding fans were moved aside by Yu Jianfu’s hand. She picked up the stamp that Cui Dongshan hadn’t hidden, glanced at the inscription, and smiled. It was the “Fish Transforms into a Dragon.” Fish, as a homonym, means “Yu” (鬱).

It was an auspicious omen, but Yu Jianfu still didn’t feel particularly moved; she had never liked the name Yu Jianfu. While she was grateful for the surname Yu, she wasn’t overly infatuated with it. As for the notion of transforming fish into a dragon, she wasn’t a Qi practitioner. Even having witnessed the grandeur of the Dragon Gate in the Central Plains, she felt little emotion; scenery was merely scenery.

Thus, Yu Jianfu simply set it aside and said, “Only two stamps left.”

Cui Dongshan pressed his palms down on the stamps, as if shielding a mountain with five fingers. “Sister Yu, dare to bet a bit larger? The previous small bet still stands. How about we bet whether you prefer the left stamp or the right stamp? Or you could simply bet that you don’t like either, even if you're tempted, you wouldn’t spend money on them. Sister Yu, once a strong woman who asked my teacher about martial arts, I wonder if today’s boldness remains?”

Yu Jianfu asked, “What are the stakes for each bet?”

Cui Dongshan smiled and replied, “A bit larger than the initial bet, just betting that you’ll send a message to the Yu family for me. If it’s larger, it’s helping me send a message to Zhou Shenzhi, still just a single message—rest assured, Sister Yu, you’re only the messenger. You won’t have to do anything extra. If not, the bet is void, or I can simply consider myself losing.”

Yu Jianfu’s expression grew serious, and she spoke with a martial artist’s resolve, “Can I choose not to bet?”

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Of course you can. Who would force someone onto the gambling table? Where in the world would you find someone trying to make others buy their items? It’s just that since Sister Yu’s mindset has changed from before, I don’t trust you as much anymore. After all, you are from the Yu family, and Zhou Shenzhi is a respected elder you admire and a life-saving benefactor. Thus, saying things that go against your heart to not go against a larger truth is quite understandable. However, a gambling table is still a gambling table. I’m here to make money, and for fairness, I need Sister Yu to be willing to gamble and accept defeat, to pay for all the items.”

Yu Jianfu let out a sigh of relief.

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Willing to gamble and accept defeat means that Yu Jianfu believes she can win. Unfortunately, this time, admitting defeat today might not let you win back later. But of course, it’s a small matter. In life, how can one be so selfish and ignore the larger rules and customs of the world? Martial arts are noble, and when they are not high enough, they change accordingly.”

Yu Jianfu raised her head, “Are you intentionally using Chen Ping’an’s words to provoke me?”

At the entrance of the Ning residence, Yu Jianfu had once asked about martial arts, and Chen Ping’an mentioned that martial artists must have great intent behind their words.

Cui Dongshan smiled with his eyes squinting, “So what? What if I back down today? I can take a few more steps tomorrow. Yu Jianfu isn’t a Qi practitioner but a pure martial artist. The path of martial arts has always been like sailing against the current; one doesn’t fight for immediate gains.”

Yu Jianfu questioned, “Do you already know that if I lose and help you convey a message to the family, I, Yu Jianfu, will have to integrate into the Yu family with no confidence to roam the world anymore?”

Cui Dongshan nodded, smiling, “Naturally. If one doesn’t understand the nature of gamblers, how dare they set up a stall and welcome guests from all directions? It’s just that Yu Jianfu doesn’t appreciate the name bestowed by her ancestors. As a woman, being treated like a man, which proud woman would enjoy that? I believe Yu Jianfu has a decent view of her own surname.”

Yu Jianfu could only smile wryly.

Zhu Mei, you foolish girl. Regardless of the outcome, I’ll have to scold you a few times later.

Yet, amidst her complex emotions, Yu Jianfu had been closely observing the subtle movements of Cui Dongshan’s hands, hoping to discern which stamp he was more confident about.

However, the more she looked, the more uncertain she became.

Yu Jianfu pulled out a small coin and flicked it gently. When it landed, it showed the reverse side. “Right hand! I bet on the right hand concealing the stamp, I won’t pay for it.”

Cui Dongshan bent down to pick up the small coin.

Yu Jianfu shouted, “Cui Dongshan!”

Cui Dongshan raised his head, looking confused, “If I win, I won’t take the money. Why would I set up a stall and act as a burden? My family’s teacher is a kind-hearted person. I’m not a leech; I just want to earn some honest money.”

Yu Jianfu glared at him.

Cui Dongshan laughed and withdrew his hand, raising one to reveal the stamp. “Sister Yu, you look even better when you’re angry.”

Yu Jianfu reached out, taking the item out of thin air. It wasn’t any stamp from the Hundred Sword Immortal Seal or the Bi Sword Immortal Seal. Lowering her gaze, she read the inscription.

**Edge Text:** Stone in the stream, how can it not be a middle pillar? Beautiful clouds in the sky, the fist still lingers on high.

The inscription read: **Woman Martial God, beside Chen Cao.**

Yu Jianfu tightly gripped this stamp, remaining silent for a long time before looking up and saying, “I lost. Speak, and I will convey a message to the family.”

The truly impressive aspect wasn’t just knowing the aliases Stone in the Stream and Yu Qiyun, but the fact that he was clearly aware of the intricate relationship between her and her family, as well as Zhou Shenzhi. 

What was even more significant was his ability to calculate human nature, accurately predicting that Yu Jianfu would sincerely agree with Chen Ping’an’s words. He anticipated that once she lost, she would willingly agree to convey a message to her family, no longer wandering aimlessly, but beginning to genuinely contribute as a Yu family member. 

What did this imply? It meant that he needed her to send that message to the ancestors, and regardless of how the Yu family reacted upon hearing it, they would at least reluctantly accept this incense offering! 

He also gauged that Yu Jianfu’s greatest wish on her martial path was to catch up to Cao Ci and Chen Ping’an, never wanting to merely watch the backs of those two men growing further away!

Yu Jianfu’s expression turned somber. After waiting for a moment, she noticed he still hadn’t spoken again. Looking up, she declared firmly, “I’m willing to gamble and accept defeat! Please speak!”

Cui Dongshan looked at her, smiled, and said, “You’re still a rather lovely young lady.”

Yu Jianfu was taken aback. “Just this one sentence?”

The previous words were exceedingly strange, to the point of being bizarre!

“Old man of the Yu family, hurry and find a secluded spot, then shout three times, ‘Who is the stinky chess basket if not me? I like to regret moves; who have I ever beaten?’”

Could it be that Zhu Mei’s words were actually spot on? 

After all, these words were merely a message she needed to convey. Once the message was delivered, it mattered not whether the ancestors acted or not. 

Cui Dongshan picked up the small coin, the inscription of which was notably rare, likely a unique item in existence. A small coin like this would be sought after by those “coin collectors” among immortals. Sister Yu, the noblewoman, would surely have a considerable dowry when she marries. It’s a pity about that potential, though; her fate is unfortunate; she has no fortune to enjoy it. The most unfortunate is not dying, but merely watching the Yu sister, who once looked down on him, now actually looking up to him, marry another.

Thinking of this, Cui Dongshan felt a small sense of accomplishment and thought that in the future, he would have a chance to boast about this to his senior sister.

Cui Dongshan kept his left hand pressed on the last stamp, smiling, “Sister Yu, how about one last bet? If I win, you’ll send another message to Zhou Shenzhi. But if I lose, you can disregard anything regarding the Yu family, and I’ll return this coin to you. After all, it counts as me making a careless mistake, losing everything. How about it?”

Yu Jianfu pondered for a moment. Even if she was nearly guaranteed to win in this final round, she still opted not to gamble, merely trusting her intuition as a woman.

Yu Jianfu shook her head, “I won’t bet!”

The young man burst into laughter, “Sister Yu’s betting luck seems poor, yet in reality, it’s quite good. And why do I say that? You’ll know the answer soon enough, and it’ll happen today.”

Yu Jianfu glared, “Are you still trying to provoke me? When will it end?!”

Cui Dongshan grasped the stamp he had been hiding, tossing it gently to Yu Jianfu. “This is for you, as an apology from me, a student, to your teacher.”

Yu Jianfu received the stamp, utterly stunned. “Impossible, this stamp was already bought by an unknown sword immortal. Even Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan couldn’t trace who bought it. You’ve only been at the Sword Qi Great Wall for a few days… How could you possibly know? It can only be this stamp…”

Cui Dongshan, playing the role of a naive child, sighed and lamented, “In the great gamble of the world, winning relies on luck.”

Cui Dongshan gathered all the items that Yu Jianfu had turned down, standing up. “These trivial items will be a generous gift from Sister Yu to me. Just thinking about becoming familiar with Sister Yu in the future makes me truly happy.”

Yu Jianfu remained seated, raising her head. “Who exactly are you?”

How could he refer to her ancestor as “the old man of the Yu family” and a “stinky chess basket,” even directly naming Zhou Shenzhi as “Zhou Shenzhi”? 

The young man in white smiled, “I’m Dongshan.”

Cui Dongshan walked away in large strides, going off to find someone else.

After taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped, turning his head back with a smile. “Sister Yu, from now on, don’t make choices in front of others by tossing coins to decide between heads or tails. I won’t say all, but the vast majority of the time, what you think is some ethereal luck is really just your lack of cultivation. Luck, whether good or bad, isn’t in you, nor is it in heaven. Today, it’s in me; you can still bear it. What about in the future? Today, you’re just Yu Jianfu the martial artist. In the future, you’ll be Yu Jianfu of the Yu family. My teacher’s words, I just hope you contemplate them night and day.”

Yu Jianfu fell silent.

The stamp in her hand bore no edge text, only the inscription.

**A Wild Goose Crashes Against the Wall.**

Yu Jianfu turned her gaze.

The young man in white was practicing punches along the city wall, making loud sounds, his voice not small—likely a style of boxing that could be considered akin to “Turtle Style.” The bitter summer sword immortal was teaching the sword arts of the Shao Yuan Dynasty’s youth.

According to the rules of the Sword Qi Great Wall, once one stood atop the city wall, there were no rules. If one wished to establish their own rules, they had to rely on their sword.

The bitter summer sword immortal was an outsider with decent sword skills, yet his temperament was gentle. Given his current reputation among the young talents of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, he naturally wouldn’t target a white-clad young man sitting far away watching them practice swordplay. Moreover, that young man only glanced at them a few times before quickly returning to his book. The bitter summer sword immortal caught a glimpse of the book title—it was a chess manual named *The Quick Joy Pavilion Manual,* widely circulated in the Central Plains, particularly in the Shao Yuan Dynasty. It explained life-and-death problems, and one of its prefaces was especially well-regarded: “My methods of play depend on the opponent’s greatest countermeasure, waiting for the strong to confront the strong, and then gradually defeating the stronger. Isn’t that delightful?”

The bitter summer sword immortal chuckled. This individual must have a considerable cultivation level but concealed it well; even he found it hard to see through him at a glance. Hence, he couldn’t be a Dragon Gate disciple of the Ocean-viewing realm, but whether he was a Golden Core or Nascent Soul practitioner among earth immortals was hard to say.

Was he trying to disrupt the proceedings with chess? This “youth” of indeterminate age might have wandered into the wrong place.

Aside from imparting swordsmanship, the bitter summer sword immortal also encouraged these future pillars of the Shao Yuan Dynasty to cultivate themselves and seek out opportunities.

The young man from the Confucian Sage lineage displayed notable patience, sitting there studying the chess manual. He even took out his chess pieces and began to play alone.

During a break, all the young sword cultivators intentionally avoided the white-clad youth, not out of fear of him or his teacher Chen Ping’an, but rather out of respect for Chen Ping’an’s elder brother.

When it came to the left-hand senior’s sword strikes, they all had a tacit understanding and refrained from discussing it. However, in the private quarters of Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan, they had spoken plenty.

“The Great Sword Immortal Yue Qing merely said a few words about the Confucian Sage lineage’s incense—why would the left-hand senior want to contend over life and death? Just because his swordsmanship is high? As expected of a disciple from the Confucian Sage lineage, their principles truly run deep.”

“The Great Sword Immortal Yue Qing has achieved great feats in the Sword Qi Great Wall, having experienced countless battles and slain countless monsters! If the left-hand senior were to seriously injure Yue Qing or even kill him outright, wouldn’t the wild and savage world have to present the left-hand senior with a gold plaque to express their gratitude?”

“Over trivial matters, they want to resort to violence? How could the Great Sword Immortal Yue Qing have spoken incorrectly? The decline of the Confucian Sage lineage’s incense is entirely self-inflicted. Thankfully, the knowledge from the Confucian Sage lineage was prohibited. Lucky for our Shao Yuan Dynasty, which had the quickest and most thorough prohibitions back in the day. Otherwise, if this lineage’s knowledge were to dominate the vast world, it would indeed be entertaining. Small-mindedness leads to chaos. It’s fortunate this place is the narrow Sword Qi Great Wall; otherwise, in the vast world, who knows what kind of massive blunder might arise from relying on swordsmanship?”

However, while these young people were filled with righteous indignation, they were unaware that Sword Immortal Ku Xia sat beside Sun Juyuan, wearing an even more bitter expression.

Sun Juyuan, wearing loose sleeves, sat in the corridor with a “Wine Spring” cup, drinking wine and smiling as he asked, “Ku Xia, do you think these kids truly believe what they say or are they just pretending to be foolish?”

Ku Xia didn’t provide an answer.

Because neither answer was particularly good.

Sun Juyuan seemed more resigned than Ku Xia, even too lazy to get angry, merely smiling. “A rabble, noisy and bothersome.”

Ku Xia let out a sigh of relief.

At least he could still stay in the Sun residence.

However, Sun Juyuan’s last remark left Ku Xia feeling helpless. “In the vast world, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t speak whatever you want. Here, it’s precisely the opposite; you can speak whatever you want, but you can’t eat whatever you want. I’ll say this much: if you encounter trouble in the future, don’t come to me for help. I, Sun Juyuan, am just a minor Jade Purity stage sword cultivator, not enough to be chopped by a few swords. What’s more, even being chopped would yield nothing good; why bother? I find it strange. The Shao Yuan Dynasty should also be a place of considerable culture. How come these young kids, who presumably have read numerous books, seem to forget the principles in them? After indulging in lavish feasts, they merely produce excrement to fill the latrines? Is there no use in that? But if they devour knowledge only to regurgitate it, how can they sense the foulness of their own mouths and the mouths of others?”

“I’ll say this in advance: if they speak such words in the Sun residence, it’ll be one thing; after all, my Sun residence’s reputation has already been tarnished. But if they go out and shout about it, the Sun residence won’t be helping to collect or stop their corpses.”

Sword Immortal Ku Xia still remembered the last cold gaze from Sun Juyuan and that final remark: “After all, our Sword Qi Great Wall is a poor and remote place, where reading and writing is rare. Being careless with one’s actions can lead to a loss of life, difficult to piece together.”

When Ku Xia announced a half-hour break, Zhu Mei immediately ran off to find Yu Jianfu, eager to inform her that the troublemaker Cui Dongshan had arrived.

Jin Zhenmeng continued sitting alone on a mat in a corner, silently searching for the threads of sword intent hidden within the sword qi. 

Lin Junbi sat on his mat, answering questions for several sword cultivators.

Only Yan Lu stood up and approached the young man named Cui Dongshan, leaping onto the city wall. He glanced at the chessboard and asked with a smile, “Is it the life-and-death problem from Master Xilu’s *Quick Joy Pavilion Manual*?”

Cui Dongshan lifted his head, casting a glance at Yan Lu but remained silent, lowering his head to continue solving the problems alone.

Yan Lu chuckled, “Are you staying here to play chess with someone? Do you want to consult Junbi about chess technique? I advise you to give up on that thought; Junbi won’t come over here.”

Cui Dongshan didn’t look up, replying, “Jiang Guancheng, if you’re trying to build connections with my master through me, I would advise you to leave quickly.”

Jiang Guancheng? 

Yan Lu couldn’t help but chuckle.

Cui Dongshan raised his head, “What’s wrong? You, the disciple of the Sub-Sage lineage, want to have a contest of wits with me on the chessboard?”

Yan Lu shook his head, his smile calm, demeanor composed. “You’ve mistaken me. Although I’m not a disciple of the Sub-Sage lineage, I understand well that the Sub-Sage lineage’s students abide by rules and adhere to the teachings of sages, never engaging in pointless conflicts. The principles are in books and within the heart, not on swords or fists, and certainly not on the chessboard. If I, who am not from the Sub-Sage lineage, knows this truth, how much more so for the thousands of students from the Sub-Sage lineage?”

Cui Dongshan raised an eyebrow, “Your name is Yan Lu, not that Jiang Guancheng whose family tomb emitted smoke at the wrong time, with two elders who were once scholars of the academy?”

Yan Lu’s expression turned stern, speaking in a low voice, “Choose your words carefully!”

Cui Dongshan waved his hand, one hand pinching his nose while the other held the chess manual, looking sideways at Yan Lu, “I won’t speak of that Jiang Guancheng, but I’ll say this about you: is your ancestor the one who, every time the Qing Shan God hosts a wine banquet, never receives an invitation yet shamelessly shows up for a drink? The renowned Yan Big Flatterer of the Central Plains? Every time he drinks, even if he’s merely at the last seat, he still forces his way to toast others, and after leaving the Bamboo Sea Cave, he immediately flaunts, ‘Not only did I drink at the Qing Shan God’s banquet, but I also drank with so-and-so’?”

“How fortunate that someone was too ignorant to understand the rules of the banquet and carelessly revealed the secret. Otherwise, I reckon the name Yan Big Flatterer wouldn’t have reached the level it has today. Don’t you think so, Young Master Yan?”

Yan Lu’s face turned pale.

Cui Dongshan blinked innocently, “It’s just words, light as a feather. Where’s the spirit of a scholar? Why do you want to kill me? Moreover, how can you be so sure that it’s justified to kill me? Aren’t you afraid I might be timid and die of fright? Aren’t you worried that my master might turn you into paste?”

Yan Lu’s hands clenched into fists, yet he ultimately managed to smile faintly.

Cui Dongshan set down the chess piece and manual, taking a deep breath and adopting a posture that seemed to draw energy. “Look at that, I can also speak your principles. Indeed, it feels much simpler and more comfortable to discuss your principles.”

Cui Dongshan waved his hand, a look of disdain on his face. “Yan Family’s little flatterer, hurry and retreat. Go home and lick your ancestor’s backside; your ancestor’s skills are so high that even the leftover scraps can fill you up. Why are you still here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, wagging your tail behind Lin Junbi? Practicing swordsmanship? You should be practicing your own skills.”

Just as Yan Lu was about to draw his sword, Lin Junbi stood up. “Enough, Cui Dongshan. I’ll play chess with you. This exchange of words is best left unsaid.”

Cui Dongshan pinched his nose and waved, “Young Master Lin, please sit down quickly. I can only rely on your celestial aura to help dispel this urine smell.”

Yan Lu, on the verge of drawing his sword, was halted by the bitter summer sword immortal’s words. “The left-hand senior won’t draw his sword for himself, but will for the Confucian Sage lineage, regardless of who you are or your cultivation level.”

Yan Lu’s face turned pale, and he leaped down from the city wall, returning to the mat.

As he brushed past Lin Junbi, the latter patted Yan Lu on the shoulder, smiling, “I’m here. My swordsmanship may not be good, but my chess skills are decent, right?”

Yan Lu, filled with grievances and humiliation, nodded heavily.

Lin Junbi shook his sleeves, lightly sitting opposite the chessboard.

Cui Dongshan rubbed his hands together, his face filled with surprise and envy. “Young Master Lin, your demeanor is so ethereal. It must have been innate, right? How else could you be so fluid and graceful? Absolutely impossible; it has to be an invisible innate talent!”

Lin Junbi smiled, “I’ve said, the exchange of words isn’t interesting. Let’s just play chess. If you keep being unreasonable, I won’t play chess with you.”

Cui Dongshan straightened up, “What shall we bet?”

Lin Junbi shook his head, “No bets; the chessboard only determines victory or defeat.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “Playing chess without stakes—what’s the point? I’m here to earn money…”

At this point, Cui Dongshan turned his head, already showing a bit of a chess player’s demeanor, waving enthusiastically, “Sister Yu, over here! I’ll play chess with Young Master Lin, and let’s see how I beat him!”

Lin Junbi also raised his head, but compared to Cui Dongshan’s unrestrained words, the handsome Lin Junbi merely smiled helplessly at Yu Jianfu.

Yu Jianfu’s expression was blank.

Zhu Mei couldn’t help but chuckle, affectionately calling Yu Jianfu “In the Stream.” Then she sighed, “He really is a fool.”

Yu Jianfu’s heart was filled with mixed emotions.

It was as she expected; Cui Dongshan had calculated that Zhu Mei would mention this to her, anticipating her appearance. Naturally, her presence as a member of the Yu family would incite a bit of competitive spirit in a person like Lin Junbi. For cultivators, even the tiniest thought could be significant.

In the end, it was all part of Cui Dongshan’s scheme.

Yu Jianfu didn’t approach the two players. Instead, she sat cross-legged, beginning to chew on her flatbread, while Zhu Mei wanted to join the chessboard excitement but was stopped by Yu Jianfu, who kept her company with idle chatter.

Cui Dongshan turned to Yu Jianfu’s back and softly lamented, “I wish my Sister Yu would look at me one more time to help boost my chess skills and chances of winning.”

Lin Junbi remained quiet and focused.

Cui Dongshan turned back, “A small bet, just a copper coin.”

Lin Junbi asked, “A copper coin?”

“Why not? One snowy flower coin wouldn’t be considered a small bet, right?” 

Cui Dongshan exclaimed, “Young Master Lin, you’re really wealthy.”

Lin Junbi chuckled, “Where should I go to find you a copper coin? After all, thinking of losing isn’t much, but winning bigger is. Winning a copper coin from me carries more significance than winning a rainy season coin. In the future, it’ll be more memorable for the audience.”

Cui Dongshan was stunned. “My celestial, unfathomable thoughts have been hidden so well, and Young Master Lin could see right through them?! That copper coin in my pocket is at great risk of leaving home and marrying someone else!”

Lin Junbi had to admit he was also disgusted by the young man before him. Of course, it was still a million times better than Yan Lu, who had already become a great joke. Their conversation today would likely be spread throughout the Shao Yuan Dynasty.

After all, for Yan Lu, whether he gained anything from practicing swordsmanship at the Sword Qi Great Wall was hard to say. For cultivators, any lingering grievances would be hard to shake off, and involving family reputation made it even trickier. At the very least, it would cause Yan Lu to lose a few points from what he could have gained.

Lin Junbi said, “It’s settled then, winning or losing is just a copper coin. Shall we guess who goes first?”

Cui Dongshan asked, “Young Master Lin, with your exceptional chess skills, wouldn’t you be willing to let me have three pieces? You don’t want to return home victorious with just a copper coin, do you?”

Lin Junbi had already reached for the chess pieces, his hand clenching them, feeling helpless. “Can’t we adhere to some rules? You and I are from the same mountain, but while playing chess, we still have to follow the rules from below, right?”

The young man, who had previously been sitting with his butt raised, now stared wide-eyed, ears perked up. Lin Junbi could have concealed the sound of his pieces, but he couldn’t afford to underestimate the young man’s potential. If he was at the Earth Immortal level, it would still be a loss for him. However, chess is a two-player game, and Lin Junbi couldn’t have the bitter summer sword immortal watch over them.

Cui Dongshan sat back down, nodding, “You can take the first move. Young Master Lin’s chess skills are still to be determined, but your chess skills outside the board are truly impressive. Compared to that Yan Lu, who almost smashed his own face with his own principles, you’re far superior.”

Lin Junbi loosened his grip and picked up a handful of chess pieces.

The truly impressive part was that with Lin Junbi having the upper hand, he could force his opponent, even if they were a five-realm martial artist, to follow the rules. Though not all matters in the world work this way, it should be the case here on the chessboard.

The young sword cultivators observing from a distance were filled with admiration.

In the matter of guessing who goes first, Cui Dongshan took out a small coin, tossed it, watched it land heads up, and succeeded in guessing correctly.

As Zhu Mei pulled Yu Jianfu’s face toward the game, Yu Jianfu rubbed her head, feeling a headache coming on.

The two sides began to place their pieces.

Lin Junbi displayed a calm demeanor, using a rare ancient manual titled *The Little Peach Blossom Spring Manual* to establish his opening strategy.

The cleverness lay in achieving a swift resolution, while the essence rested in the ten characters: “Acting with great rules, making unreasonable first moves.” However, it could hardly withstand the scrutiny of a top-tier player, especially since Lin Junbi had already studied this manual, making it evident who truly held the upper hand on the chessboard.

Lin Junbi placed his pieces neither quickly nor slowly, while Cui Dongshan’s pieces flew with confidence, as if victory was assured.

Lin Junbi intentionally concealed his moves during several key moments.

The game continued for over two hundred and thirty moves before it finally ended.

Just a copper coin.

Moreover, if he truly believed that winning this game would cause Yan Lu to weep with gratitude, he was mistaken.

Winning once again would not mean that Yan Lu’s reputation would be saved by a young boy from the Shao Yuan Dynasty.

Lin Junbi could only lose, and losing by a hair’s breadth, while pouring his heart into the game but ultimately failing, would only invoke a minimal amount of gratitude from Yan Lu. 

For someone like Yan Lu, reputation was merely superficial; only tangible benefits would truly move him and make him remember Lin Junbi as a valuable ally.

After admitting defeat, Lin Junbi chuckled, “A copper coin, I really don’t have one on me. Don’t worry, when I reach the city, I’ll personally borrow one. I’ll keep borrowing until I get one. At that point, whether I deliver it myself or ask someone to help, it’ll be up to the winner to decide.”

Cui Dongshan let out a soft breath, gazing at the precarious situation of the chessboard for a moment before glancing back up, smiling, “No wonder, no wonder. Young Master Lin must have secretly studied the *Little Peach Blossom Spring Manual.* I would have known; my fail-proof opening strategy has always led opponents to concede by the mid-game.”

Lin Junbi smiled, unfazed. “It’s just a matter of taking advantage of the situation.”

Cui Dongshan thought for a moment, “Whether Young Master Lin will personally borrow the coin, I can’t just follow behind you. After all, I haven’t learned the essence of the Yan family’s principles. But if Young Master Lin does borrow the coin, I have an idea. If I win the second game, the stakes will be mine. I’ll show just a hint of the national player’s demeanor, and you won’t need to go yourself. Just have Sister Yu deliver the coin. If Young Master Lin wins… how is that possible? I’m afraid I have no hidden skills in chess. After all, all my chess techniques and tricks come from the efforts of others; those heavenly hands are unreasonable in my eyes…”

Lin Junbi put away his chess pieces, preparing to stand up.

Then he glanced and suddenly noticed that the *Quick Joy Pavilion Manual* had somehow ended up under the young man’s bottom.

Lin Junbi still maintained a calm expression.

This manual, written by the second best national player of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, had its first author as Lin Junbi’s own teacher, the national master of the Shao Yuan Dynasty.

However, this second-best national player had often exchanged chess techniques with Lin Junbi, so this Master Xilu was somewhat of a half-teacher, half-friend to him.

Cui Dongshan gathered the chess pieces into his container, his shoulder leaning awkwardly as he raised his rear and pulled out the manual, chuckling quietly, “The life-and-death problems in the manual are truly laughable, almost made me die laughing. It’s clearly a living-dead problem. After seeing so many, one might genuinely kill a living chess piece. Our Master Xilu’s intentions are profound and heartfelt; he doesn’t hesitate to ruin his own reputation just to show the world’s chess players what an example of a reverse case looks like. How admirable yet tragic! Young Master Lin, you must help introduce me to such a noble national player in the future. There hasn’t been one in the past, and there likely won’t be one in the future.”

Lin Junbi raised a hand, signaling the nearby “family members” to refrain from speaking any more “family talk.” 

Once they began, it wouldn’t be Cui Dongshan who would suffer, but Lin Junbi himself. Naturally, half of those people were genuinely angry on behalf of him and Master Xilu. The other half likely had come for that very purpose; they had stirred the pot, and after witnessing the spectacle, they could sit back and enjoy the show.

Lin Junbi wouldn’t give them that opportunity.

He halted the conversation, and if they dared to speak again, they would just be foolish.

As expected, no one spoke.

Cui Dongshan tossed the chess manual casually over the city wall, nodding to himself. “If it were to be picked up by the beasts of the wild world, they would surely understand it at a glance. From then on, it would seem like they were all seeking death, and the Sword Qi Great Wall would be worry-free, as would the vast world.”

Lin Junbi returned to his position, smiling. “This time, you’ve won the first move. Let’s play again. What shall we wager?”

Cui Dongshan grinned, “This time let’s make a bigger bet, a snowy flower coin! We can each create a life-and-death problem, how about it? Until one of us cannot solve it, that one loses. Of course, if I win, Young Master Lin will obediently send me a snowy flower coin.”

Lin Junbi shook his head, “No solving life-and-death problems; it’s still just chess.”

The other party clearly seemed prepared, not wanting to be led by the nose.

Cui Dongshan looked surprised, as if a bit unexpected.

Lin Junbi didn’t dare let his guard down. This young man’s chess skills were certainly not comparable to Yan Lu’s. His ability was undoubtedly not below his senior brother’s level at the border. As for just how high this person’s chess skills reached, it was still uncertain; he needed to pull on the young man’s collar and raise it a bit.

Lin Junbi was too lazy to take another look at the young man’s expression, extending his hand, “This time it’s your turn. I’ll guess first.”

With the next game, he would observe his opponent more closely.

After all, he had been dragged into this matter involving Master Xilu and the renowned *Quick Joy Pavilion Manual*.

However, the outcome of the chess game remained secondary; he didn’t care about the reputation of winning or losing. Would losing mean that Master Xilu would no longer be a top national player of the Central Plains? Would the *Quick Joy Pavilion Manual* be excluded from the list of famous manuals?

In the second game of chess, Lin Junbi took a long time to think.

The young man in white took even longer, finally no longer feigning distraction or occasionally putting on a difficult act, slightly furrowing his brows.

Once again, victory and defeat teetered on a knife’s edge.

*(To Be Continued)*

 ### Chapter 716: Playing Chess Harms One’s Heart, Spicy Drinks Ruin One’s Stomach (Part Two)

This time, it was Lin Junbi's turn to gaze at the chessboard for a long time.

His opponent’s last three moves were all brilliant. 

The level of play surged, the tactics transformed, and the principles of the game were turned upside down. 

This left Lin Junbi caught off guard, and after the longest thinking session in their match, he had no choice but to concede defeat.

The expression of the young man in white was a bit peculiar. “Are you deeply engrossed in the sixth match of the Colorful Clouds Chess Manual? Since you have a counter-strategy, even if the outcome is uncertain, if you can withstand the current situation on the board, there’s still a chance. Why not play it out? Hiding your talents and burying yourself with them—does that really count as hiding your talents? Lin Gongzi, if you continue playing like this, it’s like giving away money. I might just have to challenge you to a rematch!”

Lin Junbi sighed. “Are you truly unaware, or are you just playing dumb?”

His opponent suddenly burst into laughter, speaking in a tone that conveyed his thoughts. “Of course I know! You, Lin Gongzi, want to use these two losses to make me think your understanding of the game resembles a fixed pattern. Then, when I suggest a third match, you can bet heavily and win everything, right? Lin Gongzi, you experts at chess from the big nations are so cunning; today I’ve truly learned something.”

Lin Junbi smiled and said, “In the third match, I’ll wager a small summer coin. I will give my all in this game.”

Cui Dongshan lightly waved his fist and shook his head. “That small summer coin that Sister Yu bought for my fan cannot be lost to you. As for the other small summer coins, feel free to choose; I don’t have any in my pocket anyway.”

Cui Dongshan turned to shout, “Sister Yu, don’t worry! Even if I lose everything, I will still keep this small summer coin that represents our deep bond!”

Yu Jianfu ignored him.

Zhu Mei muttered, “You can’t expect much from a dog’s mouth.”

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily. “Little girl, speak up! Our lineage under the Sage of Literature never takes offense when insulted to our faces. If there’s reason, we even give a thumbs up and say, ‘Well said!’ But to curse behind our backs, that’s fine too, just don’t let us hear it. Otherwise, flipping a book is like eating dung, and eating at the same time is like spewing filth—it’ll attract heavenly retribution!”

Zhu Mei, a bit panicked, sat even closer to Yu Jianfu.

Lin Junbi chuckled, “Any of those small summer coins will do.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly said, “Let’s add a little extra incentive. If I win, you’ll give me that Colorful Clouds Manual.”

Lin Junbi nodded. “Alright.”

The third match began.

Lin Junbi went first.

As a result, with the first move, he gained a significant advantage, just a few steps away from victory in the middle game. But he was nearly caught in an endless cycle where neither side could win. Although Lin Junbi maintained a calm demeanor, a surge of frustration finally bubbled up inside him.

The match dragged on to nearly four hundred moves!

For both players, this was an astonishing finish.

After so many moves, no one could accurately predict the outcome.

After one of Lin Junbi’s moves, he exhaled softly, feeling a bit more relaxed.

Cui Dongshan’s expression became serious. He pinched a chess piece, leaned forward, and extended his hand to place the piece down while shielding his sleeve with the other hand to avoid disturbing the chess pieces. Just as he was about to place his piece, Lin Junbi’s heart settled—the victory was his!

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan raised his hand, shaking Lin Junbi’s shoulder with a look of disbelief. “Haha, are you frustrated? Are you mad? I’m not going to play here. Oh dear, I’m quite the clever little rascal; my head may not be big, but it’s quite bright!”

This could be likened to the spirit of a senior sister taking over.

Everyone, including Zhu Mei—even Jin Zhenmeng, who didn’t particularly enjoy chess—was left dumbfounded.

Cui Dongshan pondered for a moment, then continued to play, but this time he placed the piece elsewhere on the board, then returned to his seat with hands tucked into his sleeves. “No more playing; being able to win three matches in a row against the illustrious Lin Junbi is satisfying enough.”

The young man in white looked up at the sky. “The moon is so round today.”

Well, it was broad daylight—there was no moon to see. The boy must have been reminded of that elder sister, Zhou Cheng.

Lin Junbi smiled. “I’ve lost. One copper coin, one snowflake coin, one small summer coin—I’ll present them all together later.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly sneered. “Oh? Listening to your tone, you seem quite indifferent to winning or losing? Do you think I’ve played four hundred moves with you and genuinely considered us evenly matched? Just having fun, right? Do you believe that in a fourth match, where we bet nothing, I could still win against a frog basking in the sun in the well of the Shao Yuan Dynasty in less than eighty moves?!”

Lin Junbi chuckled. “Oh?”

Cui Dongshan grinned cheekily. “You really believe that? I’ve won three matches, and the money I earned isn’t much. Am I not allowed to boast a little for fun?”

Cui Dongshan’s grin faded as he looked over the complicated board, clicking his tongue. “You and I are brothers who have created such a divine game together; it’s almost explosive with how exhilarating it is!”

At this moment, no one dared to underestimate this person’s chess skills.

Yan Lu was even more so.

Aside from the borders, his chess skills were the closest to Lin Junbi’s, so he increasingly understood how high the young man in white’s skills were.

Thus, he shifted from pure resentment to a mix of fear. He still hated him, perhaps even more so, but deep down, he couldn’t help but feel an additional sense of trepidation.

Cui Dongshan waved at Lin Junbi, who was squatting like a toad, and with sincere eyes, said, “You can give me the money later; it doesn’t matter if you do it yourself. Lin Gongzi, I’m going to tidy up the chessboard. So? Need help? You’ve already helped me three times; I think I’ll pass. If you keep this up, my conscience will be uneasy. It’s as if fate is preventing me from being friends with someone as generous as you; I can’t sleep at night!”

Lin Junbi sighed.

Since they had played the third match, this would likely be regarded as a famous match throughout the history of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, so the outcome was still acceptable.

As Cui Dongshan began to pack up the pieces, he showed no grace, carelessly tossing the pieces into a jar with a crisp sound while muttering to himself, “Winning three matches in a row is so satisfying, truly satisfying. But you know, winning by relying on a disparity in skills isn’t interesting at all. If both sides had equal skill, then winning or losing would depend on luck. If luck is on my side and I win again, that would be the most enjoyable. I estimate Lin Gongzi has had too smooth a ride on the chessboard throughout his life, and he’s so used to overpowering others that he wouldn’t be able to appreciate my feelings. What a pity, what a pity.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly asked, “What? Do you think my skills are too high or that my luck is on my side? Both answers are wrong? As for how skilled I am, I know that well enough. But whether my luck is good or not, you have to acknowledge that, Lin Gongzi. So let’s have another round, but in a different way, shall we? This time, it’s not just about skill, but luck—are you game? We can even say that we’re only betting on luck. You might never have another chance to play this kind of chess in your life. Since it’s all about luck, we won’t bet any money or anything.”

Lin Junbi asked, “What do you mean by that?”

Cui Dongshan grinned. “You decide the outcome of this chess game. Whether you win or lose, just discuss it beforehand with the Sword Immortal of Bitter Summer. As long as the outcome on the board aligns with what you say, no matter whether I win or lose, it will still be your victory. We’re just betting on whose luck is better—are you up for it?!”

Lin Junbi was left speechless with laughter.

Cui Dongshan continued jokingly, “Forget about the skills of the chess and sword; just looking at the character of the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal and your betting honesty, I still believe in you, Lin Gongzi.”

Lin Junbi shook his head. “I won’t play that kind of chess.”

Cui Dongshan surprisingly nodded. “Indeed, it’s not interesting enough. So I’ll add another condition: in the third match of that often-revisited Colorful Clouds Manual, at the midgame—well, it’s actually just the fifty-sixth move—someone conceded defeat. How about we help both sides finish it? Then you can still decide the outcomes outside the chessboard. Does the victory on the board really matter? Not at all. You can help the lord of Baidi City, and I’ll help the person playing against him. How about that? Look at the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal; he’s already eager to see Lin Gongzi turn the tables in this match.”

Lin Junbi was at a loss for words.

This person was a lunatic.

The Colorful Clouds Manual was regarded by all chess players as “I observe the colorful clouds in the world, standing high and unreachable,” because the winner of the game is invincible. What’s even more frightening is that the one who loses, as long as they rise from the board and leave Baidi City, is also invincible outside of Cloud City.

Countless chess players have deeply studied the follow-up of the third match, even Lin Junbi’s master is no exception. It is said that Cui Yi’s timing of conceding was neither early nor late, precisely indicating that this person truly deserves the title of the second-best in the world of chess.

Thus, Lin Junbi shook his head. “I won’t play that kind of chess. As chess players, we shouldn’t insult the pieces on the board.”

Cui Dongshan sneered. “Do you have the right to insult the Colorful Clouds Manual? Lin Junbi, have you reached such a level in your chess skills? Just fifty-six moves, and only those with sufficient realm can see the outcome. Do the other players under the colorful clouds truly understand what both sides are thinking? If it were you and me playing, could you really maintain the lord of Baidi City’s advantage in the midgame? Who gave you that confidence? Is it because you lost three matches in a row?!”

Lin Junbi said solemnly, “I won’t discuss the outcomes outside the chessboard with the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal. I will play this remnant game with you!”

Cui Dongshan laughed. “Alright, let’s add another incentive. If I win, in the next round, you must discuss the outcome with the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal beforehand.”

Lin Junbi replied, “Let’s talk once you win this Colorful Clouds Manual first.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled. “Fortunately, Lin Gongzi didn’t say ‘once you win against me first,’ otherwise even someone as admiring of your celestial demeanor as me would have to spit on the chessboard.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal looked increasingly troubled.

The other young sword cultivators, even Jin Zhenmeng, were full of anticipation for this match.

Cui Dongshan suddenly turned and said, “Those irrelevant people don’t have the right to watch this match. Of course, if they really want to, it’s fine—just one Grain Rain coin per person. Everyone, be generous and bring it out.”

Zhu Mei raised her hand. “I want to watch; I’ll sponsor Sister Yu’s Grain Rain coin.”

Cui Dongshan immediately changed his demeanor, standing tall and righteous. “What kind of joke is this? Sister Yu’s friend is my Dongshan’s friend. Talking about money? Are you slapping my face? Am I some roadside chess player who plays for money?”

Many, including Jiang Guancheng, were genuinely willing to contribute, but the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal started to chase people away, leaving no room for negotiation.

So on the city walls, only Yu Jianfu and Zhu Mei, supported by Yu Jianfu, remained.

The two sides arranged their pieces on the board, appearing to replay the game, but in reality, they were creating a new game outside of the third match of the Colorful Clouds Manual.

Half an incense stick later, Lin Junbi, deep in thought, inexplicably found himself trapped in the upper right corner. After only playing thirty-six new moves, his face turned pale, and he hesitated to concede defeat.

Cui Dongshan stated casually, “According to our agreement, the next match will be the second-to-last match of the Colorful Clouds Manual where one loses in the closing phase. There’s very little space left on the board, and the chances of an unexpected turn are minimal. You will still be playing for the lord of Baidi City. Remember, first discuss the outcomes with the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal. It’s just a battle of luck; don’t take the outcomes on the board too seriously. If I win again, I might just have to make a big request from you to play another match.”

Lin Junbi discussed the outcomes with the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal. 

Then both sides gathered their pieces again and set them up.

Compared to the previous match, this time, there were many pieces on the board.

Shortly after the incense stick burned out, the young man in white said with a smile, “Don’t worry, in this next match, I will first discuss the outcome with the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal. You and I will play chess again; since luck has favored me every time, I’ll kneel and beg for a loss, voluntarily switching the luck around. If I still win this time, so be it; it would only mean that today, my luck is truly too good. What does that have to do with Lin Gongzi’s chess skills? Not at all, not at all.”

Lin Junbi was sweating profusely, speechless and dazed. He neither wanted to concede defeat nor speak, as if he just wanted to observe the board a bit longer to understand how he was losing.

The young man in white spoke polite words, but his face bore a mocking smile.

Yu Jianfu sighed and pulled Zhu Mei away from the scene.

Indeed, Cui Dongshan had hit the nail on the head. 

Sister Yu’s earlier “luck” had actually been quite fortunate.

The young Zhu Mei understood the gravity of the situation and silently followed Yu Jianfu away from this troublesome place.

Just as the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal was about to speak, Cui Dongshan pinched a chess piece between two fingers and lightly spun it without looking up. “Observing the chess without speaking; can we have some decorum here? A dignified sword immortal of the Central Plains, and disciple of that Zhou Shenzhi, is here helping his junior protect the way like this? I’m friends with Lin Gongzi, so I’m easy-going, but if the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal relies on his swordsmanship and status, then I’ll have to call for help. Is this simple logic too hard for you to understand? If you don’t understand, there are people with better sword skills; I can ask them to teach you.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal’s hesitation turned into determination. Regardless of what the young man in white said, he stated firmly, “Lin Junbi, you are free to rise.”

Lin Junbi hesitated, his fists clenched tightly.

Cui Dongshan picked up a chess piece, gently pressed it onto the board, and casually slid it to the edge of Lin Junbi’s side. The small piece was half on the board and half in midair.

Cui Dongshan smiled. “Rise? Sure. If you concede defeat, it will only count as half a loss.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal exclaimed angrily, “You little brat, don’t push your luck! How dare you damage Lin Junbi’s determination?!”

Cui Dongshan, hands tucked into his sleeves, laughed heartily. “For someone who cultivates the Dao, a favored child of heaven, to have their determination ruined by a little chess is more dangerous than Yan Lu; this is truly going to make me die laughing.”

Cui Dongshan raised his head to look at the furious Bitter Summer Sword Immortal with a smile and asked, “If I die laughing, will it help Lin Junbi win the chess match?”

Lin Junbi trembled and said, “If I concede before the game starts, will I only lose half?”

Cui Dongshan nodded. “Of course. But there’s a small condition—you must promise never to touch a chessboard or chess pieces again in your life.”

Lin Junbi was drenched in sweat.

Cui Dongshan yawned, showing no rush for Lin Junbi to make a decision, clearly a bit bored.

The world only knows the Colorful Clouds Manual as the Colorful Clouds Manual.

They have no idea what kind of deep scheming is at play between the players who can create the Colorful Clouds Game.

Now that’s what we call real chess.

You little brats who have only learned a bit from the Colorful Clouds Manual dare to call yourselves chess masters?!

Cui Dongshan, as if chatting with an acquaintance, slowly said, “The works of my teacher’s teacher are only found in your Shao Yuan Dynasty’s study. Now, how many copies remain in the homes of the emperor, princes, and merchants? Two? Not even one? This is no small matter; willing to bet and accept losses, making moves without regrets. But I seem to recall a small incident—you guys traveled thousands of miles to smash that dilapidated statue outside the Confucian Temple, and there were scholars from your Shao Yuan Dynasty among them, right? I heard that after returning home, your career flourished, and you rose to prominence? That person, who is not only your chess friend but also a bosom companion, oh yes, is the owner of that chess manual lying by the city’s foundation—the famous Master Xi Lu.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal’s heart stirred, wanting to speak to persuade Lin Junbi, but now he found himself unable to voice a word.

Mi Yu, the sword cultivator of the Jade Purity realm, a local cultivator of the Sword Qi Great Wall, dared not move when he encountered that person.

At this moment, the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal was in a similar situation.

But Lin Junbi was currently lost and dazed, and his realm was still too low to realize the awkwardness of his position.

Cui Dongshan scoffed at Lin Junbi. “Incentives? From now on, every time I win a game, I’ll have you forced to play again, even if it’s just an extra small summer coin each time. I can make you lose everything in your future cultivation, even half of the Shao Yuan Dynasty. I’ll make you wish you could reincarnate right now, never to touch chess again! Do you think playing against me is something you can just choose to not play if you don’t want to? Huh?!”

“Do you even know who you’re playing chess with?!”

Cui Dongshan waved his sleeve dramatically. “Remember, I’m Dongshan!”

Cao Qinglang met Pei Qian in the corridor.

Pei Qian hesitated, wanting to say something but ultimately staying silent. 

Cao Qinglang pointed to his heart, then waved his hand, not speaking but offering a faint smile.

Pei Qian remained silent.

Cao Qinglang smiled and asked, “I have a carving knife; would you like me to make you a stamp later?”

Pei Qian walked away in anger.

Cao Qinglang scratched his head, realizing he had waited long enough for his turn to come.

That day, a sneaky young man in white stealthily knocked on the door of the Ning residence. Nalan Yexing chuckled, “Dongshan, what’s going on? Isn’t knocking unnecessary for a thief?”

Cui Dongshan, feeling frustrated, replied, “Nalan ge, I worked hard on the city walls today and only earned a little money. I'm so mad I can’t face the teacher!”

Nalan Yexing felt a bit sorry for the one who had to earn money, though he didn’t know who was so unfortunate.

Just as Nalan Yexing was about to close the door and part ways with this little rascal, Cui Dongshan suddenly smiled. “Let’s go drink at your place, ge!”

Nalan Yexing, of course, was reluctant, but after seeing the glint in the young man’s eyes, he nodded.

Once they arrived, Cui Dongshan took out two jars of wine, while Nalan Yexing hoped it would be from the stash he had worked hard to hide.

But the conversation that followed gradually made Nalan Yexing lose that little concern.

What the young man said was far too significant for Nalan Yexing, a fallen Jade Purity realm sword cultivator.

The reasoning was simple; what he spoke of was about how Nalan Yexing should walk his path of the Dao.

And soon, there was a knock at the door.

Old Granny Bai quickly left.

It was that Jin Dan sword cultivator, Cui Wei, who was no longer an anonymous disciple of Nalan Yexing.

After closing the door, Cui Wei cupped his hands in a bow, not looking up or speaking.

Nalan Yexing wanted to get up and leave but was stopped by Cui Dongshan, who was smiling.

Then Cui Dongshan turned and asked, “Do you want to break through again and take the risk, or follow me to the Vast and Righteous World and prolong the inevitable? Today or tomorrow might not matter; you’ll just feel lucky. But I can assure you, there will come a day when your conscience will ache, Cui Wei.”

Cui Wei kept his head down, cupping his hands. “Cui Wei is willing to follow the teacher to Baopingzhou. I’ll regret it tomorrow, and we’ll discuss it then.”

Cui Dongshan smiled. “Alright, I promise. But I want to hear your reasons. Rest assured, no matter what, my recognition or lack thereof won’t change your future stability.”

Cui Wei was silent for a moment. “Why should I die here?”

Nalan Yexing sighed, not getting as furious as before, almost unable to restrain himself from slapping Cui Wei to the ground. 

Cui Dongshan nodded. “Good question. After we reach a distant land, you can take your time answering this question when you’re free or when you’re old. Go on; you’ve worked hard these years.”

Cui Wei didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he knelt on the ground, facing Nalan Yexing, and bowed three times. “The master doesn’t acknowledge his disciple, but the disciple acknowledges the second teacher on his path of cultivation! Cui Wei will not look back after this; Master, please take care!”

Nalan Yexing raised a white bowl, took a sip of wine, and nodded. “Since you’ve chosen to go to the Vast and Righteous World, then don’t half-heartedly live; try to live a few hundred or thousand more years.”

Cui Wei left that place and returned to his residence.

Cui Dongshan drank his fill and soon left the house as well.

Only an old man, without children or disciples, remained alone to drink, with the table seemingly devoid of even a single dish to accompany the wine.

That evening, Qi Jinglong brought his disciple, Bai Shou, to visit the Ning residence.

Bai Shou displayed the spirit of one willing to face death.

But then came an unexpected joy! First, it was said that Pei Qian had been practicing martial arts with an elderly lady from the Ning residence and was currently lying on a sickbed.

However, after the jubilation that felt like a celebration, Bai Shou couldn’t help but worry. After all, Pei Qian was just a young girl, so the boy inquired about directions and wandered toward Pei Qian’s home, not daring to knock but taking a stroll outside.

As for the boy’s master, he had already gone to visit his good brother, Chen Pingan.

Inside the house, however, were three people.

Chen Pingan, Cui Dongshan, and Qi Jinglong.

Each took out a booklet.

Chen Pingan’s booklet contained the most miscellaneous information.

Cui Dongshan’s booklet was the thickest, its contents sourced from the assassins and spies that the Great Li’s Xiu Hu had planted in the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Upside-Down Mountain. There weren’t many, but each was quite useful.

Some were newly acquired, while more were from the top-secret files of the Great Li.

Of course, not long ago, Cui Dongshan had made a round through the city. He wasn’t truly trying to find more clues on his own; he never considered himself a god who can see the big picture from a small detail. The premise is “seeing.” Ultimately, time was too short, and with his identity as a disciple of the Sage of Literature, it became more complicated. Otherwise, he could grasp more details that were much closer to the truth, or even the truth itself.

Qi Jinglong’s information came from indirect channels through the sect leader and disciples of the Taihui Sword Sect.

Cui Dongshan waved his sleeve, and a piece of snow-white rice paper appeared in mid-air above the two tables. With a thought, the paper rose, depicting the various mansions and streets within the city.

Then Cui Dongshan handed each of them three pens. The paper would return to its original state with no damage done, but it could still be written on.

Different pens would write in different colors: black, white, and gray.

The three were silent, each writing down a name.

If the same name appeared in different colors, Cui Dongshan would circle it with the unique red pen in his hand.

Three booklets lay on the table, and during pauses, anyone could flip through the other two.

That evening, Qi Jinglong and Bai Shou left the Ning residence and returned to the Taihui Sword Sect’s armory residence. Chen Pingan took Cui Dongshan to the tavern.

But they weren’t really heading there; after taking a detour, Chen Pingan asked Cui Dongshan to keep an eye on their surroundings, eventually leading them to a shabby house in a back alley. There was no small talk, but it was definitely not a place of luxury.

Cui Dongshan did not enter but stood outside. After his teacher went inside, he then squatted at the corner of the two alleys, feeling a bit bored.

Only Pei Qian remained unaware that during this journey, they, as students, wouldn’t be staying long at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

His teacher merely hoped they could see for themselves what the Sword Qi Great Wall was truly like, to witness those grand scenes they would never see again.

Tao Wen sat back at the table and asked, “What brings you here? Aren’t you afraid I won’t sit in as the dealer next time?”

Chen Pingan smiled. “In this place of trickery, there are many traps, and those gambling fools who are poor at gambling shouldn’t try to play tricks with me.”

Tao Wen said, “Chen Pingan, don’t forget the promise you made to me. To you, it may seem like a small matter; to me, it’s not a big deal, but it’s also not small.”

Chen Pingan nodded. “Many of the things I promised myself might not be accomplished. However, I generally keep my promises to others.”

Tao Wen nodded. The young man had initially said when he first asked to sit in as the dealer that he would not earn a single snowflake coin at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Tao Wen teasingly said, “Is this what the second shopkeeper said, or is it just the pure martial artist Chen Pingan speaking?”

Chen Pingan chuckled. “It’s the swordsman Chen Pingan speaking.”

Tao Wen remained silent for a long time, then Chen Pingan, smiling, took out two jars of Bamboo Sea Cave wine, of course, the cheapest kind.

Tao Wen didn’t use any magical powers to fetch cups; he simply got up from the kitchen and brought back two wine bowls, which were naturally much larger than those from a tavern.

As Tao Wen drank, after pouring a second bowl, he said, “Chen Pingan, don’t imitate me.”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “I won’t.”

Tao Wen nodded. “Then there’s only one thing left—don’t die. Don’t forget, this is the Sword Qi Great Wall, not the Vast and Righteous World. This isn’t your hometown.”

Chen Pingan replied, “I’ll strive for it.”

Tao Wen raised his wine bowl, and Chen Pingan followed suit, gently clinking their bowls and drinking.

Tao Wen asked, “In the Vast and Righteous World, are there many people like you?”

Chen Pingan thought carefully and shook his head. “There aren’t many like me. But there are many who are better than me and many who are worse.”

Then Chen Pingan asked, “Aren’t you going to take a look?”

Tao Wen chuckled softly.

That question felt a bit unnecessary. It didn’t seem like the meticulous, cunning second shopkeeper.

Then they silently drank their wine.

When they were nearly at the last bowl of wine, Chen Pingan raised his bowl but then set it down again, pulling out a pair of stamps from his sleeve and gently placing them on the table. “I don’t know if Uncle Tao would like to accept these little things.”

Tao Wen shook his head. “I’m not interested. Flowery writing is for you scholars. I’m a swordsman, so it’s best to leave it be. Keeping it at home is useless; it’ll just gather dust. You might as well take it and earn some money to return what you owe; that’s more meaningful than leaving it with me.”

Chen Pingan put away the stamps, raised his wine bowl again, saying, “Those who sell wine often drink less, and those who buy wine usually have poor tolerance. Why buy wine, then? Isn’t that the logic, Uncle Tao?”

Tao Wen laughed. “I don’t argue with scholars. You drink your wine, and I’ll drink mine. Trying to persuade someone to drink at the table only harms their character.”

They both drained their final bowls of wine.

Chen Pingan stood up, smiling and cupping his fists. “Next time we drink, I don’t know when that will be.”

Tao Wen waved his hand. “Drinking with me is the least exciting; that’s a given. It’s fine if you don’t drink. I won’t see you off.”

Chen Pingan left the house, walking alone in the alley.

He held the two stamps tightly.

“Seeking to get drunk, but not to be drunk.”

“Floral greens abundant.”

As Chen Pingan walked, he suddenly fell into a daze, as if walking through the muddy bottle alley of his hometown.

In the world, how did Tao Wen miss his wife and daughter so much?

Would his own parents, no longer in this world, also miss little Pingan in the same way?

Chen Pingan halted, lost in thought, before continuing on.

Moments later, Tao Wen appeared at the door, smiling and asking, “I still won’t take the stamps, but I want to know what’s engraved on those two stamps.”

Chen Pingan didn’t turn around, shaking his head. “Uncle Tao, it’s nothing. Just some words copied from books.”

Tao Wen chuckled. “You, this scholar.”

The young man in the green shirt, adorned with a hairpin, seemed rather unremarkable.

This didn’t quite fit the image of the second shopkeeper.

Tao Wen leaned against the door, standing there, gazing at the empty house.

The words in the book can make one’s eyes sting, and the wine in the bowl can be spicy to the stomach.

It seems they could indeed make one shed tears.

Then it could be said that it made sense.

The young man’s figure gradually walked further down the alley.

Swordsman Tao Wen sat on the threshold, facing the distant table inside, murmuring, “That time, father arrived late again, making you both wait for so many years. Green onions, green onions, it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t hurt. Father is doing well here; he can eat spring noodles and drink wine with good people. You both don’t need to worry…” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 717: Afraid It’s All Just a Dream

Chen Ping'an and Cui Dongshan, teacher and student in a foreign land, walked together toward a tavern that felt like half a home in this strange place.

Cui Dongshan quietly asked, “Did the teacher not manage to persuade him? Tao Wen still refuses to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, insisting on dying here?”

Just as rice nourishes a hundred different people, if there were sword cultivators like Cui Wei who did not want to die at the Sword Qi Great Wall, there would also be sword immortals like Tao Wen, who longed for home. Historically, there had been many from both sides in the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Among the top-tier old sword immortals and great sword immortals, whether they were alive or had already perished in battle, why was it that everyone sincerely wished for the teachings of the three schools and numerous philosophies to take root and flourish at the Sword Qi Great Wall? There were certainly reasons for that, and it was definitely not as simple as looking down on these teachings. The Sword Qi Great Wall’s answer was, in fact, much simpler and singular: the more knowledge one had, the more thoughts one entertained; the more complicated the human heart became. For sword cultivators, mastering the sword became increasingly difficult, and it was impossible for the Sword Qi Great Wall to endure for ten thousand years.

As for this matter, the ordinary local sword immortals were actually quite ignorant. Many years ago, on the battlements of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the oldest sword immortal, Chen Qingdu, had once personally presided over a gathering of saints for a projection, which did not end well. Afterward, the saints and sages from the Rites and Lesser Sage lineages who visited the Sword Qi Great Wall were given the academy’s directives, or rather strict orders, to supervise military affairs during their stay. During this time, there were those who, despite the risk of punishment, acted on their own volition in hopes of doing more for the Sword Qi Great Wall. The sword immortals did not deliberately suppress them, but in the end, nearly all these Confucian students became disheartened.

Chen Ping'an replied, “Once we’re at the table, if we’re busy drinking, there’s no persuading to be done. It turns out drinking really does get in the way of things.”

Chen Ping'an walked at a leisurely pace, with Cui Dongshan showing no urgency either. Thus, the two of them strolled slowly, not rushing to the table for fresh wine.

In the back alleys, numerous stories with unhappy endings were hidden away.

Cui Dongshan consoled him, “Now that the seal has been sent out, the teacher will feel somewhat better. But not sending it out might actually be better for Tao Wen, as he would feel better. Why must the teacher go to such lengths?”

Chen Ping'an changed the subject, asking, “How did your chess game with Lin Junbi turn out?”

Cui Dongshan shook his sleeves, and waves rippled beside them, like clusters of pale golden lotus flowers blooming and fading. However, due to Cui Dongshan’s unique illusion technique, one had to see these flowers first—something that no sword immortal in the fifth realm should even think about—before they could eavesdrop on the exchanges between the two sides. But merely seeing the flowers would break the formation, exposing some clues, which Cui Dongshan could then use to return the courtesy, asking that sword immortal if they knew who he was. If they didn’t, he would have to introduce himself.

The bait was who Cui Dongshan truly was, what would happen to Lin Junbi, and whether the trajectory of the Shao Yuan Dynasty would undergo earth-shattering changes. This would serve as proof to confirm Cui Dongshan's identity. 

After all, willing fish would take the bait.

Cui Dongshan wasn’t begging anyone to take the bait. The example of the great sword immortal, Yue Qing, had already been set. If he still wouldn’t give up and wanted to weigh the incense weight of the Confucian lineage, he should not blame Cui Dongshan for calling for reinforcements and asking his grandmaster to back him up.

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Lin Junbi is a clever man, but he’s still young and inexperienced, and his skin is thin. Of course, I'm a bit smarter than him. It wouldn’t be hard to completely ruin his Dao heart, just a simple matter. However, there’s no need for that. After all, I have no life-and-death enmity with him. The real grudge lies with that Mr. Xi Lu, who wrote the ‘Guide to Chess at the Happy Pavilion.’ How ridiculous! His chess skills are so poor, yet he dares to write a book to teach others how to play. It’s said that the sales of the chess manual are doing quite well, almost better than the ‘Cloud Patterns Manual’ in the Shao Yuan Dynasty. Can I endure that? Of course not! This is a genuine hindrance to my ability to make money. Cutting off someone’s means of making a living is quite a grudge, don’t you think?”

Chen Ping'an was puzzled, “What do you mean, cutting off your means of making a living?”

Cui Dongshan blushed slightly, “Putting aside special circumstances, generally speaking, every time the ‘Cloud Patterns Manual’ sells in the world of Haoran, I get a share of the profits. However, the White Emperor City has never mentioned this, and they have never proactively raised such a request. It’s something the merchants on the mountain figured out among themselves, for stability’s sake. Otherwise, making money could cost one’s life, which is not worth it. Of course, I did give some hints, worried that the city lord of White Emperor City would be magnanimous, but those around him have small hearts. If one is not careful, the person who publishes the chess manual might face retribution from White Emperor City. People of the demonic path are unpredictable in temperament; it’s always wise to be cautious. Moreover, being able to honestly send money to White Emperor City is a rare opportunity for incense.”

Chen Ping'an was at a loss for words. Had Cui Dongshan not mentioned it, he wouldn’t have known about such a long-term, subtle way to make big money. He laughed wryly, “When we drink later, you’re paying. If you’re this heartless in making money, you should drink a few more jars of Bamboo Sea Cave Wine to cleanse your heart.”

Cui Dongshan nodded in agreement, saying that the wine was too cheap and the spring noodles too delicious. The teacher was too kind in business. He continued, “And then there’s Lin Junbi’s preaching master, the national teacher of the Shao Yuan Dynasty. But many grievances from the older generation shouldn’t be passed down to the disciples. What others think has never mattered. What’s important is whether we, from the Confucian lineage, can maintain this thankless understanding. In this matter, Pei Qian doesn’t need much teaching; instead, Cao Qinglang needs to observe more situations and speak more principles.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, “So how did Lin Junbi fare?”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “So Lin Junbi was persuaded by my earnest advice and had an epiphany. He willingly became my pawn, his Dao heart strengthened even further. You can rest easy, teacher; I haven’t altered his Dao heart in the slightest. I’m merely assisting him in becoming the national teacher of the Shao Yuan Dynasty faster, becoming the first person beside the king, surpassing his master. It’s not just in terms of Dao lineage knowledge but also in secular power. Lin Junbi can acquire more than his master. What I’m doing is simply icing on the cake. Lin Junbi bears the fortune of the entire Shao Yuan Dynasty; he is qualified to think this way. The crux of the problem lies not in what I said or did, but in Lin Junbi’s preacher, who mistakenly believes that year after year of gentle guidance can turn Lin Junbi into another self, ultimately growing to become the stabilizing force for the Shao Yuan Dynasty. Little do they know, Lin Junbi has high aspirations and does not want to be anyone’s shadow. Thus, I seized the opportunity—Lin Junbi gets what he wants, I get my small benefits, and everyone is happy. Ultimately, it’s because Lin Junbi is clever enough that I’m willing to teach him genuine chess skills and how to conduct himself.”

At this point, Cui Dongshan remarked, “The teacher shouldn’t dwell on such matters. Don’t let these irrelevant issues affect your mood for drinking.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “The teacher’s matters are the student’s matters. The student’s matters shouldn’t be unrelated to the teacher.”

Cui Dongshan raised his sleeves as if to feign a handful of bitter tears. Chen Ping'an laughed, “Spare me the flattery. Just remember to buy a few more jars of wine later.”

Then Chen Ping'an reminded him, “Lady Yu Jian is quite good. Don’t deceive her.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “To her and the Yu family, it might not seem like much of a good thing, but at the very least, it’s not a bad thing. My relationship with that old man Yu, who is better at regretting moves than at chess, has never been bad. Teacher, rest assured, I know how to conduct myself in my current affairs. For Yu Jian to become the person you think is ‘not bad’ today, it’s certainly due to her own efforts and the subtle influence of her family background. As for the literary atmosphere of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, it’s pretty much the same reasoning. When picking pigs, one must look at the pigpen. Just be careful not to focus on exceptions, but rather observe the majority. The reasoning will not be wrong.”

Chen Ping'an fell silent for a moment, turning to look at the “big white goose” in his master disciple’s mouth. He smiled knowingly at Cao Qinglang, saying, “With a student like you around, I feel quite at ease.”

Cui Dongshan lamented, “It’s a pity I can’t always be by the teacher’s side, unable to help alleviate your small worries.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “As for Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang, whether in mindset or cultivation, you, as the elder disciple, should pay more attention to them. The capable should take on more work. Even if you feel wronged, I will pretend not to know.”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “In this world, there’s only one’s heart that isn’t cultivated enough. Upon deeper reflection, there really isn’t any grievance that can be considered a grievance.”

Chen Ping'an turned his head, “Are you teaching the teacher how to be a person?”

Cui Dongshan complained, “I’m deeply wronged!”

Chen Ping'an said, “Those who can read people’s hearts, the closer they are to the heavenly heart, the easier they are to be calculated by heaven. You must be more careful. Take care of yourself first, so you can look after others for a long time.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “The student has his own calculations and will consider accordingly.”

In truth, both parties had unspoken meanings in their final exchanges.

For the Confucian lineage, taking care of oneself certainly presupposed not harming others or disrupting the world. However, such words were difficult to express on Cui Dongshan’s side. Chen Ping'an didn’t wish to impose his own moral compass on others with great principles he himself had yet to fully comprehend.

Cui Dongshan’s response also did not agree with the teacher, as he could not guarantee “taking care of oneself,” let alone “for a long time.”

In this world, reasoning with others always carried some cost, large or small.

Thus, the cost of protecting the reasoning, whether to talk or not talk, would only be greater. For instance, Cui Dongshan temporarily set aside many important matters on Baoping Island to head to the Upside Down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, which required a price to pay. In fact, Cui Zhan had said nothing, nor had he negotiated; the letter only stated four words: “Go quickly and return quickly,” which could be considered an agreement to Cui Dongshan’s idleness. But Cui Dongshan knew well that he was willing to do more. Since you, Cui Zhan, could let me off the hook, then I, Cui Dongshan, will not be like you, Cui Zhan, and will choose to go the extra mile.

Cui Dongshan understood what his teacher was doing at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Not only that, but he could also bring along that Qi Jinglong from the Taihui Sword Sect.

Cui Dongshan would only engage in interesting, meaningful activities that could also yield profits. Hence, he could only ally himself with clever people like Lin Junbi and could never become comrades with people like Qi Jinglong and Zhong Kui.

His teacher was not like this.

His teacher was not like this. If the student could not persuade him, then there was no need to persuade him.

Because the teacher was the teacher.

Many disciples in the world always thought they could gain something from their teacher—knowledge, reputation, protection of the Dao, opportunities, money.

Cui Dongshan was too lazy to discuss the merits or demerits of such things. After all, he was not one of them. It had nothing to do with him, so he hung it high outside the door.

When they arrived at the tavern, it was packed with people. Chen Ping'an took Cui Dongshan to grab two jars of wine and squatted by the roadside, surrounded by many unfamiliar sword cultivators.

Cui Dongshan’s reputation at the Sword Qi Great Wall had grown significantly. His chess skills were high, and it was said that he had won many games against Lin Junbi, with one game lasting over four hundred moves.

Some local sword immortals who were well-versed in chess remarked that this third-generation disciple of the Confucian lineage, Cui Dongshan, was unparalleled in chess skills and surely had no rivals at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As a result, the various gamblers and drunks felt much better, thinking that the second tavern keeper, serving as Cui Dongshan’s master, must surely have superior chess skills. Thus, being fooled by the second tavern keeper in a bet didn’t seem too embarrassing. At the same time, many realized they had wronged the second tavern keeper; although his character in gambling and drinking was indeed questionable, there was no doubt about his chess character. Despite his high skills, he had never flaunted them in this regard, maintaining a shred of conscience that hadn’t been completely taken by the dogs of the Haoran world.

Now that the tavern was doing exceptionally well, the head tavern keeper, Diezhang, planned to buy the two adjacent shops. Initially, he was worried about overstepping and prepared himself to be scolded, so he cautiously mentioned his thoughts to the second tavern keeper. To his surprise, the second tavern keeper nodded in agreement, making Diezhang feel he had a bit of insight in doing business. 

With this plan in mind, Diezhang discussed it with the short-term worker, Zhang Jiazheng. The young man agreed to work at the tavern full-time from then on. Besides Zhang Jiazheng from Lingxi Alley, a peer named Jiang Qu from Suili Alley also proactively approached Diezhang, hoping to find work at the tavern. He mentioned he didn’t want any wages, just enough food to fill his stomach. Of course, Diezhang did not agree, saying wages would be paid, but initially, it wouldn’t be much. If the business improved, he would increase it later. Thus, Jiang Qu often found Zhang Jiazheng lately, inquiring about various tasks at the tavern. Zhang Jiazheng, who was already familiar with his peer, shared everything with him, further strengthening their bond as they came from different poor alleys but had similar backgrounds.

After drinking, they returned to Ningfu. On the way back, Cui Dongshan carried two jars of Qingshen Mountain wine, costing five snowflake coins a jar. He certainly wouldn’t owe any debts to the tavern.

The sight of those drunks made their scalps tingle and hearts chill. Did the second tavern keeper even cheat his own student? If he could cheat outsiders, would he show mercy?

It was said that at the Sword Qi Great Wall, there was a self-proclaimed master of gambling, a Nascent Soul sword cultivator who hadn’t lost a single coin to A Liang, who was already starting to research how to bet and profit from the second tavern keeper. When the time came, he would compile these findings into a book and distribute it freely. Anyone drinking at the largest tavern in the Sword Qi Great Wall could casually take a copy. It seemed that the Baoguang Tavern, under the Qi family, was openly competing with the second tavern keeper.

When Nalan Yexing opened the door, he was pleasantly surprised to receive two jars of wine. He inadvertently called out, “Dongshan, little brother!” Cui Dongshan smiled and called back, “Nalan, grandpa!” Thinking that this old brother Nalan had really aged and forgotten his lessons, it was time for a good reprimanding. His previous words were merely to slightly annoy Bai Momo; this time, he would certainly hit Nalan hard—“to hit is to care, to scold is to love.” Accept it well and behave.

To prevent Nalan Yexing from having the chance to make amends, as soon as Cui Dongshan and his teacher crossed the threshold of Ningfu, he chuckled softly, “Thanks to that sister Luoshan for personally escorting you.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “It’s part of her duty; no need to think too much about it.”

Cui Dongshan shook his sleeves, “Of course. I’m just a bit anxious; I wonder if today’s attire will be to Sister Luoshan’s liking.”

Nalan Yexing laughed, “Dongshan, you’re a rare and charming young man. The sword immortal Luoshan will surely remember you.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Yes, yes.”

At the martial arts arena, Pei Qian was being fed punches by Bai Momo.

Chen Ping'an couldn't bear to watch. When it came to his own practice, no matter how badly he was fed punches by a tenth realm martial artist, it was nothing. However, he simply could not stand seeing his disciple being treated that way.

The real reason was that Chen Ping'an feared that if he watched a few more times, if Pei Qian made a mistake later, he would be unable to bear to be harsh and would speak less on principles. After all, during those years at Shujian Lake, Chen Ping'an had already suffered enough from the hardships of his own mental journey.

Severing ties with others was difficult but not impossible. The hardest part was severing ties with yesterday’s self; that was a thousand times harder, akin to ascending to the heavens.

At the summer palace outside the city of the Hidden Official.

The Hidden Official stood on a chair, gripping her two braids. The chair hovered in midair as she looked down, her vision encompassing a city map that was both vast and detailed. Even the private gardens and pavilions within the grand residences along Tai Xiang Street could be viewed in their entirety.

However, on the map now, there were routes drawn in red ink, vibrant crimson lines connecting a point in Ningfu to various unmarked endpoints—most notably the tavern of Diezhang, as well as the spot where the storyteller’s stool was placed at a street corner, and then the training grounds on either side of the Sword Qi Great Wall, along with a few other scattered markings. In short, wherever the second tavern keeper went, there would be a mark on the map.

Pang Yuanji once asked, “Why does the master care so much about Chen Ping'an’s route? He isn’t a spy from the妖族.”

The Hidden Official replied, “It’s boring if there’s no wine to drink or fights to be had.”

Pang Yuanji stopped asking, for that reasoning made sense.

According to his master, the Hidden Official lineage had reached a point in its history at the Sword Qi Great Wall under her stewardship. Even if her performance wasn’t top-notch, she was definitely qualified. Not only that, but she had also done so much extra work; her contributions were not small. It was truly unfair that the old sword immortal still found fault with her; it was a case of bullying someone who had already overburdened themselves.

The sword immortal Luoshan, still wearing a round-collared brocade robe, had merely changed its color; the style remained the same, and she still adorned her hair with flowers.

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, Luoshan of the Hidden Official lineage and the madwoman swinging on the battlements, Zhou Cheng, were both stunning figures.

Upon entering the grand hall of the summer palace, Luoshan drew another crimson line on the map.

The Bamboo Hermit Sword Immortal frowned, “Why did you bring Cui Dongshan to Tao Wen’s residence? What’s your intention?”

Luoshan replied, “You’re asking me? Should I ask Chen Ping'an or that Cui Dongshan?”

The Bamboo Hermit Sword Immortal responded, “If you want to go, then go ahead. I won’t stop you.”

Luoshan shot him a glare.

The Bamboo Hermit was completely unaware.

The Hidden Official spoke up, “Perhaps he is trying to persuade Tao Wen to earn more money and not seek death. This second tavern keeper is still too soft-hearted; no wonder I took a dislike to him at first glance.”

The Hidden Official twisted her braids, pouting, “Our second tavern keeper probably hasn’t seen enough of the world. If he had spent more time observing, and if he could keep this heart of his after seeing enough, I would truly admire him. Unfortunately…”

Unfortunately, the Hidden Official did not continue, and Luoshan and the Bamboo Hermit Sword Immortal wouldn’t ask further.

Suddenly, the Hidden Official sighed, looking even more regretful, “It’s no fun that Yue Qing wasn’t killed.”

The Bamboo Hermit Sword Immortal was genuinely curious this time. After all, a tenth realm martial artist like Chen Ping'an didn’t pique his interest, but being a sword cultivator, he was highly interested. He asked, “Hidden Official, what did the old sword immortal say that could make them stop their swords?”

The Hidden Official extended her hand.

The Bamboo Hermit Sword Immortal tossed over a jar of heavenly brew from Baoguang Tavern.

The Hidden Official tucked it into her sleeve, saying, “It was probably something like, ‘Your junior disciples are watching; you’ve drawn so many swords and still haven’t killed anyone. That’s already embarrassing enough. It’s better to not kill Yue Qing; let it be considered a sword technique spar. If he were to die, it’d be too shameful for this grandmaster.’”

Luoshan and the Bamboo Hermit Sword Immortal exchanged glances, finding this answer difficult to believe.

The Hidden Official jumped onto the armrest of the chair, standing tall to look down at the map, murmuring to herself, “There are too many people about to die. The living ones aren’t too few either. Is there such a business as winning and losing money, earning and paying back? In the future, who will remember that little bit of life-and-death money for you, Tao Wen? Or the trivial matters done by you, Chen Ping'an? Under the great trend, no one can escape; these meaningless matters are done with such enthusiasm? Alas, I really don’t understand what these sword cultivators who have read books are thinking. It’s always been like this. I can’t drink either; it’s killing me. Bamboo Hermit, hurry and drink, so I can at least catch a whiff of the wine.”

Today at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The Left and Right were not merely uncomfortable but extremely so.

Toward Cui Dongshan, they were straightforward; if they didn’t like him, they would draw their swords.

Toward Chen Ping'an, they would teach him some of their academic methods. If there were any displeasing aspects, they would just have the junior disciple practice swordsmanship.

But both of these were disciples!

Plus, there was that Guo Zhujiu, who for some reason had been brought along by the junior disciple; he counted as half a disciple?

Pei Qian decided it was time to speak up. Losing to Cao Qinglang once was bad luck, but losing twice meant she was lacking in etiquette toward her grandmaster!

So, as soon as her master and grandmaster finished their small talk, she was going to step in!

To her surprise, Pei Qian had calculated everything, yet she overlooked the half-baked fellow disciple, Guo Zhujiu.

This fellow, for some unknown reason, had been released from confinement and had frequently been running to Ningfu lately, disturbing her master during her closed-door training. The key issue was that Guo Zhujiu had no good words regarding her senior sister.

Just because the senior sister didn’t recognize this little junior sister didn’t mean that it was the little junior sister’s reason for not recognizing her senior sister, right? Huh? Want a taste of my fist?

Forget it, forget it. Remember the master’s teachings: the sword is high in the sheath, and the fist should not be thrown.

Guo Zhujiu spoke up first today, “In the future, grandmaster, with just one person and one sword, you surrounded so many sword immortals, including the great sword immortal Yue Qing. Aren’t you feeling quite indifferent, right? Because in that earlier battle against the demons outside the city, you alone surrounded so many great demons, cutting them down like chopping vegetables, so you’re quite used to it, I’m sure! Grandmaster, don’t deny it!”

The Left smiled, “I can admit that.”

Guo Zhujiu said earnestly, “If I were a wild person from the barren world, I would burn incense and pray, hoping grandmaster’s sword skills wouldn’t rise even a bit more.”

Pei Qian’s face turned red with agitation, scratching her head.

This flattery was too insincere.

Grandmaster, please don’t believe it.

The Left smiled, saying polite things to both Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang, behaving quite like an elder, praising Pei Qian’s mad sword techniques and encouraging her to keep it up, saying that the ancestral sword intent of the sword immortal Zhou Cheng could be learned, but there was no need for reverence. The grandmaster would personally teach her sword techniques later.

The Left also instructed Cao Qinglang to diligently study, emphasizing that balancing both cultivation and academic pursuits was the foundation of the Confucian lineage. He reminded Cao Qinglang’s teacher to not just rely on learning from Chen Ping'an, as that was far from enough. He must surpass his predecessors; this was the essence of being a Confucian disciple. Otherwise, if every generation fell short of the previous one, wouldn’t that make the ancestors laugh? Other lineages don’t need to be mentioned, but the Confucian lineage absolutely does not follow this principle.

Seeing this, Chen Ping'an felt both pleased and uncomfortable.

He had never seen this senior brother so amiable and easy to talk to on his side.

Could this be what they call generational affection?

After leading them to meet their grandmaster, the old sword immortal’s thatched hut was not far away.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment but then brought them along to see the old man.

Chen Qingdu stepped out of his hut and glared at Cui Dongshan, as if saying, “Get lost, you little brat.”

Cui Dongshan smiled, saying, “Sure thing.” 

With a turn, he bounced away, his two white sleeves flaring up.

Guo Zhujiu stood still, extending two fingers and mimicking walking with her feet.

The old sword immortal glanced at her again, and to show sincerity, Guo Zhujiu’s two fingers began to walk a bit faster.

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “You’re not being let go.”

Guo Zhujiu, feeling relieved, spun around, standing still to indicate she had gone and returned.

Pei Qian sighed internally, thinking she really should advise her master. This sort of dim-witted girl shouldn’t be led into the sect. Even if she had to accept a disciple, this girl, who grew tall but didn’t grow her brain, would have to sit near the door in the ancestral hall of Luopo Mountain.

As Chen Ping'an’s first disciple, Pei Qian was selfless, absolutely not mixing personal grievances into it, purely having the greater good of the sect in mind.

Pei Qian couldn’t help but admire Guo Zhujiu. Being silly was a good thing; she dared to be so reckless in front of the old sword immortal.

As for herself, she absolutely wouldn’t dare to speak or even glance at the old sword immortal; her eyes would hurt.

Chen Qingdu looked at the children beside Chen Ping'an, finally saying to him, “Do you have an answer now?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Disciples of the Confucian lineage always have their principles of what to do and what not to do.”

Chen Qingdu nodded, simply saying, “As you wish.”

By the end of this day at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Left sat in the middle, with Chen Ping'an and Pei Qian seated on either side. Chen Ping'an had Guo Zhujiu beside him while Pei Qian had Cao Qinglang next to her.

Cui Dongshan, for reasons unknown, had previously been chased away by the old sword immortal but was then called back.

After discussing matters, Cui Dongshan, with both hands tucked into his sleeves, casually stood side by side with Chen Qingdu, as if the old sword immortal didn’t mind. The two gazed toward the distant scenery together.

Chen Qingdu smiled and asked, “National Teacher, what are your thoughts?”

Cui Dongshan replied lightly, “Afraid it’s all just a dream.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 718: Swordsmanship of the Left and Right**

Chen Ping'an was once again summoned by the Grandmaster Swordsman. 

On the city wall, there was only one elder from the Confucian Sage lineage: Left and Right. He wasn't some innate sword embryo and had started practicing swordsmanship later than most, yet he eventually became the highest authority in the sword arts of the Haoran world.

Pei Qian, a peak warrior of the Four Realms, had been pummeled by Bai Lianshuang, a Nine Realms warrior, multiple times in Ningfu. This encounter had loosened the bottleneck she faced. During a private conversation Chen Ping'an had with Cui Dongshan, aside from discussing the booklet matter, they also considered Pei Qian's breakthrough. Should they follow Chen Ping'an's original plan and leave the Sword Qi Great Wall after admiring its magnificent scenery, or should they make slight modifications to allow her to stay behind with Mr. Zhong at the Sword Qi Great Wall for a while longer? Chen Ping'an leaned towards the former, as he had no idea when the next great battle would begin, but Cui Dongshan suggested waiting until Pei Qian reached the Five Realms before they departed. Moreover, Mr. Zhong had a broad mindset and was exceptionally talented in martial arts. Staying an extra day at the Sword Qi Great Wall would yield apparent benefits for Pei Qian's martial physique. Thus, as long as they didn't stay at the Sword Qi Great Wall for more than half a year, it wouldn't be too much of a problem.

Yet, Chen Ping'an still felt a bit uneasy. However, with Cui Dongshan by his side, that unease became merely a lingering worry.

Cao Qinglang, a cultivator at the bottleneck of the Cave Dwelling Realm, was also not a sword cultivator. In fact, whether in background, academic journey, or scholarly lineage, he had similarities with Left and Right. His cultivation of body, mind, and Dao was neither hurried nor anxious.

Guo Zhujiu, the only daughter of the sword immortal Guo Jia, was a sword cultivator at the Sea Observation Realm with exceptional talent. If not for being confined by her family, she would have been the one to guard the first gate against Lin Junbi, who excelled at hiding his strengths. Despite being a remarkable innate sword embryo and having taken on a master, she was determined to learn fist techniques, specifically the kind that could unleash thunderous power with a single blow.

Left and Right spoke, "Pei Qian, do you know what the shortcomings of your self-created sword technique are?"

Pei Qian wore a mournful expression. How could she have anticipated that her grandmaster would focus on her chaotic sword technique? This was just a joke; it wasn't worth discussing! What shortcomings could there be? This technique has no strengths at all! What do you want me to say, Grandmaster? I was just messing around with people, talking about seeds and boasting; I didn’t even dare to show off much at the Sword Qi Great Wall. How could the Grandmaster take it seriously?

Guo Zhujiu leaned back, glancing at the back of Pei Qian's head. The petite senior sister was timid, stunned in the presence of the Grandmaster Swordsman and too intimidated to speak. At the moment, as a half-disciple of her master, she felt she needed to step up and take on some responsibility to make up for her senior sister’s shortcomings.

Left and Right didn’t mind Pei Qian’s timidity and said, "Has anyone ever told you that your swordsmanship is too mixed and chaotic? And that while you can unleash it freely, you struggle to rein it in?"

Pei Qian braced herself and murmured, "No, Grandmaster. No one has spoken of my sword technique, good or bad."

At this point, Pei Qian’s voice grew softer, "Only that swinging sword immortal, Sister Zhou, said something I didn’t understand. When we first met, she gave me a gift, and I couldn’t even stop her. After my master found out, he insisted that before I leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, I must properly thank Sword Immortal Zhou and guarantee that I would learn that sword intent, although I can’t promise how well I’ll learn it. But I will put my heart into it."

Left and Right wasn’t concerned about the entangled sword intent that Sister Zhou from the Zhou Clan had given to Pei Qian. Since Chen Ping'an had already taught her the proper etiquette, there was no need for further elaboration. He merely stated, "Your master has praised your sword technique highly in my presence, not just once. He even said among his disciples, ‘When it comes to swordsmanship, Pei Qian resembles the eldest senior brother the most.’ So, as your grandmaster, I’ve been quite curious."

Pei Qian lowered her head, feeling she had let her master down, "I’ve disappointed you, Grandmaster."

Left and Right laughed, "It’s fortunate no one dares to say those absurd things to you. Too mixed? Can’t rein it in? Otherwise, as your grandmaster, I would have to speak up for you."

He pointed into the distance, "Pei Qian."

Pei Qian looked up in the direction he indicated.

Cao Qinglang and Guo Zhujiu also raised their gazes but couldn’t see clearly. Comparatively, Guo Zhujiu was able to see more due not just to her higher realm than Cao Qinglang, but also because she was a sword cultivator.

Sometimes, as an innate sword cultivator, one indeed had the right to look down on the world of Qi practitioners.

It was a pity that here, at the Sword Qi Great Wall, had it been in the rarefied Haoran world, a prodigious innate sword embryo like Guo Zhujiu would have been a distinguished disciple in any sect, someone a sect would gladly invest countless resources in to cultivate.

Yet, Pei Qian, who wasn’t even considered a Qi practitioner, could see more clearly than the sword cultivator Guo Zhujiu. Outside the city walls, in the sky between heaven and earth, strands of chaotic sword energy suddenly appeared, floating and shifting erratically, twisting at will, their paths crooked and devoid of any order. In fact, about fifty to sixty percent of the sword energy seemed to be fighting each other. It was as if the Grandmaster had encountered a roaming beast from the wild world, treating it like a fish swimming in water. The Grandmaster casually threw out a vast fishing net, yet this fishing net itself lacked finesse, making it very difficult for Pei Qian to comprehend.

To accommodate Pei Qian’s vision, Left and Right raised one hand and lightly pinched a sword formula. The scattered strands of sword energy in the distance condensed into a fist-sized ball.

Left and Right said, "This little thing, when smashed onto a Nascent Soul, is enough to obliterate both their spirit and soul. Your swordsmanship should aspire to reach this level. It’s not that it’s too mixed; rather, it isn’t mixed enough, far from it. As long as your sword energy is abundant enough, so abundant that it defies reason, that’s all you need. Ordinary sword cultivators shouldn't even think about this. As your grandmaster, I wouldn’t offer such guidance lightly. Each person is different, and this swordsmanship is precisely suitable for you. When facing an enemy, it’s not about reasoning or debating; what rules are there? If you want someone dead, just crush them. With enough sword energy, if your opponent wants to strike back? They’ll have to see if your sword energy allows it!"

Left and Right’s fingers moved, splitting the white ball of sword energy into two. A fine line shot forth, bursting with dazzling light, eventually exploding like a spring thunderclap, scattering away, the fierce wind swirling around. Countless "innocent" strands of sword energy were churned to pieces. Then, day after day, year after year, they would regroup, and with good fortune, could be drawn by the residual will of ancient sword immortals, nurtured until they could produce refined sword intent similar to that of Sword Immortal Zhou, akin to being reborn. The sword immortal had perished for centuries, yet their intent could live on.

Left and Right slowly continued, "This is the next level you should pursue once your sword energy matures. Even if I possess the strength of ten thousand, I can kill with just a hair’s worth of power — I would still do so."

Pei Qian cautiously asked, "Grandmaster, can I choose not to kill?"

Left and Right replied, "For those who cannot be killed, even the highest swordsmanship is not a reason for you to wield your sword. For those who can be killed or spared, it’s up to you. But remember, those who ought to be killed must not be spared. Just because your realm has risen doesn’t mean you should assume you’re bullying the weak. Don’t think you can treat it lightly and laugh it off. It’s far from that. The weak around you, in other parts of the Haoran world, are absolute powerhouses. The harm they can bring to the world is far greater than that of ordinary people. As you traverse more of the martial world, seeing more of the people on the mountains, you will understand this. If these people have inadvertently found themselves on your sword's edge, and your reasoning is sound, and your swordsmanship is high, then don’t hesitate."

Pei Qian hesitated, words caught in her throat.

Left and Right said, "The Confucian Sage lineage, when discussing swordsmanship, is of course not enough. The reasoning in your heart is only for your own peace of mind; it’s far from sufficient. No matter how high your swordsmanship, what does it matter?"

Left and Right turned and called out, "Cao Qinglang."

Cao Qinglang immediately understood, saying, "Grandmaster, while it seems you’re discussing swordsmanship, you’re actually connecting it to principles. The intertwining of thoughts can either lead to conflict or unite like your ball of sword energy in the end, gathering those who are on similar paths. This is similar to how a person's knowledge is formed. In studying, one must strive against the writings and principles of sages, but more importantly, one must contend with their own heart, and measure against the world and the heavens. Ultimately, those who can still succeed amidst it all are the ones who stand tall, who can uphold the essence of unparalleled knowledge."

Left and Right was very pleased, nodding, "Indeed, you resemble me closely. Hence, I need not say much to you. Can you understand?"

Cao Qinglang smiled and nodded.

Left and Right turned to Pei Qian, "What I’ve said today should mean you need to listen less to what those sword principles say, right?"

Pei Qian recalled her master's teachings about being sincere with others and mustered the courage to respond, "A sour mood is a sour mood, but learning swordsmanship is a different matter; they don’t conflict."

Left and Right nodded, "Very good, it should be like that. While coming from the same master is indeed a connection, it doesn’t mean you all have to become one person, with one mindset. It’s not necessary for every student to resemble their master, nor for every disciple to become like their teacher. As long as you uphold the rules, your actions and words are free."

Left and Right glanced at Guo Zhujiu, who was the most spirited among them. At this moment, she was listening intently, her thoughts drifting over to her "master," trying to eavesdrop on the conversation between her master and the Grandmaster Swordsman. Naturally, she couldn’t hear much, but that didn’t stop her from trying.

Noticing the Grandmaster’s gaze, Guo Zhujiu quickly straightened up, adopting a serious posture, "Every word from the Grandmaster carries immense weight; I must take them seriously."

Pei Qian sighed, feeling that this girl truly lacked respect for her elders and was utterly reckless.

Left and Right addressed Guo Zhujiu, "Do you know what it means to learn fist techniques, acknowledge Chen Ping'an as your master, and record the falling treasures of the Haoran world?"

Guo Zhujiu shouted loudly, "Grandmaster! I don’t know!"

She spoke with great confidence.

Left and Right felt this was quite similar to his own past, and it was rather amusing.

However, in this moment, having changed identities and experiencing it firsthand, Left and Right realized that perhaps his own master never felt troubled by him.

Even Left and Right felt a bit of a headache. Forget it; let Chen Ping'an deal with it on his own.

But since the girl called him Grandmaster, he couldn’t let it be for nothing. Left and Right turned to Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan hurriedly approached the city wall, "Grandmaster, what teachings do you have?"

Left and Right replied, "For your master, casually take out a few treasures to gift to Guo Zhujiu. Don’t make it too shabby."

Guo Zhujiu quietly turned around, extending two fingers on one hand and three on the other. Whether it was a choice between two or a total of five gifts, who knows what she was thinking and why.

Cui Dongshan flipped his wrist, revealing a string of colorful treasures, the best in the world, and tossed it to Guo Zhujiu.

Guo Zhujiu caught the treasure string, astonished, "You’re really giving it? I was just casually asking for a lot, thinking I’d bargain with my little senior brother!"

Though she said that, her actions of putting the treasure on her wrist were smooth and without hesitation.

Cui Dongshan grinned, "This is called the Five Treasure String, made of molten gold and copper coins, the root of mountain clouds, infused with the essence of water from jade beads, and struck by lightning from peach wood cores. It’s a cherished item of a certain farmer immortal in the Haoran world. It’s just waiting for little junior sister to ask for it. My little junior brother has been waiting so long, he’s about to die from anxiety."

Guo Zhujiu secretly thought, "Once we leave the city wall, if the Grandmaster doesn’t see us, I’ll return it to you; just let me wear it for a bit."

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "No need; after all, my little junior brother is being generous on someone else's behalf. Quickly accept it; in case my little junior brother tells an old bastard that he lost it, it's a perfect excuse. My little junior brother shows off once, and my little junior sister benefits, leaving the old bastard heartbroken. It’s a win-win."

Guo Zhujiu was in a fog, shaking her wrist, the treasures sparkling and a bit heavy.

Such a precious gift would need to be discussed with her master before deciding whether to accept it.

Cui Dongshan had no shortage of treasures in his pockets.

But back when Cui Dongshan first arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had told the female disciple of the Master Sword Room that he was broke, borrowing the treasure ship of Liuxia Prefecture, and he hadn’t lied.

With the soul split in two, since the skin belonged to him, the nearby items and possessions logically should be returned to Cui Chuan.

Finally, Left and Right told Pei Qian, Cao Qinglang, and Guo Zhujiu, "Swordsmanship can be practiced often, but don’t easily grasp a real sword. This is something you should truly learn from your master. If you don’t even know what something is, how can you practice it?"

"The faster the people around you move, the less you should be anxious."

"I will have a talk with your father."

Chen Ping'an summoned his symbolic boat gifted by the old immortal Huan Yun, taking the three back to the city of Ningfu. Before doing so, the boat first skimmed over the southern city wall to see the large inscriptions carved there. One line spanned like a road of the world, one drooped like a waterfall, and a single point indicated that there were immortal caves where cultivators resided.

Cui Dongshan mentioned wanting to wander around for a bit longer.

Eventually, Cui Dongshan found the monk.

Sitting cross-legged, he said, "I owe two thanks. One for myself, and one for Baopingzhou."

The monk nodded, "The human heart sits alone towards the light, and when it speaks, it roars like a lion."

Cui Dongshan didn’t want to linger on personal matters and sincerely asked, "My grandfather ultimately rested in the Heart Reflection Temple of Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Before his passing, he seemed to want to ask the abbot about Buddhist teachings, but for some reason, he refrained. Could you clarify this for me?"

The monk replied, "That Master Cui likely wished to inquire whether such coincidences were destined or understood. Yet, as the words reached his lips, the thought arose and fell; he truly let go. Master Cui has let go; why can’t you? Today’s Cui Dongshan cannot let go; what of yesterday’s Master Cui? Did he truly let go?"

Cui Dongshan frowned, "There’s only one heaven and earth; increases and decreases are fixed. The river of time flows in one direction; it goes and does not return! My grandfather letting go means he has truly let go. How can his letting go change because of my own worries?"

The monk burst into laughter, saying, "Buddhism is limitless. Is it truly only about the sequence of events? Can it not accommodate one who cannot let go? What if one lets go? What if one does not?"

Cui Dongshan shook his head, "Don’t try to confuse me with words. Whether it’s the theories of famed scholars or the principles of Buddhism, I have delved deep into them."

The monk joined his hands in prayer, looking up at the sky, then returning his gaze to the vast land. He placed his right hand over his right knee, with his fingertips gently touching the ground.

Raising another hand, he entwined his thumb and index finger, while the rest of his fingers naturally spread out like a blooming lotus.

Cui Dongshan sighed, joined his hands in prayer, nodded as a sign of respect, and then turned to leave.

The monk’s expression was serene as he raised his hand that had touched the ground, extending his palm outward, fingers drooping, smiling, "Once again, I have seen the suffering sea of humanity, blooming a lotus."

Cui Dongshan leaped down from the southern wall, crossing the extremely wide horse-walk path, and stepping onto the northern wall. With a single step, he fell straight down, stirring up a bout of dust at the wall's base, then emerging from the yellow sand dressed in immaculate white robes. He dashed forward, skipping and jumping, occasionally soaring through the air.

Those who thought Cui Dongshan had lost his mind, like Zhu Mei, had ample reason. No one would ride a symbolic boat and wield a paddle. Neither would someone stroll through the city, sharing a light walking stick with a little girl in a quiet place while pretending to be exhausted.

Cui Dongshan didn’t head straight to Ningfu but instead sneakily climbed over a wall into a grand mansion.

He spotted a swordsman sitting in the corridor, sipping wine. Cui Dongshan squatted on the railing, fixated on the wine cup.

Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan smiled, "National Master, everything else is negotiable, but this item cannot be given to you."

Cui Dongshan complained, "You’re so stingy, Sword Immortal."

Sun Juyuan sighed with a bitter smile, "I truly cannot believe that the National Master is the National Master."

Cui Dongshan smirked, "Isn’t the Sword Qi Great Wall convinced you’re a spy? But in truth, you’re just a gambler helping others stake their bets and then sharing the spoils?"

Sun Juyuan pondered, "Many wish to learn from Ah Liang, but few can do so well. The sense of balance that a storyteller possesses, how does it come about? So many end up as a great joke. After all, everything Ah Liang does has a major premise — his swordsmanship and sword intent. How can outsiders learn from that? During those hundred years, how did the swordsman Ah Liang of the Haoran world become the Sword Qi Great Wall’s Ah Liang? You and I both know."

Cui Dongshan said, "I have a junior brother named Mao Xiaodong. He may not excel in studies, but he teaches well. My master learns quickly and well. Everything within sight can be cultivated."

Sun Juyuan waved his hand, "Don’t say such things; I really can’t handle it. Again, it’s junior brother Mao Xiaodong and Master Er Zhanggui. I don’t even dare to drink anymore."

Cui Dongshan raised his chin, clearly not willing to give up, "What’s the use of a wine cup if you don’t drink? Just give it to me."

Sun Juyuan looked at this young man squatting on the railing, feeling like he had a headache, resembling the bitter expression of the bitter melon swordsman.

Cui Dongshan leaped down from the railing, "Everyone is filled with grievances, yet they can’t do anything about an old swordsman. How do I alleviate my worries? I guess I can only drink. Getting drunk and waiting for death is better than being sober and having to face death."

Sun Juyuan didn’t hide his thoughts, "How you think and how you act are two different matters. Ah Liang once told me this principle. One speaks clearly, and the other listens well. Otherwise, had the swordsman who was killed by the Grandmaster not been the much-admired Dong Guanpu, he would have just been an inconsequential Sun Juyuan."

Cui Dongshan leaned back against the railing, "The couple of sword immortals at Ningfu died in battle, yet Dong Guanpu was killed by his own. When my master first arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was that kind of situation. Ningfu then fell from grace, while the Dong family remained glorious. No one dared to say a word; who do you think is most sorrowful?"

Sun Juyuan replied, "Naturally, it’s still the Grandmaster Swordsman."

Cui Dongshan folded his hands into his sleeves, "Everyone has their reasons, which can be quite troublesome."

Sun Juyuan chuckled, "National Master, you didn’t come here today just to complain, did you? Between you and me, the price is fair; it’s just business. Some matters have been entangled for too many years. No matter how great the Swordsman is, he doesn’t have the energy to sort it all out. The answer is simply, ‘What else can be done, but this is how it is.’ Besides, going out to slay monsters has become second nature. After engaging in battles for a long time, it feels like a natural thing to do. As for me, Sun Juyuan, I’d consider myself a timid person. Yet if it comes to the city wall and I head south, I would still get excited about killing."

Cui Dongshan remarked, "In the past, wars occurred roughly every hundred years. Ignoring the brutal slaughter after the thirteen-person battle, there have been two attacks on the city within just ten years since then, though neither was large in scale. They merely wanted to use war to feed war, to reconcile various power factions, to practice martial skills. Are you afraid? Once the battle strength of half the wild world gathers, even the entire wild world, with the Sword Qi Great Wall's limited forces and flying swords, would you be scared?"

Sun Juyuan replied, "That’s why we complain endlessly but ultimately don’t do much. After all, the Grandmaster Swordsman is guarding the city wall."

Cui Dongshan asked, "Then what if that long-lost sovereign of the wild world reappears? Someone who could match Chen Qingdu in a one-on-one fight? What will you swordsmen do? Will you still have the courage to descend from the wall?"

Sun Juyuan fell silent.

Cui Dongshan extended his hand, smiling, "How about a bet? If I’m wrong, this wine cup is mine. After all, it’s useless to you, and perhaps I can use it as a reason to seek some luck. If nothing happens, I’ll definitely return it to you later; sword immortals have a long life and aren’t afraid of waiting."

Sun Juyuan tossed the wine cup to Cui Dongshan, "Regardless of win or lose, this is for you. Ah Liang once said that no gambler from the Sword Qi Great Wall could win. The more of a swordsman you are, the more so. Rather than lose to those beasts from the wild world, leave some luck for the Haoran world. It’s like choosing the lesser evil; they’re both unpleasant, but at least you won’t hurt yourself too much."

Cui Dongshan laughed as he caught the cup, "But?"

Sun Juyuan nodded, standing up, "There’s indeed a ‘but.’ ‘Have I promised to cross over the wall?’"

Cui Dongshan nodded, "I almost couldn’t help myself and was about to return the wine cup to you, making a brotherly bond and slashing a chicken's head to burn yellow paper."

Sun Juyuan chuckled, "When the National Master speaks like this, it really dampens my spirits. My rare display of heroism is about to collapse."

Cui Dongshan quipped, "Sword Immortal Sun, if you continue being so emotional, I might have to use the Laopo Mountain's methods to deal with you!"

Sun Juyuan suddenly became serious, "You aren’t that embroidered tiger; you’re not the National Master."

Cui Dongshan replied, "I’m Dongshan!"

Sun Juyuan smirked, finally unable to hold back, "Then I’m still from the West River!"

As that white-clad figure leaped over the wall, tumbling to the other side, he muttered, "So overbearing! The sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall bully people, with words that wound the heart…"

Lin Junbi hadn’t practiced swordplay on the city wall recently; instead, she was focused on composing music alone.

The pride of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, including Yan Lü, dared not disturb Lin Junbi’s meditative state whenever they returned to the Sun residence.

Only Yan Lü had visited the dispirited Lin Junbi once. Yet upon seeing Yan Lü, Lin Junbi appeared more enthusiastic than usual. She paused her composition and chatted with Yan Lü for a long time.

Yan Lü was determined to ally with Lin Junbi rather than being led by the family’s instructions, so throughout this journey, he harbored some reservations, although he concealed them well. After all, Lin Junbi had always seemed to Yan Lü like an insurmountable barrier. Once he reached a higher realm, especially the day he could truly take on some responsibilities within the Yan family, Lin Junbi’s prominence in the Shao Yuan Dynasty would greatly hinder his ascent. But now, Yan Lü had changed his perspective. It was better to accept his fate and sincerely assist Lin Junbi, believing that with her vision, she would see him as a very competent right-hand man.

Yan Lü hoped to ally with Lin Junbi because of her presence. Some potential benefits that he had lost could be compensated for from others, perhaps even much more.

Having shed his inner conflict, Yan Lü became much more straightforward, speaking freely with Lin Junbi.

Lin Junbi, who no longer spoke of how severely her heart had been hurt or how she was no longer "perfect," actually relieved Yan Lü quite a bit.

Lin Junbi had long seen through Yan Lü’s character, so his change in mindset didn’t surprise her, and their cooperation would pose no issues.

In the future, Yan Lü would not be a trivial role in the Shao Yuan Dynasty.

Today, Senior Brother Bianjing made a rare appearance and had a match of chess with Lin Junbi.

Bianjing smiled, "Haven’t you been disgusted enough by Yan Lü and these people?"

Lin Junbi shook her head, "On the contrary, people can be useful."

Bianjing followed suit, shaking his head, glancing at the chessboard, "I find it quite nauseating. Many words, if one truly feels justified, aren’t bad. It’s just that perspectives differ and knowledge varies, leading to different expressions. Ultimately, reasoning remains reasoning. As for what’s right or wrong, that’s secondary. Take Jiang Guanzheng, for example. Those who choose not to speak, like Jin Zhenmeng, aren’t any better. As for the rest, the vast majority are just spouting nonsense; that’s not great, is it? How do we stand in the Sword Qi Great Wall? Don’t they know? The reputation destroyed was theirs, right? Who remembers who they are? In the end, it’s still you, Lin Junbi, who has faced all sorts of difficulties during this trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall, hindering you from plotting your master’s grand plan one after another."

"I’ll return home to apologize to my master."

Lin Junbi waited quietly for Bianjing to make his move, smiling, "Huddling together for warmth is human nature. Among the masses, those with high morals are often isolated."

One hidden purpose of the Shao Yuan Dynasty was indeed Yu Jianfu.

Lin Junbi actually didn’t understand this and found it inappropriate. After all, Yu Jianfu's fiancé was that Huai Qian. No matter how proud Lin Junbi was, she was fully aware that, for the time being, she was absolutely incomparable to Huai Qian, whether in cultivation, family background, maturity, or opportunities. However, her master hadn’t elaborated on the reasons, so Lin Junbi could only take it one step at a time. Her master had only issued a couple of stern words, "A pampered Yu Jianfu returning to the Yu family to regain her identity is tantamount to half of the Shao Yuan Dynasty’s national power."

"Even the stone lions at the gates of the noble mansions aren’t clean; how could there be a clean green brick on the Golden Luan Hall in the eyes of the common people?"

As for her cultivation, the National Master wasn’t worried about Lin Junbi; he merely posed a series of questions to test this favored disciple: "How should one view a monarch as a moral sage? How should one measure a monarch’s gains and losses? How should one assess how rulers regard the welfare of the people to be worthy?"

Bianjing remarked, "It seems you have no major issues?"

Lin Junbi smiled, "If my brother had seen that I had major issues, would I still have a chance?"

After Bianjing made his move, he asked, "Do you know why you keep losing?"

Lin Junbi nodded, "I know."

Bianjing nodded, "Then I won’t say much more."

However, Lin Junbi was certain that the answer in Bianjing's heart differed from her own understanding.

Bianjing and Lin Junbi continued their chess game, each with their own thoughts.

At the training ground in Ningfu, the elder sister and junior sister engaged in a friendly contest of wits.

The competition was quite civilized.

The completely martial Pei Qian was wielding her chaotic sword technique, while sword cultivator Guo Zhujiu practiced her fist techniques. They each showcased their respective skills without actually fighting.

Chen Ping'an left the house, intending to wait for Cui Dongshan’s return.

As he approached the training ground, the two young girls immediately ceased their fist and sword practice.

Pei Qian exclaimed, "Junior sister, your fists carry sword techniques! What a stunning swordsmanship! All those years of diligent practice weren’t in vain!"

Guo Zhujiu praised, "Elder sister, you conceal the essence of fist techniques within your swordsmanship. Your fist techniques are unbeatable! Truly worthy of being the elder sister, having been by Master’s side the longest!"

Pei Qian nodded, "Junior sister is exceptional! At this pace, if you continue practicing fist techniques, you’ll surely be able to shatter several bricks with a single punch."

Guo Zhujiu echoed, "Elder sister is remarkable! After a few years of practicing swordsmanship, traversing mountains and water, you’ll surely leave no grass behind."

Having been trained under the same master, they were indeed affectionate and harmonious.

Chen Ping'an pretended not to see or hear them as he walked past the training ground toward the entrance of Ningfu.

Once Chen Ping'an was gone, Pei Qian raised her walking stick high.

Guo Zhujiu shook the treasure string on her wrist.

Pei Qian smiled, "I still have a small bamboo box!"

Then Pei Qian deliberately paused before adding, "Not that I’m exaggerating; you’ve seen it with your own eyes."

Guo Zhujiu laughed, "I don’t have a small bamboo box!"

She imitated her, pausing for a moment before saying, "Do you have my ‘none’? No, right? So, do you want one?"

Pei Qian was taken aback, feeling that this girl was a bit silly.

Guo Zhujiu thought this girl was a bit foolish.

Chen Ping'an, who had already walked some distance away, looked back secretly and smiled. If possible, the future of Laopo Mountain should be quite lively.

Thus, after waiting for Cui Dongshan at the entrance, Chen Ping'an reached out and held his arm, pulling the white-clad youth through the door. As they walked, he said, "In the future, when we go to the Qingming world’s Bai Yujing with Master, you won’t say a word? Master will consider it as your agreement; it’s settled. Just keep quiet; good, very good."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 719: The Winds of Change

Fan Dache still couldn’t break through the bottleneck of the Dragon Gate Realm, remaining a mere Golden Elixir guest.

No matter how much wine he drank, he always ended up paying for the drinks. He still lacked the boldness of the second shopkeeper; guilt gnawed at him, making him feel indebted to the training grounds of the Ning residence and the puppet from Fatty Yan's family that helped him practice swordplay. So, whenever it came to drinking, it was always Fan Dache who picked up the tab. This wasn’t the worst of it; even if Fan Dache wasn’t at the table, as long as there was money, it was considered his expense at the Shanzhang Tavern. Among them, Dong Huafu had the most frequent drink runs. Initially, Fan Dache was confused about how the tavern could allow credit. When he asked, he learned that it was Chen Sanqiu who had taken it upon himself to place a small deposit at the tavern for him. When Fan Dache inquired about how much of that deposit remained, he was met with a heartbreaking revelation. With no other choice, he ordered several jars of Qing Shen Mountain wine and got himself thoroughly drunk.

Two boys of the same age, Zhang Jiazheng from Lingxi Alley and Jiang Qu from Suna Alley, had become inseparable friends, sharing their dreams with one another, though neither was particularly grand.

The storyteller on the bench had been showing up less and less frequently, and his tales of mountains and rivers became increasingly scarce.

That child with the pottery jar and private stash of coins, whose father helped the tavern make spring noodles, felt that this wasn’t a sustainable situation. The stories, no matter how poorly told, were still stories. If worse came to worst, he would buy stories from the storyteller himself; was a single copper coin enough? Now that his father had earned a lot of money, he often tossed him a few coins, and in less than a year, Feng Kangle’s pottery jar would be nearly overflowing. With money in hand and courage bolstered, Feng Kangle set off on his own to Ningfu Street, a place he had never visited before. However, after wandering for half a day, he didn’t dare knock on the door. The door was too big, and he was too small; Feng Kangle felt that even if he knocked with all his might, the people inside wouldn’t hear him.

When the storyteller was seated on the bench, the boy who had first greeted the second shopkeeper felt no fear. But once the storyteller hid behind the high walls of the Ning residence, the boy grew frightened and squatted in the sun at the foot of the wall for half the day. Before dark, he left the bluestone street, which could serve as a mirror, and as he walked, he would twist his ankle just to make his shoe soles squeak. He would play along the way, but not too much, fearing that he might disturb someone and end up getting beaten.

Once he reached the yellow mud road of his alley, that joy vanished. His shoes got dirty, and while his father didn’t care, his mother did. Getting a beating was no fun at all. Often, when his mother started hitting him, he would end up crying on his own, and his father would sit at the door, brooding silently. At that moment, the boy felt most wronged, hurting himself while wondering what was wrong with his parents. Why did these adults, who seemed less mature than children, lack reason?

When Feng Kangle returned to his alley, there were many children eagerly waiting, all hoping to hear those stories from far-off lands once more.

Feng Kangle had no way to express his fear. He couldn’t admit that he was scared; he had only seen the big door without seeing the storyteller. In his heart, he murmured a few apologies to the storyteller, feeling heartbroken as he lamented how the second shopkeeper was too stingy, dismissing the few coins in his pottery jar and now was no longer willing to tell stories. This fellow was blinded by money and had no conscience. The other children joined Feng Kangle in cursing, but by the end, their anger was less than their regrets.

After all, the last story hadn’t been finished. It was just getting to the part where the mountain deity forcibly married someone, and the scholar beat the drum to cry out against injustice at the City God’s Pavilion. They at least wanted to know if the scholar managed to rescue the poor girl he loved. Was the second shopkeeper not afraid that the scholar would keep banging on the drum until he broke it at the City God’s gate?

That girl, who wasn’t very pretty but always brought enough sunflower seeds, felt the most disappointed. Because the storyteller had grown accustomed to taking her seeds, when she played house afterward, she would pretend to be a bride in a sedan chair. Feng Kangle and the others would build her a structure to sit on top, swaying gently. Yet, since the storyteller had not carried his bench and bamboo stick to appear for a long time, she was back to being just one of them, while she had to play the role of a servant girl.

Moreover, the storyteller had secretly promised her that next time it snowed, they would have a snowball fight together. How could he back out of that promise?

It took her a lot of effort to get her parents to buy more sunflower seeds; she didn’t dare eat them, saving them for the New Year. But in her hometown, it seemed like there was no difference between celebrating the New Year and not; it wasn’t as lively as the storyteller had described, with children wearing new clothes, collecting red envelopes from their parents, and families sticking door gods and spring couplets on their doors, feasting on a table piled high with New Year’s dinner.

Yet every time the storyteller finished a story or a segment, he, who liked to tell tales of mountains and supernatural beings, would always say things that were no longer relevant to the stories, like how drinking at the tavern could lead to companionship with a group of sword immortals, and turning around, those sword immortals would be feasting on spring noodles and pickled vegetables. It was rare to find such scenes anywhere else in the Vast World, no amount of money could buy it. Then he would say that no matter where in the world one traveled, whether better or worse than their hometown, there would always be just one hometown, the one that evokes the most memories. Unfortunately, once a story ended, everyone would scatter, uninterested in such talk.

These were the most trivial matters in the human world. The alleys where the children lived were too small to contain much; the little winds and rains would wash everything away. The children themselves could hardly remember, let alone others.

Ultimately, the stories told by the storyteller on the bench weren’t enough, even the mountain spirit that carried the mountain deity’s sedan chair had to be given a name, and the details of their attire, and they needed opportunities to show off. Even the origins of winter pickled vegetables and how they crunched had to be explained, leaving the children yearning. After all, even if it wasn’t the New Year in the region near the Sword Qi Great Wall, everyone still had to endure the freezing cold of winter.

Adjacent to the wild world was the Sword Qi Great Wall, where the sea of clouds below seemed like steps built by a drunken artisan. The actions of the sword immortals here were almost all significant events. Of course, that included the swinging of the female sword immortal Zhou Cheng year after year, Mi Yu sleeping soundly on the cloud bed day and night, and the two rival Zhao Ge and Cheng Quan, who spat at each other after drinking, which could hardly be considered significant.

The Taihui Sword Sect, along with numerous other major sword sects, had begun preparations to withdraw from the Sword Qi Great Wall in batches. Among them, Chen, Dong, and Qi, along with several prominent families and old sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall, were all in agreement. After all, having fought side by side with the local sword cultivators in one major battle was already sufficient; it was just that the two recent battles had come too closely together, delaying the return of the outsiders to their hometowns.

Some had joked that the emotional bond built with the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall was the most worthless sentiment in the world, and whoever took it seriously was a fool. However, those who spoke such nonsense were often the ones who had killed the least yet were among the most significant. If that great demon didn’t have enough weight, how could it carve the latest character on the city’s walls?

However, not all the foreign sword cultivators from Beiju Lu Province returned to the Vast World; for example, the head of the Taihui Sword Sect, Han Huaizi, remained at the Sword Qi Great Wall, as did several other sword immortals from Beiju Lu Province. The ones who left were mostly young people, while the older, higher-ranked cultivators stayed behind. There were also those who came alone, like Li Cai from Floating Duck Lake and Yuan Qingshu, a sword cultivator from Nanpoza. In addition to sword immortals, many earthly sword cultivators from various sects across the Nine Continents also chose to remain.

Fortunately, the Shanzhang Tavern was expanding rapidly, having acquired the two adjacent shops and added two walls specifically for hanging the “No Business” signs.

Thus, the sword cultivators, primarily from Beiju Lu Province and especially the disciples of the Taihui Sword Sect, left their names and words at the tavern. Those who went there to drink often brought along local sword cultivators they had fought alongside in two major battles, which created a new trend. On one side of the “No Business” sign, a pair of foreign sword cultivators and local sword cultivators, who had become life-and-death friends, wrote their messages. Some were polite compliments, others were curses, while some were the drunken ramblings of intoxicated individuals, and still others were directly copied from the records of the Bi Sword Immortal’s emblem and folding fan—anything and everything.

Among them, one “No Business” sign was inscribed by a young Golden Elixir sword cultivator from Fuyao Prefecture, who wrote on the front: “I’ve seen many No Business signs, daring to say, our sword cultivators of the Vast World may not be as skilled as those of the Sword Qi Great Wall, but our characters are far superior!”

On the back, there was a name and words from a Nascent Soul sword cultivator of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The name was written fairly neatly, but the other words on the sign were immediately revealed to be crooked and messy: “What about those from the Vast World who can’t even write properly, just like that second shopkeeper who can’t even sell wine? We need a dozen more like us at the Sword Qi Great Wall; the more the merrier.”

Left and Right were discussing some sword technique insights when the major sword immortal appeared, prompting Wei Jin to take his leave.

Chen Qingdu waved him to stay, “Just stay; in my eyes, your swordsmanship is all about the same level.”

Wei Jin forced a smile.

The major sword immortal wanted to boost the morale of his seniors, so he shouldn’t drag along the younger generation.

Chen Qingdu spoke plainly, “Actually, I have something to ask of you. To put it bluntly, it’s not quite right to say I’m asking; it’s a command from your master and my expectation. Whether you listen is up to you. Once you follow your decision, then you can follow my sword.”

Wei Jin felt helpless.

This was non-negotiable, at least for him. How Left and Right would decide was still uncertain.

Left asked, “Why not speak directly to me?”

Chen Qingdu smiled, “Your master said things you wouldn’t listen to, what else would there be? If I heard it, the most reasonable scholar in the Vast World would end up with a reputation for loose discipline?”

Left replied, “Indeed, I’ve been a cause of worry for my master.”

As long as one spoke well of their master, it would resonate with Left, as it was the only thing that worked.

Chen Qingdu turned to Wei Jin, “Wei Jin, I advise you to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, but you might not be willing to. So, you can have another battle and then hear me out. When you leave, there will be three places for you to choose from: Nanpoza, Fuyao Prefecture, and Jinjia Prefecture. You can treat it as a sightseeing trip. Wei Jin of Treasure Bottle Prefecture shouldn’t be just a heartbroken fool; besides, where’s the point in staying at the Sword Qi Great Wall? If the girl you fancy is too far away, you won’t even get to see her.”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “Being this blunt is naturally because your swordsmanship is lower than Left’s. So after you leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, remember to practice hard. When your skills improve, at least you can catch up to Left, and I’ll have to worry less next time.”

Wei Jin sighed, “Is it really just like this, Major Sword Immortal?”

Chen Qingdu raised his chin, “Why ask me? Ask your sword.”

Wei Jin felt even more helpless.

When he left this time, the major sword immortal didn’t try to keep him.

Only two skilled swordsmen remained.

Chen Qingdu remarked, “Your little junior brother didn’t agree to light the longevity lamp, but made a small deal with me. In the future, on the battlefield, save him once or save the one he wants to save.”

Chen Qingdu smiled, “So afraid of death, but suddenly not afraid anymore. How come Left, who usually says little, suddenly has so much to say? What are the disciples of the Scholars’ lineage thinking?”

Left replied, “If you want to know, it’s simple.”

Naturally, it starts with being a disciple of our Scholars’ lineage.

Chen Qingdu laughed heartily, “I advise you not to say it out loud. Your juniors are still at the Sword Qi Great Wall, and in their hearts, the unrivaled uncle master will end up with a bruised nose and a swollen face. How embarrassing.”

Left didn’t mind the major sword immortal’s words, just that he was more concerned about a larger matter, asking, “If he comes, what should we do?”

Chen Qingdu, hands behind his back, stroked his head, brushing through his hair, “The door is wide open, welcoming guests for a thousand years. Sword immortals facing enemies will only complain that the demons aren’t significant enough; don’t you understand this?”

Left nodded, “That makes sense.”

Chen Qingdu teased, “Oh, finally thinking about drawing your sword for yourself?”

Left replied, “The Scholars’ lineage only speaks reason, not boasting. As the eldest senior brother and uncle master, I will make sure my fellow disciples know that the highest swordsmanship in the Vast World is not overrated; that evaluation is still too low.”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “Even higher? How much higher? On tiptoes, stretching your neck to my shoulders?”

Left said, “Chen Qingdu, let’s have a match, isolating the world.”

Chen Qingdu, hands behind his back, walked away.

Left closed his eyes again, nurturing his sword intent.

The next great battle would be the most suitable time to unleash all he had.

Far off, the girl Zhou Cheng was still swinging on her swing, humming a cryptic, hard-to-understand folk song from another place.

It was a song taught to her many years ago by a young man from afar when she was still a girl herself—though it wasn’t exactly teaching; he liked to sit near the swing, humming to himself. Back then, she hadn’t thought it sounded good and didn’t want to learn. She had barely enough time to practice her swordplay; what use were such frivolous things?

Later, Zhou Cheng first heard the term “wild cultivation of mountains and valleys.” He had said that the reason he came here was to catch a glimpse of his ideal hometown. There was no emotional attachment; he just wanted to take a look.

The major sword immortal Lu Zhi walked up beside the swing, reaching out to grasp a rope, giving it a gentle shake.

Zhou Cheng didn’t turn her head but softly asked, “Sister Lu, why don’t you go see your ideal hometown? You wouldn’t die; besides, you’ve accumulated so many battle achievements. The major sword immortal already promised you long ago that once your merits were sufficient, he wouldn’t stop you.”

Lu Zhi shook her head, “The reason for that promise was to give myself a thought outside of practicing the sword. Just because I can doesn’t mean I must.”

Zhou Cheng fell silent.

Lu Zhi gently swayed the swing, “If I could go to the Hanging Mountain without a hitch, then that thought would be concluded. Right now, my thoughts are directed south, to two very distant places: drinking horses at the Yeluo River and resting my sword at the Moon-Dragging Mountain.”

Zhou Cheng turned her head and smiled, “That guy who can’t speak properly? Do you like him?”

Lu Zhi shook her head, “Just because I’m a woman doesn’t mean I have to like men. I don’t like myself liking someone; I only like not liking anyone at all.”

Zhou Cheng laughed, “Sister Lu, you speak just like those people from the Vast World.”

“Zhou Cheng, what will you do when the swing is gone one day?”

“If a person is gone, it doesn’t matter.”

“Is liking someone really worth it?”

“It’s not that I particularly like him. Anyway, if everything is gone, and I’m the only one left in the sect, what else can I think about? Sister Lu, you have good talent; you can pursue that thought. I’m not capable; thinking about it is pointless, so I won’t.”

Lu Zhi gazed southward, her expression indifferent, “There are more than a few sword immortals who can only wait for death. Don’t you think that’s laughable?”

Zhou Cheng didn’t respond and didn’t laugh.

The sword immortal Li Cai from Beiju Lu Province was not one to settle down easily; today he asked for a duel with Han Huaizi from the Taihui Sword Sect, and tomorrow he would seek other sword immortals. If he couldn’t find a match among the sword immortals, he’d bully the Nascent Soul sword cultivators, shouting that as a woman, they couldn’t even win against her. Not only that, but they wouldn’t even dare to fight back. Was that still manly?

The Nascent Soul sword cultivators often felt indignant, and after losing, they would call upon friends. Who didn’t have a sword immortal friend at the Sword Qi Great Wall? If that sword immortal came out of retirement, if Li Cai won, that would be fine, but if someone else dueled her and lost, they would return to find that Nascent Soul cultivator, and after a few rounds, that Nascent Soul cultivator would wear a sorrowful expression, no longer wishing to see his sword immortal friends. He would tell Li Cai that even if he was taking advantage of opportunities, he couldn’t keep exploiting her too much.

Thus, he secretly helped introduce Li Cai to another Nascent Soul cultivator, claiming that this guy knew even more sword immortal friends.

Li Cai gradually grew fond of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

There were endless fights, and regardless of the outcome, there were no lingering worries. It was far better than the restraint and obligation to maintain connections and emotional ties in Beiju Lu Province. 

Li Cai almost considered marrying someone at random to stay here.

However, as soon as this thought arose, she felt somewhat guilty towards Jiang Shangzhen. But upon second thought, what kind of man was Jiang Shangzhen? He wouldn’t be devoted to any one woman in his lifetime; what was the point of liking him? Wouldn’t that be demeaning herself? But when the female sword immortal sat atop the city walls or recuperated at her residence in Wanheju, she couldn’t help but feel fondness, which drove Li Cai to drink herself into oblivion.

Li Cai’s temporary residence at Wanheju was not far from the now private property of the Taihui Sword Sect’s armory, and even closer to the main structure of the Stop Cloud Pavilion, entirely sculpted from jade.

Li Cai sent a letter to Jiang Shangzhen, asking him to buy it. Worrying that he might be reluctant, she doubled the price in her letter.

An old man, thin as a rail and with a nose like a wine jar, occasionally left his residence, swaying as he walked along the city walls, taking in the scenery. He seldom came here; the wind was too strong.

As he passed a jade-pillar sword cultivator dragging his sword along, though they were far apart, Wu Chengpei, who had been distracted, suddenly turned his head, glaring at the old man with reddened eyes, cursing, “Old bastard, get lost!”

The old man was nicknamed the Old Deaf Man at the Sword Qi Great Wall. The nickname lacked intimidation, but he was genuinely among the top ten at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Not to mention, he ranked even higher than Nalan Shaoyi and Lu Zhi.

To put it bluntly, in a place like the Sword Qi Great Wall where everyone had a bad temper, just based on Wu Chengpei’s extremely offensive words, the old man could have drawn his sword. Who obstructed him would suffer the consequences.

However, the Old Deaf Man truly acted like a deaf person; not only did he say nothing, but he also quickened his pace, disappearing like smoke in an instant.

Only then did Wu Chengpei continue on his way, head down.

The Old Deaf Man walked slowly, some greeted him while others ignored him. He kept silent.

But when he reached the monk, he stood still, hoarsely saying, “Let’s talk about Buddhist teachings again; after all, I can’t hear.”

At the far end of the city wall, the monk began discussing Buddhist principles.

Outside the monk’s mat was a misty white fog, occasionally a flash of gold light would suddenly brighten and fade, a mystical scene as if the river of time was disturbed by something invisible, splashing water droplets. 

The monk reached out like he was scooping water, but he was still too slow to grasp that glimmer of gold and retracted his hand, marking it as another failed attempt.

The Old Deaf Man then went to the Confucian sage at the other end of the city wall. The old man said similar words, and the scholar also spoke a few. The Old Deaf Man nodded and made his way to an old Taoist at a high place in the sea of clouds, the eldest disciple of the Daoist ancestor. After the old Taoist had spoken a few words, the Old Deaf Man finally left the city wall and went to the prison he had been guarding for thousands of years. This prison had no name, and it was strange; the higher-ranked demons were often imprisoned closer to the ground. As the Old Deaf Man passed by the cages, he heard curses and jeers but paid no mind to them. As for the furious roars of the demons that could shake the entire prison, the old man ignored them entirely, his hunchbacked back never lifting, so he didn’t even notice the piercing hatred in their gazes. Finally, he reached the lower levels to teach swordsmanship to those low-ranking demons. Whether they learned or not was of little concern; after all, they were all doomed to die eventually, be it early or late, none could say who was luckier.

The Major Sword Immortal had earlier tasked him with a job: on the day he had to fight at the city wall, aside from the three lives earned from his merits, as per their agreement, he could stay behind, but he shouldn’t forget to kill all the demons within the prison. If he missed that instruction, he would truly be deaf; how could a dead ascendant-level demon not be deaf?

The Old Deaf Man held no resentment; over the thousands of years, he had picked out three demons, and the only problem was that no matter how good their qualifications were, given enough time, they would inevitably break through their boundaries. The reason was simple; how could one live for hundreds or thousands of years without sufficient cultivation? So with each historical loss, the old man sighed, waiting and waiting. Now, among the three unnamed disciples who still lived, several had already died quietly while practicing swordplay.

Among the three, one was at the Cave Dwelling Realm, another at the Dragon Gate Realm, and one was on the verge of losing his mind at the bottleneck of the Golden Elixir Realm.

The Old Deaf Man was quite open about taking on disciples; once they reached the Nascent Soul Realm, they would have to die. Thus, whether to break through or not was up to them to weigh.

Outside the Sword Qi Great Wall, apart from the mirage at the far north, there were also the armory, Wanheju, and Stop Cloud Pavilion, as well as some barely viable scenic spots, but those that could be classified as forbidden areas included the sword workshop managed by the Dong family, the clothing workshop run by the Qi family, and the pill workshop held by the Chen family.

The swords forged at the sword workshop had never been of particularly good quality; they were merely standard long swords that couldn’t even be considered magic treasures. Sword immortals could take them or leave them, and every sword cultivator entering the city would be gifted one, whether they liked it or not. The offspring of noble families, whether relying on family inheritance or spending lavishly to buy one from the Vast World, as long as they could acquire a good sword, it was a feat.

In fact, many sword immortals preferred to carry swords forged at the workshop, having killed countless demons with them.

The clothing workshop weaved robes, but the quality was equally subpar.

At first glance, it all seemed trivial.

However, these two places were undeniably crucial to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were no sword immortals who fell from the sky; all were sword cultivators who rose through the ranks, differing only in speed. Their cultivation remained constant.

The function of the pill workshop was even more straightforward: it utilized the corpses of demons killed at the city walls or the southern battlefields, skinning and extracting their essence, putting everything to use. But it wasn’t just that; the pill workshop was the most chaotic and mixed area among the three teachings and nine streams, with the largest number of alchemists and talismans practitioners. Some came willingly to sign contracts for a hundred or several hundred years, making enough money to leave, while others were forcibly taken from their homes, or were those avoiding calamities hiding here among the aloof masters of the Vast World.

The Sword Qi Great Wall relied on this pill workshop to conduct numerous trades with the many cross-continental ferries lingering at the Hanging Mountain port.

Moreover, the pill workshop was closely connected to the prison where the Old Deaf Man kept watch; after all, the blood, bones, and demon cores from many high-ranking demons were priceless treasures.

These three places were strictly regulated and heavily guarded. Entering was easy, but exiting was difficult, with no exceptions for sword immortals.

Among the massive strokes inscribed on the southern city walls, there was a type of sword cultivator, regardless of age or rank, who stayed far from the city's disputes, occasionally traveling to the city walls and north in complete silence.

They were responsible for going to the wild lands to “collect money.”

Similar to the scouts of the secular dynasties in the Vast World.

So even the lowest cultivation would still be at the Dragon Gate Realm, and every trip south would have a sword immortal leading the way.

In the past, two outstanding young sword cultivators, Chen Sanqiu from a prestigious noble family and the struggling street rat Xiao Qiuqiu, had completely different backgrounds. Their greatest wish at that time was to be able to go south and collect money.

And the sword cultivator who collected money the most and traveled the farthest liked to call himself a swordsman. He often claimed that his roguish lifestyle wasn't to attract the attention of women but simply because he genuinely enjoyed the rivers and lakes.

The wild lands in the south were a vast river and lake where he could encounter many interesting events.

However, every time he shared these grand statements that left the younger generation in awe, that person would scurry off to the tavern to drink, heading where there were plenty of women to catch their eye.

Time and again he returned, reeking of wine, only to laugh and say to those he disliked, “You guys almost called me dad or even ancestor; luckily, I held back, filled with righteous energy, beauty can’t get too close!”

If a kid dared to retort, he would never lose, saying that their family’s someone was merely boasting about their looks, not even qualifying as beauty. But that didn’t matter; in his eyes, the girls who secretly admired him were far more beautiful than they appeared. With a little heart, one could discover countless beautiful sights.

“Don’t understand? Come, come, let me open your eyes—this is the unique skill of the Vast World, easily kept secret…” 

Yet, each time after these jokes, one or a few in the group would be missing when they set off south to collect money, or even worse, the entire unit would be wiped out. By the time living souls gathered again, those familiar faces would never be seen again. Those who hadn’t understood then, or pretended not to understand, would find themselves unable to claim comprehension anymore.

At that time, that person would grow silent, drinking alone.

Once, after the sword cultivators gradually returned, that person squatted in a certain spot, but ultimately did not wait for a familiar team to return, only encountering a great demon. The great demon, brandishing a spear high, looked like it was holding a string of candied hawthorns.

Stopping far away from the Sword Qi Great Wall, it pointed directly at him, laughing as it hurled the spear towards a certain spot on the southern city wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

That person caught the spear, gently handed it to those behind him, and then set off, traversing thousands of miles, entering the heart of the wild lands, drawing his sword at the Moon-Dragging Mountain and the Yeluo River, wielding his sword whenever a great demon appeared.

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal, with his naturally forlorn face, finally wore a smile recently.

Lin Junbi had captured two strands of pure sword intent left behind by ancient sword immortals, both of extremely high quality, combining fortune, opportunity, and means. It was meant to be his, sooner or later. But in just a short time, it wasn’t one strand but two, still exceeding the expectations of the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal.

Such mysterious fortunes at the Sword Qi Great Wall were not solely due to high cultivation; even sword immortals could not take them by force. If one wasn’t careful, they could trigger a surge of sword intent that would counterattack. History had not lacked for greedy foreign sword immortals ensnared in the siege of sword intent. The danger level was not less than that of a careless Cave Dwelling Realm cultivator swaggering through the city gates.

Yan Lü and Jin Zhenmeng also made some gains; Yan Lü mostly relied on luck to retain a strand of feminine sword intent, a result of fate and closeness to the Dao. 

Jin Zhenmeng appeared to rely more on her Golden Elixir sword cultivator level, managing to retain that unruly sword intent. As long as the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal didn’t involve himself in personal matters and only spoke of sword-related issues, he still had a sharp eye; after all, he was Zhou Shenzhi’s disciple. Without real skills, he would have long been scolded by Zhou Shenzhi until his sword heart shattered. 

In Bitter Summer Sword Immortal’s eyes, Jin Zhenmeng, this reticent junior, was clearly the kind that had lofty aspirations. That heavy killing intent of pure sword intent had chosen her gentle nature, and it was no accident; in fact, it was the opposite. Jin Zhenmeng’s sincerity earned her that sword intent’s favor. The intense clash that occurred within Jin Zhenmeng’s energy realm, where external sword intent drew the sword qi of the small world to “visit,” seemed perilous but was, in essence, a simple test. It was sufficient to eliminate many flaws in Jin Zhenmeng’s spirit. If she couldn’t pass this test, it was likely she would fall in rank because of it.

Aside from the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal, the talented individuals of the Shao Yuan Dynasty were no longer sword immortals.

However, even among them, many would still not become upper-level sword immortals in the future. Compared to the trivial matters in the northern city, even without the fortunes earned by Lin Junbi and the others, they still accumulated small benefits along their cultivation paths. Upon reaching the central continent’s Shao Yuan Dynasty, how could that be considered a small matter? Just walking around the foot of the mountain, one could easily determine life and death, deciding the honor and disgrace of others.

Outside Lin Junbi, Yan Lü was fine, but even Jin Zhenmeng received a considerable opportunity, causing Jiang Guancheng to feel somewhat anxious. Many were in a similar mindset as Jiang Guancheng.

Even if Lin Junbi gained immense fortune, the other sword cultivators felt no significant resentment. However, when Yan Lü got lucky, it caused discomfort in their hearts. Now that even someone like Jin Zhenmeng, who possessed only cultivation but little understanding, gained something, Jiang Guancheng and the others found it hard to bear.

Zhu Mei remained indifferent.

Whenever she had free time, she would look for the man she nicknamed “In the Stream,” an aloof fellow who hardly spoke, while she chattered away.

It was rare for “In the Stream” to say more, arguing with Zhu Mei over whether it was a master’s stele or a master’s letter, a master’s sword or a master’s pen. Zhu Mei would purposely twist the argument, going back and forth until she finally smiled and conceded, realizing she had only done so to get him to speak more.

In a good mood, the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal returned to Sun’s residence and unexpectedly sought out Sun Juyuan for drinks. However, he found that Sun the Sword Immortal no longer had that celestial wine cup; he was just holding a wine jug.

Sun Juyuan seemed unwilling to speak. The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal shared a few heartfelt words.

“I’m just a sword cultivator. After ascending the mountain to practice, I’ve only ever known how to practice swordsmanship. Therefore, many matters I won’t interfere in, nor do I like to.”

Sun Juyuan glanced at the sincere foreign sword immortal, nodded, “I hold no opinions about you; even if I did, they would merely be good opinions.”

Sun Juyuan sat in the corridor, one leg bent, extending a hand to pat his knee, “Cultivators are solitary, distancing themselves from the mundane world, keeping themselves pure. What else can be expected? It’s quite good already.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal sighed, “But any major sect that becomes influential will be bustling and crowded, eventually no longer as simple as solitary cultivation. This is why I’m unwilling to establish a sect; I only know how to practice the sword and won’t teach the Dao. I fear that I would end up teaching many disciples whose swordsmanship rises while their hearts sink. I never was good at reasoning; wouldn’t that make things worse?”

“My master is quite good; his swordsmanship is high. All his disciples, no matter their temperament, must earnestly ponder my master’s thoughts and ideas, without needing him to teach them principles.”

Sun Juyuan shook his head, leaning against the wall, gently swaying the wine jug, “Bitter Summer, oh Bitter Summer, you don’t even realize where your master excels. I advise you not to establish a sect in this lifetime; you truly lack that capability.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal’s slight good mood was dashed by Sun Juyuan’s words, and his forlorn face became even gloomier.

Sun Juyuan gazed into the distance and softly said, “If the people from the mountains in the Vast World could all be like you, that would be wonderful. Few words, few deeds.”

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal extended his hand, “Give me a jug of wine; I want to drink too.”

Sun Juyuan flipped his wrist, tossing a jug over.

The Bitter Summer Sword Immortal’s expression grew even more forlorn.

Because it was a jug of Bamboo Sea Cave Sky wine.

The Sword Qi Great Wall was the place most prone to jokes.

Because even their lives could be made into a joke, what else would they fear?

Yet, the Sword Qi Great Wall remained the Sword Qi Great Wall, without chaotic rules on paper, yet still possessing some bizarre unwritten rules that should not exist elsewhere.

If a mid-level sword cultivator saw a certain sword immortal they disliked, whether drinking or not, they would curse loudly. As long as the sword immortal ignored them, everyone would ignore them back.

But once the sword immortal acknowledged them, they would have to endure.

Whether it was a foreigner practicing swordsmanship or admiring the scenery at the Sword Qi Great Wall, no matter whose disciple it was, regardless of how well they fared in the Vast World, at the Sword Qi Great Wall, sword cultivators would neither look up to them nor disdain them; everything was spoken through the sword. Being able to gain face from the Sword Qi Great Wall was a skill. If one lost face here and felt unhappy, returning to their own Vast World, they could freely speak out, and it would be best never to return to the Sword Qi Great Wall again; it was best not to approach the Hanging Mountain.

In history, many sword immortals and cultivators who died alone left behind nothing but what was deemed unowned. 

If there were no final wishes, everything left behind would be considered unclaimed. 

If there were final wishes, someone would take everything, regardless of how vast the treasure was or even the sword immortal’s treasured sword. Even a lower-level sword cultivator obtaining these would not cause contention; openly they wouldn’t dare, and secretly they were likely to act sneakily. 

It was a given that the Hidden Officials’ lineage weren’t fools; many families that could nearly move to Tai Xiang Street or Yu Hu Street found themselves severely weakened because of this. 

The reasoning was simple: lack of strict discipline. Except for those who reached out, the dead would be dealt with first. The highest-ranked individual from the family would be beaten half to death by Luo Shan or the Zhuan'an Sword Immortal. 

If they couldn’t do it, it didn’t matter; the Hidden Officials were more than willing to help, and in the end, one could retain half a life. After all, they still had to kill demons; in the next battle, this person must retreat from the battlefield alive, and then it would be cleared up. 

Yet all this meant that even many sword immortals had no grave to lie in after death; how could there be the festive atmosphere of spring couplets and door gods here?

After hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of years, all sword cultivators had grown accustomed to the thatched cottage atop the city walls, where the major sword immortal hardly ever descended.

It was as if the major sword immortal did not turn the calendar, and the calendar would cease to exist, or as if it had never existed.

Today, Wang Zai, a gentleman from the Scholars’ lineage, arrived at the tavern. This was Wang Zai’s first time buying wine here.

However, the noisy sword-using patrons looked unfavorably upon this Confucian gentleman.

Firstly, he was a scholar with titles and ranks in the Vast World, and secondly, it was said that Wang Zai, having eaten his fill, was clinging to the second shopkeeper’s past incident of killing a man with one punch, insisting on creating a moralistic article about it, putting in more effort than the supervising sword immortal from the Hidden Officials’ lineage. They were puzzled as to why the Scholars’ lineage needed to make such a fuss, kicking someone when they were down.

Wang Zai maintained a calm demeanor, paid for the wine, and left without eating a bowl of spring noodles or a plate of pickled vegetables. He chuckled to himself, feeling that the second shopkeeper should really treat him to a drink.

Instead of returning the way he came, Wang Zai carried the wine towards a deserted alley corner.

At the place where a small stool and a young man in a blue shirt should have been, he stopped, chuckling softly, “A gentleman’s words must be honorable, especially precise and detailed.”

About to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, Wang Zai remembered something and returned along the original path to the tavern, seeking an empty, blank “No Business” sign. He wrote down his origin and name, then on the back of the sign, he penned, “Treat others with leniency, but be strict with yourself. Convince others with reason, bind yourself with morality; when the world is peaceful, everything will be truly without matter.”

After finishing, Wang Zai hung the sign on the wall and glanced at the nearby signs, unable to help but laugh and cry at the same time. One sign that would likely be adorned with gold trimmings by the second shopkeeper was a “heartfelt saying” from a Golden Armor Province sword immortal: “Never cheat the second shopkeeper; his wine quality is unparalleled, Chen Pingan.”

At first glance, it was clear that this person did not intend to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall for the time being.

Another sign would certainly be regarded as “the words of a good-hearted person” by the second shopkeeper: “The Scholars’ lineage has substantial learning, but their skin is thicker; second shopkeeper, come to my Liu Xia Prefecture in the future, and I’ll treat you to some truly good wine.”

This was evidently from someone, like Wang Zai, who was also heading to the Hanging Mountain.

Wang Zai murmured to himself, “If it’s him, I should say, such a good person, yet still only a Nascent Soul sword cultivator, how unreasonable. The Jade Purity Realm is too low, and the Immortal Realm doesn’t count as high.”

Wang Zai smiled, “However, if I say this, it would be like an old woman applying rouge; it would only raise annoyance.”

Not all outsiders could become as close as Chen Pingan in the hearts of the sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Wang Zai felt a bit happy for Chen Pingan, but also a bit sentimental.

After hesitating briefly, he added a line in small script on his “No Business” sign: “For benevolence, it’s up to oneself; one desires benevolence, and thus it is attained. May those with this heart find peace in all things.”

Wang Zai noticed a boy not far away who had come to the tavern to fetch wine; his name was Jiang Qu, hailing from Suna Alley.

Wang Zai turned around, smiling at the boy, “Tell your second shopkeeper that the taste of the wine is quite good, and strive to sell more; gain it rightly and openly.”

Jiang Qu nodded earnestly, his smile bashful.

Wang Zai drained the last of the wine in his jug, placing the empty jug on the counter, laughing as he left. Upon exiting, he clasped his fists towards the many sword cultivators at the tables and along the road, exclaiming, “Who dares to buy sword and wine? But I’ll drink a thousand cups without charge!”

A profound silence enveloped the surroundings, all as expected. Wang Zai laughed heartily, “Then let’s replace it with something more straightforward; I hope one day, all you sword immortals will come here to drink, like a long whale drinking from the rivers, and the shopkeeper won’t charge a single immortal coin.”

No one showed appreciation.

Someone scoffed, “Gentleman, you wouldn’t be putting poison in the wine, would you? Even if the second shopkeeper is unreliable, he wouldn’t do such a thing; a gentleman of such stature, a sage, you shouldn’t harm the second shopkeeper.”

Wang Zai did not retort, instead laughing as he departed. After moving away, he raised his arm high, giving a thumbs up, “Very pleased to meet all of you sword immortals.”

For a moment, the tavern buzzed with discussion.

“Is the second shopkeeper possessed by him? Or has he disguised himself as the second shopkeeper? Such methods are excessive, truly excessive.”

“The second shopkeeper is impressive; even a gentleman from the Scholars’ lineage can be turned into a friend?”

“It’s likely that he’s just a somewhat conscientious scholar.”

Wang Zai distanced himself from the tavern, walking through the narrow alley, pulling out a plain white stone seal that was as smooth as jade, a gift secretly given to him by Chen Pingan. It had both edge markings and a date inscribed.

The edge marking read: “The roads are muddy, and the people are weary; the hero slashes the bandits, but the book is not recorded. True gentlemen do not indulge in frivolity; the great stone stands tall against the sky.”

The inscription read: “So it is a gentleman.”

Pei Qian finally came to her senses.

In the end, she realized that the time she had squandered could only be made up for by practicing her punches diligently.

Time and again, she would soak in the medicine barrel, lie on the bed, nurture her injuries, and then seek out the old woman to learn boxing again.

Bai Momo was unwilling to teach her husband heavy punches, but she was quite willing to teach this little girl.

It wasn’t that she didn’t like her; on the contrary, among her husband’s students, Bai Lianshuang favored Pei Qian the most.

On the surface, she seemed timid, but that little girl’s eyes held the fiercest intent.

Guo Zhujiu, who was now free from house arrest, often wandered around, watching Pei Qian get knocked down repeatedly in the training grounds until the last time she couldn’t get back up. She would rush over gently, carrying Pei Qian on her back.

Occasionally, when Guo Zhujiu was free, she would ask that old master a few questions about boxing.

One day, after Pei Qian woke up, Guo Zhujiu sat on the threshold, keeping the temporarily bedridden senior sister company, helping to ease her boredom.

As for whether the senior sister wanted to talk to her, Guo Zhujiu didn’t care. In any case, the senior sister definitely would appreciate it. If she said she was tired, Guo Zhujiu would pick up that stone inkstone, exhale a breath, and show off to the senior sister.

On this day, Bai Shou passed by again outside the residence. The door was ajar, and Bai Shou didn’t dare to touch bad luck, quickly walking past.

Guo Zhujiu then lowered her voice, asking, “Little senior sister, don’t you think that Bai Shou likes you?”

Pei Qian felt as if struck by lightning, “What?!”

Guo Zhujiu exclaimed, “You can’t see that? Do you believe I should ask Bai Shou? He’ll definitely say he doesn’t like you. But you must have heard a saying: whatever a man says is just a bunch of daytime ghost stories.”

Pei Qian had no time to consider that the matter of whether Bai Shou liked her was inconsequential. She punched the bed, “I’m infuriated!”

Guo Zhujiu lowered her head, wiping the inkstone with a sigh, “I know an old maid who often says that once a girl is married off, it’s like pouring out water. So when you become a disciple of the Taihui Sword Sect, the seat in the ancestral hall of your master’s hometown will be empty. Doesn’t that mean that apart from your master, it will be leaderless? How worrying!”

Pei Qian shouted, “You dream of usurping my position! That seat of mine has a paper with my name on it; apart from my master, no one can sit there!”

Guo Zhujiu said, “Then we’ll talk about it later; it’s not urgent.”

Pei Qian suddenly said, “What if Bai Shou likes you?”

Guo Zhujiu lifted her head, deadpan, “He’s not blind. Why would he choose to like someone like me over such an excellent senior sister?”

Pei Qian crossed her arms, chuckling, “That could be a possibility.”

Guo Zhujiu laughed, “Just now I was joking with senior sister. Whoever believes it will trip while walking.”

Pei Qian’s mouth twitched.

Pei Qian softly asked, “Guo Zhujiu, when will you come to Luopo Mountain to play with me?”

Guo Zhujiu seemed a bit listless, “I said it doesn’t count for me. My parents are strict; I can’t find a way.”

Pei Qian fell silent for a moment, smiled, “No matter how unpleasant it is to hear kind words, don’t ignore them. After all, your parents won’t scold you much, even if they open their mouths; if they say too much, they won’t be able to bear it themselves.”

Guo Zhujiu thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright.”

After a moment of silence, Guo Zhujiu glanced at the walking stick resting on the table. Taking advantage of the senior sister’s deep slumber, she earnestly cleaned the walking stick, spitting on it, wiping it with her sleeves, and even using her face, showing her sincerity.

“Senior sister, can I borrow your little bamboo box to carry for a while?”

“Why? On what basis?”

“It looks good when I carry it. Senior sister, why don’t you think before you speak? Such a clever brain, why can’t it be put to use?”

Pei Qian felt tired from chatting with Guo Zhujiu.

“Senior sister, is stinky tofu really that delicious?”

“Absolutely fragrant!”

“Is it true that if you eat stinky tofu, your farts will smell good too?”

“Guo Zhujiu, are you annoying or not?!”

Then Pei Qian saw that girl, sitting on the threshold, her mouth never stopping, speaking in sign language, just without sound.

Even if Pei Qian deliberately ignored her, she was still enjoying herself, and if she accidentally looked at her, she grew even more energized.

Pei Qian helplessly said, “You might as well start speaking again; being annoyed by you is better than my head hurting.”

Guo Zhujiu suddenly said, “If one day I can’t talk to senior sister anymore, senior sister should remember me and be annoyed, annoyed, annoyed, so you can remember me more.”

Pei Qian gazed at that girl with a smiling face, momentarily speechless.

A figure in a blue shirt sat on the threshold, extending a hand, signaling Pei Qian to lie down.

Chen Pingan sat next to Guo Zhujiu, smiling, “You’re still young; you shouldn’t say such things. Even my master doesn’t speak, so how can it be your place to say it?” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 720: The Enemy Has Arrived, the Sword Immortal is Here**

This time, when Guo Zhujiu returned home, she was no longer wandering the streets alone, nor was she perched on the walls of her neighbors’ estates in Yuhu Street like a stray cat. With her master by her side, she appeared particularly well-mannered.

A familiar young man leaned over the wall, grinning as he asked, “Green End, why aren’t you charging in like usual today? My swordsmanship has greatly improved these past few days, I’ll definitely stop you in your tracks and make you take the long way around!”

Guo Zhujiu looked up, utterly confused, and asked, “Who are you?”

Seeing that Guo Zhujiu was shooting him a furtive glance, the young man hurriedly vanished.

This was also the first time Chen Pingan visited the Guo family in Yuhu Street. Guo Jia, the Sword Immortal, personally came out to greet him. Chen Pingan only escorted Guo Zhujiu to the entrance, politely declined Guo Jia’s invitation to enter, as the Sword Immortal Luo Shan from the Hidden Official lineage had been keeping a watchful eye on him. It didn’t matter much for him in Ning’s residence, but Guo Jia and his family still needed to maintain appearances.

As Guo Jia led Guo Zhujiu inside, he casually asked, “What did you talk about with your little senior sister over there?”

Guo Zhujiu replied, “Father, no matter how much you torture me, I won’t say a word! Who do you think I am? I’m Guo Zhujiu, daughter of the great Sword Immortal Guo Jia. What I shouldn’t say, I absolutely won’t say a single word!”

Guo Jia looked down at his smiling daughter and gently patted her head, “No wonder they say a daughter grows up too fast; it breaks a father’s heart.”

Guo Zhujiu countered, “But my mother isn’t like that! She married you, yet she still protects her family at every turn. You’re the same! Every time you suffer at my mother’s place, you don’t go to complain to your master or seek out familiar sword immortal friends for a drink. Instead, you go to your father-in-law’s place to play the victim. My mother is so tired of you! You don’t even know, my grandfather has privately asked me to advise you not to go over there anymore, begging you as a grandson-in-law to spare him a little pity. Otherwise, the one who suffers the most in the end would be him, not you, the son-in-law.”

Guo Jia had long since grown accustomed to his daughter’s heart-piercing words. It was all right, as long as he was used to it. His old father-in-law should be used to it too; after all, they were family, no need for pleasantries.

Guo Jia’s previously cloudy mood brightened a little. He had been approached once before, which was a good sign. Reasonably speaking, no sword had been drawn, and he was far luckier than the great Sword Immortal Yueqing. Of course, he hadn’t drawn his sword, but he was still wearing one. Deep down, Guo Jia felt genuinely grateful to this person who wielded a sword and had come to visit—he liked that young man very much. Disciples of the Literary Sage lineage seemed to excel at discussing principles beyond words, and they spoke to those outside the Guo family.

Guo Jia had always hoped that his daughter Green End would go to Upside-down Mountain to see things, just like Ning Yao, to explore further afield and return later without worry.

However, despite her childhood love for excitement, Guo Zhujiu had never thought about sneaking off to Upside-down Mountain. Guo Jia had hinted to his wife to suggest it to their daughter, but she had delivered a reasoning that left him speechless.

Guo Zhujiu recounted how, as a child, she had climbed to the roof of her house with great effort, only to see the moon resting on the walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall. She had wanted to touch it one day, but when she grew up and went to the city wall herself, she realized it was far out of reach. She had been disappointed. Therefore, she didn’t want to travel far, knowing the city wall was so high that even if she jumped with all her might, she couldn’t reach the moon, let alone Upside-down Mountain, which would be even more impossible. It seemed pointless to her.

The purpose of this visit was to formally make Guo Zhujiu a disciple of her little senior brother, Chen Pingan. As long as Guo Jia agreed, it inherently meant that Guo Zhujiu would need to follow her fellow disciples to the Zushi Hall at Fallen Mountain to pay respects to the ancestors. After that, she could either stay at Fallen Mountain or wander elsewhere. If the young lady truly missed home, she could return to Sword Qi Great Wall later.

Guo Jia thought it was a good idea.

Once the sword-wielding visitor opened this topic, Guo Jia, a sword cultivator of the Jade Purity realm, couldn’t refuse. The other sword immortals wouldn’t dare to raise any objections either; if they did, they could take it up with the visitor.

However, Guo Zhujiu suddenly said, “Father, on the way here, my master asked me if I wanted to go to his hometown and join my little senior sister to travel through the Great Harmony World. I bravely defied my master’s orders and turned him down! Do you think I’m bold? Am I a true hero?!”

Guo Jia sighed internally and asked with a smile, “Why didn’t you agree? The apprenticeship rules in the Great Harmony World are many. We can’t compare. If it’s not a path of enlightenment, you don’t even need to bow your head; just offer a toast casually. But you’ll still need to go to the Zushi Hall for the proper rites, burn incense, and follow many formalities. If you really want to be a direct disciple of Chen Pingan, you need to blend in with the traditions.”

Guo Zhujiu shook her head, “What’s the point of following my master back to his hometown? If I leave, who will take care of your flower garden?”

Guo Jia tried hard to keep a straight face and earnestly advised, “Next time you have to swat those mosquitoes and flies, practice your swordsmanship a bit, and don’t chop up the flowers and plants as well.”

Guo Zhujiu lamented, “It’s a pity that my senior sister won’t lend me her hiking staff; otherwise, if even a single mosquito flies into your flower garden, you can just ask me to chop my own head off.”

After parting ways with his daughter, Guo Jia went to check on the flower garden. Ever since his daughter took on a master, she had been running off to Ning’s residence every day and hadn’t been taking care of the garden as diligently, so the flowers had grown particularly lush. Guo Jia stood alone in a pavilion filled with blooming flowers, gazing at the beautiful scenery but feeling no joy. If the flowers bloomed and the moon shone brightly, all would be well, but how could a person live long with everything going perfectly?

Therefore, Guo Jia actually preferred a ruined garden with family gathered around.

At Ning’s residence, Ning Yao was still in closed-door cultivation.

Pei Qian was consulting Bai Grandma about boxing techniques.

Zhong Qiu was practicing his stance, honing his fist techniques with the abundant sword intent in the air.

Cao Qinglang was in meditation.

Cui Dongshan was drinking with Nalan Laoge.

After Chen Pingan left Guo Jia and Yuhu Street, he went to a growing tavern. As usual, the shopkeeper didn’t compete for space with customers, simply squatting by the roadside to drink. Unfortunately, Fan Dache was quite inconsiderate, having drunk up all the leftover drink money from the little summer coins, leaving Chen Pingan to settle the bill with the young man Jiang Qu.

Jiang Qu mustered his courage and said he had recently received an advance on his salary from Sister Diezhang and could treat Mr. Chen to a pot of Bamboo Sea Cave wine, but Chen Pingan declined, saying it wasn’t that he didn’t want to, but he was afraid. He didn’t want any blemishes on his excellent reputation at Sword Qi Great Wall. As a scholar, how could he not cherish his reputation?

Jiang Qu continued to attend to the customers, thinking that Mr. Chen, who didn’t care for his reputation so much, didn’t seem right either.

After enjoying his drink leisurely, Chen Pingan had two bowls of wine with his companions before getting up to inspect the new two walls, looking over all the names and contents of the “no business” plaques.

He then carried a small stool to the street corner, vigorously waving a vibrant green bamboo branch as if he were a storyteller beneath the town bridge, calling out to attract an audience.

Feng Kangle was the first to rush over, forgetting to pick up the increasingly heavy clay pot. The child whispered in the ear of the second shopkeeper, explaining his difficulties, hoping the shopkeeper would pick up on the hint and avoid saying anything wrong. Chen Pingan smiled and nodded, in return asking Feng Kangle to run through the streets to help attract listeners. Having received his promise, the second shopkeeper guaranteed he wouldn’t expose Chen Pingan’s secret, and Feng Kangle patted the shopkeeper’s shoulder, giving him a thumbs up, saying he was a good brother with loyalty.

Chen Pingan glanced at Feng Kangle, who quickly patted the shopkeeper’s shoulder again, then began running and shouting for people, announcing that the story of the scholar beating the drum to plead his case at the City God Pavilion was about to start.

Once the storyteller saw that he was surrounded by people, he swiped some sunflower seeds from a nearby girl and began telling the tale of how the mountain god bullied men and forced women to marry beautiful brides, and how the scholar faced many hardships but ultimately achieved a happy ending.

However, when it came to the part where the mountain god was arrogant and powerful, and after hearing the scholar’s plea, the City God hesitated, the children grew unhappy and began to stir up trouble.

“Why did it take so long? Just the names of the visiting deities, the civil and military judges, the Iron Chain General, and their accomplishments in life, and how they became city gods after death, and what was written on the plaque—so much of this was discussed, yet in the end, the second shopkeeper only came out with this: that the City God, who had such a strong underling, was unwilling to seek justice for the poor scholar?”

Chen Pingan noticed that he had finished the sunflower seeds in his hand and turned to ask the girl for more, but unexpectedly, she turned around and, for the first time, refused to give him any.

Feng Kangle, not caring whether the second shopkeeper would expose him, said he hadn’t dared to knock on the door and meet anyone, then punched Chen Pingan, angrily exclaiming, “This won’t do! Either tell the ending directly, or just switch to a more straightforward new story! Otherwise, I’ll never come again, and you can just sit here drinking in the wind!”

The other children nodded in agreement.

It was clear that those sword immortals who drank had better taste; the second shopkeeper truly had a dark heart.

Such a frustrating and unsatisfying water-and-mountain story was hardly worth listening to.

The second shopkeeper raised the bamboo branch with one hand, pinched his fingers together, and performed a flourish as if it were a sword flower, shaking it a few times before asking, “Last time when I mentioned the City God’s temple, does anyone remember the half-told couplet on the main gate?”

A boy answered, “It’s ‘Seeking a good heart to guide me, to be a good person. By day, in the vastness of the world, one remains upright and safe; by night, on a bed, one’s soul rests and dreams are steady.’”

Chen Pingan laughed and nodded.

The boy asked, “Earlier, I asked you why you didn’t mention the other half, and you only said that the secrets of heaven shouldn’t be leaked. You shouldn’t be keeping secrets now, right?”

Chen Pingan replied, “If I keep a secret again, don’t rush me. Allow me to continue telling this far from finished story. Just then, in the City God’s temple, there was a profound silence. The City God stroked his beard and didn’t dare to speak, while the civil and military judges and day-and-night visiting deities were all speechless. At that moment, dark clouds suddenly obscured the moon, and with no money to light lamps, the moon in the sky also dimmed. The scholar looked around, filled with despair, feeling as if the sky was collapsing and the earth was splitting. He believed he was destined to be unable to save the woman he loved, feeling that life was worse than death, and thought about crashing to his death, unwilling to gaze upon the sordid affairs of the world any longer.”

The children listening were on the edge of their seats, their hearts aching for the scholar.

What was truly going on in the Great Harmony World?

Now that there were so many listeners, the second shopkeeper was only embarrassing Feng Kangle. How could he continue mingling in the rivers and lakes like this? This was what the second shopkeeper himself said: the rivers and lakes were divided into large and small; one should first take care of their own small rivers and lakes before venturing into larger ones.

Chen Pingan slapped his knee, “At the most critical moment, unexpectedly, at that very moment when the scholar’s life hung in the balance, a small light suddenly appeared outside the City God’s temple. It was tiny, tiny. The City God suddenly looked up, laughed heartily, and exclaimed, ‘My friend has arrived! This matter is not difficult!’ With a beaming smile, the City God stepped around the scholar’s desk, walked down the steps, and when he brushed past the scholar, he whispered a word. The scholar was skeptical but followed the City God out of the grand hall. Good viewers, do you know who the visitor was? Was it the mountain god who committed evil coming to punish the scholar? Or was it someone else arriving, leading to a twist of fate? To know how this matter unfolds, let’s listen…”

The little girl suddenly reached out her hand and handed the storyteller a handful of sunflower seeds, saying, “Don’t save it for next time; say it today! We have plenty of seeds left!”

The boy who had recited half of the City God’s temple couplet angrily said, “Don’t ask him; he’ll say what he wants. Once this story is over, I’m never coming again.”

The storyteller took the sunflower seeds from the little girl’s hand and brushed the bamboo branch vigorously. “Upon closer inspection, in an instant, that tiny light grew increasingly bright. Not only that, but soon more lights appeared, one by one, gathering together like a new bright moon. These lights cut through the night sky, breaking through the cloud sea, like an immortal walking the path, higher than the five mountains. On the ground, the practitioners, common folk, and even the wild dragons and snakes all woke from their dreams, stepping out of their doors and looking up, and oh, what a sight!”

At this point, the storyteller quickly started cracking sunflower seeds. “Don’t rush me, don’t rush me; let me crack a few seeds first.”

After cracking a few seeds, Chen Pingan continued, “The closer he got to the City God’s temple, the louder the scholar heard the thunderous sounds, like gods beating drums overhead. He was worried that the City God was in cahoots with the mountain god, but a glimmer of hope rose in his heart; perhaps in this vast universe, there was someone willing to help him seek justice. Even if he ultimately couldn’t obtain it, he would feel satisfied, for in the end, the world’s paths were not all rough, and there were those who, with their hearts, could comfort his spirit.”

Everyone around the small stool held their breath, listening intently.

“The scholar could not help but raise a hand to shield his eyes; the light was so bright that even an ordinary scholar could not bear to look any longer. Not only could the scholar not see, but even the City God and his officials found it too bright to look directly at the great light that filled the world. Just how bright was it? It illuminated the City God’s temple and the surrounding area for hundreds of miles, as if a great sun hung in the sky. How could a small mountain god have such a grandiose display?!”

Feng Kangle tentatively asked, “Could it be a passing sword immortal?”

The little girl sitting next to Feng Kangle nodded vigorously, “Definitely! Mr. Chen has said that those sword immortals are all clear-hearted, and their swords shine brightly.”

Chen Pingan responded, “Correct! It was indeed a sword immortal coming down from the mountains to travel the rivers and lakes! But it wasn’t just any sword immortal. The first to arrive was a young sword immortal in white robes, who landed gracefully at the City God’s temple, sheathed his flying sword, and stood there gracefully. Coincidentally, this person’s surname was Feng, and his name was Kangle; he was a newly famous sword immortal known for his chivalry, wandering the world with a sword at his side, and a small pot dangling from his waist that clinked as he walked. However, what was inside that pot remained a mystery. Then, as luck would have it, beside this sword immortal was a beautiful female sword immortal named Shu Xin, who, whenever she descended the mountain, would tuck some sunflower seeds in her sleeves. It turned out that she would eat some seeds after settling an injustice she encountered.”

Feng Kangle was stunned, and once he came back to his senses, he straightened his back, nearly bursting into tears from excitement, exclaiming, “This story is truly amazing!”

The girl named Shu Xin turned a bit red, feeling shy and guilty, realizing she had brought too few sunflower seeds today.

The storyteller continued, “Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh! More sword immortals descended, each one graceful, some with looks like jade crowns, others with a shocking presence; the female sword immortals were either like flowers or full of vigor. Even the City God, who had some knowledge of the situation but wasn’t fully aware, was startled, and the other officials and ghost messengers were even more shaken, bowing and greeting, not daring to look up. They were all dumbstruck, wondering… why were there so many sword immortals appearing at once? Among those renowned sword immortals, besides Feng Kangle and Shu Xin, there were also Zhou Shuiteng, Zhao Yusan, Ma Xiang’er…”

A long list of names was mentioned, and during this time, the storyteller glanced at a child whose name he didn’t know; the child anxiously shouted, “My name is Shi Tan!”

The storyteller added Shi Tan to the list of sword immortals.

When the named Zhao Yusan heard his name, he grinned but quickly returned to a serious expression.

If the next story included the sword immortal Zhao Yusan, he would listen; if not, he wouldn’t.

How could he know if there would be a similarly named sword immortal Zhao Yusan? The boy named Zhao Yusan had to first hear the next story before knowing for sure.

In reality, the story continued to unfold, and the children continued to pick and choose, listening to what they liked and wanted to hear.

Regardless, not a single person left the stool or the distance after the story concluded. They stayed, which was quite rare. 

However, this time, the storyteller didn’t say anything beyond the story. He simply looked at them and smiled, “The story is just a story. The tales in books are not merely tales on paper; you all have your own stories. The further you go, the more so. In the future, I won’t come here to be a storyteller. I hope one day you’ll come and tell me your stories.”

Chen Pingan stood up with the small stool.

A child timidly asked, “Mr. Chen, are you going back to your hometown?”

Chen Pingan shook his head and smiled, “No, I’ll stay here. However, I’m not just a storyteller deceiving people nor a bookkeeper making money, so I have many things of my own to attend to.”

After Chen Pingan left, he walked for a while and suddenly turned around with a smile, “To know how things will unfold…”

Many children who had already stood up burst into laughter, while only a few echoed him, but their voices were not soft, “Let’s listen next time!”

Chen Pingan chuckled softly to himself, muttering, “There will be more next time, just wait.”

Pei Qian practiced her punches diligently, just like the bamboo tower at Fallen Mountain back in the day, fearing that one day her master would suddenly send her away. Fallen Mountain was wonderful, but without her master around, it wasn’t quite the same.

Today, Bai Grandma seemed reluctant to exert herself during training, perhaps because she hadn’t eaten enough.

But Pei Qian didn’t mind because she felt she was about to break through the fourth realm bottleneck! This made Pei Qian overjoyed, laughing so widely that her mouth couldn’t close, chatting with Bai Grandma about many things.

Pei Qian believed she could finally stay at Sword Qi Great Wall for a few more days with confidence. Little did she expect that before she could share her good news with her master, he would lead Cui Dongshan down from the Dragon-slaying Terrace pavilion and come to the martial arts arena, saying they could set off back to their hometown now, right away.

Pei Qian looked at the big white goose, which shook its head helplessly; there was nothing to be done. Her master had made up his mind, and little senior brother couldn’t change it.

Pei Qian didn’t throw a tantrum, fearing and unwilling to do so, quietly following her master to pack her belongings at her residence, readying her small book box and grabbing her hiking staff.

In the middle of winter, why would they leave when the sun was so bright? It would be better if a heavy rain came, allowing them to leave Ning’s residence a bit later, even hiding from the rain at the gate for a while.

Cao Qinglang also held a hiking staff and carried a package, appearing at the door of the residence alongside Zhong Qiu.

Chen Pingan left with them from Ning’s residence, walking all the way to the grand gate where an elderly female crown and a senior sword immortal were stationed.

However, Cui Dongshan went to another place halfway, saying he was meeting up with someone at the Stork’s Nest Inn at Upside-down Mountain.

Chen Pingan stopped, “I won’t be seeing you off; be careful on the way.”

Pei Qian hung her head.

Cao Qinglang delivered a seal from his master, and Chen Pingan accepted it with a smile.

Pei Qian lifted her head and softly said, “Master, I left some things on the table at my master’s place, remember to tell her when she comes out.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I won’t forget. When we return to Fallen Mountain, tell Nuan Shu and Mi Li about the Sword Qi Great Wall. Don’t just boast about yourself, tell them everything that needs to be told.”

Pei Qian’s eyes turned red as she nodded, “I’ll do as you say, Master.”

It was strange; it had always been her staying behind to send her master off on distant journeys, but this time, it was her master staying behind to send her away.

It made her even sadder.

In the future, would she still need to leave Fallen Mountain alone to wander the rivers and lakes? Leaving her master all alone on Fallen Mountain would be so pitiful.

Chen Pingan turned to look back; a small girl came rushing over.

Pei Qian finally felt a bit happier, thinking if this little junior sister dared not come to see her, she would have lost out greatly.

Guo Zhujiu suddenly stopped, then jumped over to Pei Qian’s side, her smile radiant, “Little senior sister, you’re leaving with Master! Cry, quickly! Once you’ve cried, you can relax because I’ll be around to take care of Master!”

Pei Qian felt she couldn’t even bring herself to cry, so she took the actually empty small book box and handed it to Guo Zhujiu, saying, “Just remember, this is a loan from me, not a gift. When we meet next time, you can’t return it to me in tatters; it must be in perfect condition! If you don’t agree, I won’t even lend it to you!”

Guo Zhujiu snatched the small book box and directly slung it onto her back, nodding vigorously, “Little senior sister, you can rest assured! The small book box looks better on me! If it could speak, it would definitely be laughing so hard right now, having so much fun!”

Pei Qian extended her hand, “Give it back to me.”

Guo Zhujiu ignored her and instead asked, “Little senior sister, lend me your hiking staff too! The small book box and the hiking staff would be a perfect match! I’ll definitely carry the small book box on my back every day, wielding the hiking staff, poking at every stone slab and muddy road until I’ve covered every inch!”

Pei Qian felt wronged; having already lent her the small book box, now she wanted more? Was this how a little junior sister should behave? So she immediately turned to look at her master.

Chen Pingan chuckled, “You can meet Guo Zhujiu next time, return her the small book box, and then lend her the hiking staff.”

Pei Qian raised an eyebrow at Guo Zhujiu.

Guo Zhujiu nodded, “That works too.”

Then Guo Zhujiu pulled Pei Qian aside, and the two girls began whispering. Guo Zhujiu presented Pei Qian with a small wooden box, saying it was a gift from the little junior sister to the big senior sister as a token of respect. Pei Qian didn’t dare to accept it recklessly, so she turned to look at her master, who smiled and nodded.

Chen Pingan said to Zhong Qiu, “Mr. Zhong, once you return to the Great Harmony World, there’s no need to rush back to the Treasure Bottle Continent. You can take them to tour South Posa Continent for a while. I have a friend named Liu Xianyang, who is currently studying under the Chen family in Chunjun. However, Cui Dongshan likely won’t be accompanying you; he has many matters to attend to in his hometown. Once you reach Upside-down Mountain, borrow some celestial money from him; the journey of learning and exploration is wonderful, but just sightseeing won’t do.”

Zhong Qiu smiled, “I’ve already borrowed from him once; what’s the harm in borrowing again?”

Chen Pingan said, “During this trip, I didn’t give much thought to Mr. Zhong’s martial arts cultivation at Sword Qi Great Wall; I’m sorry about that.”

Zhong Qiu shook his head, “Such politeness is unnecessary; please refrain from saying it in the future.”

Chen Pingan didn’t say any more polite words.

In the end, Zhong Qiu remarked, “No matter how good the reasoning is, there are times when it’s not applicable. It’s not that the reasoning itself is wrong, but people have too many difficulties and unexpected events. Clearly, the same rice nourishes a hundred varieties of people, yet in the end, how many truly like that bowl of rice, and how many have genuinely thought about what that bowl of rice tastes like?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I’ll think more about it.”

Zhong Qiu hesitated to say something, wanting to offer words of comfort, but looking at this young man in the green shirt, he felt it unnecessary, so he refrained.

Pei Qian softly called out to her master but found herself unable to speak.

Guo Zhujiu, carrying the small book box, began counting with her fingers, likely trying to see when her big senior sister would start crying.

Pei Qian, noticing Guo Zhujiu’s actions from the corner of her eye, no longer felt sad; this little girl was truly annoying.

Cao Qinglang bid farewell to Mr. Chen with a bow.

Chen Pingan waved gently, then folded his hands in his sleeves.

After seeing them off, Chen Pingan escorted Guo Zhujiu to the grand city gate, before he himself took a symbolic boat to the city wall.

On the city wall, Zuo You asked, “Have they all left?”

Chen Pingan nodded.

Zuo You frowned, “Speak plainly.”

Chen Pingan felt nostalgic for the times when Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang were present; his senior brother would be more courteous to him then.

Chen Pingan spoke quietly, “If I wish for my senior brother to agree to leave Sword Qi Great Wall, I shouldn’t have rejected the great sword immortal. I should have agreed to light my life lamp at the Zushi Hall in Fallen Mountain. This way, my senior brother wouldn’t have to worry about me staying here.”

Zuo You said, “You’re only saying half of it? Who taught you this, our master?! The great sword immortal has already told me everything. The speed of my sword drawing is something you wouldn’t even fathom; no matter how hard you think, you won’t come up with it. Who gave you the courage to think about these random things? Didn’t you tell Yu Jianfu that reasoning is only for others? The principles in your heart are incredibly difficult to obtain; they’re not like the shop’s wine or the folding fans, which you can sell for money anytime. Such nonsense reasoning, I think it’s better for you not to learn it.”

Chen Pingan was momentarily left speechless.

His senior brother usually didn’t say much to him, but today he spoke so much, clearly quite upset with him.

It didn’t matter.

Chen Pingan had a plan. “Even if my master is busy now, with Pei Qian and Cao Qinglang at Fallen Mountain, he’ll surely visit often. I believe my senior brother’s disciples will tell him everything, and when my master hears it, he’ll definitely be happy.”

Now it was Zuo You’s turn to be left speechless.

Chen Pingan changed the subject, asking, “In the Wilderness World, are there still many people who haven’t forgotten about Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Zuo You nodded, “Of course. But they are still of little use.”

Chen Pingan inquired, “The two sages of Confucianism and Buddhism are stationed at the ends of the city wall, along with the sage of Daoism at the sky curtain, all to maintain Sword Qi Great Wall as much as possible, preventing it from being corroded or transformed by the aura of the Wilderness World?”

Zuo You replied, “For the three sage practitioners, it’s not an easy task. That Confucian sage who was once a Buddhist disciple lost a debate to our master and went to the Sub-Sage lineage, which is profound in knowledge. So, don’t think that the Sub-Sage lineage is unworthy. As scholars, we fear losing our own interests, which can lead to frustrations and resentment towards everything. And don’t think that just because there’s a gentleman like Wang Zai in the Li Sheng lineage, all the students of the Li Sheng lineage are gentlemen and virtuous people.”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “I wouldn’t let a single leaf block my view of the mountains.”

Zhong Ye, the gentleman from Tong Ye Continent, was from the Sub-Sage lineage.

Zuo You asked, “What did Cui Dongshan say before he left?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “Just trivial matters.”

Zuo You remained silent for a long time before slowly saying, “Back then, besides our master, no one saw Cui Zhan when he was young. The few of us who did see him found him to be quite similar to your current age.”

Chen Pingan suddenly said, “I still believe this world will get better and better.”

Zuo You smiled, “As it should be.”

Chen Pingan turned and said, “Senior brother, if you could smile more often, you’d be far more handsome than Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple.”

Zuo You retorted, “Isn’t it just as good not to smile?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “I think so; just don’t know how Wei Jin feels about it.”

Zuo You replied, “I’ll ask him about it later.”

Chen Pingan added, “It still depends on how sincerely Wei Jin answers the question.”

Zuo You nodded, “That’s reasonable.”

The two brothers gazed into the distance together.

Familiar faces each journeying afar.

Just like today, Chen Pingan was like this.

Just like not long ago, Qi Jinglong had left with Bai Shou and some young sword cultivators from Taihui Sword Sect, having already departed from Sword Qi Great Wall.

The common people below the mountain were the same, and the immortals above the mountain were no exception.

Once again, another year had passed at Sword Qi Great Wall, and spring was blossoming anew.

This time, Ning Yao’s closed-door cultivation seemed to forget the changing seasons; this was, in fact, the most common way of cultivating.

Fan Dache still hadn’t broken through, but his foundation in the Dragon Gate realm was getting better, and he had thoroughly mingled with Ning’s and Yan’s families.

Yan Zhuo had now gained the full support of his family’s chief offering, greatly improving his sword skills.

Chen Sanqiu remained the same, a drunken playboy, always feeling the walls were coming to support him.

Dong Huafu still bought things without spending money wherever he went.

The business at Diezhang Tavern remained excellent, and the number of “no business” plaques kept increasing.

It was said that Qi Shou had gone into closed-door cultivation, and his chances of becoming a Yuanying sword cultivator upon exiting were greatly promising.

Pang Yuanji often visited Diezhang Tavern to buy wine because the tavern had introduced a new type of wine, extremely strong and potent, but it was a bit pricey; one pot of wine required three snowflake coins. However, the Bamboo Sea Cave wine at one snowflake coin not only didn’t have reduced sales but was selling even more. Pang Yuanji didn’t lack money, and his sword immortal friend Gao Kui also loved this drink, so Pang Yuanji felt he was single-handedly supporting half of the tavern’s business for the strong wine. Unfortunately, the tavern’s owner, Diezhang girl, had learned the second shopkeeper’s true teachings and was becoming increasingly thrifty, unwilling to discount a single snowflake coin even for bulk purchases, and she would even complain about Pang Yuanji buying so much, asking what the other sword immortals would do. She was willing to sell the wine, but it seemed Pang Yuanji owed her a favor.

Pang Yuanji was quite troubled. He could drink any wine, but now Gao Kui was addicted to drink yet had no money. Gao Kui was nurturing his life-bound flying sword, and when he reached a critical juncture, he suddenly changed from a rich man with deep pockets to a poverty-stricken fool. This was a common occurrence at Sword Qi Great Wall; when one had money, they truly had plenty to spare, but when they were out of cash, not a single copper coin would remain, and they had to scramble to borrow money.

However, Pang Yuanji was currently most interested in when the stinky tofu would be sold.

The help at the tavern had, for some reason, changed; the two boys from Lingxi Alley and Suolisi Alley weren’t working there anymore, replaced by three new faces—a boy, a girl, and a dark-skinned child. They were all neighbors of the tavern’s owner, Diezhang, but it was the youngest one who was surprisingly nimble. The drunken gamblers liked to tease this little one because, despite her young age, she had quite a temper. No matter whether you were a sword immortal or not, if you dared to borrow money, you’d have no chance; if you dared to grab extra pickles or ask for extra noodles, you’d get the cold shoulder. Pickles would still be served at the table or brought to the roadside, but the child wouldn’t give a pleasant face.

From last winter to this spring, the second shopkeeper had stayed hidden and almost never appeared. Only Guo Zhujiu visited frequently, so she could occasionally see her master. When they met, she would ask when her big senior sister would return; by now, the small book box had developed feelings for her, and the next time she met her big senior sister, the book box would surely speak up, saying it had grown tired of home and didn’t want to return.

At Ning’s residence, Nalan Ye Xing was somewhat anxious, proactively asking Bai Lianshuang, “Is this method of practicing swordsmanship for my brother-in-law too hasty? Is there really no problem?” Nalan Ye Xing couldn’t bear to draw his sword.

Bai Grandma was also anxious, but the young lady was in closed-door cultivation. Who could she ask? So she told Nalan Ye Xing to go to the city wall to find her brother-in-law’s senior brother.

Nalan Ye Xing thought it made sense and went over. As it turned out, his brother-in-law’s senior brother was even harsher, saying, “If you, Nalan, feel that your little junior brother is delaying your return to the immortal realm by practicing swordsmanship with you, just let him come to the city wall to practice instead.”

Nalan Ye Xing left the city wall with a dark face. Bai Grandma was waiting at the entrance, and upon hearing those irritating words from Zuo You, she nearly couldn’t help but go to the city wall. It took a lot of persuasion to stop Nalan Ye Xing.

After the persuasion, Nalan Ye Xing secretly felt pleased, having been called “Nalan Senior” by Zuo You. He felt good and went to drink, thinking the next time his brother-in-law called him to practice swordsmanship, he wouldn’t be kind, getting drunk and losing control over the flying sword’s power.

After several rounds of big and small spring rains, the heat began to rise in the world.

On this day, Chen Pingan sat alone in a pavilion, hands in his sleeves, leaning against the pavilion column, napping in the breeze.

On the city wall, Zuo You opened his eyes and stood up, reaching for his sword’s hilt, squinting into the distance.

South of the city wall, yellow sand stretched for miles, blocking the sky and the sun, surging towards the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Grains of sand rolled like a tide, even higher than the Sword Qi Great Wall, crashing against it.

The monks and Confucian sages at both ends of the Sword Qi Great Wall simultaneously reached out their palms, lightly pressing down on the white mist.

A Taoist sage, holding a snow-white whisk, sat cross-legged at a high point. When the old man looked up, the cloud sea beneath him opened layer by layer.

A child, resembling a girl with ram’s horns, had been yawning and dazing at a jar of unopened wine on the city wall. Now, she excitedly rolled over a few times, bouncing up, her eyes sparkling with joy, shouting in a childish voice, “All those below the Jade Purity realm, leave the city wall! The northern borders are enough; come join the fun!”

Chen Qingdu slowly walked out of his thatched hut, hands clasped behind his back, coming over to Zuo You’s side. He leaped lightly onto the wall, smiling as he asked, “Is the sword Qi saved for meals?”

Zuo You remained silent, though he didn’t draw his sword, he no longer strained to contain his sword Qi, stepping forward.

Outside the Sword Qi Great Wall, the yellow sand hit an invisible wall and instantly turned to powder, unable to approach the city wall.

Not only that, but that intangible sword Qi city wall continued to push south, causing the rolling yellow sand to retreat for several dozen miles.

Eventually, the world returned to clarity, and the view opened wide, revealing everything.

In the northern city, brilliant sword lights soared, all sheathing their swords atop the southern city wall.

At last, on the city wall of Sword Qi Great Wall.

Sword immortals gathered like clouds.

 **Chapter 721: The Fourteen Thrones, I, the Dragon, Raise My Head**

The great sword immortal, Yue Qing, donned a robe crafted by a clothing shop, with the sword “Xiong Zhen Wu Yue” hanging from his waist. However, compared to this semi-divine weapon that rarely left its sheath, Yue Qing actually preferred the long sword forged by the sword workshop. Thus, the sword he currently leaned on was indeed a product of that very workshop. Many sword immortals and earth immortals in the Sword Qi Great Wall still favored the style of wearing robes from clothing shops and using swords crafted by workshops, a trend greatly influenced by Yue Qing himself.

The female sword immortal, Zhou Cheng, was still swinging on a swing. Long ago, a young man who said he wanted to take a glance at his hometown ended up dying at the hands of those he called his fellow countrymen—all for her sake. Zhou Cheng bore no sword; instead, the golden threads of sword intent, passed down through generations in her sect, danced around her like unsheathed swords.

The youthful and handsome Yu Pu realm sword immortal, Wu Chengpei, had red-rimmed eyes and a twisted expression. Today, there were particularly many great demons, both familiar and unfamiliar faces alike.

On one side stood the sword immortal Yuan Qingshu from Southern Po Sha Continent alongside the local sword immortal Gao Kui. Gao Kui wore a serious expression as he shared tales of the legendary origins of the great demons with Yuan Qingshu. This was an unprecedented gathering of great demons that had been lurking in the wild for countless years, all converging on the southern battlefield. Especially concerning the fourteen great demons at the forefront of the southern lands, they were among the most prominent figures in the early editions of the “Bai Ze Map” and “Mountain Search Map.” Later editions published by the righteous world would no longer record their existence. Even Gao Kui admitted he had never seen them alive until now. This time, the wild world had gathered them all at once, making things more convenient.

Yuan Qingshu took a sip from a sword-raising gourd while Gao Kui recounted the ancient origins of each great demon. With each mention, Yuan Qingshu took a sip of wine, enjoying the excellent taste that matched the name of the great demon.

Han Huai, the sect master of the Taihui Sword Sect, closed his eyes to cultivate his spirit, occasionally tapping lightly on the hilt of his sword. Beside him stood Li Cai, the sect master of the Floating Duck Sword Lake, who appeared equally from North Julu Continent.

Li Cai’s eyes sparkled—what a gathering of formidable fighters!

There were two figures, less resembling sword immortals and more like wandering fishermen and woodcutters, traveling friends from the snowy continent: the sword immortals Zhang Shao and Li Ding. Initially somewhat heavy-hearted, they exchanged glances and shared a knowing smile, both having made up their minds to face death.

Zhao Ge Yi sat in place, glancing back. The one who should have been sitting on the northern city wall was Cheng Quan, who had been gravely injured by a great demon and had fallen to the realm of Nascent Soul, a pitiful state. Since he was no longer a top five realm sword cultivator, he could only curse and leave. Zhao Ge Yi retracted his gaze and laughed heartily. He and Cheng Quan had always competed over everything since childhood—higher realms, better flying swords, greater killing power, and even the favor of a beloved woman. Cheng Quan had often come out on top. But now? Not only had his realm surpassed Cheng Quan’s, but as for rushing to die first, Cheng Quan, the mere Nascent Soul, wouldn’t have a chance. “I’ll go see her first—let's see how furious you get, Cheng Quan.”

Nalan Yexing felt somewhat irritated. Couldn’t these beasts from the wild world wait a moment longer before seeking death? If he could return to the immortal realm, then those beasts would die under his flying sword, wouldn’t they die more satisfying deaths?

Yet, Nalan Yexing was also puzzled. The opposing forces seemed somewhat strange. In the past, armies would fill the skies like locusts and cover the ground like ants, yet now they had yet to fully gather. Were the wild world’s great demons really planning to attack the city with just these lone warriors? The wine from his father-in-law’s tavern hadn’t even reached the wild world yet—how had these great demons gone mad?

Han Huai smiled slightly, his expression carefree and spirited. “After this battle, the Taihui Sword Sect will have no regrets.”

The Hidden Official rubbed his hands in anticipation, occasionally wiping the corner of his mouth as he muttered, “It’s clear they’re preparing for a real fight. If we get through this, as long as we don’t die, not only can we drink, but we’ll definitely drink to our fill.”

One sword immortal squatted at the edge of the wall, tracing the contours with a detached expression, tinged with a faint nostalgia for life and death. 

Another sword immortal uncorked a jug of wine, murmuring a chant before slowly pouring out all the wine, then casually tossed the jug over the city wall.

The old deaf man wore an expressionless face, merely wondering when he could leave the city wall and retreat to his little nest; the wind up here was a bit too strong.

Mi Hu’s expression was grave; this time, it could be said that the newcomers were exceptionally unfriendly.

The immortal realm’s Li Tui chuckled bitterly, “Great, this time, it’s not just the chubby young master Yan who gets fattened for the feast—looking at their demeanor, I’m on the menu too.”

On the vast lands south of the city wall, a row of fourteen seats lined up, each varying in height and size, resembling the most bizarre ancestral hall in the world.

This setup differed significantly from the ancestral hall seats of the righteous world.

Aside from the fourteen unfamiliar great demons, the remaining so-called great demons, familiar faces from the Sword Qi Great Wall over the past hundred years, seemed less significant. Originally, each of these prominent figures attracted the most attention and drew the most flying swords on the battlefield, but now they all obediently stood behind that line.

This was the wild world’s rule—simple, brutal, and direct, even more straightforward than that of the Sword Qi Great Wall. As for the righteous world, which loved to beat around the bush, they couldn’t compare.

Chen Qingdu stood with his hands behind his back and chuckled softly, “With sword techniques this high, just looking at this scene before us is enough to take one’s breath away. I feel like any casual sword strike can hit its mark. What do you think?”

“Whenever I strike, I never think so much,” replied the one next to him while gripping his long sword.

Chen Qingdu glanced toward the southern horizon. True to form, the master of the world didn’t make his presence known actively; only from a distance could one truly notice him.

Chen Qingdu then withdrew his gaze, looking at those making a grand entrance. Some were familiar acquaintances, having survived through various strokes of luck—escaping quickly, being tough-skinned, or other such fortune—yet they had not been slain by him. However, that was long ago, and whether there would be future stories about them was hard to say.

Once, he had predicted that consolidating half the wild world’s fighting strength could consume a Sword Qi Great Wall, and it wasn’t just empty threats.

That was the truth.

However, these demons—young and old—loved to squabble amongst themselves. Along with that old fellow who kept dying and not dying, appearing and disappearing, without a leading figure to truly restrain Chen Qingdu, they ultimately became scattered sand. Many times, when victory seemed assured in a siege battle, they would suffer some minor injuries and losses, leading to great demons taking the initiative to retreat, leading their tribes back to recuperate, or being killed deep in enemy lines by great sword immortals, leaving the remaining great demons busy devouring the power of their fallen comrade, completely ignoring the Sword Qi Great Wall, which had become a tasteless prize.

Thus, in history, there had been only one time, arguably the most dangerous one, when that hall of the wild world’s heroic spirits—Chen Qingdu’s so-called mouse nest—saw nearly half of the thrones occupied by their respective masters, each pledging oaths and dividing benefits. That was the war that could truly be termed tragic; if Chen Qingdu remembered correctly, at that time, he was the only one left standing on the city wall, and the northern city nearly breached the array, completely cutting off the future of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

That time, many elders in the eyes of young sword cultivators perished, and many children in the eyes of young sword immortals met their end.

Chen Qingdu sighed and said slowly, “It’s time for a conclusion for the three parties.”

As a remnant of a prisoner for ten thousand years, it was time to settle accounts with himself.

**In the distant south.**

A shattered mountain hung upside down, countless massive rocks pierced by iron chains, resembling the upside-down mountain's appearance. The peak pointed to the ground, the base pointing to the sky. On the flat top of this inverted mountain, it gleamed like a mirror under the sunlight, dazzling like the world’s largest gold coin. A great demon, clad in a golden robe, was obscured from view.

The great demon reached out, grasping a handful of indistinct golden coins, but soon, the coins flowed through his fingers like water, ultimately insufficiently real. It needed the myriad mountain deities of the righteous world to complete it. Only then could this golden throne of his be truly worthy of its name. According to the agreement, the mountain deities’ golden fragments from the entire righteous world would belong to him upon his emergence. Unfortunately, it was not enough—far from enough. If he wanted to become an existence like the sun in the sky, transcending for millions of years, and truly become an immortal being, he would need to consume more, preferably the reincarnated forms of those legendary deities from the celestial court, to fill his belly!

High above, there was a vast palace made of jade and crystal, where a great demon in human form sat on the railing, seemingly guarding a vast fortune alone, gazing at the Sword Qi Great Wall. He had heard that beyond that city wall, further north, there was a Cloud-Stop Pavilion made of azure jade built by immortals, and on the nights of clear winds and bright moons, the sound of pines echoed from the myriad valleys, which could add some charm to his residence. However, these were merely appetizers; he desired to occupy the “ultimate achievement of the world” associated with the Chen family of Southern Po Sha, and to seize the ancient ascension platform from the small Baoling Continent, would also be quite satisfactory.

A gigantic divine corpse floated in the air, with a great demon perched atop its head. A long spear pierced through the skull of the divine corpse, the spear hidden, only the tip and tail visible. The spear’s tip emitted faint thunderous sounds, causing the entire corpse to tremble. The great demon gently tapped the spear’s tip, having heard that the cultivators of the righteous world excelled at the Five Thunder Techniques, especially those from the Dragon Tiger Mountain’s Heavenly Master’s Court in the Middle Earth Divine Continent.

There was a throne made of countless white bones, composed of hundreds of thousands of bones, both from demons and sword cultivators. A bloodless skeletal great demon, its body gleamed white as jade, stood on an ancient great sword immortal’s head. A demon holding a wine cup drank heartily, using its toes to play with the skull. No longer preoccupied with its own drinking, the great demon shifted its posture, tilting the wine cup as crimson wine poured over the skull. Moments later, the skull began to levitate, and as more wine spilled from the cup, flesh and bone slowly formed upon it, eventually becoming a one-zhang tall old man, his appearance indistinguishable from a human. The skeletal great demon shook its sleeves, releasing a flash of rainbow light, which the stiff and vacant-eyed old man grasped. In that instant, the dull-eyed elder transformed into a sword immortal, radiating an imposing aura.

There was a towering ancient pillar, engraved with lost runes, around which coiled a crimson long serpent, with lifeless dragon pearls swirling around it. The serpent hissed, fixating its gaze on the city wall, aiming to break through this ancient, rotten fence and shatter the inverted mountain. Its goal was singular: to finally complete the Great Dao, obtaining control over the rains and paths of the two worlds.

A tattered long robe gradually appeared, floating in the air, devoid of anything inside, billowing with the wind and rustling.

When this mysterious, ownerless robe emerged, ancient sword intent in the vicinity of the Sword Qi Great Wall surged joyfully as if meeting an old friend, while more sword intents wept, and countless sword intents grew increasingly restless, angrily denouncing the gray robe.

A stunning beauty with a kingly crown and black dragon robe, with a human head and serpent body, sat high upon a dragon chair the size of a mountain, her long serpent body dragging on the ground. Each time the tip of her tail lightly struck the earth, it caused a violent tremor within a hundred miles, raising dust clouds. Compared to her massive form, hundreds or thousands of tiny, graceful women, like celestial maidens in murals, danced with flowing ribbons, cradling pianos.

A small old man, suspended in the air while sword controlling, had arms as long as a monkey’s, shouldering a long staff, his hands resting casually on it. His hair and beard were entirely white, yet he wore black robes, spinning a long sword slowly. Occasionally, he would inhale, drawing in one or two of the piano women from the neighboring area, chewing and swallowing them. On one of his hands, he wore a string of prayer beads, which were rather rough, just a collection of stones of various sizes and sharp edges.

The woman in the dragon robe sitting on the dragon chair paid no mind, even waving her hand, sending over ten “serving girls” to the old man, allowing him to consume them to his heart's content.

There was a Daoist clad in white robes, floating in mid-air, his features blurred, towering three hundred zhang tall, yet he was not a Dharma form but his true body. Behind him hovered a crescent moon, seemingly plucked from the heavens and brought to the mortal realm.

A giant with three heads and six arms sat upon a colossal futon made of golden books. Even seated like this, he was still taller than the neighboring Daoist. A glaring scar, deep as a ravine, marked his chest, which he did not attempt to hide. The humiliation of this kind would only be righted when he could reclaim his honor.

At a great height, a well-groomed man with a long beard, a sword at his waist, and another sword on his back stood. Beside him was a young man bearing a sword rack, raggedly clad, with numerous swords stuck in the rack behind him, resembling a peacock displaying its feathers.

During the last secret meeting at the Hall of Heroic Spirits, he had received a decree but had not attended, refusing even to make an appearance, yet no one dared to say anything.

Higher up was a Confucian-clad man, sitting upright, smiling, with his hands folded over his abdomen, cradling a glowing orb the size of a fist, which flickered from white to black, then suddenly burst into brilliant colors.

A strikingly handsome young man occupied a position neither high nor low, having transformed into human form, matching the height of an ordinary person, yet upon closer inspection, his face was assembled from various pieces. At his waist hung an ancient sword-raising gourd, which contained the residual souls of sword immortals, along with many worn-out flying swords of his former disciples. He had not existed in the world for far too long, and the contents of the gourd came from generations of disciples who had worshipped him.

A burly man clad in golden armor stood firmly on the ground, his fists clenched, thick golden light oozing from the crevices of his armor. This suit of celestial armor, though fragmented, was not a treasure he donned voluntarily, but rather a cage resembling a small world.

Ten thousand years ago, the human race reached the peak, driving the demon race to the vast but barren wild lands, where sword cultivators were relocated to the Sword Qi Great Wall region to build fortifications. This became the so-called wild world, one of the divisions after humanity split into four. 

When the wild world first officially became “one world,” the heavens and earth were still taking shape, like a newborn—its Great Dao was still in its infancy and not yet stable. On the Sword Qi Great Wall side, there were three prisoner sword cultivators, led by Chen Qingdu, who sought the sword at Tuo Yue Mountain. Afterward, the demon ancestor vanished without a trace, leaving the many dragons without a head, forming the current standoff between the wild world and the Sword Qi Great Wall. The ancient well known as the Hall of Heroic Spirits served as a meeting place for great demons and had historically been a place of imprisonment. In truth, Tuo Yue Mountain was the first to resemble a secular royal palace. However, after the battle at Tuo Yue Mountain, Chen Qingdu returned alone to the Sword Qi Great Wall, and Tuo Yue Mountain, having been utterly destroyed, had to rebuild the “secondary capital,” the Hall of Heroic Spirits, for meetings. 

However, throughout the ten thousand-year history, the fourteen thrones had never been fully assembled; at most, six or seven would gather, which already counted as a significant event worthy of discussion among the wild world. The fewest would be two or three great demons who could make decisions and pledge oaths there.

After the sudden upheaval and a shocking battle, countless dragons and serpents rose from the mountains and plains, each claiming their territory. Among them, the golden armored man was the most outstanding figure. After the great war, the wild lands lost the only one capable of unifying the masses. He aimed to contend for the title of the world’s overlord. However, according to the rules, having lost at Tuo Yue Mountain, he was punished and imprisoned at the bottom of the ancient well in the Hall of Heroic Spirits by several great demons tasked with guarding Tuo Yue Mountain.

To his surprise, he devised a plan and connected with the outside world, finally managing to break free. Coincidentally, a young Daoist riding an ox traveled through the wild world and stood at the well’s edge, extending a finger to gently press the great demon, who had just escaped the depths of the well, back down into the bottom. One finger not only pressed him back into the depths of the prison but also poured down golden light, firmly trapping the high-ranking great demon. Fortunately, the great demon’s long life was far beyond ordinary humans raised by ancient deities. Once he chose to lie low and sleep, the passage of time had little effect on them. Thus, he finally endured until the elder reappeared, permitting him to atone for his sins.

**On the still horizontal line to the south.**

The inverted mountain, and the golden-robed great demon.

The great demon sitting on the railing of the jade palace seemed like the ancient immortal recorded in the texts of the righteous world.

The man atop the divine corpse’s head, with a long spear piercing through the skull, contained the purest essence of thunder law from the wild world.

Upon the throne of bones, he had transformed an ancient great sword immortal into a puppet returned to peak realm.

The scarlet serpent circling around the pillar seemed to be the master of all water gods in the wild world.

The Daoist in a white robe refined half of the essence of the moon from the wild world into his life object.

The giant with three heads and six arms had once been the first to ascend the Sword Qi Great Wall, enduring a strike from Chen Qingdu without dying. Now, he headed to the righteous world to shatter every piece of the ancestral hall’s territory, regardless of size.

The dragon-robed woman with the imperial crown aspired to become the overlord beneath the mountains of the nine continents of the righteous world, controlling the orderly flow of incense among mortals and the rebirth of deities. In exchange, she bestowed her river upon another peer-level great demon, thus ceasing to engage in the same world’s competition. Before this, neither side trusted one another, both wanting to devour the other. Now, it was different; they both had greater aspirations.

The owner of the tattered robe had once departed with Chen Qingdu from the Sword Qi Great Wall, one of the peers who questioned the sword at Tuo Yue Mountain, a close friend of that old great sword immortal.

The bearded man, standing beside his only disciple, had fought with A Liang before, drank with him, and on idle days, helped that old blind man move mountains.

The Confucian-clad man sought to return to the righteous world after humanity was thoroughly shattered, to reorganize the mountains and rivers, and enlighten the masses with his knowledge, teaching all without discrimination.

The great demon bound in golden armor for countless years sought not only to go to the righteous world but also to lead an army to the Azure Sky realm, to the White Jade Capital.

The old swordmaster aimed to refine all the renowned mountains of the righteous world into his own, and he wanted to personally shatter the nine great towers, then personally ask Bai Ze about his thoughts.

The handsome young man with the sword-raising gourd considered his ambitions minimal; he merely wished to gather all the beautiful faces of the righteous world. As for the cultivator women on the mountains, even if they lost their beauty, they could still live. But those unwilling to live without beauty would find countless ways to die awaiting them.

These fourteen great demons represented the pinnacle of the wild world today.

Most had been awakened from endless slumber.

Some, despite being awake, had remained in their nests during the long history, choosing to watch the battles of the Sword Qi Great Wall without intervening, rarely engaging in the siege occurring roughly once every hundred years.

The seats in the Hall of Heroic Spirits were not fixed, nor was the number constant. Some had fallen, causing their thrones to shatter and tumble into the well, while some younger ones had risen, able to take a seat in the Hall of Heroic Spirits. There was no hierarchy based on qualifications; those with higher strength had higher thrones, while the weaker had to look up at others. The history of the wild world was a tale of strong individuals stepping over the bones of ants, gradually climbing to achieve immortal feats, alongside the rise of numerous secular kingdoms comparable to the righteous world, standing tall on the land, establishing rules and rituals. However, in the end, their fates were not good; they could not endure the trampling of great demons who shifted from neutrality to hostility, and in the river of time, they forever shone briefly.

The ultimate pursuit of the wild world’s strong was unparalleled might. 

Beyond that, everything else was an illusion.

All internal strife, the ruin of countless demon clans, and the disappearance of innumerable ants were solid steps for a single powerful individual to ascend.

Then this small group of entities balanced one another to avoid mutual destruction, which was the only rule of this world. The existence of the Hall of Heroic Spirits, the rise and fall of each new and old throne in the ancient well, were all dictated by these rules.

The fourteen great demons suddenly descended.

From the central area, a gray-clad elder slowly emerged, holding a young child by the hand.

The child clutched the hair of a head, the man’s eyes wide open even in death, seemingly unafraid, yet there was an evident unquenched hatred lingering.

Behind the gray-clad elder and child followed a bowing and bending ascending realm great demon, responsible for overseeing the last siege battle, and it was this great demon, self-named Zhong Guang, who had been pursued by the new sword immortals on the city wall.

Zhong Guang naturally did not dare reveal his true form, strutting behind the gray-clad elder.

Once the gray-clad elder stopped, Zhong Guang, following the former's instructions, stepped forward and called out, “In the next great battle, any sword immortal who doesn’t strike with all their might shall die the day the Sword Qi Great Wall falls! Afterward, whether you wish to wander the wild world or enjoy the sights of the righteous world, you are free to come and go. As for the lower five realm sword cultivators on the city wall, those unwilling to draw their swords, who leave the city wall, are all esteemed guests of our wild world, honored guests!”

On the city wall, silence reigned.

Dong Sang sneered, “The upper five realm beasts from the south—whoever first ascends the city wall will die first.”

Zhong Guang turned his head; even if he wanted to speak harshly, it was not his place.

The gray-clad elder patted the child's head, “Go, you were once old acquaintances. Now, as a direct disciple of Tuo Yue Mountain, greet Chen Qingdu.”

The child, gripping the blood-dried head, slowly stepped forward, gaining speed as he approached, finally stopping firmly and throwing the head onto the ground.

The head belonged to a great sword immortal who had been hiding in the wild world for six hundred years. Not only was his swordsmanship high, but he also excelled at manipulating the relations among great demons, the many conflicts arising from his schemes.

Feeling somewhat wronged, the child turned and said, “Master, my realm is too low now; there are too many sword intents on the city wall. I can’t throw it onto the city wall!”

The gray-clad elder chuckled, “As long as your intent is there, it’s fine. Besides, those sword immortals’ gazes are quite good.”

The child grinned and shifted his gaze to the young man beside the bearded man, somewhat provocatively.

The young man remained silent, merely letting the numerous swords in his sword rack behind him unsheathe slightly.

The gray-clad elder looked up at the city wall, his eyes only on the old great sword immortal, Chen Qingdu.

Chen Qingdu stood with his hands behind his back, gazing down at the earth, locking eyes with him. Then he stretched out a hand, forcefully pulling a head from a body of an ascending realm great demon imprisoned to the north of the city wall, which he instantly held in his hand, smiling, “This head has been reserved for you for so many years, also a direct disciple of Tuo Yue Mountain.”

The gray-clad elder chuckled, “Chen Qingdu, it’s been ten thousand years; have you become this formidable?”

After a brief pause, the elder finally asked, “Shall we let you die again?”

Many foreign sword immortals on the city wall were left in confusion.

Chen Qingdu remarked, “No wonder you’ve harbored resentment for ten thousand years underground; it’s no wonder you speak with such audacity upon resurfacing.”

The gray-clad elder shook his head, “I’ve heard the new sword’s name is ‘Long Qi,’ not very capable—no, it’s far from capable.”

Chen Qingdu always kept his hands behind his back, smiling, “If you were a woman, you might have the ability to know whether I’m capable or not.”

Whistles rose from the city wall.

It seemed that not only the sword cultivators inside the city enjoyed this.

Indeed, sword immortals were quite similar.

The child returned to the gray-clad elder’s side, tugging at his master’s sleeve, “Those words are quite persuasive.”

The gray-clad elder was not the slightest bit angered, looking down at the disciple who had been diligently searching yet still lacked a complete soul, instead smiling, “These people, whether alive or dead, sword cultivators or not, are all best at the art of words. If you want to learn this lowest skill in the righteous world, feel free to learn.”

The great demon sitting on the railing of the immortal manor laughed, “You Chen Qingdu, truly embody respect, hatred, and pity—all in equal measure, but pity most of all. Keeping these great demons in custody yet not killing them, serving as a sharpening stone for sword immortals, and as products of that pill workshop, you must have been scolded mercilessly by the scholars of the righteous world, right? Holding the entire Sword Qi Great Wall here to await death, you must have been despised by your own people, haven’t you? Tell me, are you not pitiable? Having died once, you still have to endure being stabbed in the back. Chen Qingdu, oh Chen Qingdu, if I were you, I’d just die to find peace.”

Chen Qingdu didn’t even glance at the peak great demon.

Instead, he turned to those ethereal jade palaces, asking, “Do you think you’re qualified to speak with the old great sword immortal?”

The great demon laughed, “While it may be lacking in qualifications to speak with Chen Qingdu, talking with you should be more than enough.”

The child stepped forward again, finally reaching the head, stepping atop the great sword immortal’s head, looking up and laughing, “I’m twelve now. Aren’t there many geniuses in your Sword Qi Great Wall? Bring someone around my age out to battle with me! I won’t bully you; any sword cultivator under thirty will do. Remember to bring a few semi-divine weapons or treasures; otherwise, it won’t be much of a show!”

The old sword immortal Qi Tingji frowned, “This little brat hopes that Ning Yao will appear, offering a life for a life, wanting you to leave the city wall so that old thing can take advantage of the timing and location.”

Chen Qingdu nodded, smiling, “That’s the idea. But it doesn’t matter; if you can’t handle this level of provocation, how can you guard the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Chen Qingdu waved his hand.

A group of young people appeared behind him, more than ten in total, including Pang Yuanji, Chen Sanqiu, Dong Hua Fu, and others. 

Of course, there were also those who had come out of seclusion, like Ning Yao, and Chen Ping’an, who had originally been inside the pavilion at Zhanlong Cliff.

Chen Qingdu extended his arm, lifting the head, turning to smile, “Who will pay my respects on my behalf?”

Ning Yao stepped forward but was stopped by a hand on her shoulder.

Chen Ping’an said, “I’ll go.”

Chen Qingdu smiled cheerfully, “Aren’t you afraid of using your only chance like this? What about the next great battle?”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “We’ll talk about that when the time comes.”

Chen Qingdu casually tossed the head of the ascending realm great demon, “Let go of your hands and feet, and let’s have a proper fight.”

A figure in green robes leapt onto the city wall, then stepped into the air, running down the wall, suddenly coming to a halt as if rooted to the ground. He bent his knees slightly and with a bang, shot like an arrow towards the southern earth, catching the falling head with one hand and placing the other behind his back before finally landing on the ground.

On the ground, the child flicked his toes, pulling the dust-coated great sword immortal’s head into his hands as he walked forward slowly.

The two sides were about a hundred steps apart.

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Let’s decide the winner on the ground to see who takes a sword strike first, how about it?”

The gray-clad elder nodded, “Why not?”

On the field, the two sides faced off, the child grinning as he extended his hand.

Chen Ping’an directly threw the head of the great demon, and the child simultaneously raised his arm to casually toss the great sword immortal’s head high into the air.

The child didn’t reach out to catch the head of the Tuo Yue Mountain great demon but instead stepped on it, brushing the blood off his body, leaning forward with his arms crossed over his chest, “You look light, not worth hitting.”

The young man in the green robe caught the head, cradling it before his chest, gently wiping the face of the unknown great sword immortal, allowing it to close its eyes.

But just this action was a massive flaw.

After a punch from the child, the green-robed figure was sent staggering back for several dozen zhang, carving a not-so-deep trench into the ground, yet he remained standing firm.

The child stood where the young man had once been, nodding in satisfaction, “Not bad; we can play together a little longer.”

Chen Ping’an turned to look back, the head of the great sword immortal vanishing into thin air. The great sword immortal Yue Qing tucked the head under his arm, bowing with both hands to the young man.

The child laughed, “I’ve changed my mind. With so many seniors watching, it’s better to kill you sooner. If you strike first, this one chance will be yours; after that, I’ll use my full strength, and you’ll die very quickly, much faster than my original opponent, Ning Yao, and her useless parents.”

Chen Ping’an turned to face the child before bowing his head, rolling up his sleeves, the corners of his mouth curling up, the smile growing more abundant, his eyes growing more profound, his suppressed emotions surging forth. 

Thus, when he finally raised his head,

It was a young face twisted into a savage smile.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 722: Why So Talkative**

Those who have truly grasped the Great Way find a certain comfort in their existence; it seems as though there are no true separations of life and death. Whenever destiny beckons, long-lost acquaintances can reunite, regardless of the passage of time.

A thousand years? What does it matter when he sees Chen Qingdu again, and Chen Qingdu sees him?

The only difference is that he now stands on one bank of the river of time while Chen Qingdu stands on the other.

The child did not bother looking at the unknown young man nearby; instead, he lifted his gaze to the castle's parapet where an elderly man stood with his hands clasped behind his back—Chen Qingdu, the legendary Sword Immortal known as 'Old Big Sword Immortal.'

Ever since his enlightenment, both his master and senior brother have never hidden anything from him, so Chen Qingdu was not only a friend of his master but also a companion from his past.

Back in the day, the three most senior, strongest, and deadliest sword cultivators among the condemned prisoners had ventured into the wild, taking advantage of the unstable foundation of the Great Way in the wilderness. The shifting sun, moon, and stars, along with the changing seasons, had yet to be established as theorems. Nonetheless, at that time, his master was ultimately acknowledged as the master of the wilderness's Great Way. Chen Qingdu, along with the other leader of the condemned, Guan Zhao and Long Jun, had to risk everything, including their sword arts, to reach Mount Tuo Yue, effectively questioning the sword arts of the entire wilderness.

That battle, both in process and outcome, was never recorded in the annals of history; only a few knew the inside story. The child had heard one of Mount Tuo Yue's direct disciples recount that within tens of thousands of miles, there was indeed a cataclysmic event. It was said that Mount Tuo Yue was halved in height due to the owner of a ragged robe who, in the end, handed over his sword. It was also rumored that the earliest form of the river that now flowed downwards was cut open by a sword strike from him, leading to the grandeur that followed.

But he himself was the most unfortunate. His soul was incomplete, scattered in all directions. The guardians of Mount Tuo Yue throughout the ages had a secret mission—to help him gather his soul fragments. Until now, he had only managed to reunite one soul and one spirit, patching together the remaining fragments from here and there. As for his physical body, it had long since been obliterated, making reconstruction utterly impossible. In fact, he was less fortunate than Long Jun, who at least still had a genuine head left behind. Unfortunately, it had been played with for years by a desiccated demon he named Bai Ying, who, upon taking an interest, could simply pour a cup of wine and invoke some obscure sorcery to create a puppet with combat power comparable to that of a Great Sword Immortal. Too bad he couldn't learn such tricks; otherwise, if he could breach the Great Wall of Sword Energy, the fun would surely multiply.

Yet for some reason, Long Jun, who had lost a soul and two spirits, retained most of his intelligence. As the first Sword Immortal of humanity who once fought alongside Chen Qingdu, he not only never revealed his true form but also refused to reclaim his own head, allowing Bai Ying to trample it at will, all while harboring an inexplicable and intense hatred for his long-lost friend, Chen Qingdu.

The child yawned, waiting quietly for the other side to strike. The outcome was already determined; it was utterly pointless.

After glancing at Chen Qingdu, he turned to observe the young woman standing at the edge of the castle parapet.

Ning Yao.

She was a renowned young sword cultivator throughout the wilderness, and her current level of cultivation was negligible compared to her potential future achievements, which would determine her status in the eyes of many great demons.

What was a genius?

A genius was someone who, regardless of days or years, seemed destined for greatness, with no surprises or setbacks along the way.

He was one such example; that hybrid with the Mo family mechanisms named Bei Qi could be considered half a genius too. His name was peculiar—"Backpack."

His master was the truly remarkable one.

Even his own master remarked, "It's a pity his temperament isn't domineering enough, which has prevented his swordsmanship from reaching its peak; otherwise, he would be the most suitable candidate to suppress the Great Wall of Sword Energy."

There was also a young man in the Central Lands of the Vastly Enlightened World named Cao Ci, who was also one of his kind.

The child had stepped onto the head of a demon of ascendant realm, and he nominally counted as a direct disciple of Mount Tuo Yue. However, it seemed that the damage to his physical body in the prison on the other side of the Great Wall of Sword Energy had cost him too much, diminishing his cultivation to the point where Chen Qingdu could easily pull off his head without resistance. Yet, the unstable physical body of an ascendant realm demon still retained a strength that even he, in his present state, could not withstand. After all, Chen Qingdu was truly formidable. This time, accompanying his master out of the mountain to visit the Great Wall of Sword Energy, he had seen so many who were on the brink of death, with all those Sword Immortals standing on the castle parapet—this trip was worth it.

This twelve-year-old child, who still appeared juvenile, contemplated many things. On the battlefield, only a few blinks of an eye could pass. He clapped his mouth and said, “I plan to deliberately spare you half your life. Would Ning Yao come down to take your place and finish this fight? If she does, you would be quite lucky. In the future, both realms—even four realms—would remember you, and you could become my first opponent after coming out of seclusion, and still live.”

The elderly sword master, who carried a long staff, chuckled and asked the nearby dragon-robed woman, “Is this child acting on a whim, or did he receive the old ancestor’s suggestion?”

The woman shook her head. “In the old ancestor's eyes, there is only Chen Qingdu and the entire Great Wall of Sword Energy. He has no interest in these trifles.”

As the master of the Yao River and thirty-six rivers stretching thousands of miles, she had not fallen into a deep slumber. Or rather, the originally crimson serpent, which involved a Great Way battle, did not allow her to focus on her cultivation. The two sides had fought fiercely for three thousand years, with countless disciples falling, yet neither side's cultivation had been harmed in the slightest; instead, it had steadily improved. The dead soldiers beneath them were merely a feast for their replenishing resources. Compared to sneaking off to kill a great demon every few years and ruining their reputation, it was far more cost-effective to arrange a battle every eight hundred to a thousand years. They called it an arranged battle, but it was merely a mutual isolation of realms to reveal their true forms, creating a commotion. More often than not, they would engage in mutual destruction of half-immortal weapons and a pile of broken artifacts. In the end, when they had had enough, they would shatter the little realm, deliberately making their true forms appear bloodied and mangled as an explanation. After all, both sides understood that their fighting strength was not vastly different. If they were to fight to the death, many of the contemporaries on the Ancient Well Throne would not mind teaming up to consume them, especially that skeletal frame, which preferred to act covertly and dig three feet into the ground, causing many ancient demons who had been secretly nursing their wounds to disappear quietly, actually being refined into puppets. Therefore, the outward fighting strength of the great demon Bai Ying was not high, but his foundation was deep and unfathomable.

The sword master lightly tapped his staff and said, “Now this is getting interesting. I like this child. When we reach the Vastly Enlightened World, I must give him a gift.”

The dragon-robed woman, half a partner to the sword master, teased, “The old ancestor's closed-door disciple, and you think you can offer gifts?”

The old man chuckled, “Whether he accepts it or not is up to him; whether I give it is my business. If he doesn’t accept it, I’ll strike him with my staff, and he’ll be reborn. The Vastly Enlightened World is famous for its earthly treasures; piecing together bones and spirits is no difficulty. Perhaps next time he appears, his aptitude will be even better than it is now, and the old ancestor will thank me for my help. After all, a master killing his disciple can hurt their feelings.”

The child, originally named Guan Zhao, suddenly grinned. It would indeed be better if he faced Ning Yao in his first battle after stepping out.

As expected, his hint was well-received.

Tied at his waist was a beautiful sword-raising gourd, and he glanced once more at Ning Yao on the castle parapet, feeling that her participation in the battle would yield greater rewards. So, this great demon tapped the sword-raising gourd, and a streak of sword light shot out, heading straight for that troublesome young man. Only if Ning Yao fell beneath the castle would he have more opportunities to peel off the little girl’s face, which he coveted as one of the great beauties he sought after, akin to Lady Qing Shan and the Martial Goddess Pei Bei.

As the streak of sword light left the gourd, it surged forward, thick as a well's opening, its sword energy so powerful that it shattered the surrounding unstable sword energy and intent in the air. The speed of the sword light was such that when it was about to strike the young man in the green robe, it tore a deep chasm several meters wide into the earth.

Did they care about battlefield rules? Did they care about the identity of a peak great demon?

In the wilderness, such considerations were non-existent.

Back in the Thirteen Battles, the wilderness had lost; who among the great demons of the Rejuvenation, including the likes of Long Guang, actually took it to heart?

Only the Sword Immortals and the Vastly Enlightened World did.

After the breach of contract, the two great demons who had sworn oaths for the wilderness died on the spot.

Was the wilderness at a loss?

What did it matter if a few more great demons died in exchange for the lives of Sword Immortals from the Great Wall of Sword Energy? The wilderness could afford to lose; what had always troubled the wilderness was the flexibility of the top Sword Immortals, who could move freely thanks to that impregnable Great Wall of Sword Energy. Any Sword Immortal capable of sustaining wounds without dying, and returning to fight again, was the most troublesome!

The issue of falling realms was regarded by both the wilderness and the Vastly Enlightened World as the greatest calamity on the path of cultivation, but the falls of the Sword Cultivators from the Great Wall of Sword Energy were rarely called falls.

After the great demon unleashed a sword from the sword-raising gourd, he began to wait for the outcome, which would only differ in degree of victory or defeat.

As long as the young man died, the old ancestor's disciple could continue fighting. Wasn't there still a Ning Yao? The people from the Great Wall of Sword Energy were all about face, and they were the type to care about their reputation.

If they angered Chen Qingdu and he chose to strike at him, the old ancestor would not hold back. Why not just throw everything into chaos? Both sides would save effort and energy, and the war could finally begin!

On the other side of the parapet, Chen Qingdu could hardly be said to be pleased or displeased. Before that great demon struck the sword-raising gourd, he already smiled and said, “As the eldest senior brother, is it difficult to create a clean battleground for the junior brother? If the opponent goes too far, just leave the parapet, and I will personally help you hold the line.”

Zuo You nodded.

Thus, before the streak of sword light before the figure in green, countless strands of soaring sword energy erupted from the earth, directly shattering the oncoming overwhelming sword light.

“Is this really how we’re starting? Aren't you my opponent?”

The great demon, who commanded countless jade palaces and celestial abodes, landed without retracting the treasures he had painstakingly collected. They were both large and small, swirling around him and gradually moving like stars orbiting a celestial being. The great demon slowly raised a hand, and a white jade ancient hall, the size of a palm, shot toward the battlefield above the two, suddenly enlarging to block out the sun as it crashed down upon the old ancestor's disciple and the young man in green, indiscriminately.

Zuo You drew his sword from its sheath. His sword intent was far from overwhelming; it was nearly still. He merely swung his sword casually.

That enormous white jade hall was cleaved in two by his strike. Not only that, sword energy exploded everywhere, the hall reduced to dust, the great stones shattered, and jade splintered like a heavy rain.

The immortal-like great demon showed no sign of mourning, clapping his hands and laughing heartily, “Good swordsmanship, just the right weight.”

The great demon turned to look at the burly man with a sword strapped to his back. “What do you think? This one can stand by Chen Qingdu’s side; should I leave him to you?”

The burly man replied indifferently, “On the battlefield, let Zuo You take you down first, and then I’ll help you take revenge. If you want to thank me, just shut up; otherwise, it will be the Sword Immortals from the Great Wall of Sword Energy thanking me instead.”

The great demon sighed, “Even if I kill Zuo You, it would still be a losing deal. After all, those grand pavilions of the Chen family in the Bosa continent are all good, but they are ultimately new artifacts. These treasured relics I have kept for many years are all my favorites, each a unique item of the world. Once gone, they are gone; where will I find replacements? You Sword Cultivators are indeed more straightforward; when it comes to slaughter, you never worry about such gains and losses.”

On the castle parapet, Pang Yuanji expressed some anger, saying sternly, “These great demons are deliberately helping that little beast create an atmosphere, trying to disrupt Chen Ping’an’s state of mind!”

Chen Sanqiu's expression grew solemn. 

This was the battlefield of the Great Wall of Sword Energy. Those who fought with reckless abandon for the sake of pride often met with disastrous ends. The demon race of the wilderness loved to provoke impulsive Sword Cultivators.

When the battle began, even if one was a top-tier Sword Immortal, if they thought they could single-handedly tip the scales of fate, they would find it very difficult to achieve satisfaction. They would only serve the demons on a platter, even handing over a series of military achievements.

Many great demons would deliberately set traps, capturing wounded Sword Cultivators in their grasp, torturing them slowly, tearing off their arms and legs, and devouring them, or slowly skinning them alive. The scenes were too horrific for words. The misfortunate Sword Cultivators would find it unbearable; those whose souls had been suppressed would not even have the luxury of choosing self-destruction. The great demons aimed to lure more Sword Cultivators away from the Great Wall of Sword Energy and into the heart of the wilderness for slaughter. If a Sword Immortal intervened, a great demon would immediately surround them, sharing the spoils of war later. History had taught many bloody lessons along these lines.

Once a young Sword Cultivator of noble descent was captured, their family elders or guiding Sword Cultivators would come to their rescue, and even if the young one perished, the Sword Immortal would come again, and then perish again. The same went for the friends of the Sword Immortal; they too would die.

In the end, the young Sword Cultivator would be among the last to die. There had been instances where the young Sword Cultivator had not even been killed by the great demons in the end. Instead, they were merely tossed aside by a great demon during their retreat, ordered to let all demons bypass him, leaving that once-promising youth to the Great Wall of Sword Energy. Many young cultivators, even with their flying swords shattered and their life essence exhausted, often met the same fate: either they mustered a bit of strength to self-destruct on the battlefield or were carried away to self-destruct later at the castle.

The wilderness only cared about victory and life or death; they never minded the process.

Ning Yao said, “They will regret it.”

Zuo You lightly gripped his unsheathed sword, pointing the tip at the great demon who had summoned the white jade hall.

Before the gray-clad elder and fourteen peak great demons, enormous whirlpools suddenly appeared, each with sword tips breaking through the void, slowly emerging.

It was as if between the wilderness and the Great Wall of Sword Energy, a total of fifteen small realms had been added.

In the Vastly Enlightened World, the Sword Cultivators Zuo You were simultaneously questioning all great demons.

Both the wilderness and the Great Wall of Sword Energy, regardless of cultivation level, understood one thing: on this battlefield, the more attention one drew, the greater the chance of death in the next battle. Those who could avoid death were seeking it; those who could take their time dying would die faster.

First was Chen Ping’an.

Then came Zuo You.

The literary sage lineage of the Vastly Enlightened World never played by the rules.

That golden-armored, burly man suddenly revealed his enormous true form, his golden armor expanding while firmly suppressing the great demon. The armored man extended a hand to meet the sword tip, pushing back both the sword and the whirlpool, eventually shattering the long sword and the whirlpool together. His golden armor was splashed by sword energy, and the man did not even glance back; he merely looked down to see a flaw appear in his golden palm. Unfortunately, it was quickly covered and filled by the dense golden light gathered by his fingers. The burly man was greatly annoyed and returned to human form. But upon reflection, he decided that the young man, who had decent swordsmanship, must be dealt with by himself in the next battle.

On the line of sword immortals who could sit upon the Ancient Well Throne, various great demons displayed their abilities, some striking to shatter both the flying swords and whirlpools.

Some of the movements were great, shaking the earth, such as the Sword Immortal standing by the skeletal great demon Bai Ying, who met sword with sword, large and small sword tips clashing, scattering countless sparks, resembling a gorgeous rain of fire falling upon the earth.

Some great demons displayed esoteric techniques, similarly raising their hands to create a small realm that collided with theirs.

The burly man did not act personally; he simply allowed his disciple to rise into the air, wielding his sword in defense.

The scholarly man in the Confucian robe handled things most easily. He let the enormous flying sword soar out of the whirlpool, rushing toward him, then the flying sword shrank in the air, rapidly changing size until it became a petite flying sword, hovering before the Confucian-robed man. He brought his fingers together, smiled slightly, and casually turned it, sending the sword tip darting toward a distant place in the Great Wall of Sword Energy, vanishing in an instant.

The Confucian sage sitting at one end of the castle parapet also flicked his fingers, guiding the flying sword into the swirling white mist created by the river of time in the wilderness, and the next moment, it inexplicably fell straight down from above the head of the Confucian-robed man, who smiled and lifted his sleeve, causing the sword to dissipate, returning the fierce flying sword infused with the river of time's aura back to the earth.

Throughout this battlefield, the child paid no mind to the streak of sword light approaching from behind or to the subsequent destruction of the soaring white jade hall by a sword strike from the parapet.

Only the departure of the sword light from the sword-raising gourd and the explosion of the white jade hall led to the surrounding sword energy shifting chaotically on the battlefield, causing the child's vision to become slightly blurred.

He tugged at the corners of his mouth, gently kicking the great demon’s head beneath him away, ensuring it wouldn’t be a nuisance. After all, a deceased disciple of Mount Tuo Yue could hardly be considered a senior brother.

He withdrew his foot and simply stood there, neither dodging nor evading.

Finally, his opponent was willing to strike; what a gentle and amiable person he was.

Being so cautious was rather meaningless. Leaving the parapet to confront him directly, it would be hard to survive; death would come much more easily.

However, when he thought of how to deal with the corpse and soul to entice Ning Yao on the parapet to descend and fight him again, even to die together, the child felt somewhat troubled.

He could not bring himself to chew on limbs or gnaw at human faces; he was not some great demon, nor did he possess a true form towering hundreds of feet tall. Even if he opened his mouth to the fullest, how long would it take to disgust someone? He worried that before he could make someone nauseous, he’d be half-sick from the ordeal himself. Moreover, he was merely a sword cultivator with an unstable soul; just practicing swordsmanship was exhausting. He had not even learned the celestial method that used the soul as a wick to ignite.

Now the child, who had taken the name “Li Zhen,” only felt that fighting was just fighting. However, upon arriving on the battlefield, he found that thinking too much was quite regrettable. He realized he had not been earnest enough in practicing swordsmanship before, and he was now distracted by the hidden jealousy and hatred of certain senior brothers and sisters.

Li Zhen surveyed his surroundings absently.

His opponent was manageable, a sword cultivator with two flying swords.

One flying sword was extraordinarily delicate and sharp, like a needle and thread, filled with an ancient charm, reminiscent of many lesser, yet swift-killing swords of the Sword Immortals.

The other flying sword had a momentum interwoven with lightning, openly revealing its power, resembling those Sword Immortals renowned for their lethality.

No wonder he could draw the attention of the Great Sword Immortal; he had some skill.

Yet there was something odd; he had summoned two flying swords in one breath but did not use them to attack. Instead, he still approached quickly.

The child was somewhat troubled. He had accumulated too many external items; ever since leaving Mount Tuo Yue with his master, he had been busy receiving gifts. First, it was his senior brothers and sisters who insisted on giving him things, and later, many great demons he couldn’t even recall the names of eagerly presented him with treasures. Did they think he was some sort of hoarder? It was honestly a distraction from his cultivation. He had never expected that today, it would finally come in handy; otherwise, with his rising cultivation, he would have to deal with heaps of junk every few years. Giving them away was unpleasant, and throwing them away felt wasteful. So his master was right; one should not be too lax in cultivation. It was better to reach the upper Five Realms before slacking off. At least learning the ability to store treasures in his sleeves would significantly ease his burden; he wouldn’t fear mountains of treasures piling up.

Once Li Zhen hesitated, he decided to stop hesitating altogether. He would take a hit; if the opponent had the skill to produce another flying sword, so be it. If they had some celestial treasures, then let them smash down on his head.

However, allowing the opponent to strike first would not hinder him from preparing his next move. He wasn’t just boasting about wanting his opponent to die quickly.

Therefore, Li Zhen stood still, and within ten zhang, the ground rose by an inch, forming a moderately-sized earthen platform. In an instant, from all directions—not just the battlefield where the two stood, but extending to near the castle parapet of the Great Wall of Sword Energy and soaring thousands of zhang into the sky—there appeared a kind of pure sword intent originating from the Great Way, not mere sword energy. Without any warning, it condensed into substance, crisscrossing within this elevated platform, like threads entwined, glistening white under the sunlight. The sword intent intertwined to form what appeared to be an imprisoning cage of sword intent around the child.

The figure in green did not choose to engage in close combat. In the moment before the cage formed, he seemed to sense the strange shift in the world and altered his trajectory. However, he did not come to a complete stop; he merely slowed down slightly, drifting like a wisp of green smoke, a lonely soul wandering ten zhang away from Li Zhen, keeping well clear of the ominous sword-intent cage. He pinched a stack of talismans in each hand, countless in number, tossing them out at random, letting the talismans drift with the wind or embedding them around the earth. Occasionally, some yellow talismans would approach the elevated earthen platform, only to be silently shredded into pieces by the stationary sword light formed from sword intent, ultimately scattered over the platform.

Li Zhen felt a bit disappointed. “You don’t even dare to exchange your life with me? You really are a lackluster sword cultivator. It’s rare for me to give you a generous chance to die gloriously, and you don’t seize it. I’m not a relative, and we don’t have the custom of burning paper for the deceased on this side; what are you doing?”

Li Zhen strolled slowly, and the cage followed suit, the sword intent that had originally scattered in the world gradually gathering more and more, the cage expanding larger and larger. For some reason, outside the Great Wall of Sword Energy, all the ancient sword intents that were of different origins chose to remain eerily still at this moment, neither following the sword intent to merge nor opposing it too harshly.

The two elder Sword Immortals, Chen Xi and Qi Tingji, who had both inscribed their names on the Great Wall of Sword Energy, communicated via their minds, “This must be the remnant sword intent left by the early senior Guan Zhao, which for ten thousand years has never favored any descendant of the Great Wall of Sword Energy. No wonder.”

Qi Tingji frowned and sneered, “A senior? Such a scum who would abandon the sword path to reach the pinnacle of swordsmanship? Can he be considered a senior to us?”

Chen Xi did not wish to dwell on this matter, lamenting, “It’s fortunate that Chen Ping’an fled quickly; otherwise, being entangled within would cost even a Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator their physical form to have a chance at survival. But if that’s the case, how can we continue fighting?”

Qi Tingji gazed into the distance, “To reach the peak of Chen Ping’an’s fist intent, he must undergo a process of gathering and releasing. That child isn’t idle either; he’s one who creates and seizes opportunities. Otherwise, if he were to attempt such a move from the outset, it wouldn’t be this effortless; most of the remaining sword intents would attempt to intercept him. Fortunately for Chen Ping’an, this kind of opportunity to sharpen his fist techniques through the Great Way is rare. This formation is ultimately just a borrowed sword array, not something that can hold for long.”

Chen Xi shook his head. “Don’t forget what identity he currently holds; he won’t lack for good items to rely on.”

Li Zhen strolled casually on the battlefield, chuckling, “One move has passed. You can’t just keep wandering around like this; don’t think that because you’re far from me, you can casually set up your talismans. Do you know how annoying that is? Do you really think I’m only here to take hits?”

The child snapped his fingers; coincidentally, he had also finished setting up his formation. Even upper Five Realm Sword Cultivators would find it quite difficult. So now, you may go die.

In the space between heaven and earth, along the route Li Zhen had taken, a long string of faint golden characters appeared, varying slightly in height, more or less, intermittently linked together. In the end, they formed a line, the faint golden characters resembling the talismanic truths written on golden talisman paper; the content reflected Li Zhen’s earlier trivial words, some spoken aloud, yet through that fleeting moment, it was evident that Li Zhen had many unvoiced thoughts that had materialized. Notably, among them were the Five Thunders Talisman, the bronze pagoda, the rusted broken sword, and many other treasures that had fallen.

On the ground, a massive golden lightning bolt formed a crooked, enormous circle, encompassing the battlefield within a hundred li.

Higher than the Great Wall of Sword Energy, the cloud sea gathered, and thunder roared in response to the earthly thunder pool.

Simultaneously, the Five Thunders Talisman began to slowly ascend, radiating brilliance.

A towering pagoda of glorious light stood erect.

The broken sword shattered with a bang, and all fragments aligned along the edges of the thunder pool.

The eighteen Sword Immortals in the painting slowly emerged. Even though they were suppressed by heaven and sword intent, their forms were only the size of mustard seeds. Nevertheless, each “Sword Immortal True Intent” they formed still exuded sword energy, hovering close to the ground with a natural trajectory of sword energy in motion. Ultimately, the eighteen mustard-seed Sword Immortals were responsible for guarding each of the treasures.

Because the many treasures that seemed to be carelessly tossed out by Li Zhen, upon landing, displayed various phenomena.

Why so talkative? It was simply that there were far too many treasures.

His cultivation level was temporarily insufficient, so he could only rely on these treasures, half-immortal weapons, and celestial weapons to make up for it.

Li Zhen no longer yawned or spoke; his expression was calm as he watched the young man opposing him.

One hand held an invisible grip, in his palm was a sword pellet, spinning slowly without any aura of treasure flowing. Yet it was a celestial weapon.

The other hand was similarly clenched into a fist, but instead of a sword pellet of celestial weapon rank, it contained a talisman of the ancestral lineage of the Five Sacred Mountains.

Since the days of the Great Wall of Sword Energy and even earlier, Sword Immortals had always preferred to struggle against heaven.

So, you should bear the brunt of the heavenly tribulation first.

After the heavenly tribulation comes the earthly tribulation.

After the earthly tribulation, Li Zhen still had a meeting gift as a sword cultivator of the wilderness to exchange swords with the Sword Cultivators of the Great Wall of Sword Energy.

Thus behind Li Zhen appeared several figures of black-clad immortals, towering several zhang tall, their forms ethereal and elusive, only their long swords visible, the sword intent condensing, the sword light dazzling.

Among them, one Sword Immortal stood distinctly taller than the others, his features clear, expression indifferent, and his form the most stable—he was the ancient human Sword Immortal, Guan Zhao.

Li Zhen frowned.

He saw the figure in the green robe, one hand held behind his back, the other clenched in front of him, his gaze fiery. Dressed in deep green robes, he no longer rolled up his sleeves. Surrounded by the gathering winds of heavenly tribulation, his sleeves billowed, seeming to contain refreshing breezes. They appeared incredibly wide, like a lotus flower blooming in an overly dark green hue, almost black as ink. He smiled and asked, “Is this all you have?” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 723: Li Zhen is Dead**

Li Zhen relaxed his furrowed brow, a minor setback that did not impede the overall momentum. 

He was the first to step out of the Thunder Pool, a formation anchored by eighteen treasures from the mountain. The sword intent crystallized in his gaze as he led the other black-clad immortals out in sequence.

Turning his head, Li Zhen remarked, “What a clever trick to deceive the mind, using the Yin God’s astral journey. I’ll consider this Thunder Pool as a parting gift, a consequence of your two calamities.” 

The cost was not small—eighteen treasures, eighteen focal points of the formation. After enduring the heavenly and earthly tribulations, a majority of the treasures would be rendered nearly useless, with two semi-immortal weapons, the Five Thunder Seal, and the imitation White Jade Capital Tower surviving only to “fall in rank,” downgraded to the status of mere magic items.

However, he was Li Zhen, the disciple of an elder who was currently in seclusion, so he could bear this loss without issue. 

Yet one small mishap followed another; first, this person had replaced Ning Yao on the city wall, then had never engaged in close combat, which had wasted the deadly sword intent trap. Now, he had even managed to deceive Li Zhen himself, leaving only an astral traveling Yin God to bear the brunt of the Thunder Pool’s catastrophe, enough to severely injure a Jade Purity Realm sword cultivator, which ultimately displeased Li Zhen.

At only twelve years old, he was brash and arrogant, trampling on the head of a great demon, standing still as if inviting him to attack. 

This person hadn’t even taken the bait. 

Any young sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall would typically know no limits, and aside from Ning Yao, they would have been doomed without question.

Li Zhen couldn’t help but turn back to look again. 

The man in the green robe, after Li Zhen had revealed the mystery, no longer concealed himself. His feet lifted from the ground, his sleeves fluttering as he distanced himself from the earthly calamity. With a flick of his wrist, he produced a folded jade bamboo fan, lightly tapping it against his palm. His garments rippled, and his green robe transformed into a snowy white robe. Meeting Li Zhen’s gaze, he smiled and said, “You’ve gone to such great lengths to trap me, a mere Yin God. Does it not pain you to let me go? Won’t you stay in the Thunder Pool and keep a close watch over me, lest the calamity fail to strike me down, rendering your efforts in vain?”

With one hand holding the fan, he raised the other, palm open to reveal remnants of a blue talisman, as if some blue mud had smeared his hand. 

Just a single talisman had exchanged for so many semi-immortal weapons and the loss of their rank for Li Zhen. 

The key was allowing the true body to escape from a place of certain death.

On the city wall, the sword immortals mostly breathed a sigh of relief. 

Dying heroically still meant death in the end. 

Li Zhen laughed and said, “A Yin God is still just a Yin God; it’s ultimately not an illusion. Gone is gone. Your cultivation level seems to be quite low. Moreover, below thirty, how can you surpass Ning Yao and Pang Yuanji? Even with a treasured artifact by your side, if the worst comes to pass, and you employ some bizarre divine ability to resist the calamity for a moment, wouldn’t that still lead to your demise? Perhaps you would even inadvertently grant me a stroke of fortune. If others give it to me, I might not be keen to accept, but snatching it from you, even if it’s a piece of junk, I would find it meaningful.”

As Li Zhen gradually distanced himself from the Thunder Pool, he continued speaking, “Though I don’t know who you are or when the Sword Qi Great Wall produced someone as interesting as you, I do know that Ning Yao from the Sword Qi Great Wall can hear me. If you voluntarily return the favor to Chen Qingdu, and Ning Yao doesn’t stop you, then Chen Qingdu will dare to bet heavily; from that moment on, I knew you had to die. What does it matter if you pay a price? Killing you might be just as good as killing Ning Yao.”

Li Zhen pointed to the high Sword Qi Great Wall, “A price? In the future, the entire city wall will be my cultivation ground.” 

He looked towards the young man in white robes and waved, “Farewell.” 

The Yin God shattered, from then on a soul incomplete; for cultivators, this was akin to leaving behind a chronic illness that no divine being could cure, their combat power severely diminished.

The Yin God smiled lightly, his sleeves shaking, talismans flowing like clouds and water, covering the sky. The previously discarded talismans were crushed and shattered by Li Zhen’s treasures, but that was fine—he had plenty of talismans.

Five Elements Talismans, Thunder Method Talismans, Snow Mud Talismans, the Yang Energy Lantern Talismans from "True Records of Alchemy," the Handover Talismans taught by Qi Jinglong, the Mountain Search Talismans taught by student Cui Dongshan, no less than twenty types.

The earlier talismans were unable to form a formation, which was a pity, but they could still utilize the remaining flow of spiritual energy from many talismans to help observe the subtle movements of the heavenly and earthly calamities.

Li Zhen suddenly stopped and asked, “Was that earlier display of suicidal intent merely a ploy to lure me into using this formation early?”

The white-clad Yin God smiled, “Guess.”

Li Zhen kindly reminded, “Enjoy the difficulty of those heavenly and earthly calamities, and remember, the eighteen guardians of the treasures, the Dust Sword Immortal puppets, once the calamities are activated, they will be idle. Each strike will be equivalent to the full force of an Earth Immortal sword cultivator.”

Li Zhen turned his gaze somewhere else, “Is it time for you to reveal your true form?”

Earlier, Li Zhen had played a little trick on the head of the Yue family sword immortal, and the strange talisman that had hidden the other’s aura was no longer effective—hiding anywhere would be useless now.

Wherever Li Zhen’s gaze fell, ripples spread like water, revealing a young man in a green robe with rolled-up sleeves, two flying swords resembling the swords from Bei Ju Lu Prefecture’s Hateful Sword Mountain spinning around him, Pine Needle and Thunder Cough. 

The two flying swords flashed past in an instant.

Li Zhen ceased to speak, and behind him, two black-clad immortals formed from sword intent rushed forward, their sword light like a rainbow.

Chen Ping’an stomped down, disappearing into thin air, dodging the two sword lights, while two other black-clad sword immortals appeared. One stood before Li Zhen with a sword, while the other vanished without a trace.

Only that towering “reflection,” which was most substantial and nearly real, remained steadfast behind Li Zhen.

A sword cultivator of lower realm yet a martial artist of considerable prowess? 

What kind of person was this?

Li Zhen’s displeasure lessened somewhat.

The great demon, Chongguang, bowed and stood behind the gray-clad elder, hesitating to speak.

The gray-clad elder smiled, “In this wild world, closing the doors means we are all family. Li Zhen may suffer a small loss and hardship, but it’s still very early to discuss victory or defeat.”

Only after enduring hardship can one truly understand the importance of practicing swordsmanship. No longer should he harbor deep-seated rejections of the “reflection” identity.

Chongguang smiled obsequiously, but felt a chill run down his spine.

Wasn’t the outcome a certainty for Li Zhen?

The gray-clad elder remarked, “He won’t lose, that’s for sure.” 

Chongguang broke out in a cold sweat.

The gray-clad elder smiled, “Being this close for so long, you’ve gained quite a bit of the aura of the Dao, consider it a reward for the previous two skirmishes.” 

Chongguang bent his back and retreated quietly.

On the city wall, no sword had yet been drawn to cleave through the sea of calamity clouds.

Among the young sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall under thirty, without exception, they were the geniuses among geniuses; this was a rare year for the Sword Qi Great Wall in thousands of years.

The last time such a remarkable year occurred was during the most brutal battles of the Sword Qi Great Wall, leaving only Chen Qingdu guarding the city wall.

However, this time, the Sword Qi Great Wall had taken excellent care of these children over the past thirty or forty years. Of course, the price was that many Earth Immortal sword masters had died protecting these kids. 

Pang Yuanji said, “If it were me, with the heavens falling and the earth unleashing its killing intent, I wouldn’t be able to avoid it; I could only harden my resistance and die.” 

Gao Youqing, sister of the Marquis of Gao, whispered, “I’d just die even faster, dying in that sword formation.” 

Dong Huafu said, “That little brat is a disciple of the Lord of the Moon Mountain in seclusion; aside from Sister Ning, it’s normal for anyone to lose. Just look at us, who can produce so many semi-immortal weapons and treasures at once? So according to Chen Ping’an, when dealing with someone rich and powerful, we shouldn’t just ‘huff and puff to take on a head,’ but should make them ‘fight our group.’ By then, we can split the spoils and everyone will be rich.” 

Pang Yuanji replied, “The reasoning is sound, but we must also recognize that this little brat can command so many treasures all at once, which is not something just anyone can accomplish. This time, battling Chen Ping’an, it was fortunate that Chen Ping’an managed to avoid those traps, but next time we face such a person, we must be particularly cautious.”

One young sword cultivator, whose relations with Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, and the Distant Mountain Tavern were not particularly good, spoke up, “Compared to that hand blacker than a heart, that little brat just picked the wrong person.” 

Ning Yao looked up at the sea of calamity clouds, remaining silent. 

If it were her, blocking wouldn’t be difficult, but the repercussions would be far-reaching and troublesome. 

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Ning girl, if it were you taking the stage, there wouldn’t be any such bet. And since I’ve brought Chen Ping’an to the city wall, there’s no such ‘if’ anymore.” 

Chen Qingdu recalled a rare memory, “Wu Chengpei once questioned A Liang, asking who in the world cannot die, and whether surnames and families had anything to do with it.” 

“A Liang couldn’t answer; it’s the most troublesome question to respond to, so he later had to visit Moon Mountain and the River of Drifting Leaves.” 

Chen Qingdu smiled and turned to Ning Yao, “I naturally value you and Chen Ping’an, but I truly don’t think you are beyond death. Let’s be honest, it’s a bit complicated, Ning girl. Do you understand what I mean?” 

Ning Yao nodded, “I understand. But I’m very unhappy, not for myself, but for Chen Ping’an.” 

Chongguang scoffed, “There are plenty of us who are unhappy.” 

Chen Qingdu, however, smiled more, finding it easy to converse with Ning girl; being straightforward was also good, “That’s fine. It saves one from being overly concerned; it’s good to be unhappy. Otherwise, it’s just a cautionary tale. Why practice swordsmanship? Why practice swordsmanship? Life and death become a loop. Only today do I feel somewhat like a true sword cultivator.” 

Chen Qingdu spoke as if ignoring the rest, muttering to himself, “A true sword cultivator.” 

A true sword cultivator fights for the world but forgets life and death, transcending life and death. 

This matter, which is profoundly difficult to achieve, can also occur in the most unintentional moments. 

It’s a peculiar situation where many middle-stage sword cultivators can do it, yet upper-stage sword immortals find it increasingly difficult. 

As the world becomes less beautiful, hearts grow weary and reluctant. As the world improves, one inevitably becomes reluctant; if one’s swordsmanship is not high, reluctance is helpless. It’s better to die for oneself or others, but if one’s swordsmanship is high, one can find countless reasons to avoid death, which is only natural; it cannot be demanded. 

The heart of man is indeed one of the most interesting cages set up by the gods back then. 

As for the other cage, it is the perception of the passage of time; ancient sages divided heaven and earth, and later generations received an invisible protection, merely observing from the shore, hence always feeling a bit lacking. Therefore, any person, before truly proving their path, even in the Ascension realm, is inevitably bound to feel a sense of life's vanity. This is a great dilemma that sages from the three teachings and hundreds of schools have been tirelessly attempting to solve for millennia. 

The quest for truth by immortal realm cultivators, the Confucian way of establishing righteousness to stabilize the heart, the Buddhist doctrine of breaking attachment, and the Daoist path of returning to simplicity are all focused on this matter. 

Everyone struggles to seek life while silently desiring death; how contradictory! Thus, one needs to pursue a life between heaven and earth, like the sun at noon, with a heart like the moon in the sky, seeing everything clearly and brightly.

Chen Qingdu said something strange to Ning Yao, “No matter the outcome, don’t think that Chen Ping’an will suffer too much in this battle.” 

Ning Yao remained silent. 

Chen Qingdu laughed, “I didn’t ask Chen Ping’an to leave the city wall to return the favor.” 

On the battlefield, dust flew. 

Three ethereal black-clad immortals drew their swords, each standing at a distance, surrounding Chen Ping’an. The sword light shone brilliantly, the momentum like thunder, without any discernible pattern; they were just smashing towards Chen Ping’an. 

One of the black-clad immortals was struck by a fist and scattered, but soon the sword intent reconstituted; a lifeless entity formed from sword intent simply dimmed slightly, and the sword strikes continued as usual, fast and heavy. 

Another immortal struck by their own sword light continued as if resurrected. 

In another area of the battlefield where the power disparity was stark, the clouds infused with the Five Thunder Dharma loomed low, the earth rising in response to the Thunder Pool, clearly aiming to merge heaven and earth, crushing the white-clad Yin God trapped within. 

The third black-clad immortal, who had been hidden in the shadows, made his presence known, unknowingly standing in four directions. 

In the blink of an eye, the earth trembled behind the four black-clad immortals, and divine statues rose from the ground, standing as the most lifelike painted deities in the world. Then, when the four sword immortals simultaneously formed sword gestures, the four heavenly king avatars opened their eyes, displaying fierce expressions. 

One of the statues was resplendent, golden light flowing all over, wearing a crown of five Buddhas and golden armor adorned with jewels, holding a precious banner in the right hand. 

Another statue was golden-skinned, clad in crimson-purple armor, displaying a look of fury, holding a spear in one hand, the spear tip grounded, and a treasured mirror in the other hand reflecting the earth. 

Another heavenly king avatar donned celestial garments, with the left arm hanging down and holding a sword, while cupping a treasure in his palm. 

The last statue was entwined with dragons, in the right hand holding a red rope said to subdue all dragon kings. 

Li Zhen focused on both the opponent’s true body in the formation and the white-clad Yin God amidst the calamities. 

The four heavenly king avatars held treasures, radiating light to form a small world. After the four black-clad sword immortals completed the formation, they vanished into wispy strands of essence sword intent. 

Chen Ping’an delivered a punch, reminiscent of the clouds steaming over a vast swamp, striking the small world’s heavenly curtain, which trembled violently, unable to descend and suppress the earth for the time being. 

At the same time, the flying sword Qi Yi shot out from his life aperture, killing those encroaching sword intents.

Li Zhen tugged at the corner of his mouth; the opponent did have plenty of hidden abilities, and only at this moment was he forced to unveil his defenses. 

Li Zhen’s thoughts stirred, and the “reflection” behind him took a step forward, like a dharma protector, shielding Li Zhen. 

A streak of swift, emerald sword light with unimaginable speed pierced through the body of the reflection, nearly reaching Li Zhen’s brow within a foot’s distance.

Li Zhen stepped back, and the reflection’s ethereal form solidified, reaching out with two fingers to trap the insidious flying sword. 

Unexpectedly, that foiled emerald flying sword retreated. 

Ordinary mortals, with weak physiques, even if they obtained a treasure from the mountain, couldn’t control it and would only suffer. 

Similarly, not all Earth Immortals could fully command a semi-immortal weapon. 

As for binding that immortal weapon to oneself, it was even harder than climbing to the heavens. 

But Li Zhen now possessed two semi-immortal weapons. 

He raised one palm, which was the ancestor talisman of the current Five Mountains True Form Chart, known as the Three Mountains Talisman. 

Once offered, the cost was so high that even Li Zhen would cry out in pain. He was willing to use it against Ning Yao, but was reluctant to do so against this young man. 

Thus, Li Zhen continued to hold his fist loosely, opening the other hand, revealing a slowly rotating sword pill in his palm, which had once belonged to him—or rather, to that reflection. During the battle at Moon Mountain, it had already been shattered, but Moon Mountain had spent a great price nurturing it for millennia, allowing it to gradually recover to its peak. Historically, during every siege, ancient demons would be tasked with extracting the sword intent from the Sword Qi Great Wall and secretly delivering it to Moon Mountain. Among them, the direct descendant from Moon Mountain personally took risks to steal more sword intent, which was why Dong San and Chen Xi had trapped him.

Capturing an Ascended demon was far from the same as killing one. 

When Li Zhen opened his palm, the sword pill emitted a slight quiver, causing the world around him to begin to distort, and that sword immortal reflection, which was merely a crystallization of sword intent, turned its gaze towards him. It was clearly a lifeless entity, yet now it showed a hint of a complex, human-like expression. 

Li Zhen raised his head, re-clenching his fist, smiling at the “reflection,” “This is mine, not yours.” 

The reflection lightly swung its sword, knocking the suddenly appearing emerald sword light away. 

Li Zhen no longer cared about the elusive flying sword, striding forward through the void form of the reflection, continuing to observe the battle. 

That young man was truly not ordinary; when the heavenly king avatar’s spear struck down, he actually blocked it with his arm, and his entire body was driven down, legs sinking into the ground. 

On the city wall, the young geniuses of the Sword Qi Great Wall continued to exchange words. 

Dong Bu could not help but smile, “Another one-sided encounter where Chen Ping’an has no power to fight back; it’s completely one-sided.” 

Guo Zhujiu nodded vigorously, “That little brat is truly impressive; he and Qi Shou can be considered brothers. When they meet on the battlefield in the future, they can share their heartfelt sentiments before the fight.” 

Chen Sanqiu couldn’t help but chuckle. 

In truth, these seemingly light-hearted banter were due to the tension in everyone’s hearts. 

Just as that fearless little girl from the Green End, at this moment, was drenched in sweat and deeply worried. 

During the process where the clouds descended and the earth rose, before heaven and earth fully merged, the entire Thunder Pool was connected to the sea of clouds; five thunders struck the ground, and between heaven and earth, more and more long whips of lightning appeared. Before hitting the ground, they would split into numerous thin, chaotic electric snakes containing the true essence of the Thunder Method, the white-clad Yin God was trapped within, forced to constantly evade the wind, needing to avoid not only the thunder pillars smashing down but also those chaotic electric lights spreading like branches and leaves.

However, when heaven and earth merged, and the two calamities overlapped, there would be no place left to hide. 

Li Zhen smiled at the four avatars, “No need to rush; allow this originally lofty pure martial artist to slowly become a skeleton, tasting the flavor of a commoner becoming a god.” 

After saying this, Li Zhen looked up at Ning Yao, having heard from his Moon Mountain senior sister that sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall were most susceptible to this tactic. 

The Yin God and the true body were respectively trapped in two battlefields, likely among the few exceptions. 

But Ning Yao didn’t even glance at Li Zhen, merely staring at the sea of clouds, which was falling faster and faster. 

Ning Yao was unconcerned by Li Zhen’s provocation. 

Far from the city wall, flying swords continued to dart towards Li Zhen, as if the sword cultivators were questioning the sword. 

This time, it was not just the emerald sword light, but three swords arriving simultaneously. 

The first was Pine Needle, a delicate and slender sword. 

The reflection struck out a sword, but that flying sword suddenly changed its trajectory, disappearing without a trace, leaving only a consistent trench on the ground. 

With a twist of the wrist, the reflection continued to attack, this time with the imposing Thunder Cough, still retreating without a fight; it was merely affected by the overwhelming sword energy, causing the sword tip to skew as it retreated. 

Li Zhen found it somewhat amusing. 

So it was just two swords putting on a show? In an ordinary battlefield, it could indeed frighten people, capable of altering life and death. 

But truly lethal flying swords, like the fifteenth, came from the side, piercing through the air, drawing an arc as they swiftly attacked the back of Li Zhen’s head. 

Now the reflection was being dragged down by Li Zhen’s current realm and thoughts, unable to fully act on instinct to strike; it wasn’t at the peak of its true body, and the sword immortal reflection drew its sword too late, simply reaching out to grab that flying sword. 

Li Zhen didn’t care about this assassination at all. 

Taking a hit from a sword wouldn’t matter. 

Moreover, there was still the reflection to obstruct the flying sword. 

Li Zhen’s only concern now was to ascertain whether the young man’s true body was genuinely complete or merely a Yin God projection. 

Once the true body remained hidden somewhere unknown, poised to act, it would once again be an unexpected turn of events that would cause Li Zhen embarrassment. 

After all, this opponent seemed too different from the straightforward sword cultivators. 

It was supposed to be like the left and right on the city wall. 

Li Zhen thought for a moment, waiting for the dust to settle in both battlefields would be good, but idling around didn’t seem right. 

He summoned forth a flying sword hailed as his prized possession, shooting up into the sky, leaving behind a streak of pure white light, eventually transforming into a bright moon over the wild world, shining alongside the sun. 

The full moon hung in the air, its light pouring down like water, illuminating the battlefield for hundreds of miles. The ancient sword immortal sword intent, once illuminated by the moonlight, mostly appeared to slow down slightly. 

The Thunder Pool was a small world, reliant on the accumulation of treasures and his somewhat superficial knowledge of talismans. 

With the four black-clad immortals standing as a distraction, it was not merely an illusion; once the avatars stood tall, it became another small world. 

Once Li Zhen summoned his life sword, it became the third one. 

Li Zhen focused his gaze; the moonlight falling on the earth bore the aura of the flow of time. Thus, as Li Zhen’s thoughts solidified, the third small world outside the two cages froze, still encompassing over a hundred zhang beneath the earth. 

It turned out that the young man had no more means left, making it impossible for him to hide his true body somewhere else. 

Those three flying swords, real and fake, finally showed some awareness, no longer entangling with Li Zhen, and instead flew off in the distance like headless flies, especially those two imitation flying swords swayed precariously, extremely comical. 

In the small world, aside from those sword immortal sword intents seemingly unbound by the heavenly Dao, the rest of the countless sword energies were reduced to powder in the flow of moonlight. 

Li Zhen let out a sigh of relief; there were no more unexpected occurrences, but he also felt a bit disappointed. 

The reflection’s flying sword had already escaped, and its sharpness was quite remarkable. 

However, the reflection remained safe; that emerald sword light, over time, failed every time, eventually unable to escape the fate of the master’s death, causing the original flying sword to shatter alongside him. 

Both it and its poor master were merely struggling in their dying breaths. 

In the first realm of the Thunder Pool, heaven and earth had already merged, and amidst the high altitude above the city wall, sword energies surged forth like waves, as if all the sword immortals were simultaneously launching their swords. 

The small Yin God, 

In the second realm of the small world with the four heavenly king avatars, the pure martial artist, who was now a bloody mess, had both hands and shoulders exposed as bare bones. Li Zhen's claim to turn him into a skeleton was clearly not mere delusion. 

Inside the second small world, Chen Ping’an, drenched in blood, continued to punch, attacking one point of the small world barrier like a divine being drumming on a stage. 

His fists were made of bones. 

With each punch, the flying sword Qi Yi complemented with a strike. 

The sword in the third small world, the fifteenth, suddenly pivoted its tip as if to meet Qi Yi head-on. 

The two swords clashed, and a slight gap appeared in the barrier of heaven and earth. 

The young man in blue, with one final punch akin to a divine being drumming, sacrificed his broken arm, opening the heavens in an incredibly brilliant display, launching directly towards the most exalted existence of the wild world, Li Zhen. 

Yet, from breaking through one small world to dive into the next, he should have been hindered by his injuries, moving slower than before; that would be reasonable. 

However, the peak punch intent flowed like a waterfall, as if a divine being had descended upon him, enabling Chen Ping’an to move with the speed of thunder, instantly covering over ten miles, the golden punch intent colliding with the moonlight flowing from Li Zhen’s life sword, directly exploding the latter. 

Ning Yao on the city wall gazed with sparkling eyes, seeing the still blue-robed Chen Ping’an, who had lost his white jade hairpin, struggling to refrain from looking at the calamity of the Thunder Pool.

Li Zhen no longer held his fist loosely; with a gentle grip, his entire arm began to separate into flesh and blood, bones shattering. 

He hadn’t anticipated needing to resort to such a desperate measure with the semi-immortal weapon talisman. 

Li Zhen’s entire arm had vanished, his complexion somewhat pale, but where he had once clenched his fist, an ancient talisman with a distant aura appeared, suspended in the air. 

The young man, whose arm hung limply, shook his left sleeve, revealing a golden robe, continuing to rush forward, but at the same time, the robe automatically donned itself.

In the next moment, a mountain range with three peaks appeared on the ground. 

The young man, who had changed from a blue robe to a golden robe, was nowhere to be seen. 

A golden thread swept past high above the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Crossing over the three great mountains, it cleaved the small world created by the moonlight and the flow of time, directly descending upon Li Zhen’s head. 

Li Zhen tossed the sword pill in his hand, which instantly merged into the center of the reflection. 

The sword immortal reflection’s ethereal form immediately erupted with sword light, soaring to a height of several dozen zhang, wielding a long sword to block that golden long sword. 

Li Zhen bled from all seven orifices, his heart filled with rage. 

How unfortunate—he had to drag himself down with this! 

Only Ning Yao should have been worthy of making him pay such a huge price! 

To control that semi-immortal weapon talisman, Li Zhen had to sacrifice a soul and a spirit! And that sword pill, after merging with the reflection’s sword heart, was initially meant to be sacrificed to trade lives with Ning Yao! 

Otherwise, as long as his sword heart conflicted with the “reflection,” it would mean he could never truly command a puppet reflection holding a semi-immortal weapon, which would be utterly useless, further damaging his path heart in this lifetime. What was the point of fighting alongside Chen Qingdu, and dying without learning from the Dragon Monarch’s reflection? The oldest prisoner of the Sword Qi Great Wall deserved to die cleanly and thoroughly.

Li Zhen suddenly turned his gaze towards the high altitude where heaven and earth collided, his eyes widening in shock. 

It was a slowly descending white jade hairpin. 

There was truly no sign of the white-clad Yin God anymore. 

Above, the sword immortal with a trajectory of unwavering golden light clashed with the long sword held by the reflection. 

Except for where Li Zhen stood, the earth around him instantly sank several dozen zhang. 

Between the white jade hairpin and Li Zhen, two flying swords that had been merely putting on a show, Pine Needle and Thunder Cough, fortuitously suspended in a straight line. 

As the white jade hairpin descended, a figure appeared—Chen Ping’an. 

In an instant, Chen Ping’an stepped onto the flying sword Pine Needle, and in the next moment, stood on Thunder Cough. 

Before becoming a Wind Control Realm martial artist, he had a method to escape with a sword. 

Thus, Cui Dongshan, Qi Jinglong, and Nalan Yexing studied and developed this secret technique for Chen Ping’an. 

First, they refined Pine Needle and Thunder Cough into something akin to “talismans,” allowing him to use them as anchor points in the river of time, helping Chen Ping’an instantly withdraw from the battlefield, over a hundred miles, or even several hundred miles. 

However, ultimately, for someone like Chen Ping’an, a pure martial artist, the escape method should still be used to battle to the death! 

Chen Ping’an’s true body had always merged with the Yin God; he merely let the opponent believe that his Yin God had left for an astral journey, escaping the Thunder Pool. 

Intentionally getting wounded by the eighteen Dust Sword Immortal puppets, “injuring” the Yin God, only at the very last moment did his true body and Yin God hide within the Yin God’s head, the jade hairpin. 

Otherwise, had he hidden in there early on, perhaps that temporarily unclaimed white jade hairpin would have fallen into the opponent’s hands. 

As for Qi Yi, Pine Needle, and Thunder Cough, the four flying swords were left for the pure martial artist Chen Ping’an outside the Yin God, along with that semi-immortal ranked robe, Golden Li. 

Both sought only for survival, which was enough. 

In the mere moments where thoughts flowed, speaking of realms and swordsmanship was unnecessary; simply considering the multitude of thoughts, even the sword immortals on the city wall could not match Chen Ping’an. 

It was for this moment to strike. 

Li Zhen looked up, his expression complex, having deployed all his means, wondering what he could do in response; the worst outcome, that unexpected turn of events, seemed to have truly arrived. 

Chen Ping’an reached out to grasp, silently reciting a word. 

A sword cleaved down, directly severing Li Zhen’s body in two. 

Li Zhen merely slightly turned his head. 

Thus, he managed to preserve a complete head. 

The long sword in his hand was merely a semblance of sword intent condensed, while Chen Ping’an, atop the city wall, had not wasted his time. 

It was not the sword immortal still confronting the reflection. 

A scholar observes the world; all things can be taken and turned into one’s own use. 

After Chen Ping’an landed, the sword intent from the long sword shattered, and he stepped onto that head, extending a fist to capture all the souls trying to scatter and escape.

Li Zhen’s already incomplete soul was thus held by an unnamed young sword cultivator, gently lifted, surrounded by the faintly resonating sound of spring thunder. 

Chen Ping’an crushed that head underfoot, fingers like hooks, sinking into the opponent’s soul, asking, “Little waste, why aren’t you chattering anymore?” 

Li Zhen’s soul showed no resistance, pulling at the corner of his mouth, just as he was about to speak, Chen Ping’an shattered him with a punch, “Do I beg you to say another word? Can you do it?” 

Between heaven and earth, only the sword energy and fierce winds brushed against the young man’s temples and robe. 

In the distance, fourteen great demons stirred restlessly. 

The gray-clad elder raised his hand, stopping these peak existences of the wild world from striking at the young man, stepping forward with a smile, “Little fellow, your state of mind is commendable.” 

Not only that, the gray-clad elder waved his sleeve, casually dispersing the reflection that had swallowed the semi-immortal sword pill. 

Moreover, that Three Mountains Talisman Great Mountain also vanished without a trace. 

Chen Ping’an then grasped the flying sword coming towards him, its tip pointing directly at the gray-clad elder, his actions already impossible to provoke further, yet he remarked, “But don’t bully the small; I’m the one with the smallest courage.” 

The gray-clad elder smiled, “Knowing when to accept and retreat, go back to your Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

Chen Ping’an held the sword immortal and turned to leave. 

Along the way, the ground was barren, and he collected everything in ruins, even the head of that Ascended demon was not left behind, all gathered into his possession. 

The white-clad Yin God flew out from the white jade hairpin, the majority of his body now a skeleton, merged with the pure martial artist Chen Ping’an, reuniting as one. 

Chen Ping’an suddenly stood still on the battlefield, raising his hand to clench a fist high, then slowly retracting it, smiling at Ning Yao, gently tapping his chest, resulting in a mouthful of fresh blood, his figure swaying, then was “pulled” by the telepathic sword immortal to ascend to the city wall. 

During this time, a handsome great demon could hardly contain himself, wanting to slap the sword-raising gourd, simply launching a wave of sword energy to eliminate that extremely irritating young man. 

However, upon a smack, the sword-raising gourd remained still. Seeing the gray-clad elder, that great demon begrudgingly withdrew his hand. 

The gray-clad elder stepped forward, standing between the fourteen peak great demons and all the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, extending a palm, “Chen Qingdu, according to our agreement, draw your sword.” 

Chen Qingdu smiled and asked, “Why such a big show? How about two swords instead?” 

The gray-clad elder withdrew his hand, smiling, unwilling to respond. 

Chen Qingdu turned to Chen Ping’an, waving, “We can’t let you work in vain; come here, I’ll personally teach you a sword.” 

Chen Ping’an was held by Chen Qingdu’s hand on his shoulder. 

Not only on this end of the Sword Qi Great Wall, but even the peak great demons in sight also found no trace of the sea of clouds anymore. 

Moreover, on the ground between the great demons and the city wall, not a speck of dust dared to rise. 

On the Sword Qi Great Wall, behind Chen Qingdu and Chen Ping’an, an old man in white robes suddenly appeared, sitting cross-legged on the city wall, extending a large hand to grasp a long sword, simply stabbing downwards without any sword technique, heading straight for the gray-clad elder’s head. 

Once again, a storm of yellow sand arose. 

Moments later, the dust suddenly settled, the gray-clad elder still standing on the battlefield, but his body was now suspended in mid-air, his hands behind his back, keeping his promise, having solidly endured a sword from Chen Qingdu. 

The fourteen peak great demons, the vast majority feeling somewhat unsettled. 

Half of them turned in unison to glance backward. 

The gray-clad elder turned to leave. 

He was the manifestation of the Dao in the wild world; having endured a sword from Chen Qingdu was merely the wild world bearing that sword, insignificant in itself. 

Since ancient times, the wild world had been barren; after this one sword, what could be broken across thousands of miles of mountains and rivers? 

But after ten thousand years, Chen Qingdu indeed became somewhat more skilled in swordsmanship. 

Because there remained a small portion of sword intent that did not follow the gray-clad elder’s command, still forcefully impacting a vast distance behind the great demons. 

Chen Qingdu patted Chen Ping’an on the shoulder, “Have you learned anything?” 

Chen Ping’an wiped his face, all blood flowing from training with the sword, not answering the question posed by the elder sword immortal but instead asked, “Is that boy still alive?” 

Chen Qingdu smiled, “He was never alive in the first place; how could he talk about dying? But if we only speak of that boy pieced together from those souls, not considering the reflection, he could indeed be considered fully dead. Once the boy dies, the reflection dies even more so. To add a gloomy note, the true sword heart of the reflection is vastly different from that of the Dragon Monarch; it has never deviated from the sword path. Thus, the crucial soul of the reflection was hidden away in Moon Mountain, intentionally not presented to that boy; otherwise, if the true sword heart of the reflection were to appear, with that sword pill forged into the sword heart, returning the reflection to the Sword Qi Great Wall would be asking for trouble for those beasts in the wild world.” 

Chen Qingdu remarked with surprise, “You don’t feel any guilt towards that reflection senior? That’s very unlike Chen Ping’an.” 

Chen Ping’an replied nonchalantly, “Even if it were a clueless boy, if the reflection’s true body were to appear before me, daring to speak such words, I would still kill him.” 

Chen Ping’an turned his gaze to the south. 

Once the gray-clad elder left, the fourteen great demons also retreated, and the other great demons dispersed. 

Chen Ping’an closed his eyes, cursing, unexpectedly falling in rank; this fall was several ranks at once. Fortunately, relying on past experiences in Bei Ju Lu Prefecture, he managed to endure the calamity of heaven and earth, finding compensation in the elevation of his martial artist rank. As long as the Longevity Bridge remained unbroken and the four crucial life items were still intact, now he was merely a fifth-stage Qi Practitioner; falling several ranks didn’t seem too fatal. He just needed to quickly nurture a truly meaningful life flying sword using the sword taught by the elder sword immortal, and it would be a matter of fortune and misfortune... 

Ning Yao carried Chen Ping’an on her back. 

In the last moment before Chen Ping’an completely lost consciousness, he vaguely heard the sound of horns echoing. 

The siege had begun. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 724: Moonlight Cleansing the Sword to Slay the Thieves**

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, and in an instant, four flying swords appeared simultaneously. The first one was showing off, the fifteenth was still obedient, while the other two, Pine Needle and Thunder Cough, were merely imitation swords—despite being forged, they lacked the same spirit.

The small room was filled with the familiar scent of medicine.

Looking out the window, dusk was approaching.

Closing his eyes, Chen Ping'an sensed the distant aura of the Sword Qi Great Wall, then opened his eyes again, retracting the flying swords. His mind sank into his personal microcosm, inspecting the aftermath of the great battle, primarily checking the four key acupoints.

In a battle among cultivators, if the Vital Qi Palace (Qi Mansion) was reduced to a wasteland resembling a battlefield ruin, it would mean a fundamental damage to the Great Dao.

However, as soon as his mind's mustard seed manifested, a fierce fire dragon slithered toward him. On its head stood a golden little figure, still dressed in a Confucian robe. Besides the sword at its waist, there was also a small golden scripture, and its head had transformed into a shiny bald dome.

The golden little figure glared at Chen Ping'an from atop the fire dragon, brimming with menace.

Chen Ping'an feigned bravado, saying, "Don't curse, alright? When I get riled up, I can curse at myself too."

Did that little bald head care about such things? It launched into a tirade.

Chen Ping'an couldn't really engage in a verbal duel with the golden figure, so he had to pretend to be deaf and mute. After all, without its help in patrolling the microcosm and controlling the pure martial energy, if he interfered with the operation of the acupoint's spiritual energy after such a massive battle, it would be like adding fuel to the fire. The martial energy of a martial artist and the spiritual energy of a cultivator would already be clashing fiercely in his microcosm, resulting in dire consequences.

On the water side, the spiritual energy was completely depleted, the water patterns on the murals dimmed, and the small pond dried up. However, the inscriptions, the painted murals, and the small pond had not been fundamentally damaged; they had merely suffered wear and tear. The mural had some paint flaking off, and many of the already unstable images of water deities were swaying and dispersing even more, as though a few water deities, which should have been brightly luminous, had lost some of their shine.

The entire water palace appeared somewhat desolate, with the green-clad boys sitting idly, looking up at the mustard seed of Chen Ping'an’s mind. They didn’t complain out loud but wore gloomy expressions, their eyes filled with resentment. Chen Ping'an could only promise them that he would do his best to replenish the household soon and restore vitality to this side. The green-clad boys all drooped their heads, clearly skeptical.

On the other side of the water palace gate, the golden little figure sat cross-legged on the dragon's head, glaring at the green-clad boys.

The lethargic little fellows immediately stood up to respectfully see Chen Ping'an off.

Upon leaving the water palace, the golden little figure began to ride the fire dragon again, chasing after Chen Ping'an and cursing him.

The mountain shrine and wooden house had similar circumstances, requiring a tailor to patch things up. With the help of divine money and corresponding treasures of the five elements, they could slowly fill the gaps.

The damage to the three key acupoints and his vital objects had caused Chen Ping'an to drop three realms, so now he was a major cultivator of the second realm.

The good news was that the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops, revised by Ah Liang, no longer had any barriers.

The first and fifteenth swords occupied two critical Qi Palaces, continuing to hone their sword edge at the Dragon Slashing Platform.

The earliest three strands of "extremely tiny" sword qi lingering at the acupoints had dwindled down to just one last location, like an empty house, waiting to be filled.

All that was left was for Chen Ping'an to cultivate a flying sword that was truly worthy of being his vital sword, becoming a genuine sword cultivator.

The last barrier of the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops could not be crossed for a long time because the acupoint where that sword qi resided had unwittingly become a "border stronghold" obstructing the sword qi cavalry.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an chuckled, finding the golden little figure’s bald head quite adorable.

Unexpectedly, as soon as the thought crossed his mind, it felt as if he had received a divine drumbeat right to his chest, and he coughed out a mouthful of stale air and blood.

What a grudge to hold! Where did he learn that? It should be from his own first disciple, the founder.

Chen Ping'an dressed in his boots and got out of bed without any hindrance.

Outside, the old woman Bai was waiting in the corridor and smiled, "Young master, you’re awake?"

Chen Ping'an opened the door and asked, "Bai, how long have I slept?"

Bai replied, "Not long, just three days and three nights."

Chen Ping'an sighed in relief, "How's the battle at the city wall?"

Bai laughed, "Strangely enough, they put on such a grand show, but when it came to the actual siege, it was still just a small skirmish, similar to the previous two sieges—they were just sending people to their deaths."

Chen Ping'an responded with an "Mm," turned around, and moved a long bench into the corridor, sitting down to chat with Bai.

Bai’s words were meant to ease his mind.

On the surface, this was indeed the case; after all, Bai would never speak carelessly about such major matters. However, the underlying truth, that suffocating feeling of dark clouds pressing down on the city, that the storm was about to arrive—Bai could not be completely unaware.

A few loud thunderous clashes that amounted to little were all just to build momentum.

The appearance of those fourteen great monsters would not simply be to accompany the gray-robed elder in admiring the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Seeing Chen Ping'an's calm demeanor, Bai teased, "Aren't you in a hurry to head to the city wall?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "No rush, there’s no need to hurry. I’ll take a little time to recover, then find a way to make myself less conspicuous before I head to the city wall to help out. Otherwise, if I stay too close to Ning Yao, even if I don’t cause trouble, the results will be far from what I expect. I just need two days to recover most of my combat strength, and then I can go up to the city wall."

Bai nodded, "That's true. Right now, young master is one of the top three deadly figures. If you’re not careful, you might attract the attention of one or two great monsters."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "I’ve suddenly jumped so high in the rankings? The wild world values a second-realm Qi practitioner so much? I get it; it’s clearly a trap aimed at infuriating Pang Yuanji, Qi Shou, and Gao Ye Hou."

After Bai shared a knowing smile, she sighed, "I understand many principles, like when helping you practice, I should be a bit heavier with my strikes to be beneficial, but I still can’t be as ruthless as Nalan Laogou. You’ve been through enough of the martial world; your experience in battles is ample, so there's really no need for me to worry."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "Every chess game is new. No matter how dangerous the martial world is, how fierce the battles on the mountains are, they cannot compare to the siege and defense at the Sword Qi Great Wall. In the Haoran world, the death of a land immortal cultivator is often a major incident. It’s not just Bai who worries; I’m even more afraid. But precisely because I’m afraid, I end up thinking about trivial matters more often."

Chen Ping'an extended his hands, sketching out a chessboard, then circled a small territory within it, softly saying, "If this is a massive chessboard, with the two sides being the wild world and the Sword Qi Great Wall, then that gray-robed elder is one side of the chess. His skills are profound, and he has many pieces. The great sword immortal is our chess player on this side. I have a low realm, so when I dive into the battlefield, what I need to do is hide as much as possible on the grand chessboard, feigning weakness, quietly creating a small chessboard that I can control. Underneath the vast heavens, if I have that small world, I’ll have a great chance of winning and lesser unexpected events. So if I hadn’t been in such a hurry back then, I wouldn’t have wanted to engage in battle too early; I would have liked the wild beasts of the wild world not to know there’s a fellow named Chen Ping'an at the Sword Qi Great Wall from the beginning to the end of the war."

At this point, Chen Ping'an pulled out the sword nurturing gourd, shook it, and smiled, "Good thing I got used to thinking more at that moment before leaving the city."

The bet between the great sword immortal and that gray-robed elder was, in fact, quite profound.

One could even say that it was Chen Qingdu’s wager that led Chen Ping'an to almost instantly determine the final strategy to confront his enemies.

The reasoning was simple: how much weight Chen Ping'an carried was clear to the great sword immortal, perhaps even clearer than that of the eldest disciple.

Chen Qingdu could see the general depth of the young man known as Li Zhen.

So Chen Ping'an understood in an instant that he didn’t need to be ruthless and exchange lives with his opponent.

It wasn’t about survival but about victory.

As for Li Zhen, he had overestimated his own status in the gray-robed elder's eyes.

What the gray-robed elder truly wanted in a disciple was a new "viewing" who had completely changed his path and inherited all the sword intent.

As an existence manifested by the Great Dao of the wild world, the importance he placed on his direct disciples like Li Zhen was, at most, on par with Ning Yao from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Being a piece on a chessboard without realizing you are a discarded piece and not attempting to fundamentally change the situation could be fatal.

It should serve as a warning.

First, there was the death of Huai Qian in the North Julu Continent, followed by the death of Li Zhen under the Sword Qi Great Wall.

One was a prodigy of the Central Land, the other the destined one of the wild world.

Chen Ping'an raised the sword nurturing gourd, “Just a few sips of wine, I won't drink too much. Don’t report me, Bai.”

Bai’s expression softened as she replied, “As long as you don’t get drunk, it’s fine to drink a bit more. Whatever you do, whether big or small, you always manage to put people at ease.”

After a few sips, Chen Ping'an began to cough persistently and quickly put away the gourd.

Such minor actions wouldn’t worry the old woman too much; after all, in this great war, the biggest benefit for him was his martial physique.

That reclusive fellow would likely find that every time he exchanged blows with his young master from now on, he’d have to smash into the wall again.

Bai quietly asked, “With the calamities of heaven and earth being so perilous, why does the young master take such great risks?”

However, after hearing from Nalan Ye Xing later, the old woman still felt a lingering fear.

Chen Ping'an replied softly, “Earlier, when I traveled to North Julu Continent, I wasn’t unfamiliar with the Cloud Sea Tribulation and the Thunder Pool’s creation. In fact, the principles governing both are quite similar, so I handled it without too much panic. That’s to say, luck is still something to talk about. As for that battle, Li Zhen really thought a lot, but luck wasn’t on his side. Speaking of which, if I were Li Zhen, during the battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall, I would have long calculated the elements of 'luck' and 'dominance.' After all, Li Zhen is still too... young. If Li Zhen had experienced the siege and defense battles at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he would be a very formidable opponent when he grew a bit older.”

At this point, Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but chuckle.

Putting forth all his strength in punches and swordplay to kill Li Zhen was indeed a refreshing matter.

The next Li Zhen, pieced together and remade by the spirit of the Moonlit Mountain, would ultimately not be Li Zhen anymore; he would be nothing but the soul's "true self," lacking in both realm and cultivation compared to Huai Qian, who relied on his vital lamp to continue his life.

Li Zhen, ah Li Zhen, indeed, the name wasn’t chosen well.

Chen Ping'an intertwined his fingers, his thumbs tapping against each other, appearing somewhat idle—not that he wasn’t anxious; he was just managing his thoughts.

The person who first taught him this "mind method" was Old Man Yao, but the elder's words were too abstract, lacking in practical wisdom. Since Chen Ping'an was merely a kiln worker apprentice rather than a disciple, the elder was always frugal with his words. Thus, at that time, Chen Ping'an only thought more about the porcelain-making process, but he often became more anxious the more he thought and became distracted the more he focused, due to his frail physique. He always ended up making mistakes with his hands slower than his heart.

The person who truly opened Chen Ping'an's mind, applying a principle to countless matters in life, was actually Ning Yao, during his first journey to the Lizhu Cave Heaven.

In the journey of life, whenever a problem arises, one must first suppress emotions, focusing all thoughts directly on the crux of the issue.

Ning Yao’s words and actions were straightforward and decisive, never dragging their feet, yet she never made one feel that Great Dao was cold and harsh.

So later, while reading during his travels, he came across the phrase, “Winter is lovely, summer is to be feared,” in a history book, which resonated with him deeply.

In contrast, the proud sons of heaven like Ma Kuxuan were like that blazing summer day, with the sun hanging high. It didn’t matter if the world was facing a drought, leading to suffering among the common folk.

Life's encounters quietly determine each person’s closeness to principles.

Some are captivated at first sight, overwhelmed with love upon seeing.

Others feel indifferent, or even repulsed.

No wonder Cui Dongshan joked that if one were willing to delve into the hearts of people and had the ability to perceive the depths of fish in the abyss, there would be no unpredictability in the world. All emotions displayed were simply manifestations of the heart, moving along the paths of life at different paces.

Cui Dongshan had leaked some heavenly secrets, stating that his learning and purpose lay in clarifying the vague concepts of life and death, desires, and emotions, setting out nine relatively general outlines and further subdividing them into thirty-six detailed rules. Beyond these outlines, there were three fundamental rules of calculation that intersected, forming a chessboard.

Every thought and notion of a person ebbs and flows on this chessboard. Why it arises and why it falls are all reasoned.

Such a Cui Dongshan is indeed formidable.

Chen Ping'an even had an intuitive feeling that as long as they secured Baoping Continent in the future, Cui Dongshan’s growth rate would surpass that of National Master Cui Zhan, rising even faster and higher.

Thus, Chen Ping'an needed to be more like a true teacher.

Simply teaching Daoist methods and martial arts to disciples wouldn’t work. Once a disciple with better talent and better opportunities surpassed their master’s skills, the relationship between master and disciple would become complex.

If a teacher only transmits the principles from books but stands in an unsteady position, what can they expect from students who excel in learning, but don’t respect the teacher wholeheartedly?

Bai suddenly laughed, “When you say that Li Zhen will grow to be formidable, he must have thought that before he died, you had already become a terrifying person.”

Karma comes swiftly.

Chen Ping'an forced a smile and said, “I only hope all my opponents think that Chen Ping'an is an easy-going person.”

Bai rose to leave, softly saying, “I won’t delay your recovery. The young lady has instructed that you should focus on recuperating. She and the others can take care of themselves at the city wall.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, then got up and suddenly asked, “The details of my fight with Li Zhen haven’t been leaked, right?”

Bai chuckled, “The sword immortals watching from the city wall didn’t say anything. But here in the city, there are indeed three versions circulating, from Lu Duan, Miss Dong, and Gu Jianlong. Which one do you want to hear?”

Chen Ping'an felt a headache coming on and said, “Only want to hear Gu Jianlong’s version.”

Bai laughed, “That one isn’t very exciting. Lu Duan’s story is the most exaggerated; your story-telling disciple has inherited the true essence. Just from the twenty immortal weapons on Li Zhen, they could boast for quite a while. Miss Dong’s story is the longest, while Gu Jianlong’s version is the shortest, very succinct. It simply states that the second shopkeeper endured that little brat for a long while, and when he couldn’t hold back anymore, he sneakily jumped out and killed Li Zhen with one sword. ‘Good fellow, afterward he made a hefty profit. In plain view, he spent half a day digging around the battlefield. If it weren’t for the fact that he still needed to save face, the way that second shopkeeper was going, he could have pulled out a hoe and turned the earth seven or eight times. Indeed, there’s no shopkeeper in the world who makes a loss.’ Young master, these are Gu Jianlong's original words; I'm just quoting.”

At this point, the old woman was laughing uncontrollably.

In fact, there were even more humorous sayings that she didn’t mention.

“Just our second shopkeeper’s face is incredible. He can just lie flat on the city wall, face down, probably without needing any sword immortal to deal with the enemies. They can just sit on benches, munching seeds, drinking, and watching the show, each minding their own business. After all, the wild world can try their hardest to attack for a hundred or eighty years; they still won’t reach the city wall.”

That Gu Jianlong, who lived on Taixiang Street, had been notorious for his mouth since childhood. He wasn’t a bad person, but due to family connections, he had gotten close to Qi Shou from a young age. However, later on, he also maintained good relations with Pang Yuanji and Gao Ye Hou.

Chen Ping'an stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves, walking beside the old woman with a smile, “This Gu Jianlong, his vital flying sword is called ‘Arsenic.’ I’ve been tolerating him for quite some time. I must invite him to the shop for a drink later.”

The old woman was also curious, “Is there a story?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “That little rascal always says I’m too greedy in my wine business. Isn’t that just throwing dirt on me?”

The old woman suppressed a laugh and agreed, “That doesn’t sound quite right. You’ll have to talk to him about it later.”

Chen Ping'an escorted Bai to the door, then quickly walked toward the room where he kept the ink stamps and folding fans. He grabbed a handful of chess pieces from the chess jar on the table. The first knife, which had been engraved with countless bamboo slips, had already been gifted to his student, Cao Qinglang, leaving him no choice but to use the fifteenth flying sword for engraving.

As he engraved on each chess piece, he wrote down all the details he remembered on paper.

At the battlefield, after slaying Li Zhen with one sword, smashing his skull and scattering his soul, ultimately pointing his sword at the gray-robed elder, it was a matter of impulse, but it was not merely impulsive.

It was also to be able to look at those great monsters more openly from a closer distance, one by one, the strong ones standing atop the wild world’s highest peaks.

Chen Ping'an planned to write a detailed booklet about the great monsters of the wild world.

There were two books on the table; one was the Sword Qi Great Wall’s manual, nearly every sword cultivator had a copy. The other was a copy left behind by Huang Tong, the Law Sword Immortal of the Taihui Sword Sect, given to Li Cai, later transcribed by Qi Jinglong, and then passed to Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes.

The great sword immortal handed over that sword.

In fact, it was to inform those sword immortals who had hidden and hibernated in foreign lands for many years, fellow practitioners like the great sword immortal Yue Huang, that they could draw their swords.

So after that sword, the Sword Qi Great Wall and the battlefield further south began to stir, with unrest spreading everywhere.

The sword immortals hiding their identities in the wild world did not reveal their identities as sword immortals but began to secretly cast their nets, inciting internal chaos under various identities and appearances.

Some sword immortals who had originally thought they had severed ties with the Sword Qi Great Wall changed their minds.

In the depths of the white clouds, a sword immortal crushed his sword sheath, holding a blade without a sheath, descending the mountain.

In a water town of the wild world, a sword immortal rose on his sword.

In a place as prosperous as the imperial capital of the Haoran world, a sword immortal closed his shop, beheading the emperor with one sword, then drinking while riding his sword northward.

A sword immortal, tempered for hundreds of years in volcanic lava, let out a loud laugh, sheathed his sword, and returned to his hometown.

An elderly sword immortal, who had already established a sect in a foreign land, broke through barriers and sought death with his sword. Not for the Sword Qi Great Wall, not for Chen Qingdu, but simply for himself as a human sword cultivator.

For now, Chen Ping'an was unaware of all this; he could only focus on the matters at hand.

Acting as a package shop owner who had just finished a transaction, he took out a white jade plaque as a keepsake.

Earlier, the gray-robed elder had personally instructed him to "take what’s good," and Chen Ping'an did not hold back. Even if the other party hadn’t mentioned it, he would still act as a scavenger.

At that time, the great sword immortal had not stopped him, meaning the items left on the battlefield had not been tampered with, so he could safely collect them.

Li Zhen's formation of eighteen half-immortal weapons and treasures had been mostly destroyed.

Yet even the broken treasures, no matter how fragmented, were still top-notch materials. He wouldn’t miss the chance to gather them, collecting a large pile.

However, there were also some relatively intact treasures.

For example, a Daoist Five Thunder Sealing Seal remained.

Palm-sized, it was extremely heavy.

The material was unclear; it looked neither like jade nor wood. 

Among the seals cherished on human desks, very few depicted characters. Those with portraits carved by literati or scholars were even rarer.

This seal, however, illustrated various ancient deities such as the Thunder General, the Mother of Electricity, the Wind Prince, the Rain Master, the Cloud Officer, the Spirit Official, and the Celestial Man.

The inscription was written in an exaggerated seal script: “Gathering the Five Thunders, commanding all laws. Cutting off the five leaks, the pivot of heaven and earth.”

These sixteen characters were indeed very grandiose, practically swallowing up heaven and earth.

As long as one practiced the authentic Five Thunder method and was a true high-level Daoist who had genuinely comprehended the Great Dao, one could indeed claim, “This body aligns with heaven and earth, and all creations lie in my hands.”

The Huang Ziguo of the Longhu Mountain Tianshi Mansion was among the best.

There was a pair of couplets that enjoyed fame throughout the land, but they were not composed by the Longhu Mountain Daoists but were gifted by outsiders.

“The wind, thunder, clouds, and rain arise in my palm; countless methods open from this.”

Chen Ping'an held this “Daoist heavy weapon that just dropped one realm,” smiling, “This is the ancestor of great numbers and the central five. You now have the opportunity to restore your half-immortal weapon ranking. Previously, you encountered an ungrateful master, but now that you’ve fallen into my hands, it’s fate for both of us. Once I become a divine immortal of the central five realms, mastering the thunder methods, I can take you along to slay demons.”

After giving it a good wipe with his sleeve, he gently placed it on the table. In the future, he could refine it and hang it outside the wooden house, like a copper mirror warding off evil at the entrance of a small town.

He then took out another piece that had also become a treasure of the immortal family, a bronze pagoda that imitated a white jade capital.

Seeing this item brought him the most joy.

After refining it, he would place it in the mountain shrine.

Chen Ping'an didn’t have many thoughts about opening up more key acupoints and placing his vital objects. Now that he had become a second-realm cultivator, overthinking was futile.

Lastly, there was a scroll with an ancient wooden axle that had cracked and a picture of eighteen sword immortals, the top sword cultivators in the history of the wild world.

Unfortunately, the scroll was too damaged to possess any value.

Initially, Chen Ping'an thought he couldn’t be biased, and after refining it, he could give it to that golden little figure. However, he suddenly felt a pang of heartache.

What a great master, looking down on the gift, feeling disdainful.

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to change his mind and place it alongside the bronze pagoda in the mountain shrine.

He put away all the items, returned the keepsakes, and walked out of the house, heading to the small courtyard, then back to the yard.

Ultimately, he was still uneasy about the situation at the city wall.

Thus, he began his six-step stance practice.

However, even after completing a few rounds of the fist stance, even while wearing the ritual robe, he still couldn’t hide the faint smell of blood.

For a cultivator, dropping a realm was certainly not easy.

Chen Ping'an had previously asked Bai whether the details of that fight had leaked, and it had nothing to do with conspiracies.

He simply didn’t want too many people at the Sword Qi Great Wall to be aware of another side of himself.

The rising Thunder Pool and the descending Cloud Sea blurred the boundaries between Chen Ping'an’s true self and his spiritual self. 

At that time, Chen Ping'an found himself in a desperate situation, yet there was a sense of exhilarating joy.

It felt like life should be like this.

Sitting still brought no peace of mind, and walking the stance felt uneasy.

Chen Ping'an could only go back inside, sit down, and carve seals. Even if he earned money, he would ensure every last bit went back to the Sword Qi Great Wall, but the process of earning money itself was a delightful endeavor. This knowledge was not for outsiders.

There were countless sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall, but there were few scholars; whether carving seals or inscribing fan surfaces, those wielding pen and knife had to be steady at heart. If they made a mistake while carving or writing, it didn’t matter.

Chen Ping'an sat at the table, took out the sword nurturing gourd, and occasionally sipped some wine.

Holding the fifteenth flying sword, he carved a snow-white stone seal.

The edge inscription read: “In this world, people busily seek fame and fortune, while I, an old man of the rivers and lakes, look on with disdain.”

The seal inscription: “Let’s go drink.”

He carved another one.

The edge inscription read: “Since ancient times, poets and lyricists have wished to kill that word ‘love.’ I only regret that my resentment for love does not come knocking. Cursing all the wine, anger arises from the depths of the heart, a stick smashing the book, breaking the subtle verses.”

The seal inscription: “Worrying the solitary man.”

He carved one more seal.

The edge inscription: “Without money, the sword immortal has no wine to get drunk; the graceful beauty suddenly gains some weight.”

The seal inscription: “What to do?”

Lastly, he carved one more seal.

The edge inscription: “Underneath the steps, the moss is deep; the young lord waves his fan. By the yellow well, the vegetables grow, tears streaming down.”

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to inscribe the seal, he suddenly squeezed this seal in his hand into a powder.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping'an got up and left the house, heading into the night to fetch the sword immortal from the main room's table.

Drawing the sword from its sheath, the moonlight was like water, shining upon the blade as if it were cleansing the sword.

Chen Ping'an sheathed the sword, not carrying it on his back but hanging it at his waist, then summoned the talisman boat and headed towards the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Heroes slay thieves, sword cultivators kill monsters. How can I not yearn for this? Then let’s get to it! 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 725: Who is Worthy of Ning Yao?

In the early stages of every siege at the Sword Qi Great Wall in history, the scene was always the same, and Bai Lianshuang summed it up in two words: "Sending to death."

On the city walls, sword immortals and sword cultivators all unleashed their flying swords, filling the sky. The sword energy surged like a tidal wave, rushing southward, leaving nothing but dust and ruin in its wake.

The hordes of monsters charging toward the Sword Qi Great Wall fell like grass under the scythe, one after another collapsing to the ground.

In this wild world, three moons hung in the sky, and here at the city walls, the moonlight was at its brightest.

The sword cultivators on the walls were like clouds; the moment their flying swords were released, the deep night lit up as if it were day, overshadowing the moonlight.

Countless monsters, aiming to swarm the Great Wall like ants, were far too early in their attempts. They could only rely on countless lives to exhaust the sword cultivators' spiritual energy (Qi) in exchange for a chance to approach the Great Wall. Every step they advanced northward demanded a heavy price.

A group of great monsters revealed their true forms, led by a powerful ascended monster, tasked with uprooting mountains from the wild lands and carrying them to the southern battlefield, then hurling them toward the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Regarded as one of the top ten sword immortals, Yue Qing, with two swords hanging at his waist—one named "Majestic Guardian of the Five Peaks" and the other a standard sword from the Sword Workshop—did not unsheathe either. Instead, he summoned two of his life swords, with the "Hundred Zhang Spring" cascading down like a massive waterfall, smashing mountains hurled at the city walls into the ground. The earth trembled, crushing countless monsters underfoot, while flying swords danced like larks in the sky, showering the battlefield with sword energy like a torrential rain.

Han Huaizi, the sect master of the Taihui Sword Sect from Northern Julu Prefecture, directed his flying sword not at the monsters charging to their deaths on the battlefield, but in tandem with Yue Qing, to strike down the mountains aimed at the city walls.

Li Tuimi, the chief guardian of the Yan family and a sword cultivator at the Immortal Realm, also wielded two life swords—a white dragon and a black dragon. Once unleashed, the flying swords twisted and turned on the ground like two hundred-zhang-long dragon serpents, slaughtering monsters.

The Immortal Realm cultivator Mi Hu's flying sword, "Ao Yu," left the city wall and tore into the earth, creating ravines on the battlefield to slow the monsters' advance.

His younger brother, Mi Yu, summoned his flying sword "Morning Mist," joining forces with Mi Hu to unleash dense, water-like sword energy, preventing the enemy’s great monsters from filling in the ravines while simultaneously obliterating any monsters caught within.

From Southern Posa Prefecture, sword immortal Yuan Qingshu summoned his flying sword "Frost and Snow," reinforcing the Mi brothers' defenses. The sword energy surged, and many monsters on the edges of the numerous ravines felt as if they were trapped in a freezing blizzard, their flesh melting under the sword energy, leaving only exposed bones.

Wu Chengpei, a sword immortal stuck at the bottleneck of the Jade Purity Realm for many years, sat cross-legged on the city wall. His life sword, "Sweet Dew," was an unusually peculiar flying sword even among those at the Sword Qi Great Wall. It fell into a sea of corpses and blood on the battlefield, yet Wu Chengpei merely held his breath and focused, not attacking the monsters but instead began to refine his sword.

Although the sword immortal Zhou Cheng's realm was not high, she possessed unique luck. As the last surviving member of her lineage, she had forged her life sword, "Seven Colors," from the sword intent of her ancestors over many years of training on the city wall, emanating a rainbow-like glow as if she wielded seven swords at once.

Among the top ten sword immortals, Nalan Shaowei and Lu Zhi did not draw their swords, leading a dozen fast-moving sword cultivators from the Fifth Realm. They patrolled the battlefield, targeting the great monsters hidden within the monstrous army. If any monsters neared the city walls, they would strike them down, ensuring that the monsters could not easily advance to the foot of the wall.

On the city walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the sword cultivators each fulfilled their roles.

The sword cultivators from the Fifth Realm charged forward, leading the tide of sword energy, the farthest from the city wall, engaging the most enemies, thus consuming the most spiritual energy and facing the most peril.

The Earth Immortal sword cultivators from the Nascent Soul and Golden Core realms followed closely behind. They did not require the sword cultivators to kill monsters recklessly; their task was to maintain the formation of the sword energy river flowing from the city. If they had the energy, they sought opportunities to slay the monster cultivators clad in robes and armors, especially the formation masters covertly escorted by the monsters. Upon discovering their presence, they must pay any price to eliminate them on the spot.

The sword cultivators below the Golden Core level had to be even more cautious; their primary mission was not to kill but to form a defense on the city walls to avoid being targeted by the monsters specifically hunting them.

The three groups of sword cultivators took turns on the front lines, putting on an intimidating display, but in the end, it was about real results. The siege of the great monsters was not a matter of days or months; it often lasted for years.

The siege by the wild monsters lasted for three days and nights, merely a prelude.

The only surprise during this time was the appearance of one of the fourteen great monsters, Bai Ying, who sat high on a throne of bones, looking like a supervisor. He stood once to activate the Bone Observation technique. On the blood-soaked battlefield, thousands of monster corpses stood up as if summoned, yet they did not attack nor retreat, merely standing there, allowing the sword energy to shatter them until they lost their last shred of utility.

Bai Ying returned to his throne and raised a hand, seemingly signaling the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall to continue their strikes.

Bai Ying's gaze lingered on Wu Chengpei, showing great interest in his life sword "Sweet Dew."

He looked further out on the battlefield, thinking that if the souls could be washed clean after the massacre, they could bathe in the sweet dew, aiding in the refinement of their souls, which could benefit the Great Dao a little.

Other than that, Bai Ying did not see anything on the battlefield worthy of his attention. Apart from a few of his throne colleagues who remained solitary and did not branch out, including Bai Ying's own Bone Mountain, all other sect forces and their vassals had mobilized. Therefore, if someone could look down upon the vast territories of the wild world like the great monster who refined the moon's spirit, they would see grains of mustard appearing, followed by thin lines gradually moving towards the Sword Qi Great Wall. These were the endless waves of monsters rushing to the battlefield.

Each of these lines represented tens of thousands of monsters, many of them mindless puppets controlled by cultivators. Among them were countless monsters who had taken up the path of cultivation, transforming into human forms, as well as many local heroes who built their own kingdoms like those in the vast world, occupying the most advantageous lands—the fierce monsters from the deep mountains and marshes, along with various gods of mountains and waters, all without exception needed to muster at least half their resources to attack the Sword Qi Great Wall.

If the walls could not be breached, it would mean death.

However, to breach the walls, they must also be prepared to die. The more useless ants they were willing to sacrifice, the more the seemingly insurmountable Sword Qi Great Wall would lose its advantages. The moment it lost all three aspects—timing, location, and human factors—would be the moment when Chen Qingdu would die, utterly losing his soul.

The Sword Qi Great Wall formed its own grand world, and how Chen Qingdu maintained this advantage while the wild world sought to erase it was the crux of the siege, perhaps the only thing that mattered.

What sword immortals wielded their swords for and what ants aimed to swarm the city were all about seizing this.

If the wild world could muster half of its strength, the Sword Qi Great Wall would undoubtedly fall.

Not only would the Sword Qi Great Wall be unable to hold, but the vast world would also suffer consequences across several continents, such as Southern Posa Prefecture, Southwestern Fuyun Prefecture, and Southeastern Tongye Prefecture.

Thus, after the long silence of the gray-clad elder, the first major task he undertook was to divide the wild world into twenty territories. Each of the fourteen great monsters was obliged to mobilize at least half the forces from one of these territories to head to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Those who failed in this small task would not need to live. Once the war began, they would be the first to ascend the city walls to test Chen Qingdu's swordsmanship. Anyone unwilling could go hide at the bottom of an ancient well.

These twenty territories, if the cultivators were relatively weak overall, could rely on numbers instead. However, one thing must be accomplished: all upper-five realm monsters must head north without exception. Anyone who dared to hide or evade battle would be killed on the spot. Yet, for those who had struggled to reach the upper-five realm, they could not be pushed too hard. As long as they were willing to fight, they would not lose half of their future rewards. When they first set out, they should also receive a substantial gift. If these beings died at the Sword Qi Great Wall without seeing the vast world even once, their descendants or direct heirs would be guaranteed a place in the wild world, like kings governing their territories, occupying their own lands, the size of which would be determined by the deceased monster's realm and contributions, all untouchable for a thousand years. If they breached the Sword Qi Great Wall, not only would they receive rewards back home, but any upper-five realm monster could also establish their own sect in this newly rich world.

This agreement initiated by Tuo Yue Mountain, in collaboration with the fourteen great monsters, had already spread throughout the wild world.

In each of the twenty territories, if top-tier cultivator realms were sufficient but lacked robes, armor, or magical artifacts, the gray-clad elder stated directly that the fourteen should lend a hand, not to hide their resources. Whether from their own pockets or borrowing from others, they should give them away. Once they reached the vast world, according to the established strategies, each could scavenge freely, using any means necessary to ensure at least double compensation. If it was insufficient, they could simply come to him and Tuo Yue Mountain for compensation.

This siege would be orderly and divided into eight stages.

Currently, they had only just begun the first stage.

Afterward, the sword immortals at the Sword Qi Great Wall would face constant surprises. For instance, the wild world also had pure martial artists of the tenth realm and sword boats from the Mo family placed atop mountain ferries. There would also be impressive scenes where sword cultivators clashed sword to sword on the city walls. The wild world would gather a large number of martial cultivators, all clad in treasured armor. At that time, a multitude of high mountains would suddenly appear on the battlefield, as the five great mountains of several kingdoms were uprooted, and countless cultivators would rain down magical artifacts from the mountain tops. On their side of the battlefield, all the monsters had to look up at the towering city walls, and as time passed, the battlefield would rise higher and higher.

Ultimately, the Sword Qi Great Wall would truly become a territory of the wild world. With the ebb and flow of fortunes, it would become a defensive position for the monster race.

Bai Ying began to drink, having heard that the vast world had many celestial brews.

The proud sword immortals on the city walls, who loved to strike down monsters, should strike with abandon, reaping battle merits, for they would eventually be overwhelmed by their own accomplishments.

In fact, since the start of the Thirteen Wars, the wild world had already begun its preparations.

The three sieges that ended in abysmal defeats for the wild world were merely training exercises.

The Sword Qi Great Wall seemed to have emerged in response, giving rise to a new generation of young prodigies led by Ning Yao.

In truth, the wild world was no different.

Among them was the young Li Zhen, who possessed the oldest criminal's gaze, clearly one of them. If he died, he would die; the ancestors would not mourn, nor would Bai Ying feel pity.

It should be noted that there were also young sword immortals among the monsters, classified solely by their aptitude for the Great Dao and future achievements, not by their current realms or combat power. The only disciple of that bearded man, who had been ranked third among the hundred sword cultivators.

According to the habit of the Sword Qi Great Wall, once the battle reached a stalemate or disadvantage, the sword immortals would leave the city walls together, dividing the battlefield and appearing on the front lines to staunchly block the monsters' advance.

Then it would be the turn of the Earth Immortal sword cultivators and the young prodigies like Ning Yao to leave the city walls, engaging in a deadly struggle on the battlefield, relying on their skills and fate.

At that point, the weak lower-five realm sword cultivators would appear on the city walls. Once a great monster successfully ascended the walls, even if the tired sword immortals left behind could intercept them, countless poor ants would still suffer.

Endless flying swords shot out from the city walls, trailing numerous streams of light. During this, many sword cultivators retrieved their life swords and returned to the city walls, needing to retreat from the front lines to nourish their flying swords, swallowing pills, breathing, and replenishing their spiritual energy, while simultaneously, the next batch of sword cultivators quickly filled in the gaps, taking turns to fend off the enemies.

This was precisely what made the Sword Qi Great Wall a headache for the wild world.

Sword cultivators could easily hold the city walls, gradually depleting the monstrous army.

The monsters had also deployed powerful great monsters to observe the battlefield. After witnessing this scene, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of melancholy and lament, "Our tribe's siege resembles a colossal beast, bloated and helpless, waiting to be exploited on the battlefield. How tragic and futile."

A black-clad boy, sneaky and furtive, appeared on the Sword Qi Great Wall. After reaching the city walls, he donned a robe from a nearby clothing shop, clipped a sword from the workshop at his waist, and then fled. In the interim, mountains in the wild world were shattered by sword immortals, debris flying everywhere. The Sword Qi Great Wall was extensive; even with swords smashing a significant portion, there were still some that slipped through the cracks and fell toward the city walls with great momentum. The black-clad boy extended his hands, blocking a massive boulder the size of a house for a few young sword cultivators of the middle-five realm who could not evade it. Despite successfully blocking the boulder, the tall, ordinary-looking boy spat blood. Without waiting for the young cultivators to express their gratitude, he wiped the blood and continued running.

Eventually, this boy found a familiar group.

Before this, he had seen many familiar faces, such as the Golden Core bottleneck cultivator Pang Yuanji and the girl Gao Youqing, who, instead of staying beside her brother Duke Gao, had been fighting alongside Pang Yuanji.

He also encountered some unexpected faces, standing beside the sword immortal Ku Xia, wielding their life swords: Lin Junbi, Zhu Mei, and Jin Zhenmeng.

The young prodigy sword cultivators from the Shao Yuan Dynasty in the Central Divine Continent, Yan Lu and Jiang Guancheng, had already withdrawn from the Sword Qi Great Wall, having crossed over to Southern Posa Prefecture via the ferry from Hanging Mountain, supposedly to embark on travels.

The presence of Ku Xia was not surprising to the black-clad boy, but it was astonishing that Lin Junbi and the others stayed behind, not hiding in the city to watch from a distance, but had the audacity to participate in the siege.

Ning Yao, Die Zhang, Chen Sanqiu, Dong Huafu, Yan Zhuo, and Fan Dache were gathered together, each wielding their swords to slay monsters.

Die Zhang bore a massive sword, a sight that amused many on the Sword Qi Great Wall, for one of the life swords of the great sword immortal Yue Qing was known as "Majestic Guardian of the Five Peaks."

This was a coincidence, as it shared the same name as the sword of Wei Jin from Baoping Prefecture and the sword of the half-immortal Qi Shou.

The chubby Yan wielded the sword "Purple Lightning," cursing loudly at the audacity of the monsters to use such underhanded tactics against him.

Dong Heitan, whose sword bore the extremely feminine name "Red Makeup," rested it across his knee. This descendant of the Dong family, who never spent money on purchases, was not cursing the monsters; instead, he berated Yan for his soft strikes, floating around like a drunken Chen Sanqiu.

Dong Huafu typically preferred sweeping attacks. Yan Zhuo claimed that his method of controlling flying swords was unpredictable, not random; it was highly sophisticated, as opponents could not perceive its trajectory, making it even more formidable.

Chen Sanqiu, dressed in white, wore a family heirloom robe of the Chen Clan from Tai Xiang Street. This dashing young man wielded a cloud-patterned sword, having long lost its original sheath, which had belonged to his friend Little Cricket. After Little Cricket’s death, it was collected by Chen Sanqiu, who this time donned a saber sheath from the workshop to conceal the cloud-patterned sword within.

As for the sword originally belonging to Chen Sanqiu, it was now temporarily borrowed by his friend Fan Dache, who had been struggling to break through to the Golden Core level.

Controlling flying swords to slay monsters was no easy task.

Among the monsters were not only physically resilient foes but also various cunning methods specifically designed to counter sword cultivators’ flying swords. There were also many death-soldier monsters inscribed with runes that could lure and bind sword cultivators' flying swords. Once ensnared, they would not hesitate to self-destruct, shattering the flying sword. These monsters did not label themselves as death soldiers and would often feign injury or pretend to make a fatal mistake on the battlefield, revealing one or two weaknesses. Once a flying sword struck their runes, the life sword could meet a disastrous end.

In such circumstances, could sword cultivators still dare to exert all their strength to slay monsters? Would their spirits of sword intent remain unyielding?

This was an extreme test of a sword cultivator's vision and would also forge their resolve.

Ning Yao, with both a sword and a flying sword, glanced at the black-clad boy, feeling slightly helpless but saying nothing. Now that he was here, was she supposed to drive him away from the city walls? Besides, would he even listen to her?

Thus, Ning Yao turned away and continued wielding her flying sword.

Naturally, she possessed more than one life sword. However, over the past twenty years, in the three major battles, the monsters had only witnessed her wielding one flying sword.

The figure of Chen Pingan, who had transformed into a youthful appearance, observed quietly, quickly discerning the situation.

Fan Dache's strikes were overly restrained, not befitting the killing power of a dragon gate bottleneck sword cultivator.

It wasn't that Fan Dache lacked determination or was cowardly; rather, he was in a somewhat awkward position. Killing monsters on the battlefield was not the same as sparring at the Ning Mansion or the Yan family’s martial arts arena.

Fan Dache yearned to catch up with Die Zhang and Chen Sanqiu's sword strikes and hoped to seamlessly coordinate with his friends' life swords. Over time, this desire led to mistakes, requiring Chen Sanqiu and the others to rescue him instead.

In the past, even a lowly Earth Immortal sword cultivator would find it challenging to make out the distant battlefield from the city walls. Now, however, middle-five realm sword cultivators could focus and see every detail.

Chen Pingan understood that this was due to the contributions of the three sages of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, a mysterious divine ability aiding the Sword Qi Great Wall in cultivating a natural advantage.

Chen Pingan approached Fan Dache, who wore a strained expression but could not hide his melancholy. He did not ascend the city wall but merely poked his head out, scanning the southern battlefield. Then he gathered his voice and said with a smile, "It’s not like you’re teaming up to kill that upper-five realm great monster. Just focus on your own sword strikes and ignore Dong Heitan and Yan. As long as they injure a monster, you can maneuver your flying sword to stab it. It’s free battle merits, so why not take it? Those Golden Core sword immortals have the gall to snatch achievements from a lower dragon gate sword cultivator like you? Where's their sense of friendship?"

Die Zhang's flying sword charged forward, its sword intent as pure as the person wielding it.

Dong Huafu habitually chased after Die Zhang with his flying sword, both of them reckless in their own ways. Thus, Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo would coordinate with Die Zhang and Dong Huafu, while also needing to slay monsters. Having fought side by side three times, they had developed a seamless synergy, creating a sense of camaraderie akin to a small world.

Meanwhile, Ning Yao's formless flying sword specifically targeted the more troublesome monsters. While Die Zhang and the others tore through the battlefield, Ning Yao effectively acted as a rear guard, ensuring the other four could strike without worry.

As a result, Fan Dache felt somewhat out of place, believing himself to be the most redundant presence.

Having trained in the Ning Mansion and practiced swordsmanship countless times with these friends in the mustard seed world, Fan Dache was not a naïve sword cultivator untested in battle.

The only reason he felt awkward was that these friends were too exceptional; opportunities on the battlefield were fleeting, and danger and surprise could emerge instantaneously.

Fan Dache couldn’t keep pace with Die Zhang and the others, whether in thought or in the speed of his flying sword.

Upon hearing that familiar voice, Fan Dache did not turn to speak to Chen Pingan, nor did he allow himself to be distracted from his strikes.

This was the habit of sword cultivators accustomed to battle on the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Without hesitation or embarrassment, Fan Dache followed Chen Pingan's suggestion and wielded his sword as instructed. He no longer attempted to align his strikes with Chen Sanqiu and the others but waited for opportunities to slay the monsters that were on the verge of death. Chen Pingan had long stated that collecting heads on the battlefield was akin to collecting money, relying solely on true skill. Who would dare say he was shameless? He would simply use the best bamboo sea cave wine from the Sword Qi Great Wall to spray them.

After observing the battlefield for a moment, Chen Pingan continued to advise, "Fan Dache, to your left, twelve zhang away, there's a wounded monster feigning death. Go, give it a stab."

With a fierce strike, the sword pierced the head of the monster lying on the ground.

Glancing at the battlefield, Chen Pingan added, "You can maneuver your flying sword and temporarily leave Die Zhang and their battlefield. No need to keep pace, just head a little further out and strike every corpse, regardless of whether it’s feigning death. It's safer because they’re less likely to be death soldiers. Don’t be greedy; there are plenty of battle merits. Just treat the southern battlefield as a new training ground. If you wish to keep up with Chen Sanqiu and the others, you need to pay attention and learn from their strike patterns. Sooner or later, you’ll succeed in predicting when they strike, and then you won’t feel like you’re holding them back."

"Withdraw your sword! It’s a death soldier; let Yan go tease it for a bit."

"Did you see that? That monster clearly has some brains; since it can’t gain an advantage from Chen Sanqiu and the others, it seeks to pick on you. In times like these, don’t hesitate—run away! What a pity; its acting skills are lacking. What kind of monster fleeing for its life has such a steadfast gaze and steady hands? When the opponent's hands are steady, their hearts are often cruel, so be extra careful. Your life sword currently lacks resilience; you’re not at the Golden Core level, after all. You’re not like Chen Sanqiu and Yan, those wealthy scions who’ve poured countless resources into their swords. So be cautious with your strikes; don’t seek speed and precision all at once."

"Dache, don’t waste such a good name. Can you at least achieve some enlightenment? That nearly dead Golden Core great monster lying there is waiting for you to strike it down. Its Golden Core was shattered by Die Zhang; I'm telling you not to rush, and I’m not asking you to dawdle when you should be quick! Look, you’ve let Yan take the credit."

"To the northeast, twenty-three zhang away—that monster cultivator over there has just lost a magical artifact. It’s hesitating, but the great monster behind it is intimidating it, so it can’t just turn and run. Dache, what are you dawdling for? Slay it! There, you’ve let Die Zhang snatch it again! Dache, do you secretly have a crush on our boss?"

The upper-five realm monster responsible for observing and monitoring the battlefield seemed to have sensed something amiss in this area.

It was a jade purity realm monster sword cultivator, and a streak of radiant sword light shot straight toward the city walls, targeting the head of Chen Pingan, who was only peeking out.

However, Ning Yao’s long sword emerged from her back and cleaved through the sword light, causing the flying sword to crash down and create a massive crater below the city wall, sending debris flying. The monster sword cultivator who struck without success swiftly maneuvered his flying sword and vanished underground, eventually circling back.

Ning Yao’s long sword returned to its sheath. She remained calm, continuing to control her life sword to hunt the monsters from afar.

Among the group, only Ning Yao’s life sword had not returned to the city walls after three days and nights.

On the battlefield, golden phoenixes soared from the Sword Qi Great Wall toward the southern battlefield, slaughtering monsters.

A great sword immortal’s life sword descended with the size of a ferry.

Zhou Cheng's life sword "Seven Colors" crazily roamed the earth, splattering countless severed limbs.

Ning Lianyun, the head of the Ning family, summoned his life sword, causing a sea of clouds to appear high above the battlefield, with sword energy pouring down like torrential rain onto the ground.

Among the wild world's army, some great monsters also displayed their powers, commanding vast black clouds of crows toward the city walls. Many caught-off-guard sword cultivators’ flying swords went awry, and those that entered the black clouds instantly shattered, ground to dust as if crushed by a millstone, reducing the sword cultivators on the city walls to mere bloodied figures.

Ning Lianyun would not allow that great monster to succeed; using the black cloud of crows to disrupt the sword formation, he subtly commanded one of the cloud seas.

The black clouds of crows collided with the cloud sea of the old sword immortal Ning Lianyun.

A young sword immortal from the Nalan family, who rarely drew his sword, pushed forward, and a crystal-clear white jade platform fell from above, smashing down on the head of the great monster.

The great monster did not resist but retreated. Within a radius of several miles around the great monster, the white jade platform crushed down, covering the ground and spilling blood everywhere.

Not only that, the great monster seemed to be targeted by some peculiar technique of the sword immortals. No matter how it fled or changed its route, the inexhaustible sword energy of the white jade platform fell again and again, affecting countless innocent bystanders.

Eighteen white jade platforms fell in succession, ultimately managing to encase and suppress the great monster, which had no choice but to reveal its true form, bracing itself against the crushing platform. As the constantly cracking white jade platform shattered, the great monster’s body was entirely buried beneath the ground. Yet, only half of its body, bloodied and battered, glared fiercely at the sword immortals on the city wall. It transformed back into a human shape, snorted coldly, and chose to temporarily leave the battlefield to recuperate.

The sword immortal on the city wall left the southern wall and moved northward to meditate and recuperate.

A sword immortal traveled from the north to the south, taking this person's position to guard a territory.

As long as any great monster dared to act, a sword immortal on the city wall would have to respond in kind.

Furthermore, any great monster that had attacked once on the battlefield would be required to face the sword immortals again whenever they reappeared within striking range. 

The great monsters, emboldened and unafraid of death, standing close, would face the combined striking swords of Yue Qing, Ning Lianyun, Han Huaizi, and Li Tuimi—all powerful sword immortals yet not among the top ten. Whether one sword immortal struck or they all attacked together, if they could not heavily injure the great monster, their contributions would be diminished as a group.

This was the rule of the Sword Qi Great Wall, a strict decree set forth by the chief sword immortal.

Moreover, the jade purity realm leaders of the monster army would act without fear of being specifically targeted by the sword immortals on the walls. The Sword Qi Great Wall recognized the loss of any sword cultivator.

Any sword cultivator, apart from exerting their full strength to kill monsters and defend against enemies, must learn to protect themselves during the repeated clashes.

A dead sword immortal was simply dead.

A living sword cultivator, even if they had not yet become an Earth Immortal, held countless possibilities.

Otherwise, where would the skilled sword immortals come from? Would they merely rely on the cautious protection of their predecessors?

Thus, Chen Qingdu’s assertion to Ning Yao that in his heart, no one was irreplaceable was a cruel truth he had never concealed from his juniors through the ages.

The brutal warfare, the perilous clashes, were omnipresent.

And on both ends of the city walls and high above the Sword Qi Great Wall, where the sages of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism resided, there was an even quieter yet more critical hidden battlefield.

The Daoist sage, sitting at the highest point of the celestial canopy, repeatedly waved his white whisk, dispersing the clouds, much like a recluse atop a mountain, engaging in deep discussions through the ages.

The monk sitting on his meditation mat silently recited scriptures, golden lotus flowers blossoming all around, continuously ascending into the air, forming a golden river filled with floating lotus lamps.

The Confucian sage sat upright, opening a sacred book. The golden characters on the page leaped out, and when he finished reading one book, it became blank. He would then open the next sacred book.

Chen Pingan had stepped away from Fan Dache's side on the battlefield. He had appeared near Pang Yuanji, casting his two flying swords, "Cough Thunder" and "Pine Needle," to assist in setting up illusions, quickly withdrawing afterward. He had also shown up to help Gao Youqing and Situ Weiran, offering small assistance. While stationed where the sword immortals gathered, he did not linger. However, he would pause briefly for familiar patrons from his own wine shop, those middle-five realm sword cultivators who had drunk his wine. He would not only cast two imitation swords but also kill monsters with his flying swords, sharp and decisive. Yet, he would never stay too long in one place nor strike in a linear fashion, often returning to battlefields where he had previously fought. He moved out hundreds of miles, rescuing any sword cultivator’s life sword he could and slaying monsters where possible, without seeking to show off or claiming excessive credit.

Moreover, there stood the wooden-faced black-clad boy and the gaunt old man.

As Chen Pingan hesitated, weighing whether to cover his face with the woman’s skin he held, a sword immortal in charge of guarding the formations could no longer bear it and chuckled, "You, a second-realm great cultivator, have some face, don’t you?"

This sword immortal was very close to Yue Qing and Mi Hu, having been one of those who went out to break up fights.

Chen Pingan raised his middle finger at the sword immortal, gritted his teeth, and decisively covered his face with the skin, leaping onto the city wall, his movements surprisingly graceful like a woman's.

Then he assisted a group of young sword cultivators, sneaking and stealthily striking.

The distant sword immortal was initially taken aback, then burst into laughter, feeling quite impressed by this once unimpressive scholar from the Confucian lineage.

After the laughter, the sword immortal observed the young figure whose robe was slightly stained with blood. He collected his thoughts and continued to protect the many sword cultivators leaving the city walls.

Facing south, the sword immortal attentively monitored every detail of the battlefield, while deep within his heart, a thought emerged: only such a young person could be worthy of being a junior disciple, one whom the chief sword immortal would bet on heavily.

Only such a person could be worthy of Ning Yao. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 726: Scorching Summer, Distant Snowy Roads (Part One)**

As the sun rose high over the city, the air was thick with the heat of summer.

Shan Zhuang, Dong Huafu, and Fan Dache had opted to withdraw. Meanwhile, Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, and Yan Zhuo remained steadfastly in place.

Chen Ping'an returned to their side, donning the visage of a middle-aged man. He first assisted Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo in monitoring the battlefield, occasionally offering a few reminders. In contrast to Fan Dache's need for precise communication, Chen Ping'an's words were more succinct, focusing primarily on minor adjustments and optimizations. He provided suggestions regarding the trajectories of flying swords and choices for landing spots; it was a quick review aimed at turning the good into something better. Despite having grown closer over drinks, Chen Ping'an did not underestimate these two Golden Core swordsmen. In fact, his focused observation of their swordplay had yielded him considerable insights.

Afterward, Chen Ping'an sought out Fan Dache.

Seeing the middle-aged face of Chen Ping'an, Fan Dache felt a mix of resignation and gratitude. To be at odds with Chen Ping'an was akin to a streak of bad luck, as if his ancestral grave was not emitting blue smoke, but rather billowing black smoke, pressing down on him.

Amidst his resignation, Fan Dache was sincerely grateful. If not for Chen Ping'an's timely arrival, he would have been floundering for much longer.

Chen Ping'an squatted down and tossed a flask of Bamboo Sea Cave wine to Fan Dache, grinning, “Remember to praise me.”

Dong Huafu chimed in, “Using Fan Dache’s money to buy wine, then later gifting it back to him? I’ve learned something.”

Feigning ignorance, Chen Ping'an affixed a yellow paper talisman to himself to dispel the lingering scent of blood.

Shan Zhuang laughed, asking, “Did you go somewhere else to collect money?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Just wandering around. I was worried about causing more trouble and drawing the attention of certain lurking demons, so I didn’t dare to exert myself too much. I plan to discuss with the Sword Immortals later about taking responsibility for a small segment of the city wall as bait. Whoever withdraws from the battlefield can come find me to witness the swordsmanship of a great cultivator. Just remember to bring some wine; I won’t let you watch for free.”

Dong Huafu shook his head, “Then I won’t go.”

Shan Zhuang added, “I think I’ll pass too.”

Fan Dache, feeling the weight of Chen Ping'an's gaze, gritted his teeth and said honestly, “I don’t dare to go.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Dache, if you don’t go, the wine can still reach you. Who really cares to see you?”

Shan Zhuang and Dong Huafu almost simultaneously stood up, continuing towards the southern city wall.

Fan Dache wanted to follow but was stopped by Chen Ping'an, who gestured for him to wait.

Chen Ping'an said, “Fighting alongside these friends, do you feel a lot of pressure? Like every time you help them, you’re dragging them down instead?”

Fan Dache nodded.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Having such thoughts isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But if you want to do better, you should suppress those thoughts. Remember, Fan Dache, you’re a bottleneck Golden Core swordsman and barely thirty years old. Do you know how remarkable it is for a swordsman who will eventually reach Golden Core status in our Haoran World, even in the North Julu Continent, where swordsmen abound?”

He pointed to himself, “It’s not like Haoran World is filled with people like me. Among your contemporaries of similar age on the mountain, there are certainly those who can kill enemies better than I can. There are quite a few. But there are many more who cannot compare.”

Chen Ping'an slowly continued, “In my hometown, the Eastern Treasure Bottle Continent, in many rivers and lakes I’ve traversed, if you, Fan Dache, were to cultivate there, you would be a prodigy that the whole dynasty would place high hopes upon. You might think I often joke about being a grand fifth-tier cultivator, whether it’s sarcasm or self-deprecation, but it’s not entirely untrue. In my homeland, a demon or ghost from the Cave Dwelling realm is genuinely a formidable demon, a terror-inducing ghost. Just think, a Golden Core swordsman with an innate sword body, who’s only in their thirties, would be held in such high esteem in the Treasure Bottle Continent.”

Fan Dache nodded, “I never thought about these things before. I’ve never been very interested in matters of Haoran World. Since childhood, I’ve felt my talent is just adequate, but not good enough.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, spreading his hands and pointing with two fingers, “What I’m saying is that feeling like you’re making mistakes while standing beside Ning Yao and Chen Sanqiu is an extreme. Feeling like you can wield your sword against enemies in my hometown is another extreme. Both are not advisable.”

Chen Ping'an tucked one hand away and shook the other in a fist, “While those extremes are unavoidable, a swordsman’s heart must remain steadfast here, unwavering. External matters, to put it grandly, are really just external matters, and it’s hard for us to fully control them. But the true heart of a cultivator is always right at your fingertips, and it’s something you can refine and improve at any time. A person’s small universe is insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but the human heart encompasses everything; it can be greater than heaven and earth. Especially for swordsmen, their thoughts and flying swords can transcend, both body and life are free. I believe this is very true. So, this flask of wine, I’ll give it to you as a parting gift.”

Fan Dache’s eyes cleared, and he took a hearty drink from the flask, wiping his mouth before solemnly stating, “Chen Ping'an, if you had said these words to me before, I might have understood them, but I wouldn’t have truly absorbed them. Now, it’s different. I get it.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “It’s actually the same for me. I’ve tasted all sorts of hardships, going through ups and downs, before arriving at today.”

Fan Dache fell silent for a moment before suddenly asking with curiosity, “Which sage or wise person said that line you gave me with the wine? The more I ponder it, the more sense it makes.”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his chin, “Dache, if your little brain isn’t working, that’s one thing, but what’s with that look in your eyes?”

Fan Dache laughed and stood up, vigorously tossing the flask of wine, heading toward Chen Sanqiu and the others.

Unexpectedly, Chen Ping'an reached out and grabbed the empty flask, rising to shout, “Little Golden Core swordsman, in front of a proper second-tier grand cultivator, putting on your grand airs—do you think this wine is free?”

Fan Dache felt a bit guilty and hurried away, unable to resist glancing back to see the second-in-command, tilting his head, finger resting on his temple, then slowly removing a disguise mask.

Fan Dache asked, “Chen Ping'an, if I just can’t forget about her, does that mean I lack ambition?”

Chen Ping'an tucked the mask crafted by Zhu Lian into his sleeve, smiling, “To be infatuated with someone, there’s nothing better than that.”

Fan Dache, puzzled, remarked, “When we first met, you didn’t say it that way. You scolded me quite harshly.”

With a dispirited expression, Chen Ping'an took out his sword nurturing gourd, took a sip of wine, and said with a grin, “I don’t have the energy to explain the intricacies to you; figure it out yourself. Also, you need to display a bit of the aura of a great Golden Core swordsman. When roosters fight, they don’t hold grudges.”

Chen Ping'an had actually stopped worrying about Fan Dache’s emotional wounds. Although Fan Dache seemed to lack brilliance in both cultivation and demeanor, Chen Ping'an was confident that Fan Dache’s path as a cultivator could be long and fruitful. What truly concerned Chen Ping'an was that if Fan Dache heard his reasoning, understood it, and then realized he couldn’t live up to it, it would lead to another kind of trouble.

To know something but not be able to do it is a form of invisible denial. Knowing and acknowledging it is affirmation, but being unable to achieve it is another denial. 

Generally speaking, once one reaches this point, the reasoning reaches a dead end, a grave for the mind, where nothing remains. The most terrifying aspect is that a series of knowledge similar to this will die alongside it, resulting in a significant loss.

Unexpectedly, Fan Dache said, “If I can’t achieve that steadfast sword heart you mentioned, and can’t remain unaffected by Chen Sanqiu and the others, Chen Ping'an, you must remind me often. If once isn’t enough, then twice. I may not have many great qualities, but at least I can listen to advice.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Good to hear.”

Fan Dache added, “Then you should heed my advice, too. There’s a great battle ahead; it doesn’t matter if you take a few more days or half a month. You should first recuperate before returning to the city wall. Otherwise, if this continues, when the time comes for us to leave the city wall for battle, you might find it hard to recover to your peak state. You are my protective formation sword master. Even if you don’t worry about yourself, you should at least consider my little life. Don’t you want to continue enjoying free wine in the future?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “You make a fair point.”

He truly summoned a talisman boat, leaving the city wall.

When Fan Dache reached the southern wall, Ning Yao nodded and smiled at him, “Thanks.”

Fan Dache tried to maintain a serious expression but ultimately couldn’t help but smile.

Dong Huafu commented, “You’re being foolish.”

Among the group, the most graceful and carefree in killing enemies, Chen Sanqiu smiled and said, “Dong Black Charcoal, do you have the ability to make Ning Yao thank you?”

Dong Huafu turned to ask, “Sister Ning, can you say thank you to me?”

Ning Yao continued to gaze ahead and casually threw out a dismissive word.

Dong Huafu nodded, accepting the rejection, and then turned to Chen Sanqiu and Fan Dache, asking, “Sister Ning never shows me any courtesy. Can you?”

Chen Sanqiu gave a big thumbs up.

Fan Dache took a deep breath, summoned his life sword, and with a flash of sword light, flew down from the city wall.

Chen Ping'an piloted his talisman boat, feeling unoccupied, so he imitated his disciples and lay on the bow of the boat, paddling with his hands, as if it really made them go faster?

——

In the interlude of the great battle, several young swordsmen from outside retreated from the southern city wall to the northern one, while another batch of local swordsmen, resting and recuperating, silently took their places. Yet, as they passed each other, the latter bore smiles on their faces.

Yu Juanfu sat atop the northern wall, chewing on the last piece of flatbread. His body brimming with martial intent, yet he was unable to strike, igniting for the first time in his life a profound yearning for the elevation of martial arts. The Seventh Realm Golden Body was ultimately not like the Eighth Realm's Free Travel; once one entered the Free Travel realm, they could soar like the Qi Refining warriors riding the wind and strike freely.

Zhu Mei’s face was pale, drenched in sweat, her heart still trembling. She hadn’t spoken a word since she summoned her life sword. A series of near misses had either been protected by the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal or rescued by Jin Zhenmeng. Even Lin Junbi, still merely a Sea Observation realm swordsman, had helped her once. If it weren’t for Lin Junbi seeing through a demon’s disguise and deliberately luring the opponent into using their trump card, Jin Zhenmeng would have swiftly struck to slay the demon. Zhu Mei would have certainly sustained damage to her life sword, and even if her Dao wasn’t severely injured, she would have had to retreat from the city wall to the Sun Mansion to recuperate; thereafter, she would have had no further involvement in the entire war.

Lin Junbi was discussing previous battles with Jin Zhenmeng.

This was likely the first time Lin Junbi had privately chatted with Jin Zhenmeng, discussing the gains and losses, flaws, and subtleties of their respective sword strikes.

Jin Zhenmeng smiled warmly. Though still not loquacious, she was evidently closer to Lin Junbi.

This was also the first time Jin Zhenmeng felt that Lin Junbi, a seemingly untainted genius, was remarkably human.

Lin Junbi took out an exquisite small porcelain vial crafted by the Shao Yuan Dynasty’s Bureau of Craftsmanship, pouring out three medicinal pills of different hues. He kept the pale yellow one for himself and tossed the dark blue and spring green pills to Jin Zhenmeng and Zhu Mei.

Jin Zhenmeng and Zhu Mei hesitated briefly but ultimately chose to accept them, swallowing the pills.

Lin Junbi began to focus his breathing, cultivating, as the pills gradually dissolved, infusing abundant spiritual energy into several key energy points.

Splitting his attention, Lin Junbi repeatedly pondered the end of the previous heart-seeking game.

With each review, his Dao heart grew a little more complete.

The white-clad young man who had called himself Cui Dongshan, while putting the pieces back into the chess jar, had asked a question: did Lin Junbi dare to stay at the Sword Qi Great Wall to strike down demons?

Lin Junbi had answered affirmatively but added that the risks were too great and the benefits too meager; it didn’t seem worthwhile.

“It’s not a suggestion; it’s an order. Because you’re too foolish, I must say more to prevent my good intentions from turning into your grievances. If what should have been a great boon becomes your reason to complain about me, then when I strike you down, you’ll still feel wronged.”

Cui Dongshan pinched a chess piece, shaking it, “First, it doesn’t matter how many big demons you kill after staying; if you can kill more and gain the recognition of one or two Sword Immortals, that would be even better.”

He casually tossed that chess piece into the jar and picked another, “Second, having Bitter Summer by your side, if you pay attention to your limits, you won’t die. Bitter Summer is dumber than you, but ultimately a rare good person on the mountain. Therefore, the more you act like a good person, the more decisive you are in striking, and the more demons you kill, the more recognition Bitter Summer will have for you every day you’re on the city wall. Bitter Summer already harbors thoughts of self-sacrifice; it may come to a day when he’s willing to exchange his death for yours, merely for himself, turning into a protector for you, Lin Junbi, as the future cornerstone of the Shao Yuan Dynasty. At that point, you need to be careful not to let Bitter Summer truly die for you here. You, Lin Junbi, must continuously dissuade Bitter Summer from that generous notion through Zhu Mei and Jin Zhenmeng, especially Zhu Mei. Even if Bitter Summer insists on returning alone to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he must escort you all the way to the Southern Posa Continent before he can turn back. How to do this and the significance behind it, I won’t teach you; that rusty brain of yours, though young, should figure it out yourself.”

Cui Dongshan tossed in the second chess piece, “Third, once you return to the Central Divine Continent’s culturally prosperous Shao Yuan Dynasty, you should keep your mouth shut. If you can’t shut it, then go into seclusion to avoid visitors. Before you close your mouth, you should certainly have a private talk with your teacher, speaking honestly. Don’t hide anything from him, big or small. Don’t treat your teacher like a fool. The National Master will understand your ambitions and not only won’t be displeased, but will also be gratified because you are kindred spirits. He will naturally help you in secret, doing his part for you, his favored disciple. He won’t personally step in to make a name for you; that’s too lowly a method. I trust the National Master won’t do that and will instead control the narrative, doing the opposite. Yan Lu, who is even more foolish than you, is already your pawn. Once you return home, he will do what he ought to do and say what he ought to say. However, the National Master will stifle any rumors about your experiences at the Sword Qi Great Wall, ensuring that you can wait for the Academy to speak up for you. During this time, the more you keep your mouth shut, the more the Shao Yuan Dynasty will remain silent, and praises will come knocking at your door. You could close your door, and they still won’t be able to stop it.”

“It’s not just the Shao Yuan Dynasty; all surrounding dynasties, vassals, emperors, ministers, and cultivators on the mountain and in the world below will know that there’s a young Lin Junbi who traveled to the Sword Qi Great Wall, bravely facing the battle and striking down demons.”

Cui Dongshan pinched a chess piece, smiling as he asked, “In this ‘Fourth’ point, where is the most subtle detail? Think carefully; don’t let me down.”

Lin Junbi replied, “It’s about letting my teacher feel that my conduct and dealings still seem somewhat immature, allowing him to do things that his students cannot accomplish.”

Cui Dongshan tossed that chess piece, “Not bad; at least you’re not foolish to death. Just wait; as the battles at the Sword Qi Great Wall grow more severe, and the Haoran World is stunned into momentary clarity, your deeds at the Sword Qi Great Wall will become more valuable.”

Cui Dongshan picked up another chess piece, mocking, “Even those Confucian sages from different traditions will look at you, Lin Junbi, with new eyes. The National Master will regard you as a disciple with increasingly great potential, yet the Confucian Academy may no longer see Lin Junbi as merely the disciple of the National Master. This subtlety, you’ll have to experience deeply for yourself; it will be like drinking fine wine.”

Cui Dongshan waggled his finger with the chess pieces, “But don’t get too carried away. All the praises of today will turn into criticisms tomorrow, and often, the same people will do both. This is another subtlety; understand it well, and it will be another bottle of fine wine, intoxicating.”

Cui Dongshan tossed the chess piece in his hand, dropping it into the jar, the pieces clattering crisply. Shaking his sleeves, “Yan Lu is someone who can be utilized. Zhu Mei is someone you must gain the recognition of, especially the latter. Once your relationship with her is handled well, you will enjoy unexpected benefits.”

Lin Junbi quietly inquired, “Is it concerning Zhu Mei’s family?”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “Not just that. What kind of chess are you playing with that gluey brain of yours? Thinking one or two steps ahead to win the game?”

Lin Junbi spoke earnestly, “Please, Teacher Cui, enlighten me.”

Cui Dongshan said, “What Zhu Mei said is not much different from what Yu Juanfu personally witnessed. The two women are inseparable, their relationship close and pure. What wouldn’t they say? If Yu Juanfu recognizes Zhu Mei’s character, and Zhu Mei recognizes you, Lin Junbi, she will naturally say a few genuinely fair words on your behalf. It is precisely because of Zhu Mei’s innocence that Yu Juanfu will listen. Thus, your clumsy scheming at the Sword Qi Great Wall will not become a flaw in the life of Lin Junbi from the Shao Yuan Dynasty. Instead, it will enhance her positive view of you. Do you understand this?”

Lin Junbi murmured, “I’m afraid my understanding is shallow and lacks depth. I wish to hear more about it.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “A person without flaws is the least relatable. Once someone denies you, to then recognize you—such recognition is more steadfast than the initial acceptance. Don’t you understand? You can’t play chess, and you can’t comprehend the human heart; I’m beginning to regret making a long-term deal with you. Why do I feel like I’m going to lose money?”

Lin Junbi hesitated, wanting to speak but then holding back.

Cui Dongshan narrowed his eyes, “Only asking questions without thinking? Do you know my patience is limited? I could easily dispose of you. Do you know why? Because if you answer wrongly, you’ll die.”

Lin Junbi’s forehead broke out in sweat, “I can be foolish on my own, but I can’t let Teacher Cui’s judgment be led astray by choosing a fool as a business partner.”

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Good lad, you’re still teachable.”

Cui Dongshan placed his palm on the pieces in the jar, gently rubbing them, and casually remarked, “An adequately clever yet daring middle-ground swordsman from the Central Continent who doesn’t annoy Yu Juanfu will not be disliked. The Yu family, even that old man Zhou Zhenzhi, will regard a young swordsman who doesn’t displease Yu Juanfu favorably. What do you think? Is it a trivial matter?”

That old man from the Yu family, Zhou Zhenzhi, controlled the rise and fall of two major dynasties; what kind of clever people hasn’t he seen? The old man had lived for thousands of years and was accustomed to the ups and downs of the world. What they’ve seen less of is a young man who is both smart and foolish, full of vitality, not respecting heaven and earth, yet brimming with stubbornness, daring to disregard fame and fortune, even life itself.

Cui Dongshan gently raised his hand, just an inch away from the jar, his wrist turning lightly, smiling, “This is the subtle shift of human hearts, a grand landscape that you just can’t see clearly. A meticulous heart? Cultivators of the divine realm, with such good vision they ignore it, pretending to be blind. Cultivating the Dao? What a farce of a Dao heart. You, Lin Junbi, are destined to display your talents in the halls of power, but if you don’t understand the human heart, how will you discern people, use them, and manage them? How will you gain their unwavering trust?”

Lin Junbi felt a genuine admiration, seriously saying, “Teacher Cui, you are wise. Lin Junbi has learned greatly.”

Cui Dongshan lifted his head, “Wise? You use such a mundane term to describe me?”

Lin Junbi shook his head, “Not only wise but also clear! Only the sun and moon are comparable! This is the realm I wish to pursue throughout my life, not the so-called wisdom of ordinary people.”

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, “That kind of flattery has the style of my mountain’s demeanor. Very good, very good; if there’s an opportunity in the future, I might just take you as a disciple, and then you’ll be able to bow and burn incense at the ancestral hall.”

In truth, Lin Junbi had already harbored a guess, but it was too bizarre to believe.

Cui Dongshan’s laughter faded as he looked down at the chessboard. With a swipe of his hand, all the pieces fell into the jar. He then pinched a lonely black piece and placed it on the board, surrounding it with white pieces to form a large circle.

Cui Dongshan said, “Since I’m treating you as half a disciple to nurture, I’ll have to demonstrate some true skill. Using the strict Yan Lu as an example, you should teach this black piece to feel free, to feel the vastness of life brimming with hope. But in truth, all its thoughts are under your control; you can decide its life or death, its rise or fall, all according to your calculations.”

Lin Junbi found this reasoning straightforward and easy to understand.

Then, Cui Dongshan surrounded the black piece with an even larger circle of white pieces, “This represents the hearts of Zhou Zhenzhi and the Yu family. How will you break this situation?”

Lin Junbi pondered for a long time, wiping the sweat from his forehead, shaking his head, “There’s no solution; in fact, there’s no need to think about breaking it.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Not bad; you’re halfway there.”

Cui Dongshan pinched a white piece and tossed it onto the board beyond the black circle, “On the board, the situation is hard to change in a short time; life isn’t just a game of chess. The difference between first and second moves is only a single piece. But don’t forget that human hearts are free. So, feel free to toss out a thought, observing the larger chessboard from afar, and watch closely; Zhou Zhenzhi is nothing. This is the essence of cultivating the heart.”

Lin Junbi lowered his gaze, staring at the board that was not a chess diagram, lost in thought.

“Yo yo, the deer sings, feeding on wild herbs and apples. I have fine wine, playing the flute and drum, but lack a worthy guest.”

Cui Dongshan shifted his gaze from the earth to the sky, smiling, “A guest on the mountain, a lord among the clouds, sees the birds pass and floats a great white.”

At this moment on the city wall, Lin Junbi too looked up, imitating that “white-clad youth.”

That person was the one who had written the “Colorful Cloud Score,” Cui Zhen.

His chess skills were even higher than the Cui Zhen of yore.

The white-clad youth put away the chess jar and board, standing up to say to Lin Junbi, “Teaching you this is meant to tell you that calculating human hearts is of little significance, there's no future in it.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 727: Scorching Summer, Distant Snowy Paths (Part 2)**

Chen Ping'an did not return directly to the Ning residence; instead, he made a trip to the tavern. 

The tavern was open, but there were no customers inside. The two young workers, Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qu, who had previously helped out at the tavern, had secretly gone to the Upside-Down Mountain, just like the Golden Elixir Sword Cultivator, Cui Wei. Qiu Shu and Pei Qian, along with Cao Qinglang, were off traveling in the Southern Posa Island, while the two boys had followed Cui Dongshan to the Bottle Vase Island. 

Now, three new helpers were at the tavern: a boy named Qiu Long, a girl named Liu E, and the youngest of them, a child named Tao Ban. They were all handpicked from Shiedzhang and were familiar neighborhood faces. 

Unlike his peer Feng Kangle, who had already begun saving money to marry a wife at such a young age—showing a fearless, perceptive nature—Tao Ban was simply fearless, a bit single-minded. As Qiu Long and Liu E chatted casually at their table, they noticed the amiable second shopkeeper and immediately grew tense, standing up as if sitting at the tavern table was slacking off. Chen Ping'an smiled and waved his hand dismissively, “There are no customers; feel free to relax.” 

Only Tao Ban remained slumped on a nearby bench, staring blankly at the empty street outside. 

Chen Ping'an took a seat at the tavern table and asked with a grin, “What’s wrong? Can’t compete with Feng Kangle for a little bride, is that it?” 

Tao Ban sulked, “Second shopkeeper, do you think I really am the kind of person nobody notices as a potential sword cultivator?” 

Chen Ping'an was at a loss for words. 

He tapped the table and said, “Go fetch me a pot of wine, same as usual.” 

Tao Ban reluctantly stood up, calling out, “Liu E, go get a pot of wine from the second shopkeeper, and don’t forget to collect the money.” 

Chen Ping'an pulled out a snowflake coin and handed it over to Liu E, saying that he didn't need any pickles or plain noodles, just the wine. Soon, the girl returned with a pot of wine and a white bowl, setting them gently on the table. 

Chen Ping'an poured himself a bowl of Bamboo Sea Cave wine and took a sip. 

Tao Ban sat up, resting his head on the table, looking rather bored as his fingers tapped on the surface. “Second shopkeeper, I don’t want to sell wine for the rest of my life, you know?” 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Then what do you want to do?” 

“I haven’t figured that out yet,” Tao Ban replied. 

Chen Ping'an continued to drink in silence. 

Tao Ban, in a bid to keep the conversation going, said, “Second shopkeeper, did you know that a lot of people talk bad about you behind your back? Many customers who come here to buy wine stand up for you. Just hearing what they say can really get under your skin.” 

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “I didn’t know. Care to share?” 

With that, Tao Ban began spilling all the gossip he had heard, recounting word for word what people were saying. 

Seeing that the second shopkeeper was just drinking and not getting angry, the child began to feel indignant and huffed, “Hey, second shopkeeper, your ears aren’t deaf, are they? Are you even listening to me?” 

Chen Ping'an laughed, “I’m listening.” 

The east wind stirred the willow fluff, and like the constant rise and fall of the willow catkins, it was meaningless to worry about such things. 

But this kind of reasoning was too dull to explain to a child, so Chen Ping'an pretended to just realize it, feigning anger as he said, “Those bastards are really infuriating.” 

The child seemed eager to do something. “Shouldn’t we do something about it?” 

Chen Ping'an lifted his wine bowl, giving him a sidelong glance. “Are you helping me fight them, or keeping watch?” 

With a sigh, Tao Ban slumped back on the table. “When there are too many customers, I complain about being tired; when there are none, I complain about being bored. What’s going on?” 

Chen Ping'an teased, “Exactly, what’s going on?” 

Tao Ban shot him an incredulous look. “You’re such a bore. You don’t even act like a storyteller anymore, and you seem to care less about the tavern. I don’t know what you’re busy with all day.” 

Chen Ping'an waved his hand dismissively. “I paid for the wine; you should at least get a plate of pickles and a bowl of plain noodles as a side.” 

Tao Ban beamed with delight. 

Liu E, who had been listening intently to their banter, quickly went to greet Uncle Feng to prepare a bowl of plain noodles for the second shopkeeper. 

Chen Ping'an sipped his wine leisurely and suddenly thought of the calamity that befell the old minister Liu from the Lion Garden in Qingluan Kingdom. 

Scholars who valued their reputation the most feared losing their good name later in life. Cui Dongshan mentioned that all those insidious schemes were devised by Liu Qingfeng, the old minister’s eldest son, with Li Baozhen from the small town merely following his lead. 

Chen Ping'an turned to glance at the various taverns lining the empty street behind him. 

In truth, what Tao Ban mentioned—the people and their words—didn’t surprise Chen Ping'an in the slightest; he could even say he had long anticipated it, much like how the engraved words on the edge of that official seal hinted that there were no surprises in the affairs of the world. 

For the current Chen Ping'an, it was difficult to be angry—disappointment had little to do with him. 

Certainly, some people who once encountered the young master Chen Sanqiu at the tavern or the Tai Xiang Street, Yuhuo Street would have flattered him but, upon receiving no return, began secretly harboring grudges against him. Since the second shopkeeper was friends with Chen Sanqiu, they would naturally hold Chen Ping'an accountable too. 

There were also those sword cultivators who looked down upon Shiedzhang’s humble origins, envious of its opportunities and cultivation, thus resenting the tavern's noise and the second shopkeeper’s fleeting glory. 

Some had ridiculed Fatty Yan in the past, but as Yan Zhuo’s realm improved, their views shifted from condescension to admiration, and they had to grapple with the fact that they now needed to look up to Yan Zhuo, who was familiar with both Ning residence and Chen Ping'an. 

There would also be those young tavern patrons trying to cozy up to the second shopkeeper, who felt that no matter how hard they tried, they never seemed to connect with him. Initially, they thought little of it, but as Chen Ping'an’s fame grew, it became a tangible loss in their eyes. Over time, they stopped visiting the tavern altogether and preferred to gossip elsewhere, sharing derisive remarks about the little tavern and Chen Ping'an, finding great satisfaction in the agreement of their peers, believing it enhanced their drinking experience. 

These people, especially as they recalled their past pretenses, while they drank with sword cultivators on the roadside, suddenly felt uncomfortable in their hearts. So, alongside their like-minded friends, they concocted stories about the tavern, growing more animated in their disdain. 

The busier the tavern became, the better its business thrived, while those who gossiped elsewhere, even if only a few surrounded them, sought reasons to console themselves, even believing that everyone else was drunk, and they were the only sober ones. In groups of two or three, they sought warmth in their camaraderie, truly becoming confidants. 

As the scripture says, “One rain nourishes all, yet every plant differs.” 

Much like the old adage that “one grain can feed a hundred kinds of people,” they essentially convey the same meaning. 

Dismissing any individual is an easy task. 

No matter if one is the Grand Sword Immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall, or a sage of Confucianism, or a philosopher among the myriad schools, anyone can be easily criticized by others, and it is simple to dismiss them. 

Anyone can do these things; it’s possible, or else they would be ostracized. But it cannot be done alone, or else they would end up mediocre, ultimately suffering the consequences themselves. 

Genuinely accepting someone, however, becomes a much more difficult endeavor. 

For Chen Ping'an, the joy now was not in competing with them but rather in taking the time to observe these individuals’ intricate lives whenever he had the chance, to witness the ebb and flow of human nature. 

He took a big gulp of wine, pouring another bowl as the last one ran dry. 

Looking at the gluttonous Tao Ban, Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Slow down, no one’s stealing your food.” 

Tao Ban ignored him. 

Chen Ping'an sipped his wine, feeling a wave of nostalgia for his hometown. 

In his childhood, in the small town, a child once climbed a tree to retrieve a kite caught in the branches and was accused of being a thief. 

He remembered a time at the Immortal’s Grave, watching his peers frolic from a distance. When someone got bitten by a snake, that child rushed to inquire about herbal remedies learned from the Yang Family's shop, helping the bitten child apply the medicine. 

Afterward, he saw the children who had once berated and thrown mud at the lone boy from Mud Bottle Alley. The ones who cursed the most fiercely and threw the hardest were precisely those who had previously interacted with that orphan. 

At that time, Chen Ping'an didn’t understand why it was this way; but as he grew older, he realized that if they didn’t act this way, they would lose their friends. 

But that didn’t stop those children from growing up to be filial to their parents, helping neighbors fetch water, and even stealing water at night. 

Some would become shameless young men, while others, with better luck, would become the sycophants of wealthy young lords from Fulu Street and Taoye Lane, seizing every opportunity to glare fiercely, striking a fearsome pose. 

Even so, this didn’t prevent some among them from receiving rewards and returning home with shabby clothes for their younger siblings, purchasing a heap of New Year goods, and having their parents prepare a hearty New Year’s Eve dinner, filled with joy and reunion. 

They would craft little toys like bamboo dragonflies and swords for their younger siblings. 

Some, however, would grow up to be entirely heartless, remaining so even after marriage and starting families. They’d live decent but unremarkable lives, never arguing over right or wrong, their family’s understanding resembling a little self-contained world, harmonious and warm. Even when Chen Ping'an became a kiln worker apprentice, he still didn’t comprehend why it was so until he traversed numerous paths and read plenty of books, gradually uncovering the reasons. 

The child from Mud Bottle Alley grew day by day, and for each encounter from his childhood, he would experience varying degrees of unhappiness and grievances. 

He could only squat alone, shaking his head in frustration, playing with grass or crafting rough little clay figures at the Immortal’s Grave. 

He would pick up a dry twig and, on the lush country roads, leap and bound alone, wielding the twig as a sword, happily slashing at imaginary foes, panting with excitement. 

He would also suffer from toothaches, with a swollen face, chewing on some crude herbal remedies and not wanting to speak for days. 

Yet as long as he was healthy, no matter if he ate one meal and skipped another, it felt like happiness. 

There were nights he couldn’t sleep, running alone to the Dragon Lock Well or beneath the old locust tree. Just gazing at the brilliant starlit sky, he felt as though he had nothing and everything at the same time. 

Eventually, that same booger-nosed kid grew up, learned to walk and talk. 

The boy from Mud Bottle Alley eventually met Liu Xianyang. 

Later, as a kiln worker apprentice, he felt a new ray of hope in life. 

He wanted to care for the little booger-nosed kids more and learn more skills from Liu Xianyang. 

Chen Ping'an wished for the three of them to always have enough to eat and wear, no matter what challenges lay ahead, whether great disasters or minor troubles, he hoped they could navigate through steadily, enduring until they found success. 

The little booger-nosed kid vowed to earn a lot of money so that his mother could wear gold and silver every day, and they would move to a house on Fulu Street. 

Then, all those who bullied them would be left trembling in fear, not needing him to seek trouble; they would slap themselves in the face, even bringing chickens and ducks to apologize. If they didn’t, Gu Can wouldn’t forgive them; for every insult he received, he would return it a hundredfold, and for every kick, he would kick back seven or eight times, sending the other rolling on the ground, nearly to the brink of death. 

Liu Xianyang aspired to become the best craftsman in all the dragon kiln workshops, mastering all of Old Yao's skills, and the porcelain he personally crafted would be placed on the Emperor’s table, cherished as a family heirloom. When he grew old, he vowed to be even more impressive than Old Yao, scolding each of his clumsy apprentices daily until they cried. 

Liu Xianyang also hoped he could break bricks with a single punch, leap across the widest creek in one stride, and that all who had studied in the academy or those who could recite a few phrases would look up to him, begging the old Liu family to write couplets for them. 

Back then, each of their dreams felt enormous, the biggest they could imagine. 

But no one anticipated that, compared to the life experiences they would later face, those once grand aspirations seemed small—perhaps even trivial. 

Yet Gu Can became the very type of person they all despised back then. 

Liu Xianyang did not become that heroic figure but rather a genuine scholar. 

Chen Ping'an, who merely wished for a stable life, didn’t find it so stable either. 

He earned plenty of money, traversed far and wide across the rivers and lakes, and encountered numerous people and events he had never dared to dream of before. He was no longer the child who once carried a large basket up the mountain to gather herbs; instead, he now carried an invisible, intangible basket filled with the countless stories he had gathered on his journey—stories both large and small, that he couldn’t bear to forget or discard. 

Some stories ended far from happy, where lovers could not be united, and kind-hearted people received no rewards. Some farewells, which at the time seemed unremarkable, would never have the chance for reunion again. 

Some stories ended well, yet also bore regrets. Some stories had yet to find their conclusion. 

But Chen Ping'an always believed that light could be found in obscurity, and hope could emerge from despair—this would be his truth. 

He set down his wine bowl, lost in thought. 

He recalled the old man Yao, who liked to walk alone with his hands tucked inside his sleeves. 

He remembered the first time he followed the old man into the mountains to search for suitable clay for making porcelain, when suddenly a heavy snowstorm hit, piercingly cold, with snow almost knee-deep, nearly freezing the thinly clothed child. 

The silent elder continued on his path, merely slowing his pace and, unusually, saying a few more words: “In winter, walking the mountain path in such cold, you’ve finally earned a bit of money, and you won’t even part with a single coin? You’d rather freeze to death?” 

“It’s cold and the road is far; can’t you just dress a bit warmer? Can’t you figure that out? Didn’t your parents teach you to think for yourself?” 

On that seemingly endless snowy path, the suffering child listened to even harsher words, unable to cry out. 

The elder never cared for Chen Ping'an’s life or death. 

However, at a moment when Chen Ping'an truly felt despair, someone caught up to him—not only bringing him a heavy bundle filled with warm clothes and food, but also berating the old man he had respectfully bowed to as not being a decent person. 

In a moment of distraction, Chen Ping'an found himself grabbed by the neck, pulled back and nearly toppled over. 

Instead of letting go, the person tightened their grip, using one hand to mess up Chen Ping'an's hair, laughing heartily, “You’ve grown quite tall now! Did you ask for my permission?” 

Chen Ping'an's eyes grew misty as he murmured, “Why did you come now?” 

In this world, the only person who could point fingers at Chen Ping'an’s life, and whom he was willing to listen to, had arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Because that person was Liu Xianyang. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 728: Without Me, Liu Xianyang, Nothing Works**

Qiu Long and Liu E were both taken aback. The second steward of the Sword Qi Great Wall had never been bullied like this before; it always seemed that he was the one doing the bullying.

For the young boy, Tao Ban, whose sole ambition was to protect the tavern business, allowing Sister Diezhang and the second steward to earn money every day was his biggest wish. Yet at this moment, Tao Ban chose to forsake the opportunity to speak out in righteousness. Silently, he carried the dishes away from the table, unable to resist glancing back. He couldn’t help but feel that the tall young man in the blue robe was truly remarkable. He wanted to become someone like him in the future, someone who would never become like the second steward, who often laughed and joked in the tavern despite being famous and making a lot of money. But when alone, he looked like he did today—heavy-hearted and far from cheerful.

Liu Xianyang released Chen Pingan, who had just moved over a bit on the bench to make space, and waved at Tao Ban. “Hey, young lad, bring over a jug of good wine and a cup. Put it on Chen Pingan’s tab.”

Tao Ban looked towards the second steward, who nodded lightly. He went off to fetch the cheapest bamboo cave wine. Although he didn’t want to become like the second steward, he figured that the steward’s business acumen—whether in selling wine, managing the tavern, or sparring—was impressive. Tao Ban thought that he could still learn a thing or two from him; otherwise, how would he ever compete with Feng Kangle for a wife in the future?

Chen Pingan, whose own wine jug still had some left, poured a cup for Liu Xianyang and asked, “What brings you here?”

Liu Xianyang didn’t rush to answer. He took a sip of wine, shivering slightly, and said with a hint of sorrow, “I really can’t get used to this so-called immortal wine brew. One life to live, and I find nothing beats sweet rice wine.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “I actually brought some sweet rice wine from Dong Shui Well, but I drank it all.”

Liu Xianyang elbowed Chen Pingan on the shoulder. “Then why the hell are you telling me?”

Chen Pingan rubbed his shoulder and continued drinking.

Liu Xianyang took a big gulp of wine, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and pointed to the street behind him with a thumbs-up. “I came here to travel with my classmates. It wasn’t until we arrived that I learned the Sword Qi Great Wall was at war again. It scared me half to death. I was worried the teachers would get too hot-blooded and try to show off their righteous spirit, dragging us to the city walls to fight demons. I just wanted to hide in the Spring Banner Studio of the Four Great Private Residences in the Upside-Down Mountain and focus on studying, occasionally glancing at those other renowned places like the Monkey Ruins, Plum Blossom Garden, and Water Crystal Palace. But the teachers and my classmates all seemed so righteous. I care about my reputation; I’d rather lose half my life than have my face bruised by others. So here I am, gritting my teeth and coming along. Of course, hearing about your exploits while at Spring Banner was the most important reason. I have to advise you, you can’t keep doing this.”

Chen Pingan said nothing, simply drinking his wine.

In this world, the most talkative person was Liu Xianyang.

Chen Pingan had learned this over many years.

Back in those days, the three of them together meant that Liu Xianyang and Gu Can would bicker and argue at the slightest disagreement, and Chen Pingan couldn’t be bothered to mediate; he’d just listen. After all, they were only a big one and a small one, so their fights weren’t going to go anywhere. Liu Xianyang seemed to have never lost an argument; he simply didn’t care about winning or losing, always cheerful and carefree. Gu Can would often seem to win the argument, berating Liu Xianyang’s ancestors for generations, yet in the end, he would be the one more upset, chasing after Liu Xianyang for a fight. When frustrated, Gu Can would grab a branch or throw pebbles, and even if Liu Xianyang ended up getting hit, he wouldn’t get mad. Gu Can once said that Liu Xianyang was worthless, living a poor, miserable life, but the one good thing about him was that he didn’t hold grudges, nor would he beat people up just because he was stronger.

During those days, the three of them, relying on each other, each had their own way of living. No one’s reasoning was greater than the other’s, and there was no clear right or wrong. Liu Xianyang liked to spout nonsense, Chen Pingan felt he didn’t understand reasoning at all, and Gu Can believed that reasoning was just about having power and wealth. Whoever had money and plenty of flunkies had the right to speak. Liu Xianyang and Chen Pingan were just two poor guys older than him, and whether they would find wives in their lives was uncertain. 

But back then, climbing trees to catch birds, going to rivers to catch fish, and planting rice together, they always had more happy times.

In between Liu Xianyang’s drinking, Chen Pingan finally asked, “How’s it been studying at the Chen family of refined scholars?”

Liu Xianyang laughed, “What’s there to say? After more than a decade, I’m still here. It can’t be worse than life in the small town, can it?”

Liu Xianyang seemed to struggle with the bamboo cave wine, taking small sips. “So I have no regrets about leaving the small town. At most, sometimes I think of the scenery back home—the fields, the messy dragon kiln, the chicken and dog droppings in the alley. I think of it, but it’s just casual thoughts. If it weren’t for some old debts to settle and some people to see, I wouldn’t feel the need to return to Baoping Continent at all. What’s the point?”

Liu Xianyang shook his head, repeating, “There’s really no point.”

Chen Pingan suddenly spoke a name, then fell silent. “Gu Can.”

Liu Xianyang scoffed, “That little snot-nosed brat always thinking you’re his dad. You really think of yourself as his father, huh? Have you lost your mind? If you didn’t kill him, then don’t feel guilty. If you did kill him, then regret it all you want. What’s going on here? Haven’t you lived your life like this from childhood? What, now that you’re skilled and educated, you think you’re a gentleman or a sage? Just because you learned some martial arts and cultivated the Dao, you think you’re a god on the mountain?”

Liu Xianyang, growing angrier, slapped Chen Pingan’s head. “Gu Can? Even a little snot-nosed brat doesn’t want to call you that anymore?!”

The more Liu Xianyang spoke, the angrier he became, pouring out wine without drinking it, cursing, “It’s just you being so fussy, always looking for trouble. If it were me, once Gu Can left the small town, no matter how capable he became, what does that have to do with me? I only know that little snot-nosed brat from Mud Bottle Lane. If he became the little demon lord of Shujian Lake, killing innocents, then let him die by his own doing. If he’s relying on doing bad things to live well, then that’s his ability. It’s the mess of Shujian Lake that caused the calamity; who’s going to stop it? What have I, Liu Xianyang, done to hurt anyone? Just because you, Chen Pingan, read a few books, you think you can hold yourself to the standards of a sage? Back then, you weren’t even considered a Confucian student; how could you act so mighty? Those Confucian sages would have flown to the heavens! I, Liu Xianyang, am a proper Confucian disciple, and with the Chen family’s ancestors lifting the sun and moon, I should have come to this Sword Qi Great Wall to kill demons long ago. Am I supposed to strangle myself with my own thoughts and suffer? I just can’t understand how you’ve become this Chen Pingan. I remember you weren’t like this as a child. You didn’t care about anyone’s business, nor did you say a word. Who taught you to be like this? That Mr. Qi from the academy? He’s dead, so I can’t blame him. Besides, respect the dead. The literary sage old scholar? Fine, I’ll curse him later. The Great Sword Immortal? Let’s not even go there; he’s too close, and I’m afraid he’ll hit me.”

Chen Pingan finally spoke, “I’ve always been the same person I was back then.”

Liu Xianyang raised his hand, and Chen Pingan instinctively dodged.

Liu Xianyang rolled his eyes, lifted his wine cup, and took a sip. “You know what I find unimaginable? It’s not that you have today’s wealth, looking rich and becoming one of the most successful among us. I always believed you would become rich—very rich. It’s not that you’ve ended up in such a seemingly glorious yet actually pitiful situation because I know you’ve always been someone who gets stuck on trivial matters.”

Liu Xianyang raised his wine cup. “What I never expected is that you learned to drink and actually enjoy it.”

He picked up the wine cup but then set it back down. He truly didn’t like drinking, sighed, “The little snot-nosed brat has turned into this. What can Liu Xianyang and Chen Pingan even do? Who doesn’t have their own life to live? There are so many things we can’t do no matter how hard we try; it’s always been like this and will continue to be. Those years we suffered the most, didn’t we get through them?”

Liu Xianyang reached out and pressed down on Chen Pingan’s head. “You’ve helped that little snot-nosed brat make up for so many mistakes. Good for you, excellent even, but I’ve read enough books to know the world lacks fools like you who seek trouble for themselves.”

Liu Xianyang gently lifted his hand, then slapped it down. “But it’s really not good that you’re still feeling so miserable. I, Liu Xianyang, am Liu Xianyang first, and then a half-baked scholar. So I just don’t want you to become that fool. This selfish desire, as long as it doesn’t harm anyone, then don’t be afraid.”

Chen Pingan said, “I know the reasoning behind it all.”

Liu Xianyang forced a bitter smile. “But you just can’t do it, or you feel you’re not good enough, right? So it’s even harder for you?”

Chen Pingan nodded. “Actually, when it comes to Gu Can, I’ve already gotten past that mental block. It’s just that seeing so many lost souls reminds me of the three of us back then. I can’t help but empathize, thinking about how Gu Can was kicked and rolled on the ground in pain, almost dying as a small child. I think of how Liu Xianyang was almost beaten to death in Mud Bottle Lane. I also think of how I almost starved to death, surviving thanks to the kindness of neighbors, so in Shujian Lake, I want to do a little more. I haven’t harmed anyone, and I can try to protect myself. If I can do something, why not do it?”

Liu Xianyang also felt miserable and slowly said, “If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn’t have left my hometown. It’s true that you can’t do without me.”

When a person has ideals, they often need to leave their hometown.

It’s a struggle to achieve a dream, but one can’t help but feel homesick in that dream.

Yet Liu Xianyang, as he said, didn’t have much nostalgia for his hometown, nor was there anything difficult to let go of.

At most, he worried about Chen Pingan and the little snot-nosed brat, but that concern was far less than what he felt for Chen Pingan.

For Liu Xianyang, living well was actually the best way to honor the old Liu family. Every year, visiting the graves with offerings, putting up door gods during the Spring Festival, and repairing the ancestral home—these things Liu Xianyang had never really cared about. He just went through the motions. Each time during the Spring Festival and Qingming, he liked to borrow some paper money from Chen Pingan. Chen Pingan had once nagged him about it, but Liu Xianyang defended himself, saying he was the only heir of the old Liu family, and in the future, he would help the Liu family flourish and continue their lineage. His ancestors would surely be smiling down from the underworld. What could they expect from a solitary descendant struggling to survive? If they truly wished to bless Liu Xianyang and thought of the old Liu family’s children, they should send him a dream, telling him where several jars of silver were buried in the town, so he could strike it rich. Then he wouldn’t just burn a small pot of paper money, but rather several big pots of paper horses and paper people.

Liu Xianyang had a big heart, so much so that he could joke about the time he was almost beaten to death. Even when the little snot-nosed brat brought it up, he truly didn’t care. The little snot-nosed brat’s heart was always pinched tighter than a needle’s eye. Many people’s grudges eventually became trivial matters, wiped away with a single stroke, but some people would keep their grudges alive, staring at the ledger forever, flipping through it endlessly, genuinely feeling satisfaction, without a hint of relief, thinking that was what true fulfillment was.

Liu Xianyang said, “As long as you’re too hard on yourself, others will be even harsher on you. The further you go, the more people will nitpick and find fault. The better the world gets, the more idle chatter you’ll hear. It’s only when the world is good that people have the energy to gossip. When the world is truly bad, everyone naturally shuts their mouths; it’s hard enough just to get a decent meal. In chaotic times, who has the spare time to worry about others’ goodness or badness? Do you understand this point?”

Chen Pingan nodded.

Liu Xianyang continued, “If you think that self-control is the most important thing and believe Chen Pingan should become a better person, then I can’t be bothered to advise you further. After all, as long as you’re alive, it’s fine. So I only ask you to do one thing: don’t die.”

Chen Pingan said, “There are too many accidents; I can only do my best.”

Liu Xianyang frowned. “Mr. Qi from the academy chose you to escort those children to study. The literary sage old scholar chose you to be his closed-door disciple. So many people from Falling Ruins Mountain chose you to be the mountain master. Ning Yao chose you to be her immortal partner. No matter how great those reasons are, they don’t justify you dying here, in this battle. To put it bluntly, none of those who chose you want you to die at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Who do you think you are? Adding one more Chen Pingan to the Sword Qi Great Wall guarantees its safety? If you take away a Chen Pingan, will it fall? There’s no such nonsense reasoning. Don’t try to pull that ‘whether Chen Pingan is here or there’ argument with me; I know you too well. If you truly want to do something, would you lack reasons? Back then, you didn’t read books, and you had your own set of reasoning. Now that you’ve read a few books, you can certainly self-deceive even more. I just want to ask you one thing: have you ever thought of leaving here alive? Is everything you’re doing for the sake of leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall alive?”

Chen Pingan said nothing.

Liu Xianyang asked, “So that means you haven’t. Relying on luck? Betting that the Sword Qi Great Wall will hold, that Ning Yao won’t die, that those new friends you’ve made here won’t die? Do you think that after leaving your hometown, everything has gone smoothly, that your luck has finally turned, and you’ve gone from the one with the worst luck to the one with the best? Have you ever thought that the more you have now, if you die, it’s all over, you’ll still be that poor wretch with the worst luck?”

Chen Pingan suddenly erupted in anger, “So what should I do?! If you were in my position, what would you do?!”

Liu Xianyang’s expression remained calm as he said, “It’s simple. First, talk to Ning Yao. Even if the Sword Qi Great Wall can’t hold, both of you need to survive. In between, do everything you can; strike with all your might. So you must ask Ning Yao what her thoughts are. Does she want to die together with you at the Sword Qi Great Wall, as a pair of doomed lovers? Or does she hope that if one dies, the other can live, considering that saving one life is a gain? Or do both of you agree to work together to ensure both can leave with a clear conscience, willing to think that even if there’s a debt today, it can be repaid in the future? Once you understand Ning Yao’s mindset, no matter what her temporary answer is, you must then ask your senior brothers and sisters what they think. What do they hope you, as a disciple of the literary sage, should do? To carry on the legacy of the literary sage or to die gloriously on the battlefield while still holding the title of a disciple? Just a matter of who dies first. Finally, ask the Great Sword Immortal Chen Qingdu if he would stop you if you wanted to live, and if he wouldn’t, could he help a little. Life and death are such major matters; what does face mean?”

Liu Xianyang pushed his wine cup toward Chen Pingan and said, “Forget it. Back then, who among the three of us had the right to care about face? When asking others for help, would they give it to you? If asking for help worked, would any of us think it was a problem? That little snot-nosed brat just wants to ask others not to insult his mother. If asking for help actually worked, how many heads do you think that little snot-nosed brat could have knocked? If kneeling on the ground and knocking your head could teach you to make porcelain, would you do it? If I knocked my head until it split open, I’d become rich and lord over everyone; do you think I wouldn’t make a big pit in the ground? What, now that you’ve become successful, the poor wretch from Mud Bottle Lane became the young mountain master of Falling Ruins Mountain and the second steward of the Sword Qi Great Wall, suddenly you don’t care about your life, just your face? I can’t afford this kind of wine. I, Liu Xianyang, have read plenty of books, yet I still don’t care about face. I’m ashamed; I can’t reach your level, Chen Pingan.”

Chen Pingan, lost in thought, reached out to push the wine cup back to its original place.

It seemed the only thing he could do was this.

Liu Xianyang grabbed that white cup and casually threw it to the ground, shattering it into pieces. He sneered, “To hell with this ‘peaceful life.’ I won’t die here, and when I return to my hometown, rest assured, I’ll go to my uncle and aunt's grave, and I’ll say, ‘Your son is fine, and your daughter-in-law is also fine, but they’ve died too.’ Chen Pingan, do you think they’d be happy to hear that?”

Chen Pingan slumped over, feeling deflated. His spirit, intent, and energy seemed to have all fallen. He just muttered, “I don’t know. All these years, I’ve never dreamt of my parents, not once.”

Suddenly, Liu Xianyang burst into laughter and turned to ask, “Sister-in-law, what do you think?”

Behind Chen Pingan, a woman, looking travel-worn, stood silently for a long time before finally speaking, “If you want Chen Pingan to die, I’ll let him die first. If Chen Pingan wants to die, I like him, but just to the point of half-death.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 729: Scholars All Around

After Ning Yao took her seat, Liu E hurriedly brought over a pot of the finest Qingshan divine wine. The young girl set down the wine pot and cups before quickly leaving, not forgetting to refill a cup for the young man with a rather bad temper. She dared not linger, and as for the matter of payment or compensation, even Liu E and the ever-business-minded Tao Ban didn’t dare to say a word.

The young boy and girl, along with Tao Ban, hid inside the shop, where previously the second shopkeeper had been speaking with an outsider in a dialect no one could understand. However, it was evident that the second shopkeeper was acting a bit strangely today.

Once Ning Yao sat down, they could no longer hear the conversation from that side.

Ning Yao poured herself a cup of wine and spoke directly, “The great sword immortal once said, ‘No one is beyond death, but it doesn’t mean anyone has to die.’ I don’t even believe that I must die here to repay the Ning residence and the Sword Qi Great Wall. So, it certainly doesn’t apply to you, Chen Ping’an. Chen Ping’an, I like you—not for the future great sword immortal you could become. If you can become a sword cultivator, that’s great. If not, it’s no big deal. You can just be an ordinary martial artist, or if you have the heart for it, you can be a scholar.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Got it.”

Liu Xianyang shook his head, lowering his voice as if speaking to himself. “You don’t really get it, do you?”

Ning Yao furrowed her brow and glanced toward the Sword Qi Great Wall. “The great sword immortal didn’t want me to say too much before. He said he would keep an eye on you and wanted you to think a bit more. Otherwise, this journey would be a waste. Finding life in death and relying on oneself is the best way to sharpen one’s Dao heart and cultivate a sword embryo. Otherwise, if others help you—even just a little support or guidance—it loses some of its meaning.”

Liu Xianyang still shook his head. “It’s not straightforward at all. I knew it would be like this. All these people who seem to have no demands are actually the ones who make the most demands of my little Ping’an.”

Ning Yao ignored Liu Xianyang and continued, “With such treatment, don’t think you’re an exception; you have to bear some responsibility. Young sword cultivators whom the great sword immortal has looked out for are not few over the past ten thousand years. Some have said a few words, but many remain unaware of it. At first, I didn’t think it made any sense, and I didn’t agree with the great sword immortal. But he encouraged me, saying he wanted to see if your heart was worth him returning that Huai wood sword box to you.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled. “I thought the great sword immortal had forgotten about that, just like proposing marriage.”

Liu Xianyang extended a finger and lightly spun the white cup on the table, muttering, “Since your swordsmanship is so high, if you’re going to give gifts to your juniors, you might as well give them plenty. It should at least match your identity and skills.”

Under the table, Chen Ping’an stepped firmly on Liu Xianyang’s foot.

Liu Xianyang pressed his fingers together as if forming a sword gesture, holding it in front of him. “Doesn’t hurt, doesn’t hurt! You turtle!”

Ning Yao wasn’t particularly fond of discussing these matters; many of her thoughts would spin around in her mind, and once they passed, they were gone—like washing or forging a sword. What wasn’t needed simply didn’t exist, while what was necessary naturally connected to the next thought, eventually becoming something she needed to do. It often manifested in swordsmanship, sword intent, and the Dao of the sword, and that was all. There wasn’t much need to articulate it.

But today was an exception.

After a moment of thought, Ning Yao said, “The great sword immortal doesn’t have too many worries now; how could he forget these things? He once said to me that he fears nothing except owing a debt.”

Ning Yao added, “When there are fewer worries, what one thinks can be greater. This is the mindset a sword cultivator should have. When a sword cultivator strikes, it should be with a clear path and bright sword light. But I also worry that I think too little, while you think a lot, yet you hardly make mistakes. I was concerned that what I said wasn’t suitable for you, so I’ve kept quiet about it. Today, Liu Xianyang has clarified things with you—fair words, selfish words, and honest words—now I feel it’s okay to say this to you. I won’t worry about the great sword immortal’s admonitions.”

Ning Yao concluded, “I have these thoughts regardless of whether the Sword Qi Great Wall can stand. We both need to live; neither of us can die! Whether we strike with swords or fists in the future, it will only happen more often because neither of us is forgetful. You don’t need to prove anything to anyone, even the great sword immortal. As long as I know, that’s enough. So, why do you feel guilty? In the future, whoever dares to bring this matter up, if you love to debate, I have never liked it. If I hear it, it’s like asking me for a duel.”

Chen Ping’an’s smile was radiant as he said, “Now I truly understand!”

Liu Xianyang slapped the table. “Sister-in-law, you speak so clearly! No wonder you could say ‘the Dao walks on its own, the sword light shines bright.’ It’s truly as I knew from the first moment I saw you that you would be my sister-in-law!”

“Liu Xianyang, this cup of wine is for you! It’s a bit late, but it’s better than not coming at all.”

Ning Yao downed her drink in one go, packed away the wine pot and cup, and stood up to Chen Ping’an. “You stay here and continue drinking with Liu Xianyang, take care of your injuries, then go kill the demons at the city wall.”

Liu Xianyang and Chen Ping’an stood up together, both smiling broadly. “If sister-in-law can say this, I feel much more at ease. It’s all my fault for leaving home too early; otherwise, who knows whether they’d call you sister-in-law or sister?”

Chen Ping’an elbowed Liu Xianyang in the chest.

Ning Yao smiled and asked, “What about that girl from Nibing Lane who liked to glance sideways at people and say strange things?”

Liu Xianyang grimaced, rubbing his chest. “Aren’t we supposed to not air our dirty laundry? The first rule of our hometown is to not poke fun at others.”

Ning Yao left on her sword, her sword energy like a rainbow.

Liu Xianyang clicked his tongue in amazement. “Who would have thought that timid Chen Ping’an would find such a straightforward and decisive wife? What a strange affair.”

Chen Ping’an withdrew his gaze, sat down, and without drinking, asked, “What’s the scholarly atmosphere like in the Chen family of Chunru?”

Regarding the Chunru Chen clan, besides the old records of Lizhu Cave and the renowned Chen Chuanan from Nanposaozhou, the only person Chen Ping’an had interacted with was a young woman named Chen Dui. Back then, he and Ning Yao had gone into the mountains with Chen Dui and the direct descendant of the Chen family from Longwei Creek, Chen Songfeng, along with Liu Baqiao, a sword cultivator from Fenglei Garden, to find a tree that held significant meaning for scholars.

Chen Ping’an’s impression of that outsider girl wasn’t particularly good or bad.

Liu Xianyang, who didn’t like drinking, ordered a bowl of plain noodles and a plate of pickles, mixed them together, and finished the noodles in just a few bites. Then he stared blankly at the empty bowl for a while before turning to ask, “Do we have to pay for these plain noodles?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “We only charge for drinks.”

Liu Xianyang suddenly realized, “I knew it! With business done like this, you’d have been killed long ago.”

Liu Xianyang recalled Chen Ping’an’s earlier question and said, “Studying over there has been quite stable for me. When I first arrived, I received several generous gifts—like the wind of turning pages and the inkfish. I later sent those to you and the little snotty nose. At the Chunru Chen clan, there were no hardships; I just listened to the teachers every day imparting knowledge and answering questions. Occasionally, I would go out to study. It was quite smooth sailing. I often went to a large cliff by the river to enjoy the scenery. After all, the Chunru Chen clan is said to be the pinnacle of all archways in the world. No place compares to our hometown; the only spot like that is the cliff by the water, somewhat resembling the Qinyu Beigou we often visited. Even if I wanted to complain to you or play the pity card, there was no chance. Compared to you, my luck is definitely better; I hope to keep it that way.”

Chen Ping’an let out a sigh of relief.

Liu Xianyang laughed, “Even if there were a little grievance like that with a little wife, do I, Liu Xianyang, really need you to stand up for me? Let’s be honest; since we became friends, who has taken care of whom?”

Chen Ping’an raised his wine cup and laughed, “You almost got killed by that old beast on Zhengyang Mountain, and wasn’t it I who vented a little of that anger for you?”

When talking to Liu Xianyang, there was truly no need to worry about face. Chen Ping’an felt he had at most half the shamelessness of Liu Xianyang.

Liu Xianyang still had one foot on the bench, tapping the tabletop with his chopsticks, and pretended to speak in a deep voice, “You’re not aware of this, but that was all part of my plan. If it weren’t for this act of self-sacrifice, how could a little muddy leg from Nibing Lane, who wasn’t even half as charming as me back then and looked like a skinny bamboo pole with a face like charcoal, have had the chance to get close to Ning Yao? You tell me, who was the biggest matchmaker between the two of you?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled lightly.

Liu Xianyang looked a bit troubled. “I didn’t expect that aside from the hometown’s glutinous rice wine, my first proper drink in life wouldn’t be with the cup of wine shared with my future wife. I’m quite the brother, I must say. I wonder if my wife has been born yet, and whether I’m getting anxious or not.”

As Chen Ping’an drank, he thought that Liu Xianyang had indeed not drunk since leaving home.

“The Chunru Chen clan is filled with good people, but some of the young people have their share of annoying habits, both big and small, which is inevitable.”

Liu Xianyang laughed, “I also made some friends while I was there. One of them came to the Sword Qi Great Wall this time; he’s the younger brother of Chen Dui. His name is Chen Shi, and he’s quite a decent person. Now, he’s a Confucian sage, so of course, he doesn’t lack scholarly energy. Being a Chen clan member, he also has some airs of a young master. There’s a lot of celestial aura on the mountain, and sometimes he shows one or two of these attitudes. Sometimes he acts like one, sometimes two, and on rare occasions, all three attitudes flare up together; it’s unstoppable.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “What’s your realm now?”

One couldn’t tell the depth of his cultivation, but it seemed Liu Xianyang was a mid-Fifth Realm Qi cultivator.

Liu Xianyang waved his hand. “Don’t ask. Otherwise, you’ll be so embarrassed you’ll cry.”

Chen Ping’an helplessly said, “As for my matters, if they reached Chunfanzhai, they certainly wouldn’t be about running a shop. You’ve heard about a few fights I’ve been in, right?”

Liu Xianyang asked, “Are you a sword cultivator now?”

Chen Ping’an could only shake his head.

Liu Xianyang continued asking, “What realm of Qi cultivator?”

Chen Ping’an didn’t want to say.

Liu Xianyang pointed at the ground. “Then why don’t you squat down and talk with Liu Dajie?”

Chen Ping’an retorted, “At least I’m a Seventh Realm martial artist.”

Liu Xianyang looked shocked. “You actually hit a girl, and you still have the face to say that?”

Chen Ping’an curiously asked, “So you’re a mid-Fifth Realm sword cultivator now?”

Liu Xianyang stretched out his hands, tugging at his collar and shaking his sleeves, clearing his throat a few times.

Chen Ping’an had already changed the subject. “Besides your friend, who else from the Chunru Chen clan came this time?”

Liu Xianyang laughed. “Why do you care about that?”

Chen Ping’an shook his sleeves and joked, “I’m a direct disciple of the Sage of Literature; the head of the Yingyin Chen clan is a direct disciple of the Second Saint. Since you’re studying at the Chunru Chen clan, according to the lineage of the righteous path of Hao Ran, how should we consider our relationship?”

Liu Xianyang laughed, “Coincidentally, the head of the Chen clan also came to the Sword Qi Great Wall, and I happen to know him. I often seek his advice on learning. As for how we should relate, I’ll ask that elder first.”

Chen Ping’an reined in his smile, feigning an awkward expression, and while drinking, he quietly said to Liu Xianyang, “Don’t rush back to Baopingzhou; staying in Nanposaozhou would be fine. Just don’t go to Baopingzhou, especially Tongyezhou and Fuyouzhou—don’t go there at all. The old debts with Zhengyang Mountain can wait a few years; by then, we’ll discuss it when the sword immortal is here. If there’s no Fifth Realm sword immortal, how can we break through Zhengyang Mountain’s protective formation? I’ve calculated that without scheming and maneuvering, even if you and I became Yujing Realm sword cultivators, it would still be difficult to gain the upper hand against Zhengyang Mountain. Their sword formation is not to be underestimated, and now they have a hidden Yuan Ying sword cultivator who has been in seclusion for nine years. Given the signs, the chances of breaking through are quite high. Otherwise, when the winds change, and the previous owner of Fenglei Garden dies, Zhengyang Mountain will surely take the opportunity to rise again. With the character of the ancestors of Zhengyang Mountain, they would never allow themselves to be humiliated by Fenglei Garden; they wouldn’t tolerate the closure of Huang He and Liu Baqiao’s progress. Fenglei Garden isn’t Zhengyang Mountain, which has strong ties with the Great Li Court. In terms of relationships at the foot of the mountain, Huang He and Liu Baqiao inherited their master Li Tuanjing’s style of living, traveling only in the world and never involving themselves in court affairs, so they are far weaker than Zhengyang Mountain in terms of connections with the Great Li Song clan. Although Master Ruan is the chief worshipper of the Great Li, both publicly and privately, they will respect and draw in, so later on, a large area was allocated to Longquan Sword Sect in the old Shanyue area. However, the emperor’s character, the young emperor would never tolerate the Longquan Sword Sect growing stronger and ultimately monopolizing power. He wouldn’t allow Master Ruan to attract most of the potential sword cultivators in the entire region. At most, they would create a standoff between Longquan Sword Sect and Zhengyang Mountain, dividing them into north and south. Therefore, as long as there’s a chance for a Fifth Realm sword cultivator to appear in Zhengyang Mountain, the Great Li will definitely spare no effort to help Zhengyang Mountain, and the strange and talented people of the Great Li will also strive to suppress the luck of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, thus hindering the Longquan Sword Sect.”

“Even if Zhengyang Mountain is a sect that has enmity with us, we cannot deny that whether as people or as mountain deities, the cultivators of Zhengyang Mountain are quite capable. Just looking at that poor girl, setting aside the grudges and enmities within, if we look purely at the result, she managed to bind Li Tuanjing with feelings throughout his life, preventing him from stepping into the Fifth Realm. Among all this, it’s certain that the patriarchs of Zhengyang Mountain told that girl many profound words that could hurt Li Tuanjing’s sword heart and Dao heart. It’s certainly not as simple as her being of poor character and betraying her deep affections; Li Tuanjing’s vision and mind would not allow him to be so disheartened. So it’s highly possible that Zhengyang Mountain made Li Tuanjing discover a truth: that girl indeed had deep feelings for Li Tuanjing, and her feelings were entirely genuine. However, in the end, that girl chose her sect, or perhaps did something that Li Tuanjing could not accept and could never let go of. Thus, after her death, Li Tuanjing remained filled with resentment for hundreds of years. A family’s values, a sect’s style—how they treat the big events and the character of those they raise, alongside the ordinary people’s habits of weighing benefits and losses, can be observed at all levels, making it hard to err. Back then, the Xu family woman from Qingfeng City was an ally with the mountain monkey of Zhengyang Mountain, yet they both plotted against each other. How is it now? Aren’t they still solid allies? In the end, it’s about shared ideals and similar temperaments; self-serving people are often more friends on the surface.”

“As for that little girl surnamed Tao back then, how are she and the son of the Xu family head from Qingfeng City now? If you’re willing to listen, I could tell you a dozen little stories right now. It’s all due to the influence of family values; it’s not surprising at all. The current Zhengyang Mountain is no longer the Zhengyang Mountain of Li Tuanjing’s day, nor is it merely Zhengyang Mountain without someone to suppress it after Li Tuanjing’s death. Today, it’s a larger situation where one region equals one nation. You and I need to consider how to cut off the ties between the Great Li Song clan and Zhengyang Mountain, how to separate Zhengyang Mountain from its numerous allies, and how to untangle the interests of the three major factions within Zhengyang Mountain before we confront them. We need to discern the character and morals of all the ancestors of the patriarchs. When the enemy is at the gates, we must infer Zhengyang Mountain’s last resort. Think it through, and then when you draw your sword, you’ll be able to strike just as hard and make the enemy suffer a hundredfold. When you draw your sword, it won’t just injure their bodies; it will also hurt their hearts—there’s a world of difference between the two. A cultivator heals and retreats into seclusion, which might even cause Zhengyang Mountain to unite against a common foe, rallying their spirits. But if you strike accurately and injure one or a few, it could cause widespread turmoil among their hearts. By that time, even if we have struck decisively and joyfully withdrawn our swords, Zhengyang Mountain will remain troubled for ten years, a hundred years, with many others continuing to draw their swords for us, each blow striking at their hearts.”

Liu Xianyang laughed, watching Chen Ping’an transform from a half-mute into a half-chatterbox without realizing it. Liu Xianyang suddenly said something inexplicable, “As long as you’re willing to live and no longer think of death as something that matters, like when I first knew you. Then stepping out of Lihua Cave is the best thing to do. Because you’re actually more suited to live in chaotic times than anyone else, and that really makes me feel at ease.”

Chen Ping’an grew anxious and shouted, “Did you even hear what I said?!”

Liu Xianyang nodded with a smile. “I heard it. I’m not deaf.”

Chen Ping’an took a swig of his drink.

Liu Xianyang teased, “Have you been pondering this all these years?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I’ve been practicing my punches and cultivation, and whenever I have some free time, I think about this.”

Liu Xianyang pointed to the wine cup. “After saying all that, you must be thirsty now.”

Chen Ping’an, with his hands folded in his sleeves, unconsciously lost the desire to drink.

Liu Xianyang laughed. “Do you really understand why Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City are like this?”

Chen Ping’an was puzzled. “What do you mean?”

Liu Xianyang countered, “Why do people harm others for their own benefit? Or not help others? Or is the temporary helping of others just a clever disguise for long-term self-interest?”

Liu Xianyang further asked, “And why are there those who act for themselves yet also help others willingly?”

He answered his own questions, “Because these are two completely different kinds of people. One rejects the world, while the other embraces it. The former pursues fame and fortune, seeking all tangible benefits; they are quite practical. Even if many of these pursuits seem unattainable to ordinary folks, they are still grounded and solid. The latter willingly help others while also benefiting themselves because they focus on the intangible and seek inner peace over material losses, deriving a deeper sense of belonging from it. Because it’s lofty and intangible, they are the most likely to feel disappointed, leading to more injuries for the former.”

“Ultimately, it’s because the former firmly believes the world is not good. If it were not so, they couldn’t survive well, while the latter believes the world can be better. So the answer is simple: the Qi cultivators of Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City, who seem to be cultivators, actually seek not the Dao but just benefits—something more tangible than that of emperors and commoners. The layers of Qi cultivators’ realms and the opportunities for treasures can manifest into countless chances of becoming immortal, and each person around them has a price in their hearts.”

Finally, Liu Xianyang said, “I can assert that after you left Lihua Cave, you’ve certainly had considerable doubts and self-reflection about the scholars and cultivators out there, ultimately nurturing a degree of rejection toward both groups.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “That’s true.”

Liu Xianyang’s words enlightened Chen Ping’an significantly. 

He truly deserved to have studied at the Chunru Chen clan for many years.

Liu Xianyang raised his cup, took a sip of wine, then put it down, unable to help but complain, “I can’t keep this up!”

Chen Ping’an was utterly confused.

Liu Xianyang continued, his words heartfelt, “Someone asked me to convey this to you; I wouldn’t have thought of these things myself. That person said that after you hear it, your heart will feel lighter, you’ll have more hope for the world, and you’ll better understand both types of people. As for who that person is, Old Master Chen didn’t mention it and didn’t let me tell you about it. He let me treat it as my own insights from learning and share them with you. I suspect that the one who wishes you well and can have Old Master Chen relay words is none other than that Sage of Literature. This old gentleman is quite a character; once, when he traveled to the Chunru Chen clan, he secretly met me, pretending to be an outsider who came here to admire the Chen clan’s ancestral hall. He then dragged me to chat for over an hour by the riverside cliff. Though it seemed like a conversation, it was mostly him rambling, aside from some trivial pleasantries. He spent most of the time scolding Old Master Chen for not having high enough knowledge, lamenting the shortcomings of the second saint’s teachings, and he was so animated that I almost fed him a couple of punches.”

At this point, Liu Xianyang raised one hand, then pressed it down with the other, smiling. “That time, when I raised my hand, the old gentleman chuckled and pressed down my hand, saying, ‘No need to act like this; let’s talk properly. We’re all scholars here; show some face.’”

Chen Ping’an rubbed his forehead.

Such things, his own teacher could indeed do.

He imagined that when the sword cultivators from Beiju Luzhou came to ask for a duel in Aiai Zhou, his teacher probably used the same reasoning.

Fortunately, the Sage of Literature’s faction, including the senior brother Qi and even the national teacher Cui Shan, didn’t act like this.

Chen Ping’an naturally thought of his student, Cui Dongshan.

This time, during the Chunru Chen clan’s study tour, Chen Chuanan personally came to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping’an believed that Cui Dongshan must have done something.

But there was no need to mention such matters to Liu Xianyang.

Just being able to meet Liu Xianyang in a foreign land was already the happiest thing.

Chen Ping’an raised his wine cup. “Shall we drink to this?”

Liu Xianyang shook his head. “I won’t drink anymore.”

He looked up at the sky. “We, the group studying here, are all staying at the home of Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan. I need to hurry over there. Earlier, I dropped my things and rushed to Ning Residence to find you, but only encountered a kind-faced old lady who said you were probably here drinking. Ning Yao must have sent for her.”

Liu Xianyang stood up and smiled. “But I should visit Ning Residence often in the future and get you to join me for drinks here because even my friends, including Chen, don’t believe I know you. They think I’m just boasting without a draft, which annoys me to no end. I don’t understand why knowing Chen Ping’an is such a big deal. Isn’t it Chen Ping’an who is the luckiest for knowing Liu Xianyang?”

Chen Ping’an stood up, laughing. “As long as you help me with business at the tavern, I can squat and drink with you; that’s no problem.”

One headed to Sun Jiansen’s residence, and the other to Ning Residence, both taking the same route. As they left the tavern, Liu Xianyang didn’t forget to pick up the broken pieces of wine cups on the floor, muttering, “May the fragments bring peace.”

Then, walking down the quiet street, Liu Xianyang reached out and hooked his arm around Chen Ping’an’s neck, pulling tight and laughing uproariously. “Next time we reach the foot of Zhengyang Mountain, you better keep your eyes peeled. You’ll see how impressive Liu Dajie’s swordsmanship is!”

The children and the young man and woman looked over there.

It seemed today, the second shopkeeper had been bullied into submission but was quite happy regardless.

### Falling Mountain

The sword immortal Shao Yunyan from Beiju Luzhou stood in a garden, where the gourd vine had surprisingly disappeared.

After parting ways with Lu Sui from Water Journey Mountain and Liu Jinglong from Taihui Sword Sect upon returning from the Sword Qi Great Wall, Shao Yunyan had entrusted this heavenly treasure to Lu Sui. He even specifically called the young sword immortal Liu Jinglong, instructing Lu Sui to send the nearly ripe sword-sustaining gourds outside Water Journey Mountain and asking Liu Jinglong to help escort them along the way. Naturally, Lu Sui refused; even though Shao Yunyan and her mentor were not divine partners, they were closer than most. However, since their sects were different and Lu Sui was a junior, how could she dare accept such a heavy treasure? Yet, Shao Yunyan insisted, leaving Lu Sui with no choice but to agree reluctantly. If not for Liu Jinglong standing beside her, Lu Sui wouldn’t have thought she could survive the return to Beiju Luzhou; such a celestial treasure involved too much destiny and fate, and even as one of the top ten young cultivators in Beiju Luzhou, she felt she couldn’t “hold” onto this connection.

In the end, Shao Yunyan smiled at Lu Sui and said, “Please tell your master that I’ve been missing him all these years.”

Today, Shao Yunyan made the unprecedented decision to leave his residence and wander around Falling Mountain’s various scenic spots.

Several of his direct disciples had already quietly left Falling Mountain with the remaining treasures and various belongings of Chunfanzhai.

Among them, one likely thought the sky was high and birds could fly freely, attempting to join forces with outsiders to hunt down Lu Sui and Liu Jinglong.

Shao Yunyan didn’t care. Whether that greedy disciple was driven by a heart of malice or believed in destiny and fate, it mattered not to him.

In the Meihua Garden, one of the four private residences of Falling Mountain, Bianjing hadn’t traveled to Boshazhou with Yan Lu and Jiang Guancheng this year but remained here alone.

A woman with plum blossom makeup at her brow, fair skin, and red lips, dressed in exquisitely elaborate clothes, exceptionally beautiful.

She was the true master of this Meihua Garden, seldom seen in public.

Bianjing referred to her as the Blushing Lady, a lovely name that matched her beauty perfectly.

While Bianjing had never been interested in matters of romance, he admitted that simply catching a glimpse of the Blushing Lady was a pleasure.

The Lady of the Blue Mountains in Qingshan Cave and the Blushing Lady of Meihua Garden—across the Hao Ran world, those ten ladies could make even the mountain deities swoon, lost in thought, captivated by their charm.

These ladies had a unique quality, as they were all born from mountain spirits or mystical beings.

The Blushing Lady sat opposite Bianjing in a waterside pavilion, playing with a bamboo pen gifted to her by Meihua Garden, intricately designed to depict clusters of bamboo, arranged with perfect density and crafted with exquisite skill. All the bamboo came from Qingshan Cave and was worth a fortune.

The Blushing Lady smiled and said, “Are you that afraid of death?”

Bianjing nodded. “I’m actually fine. I really want to go with Lin Junbi to take a look at the city wall, but the other one is so mysterious and insists I hide. She says she calculated something and that if I’m careless, it would lead to great misfortune.”

Bianjing asked, “So, who proposed opening that new door first? What does that great deity from Falling Mountain think?”

The Blushing Lady replied, “You really don’t need to worry about that. Whether it’s the old door or the new door, even if the entire Falling Mountain were to disappear, they would still exist.”

Bianjing wondered, “Is there really a sword immortal acting as an insider, willing to help us guard the door?”

The Blushing Lady glanced at the young man. “Is that so strange? If it were you, would you find it satisfying to see others laugh at those who have been dead for ten thousand years while you’ve been sitting there? You could endure it for a day, two days, a year, or two, but after dozens of years or hundreds of years? Those with good temperaments wouldn’t become sword immortals.”

Bianjing nodded. “If it were me, I would return double.”

At the tavern, the young shopkeeper had been living in this place for generations, squatting on the threshold and teasing a passing dog.

The sun was warm, making the lazy even lazier, in another boring and peaceful era of tranquility.

### Outside Falling Mountain

That Jiao Long Ditch certainly didn’t have just a few small fish and shrimp left. Even for Earth Immortal cultivators, it remained an insurmountable forbidden ground, forcing them to take a long detour.

Further away, a sect named Yulong Sect, marked by statues of rain deities and divine generals, stood firmly, and the Water Crystal Palace on Falling Mountain was its private residence.

Aside from the enormous Yulong Sect, the vast sea was dotted with numerous mountain cultivators occupying islands, each with their own rise and fall.

On the route of the cross-sea ferry from Osmanthus Island, one of the highlights was passing through the gap beneath the towering golden statues of the deities.

It’s said that the golden general with a sword supporting his hands was an ancient deity who guarded the southern gate of heaven, while the indistinct figure with colorful ribbons was the supreme deity of rain deities, nominally overseeing all true dragons’ movements and rains in the world. After being reshaped by the Yulong Sect’s founder, it seemingly still retains some control over the southern water routes.

This Yulong Sect, where two deities stood against each other, has a long-standing tradition. Female cultivators selecting divine partners must toss secret embroidered balls from their sect, which cannot be snatched away even by those of the Fifth Realm. Earth Immortal cultivators cannot use their divine arts to seize them. However, if a Fifth Realm cultivator acted, it would provoke the entire Yulong Sect.

More than ten years ago, a fortunate young Qi cultivator passed through the gap while riding the Osmanthus Island ferry, just in time to catch the embroidered ball tossed by the Yulong Sect’s fairy. He was swept away by the ball and ribbons, as if ascending to the heavens, and not only did he gain a beautiful partner, but he also successfully advanced to the Golden Core realm, becoming the fastest Earth Immortal to break through in Yulong Sect’s history. 

This young man, named Fu Ke, was indeed a person with a deep connection to the Yulong Sect. Originally an unremarkable little cultivator, after practicing the ancestral celestial techniques of Yulong Sect, he soared skyward, not only winning the affection of a beautiful woman but also successfully stepping into the Golden Core realm.

After ascending to a higher status, Fu Ke’s approach to dealing with people was vastly different from those raised in Yulong Sect, thus he was even more valued.

Today, Fu Ke stood at the foot of a statue, looking out at the distance, his spirits high. In just over a decade, he went from a financially struggling young man to an immortal among immortals.

Some friends he had shared hardships with came to visit him, but since Yulong Sect didn’t allow outsiders to enter the island, Fu Ke would take the initiative to welcome them, settling them in the subordinate forces of Yulong Sect. If they wished to return home, he would provide them with a generous sum to ease their journey; if they didn’t want to leave, Fu Ke would help them find a position or title in other island sects.

When a Yulong Sect senior wished to travel to the Sword Qi Great Wall but was stopped by their elders, Fu Ke would accompany them in silence, drinking together without much talk.

Over the years, Fu Ke had a sense of being surrounded by endless glory but sometimes felt a sense of disconnectedness, often reflecting on the harsh circumstances of his past. He would think about the other passengers on that boat from Osmanthus Island, and he was the only one who stood out, rising to the top.

However, in the depths of his heart, Fu Ke harbored a small knot: he had long heard that after he departed from the boat on Osmanthus Island, another boy from Baopingzhou, who also managed to perform divine arts in Jiao Long Ditch, had not died and gained considerable fame. What’s more, that boy with the surname Chen seemed to be luckier than him. Not only was he at the Sword Qi Great Wall, but even news from Water Crystal Palace at Falling Mountain relayed many accounts about him. This made Fu Ke smile and even speak well of the Sage of Literature and that young man while secretly nurturing a thought: it would be better if Chen Ping’an died at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Of course, Fu Ke had no enmity with that person.

If that person were to die, how would the world continue to function?

Fu Ke smiled faintly, feeling in high spirits as he turned to leave, continuing his cultivation. As long as he advanced a step further, becoming a Yuan Ying cultivator, the future position of sect leader of Yulong Sect would be one step closer to him. Who knows, perhaps in the future, Fu Ke might even have the opportunity to take a sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall as his new partner.

Little did he know.

The path of the Dao is vast.

With lush water plants and countless roaming fish, it might even nurture dragons.

When the time comes to change, and the water dries up, they will all be exposed to the sun until death.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 730: Learning the Sword

After Chen Ping'an returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he chose a secluded section of the wall to guard, covering an area roughly one mile long.

Generally speaking, below the realm of Jade Purity Sword Immortals, only nascent soul sword cultivators are afforded such treatment, allowed to wield their swords independently and protect a specific area. For instance, Qi Shou had just successfully broken through to the nascent soul realm after his closed-door training.

Qi Shou became the first among his peers to ascend to the nascent soul realm during this significant year for budding sword immortals at the Sword Qi Great Wall. This was an unbreakable rule of the Sword Qi Great Wall—a mark of honor.

Thus, even Ning Yao had to cooperate with Chen Sanqiu and the others when wielding their swords. Pang Yuanji and the Marquis of Gaoye were no exceptions; however, the width of the sections they were responsible for was greater than that of ordinary nascent soul sword cultivators and could rival that of many sword immortals.

Chen Ping'an was an exception, and he did not attract any criticism because he had not broken the rules. He was not yet a sword cultivator but simply a martial artist who had raised a few flying swords.

Moreover, Chen Ping'an willingly put himself in danger, acting as bait to draw the attention of lurking great demons. Ning Yao said nothing, nor did the others. Even the old sword immortal Yao Lianyun from the Yao family remained silent, and naturally, the other sword immortals at Sword Qi Great Wall would not impede him.

Coincidentally, Chen Ping'an and Qi Shou found themselves as neighbors.

Qi Shou was busy controlling his sword when he glanced at Chen Ping'an. Today, the latter's face was not obscured by the usual chaotic masks; instead, he wore a green robe and a formal robe over it, with a long sword from the sword workshop resting across his knees. The two celestial weapons he had earned for slaying Li Zhen had yet to make an appearance.

Now, at the beginning of the offensive and defensive battle, the many innate flying swords of the sword immortals were like a tide, positioned at the front lines of the battlefield, obstructing the demon army from the wild wilderness. Only after that came the stragglers, which required earth immortals and sword cultivators to wield their swords against the enemies. Should any demons miraculously survive after breaching the second sword array, they would face a swarm of middle-stage five-realm sword cultivators' flying swords crashing down.

This was essentially a practice drill for sword cultivation at the Sword Qi Great Wall. From cave-dwelling realm to Dragon Gate realm sword cultivators, even if their realms were temporarily low, they would become increasingly familiar with the battlefield and develop a deeper connection with their innate flying swords. Thus, their sword strikes would naturally become swifter with time.

Qi Shou shifted his gaze back to Chen Ping'an's sword strikes.

When Chen Ping'an had fought Li Zhen, Qi Shou was in closed-door training and had not had the chance to witness it firsthand, only hearing about it later. Even for someone as prideful and skilled as Qi Shou, it was a significant regret.

Today, when Chen Ping'an wielded his sword, he held nothing back. Four flying swords shot out together, seemingly relying on some newfound skill of illusion, constantly changing their appearances. While the fifth-stage and nascent soul-level demons could easily see through such rudimentary illusions, they were sufficient to hinder the charging demon army on the battlefield. The demons' advancement would be slowed, and they would find themselves in dire straits.

There was a slight nuance; the demons at the forefront would face death first, causing many of them to involuntarily slow down.

In contrast to Chen Ping'an's intense concentration, Qi Shou dealt with the enemies more easily, maintaining his focus on the battlefield's flow.

The demon army from the wild wilderness was suffering heavy casualties, but they were still far from the wall. For Qi Shou, who had experienced three major battles, handling the situation was effortless. Furthermore, he possessed three innate flying swords, with the Flying Swallow being exceptionally swift. In one-on-one combat, he had the advantage, especially suitable for prolonged battles, and he was not intimidated by the demons' thick hides and resilient physiques. As for the most mysterious of his flying swords, the Jumping Pearl, it had received an excellent prophecy from a Taoist sage: "Sitting amidst the stars, the rain falls upon the world." This was akin to the innate flying sword of the great sword immortal Yue Qing, "Lark in the Sky," and Yao Lianyun's flying sword that could create cloud seas, "Deep in the White Clouds," which excelled at dealing massive damage to enemies.

Thus, although Qi Shou had just ascended to the nascent soul realm, guarding a small section of the wall was quite easy for him. In general, sword cultivators at any level—whether sword immortals brimming with spiritual energy or mid five-realm sword cultivators with relatively thin spiritual energy—would reach a critical moment where they needed to be cautious. At that point, the dangers on the wall would multiply, and the number of sword cultivators who had to retreat or fell in battle would increase.

Whether it was demon cultivators who had already embarked on the path of cultivation or those who had yet to transform into human forms, as long as they were unlucky or dared to change their charge, entering Qi Shou's territory would result in being slaughtered by his Flying Swallow.

Qi Shou's methods of killing with the Flying Swallow were notoriously cruel, delighting in exploiting the demons' flesh and bones, leaving them in a state worse than death.

For those relatively difficult to deal with, he used his second flying sword, the Heart String. The longer the standoff lasted, the slimmer the opponent's chances of survival became, as it afforded the Heart String an opportunity to accumulate strength. This flying sword could strike faster than the Flying Swallow and could autonomously seek out the enemy's key acupoints with the subtle flow of spiritual energy within its small cosmos on the battlefield.

Qi Shou glanced at the battlefield littered with corpses, reminiscent of his first time on the wall witnessing such scenes. He couldn't help but ask a question during a lull in the battle: Why were these beasts unafraid of death?

A sword immortal chuckled and answered, "There is no one unafraid of death; it's just that in the wild wilderness, life is the least valuable. Even for cultivators, it's the same—only by becoming a sword cultivator can one change their fate and become valuable, making it less likely to die at the wall's foot."

For now, Qi Shou had not yet used that Jumping Pearl; it wasn't necessary at this moment.

The battle between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the wild wilderness was never about a particular sword immortal's extraordinary prowess or the shocking true forms and divine abilities of a great demon; it was always a war of attrition. It depended on who could exhaust whom. The wild wilderness had countless lives to expend, while the Sword Qi Great Wall relied on the spiritual energy stored by every sword cultivator. The first to falter would be the loser.

In the last significant year for the Sword Qi Great Wall, the budding sword immortals had sprouted like mushrooms after rain, and the reason they almost lost everything was that the wild wilderness had nearly endured until the end. After that painful lesson, more and more intercontinental ferries headed to Upside-Down Mountain, and the Nalan and Yan families of the Sword Qi Great Wall began to rise, growing their businesses with the world of the righteous, fervently purchasing spirit pills and talismans that sword cultivators had previously looked down upon, just in case.

With just a trip to Upside-Down Mountain via the ferries, a lucrative business could be made. In the nine continents of the world of the righteous, new immortal families emerged, thriving and wealthy, including the Liu family from Aiai Continent, the Shanshui Cave from Fuyun Continent, the Qionglin Sect from Beiju Continent, the Old Dragon City from Baoping Continent, and the Yulong Sect, an important transit hub, among others.

Separated by Chen Ping'an was a female sword immortal from Aiai Continent, Xie Songhua, who had only arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall last late winter. Her reputation was not prominent; she resided in the private residence of a sword immortal between the wall and the city, called the Su Yuan Mountain House. Since she had just come to the Sword Qi Great Wall and had no military exploits to her name, she was merely a temporary resident. Xie Songhua hardly interacted with outsiders and rarely showed up at lively gatherings.

At this moment, after she summoned her innate flying sword, her aura could only be described as mediocre. The flying sword moved neither fast nor slow, and the sword light and intent were ordinary, as if she could only manage to kill enemies with it.

Qi Shou couldn't help but glance at the bamboo sword box behind Xie Songhua.

She was likely the one assisting Chen Ping'an in fishing, rumored to be merely a Jade Purity realm cultivator. This puzzled Qi Shou; if any demons took the bait, and Xie Songhua committed herself to strike, surely a big fish would bite. Wouldn’t Xie Songhua, even being a Jade Purity realm sword immortal at a bottleneck, drag Chen Ping'an down in the process? Could it be that Xie Songhua was the type of sword cultivator who pursued extreme one-strike lethality? Such strange sword immortals had existed in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall, but they were few. They excelled at direct confrontations, relishing life-and-death duels. After one such duel, if the opponent survived, it often became their own demise. Therefore, such sword immortals tended to have short lives at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

From right to left stood Qi Shou, Chen Ping'an, and Xie Songhua, each guarding their respective territories.

None of them had replacement sword cultivators behind them.

During the period, Fan Dache snuck over once, but did not dare linger, leaving a jug of wine before running off.

Chen Ping'an opened the wine jug, taking small sips while remaining attentive to the movements of the demons on the battlefield.

Unlike Qi Shou's nearly brutal methods, Chen Ping'an aimed for a single fatal blow, at the very least ensuring each strike could injure the demons' physical forms or impede their movements. This was a situation of necessity; after the battle with Li Zhen, he had fallen three realms. Although his spiritual foundation was still quite decent, the Water Mansion could no longer rely on refining water pills to recover its peak state. If he were to exhaust his spiritual energy recklessly, it would only exacerbate the fractures that had a chance to mend and hasten the peeling of the mural of the Water God. The small pond beneath the Water Mansion would also begin to leak. In simple terms, while the Water Mansion could previously hold one pound of water energy, it could now only accommodate three or four ounces. If his sword intent were depleted too much and his spirit worn down, relying on the remaining spiritual energy as a last resort would only trap him in a vicious cycle. Using postnatal pills to replenish the Water Mansion's spiritual energy would lead to a great waste, ultimately resulting in the squander of invaluable shenze water god palace water pills.

This was not the most troublesome issue.

After the grand refinement, even though Song Pin and Ke Lei were merely imitating the sword of hatred mountain, their flying swords were sharp enough but lacked the unique innate abilities of true flying swords. To some extent, this was true for the first and fifteenth days; whether one was a sword cultivator or born with innate flying swords made a world of difference. Nearby, Qi Shou did not need further elaboration; Chen Ping'an had personally experienced the sharpness of his three innate flying swords. Just the Gu Jianlong's poison sword was a genuine innate flying sword of the highest rank. Thus, as long as it injured the enemy, it would often lead to their death. Once the poison sword truly harmed an opponent, its sword intent could permeate the enemy's acupoints, making it extremely difficult to deal with.

However, resolving troubles was the essence of cultivation.

Carefully controlling the spiritual energy consumption of the four key acupoints, he worked on repairing the foundation of the Water Mansion, Mountain Shrine, and Wooden House. Each acupoint was nearing complete depletion of spiritual energy. For instance, the Water Mansion resembled a dried-up pond, revealing many flaws that became even clearer, prompting him to immediately shut the doors and cease using this source of spiritual energy. The green-clad children began to get busy, acting as seamstresses. At the Wooden House, a Yin God guarded, while a golden little figure assisted in patrolling the Mountain Shrine. The looming battle left no time for Chen Ping'an to cultivate and recuperate in the city. Therefore, he had to make do, using the battle to sustain the fight and actively seeking out every minor flaw in the foundations of his cultivation. Even if this meant reducing the effectiveness of the pills stored in the Ning family treasury and the shenze water god palace water pills, he would not be overly concerned.

Slaughtering demons on the battlefield could also earn money.

Especially since the Sword Qi Great Wall had a very favorable written rule for Chen Ping'an; killing a demon, whether it was a golden dan demon or not, would yield far greater rewards for sword immortals than for mid five-realm sword cultivators. 

Thus, this time, Chen Ping'an was killing demons to earn money as a second realm cultivator.

The hidden officials serving as supervisors and recorders, along with the Confucian faction, had no objections to this.

The realm he had lost was earned through his own abilities, and the bait he acted as was also deserved rewards that both sides felt Chen Ping'an had rightfully earned.

While appearing focused on controlling his four swords to slay enemies, Chen Ping'an also kept an eye on the combat of the two sides. Qi Shou, now a nascent soul cultivator, wielded his sword with a stark contrast to the earlier street battles.

As for sword immortal Xie Songhua’s strikes, they were even more unadorned, relying solely on the sharpness of her unknown innate flying sword to display its lethality, which allowed Chen Ping'an to gain further insights.

After all, Chen Ping'an was not a pure sword cultivator. The mental and spiritual energy consumed in managing the flying swords was far more exaggerated than that of a sword cultivator. The resilience of a gold body realm physique was beneficial, strengthening his soul and spirit, yet ultimately could not compare to the sword cultivator's strikes.

And the tide of the demon army showed no sign of stopping.

Thus, Chen Ping'an needed to drink often; there was much to be learned from the wine.

Beside him, Qi Shou watched with amusement, thinking it was truly a hardship for this young man, who was trying to bluff his way through. He hoped he wouldn't collapse under the pressure before a big fish bit.

However, the pale-faced youth's eyes grew increasingly bright. Setting aside the strain of managing the flying swords for long durations, it was Chen Ping'an's tenacity and clever choices in handling many details that made Qi Shou regard him with newfound respect. Although they nearly exchanged lives as opponents, Qi Shou was not petty enough to wish for Chen Ping'an to suffer injury after injury, ultimately damaging the roots of his path.

Thus, Qi Shou spoke with his heart, "If you don't mind, you could deliberately let a group of beasts charge past your four swords. That way, I could use the Jumping Pearl to harvest some battle achievements. Otherwise, if this continues, you won't be able to hold the battlefield."

Chen Ping'an, now merely a second realm cultivator, could no longer exhibit the ripples of his heart’s voice. He could only rely on the martial artist technique of gathering sound into a line to speak with Qi Shou, "I appreciate the goodwill, but for now, I need to make things tougher for myself to have a chance at catching a big fish. After that, even if you don't speak, I'll still ask for your help."

Wasting a couple of water pills, or even worsening the situation at the four key acupoints, would make it harder for him to strike. However, if he could successfully hook a fifth-stage demon, it would be a huge profit.

That's how the account would be settled.

The Aiai Continent's female sword immortal Xie Songhua, as Qi Shou had guessed, was indeed the kind of sword cultivator who pursued extreme sword intent. Throughout her life, she had dedicated herself to the pursuit of a single strike that could clarify the heavens and the earth.

Xie Songhua was straightforward. After the top sword immortal chose her to assist Chen Ping'an, she had an open and honest conversation with him, stating directly that she came to the Sword Qi Great Wall merely to hunt one or two great demons to showcase her sword. Once she achieved her goal and gained benefits and fame, she would immediately return to Aiai Continent.

This made Chen Ping'an feel a bit more at ease.

Qi Shou asked with a smile, "Why not ask that allied sword immortal Xie Songhua for help?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Owing a favor to a sword immortal is something I cannot neglect, and returning it, whether more or less, is a significant dilemma. But a favor owed to you is much easier to repay. This battle is destined to be prolonged, and in the end, who owes whom a debt is still uncertain."

Qi Shou found Chen Ping'an as irritating as ever. After a moment of silence, he tacitly agreed to Chen Ping'an's approach and then curiously asked, "How much of your tough situation is genuine?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "You won’t believe whatever I say, so why bother asking?"

Qi Shou feigned helplessness, saying, “I’m not busy; as a nascent soul sword cultivator, I have no worthy opponents. It’s rather lonely.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "I could let a nascent soul sword cultivator and a sword immortal stand guard; that would be even lonelier."

Qi Shou raised a middle finger.

Chen Ping'an took another sip of wine, the jug containing a unique bamboo cave winery brew, hiding its secrets.

The wine from the sword-raising gourd at his waist had melted a water pill, and he would only drink this wine in a crisis. The jug of wine that Fan Dache occasionally delivered helped replenish his spiritual energy, so for now, he had no worries. As for the precious pills among the fifteen square inches, they were more targeted, mainly to address the declining spiritual energy at the Mountain Shrine and Wooden House.

The battlefield was full of oddities.

Suddenly, a sea of clouds enveloped the battlefield within a hundred miles. From a distance atop the wall, a bright light surged, breaking through the cloud cover and creating a streak of light that fell back into the clouds, crashing to the ground like thunder.

Some demon cultivators, having stealthily avoided the first sword immortal's array, suddenly revealed their true forms, all clad in silver armor, leading the charge. They could send flying several earth immortal sword cultivators' flying swords, attempting to forge a symbol array that would not stand on the battlefield but rather descend into the depths of the earth before being targeted and slain by a sword immortal.

The great demon, led by the Rebirth of Light, revealed its massive form, tirelessly tossing mountains like siege engines seen on the mundane battlefield of the world of the righteous.

Moreover, a nameless great demon, stopping high in the winds, held a translucent white jade vial, pouring its contents down towards the Sword Qi Great Wall's wall, unleashing a torrent of water that cascaded like a white curtain but did not touch the ground, colliding with the surging sword energy of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

There was also a great demon lurking deep underground that suddenly broke through the soil, revealing a true form hundreds of feet long, like a dragon or a snake, attempting to destroy many mid five-realm sword cultivators' innate flying swords in one fell swoop. However, a great sword immortal, Li Tui, sensed it instantly and struck it back with a sword, causing the massive body to submerge back into the earth, trying to retreat from the battlefield. As the flying swords pursued, the ground shook, and the brilliance of sword light underground was so vivid that even through the thick soil, one could still see dazzling sword lights.

There were also roaming demon cultivators who, having avoided the sword immortal's flying swords, found themselves at the front of the second sword array. They suddenly threw out what looked like gravel, resulting in hundreds of towering skeleton puppets clad in armor appearing on the battlefield, attempting to catch the innate flying swords. Once a flying sword fell into their grasp, it would explode immediately. Due to their position at the edge of the two sword arrays, the bones and armor would scatter violently, injuring only the edge of the flying sword of earth immortal sword cultivators. Yet, many mid five-realm sword cultivators' innate flying swords would be directly pierced or even shattered.

When truly in the battlefield, some sword cultivators forget the passage of time, or conversely, they live each day in fear, feeling as if years were passing.

Day and night alternated.

The three moons from the wild wilderness, familiar to the Sword Qi Great Wall, seemed to grow brighter, as if the moonlight was increasingly drawn towards the battlefield, especially favoring the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Qi Shou glanced at Chen Ping'an, reminding him, "Be careful; if you keep this up, you might just exhaust yourself and only be able to withdraw your swords."

If it were merely ordinary strikes against enemies, Chen Ping'an's mental energy consumption would not be this large.

This required Chen Ping'an to keep his heartstrings tightly wound, prepared for the unexpected. After all, some great demon lurking somewhere, ready to strike at any moment, could easily inflict damage—if not for killing, then to destroy Chen Ping'an's four flying swords. For Chen Ping'an, this would be a severe blow.

Chen Ping'an raised his sword-raising gourd and took a big swig of wine, quietly saying, "So, what both sides are competing in is patience and acting skills. If they dare not gamble big to win big, and truly push me to the edge, I’ll simply withdraw my flying swords and call for reinforcements. At worst, I won't play the bait anymore."

On the battlefield, the air was filled with the remnants of wandering spirits, constantly shattered by sword light—another form of tragic devastation.

As the corpses piled high, and the battlefield was repeatedly crushed by sword immortals' strikes, the land would not be permitted to stabilize under the wild wilderness’s formations. It would not be allowed to build up the battlefield freely. However, that pervasive bloody stench and the resentment of the demons would inevitably grow stronger, even if sword immortals and innate flying swords had their countermeasures in place. Using the unique abilities of their flying swords to cleanse the atmosphere of carnage, over time, it would still be challenging to halt the accumulation of a certain ominous trend, causing sword cultivators' originally clear vision of the battlefield to gradually blur.

This was a battle for the right timing.

In contrast, the demon army from the wild wilderness charged into the fray, increasingly losing their rationality and fear of death. More and more demon cultivators, upon stepping onto the battlefield, exhibited a purer resolve to die.

The so-called heroic sacrifice was not limited to the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Thus, the Taoist sage stationed in the heavens pulled a thread from his white whisk and tossed it towards the ground. Without warning, a torrential downpour fell upon the battlefield, refreshing the atmosphere.

Immediately, a towering great demon sitting in the sea of clouds emerged, resembling a noble lady from the world of the righteous, stunningly beautiful. Adorning her wrists were two bracelets, one white and one black, with shimmering light swirling within, elegantly suspended without touching her skin, while colorful ribbons gently swayed around her. Her long hair was similarly held by a series of golden hoops that seemed to bind it but were actually floating and rotating.

She took out an ancient scroll from her sleeve, gently unfurling it. The scroll depicted continuous mountain ranges, densely packed with mountains and flowing waters, seemingly capturing the essence of nature through divine abilities, rather than simply being painted.

This grand demon, dressed in a Danxia robe, smiled brightly as she produced a seal, exhaling a breath of true essence onto the inscription. She pressed it gently onto the scroll, causing the inscription to emit a brilliant glow. However, the originally vibrant blue-green landscape of the scroll began to dim.

Pushing the scroll lightly, she left the embossed red character in place as the entire scroll instantaneously vanished.

In the air above the battlefield appeared a magnificent mural stretching a thousand miles long and a hundred miles wide. Not only that, but the mural also spread out its spiritual energy, attempting to intercept the torrential rain.

The rain fell upon the blue-green mural.

On the battlefield, no drops of rain touched the ground.

However, rain imbued with spiritual energy began falling in the actual wild wilderness mountains depicted in the mural.

The old man waved his whisk and shattered the mural, causing it to reform. Thus, the previous thread of rainwater from the whisk fell onto the battlefield once more, only to be obstructed by the mural again, and then the old man smashed the mural with his whisk.

As the inscription before the woman grew dimmer and dimmer, ultimately shattering, she smiled, "The old immortal's gift is generous; I won’t be polite."

As the woman drew out the seal again, a sword light that tore through the heavens rushed forth. The black and white bracelets on her wrists, along with the golden hoops binding her hair, flew out on their own, colliding with the sword light and igniting a dazzling spark, showering the ground with fire rain.

Although the woman blocked the sword light, she was forced to retreat a hundred miles, looking down at the bracelets on her wrists. Fortunately, there was only minor wear, so she stopped using the mural to block the rain and continued to observe the battle from a distance.

The one striking from the Sword Qi Great Wall was Lu Zhi.

She remembered.

Once the woman bore a grudge against another woman, she would often become even more ruthless.

When Chen Ping'an had no choice but to withdraw all his flying swords, he ultimately didn’t manage to hook a great demon, which was both unexpected and unsurprising.

Xie Songhua and Qi Shou needed no verbal communication; they immediately teamed up to help Chen Ping'an slay the demons, each sharing half of the battlefield to allow Chen Ping'an a moment to rest before re-engaging.

The great battle had just begun, and most of the demon army now seemed like ants, filling the battlefield with their lives. The number of cultivators was not significant, even less than in the previous three major battles. This time, the wild wilderness's siege was more patient; the array of sword cultivators connected seamlessly, each playing their part. However, the demon army's assault seemed to exhibit an inexplicable sense of order, no longer entirely rough. Still, throughout the battlefield, there were occasional coordination issues, as if the behind-the-scenes commanders lacked enough experience.

Sword cultivators trained their swords, while demons practiced their martial skills.

In the sky of March, an unfamiliar old man dressed in Confucian robes appeared beside the Confucian sage, gazing up at the three moons.

This elder was the foremost figure of Nan Posa Continent, the refined scholar Chen Chunan.

Chen Chunan withdrew his gaze and smiled at the distant group of exchange students, "Go help out. Remember to adapt to local customs."

A group of young people dispersed.

The Confucian sage from the same sub-saint lineage remarked, "There are many seeds of learning here."

Chen Chunan replied, "Such fine materials, we have plenty in Nan Posa Continent."

The Confucian sage smiled, "After all, this isn’t the world of the righteous. Here, if you want to converse with the top sword immortals, you must do something noteworthy."

Chen Chunan nodded, raising a hand high.

The bright moon in the wild wilderness seemed to tremble slightly, as if it were about to be pulled towards this elder, only to be tucked into his sleeve.

A great demon with a throne materialized out of thin air, positioned between the bright moon in the sky and the elder on the wall.

Chen Ping'an returned to his position on the wall, continuing to wield his sword, while Xie Songhua and Qi Shou relinquished the battlefield back to him.

A tall young man in Confucian robes sat quietly beside him, saying nothing to disturb Chen Ping'an’s sword strikes; he merely stared at the chaotic battlefield for quite some time before finally saying, "You just pretend to be weak; let them come in closer, the nearer to the wall, the better."

Chen Ping'an hesitated not at all and withdrew his four flying swords.

He allowed the demon army within his domain to surge forward.

Liu Xianyang closed his eyes, as if entering a dream.

Qi Shou glanced at the seemingly sleeping stranger and then at the tumultuous battlefield of demons.

Just as Qi Shou was about to summon the Jumping Pearl, Liu Xianyang opened his eyes.

On the battlefield defended by Chen Ping'an, all demons perished, with none surviving.

Even sword immortal Xie Songhua couldn’t help but turn to look at Liu Xianyang.

Because she hadn’t sensed the slightest ripple of spiritual energy, nor any trace of sword intent appeared, and even on the battlefield, there were no signs of sword energy.

Chen Ping'an cautiously observed the suddenly silent battlefield; it was truly dead silent.

Liu Xianyang seemed to find it unbelievable, rubbing his chin and murmuring, "Is it this easy to beat?"

Just as Xie Songhua and Chen Ping'an felt a flicker of thought simultaneously, Qi Shou muttered, "Here they come!"

Only carrying a long sword from the sword workshop on his back, Liu Xianyang exclaimed. The long sword behind him unsheathed on its own, arcing through the air. In the sky, an unknown golden deity appeared, wielding the ordinary long sword. As it descended to the earth, ancient sword intent from the Dao converged upon the figure. The sword-wielding deity ultimately struck down, smashing a slender sword light that burst forth from the corpses and shot towards Chen Ping'an. That sword light, not far from the wall, was sent crashing to the ground, and both the golden deity and the sword workshop’s long sword dissipated in midair.

Xie Songhua's sword box behind her unleashed beams of sword light, moving with astonishing speed that was breathtaking.

In the end, she successfully shattered the innate flying sword of the demon sword immortal beneath the earth.

Xie Songhua only recalled half of the sword lights back into her sword box, standing up and turning to Chen Ping'an. "Chen Ping'an, for now, you must rely on yourself to survive. I need to rest for a while; otherwise, I won’t be able to kill a fifth-stage demon, which would be meaningless to me."

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement.

Liu Xianyang turned to approach Xie Songhua, seemingly preparing to take her place in guarding.

Chen Ping'an hesitated, wanting to say something.

As Liu Xianyang passed behind Chen Ping'an, he bent down and patted Chen Ping'an's head, grinning, "Old rules apply; learn from this."

Since the day they met and became friends, Liu Xianyang had consistently taught Chen Ping'an various things. Even after being away from home for over a decade, this remained unchanged.
