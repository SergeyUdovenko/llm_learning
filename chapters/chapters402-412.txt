### Chapter 402: The Young Master and the Young Girl

The old Confucian scholar returned the pass document to the young man named Chen Ping'an.

The scholar had a very good impression of him.

He glanced again at Chen Ping'an, who was carrying a long sword and a book box on his back, and found him quite pleasing to the eye.

Carrying a sword and a book, traveling thousands of miles in pursuit of knowledge, was indeed something we scholars did best.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Sir, do you know a little girl named Li Baoping? She likes to wear a red cotton jacket and a red skirt.”

The old scholar chuckled, “Who in our academy doesn’t know this girl? Not only is she well-known among all of us here, but she’s probably explored every corner of the grand capital of the Great Sui. Every day, she’s so full of energy that it makes us old folks, who can barely walk, envious. And look at that! She’s skipped class again today to sneak out of the academy. If you had arrived just half an hour earlier, you might have run into little Baoping.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Did she leave the academy alone?”

The old scholar nodded, “Every time.”

Seeing the worried expression on Chen Ping'an’s face, the scholar reassured him, “Don’t worry. The little girl has gone out countless times without any issues. After all, she is a disciple of our academy. Besides, the capital of the Great Sui has always been stable, with honest folk. The Minister of Rites is also the head of our academy, and he often comes to this Little Dongshan to have tea with several deputy heads. Nothing will happen.”

Only then did Chen Ping'an feel slightly relieved.

The old scholar asked, “So, this visit to the cliffside academy is to find little Baoping? According to your pass document, you’re also from Longquan County in the Great Li, so you’re not only her fellow townsman but also a relative?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Just a fellow townsman, not a relative. A few years ago, I came to the grand capital of the Great Sui with little Baoping and the others, but back then, I didn’t ascend the mountain to enter the academy.”

The old scholar found it a bit strange. When those children from Longquan County entered the new Cliffside Academy, they first sent elite cavalry to escort them to the border, and later, even the Emperor personally visited the academy in a grand ceremony. He looked very pleased and bestowed gifts upon all the traveling students. This young man named Chen Ping'an, by rights, should have at least caught a glimpse of the academy, even if he didn’t enter.

The old scholar asked, “Are you planning to wait here for Li Baoping to return to the academy?”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

He certainly hoped that the first person he would see at the Cliffside Academy would be little Baoping.

He also wanted to see Li Huai, Lin Shouyi, and Yu Lu and Xie Xie, especially the youngest, Li Huai.

But none of them could compare to the little girl in her red cotton jacket and skirt. Chen Ping'an never denied his selfishness; he was closest to little Baoping. Their time studying in the Great Sui was like that, and later, when he went off to the Upside-Down Mountain alone, he only sent a letter to Li Baoping, asking her to help deliver other letters to them. The painting he received from the Fan family artist on the peak of Osmanthus Island was also given only to Li Baoping, not to Li Huai or the others.

This kind of distinction in closeness was something Lin Shouyi, Yu Lu, and Xie Xie surely understood, though they might not care. Lin Shouyi was a refined scholar, and Yu Lu and Xie Xie were important figures in the Lu Dynasty.

As for Li Huai, who was skilled at home turf advantage, he probably still thought that whether it was Chen Ping'an or Ah Liang, they were closest to him.

The old scholar waved his hand with a smile, “I advise you all to first go to the guesthouse in the academy to drop off your things. Little Baoping usually sneaks out, and even if she leaves early in the morning, she won’t return until dusk. There’s never been an exception. If you wait here at the gate, you’ll have to wait at least three hours—it’s unnecessary.”

After thinking for a moment, Chen Ping'an turned to look at Pei Qian and the others. If he were alone, he wouldn’t mind waiting here.

He glanced down the street.

Zhu Lian had been observing the academy buildings behind the mountain gate. Built against the mountain, they were newly constructed by the Ministry of Works of the Great Sui, yet they exuded a sense of simple elegance.

This Cliffside Academy, relocated from the Great Li to the capital of the Great Sui, was one of the seventy-two Confucian academies of yore that had once flourished across the world.

It was the first Confucian academy Zhu Lian had encountered since leaving the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

A place where sages taught, filled with the sound of reading, its reputation spread throughout the land.

When the Cliffside Academy was first built under the Great Li, the first headmaster proposed an enlightened precept for learning, advocating that knowledge and contemplation should be grounded in action.

As Zhu Lian surveyed the academy, Shi Rou dared not even breathe.

Though Shi Rou resided in a guise of an immortal’s molted shell and could withstand the invisible righteous Qi, her instinct as a ghostly entity still filled her with trepidation.

Pei Qian remained silent, seemingly even more anxious than Shi Rou.

When they had disembarked in Longyu City, Pei Qian had boasted about wanting to meet Li Baoping. Yet by the time they reached the gates of the Great Sui, she began to feel uneasy.

Standing at the gate of the Cliffside Academy only heightened her apprehension.

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, “May I inquire, sir? If we check into the academy guesthouse, do we need to notify Master Mao in advance and wait for a reply before visiting?”

The old scholar chuckled, “Actually, notifying him isn’t very meaningful. Master Mao doesn’t enjoy receiving guests. In recent years, he has almost turned down all visits and social engagements. Even when the Minister arrives at the academy, he may not meet with Master Mao. However, since you, Young Master Chen, have come from afar and are also from Longquan County, a simple greeting should suffice. Although Master Mao is strict in his studies, he is quite amiable. It’s just that scholars of the Great Sui have always emphasized the esoteric, which makes it hard for them to connect with Master Mao.”

Chen Ping'an still did not enter the academy immediately, asking, “If I remember correctly, isn’t the security and order of the Great Sui capital overseen by the Military Commander’s office?”

The old scholar understood, realizing he was still worried about Li Baoping. He smiled, “That’s right. Moreover, the son of the chief officer of that office is currently studying in the academy.”

Chen Ping'an felt relieved again.

After inquiring about some trivial matters regarding Li Baoping, he bid farewell to the old scholar and entered the academy.

Pei Qian walked with heavy steps, especially after passing through the gate; the gently sloping mountain path felt like wading through a river or trudging through snow.

The academy had a guesthouse specifically for accommodating relatives and friends of the students. Years ago, Li Er and his wife, along with their daughter Li Liu, had stayed in the guesthouse.

The academy only symbolically charged a small fee of ten wen per day per room. Learning that there weren’t many guests currently, Chen Ping'an requested four adjacent rooms all at once.

They each placed their luggage, and Pei Qian came to Chen Ping'an’s room to copy books.

Chen Ping'an took down the bamboo box, even removing the sword gourd from his waist along with the half-immortal weapon, the “Sword Immortal.”

Zhu Lian came to ask if they wanted to explore the academy together, but Chen Ping'an said he wouldn’t go for now, and since Pei Qian was busy copying books, she ignored Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian then knocked on Shi Rou’s door. Feeling uncomfortable, Shi Rou was in a bad mood, while Zhu Lian stood outside saying flowery yet crude things, prompting Shi Rou to throw him a scathing remark.

Zhu Lian had no choice but to wander the academy alone.

———

Li Baoping probably knew this capital city better than the locals who had been born and raised here.

She had visited the southern gate known as the Grain Gate by the locals, where the grain transported via the canal was inspected by officials before being stored in warehouses, making it the convergence point for food from all directions. She had squatted at the dock for half a day, watching the busy officials and clerks, as well as the laborers sweating profusely. She also knew that there was a flourishing fox spirit shrine there—neither a sanctioned temple by the Ministry of Rites nor a lewd shrine, but a place with a strange origin, housing a fox tail that gleamed as if brand new, an old woman selling talismans and water sprinkled with strange incantations, and an old man who was said to be a bone-reader from the western region of the Great Sui, who often quarreled with the old woman.

She had gone to the Longfu Temple Fair, where the crowd was overwhelming. She had seen a type of snake made from cow horn and felt envious. Many wealthy people came there, including those servants who looked even more arrogant than the children of nobles, wearing dyed black rat fur coats to masquerade as mink.

Li Baoping had also visited near the imperial city, where she spent many afternoons learning that many porters and embroiderers, who were not palace staff, could also enter and exit the imperial city, as long as they carried waist tokens. Among them was the Wenhua Pavilion, which compiled the histories of various dynasties and employed many scribes and paper makers.

She had made more trips to the northern back gate of the imperial city, called the Earth Last Gate, as it was livelier there. Once, she witnessed a raucous scene in a silver shop, where soldiers were capturing a thief, creating quite a stir. Later, when she asked the nearby shopkeeper, she learned that the shop, while not clean in its dealings, was a den for selling stolen goods, where items pilfered from the imperial palace were quietly sold, including some hidden sachets and even tin sheets used to repair the palace’s drainage system. The leftover scraps from palace repairs were coveted by merchants outside, and many reports of losses and damages from the manufacturing departments proved to be highly profitable, especially in the gold and jade craftsmanship, which were often smuggled out of the palace and turned into real money.

Li Baoping hadn’t quite understood at the time how anyone dared to steal from under the Emperor’s nose. The old shopkeeper, who had become friendly with her, chuckled and said, “There are people who will engage in head-losing business, but no one would do a losing business.”

Li Baoping had also been to the nearby Embroidered Robe Bridge, where there was a large lake, though it was obstructed by the walls of various royal and high-ranking officials’ residences. The Military Commander’s office was located in a place called Fur Hat Alley, and Li Baoping had strolled back and forth several times while eating pastries because there was a classmate she didn’t like who always boasted that his father was the biggest official in that office, claiming that even if he urinated on the stone lion there, no one would dare to stop him.

Li Baoping had also been to the southern part of the city, known as the Zhongguan Alley, where many elderly eunuchs and white-haired palace maids lived after leaving the palace to enjoy their twilight years. There were many temples and Daoist halls there, although they were not large. The eunuchs and palace maids devoted themselves entirely to their worship with utmost sincerity.

Thus, Li Baoping often saw hunchbacked old men being supported by servants or walking alone with crutches to burn incense.

After wandering so many times, Li Baoping learned that the most senior palace maid, revered as the Grandma of the Inner Court, was a long-serving maid serving the Emperor and Empress. Among them, the old palace maid who combed the Emperor's hair every morning held the highest status, and some were even granted the title of “Madam.”

On the eastern side of the capital, there was the largest marketplace in the Great Sui, bustling with shops, traffic, and people, where money flowed like water. Among them was Li Baoping’s favorite place to browse, a bookstore. Some daring bookstore owners would secretly sell books that, according to imperial law, could not be exported or allowed to leave the borders. Delegates from various vassal states often sent servants to make private purchases, but if they were unlucky and encountered a patrol, they would be dragged off to the magistrate’s office.

In these three years.

Whether clad in a cotton jacket or a dress, the little girl in bright red had helped many elderly people who were struggling to burn incense, comforted crying children under trees, retrieved kites stuck in branches, pushed carts stuck in the snow with a charcoal load alongside tattered old men, watched older folks playing chess at street corners, tiptoed in antique shops to inquire about the prices of the items, and sat on steps under the overpass listening to storytellers. Countless times, she brushed past vendors calling out to sell their goods, and even mediated fights among children who were tangled together on the ground…

The little girl had heard the melodious dove calls above the capital, seen the swaying, beautiful kites, tasted what she felt were the best dumplings in the world, sheltered under eaves from the rain, hid under trees from the scorching sun, and warmed herself in the cold wind and snow…

Today, Li Baoping had gone to browse the bookstore again. On her way, she had eaten lunch at a small, cheap restaurant, and on the way back, she stopped at a family-run noodle shop. The old shopkeeper and the owner’s wife were quite familiar with her and often said they would charge her less or even not at all. However, Li Baoping had never agreed, saying she might want them to charge less next time. But as time went by, the two restaurants never got that chance, and they eventually assumed the little girl was just being polite and didn’t want to reduce their small profits. Yet, they secretly wanted to smile, as they encountered such a lovely and considerate customer; even though making money was hard, they wouldn’t mind losing a few coins.

In the dusk.

Li Baoping’s rushing figure appeared on the street outside the Cliffside Academy.

The little girl thought the saying in books that time flies like a shuttle and a white horse passing through a crevice seemed not quite right. Why was it so slow for her? It was making her anxious!

A little girl in a red skirt, whose eyes seemed to only see far ahead, quickly greeted the old scholar at the gate and dashed past.

The dozing old man suddenly remembered something and called out to her retreating figure, “Li Baoping, you’re back!”

Li Baoping did not stop, waving her hands as she stepped back, glancing at the old scholar who was waving at her, then she ran backward—surprisingly quickly…

Li Baoping retreated back to the gate, stopped, and asked, “Mr. Liang, is there something you need?”

The curious Mr. Liang asked, “Did you run into any acquaintances on the way?”

Li Baoping widened her eyes and shook her head, “Nope.”

Mr. Liang smiled and asked, “Then did you not come in from the direction of Baimao Street today?”

Li Baoping nodded, “That’s right, what’s the matter?”

Mr. Liang, still smiling, asked, “Baoping, before I answer your question, you must first answer mine: Do you think my knowledge is great?”

Li Baoping thought for a moment, “A bit less than Master Mao’s.”

Mr. Liang was momentarily rendered speechless by this honest little girl.

However, looking at it from another angle, comparing herself to a sage of the Confucian academy was, after all, a compliment.

Thus, Mr. Liang felt quite good and informed Li Baoping that a young man had come to the academy looking for her. He had stood at the gate for quite a while before heading to the guesthouse to drop off his luggage. He came back here twice, the last time was half an hour ago—he came and didn’t leave.

Mr. Liang chuckled, “I advised him not to worry. Our little Baoping is familiar with the capital as if she were wandering around her own home, so she can’t possibly get lost. But the fellow still paced back and forth on this street. I was worried for him, so I told him that you generally come from Baimao Street, and it’s likely he’s waiting for you over there. Not seeing you, he wandered a bit further down the street, hoping to catch a glimpse of you. That’s why you two missed each other. Never mind, just wait here; he’ll surely return soon.”

Suddenly, Li Baoping turned around and prepared to dash off.

Mr. Liang hurriedly said, “Little Baoping, are you going to look for him on Baimao Street? Be careful! He might have already gone far from Baimao Street looking for you, and if he doesn’t come back the same way, won’t you miss each other again? Are you two planning to play hide and seek?”

Li Baoping, anxious like an ant on a hot pot, turned in circles.

This was a scene the academy scholars had never witnessed before.

Li Baoping was on the verge of tears when she suddenly shouted, “Little Master Uncle!”

The old scholar’s heart skipped a beat; he narrowed his eyes, and his demeanor changed completely, gazing toward the end of the street.

A figure in white, resembling a white rainbow, turned in from Baimao Street, then rushed forward with even greater speed, arriving in an instant.

When the young man gracefully came to a stop, his white sleeves billowed like the wind, resembling a carefree immortal.

He stood before the little girl in red, beaming with a bright smile, and gently said, “Your little master uncle has arrived.”

*(End of Chapter)*### Chapter 403: At the Academy

Li Baoping had a lot to say, but when she finally met Chen Ping'an, all the words that were ready to spill out just fell back into her stomach.

Chen Ping'an reached out and gestured at Li Baoping's forehead, "You've grown quite a bit, haven’t you?"

Li Baoping hopped slightly and, with a frown, said, "Little Master Uncle, how come you grew taller than me so fast? I can’t catch up!"

Chen Ping'an gently wiped the tears off the little girl's face, but she suddenly rushed into his embrace, catching him off guard. He could only hold her gently and chuckle; it seemed she hadn’t grown up all that much after all.

The old Confucian named Liang observed this scene, feeling as if he was admiring the most refreshing and heartwarming painting in the world, like the spring breeze brushing against the willow trees, the green mountains meeting the clear waters.

There’s a saying that goes well: "When the golden wind and the jade dew meet, it surpasses countless encounters in the human realm."

Thus, the old Confucian was quite happy, chuckling to himself.

After greeting the old Confucian, the duo entered the academy.

Li Baoping flitted around like a little yellow oriole, chattering non-stop as she introduced the happenings within the academy to Chen Ping'an.

When they reached the guest quarters, Chen Ping'an spotted a tall elder standing at the entrance with Pei Qian, who was quietly gaping and mouthing the word "Mao."

Having wandered around the jianghu for a while, Chen Ping'an instinctively raised his fists in salute but quickly withdrew, opting to bow respectfully to the vice master of the Mountain Cliff Academy, Mao Xiaodong.

Mao Xiaodong nodded in acknowledgment and stepped forward, "Chen Ping'an, we need to talk."

This left the twelve-year-old Li Baoping and the eleven-year-old Pei Qian standing at the entrance of the guest quarters.

One wore a red dress, the other looked like a little black lump.

Li Baoping looked at Pei Qian, who was unsure where to place her arms and legs. She lowered her head, not daring to meet her gaze.

Li Baoping circled around Pei Qian, then returned to her original position and asked, "So you’re Pei Qian? Little Master Uncle said you are his first disciple and that you’ve traveled a long way together?"

Pei Qian nodded, her head downcast.

Li Baoping continued, "Little Master Uncle said you have a great talent for martial arts and are quite clever. He also said you can endure hardships just like I did back then, and that your biggest dream is to ride a little donkey and roam the jianghu?"

Pei Qian lifted her head, glanced at Li Baoping, and then lowered her head again, nodding.

Li Baoping thought for a moment and said, "Alright, I’ll give you two things as a meeting gift, come with me."

Pei Qian swallowed hard, hesitating to move. Although she knew that this girl in the red dress wasn’t a bad person, she was still afraid of being led into a dark alley where Li Baoping might just throw a sack over her head and dump her somewhere in the Great Sui capital.

Li Baoping had already turned to run a few steps when she noticed Pei Qian standing there like a wooden puppet. She kindly said, "Little Master Uncle mentioned a lot about you and said you were timid. Okay, let’s put this yellow paper talisman on your forehead and then we can go."

Pei Qian quickly took out a talisman for suppressing monsters and slapped it on her forehead, gaining a bit of courage as she slowly walked forward.

Li Baoping was quick on her feet, but to accommodate Pei Qian’s pace, she had to take tiny steps, swinging her arms like she was on a swing, running backward to stay next to Pei Qian. "Pei Qian, you’re Little Master Uncle’s first disciple! Even if you’re in unfamiliar territory and scared of meeting strangers in the academy, you have to pretend to be brave. Besides, with me here, no one will dare bully you, so don’t worry."

Pei Qian managed a smile and handed Li Baoping a guiding light talisman, clearly trying to win her over first before worrying about her earlier bravado of competing with Li Baoping in arm wrestling, which she had long since forgotten.

But as soon as she took it out, Pei Qian regretted it, feeling it might make Li Baoping look down on her. To her surprise, Li Baoping grabbed it right away, wet her finger, and slapped it on her forehead with a hearty laugh.

Pei Qian couldn’t help but laugh along.

Having seen through the tricks of the Grandmaster of Taiping Mountain, Pei Qian could also perceive the fluctuations of human emotions. Some people were like blobs of ink, their hearts pitch-black; others were like paste, muddled and indecisive. For instance, the ghost Shiro was like a sudden storm yet only had a barely visible golden seed within her, just sprouting with a hint of green. On the other hand, Zhu Lian was particularly frightening, with blood rains and lightning, but there was a vague image of a beautiful pavilion amidst it all, exuding grandeur.

However, some people... were as clear as crystal, like this girl in red, making Pei Qian feel particularly ashamed of herself.

Seeing that Pei Qian was still moving slowly, Li Baoping decided against rushing back to her own guest quarters and chose to accompany Pei Qian for a leisurely stroll, casually asking, "I heard from Little Master Uncle that you ran into Cui Dongshan. Did he bully you?"

Pei Qian didn’t dare to tell the truth and simply replied that it was okay.

Li Baoping made a gesture as if grabbing something and blew on it, "This guy really needs a beating. When he gets back to the academy, I’ll help you get back at him."

Pei Qian turned to sneak a glance at Li Baoping, suddenly filled with admiration.

Besides her master, from Old Wei and Xiao Bai to Sister Shiro, even that hulking demon cow, who wouldn’t be afraid of Cui Dongshan? Pei Qian was even more terrified.

Cui Dongshan’s heart seemed to harbor a vast, dark abyss—one that wasn’t stagnant but rather shadowy and uncertain, where she saw the so-called dragon she’d read about in books, its shadow gliding slowly. Each time the dragon neared the water's surface, it sent ripples that chilled her heart. Fortunately, next to the pool piled up golden and silver books, making it seem less eerie; otherwise, Pei Qian wouldn’t dare interact with Cui Dongshan.

The tall elder with the ruler hanging at his waist was the true backbone of the Mountain Cliff Academy—Mao Xiaodong.

Mao Xiaodong led Chen Ping'an to his study, hardly exchanging any pleasantries along the way.

Once seated, Mao Xiaodong suddenly smiled, stood up, and bowed to Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an quickly moved aside, feeling he certainly didn’t deserve such an unexpected display of respect.

After rising, Mao Xiaodong said, "If it weren't for your protection back then, the literary heritage of our Mountain Cliff Academy would have suffered greatly."

Chen Ping'an didn't know how to respond.

Mao Xiaodong explained, "There were too many eyes and ears outside earlier, so it wasn't convenient to speak more personally. Little Junior Brother, I've been waiting for you for quite a while."

Chen Ping'an smiled wryly and was about to say something.

Mao Xiaodong waved his hand, "We're all family here; we know what’s on each other's minds."

Chen Ping'an sat down helplessly.

Mao Xiaodong smiled as he observed Chen Ping'an, extending his hand, "Little Junior Brother, let me see your travel document. I’d like to learn from it."

Chen Ping'an stood again and handed over the travel document with both hands.

After receiving it, Mao Xiaodong chuckled, "You should thank Little Junior Brother for taming that brat Cui Dongshan. If he weren't worried about your potential visit to the academy someday, I bet he would have turned the Little Dongshan and the Great Sui capital upside down."

Chen Ping'an replied, "Actually, Cui Dongshan still fears the Sage of Literature; my relationship with him isn’t that significant."

Mao Xiaodong tapped Chen Ping'an’s shoulder, "Little Junior Brother, with your demeanor, you remind me so much of our master back in the day. The greater the achievement, the more humble the words to us disciples. ‘Oh, it’s nothing, just a small matter, just some words of encouragement.’ You all should refrain from excessive flattery, as if our master accomplished some grand feat for the benefit of the people. I was the one who out-argued the ancestor of the Dao, and you all are so excited. Did you think our master wouldn’t win? Did you feel surprised when he did? You, Mao Xiaodong, are laughing the loudest; go outside with the others and read in the yard as punishment. Oh, and remember to remind the others to sneak out over the wall to bring a late-night snack for Xiao Qi. He’s at that age where he’s growing fast, so make sure it’s not too greasy; otherwise, it’ll keep him awake at night..."

Mao Xiaodong rambled on about the past with their master, laughing heartily.

Chen Ping'an felt a headache coming on.

Why did it feel more difficult to chat with him than with Cui Dongshan?

Chen Ping'an asked, "I heard from Elder Liang that Lin Shouyi has made great progress, so there's no need for concern, but it seems Li Huai has been struggling with his studies. Is he finding it very exhausting?"

Mao Xiaodong smiled, "With Li Huai's cheerful temperament, he could play with his painted puppets and clay figures even if the sky were falling. He might even be happy today because he finally doesn’t have to listen to the lectures of the Confucian scholars. You needn’t worry about Li Huai; even if he is always at the bottom of his classes, I haven’t seen him eat or drink less. Last time, his parents and sister visited the academy and left him some silver. He didn’t waste it recklessly; he just got caught one time by the night duty Confucian while he was with two classmates, using a bowl to hold water instead of wine, while the three of them nibbled on roasted chicken legs. After getting punished, Li Huai was still half full. When the Confucian asked him whether the punishment or the chicken leg was tastier, guess what he said?"

Chen Ping'an struggled to suppress his laughter. "If getting punished means you can eat chicken legs, then the punishment is delicious. But I bet after saying that, Li Huai got a whole feast of punishment."

Mao Xiaodong gave a thumbs-up. "As expected of the one who escorted them, Little Junior Brother, you really understand Li Huai the best."

Mao Xiaodong continued, "Although Li Huai is a bit slow in picking up from books, he isn’t dumb. Many of his peers can only memorize texts, but as long as Li Huai gets it, he truly understands it. Therefore, the teaching Confucians actually think quite highly of him; every time he’s at the bottom, they don’t say much."

Chen Ping'an tentatively mentioned, "He needs to be more diligent in his studies and not slack off; those principles need to be conveyed."

Mao Xiaodong’s eyes lit up in appreciation. "That’s how it should be. Back then, after Li Er caused a ruckus in the palace, everyone was terrified. The Confucians liked Li Huai more and were genuinely worried that Li Er was too protective. For a while, they didn’t dare say a harsh word to him, so I had to lecture those Confucians, and after that, things got back on track. Punishments should be administered when needed; that’s the state a disciple of our master should be in."

Chen Ping'an asked, "After that incident, did any of those children have any lingering issues they didn’t notice themselves?"

Mao Xiaodong laughed, "With me around, and with that scheming Cui Dongshan keeping an eye on things, there haven’t been any problems. Such things are inevitable; it’s part of learning to behave and studying to understand principles, so there’s no need to overreact."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Being flexible and not going to extremes. But it seems the academy head has to worry a bit more."

Mao Xiaodong complained, "Is it that hard to call me Brother Mao? Do you think I’m so far behind Qi Jingchun and the others, even less than Cui Qian and Cui Dongshan, that you’re reluctant to call me Brother Mao?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "It’s not like that; I hope Brother Mao can understand."

When it comes to the literary heritage, Chen Ping'an couldn’t afford to be overly polite or dismissive.

Mao Xiaodong appeared somewhat unsatisfied but secretly nodded.

If a so-called sage from the Mountain Cliff Academy were to be overly courteous, they might change their minds after a stern face.

Calling him Brother Mao would be justified, but being the master’s closed-door disciple, Qi Jingchun and the others might not be suitable.

One could see the subtleties in this.

Mao Xiaodong had some discernment in this regard.

Back in the day, among the four direct disciples of the Sage of Literature, the first disciple Cui Qian was the most learned and talented, Qi Jingchun had the deepest and most orthodox knowledge, and the ones who upheld "the Dao flows on its own," the Left and Right, were late bloomers with the highest cultivation, while one seemed dull and slow but was actually the sage’s favorite besides Qi Jingchun. In fact, the three or four that had lost in competition back then had gradually faded into the background, and except for the renowned "Left and Right accompanying the master," that person had always followed the master and stayed with him to the end, accompanying him in self-imposed seclusion within the Grove of Meritorious Deeds. However, it was unclear why, back then, the second disciple and the fourth disciple had parted ways.

Among the named disciples, Mao Xiaodong and his peers certainly didn’t stand out.

This shows how much attention the Sage of Literature attracted back then, with a brilliant literary tradition.

Mao Xiaodong felt a twinge of regret, as the romanticism was often swept away by the rain and wind.

Qi Jingchun left the Central Plains and came to Baoping Continent to establish the Mountain Cliff Academy. Outsiders said it was to counter the former senior brother Cui Qian, who bullied his master, but Mao Xiaodong knew it wasn’t like that at all.

The Left and Right had become even more resolute, directly distancing themselves from the mundane world, setting sail alone to seek immortality.

That rumored giant who had once chased Ah Liang around the streets had also fallen silent for over a hundred years.

Mao Xiaodong retracted his chaotic thoughts and finally focused his gaze on this young man.

Now, the master had taken in this disciple, who inherited the knowledge of the literary heritage.

In the nearly three years since Chen Ping'an had passed through the academy without officially entering, Mao Xiaodong had been both curious and worried. He was curious about what kind of literary seed the master had taken in and worried that this young man, hailing from Lihuzhu Cave and cherished by Qi Jingchun, might disappoint.

However, as Mao Xiaodong observed Chen Ping'an’s every word and deed from afar with the authority of a Confucian sage stationed at the academy,

He felt neither astonished nor disappointed.

He simply thought that this young man named Chen Ping'an, from a humble background, was precisely the kind of disciple the master would take in, and it was only right that Qi Jingchun would take him on as a disciple.

Afterward, Chen Ping'an also inquired in detail about Lin Shouyi's cultivation and studies, wondering if there would be any conflicts.

He asked if Gao Xuan and Yu Lucheng becoming friends would lead to any insincerity.

He inquired if the mindset of Xie Xie, who became Cui Dongshan’s maid, would become problematic.

Mao Xiaodong answered each question one by one while occasionally glancing at the travel document.

Once he understood everything, Chen Ping'an finally felt a sense of relief.

Mao Xiaodong then asked with a smile, "You’re thinking so much about your own matters and others’, aren’t you tired?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head honestly, "Not at all."

Mao Xiaodong nodded and softly said, "Studying and practicing martial arts are actually the same; both require accumulation of energy. A gentleman acts greatly when the time is right, but when it isn’t, they’re like dragons and snakes. Thus, when we brainstorm together, and if a brilliant idea strikes, it seems like a dazzling talent descends from the heavens, something the world has never seen."

Chen Ping'an felt that this statement was a bit grand, making him a bit uneasy.

Suddenly, Mao Xiaodong asked quietly, "Has the master mentioned me?"

Chen Ping'an hesitated, still answering honestly, "It seems... he hasn’t mentioned you."

Mao Xiaodong slapped his knee, exasperated, "Is there really such bias in this world?!"

Mao Xiaodong, still not giving up, asked, "Think carefully again; could it be that you missed something?"

Chen Ping'an resolutely shook his head.

Mao Xiaodong stroked his beard and smiled, self-assuredly saying, "I suppose the master has a disciple in his heart, so he doesn’t need to mention it frequently."

Chen Ping'an felt a sense of calm within.

This Mao Xiaodong was undoubtedly a disciple groomed by the Sage of Literature himself.

Perhaps feeling that Li Baoping was easier to get along with, Pei Qian began to walk faster and lighter.

However, when Pei Qian arrived at Li Baoping’s study, she was taken aback by the stacks of copied texts on the bed, almost dropping to her knees in awe.

No wonder Pei Qian had just mustered up the courage to boast a little about copying books each day, to which Li Baoping had simply responded with an "oh" and nothing more. Initially, Pei Qian felt she had finally regained a bit of face and even felt a little proud, straightening her back slightly.

Li Baoping poured a cup of tea for Pei Qian and invited her to sit casually.

She climbed onto the bed, moved the little bamboo box from the wall to the table, and took out the narrow sword "Xiangfu" and the silver gourd that Ah Liang had gifted her.

Li Baoping said, "This is for you."

Pei Qian looked at the narrow sword and the small gourd. Now that she had some knowledge, she looked up at Li Baoping and asked a redundant question, "They must be very expensive, right?"

Li Baoping didn’t bother to hide the truth and said straightforwardly, "Ah Liang told me privately that this Xiangfu sword isn’t particularly good; it’s a so-called half-immortal weapon. But this little gourd, which was swindled from the Sword Immortal Wei Jin at the Wind and Snow Temple, is truly valuable. It’s one of the seven sword-nurturing gourds from the gourd vine that Dao Ancestor personally planted during his early years of cultivation. Sword cultivators who use this to nurture their flying swords will be considerably stronger. Pei Qian, you’ve already started learning the sword, so use it well!"

Pei Qian felt her tongue tie as she stammered, "But I just started practicing the sword and am doing it quite carelessly. I’m not a sword cultivator; my innate flying sword or anything, I’m rather slow, and I might never be able to cultivate it..."

Li Baoping asked directly, "So do you like the Xiangfu and the little gourd?"

Pei Qian timidly nodded.

Li Baoping scratched her head and sighed inwardly.

Why did Little Master Uncle end up with such a silly and clumsy disciple?

Pei Qian grew increasingly anxious, her eyes darting toward the stacks of books on the bed and then glancing at the narrow sword and the silver nurturing gourd on the table.

Suddenly, Pei Qian had a lightbulb moment, whispering, "Sister Baoping, such a precious gift, I can’t accept it. My master will scold me."

Li Baoping blinked, "Then just tell your master that I’m lending them to you. Whether it’s for a year, ten years, or even a hundred or a thousand years, it’s still a loan. I won’t ask for them back, and you can confidently take them into the jianghu, right?"

Pei Qian lowered her head, "Oh, right."

Li Baoping changed her position and sat on the long bench next to Pei Qian, comforting her, "Don’t feel stupid; you’re still young. I heard from Little Master Uncle that you’re a year younger than me."

When Pei Qian heard this, it made sense to her, and she immediately raised her head and laughed, cautiously asking, "Sister Baoping, can I touch them?"

Li Baoping suddenly stood up, startling Pei Qian, but then she gestured for Pei Qian not to panic and told her to watch closely.

As a result, Pei Qian saw Li Baoping swiftly draw the sword from its sheath, holding it in both hands, taking a deep breath, and swinging it down at the gourd.

Pei Qian watched with wide eyes, looking like a little goose caught off guard.

Li Baoping’s chop was quite bold, but the gourd was so smooth that it flew toward Pei Qian, hitting her in a reflexive slap.

The silver nurturing gourd went “thud” as it hit Li Baoping's face.

With a bang, the gourd fell to the ground.

Li Baoping, momentarily stunned, started bleeding from her nose.

Pei Qian felt she was doomed.

At this moment, Li Baoping still held the Xiangfu sword, and it seemed highly likely that her next chop would be aimed at Pei Qian's head!

Unexpectedly, Li Baoping raised her hand, casually wiped her face, sheathed the Xiangfu sword with ease, and lightly picked up the nurturing gourd, placing it back on the table.

After sitting down, Li Baoping smiled brightly at Pei Qian, "Pei Qian, that block and slap you just did was beautiful! Very much in the spirit of the jianghu! Not bad at all; you’re worthy of being my Little Master Uncle’s disciple."

Pei Qian, with a mournful face, pointed at Li Baoping’s nose and said dazedly, "Sister Baoping, you’re still bleeding."

Li Baoping wiped her face again and looked at her palm, realizing she was indeed bleeding. Unfazed, she dashed to the bed, tore a piece of paper from a roll, ripped it into two balls, tilted her head, and stuffed them up her nose, casually sitting back down next to Pei Qian. Pei Qian’s face turned pale, making Li Baoping puzzled—why did it feel like the gourd had smashed into this girl's face? Even if it did, it didn’t hurt that much. Li Baoping rubbed her chin, scrutinizing the dark-hued little Pei Qian, thinking that this disciple of Little Master Uncle had some rather peculiar ideas; even she, Li Baoping, couldn’t keep up, proving she was indeed the first disciple of Little Master Uncle and quite extraordinary!

Pei Qian, suppressing her pain, hesitantly took out her beloved yellow-skinned small gourd and placed it on the table, gently pushing it toward Li Baoping. "Sister Baoping, I’m giving this to you as an apology."

Li Baoping was somewhat annoyed; why was Pei Qian being so polite? She glared and said, "Put it away!"

Pei Qian quickly obeyed and tucked the small gourd back into her sleeve.

———

After leaving Mao Xiaodong's study, the setting sun was fading, and dusk was approaching. Chen Ping'an decided to find Li Huai, who should be in class with the Confucians.

Outside the window of the study, Chen Ping'an spotted Li Huai, who was dozing off behind a book, with the book held high.

On either side of Li Huai sat two peers; one had a spirited face and was restless, glancing around. He noticed Chen Ping'an first and locked eyes with him.

The other child sat upright, engrossed in the lesson.

Liu Guan, seeing the young man in white smiling at him, knew he couldn’t be a Confucian from the academy, so he secretly made a fist-to-palm gesture of provocation.

The next moment, the teaching Confucian shouted, "Liu Guan!"

Liu Guan obediently stood up.

Li Huai, who had been dreaming sweetly, was startled awake. He set down his book and looked around in a daze.

The Confucian immediately called out, "And you, Li Huai! You two will copy 'The Encouragement of Learning' five times tonight! And no asking Ma Lian for help!"

The class had ended, and the old Confucian walked out with a stern face.

He nodded at Chen Ping'an, who had been paying attention.

Chen Ping'an bowed in return.

After leaving the lively and noisy classroom, Li Huai suddenly opened his eyes wide, wearing an expression of disbelief. "Chen Ping'an?!"

Chen Ping'an smiled and waved.

Li Huai broke into a big grin and suddenly called out, "Chen Ping'an, let me show you the invincible boxing techniques of Master Li!"

Li Huai then dashed toward Chen Ping'an with a clumsy six-step stance, only to be stopped by Chen Ping'an gently pressing down on his head.

After flailing for a while, Li Huai finally calmed down and, with red eyes, asked, "Chen Ping'an, why did you come so late? My sister left a long time ago! If you had met her, I could have played matchmaker for you two! You could have been flirting under the moonlight at our academy. Then I could call you brother-in-law!"

Chen Ping'an was at a loss whether to laugh or cry.

Li Huai grabbed Chen Ping'an's arm and turned to Liu Guan and Ma Lian, grinning, "This is Chen Ping'an, the one who sent me my book box and made me straw sandals! I told you he would definitely come back to the academy to see me. How about that? Do you believe it now?"

Liu Guan rolled his eyes.

So this was the Chen Ping'an that Li Huai had been talking about so much that they were tired of hearing about him.

Ma Lian quickly bowed to Chen Ping'an.

Li Huai laughed openly, then suddenly stopped and asked, "Have you seen Li Baoping?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "I met Little Baoping first when I came to the academy."

Li Huai nodded eagerly, "Let’s go find Li Baoping together! She needs to thank me for inviting you to the academy! Back when she was up on the mountain, she even wanted to come and hit me! Haha, can a little girl run faster than me? What a joke! I, Li Huai, am now a master of martial arts, quick enough to fly over rooftops..."

Chen Ping'an cleared his throat.

Li Huai suddenly noticed Liu Guan was smirking and Ma Lian was fidgeting. Slowly turning around, he saw Li Baoping standing behind him along with a small black girl. Upon seeing them, Li Huai felt a sense of fate, remembering the first time he met Chen Ping'an.

Li Baoping crossed her arms and sneered, "Li Huai, I said I’d give you a head start of a hundred steps. You can hide in a tree or on the roof or even in the latrine; it’s your choice."

Li Huai said with a hint of regret, "Li Baoping, since Chen Ping'an has really come to the academy, can we call it a draw?"

Li Baoping laughed, "A draw?"

After thinking for a moment, Li Huai said, "Alright, then I’ll concede this round."

Considering the sake of her Little Master Uncle, this time, Li Baoping chose not to hold it against Li Huai.

Seeing that Li Baoping didn’t seem to want to deal with him, Li Huai immediately puffed out his chest and grabbed Chen Ping'an's arm, bouncing with excitement. "Where are you staying now? Want to come to my place for a bit?"

Pei Qian’s eyes lit up; this Li Huai was a kindred spirit!

The group headed to the guest quarters where Chen Ping'an was staying.

Ma Lian actually wanted to follow Li Huai but was dragged away by Liu Guan for a meal.

Zhu Lian was still wandering and hadn’t returned.

Sister Shiro remained in her guest quarters, not wanting to see anyone.

In a Confucian academy,

Even if you were a genuine earth immortal or a ghostly being, who would dare to flaunt their stuff here?

Sister Shiro felt that every breath she took was a desecration of the academy, filled with guilt and reverence.

This was the realm of righteousness.

Chen Ping'an, Li Baoping, Pei Qian, and Li Huai.

They just so happened to form a table, sharing a meal prepared by the academy's kitchen.

Sitting opposite Chen Ping'an, Li Huai was the loudest and felt emboldened as long as Chen Ping'an was present; he didn’t even fear Li Baoping.

Li Huai asked, "Chen Ping'an, after we finish eating, do you want me to take you to find Lin Shouyi? That guy is hard to see these days, having a blast outside the academy, I envy him to death!"

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, "It’s currently the hour of the dog, a time when practicing qi cultivators take seriously, so it’s best not to disturb him. I’ll go find Lin Shouyi on my own later."

In the pursuit of the Great Dao, every detail counts.

There are some rules of cultivation that are universally applicable.

For example, there are four critical times in a day that should not be neglected. During the hour of the rat, the heavens are clear, most suitable for introspection and nurturing one's qi; during the hour of the tiger, it’s about circulating qi and benefiting the meridians; at noon, one refines qi into liquid with the fire of yang; and during the hour of the dog, one transforms liquid into spirit, storing every drop into the critical "mansions" of their innate acupoints, accumulating strength for the foundation of the Great Dao.

Besides the four critical times of a day, there are also specific rules for each month and year.

The essence of the Great Dao is simply about refining the acquired to mend the innate. The acquired practices resemble a water-polished mirror, gradually becoming clearer, ultimately reaching the legendary state of pure crystal.

The key is those subtle changes; once a practitioner crosses the threshold and begins the ascent, they will realize that even a day of laziness results in a day of loss. Therefore, practitioners cannot afford to slack off.

If one understands the intricacies, many derived rules that seem clouded will become clear. For instance, in the mundane world, emperors and rulers cannot cultivate beyond the mid-stage of the five realms. Or why cultivators gradually distance themselves from worldly affairs, unwilling to be entangled in the dust of the world, preferring to cultivate in places rich in spiritual energy, regarding their return to the mundane world as mere sharpening of their mindset, not related to substantial cultivation. Moreover, why cultivators who have entered the ascension realm are not allowed to leave their mountain tops or indiscriminately absorb the spiritual energy and fortunes from other places.

Cui Dongshan once jokingly said that the quest for immortality and longevity among cultivating practitioners leads to more and more who disregard rules as their cultivation rises; the less scrupulous behaviors become increasingly frequent, making the mundane world below sway as if a tenon-and-mortise joint was beginning to loosen.

As the head of the realm of righteousness, the Confucian saints have to labor hard to mend things.

It's said that when it comes to family education, the Daoist priests of the Qingming realm are the easiest to manage. As long as a great cultivator gets bold and does something disagreeable, that white jade capital's twelve floors will have an immortal dispatched with a decree from a certain "hall master" of the three teachings, soaring out to slap them down. However, some great cultivators who escaped a calamity might plead their case at a certain ascending platform, but historically only the disciple of the Dao Ancestor, the Grandmaster of the Lotus Crown, frequently listens to grievances and helps lighten punishments. There have even been records of him directly exempting punishments or turning the tables on the white jade capital’s immortals.

If it were up to the second disciple of the Dao Ancestor to make decisions,

No one would ever plead their case for grievances.

Because the second disciple would directly step in and kill them. Their lingering souls would most likely be dragged into his palms, into the most refined "thunder pool purgatory" in the world.

The world is vast.

Ordinary Confucians, throughout their lives, even if they love to travel, might not complete a single country’s journey. Even if they become cultivators, they wouldn’t dare claim they could traverse an entire continent. And those lucky enough to ascend to the peak of the five realms wouldn’t dare say they could traverse the entire world.

Li Baoping was rather quiet during the meal.

Pei Qian was too afraid to speak.

So it was all Li Huai who was chattering away. Li Baoping shot him several glares, explaining to him many matters of the academy, wondering how she would relay them to her Little Master Uncle.

Li Huai was oblivious, challenging Li Baoping recklessly, clearly inviting a future reckoning from her.

Chen Ping'an remained quiet, chewing slowly as he worked on serving dishes to the three children.

Suddenly, Li Huai asked, "Chen Ping'an, why did you change your outfit? You’re not wearing straw sandals anymore. Be careful; it’s easy to fall from extravagance to poverty..."

Before Li Huai could finish, he bent over, howling in agony.

Li Baoping and Pei Qian each kicked him under the table.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "I actually thought about wearing my old clothes and straw sandals when I came to the academy, but I was worried about embarrassing you. This outfit is because when traveling the jianghu, I need to be careful, plus wearing it helps with cultivation, so I’ve gotten used to this法袍 (Fa Pao) over time. My previous outfit wouldn’t feel uncomfortable either."

Li Huai grinned, "I barely recognized you when you were outside the study, Chen Ping'an! You’ve grown a lot taller, and you’re not as dark as before. I’m not used to it."

Chen Ping'an teased, "Well, Li Huai, you haven’t changed; you still get sleepy when reading?"

Li Huai sighed dramatically, "Chen Ping'an, you don’t know how hard it is for me to read now, it’s even more tiring than when we were on the road, especially during the Confucians’ lectures—I could hold my bladder for half my life!"

Li Baoping tapped her finger on the table, signaling Li Huai to mind his words.

Li Huai lamented, "Too many rules, even more than the Confucians!"

By now, they had almost finished eating, with hardly any food left on the table.

Chen Ping'an said, "I still need to visit Mao Xiaodong for a bit to discuss some matters. Afterward, I’ll go thank Lin Shouyi and Yu Lucheng. You guys can wander around; just remember not to break the academy's curfew."

Li Huai asked, "Chen Ping'an, how long are you planning to stay at the academy?"

Li Baoping unexpectedly smiled.

Pei Qian wore a fearful expression, trembling slightly.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "I won’t stay too long, but it won’t just be a few days either."

Li Huai said, "Oh, I see. When we return to Longquan County together, it’d be great. What’s this? Have you become wild from wandering outside for too long? Even if you don’t think much of Li Baoping, the academy has me, Li Huai! We’re good brothers who’ve been through thick and thin together! Who knows, I might even call you brother-in-law in the future! You know, back then, Ah Liang cried and wanted to be my brother-in-law, and I didn’t agree!"

Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, "Please don’t say this in front of Lin Shouyi and Dong Shuijing."

Li Huai sighed heavily, "Those two are impossible. One doesn’t know how to speak directly, and the other is as dense as a blockhead. I doubt my sister would like either of them. My mother likes Lin Shouyi more, while my father prefers Dong Shuijing. But in my family, I have the final say! Even my sister listens to me. Chen Ping'an, let’s make a deal: if you stay at the academy for a year with me, okay, even half a year will do, then you’ll be my brother-in-law! No need for any dowry!"

Chen Ping'an laughed and scolded, "Get lost!"

Li Huai slammed the table, "Chen Ping'an, speak nicely to your little brother-in-law! Don’t say I didn’t warn you!"

Li Baoping swiftly slapped Li Huai, causing him to shrink back, his bravado instantly evaporating.

Once Li Baoping and Pei Qian had taken the dishes to the kitchen outside the guest quarters, Li Huai approached Chen Ping'an, leaning over the table and whispering, "Chen Ping'an, my sister’s looking really pretty now, I’m not lying."

Chen Ping'an rubbed the little fellow’s head, "You don’t need to play the matchmaker; I already have someone I like."

Li Huai's expression dimmed.

Chen Ping'an gently said, "Not being your brother-in-law doesn’t mean I won’t be your friend."

Li Huai said weakly, "But I’m scared. What if you leave for three years this time and don’t come back? What if next time it’s five years? You won’t be the kind of friend who disappears like that! When I’m bullied in the academy, you won’t be around!"

Chen Ping'an found himself at a loss for words.

If his plans went as intended, it wouldn’t necessarily be that easy to reunite after three to five years.

He planned to pass through Longquan County and the Shuishui Kingdom before heading north, beyond the Great Li Dynasty at the northernmost point of Baoping Continent.

Li Huai sniffed, lifting his head and smiling, "Forget it! We’re all grown-ups now; being so sentimental isn’t like us! We’ll talk about tomorrow’s matters tomorrow!"

Chen Ping'an patted Li Huai's head, "Pei Qian seems a bit scared of Baoping. You can spend more time with her during this period."

Li Huai immediately laughed, "That little black lump? No problem! If Pei Qian is too embarrassed, I’m scared too! Who’s afraid of whom? That’s what a hero does!"

To be able to say such an embarrassing thing so confidently and grandly, it was likely only Li Huai who could do that.

Afterward, Chen Ping'an headed to Mao Xiaodong’s study again.

He began discussing the refining of his second innate object.

Mao Xiaodong had already received the secret letter from Cui Dongshan, and he was even more meticulous than Chen Ping'an himself.

Regarding the heavenly materials and earthly treasures needed to refine that golden literary talisman, he had already purchased most of them. A few were yet to be delivered to the academy, but he was certain he would collect them all before autumn.

Chen Ping'an mentioned that he might need to repay the money later.

Mao Xiaodong didn’t put on airs, saying they would calculate based on market price and aim to settle it within twenty years.

Since refining the golden literary talisman was a particularly special process, as one of the five innate objects, Mao Xiaodong was not only carefully examining the golden literary talisman that Chen Ping'an had taken from his belongings, but he had also researched the history of the Caiyi Kingdom and the local records of the city where the Chenghuang Pavilion was located. In the end, he determined that the literary minister who became a deity, Shen Wen, with his exquisite incense and righteous energy, would likely need to add the influence of the seal personally refined by the Grand Celestial Master, along with thunder law reinforcement, to give birth to this remarkable golden literary talisman.

So, Mao Xiaodong planned to take Chen Ping'an secretly to visit places like the Wen Temple in the Great Sui capital.

However, the final refining location would certainly be within the Mountain Cliff Academy, where he could oversee the atmosphere.

The two continued to polish the details.

Mao Xiaodong increasingly felt pleased.

Even when it came to the essence of cultivation that determined the level of achievement, Chen Ping'an remained unhurried and calm, with a mind as still as an ancient well, which made Mao Xiaodong very satisfied.

Many seemingly casual conversations, Chen Ping'an’s answers, and inquiries about some difficult questions from the books revealed a persistent determination, which didn’t astonish Mao Xiaodong but instead gave him a sense of reassurance.

This was more than enough!

Especially when Chen Ping'an glanced at the sky and said he would first check on Lin Shouyi and Yu Lucheng to express his gratitude before continuing their grand discussions on "important matters." Mao Xiaodong smiled and agreed to this.

After Chen Ping'an left with apologies,

The usually stern and serious elder sat alone in his study, unable to contain his emotions, tears flowing freely, but with a smile of contentment.

In Mao Xiaodong’s view, even ten of the exceptionally gifted Cui Qian couldn’t compare to a single Chen Ping'an!

———

Without Li Baoping around,

Pei Qian suddenly felt free and full of spirit.

Upon arriving at Li Huai’s study, it didn’t take long for not only Li Huai but even Liu Guan and Ma Lian to be left gaping, staring at her in shock.

Pei Qian, now equipped with a bamboo sword and sword sheath dangling from her waist, sat upright on the long bench, addressing the three gathered boys.

She was recounting her adventures in the jianghu.

Her opening statement was quite intimidating. "You should have noticed; I, Pei Qian, as my master’s disciple, am a very cold-blooded and iron-blooded jianghu person! The number of mountain and marsh spirits I’ve either killed or subdued is countless."

She imagined all the creatures she had defeated with her mad sword techniques, like the horsefly she had slain, the toad she had kicked off the mountain road, and the dirt dog she had pinned down—all of them were envisioned as future monsters.

With a hint of skepticism, Liu Guan offered tea.

Ma Lian quickly pulled out some pastries during Pei Qian's brief pause to drink.

Li Huai clutched his painted puppet, grinning foolishly, but in his heart, he thought that this dark girl was more boastful than himself and Ah Liang! He sensed he had met his match!

———

After leaving Mao Xiaodong’s residence, Chen Ping'an discovered Li Baoping waiting for him at the door, carrying that little bamboo box on her back.

He wasn’t surprised at all.

When Chen Ping'an first left his hometown, stepping into the world beyond Lihuzhu Cave, it was naturally to escort Li Baoping to the Great Sui for her studies.

But wasn’t it just as true that the little girl was accompanying her Little Master Uncle on his jianghu journey?

In those early days, when it was just the two of them supporting each other, the beautiful landscapes they traversed were especially dear.

Chen Ping'an didn’t rush to continue his journey; he squatted down and asked with a smile, "Baoping, has anyone bullied you at the academy these past few years?"

Li Baoping thought hard and shook her head, "Little Master Uncle, no one has."

Chen Ping'an scratched his head, feeling a bit disappointed.

Suddenly, some of Mao Xiaodong's words echoed in his mind.

Maintaining a neutral expression, after listening to her answer, Chen Ping'an stood up, holding Li Baoping’s hand, and began gazing at the night view of the Great Sui capital beyond the little eastern mountain of the academy.

As they began their descent,

"Little Master Uncle, I’ve already divided the books I copied into five portions and packed them into the little book box, giving them to five teaching Confucians. But those are just the portions for a month’s worth of skipped classes; I still have plenty more in my study. You don’t need to worry."

"Did the Confucians get angry?"

"They’re not angry; they’re used to it. They just want me to run a bit slower when moving the books."

"Then the Confucians are quite good."

"Yes, they are quite good, but their knowledge still doesn’t compare to Master Qi."

"Why is that?"

"Master Qi has the most knowledge. Little Master Uncle is the best. No reason."

"Ha, that makes sense!" 

(End of Chapter)### Chapter 404: A Visit

Chen Ping'an first stopped by the villa solely occupied by Cui Dongshan. At the entrance, Li Baoping asked if Pei Qian could stay with her that night. Chen Ping'an replied that as long as Pei Qian agreed, that was fine.

Li Baoping then inquired if she could give or lend Pei Qian the narrow knife, the auspicious charm, and the silver gourd, to make her more impressive while wandering the martial world.

Chen Ping'an chuckled and said that there was no need to send Pei Qian such expensive gifts just yet. He would prepare everything she needed for her travels in the future as her master. Besides, for her first trip, it was better not to be too eye-catching; a small donkey as a mount would suffice, and the knife and charm were quite similar in appearance—he called it "Stopping Snow," while the sword was a "Devoted Heart"; neither was too shabby.

Li Baoping still felt a bit regretful.

After waving goodbye to her little martial aunt, she hurried off with her small green bamboo box.

Before Chen Ping'an could knock, Xie Xie gently opened the courtyard door.

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "Is this a bad time?"

Xie Xie shook her head and stepped aside.

In Chen Ping'an's eyes, his impression of her was far better than that of Lu. Moreover, as the "young master's" servant, Xie Xie didn't dare to be negligent; otherwise, she would be the one to suffer in the end.

She openly scrutinized Chen Ping'an for a moment and remarked, "I've only heard that girls change a lot as they grow up; how have you changed so much?"

As Chen Ping'an entered the courtyard, Xie Xie hesitated for a moment, then closed the door. With a hint of self-mockery, she thought that with her current unappealing appearance, even if Chen Ping'an had lost his mind, he wouldn’t find her attractive.

After all, she knew perfectly well what kind of person Chen Ping'an was. She never thought they were on the same path, nor did she feel any instant affection; she merely didn’t dislike him, and that was all.

It was like how people viewed calligraphy—whether one was fond of the fluidity of cursive script or preferred the rigidity of standard script was merely a matter of personal taste, with no superior or inferior distinction.

Compared to her indifference toward Lu, Xie Xie was much more courteous and tolerant toward Chen Ping'an. She pointed to the green bamboo corridor outside the main house, saying, "You don't need to take off your shoes; this is the celestial green bamboo from the Qingxiao Crossing of the Great Sui, warm in winter and cool in summer. It’s suitable for cultivators to meditate. Before you leave, let me send a message to Lin Shouyi; he can come here to practice thunder techniques. But I think Lin Shouyi probably won’t agree, so I didn’t bother."

Chen Ping'an took off the boots that Pei Qian had secretly purchased for him in Huli Town.

He sat cross-legged on the truly comfortable bamboo floor, flipped his wrist, and took out a pot of well water wine he had bought from the Bee Tail Ferry, asking, "Want a drink? It's just a local brew."

Xie Xie, sitting slanted on the steps not far away, nodded.

Chen Ping'an gently tossed the wine pot over.

Xie Xie caught it, opened it, and sniffed, "Not bad, indeed. It’s worthy of being drawn from such a fine vessel."

She didn’t rush to drink, instead smiling and asking, "That robe you’re wearing, is it a magic robe? I can sense its aura only because I’m in this courtyard."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "This robe is called Golden Liquor. I found it on my way to the Upside-Down Mountain, in a place called Jiao Long Gou."

Xie Xie turned her head to look toward the courtyard gate, her eyes complex as she murmured, "You really have good luck."

Chen Ping'an replied with an "Mm," took a sip of the wine, and set the sword-raising gourd aside.

Xie Xie laughed, "You’ve really acquired a taste for wine. This trip into the martial world hasn’t been in vain."

Chen Ping'an pretended not to hear and felt the bamboo floor; the spiritual energy flowed like a gentle stream. Although it couldn’t compare to the top-notch celestial residences or caves, it was already far more abundant than the best inns of the secular dynasty.

The world was quiet.

Xie Xie spoke to herself, "Stars dot the four corners, with a river of silver water in the middle. Is it cooling?"

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "What poet from the Lu dynasty wrote that?"

Xie Xie slowly shook her head, "A long time ago, on a night much like this, my master casually recited a line; it was a fragment without beginning or end. She referred to it as 'Poetic Remnants.' It’s just a trivial thing, no different from calligraphy or chess, not worth mentioning."

Chen Ping'an said, "At the Lingzhi Zhai on the Upside-Down Mountain, I had prepared gifts for both you and Lin Shouyi. For your gift, I mistakenly thought it was just an irreparable broken Dew Armor, so I bought it at a low price. Later, I realized it was one of the eight ancestral pieces of the Divine Person's Dew Armor, and I even had a friend repair it. After meeting Cui Dongshan in the Qingluan Kingdom, I mentioned this to him. He said not to give you such an expensive item since our friendship isn’t that deep yet, and you might misunderstand my intentions. I thought that made sense, so I figured I’d save it for later when we are truly friends. So today, I’ll give you this instead."

Xie Xie turned her head and caught a beautifully carved piece of sheep-fat jade, which was the white cow carrying the Lingzhi.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "It’s just a small token from the Lingzhi Zhai; don’t think too much of it."

Xie Xie chuckled, "Are you implying that as long as I become friends with you, Chen Ping'an, I can obtain a priceless weapon?"

Chen Ping'an only smiled and remained silent.

Xie Xie held the jade piece, saying to herself, "You’re not that kind of person."

Chen Ping'an raised the sword-raising gourd, suppressing a laugh, "Thanks."

Xie Xie glanced at Chen Ping'an, "Oh, you’ve been away for a few years and learned to be slick-tongued? Truly, a parting of three days deserves new appraisal."

Chen Ping'an tucked the gourd back at his waist, hands in his sleeves, and sighed, "That time when Li Huai was bullied by outsiders, you, Lin Shouyi, and Lu showed great loyalty. When I heard about it, I was genuinely pleased. So I mentioned the Dew Armor from Xiyue not to brag, but because I really hope one day I can become friends with you. I have my own selfish motives; even if we don’t become friends, I want you to be good friends with Xiao Baoping and Li Huai, so you can look out for them in the academy."

There was one more reason Chen Ping'an couldn’t voice.

Regardless of how twisted things were, he was now, in name, Cui Dongshan's teacher and had some responsibility over her.

Cui Dongshan taking Xie Xie as a close servant was, in a way, a disservice to this former genius of the Lu dynasty.

But the world was complicated, and many seemingly well-meaning intentions might lead to bad outcomes.

Some scars of others should not be disturbed; coexistence was the best policy.

Once exposed, blood would flow.

Chen Ping'an sat at the bottom of the steps, still wearing the boots.

Xie Xie softly said, "I won’t see you off."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "No need."

After Chen Ping'an left, Xie Xie unexpectedly covered her mouth and laughed.

For some reason, she felt that he resembled a cat that had snuck back home at midnight, trying to avoid an angry tigress.

Of course, that was just a rather inexplicable thought of hers.

A woman’s heart is as deep as the ocean.

It only indicated that Xie Xie was in a good mood at that moment.

She raised her hand, holding high the jade piece of the white cow carrying the Lingzhi.

It looked quite nice.

Chen Ping'an departed from this top-notch feng shui spot of the academy and arrived at Lu's solitary dwelling. Although the lights in the room had already been extinguished, he knocked on the door without hesitation.

Lu quickly came to open the door, wearing his boots, and smiled, "What a rare visitor!"

He turned first to light a lamp, while Chen Ping'an helped close the door, and the two sat opposite each other.

In Lu's room, aside from the items prepared for students by the academy long ago, it was essentially empty.

This was Lu.

It was as if he had no burdens on his mind.

As a prince of a great dynasty, after his kingdom fell, he remained indifferent to the world, even facing one of the culprits, Cui Dongshan, without the deep-seated hatred that Xie Xie harbored.

In this regard, Lu and the martial madman Zhu Lian from a wealthy family were somewhat similar.

During their journey to the Great Sui Academy, Chen Ping'an often shared the night watch with Lu, taking turns—one for the first half, the other for the second. If the one on the first half wasn’t sleepy, they would sit by the campfire, but not much conversation flowed. Chen Ping'an often practiced his stances or six-step movements, while if he stood still, Lu would daydream, and if he moved, Lu would watch for a while.

Lu didn’t drink.

Chen Ping'an also didn’t drink.

He presented the volume of the divine book "Shan Hai Zhi," which he had also bought from the Upside-Down Mountain.

Lu naturally thanked him, saying he was too poor to return the favor with a gift, so he could only see Chen Ping'an off at the door of the dwelling.

After Chen Ping'an left, Lu gently closed the door.

He continued to "walk" in the pitch-black room with his eyes closed, repeatedly loosening and clenching his fists.

While Lu practiced, Xie Xie was also diligently cultivating in the bamboo corridor.

When Lin Shouyi saw Chen Ping'an, he wasn’t surprised.

In fact, he already knew about Chen Ping'an’s arrival but hesitated before ultimately not going to the guesthouse to find him.

Chen Ping'an had sent Lin Shouyi a copy of the incomplete thunder technique book from the Lingzhi Zhai, which came with annotations, stating, "This is a unique piece; if it weren’t for the missing dozens of pages, it would be priceless."

Lin Shouyi accepted it without rejection.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Xie Xie asked me to pass a message to you: if you don’t mind, please go over to her place for your daily practice."

Lin Shouyi pondered for a moment and nodded, "Sure, I’ll go whenever I have free time during the day."

Chen Ping'an didn’t linger, not even sitting for half a stick of incense before preparing to leave. Before opening the door, Lin Shouyi was clearly practicing a breathing technique on a cushion.

Suddenly, Lin Shouyi laughed and asked, "Chen Ping'an, do you know why I’m willing to accept such a valuable gift?"

Chen Ping'an stopped and turned to ask, "What do you mean?"

Lin Shouyi, who never kept guests in the dwelling, astonishingly walked over to the table and poured two cups of tea, prompting Chen Ping'an to return and sit.

Now a dashing young man, Lin Shouyi paused for a moment and said, "I know that I will definitely repay you with something even more valuable in the future."

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile.

He hadn’t changed; this fellow still had that aloof demeanor.

Lin Shouyi glanced at the bamboo box, a smirk creeping onto his lips, "Moreover, I’m quite grateful to you for one thing. Take a guess."

Given his actions, what was there to guess? Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, "Isn’t it just that I gave you a bamboo box? Although it was made from the bamboo I transplanted from Qingshen Mountain, it’s not even close to the value of the thunder technique book."

Lin Shouyi shook his head with a smile, "Guess again."

Chen Ping'an recalled their travels and tentatively asked, "Is it about the inn?"

Lin Shouyi shook his head again, bursting into hearty laughter as he got up to usher him out, jokingly saying, "Don’t think you can waste my time just because you gave me a gift."

Chen Ping'an left the dwelling in a daze.

After meeting with the three, he didn’t return the same way.

Finishing his deliveries an hour earlier than expected, Chen Ping'an took a slightly longer route, walking through the quiet areas of the cliff-side academy.

Just as he passed by the guesthouse, he spotted Li Huai sneaking over.

Upon seeing Chen Ping'an, Li Huai quickened his pace, saying urgently, "Chen Ping'an, I came to ask you a question; otherwise, I won’t be able to sleep."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "About Pei Qian? Go ahead."

Li Huai whispered, "At first, I thought Pei Qian was just bragging, but the more I hear, the more I think she’s incredible. Chen Ping'an, tell me honestly, is Pei Qian really a princess who has fallen into the common world?"

Chen Ping'an could easily imagine Pei Qian wearing a stern expression while secretly enjoying the fun of telling such a lie, probably even laughing at how gullible Li Huai and the others were.

Li Huai, Liu Guan, and Ma Lian—those three kids—were hardly immune to Pei Qian's tall tales, so it was no surprise they’d fall for it.

However, Chen Ping'an had no intention of exposing Pei Qian’s fibs; he wouldn’t ruin the innocent fun between the kids.

He patted Li Huai on the shoulder and said, "Figure it out yourself."

Li Huai nodded vigorously, suddenly enlightened, "I see now!"

Chen Ping'an asked with a smile, "What did you figure out?"

Li Huai crossed his arms, one hand rubbing his chin, "No wonder this little black coal looked so disdainful when she saw my painted puppet. I need to compete with her tomorrow and show off my family's background! Let’s see who has more treasures! What’s so great about a princess? Isn’t she just a small black coal kid? Who’s she scaring with her bamboo sword? By the way, Chen Ping'an, what does the princess like to eat?"

Chen Ping'an pressed down on Li Huai's head and gently twisted it toward his own dwelling, "Hurry back and sleep."

Having gotten his questions answered, Li Huai turned and ran back to his own dormitory.

Not long after, an angry shout came from afar.

Without needing to think, it was clear that Li Huai had been caught by the patrolling teacher.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to intervene for Li Huai, he soon saw Li Huai swaggering back, accompanied by Zhu Lian.

It turned out Zhu Lian had already come up with an excuse, saying that Li Huai was a distant relative who didn’t know the way back to the guesthouse at night and needed Li Huai’s help.

Li Huai gave Chen Ping'an a thumbs-up, "Brother Zhu is really righteous! Chen Ping'an, you’re fortunate to have such a steward."

Then Li Huai turned to Zhu Lian, smiling, "Brother Zhu, if Chen Ping'an treats you poorly in the future, come find me, Li Huai, and I’ll help you seek justice."

Zhu Lian looked at him, noticing that this Li Huai was quite boisterous and didn’t look like a studious type.

Zheng Dafu, Li Er, Li Baozhen, Li Baoping.

It was rare to encounter a non-anomalous individual from the Li Zhu Dongtian.

Zhu Lian felt he needed to cherish this moment, and suddenly, Li Huai seemed much more likable to him, appearing increasingly amiable.

Wait a minute, this Li Huai looks quite similar to that ten-peak martial artist who visited the Old Dragon City, and both Li Er and Li Huai share the surname Li—could they be related?

Only as a pure martial artist could Zhu Lian fully understand the terror of a master at the peak of ten realms.

No matter how proud Zhu Lian was of his martial talent, he only dared to say that if he were born and raised in the Haoran world, under the same conditions, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to reach the peak of the ninth realm in his lifetime; the tenth realm was uncertain.

Zhu Lian turned to Chen Ping'an, his eyes filled with inquiry.

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile.

Zhu Lian, half furious, lightly kicked Li Huai in the rear, "What are you doing wandering around like a ghost in the middle of the night? Hurry up and scram."

Li Huai jumped in shock, running away while pointing at Zhu Lian from a distance, "You helped me once and kicked me once; our grudges are settled. If we cross paths again at the academy tomorrow, whoever runs first is the big shot!"

Zhu Lian made a motion to kick again.

Li Huai quickly vanished from sight.

At Li Baoping's dormitory, she and Pei Qian sat at the same table, copying books across from each other.

One wrote as fast as lightning.

The other crawled like a turtle.

After every page Li Baoping finished copying, she would exclaim "Done!" and lay down her brush, twisting her wrist to glance over at Pei Qian.

Pei Qian remained silent, drenched in sweat.

In the city of Liu Prefecture, adjacent to the capital of the Great Sui, the Cai family residence, which had just moved in not long ago, received a "distinguished guest of high standing."

That was none other than Cui Dongshan, who had gained a bright nickname of "Cai Family Ancestor" by utilizing countless magical treasures from the smaller vessels within the Cliff Academy.

In the dead of night, the white-clad youth banged on the Cai family’s door, making a thunderous noise, shouting, "Little Cai, little Cai, hurry up and open the door!"

The handsome youth, with a red birthmark on his forehead, was followed by a sturdy little man and a yellow cow.

The once-great elder of the Great Sui who had stationed near the Cliff Academy, with a grim expression, emerged from his secret chamber. He soared into the courtyard and landed on the street outside his front door, "Cui, what are you doing here?!"

Years ago, in the skies above what the citizens of the Great Sui’s capital habitually referred to as "Little Dongshan," Cui Dongshan had a thrilling battle with Cai Jing Shen.

Cui Dongshan gained fame from that battle, as if he had given the citizens of the capital a free fireworks show. Who could forget how many people that night gazed up at the Donghua Mountain from the academy with delight?

With a元婴地仙 (Yuan Ying Earth Immortal) ancestor serving as a stabilizing force, the once-mighty Cai family soon vacated the capital, leaving only a family member serving as an official to guard their grand residence.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, "Ah, Jing Shen, how polite! You even came out to greet me? Come on, let’s hurry to our house to sit. It’s late coming into the city, and with the night restrictions, I’m starving. Hurry and have someone prepare a midnight snack for us to chat about."

Cai Jing Shen’s face darkened. "You’re not welcome here."

Cui Dongshan suddenly pointed at Cai Jing Shen, hopping in anger, "Ungrateful grandchild! Are you giving me the cold shoulder? Come on, let’s have another round! If you can withstand fifty of my magical treasures this time, I’ll call you my ancestor. If not, you’ll have to ride a horse through the streets tomorrow, shouting that you’re my Cui Dongshan’s good grandson a thousand times!"

Cai Jing Shen gritted his teeth, saying, "A gentleman can be killed but not insulted. You either kill me tonight or don’t think about stepping half a foot into my Cai family!"

Cui Dongshan flickered out of sight, using a technique to compress space. It seemed ordinary but was far from the standard Daoist methods. He then returned to his original spot, saying, "So, what’s it going to be? Are you going to commit suicide, you unfilial grandson? I can’t refuse to acknowledge you as your ancestor, so I can lend you some sharp magical treasures. Otherwise, you’ll say you had no proper weapons to end your life..."

He rambled on endlessly.

The stout elder was so furious that his inner energy surged wildly, his aura rising.

Cui Dongshan suddenly stopped laughing, squinting his eyes, and said ominously, "You little brat, you probably think that the battle at Donghua Mountain was won due to your ancestor having the advantage of time and place, right?"

Cai Jing Shen’s heart trembled. Just as a deadly confrontation loomed, he horrifiedly discovered that Cui Dongshan’s pupils had turned vertical and emitted a piercing golden light.

It felt as if he was being targeted by an ancient dragon stirring up a storm.

Cai Jing Shen felt a chill run down his spine.

Quickly, he suppressed his aura, extending a hand and solemnly saying, "Please!"

The old doorman, peeking through the crack in the door, went from sleepily rubbing his eyes to feeling cold sweat, ultimately looking as if he had seen a ghost, trembling as he opened the door.

Cui Dongshan swaggered past the threshold.

Cai Jing Shen followed closely behind.

Wei Xian and the yellow cow also entered the Cai family residence in succession.

Once the doorman shut the door, he lamented inwardly. Just as he had barely escaped this plague, his ancestor had shown off his skills here, helping the district magistrate deal with a cunning river demon, re-establishing the Cai family’s authority. But now, just a few days of peace had gone by, and yet trouble was already knocking at the door again. Truly, good men don’t come, and those who come aren’t good. All he could hope for was peace and prosperity, without any more disturbances.

Cui Dongshan mumbled about needing a midnight snack, and Cai Jing Shen bore with it, ordering the pure martial artist Wei to bring a jar of the finest wine from the state city. He endured this, and even that small Dragon Gate realm yellow cow demon was to be given a separate courtyard in the Cai family—Cai Jing Shen couldn’t endure this either... but he did.

Cai Jing Shen dismissed two curious maids from the household, leaving no one else present, before asking, "What exactly do you want? Be straightforward!"

Cui Dongshan propped one foot on a chair, holding a wine jug in one hand and eating with the other, wolfing down the food while mumbling, "You’ve been the local tyrant in the Great Sui capital for over a hundred years. Why don’t you tell me about those fools behind the assassination plot currently in motion? Of course, I know about the general of the cavalry, Tang Zhuangshan, the right minister of war, Tao Jiu, and General Long Niu, Miao Ren, but we both know those guys aren’t the true masterminds scheming behind the scenes. Just name a few you’re aware of, and let’s hear it."

Cai Jing Shen’s eyelids twitched slightly.

Cui Dongshan tossed aside a particularly delicious secret sauce duck leg, licking his fingers as he glanced sideways at Cai Jing Shen, smiling, "I’ll allow you to name one conspirator related to this matter, and then you can name another completely unrelated name. It could be an old rival from the mountains or a relative from the Gao clan you just happen to dislike."

Cui Dongshan burped, "This offer stands until I finish this meal. Once I’m done, your Cai family won’t have this chance anymore. You might not realize it yet, but the Gao clan descendant you left in the capital, hmm, the one working at the Imperial Academy, is also one of the Cai family’s seeds. Being a scholar, they don’t want to watch the Great Sui collapse while bowing to the barbarians of the Great Li. It’s understandable, the Gao family has nurtured scholars for hundreds of years, even willing to die for their country. I admire that, but understanding and admiration can’t fill your stomach. So, Cai Jing Shen, you decide."

Cui Dongshan continued to eat heartily.

Cai Jing Shen asked in a deep voice, "I need to know something first: is Cai Feng truly involved?"

Cui Dongshan sneered, "Do you need me to waste my breath on Cai Feng’s literary integrity and lofty aspirations? You really take me for your Cai family’s ancestor, don’t you?"

Cai Jing Shen’s face was filled with anguish.

Despite being a元婴地仙 (Yuan Ying Earth Immortal) who could look down on lords and nobles, Cai Jing Shen was still bound by family ties. The deceased ancestors could only rely on unfathomable merits in the afterlife, and those who practiced the way naturally had to strike a balance, supporting promising descendants while not hindering their own cultivation. As for those descendants, whether they pursued literary or martial paths, or even cultivation, it was their duty to uphold the family name and bring honor to their ancestors.

In the past century, the Cai family had only produced one mediocre qi practitioner. Even with Cai Jing Shen’s guidance and abundant resources, they still remained at the cave realm, with little prospect for advancement.

Thus, Cai Jing Shen placed much hope on Cai Feng, even preparing for Cai Feng’s potential rise in the government and the honors that would follow, ultimately ascending to the position of city god after a century of recognition.

The winds of fortune shift, and opportunities are unpredictable; for ordinary people, missing a chance can mean a lifetime without it. However, qi practitioners are different: as long as they live long enough, fortune will eventually flow their way, allowing them to use celestial secret arts to preserve their family’s fortune, akin to how ordinary people accumulate wealth.

What Cai Jing Shen never anticipated was that Cai Feng would throw away a promising future and drag him and the entire family into such a conspiracy.

Cui Dongshan gently set down his chopsticks.

*(End of Chapter)***Chapter 405: Yearning of the Heart**

Cui Dongshan casually set down his chopsticks, lowered his head to align them neatly, and then raised his head with a smile. "It seems you're quite certain I won't go on a killing spree here?"

He clapped his hands and laughed, slowly rising from his seat. "You guessed right. I won't indulge my whims and commit indiscriminate slaughter, after all, I still have to return to the Cliffside Academy. Well then, descendants have their own fortunes. As the ancestor, I can only assist you up to this point."

Cai Jingshen gestured for Cui Dongshan to sit back down and asked, "How can you prove that your words hold weight, both in the Great Sui's court and in the Great Li's halls?"

Cui Dongshan lazily leaned back in his chair, fiddling with his hair bun. "It's hard to prove."

Cai Jingshen had no choice but to take a step back. After a moment's hesitation, he said in a deep voice, "Then how will you extract Cai Feng without leaving any future repercussions? It can't affect his future career. I must remind you, he cannot turn against us at the last moment, selling out friends for personal gain; that would obstruct his posthumous enshrinement as a deity. For the next century, Cai Feng's fate will be closely tied to the Sui dynasty's fortunes, culture, and geomancy. If he engages in such despicable acts, he may enjoy honor in life, but in death, he will surely be rejected by Sui's incense offerings."

Cui Dongshan smiled. "Rest assured, I have my methods. I guarantee Cai Feng will reach the position of Minister of the Six Ministries during his lifetime, except for the Ministry of Rites, which is too important. I'm not the Emperor of Great Li. As for after his death, within a century, he will become the City God of a large province, excluding the territory of the Gao family's Longxing in Geyang. How does that sound?"

Cai Jingshen tentatively asked, "And what about the Cai family's choices and reputation?"

Cui Dongshan laughed. "I will let you and the Cai family collaborate on a couple of schemes that will win you universal praise, and future historians will surely speak well of you."

Cai Jingshen hesitated, wanting to say something but holding back.

Cui Dongshan scoffed. "Are we to sign a water pact like some earth immortals? Cai Jingshen, I advise you not to overreach."

Cai Jingshen thought of those golden eyes, shivering with fear. Although he felt repressed by the Cai family, this little annoyance was nothing compared to the unbearable consequences of dragging the entire family into an abyss because of Cai Feng alone, which might even jeopardize his own cultivation as their ancestor. Thus, this bit of frustration was easy to endure.

Having become temporary allies, Cai Jingshen wanted to express some sincerity. "Back when Mr. Cui was in the academy, he was nearly assassinated with golden threads. He escaped using a death replacement charm. Don’t you want to know who was behind it? Or do you think it was just a group of people?"

Cui Dongshan shot a sidelong glance at Cai Jingshen.

Cai Jingshen felt uneasy under that gaze, unsure where he had gone wrong.

Cui Dongshan stood up and picked up a sealed jar of aged wine from the table. "Back then, I was so bored in the academy I almost contemplated hanging myself at the mountaintop. It was not easy waiting for something interesting to happen. Do you know what I did afterward? I waited a long time, and when they didn’t continue their ambush, I had no choice but to go to the Qingxiao Ferry myself to stretch my neck. And what happened? No one dared to act. So, I had to haul a few carts of green bamboo from Qingxiao Ferry back to the academy to lay the floor. I paid whatever price it was worth. Why? I was grateful to them for relieving my boredom. I devised so many contingencies for the second assassination. Even though I never had the chance to implement them, that process of brainstorming was a great way to pass the time."

Cui Dongshan walked around the table and patted Cai Jingshen on the shoulder. "Little Cai, you're still too young. You don't understand my temperament. After spending more time together, you'll realize you’ve recognized a good ancestor. If you have the time, go visit your family's ancestral grave. I guarantee there will be smoke rising. If any of the Cai ancestors come to you in a dream, weeping and thanking me, just tell them there’s no need to thank me. Generosity has always been the foundation of my character."

Cai Jingshen maintained a stern expression, pretending not to hear.

The yellow cow demon, resembling a bull, had already gone to the "Bull Pen" to rest.

Wei Xian remained seated at the table with Cui Dongshan and Cai Jingshen, silent, merely drinking.

After finishing his drink, Wei Xian followed Cui Dongshan back to their quarters.

Once they were seated, Cui Dongshan used his golden flying sword to create a lightning barrier, blocking Cai Jingshen’s prying eyes.

He kicked off his boots, sat cross-legged in his chair, and smiled at Wei Xian. "Come help me finalize this with a few words."

Wei Xian slowly spoke. "A bird flying high dies from exquisite food. A fish in a deep spring dies from sweet bait."

In Wei Xian's view, people like Cai Jingshen were indecisive and not worth mentioning.

In the grand scheme of things, amidst the roaring tide, even a Nascent Soul earth immortal was no more than a mantis trying to stop a chariot.

Before entering the provincial city, Cui Dongshan had shown Wei Xian numerous intelligence reports regarding the internal affairs of the Great Sui. Compared to the secrets hidden by the Gao family and the old patron of the Cai family, Cai Feng's conspiracy was merely a small matter.

The Gao family of the Great Sui had once teamed up with the Lu dynasty to suppress the rising Great Li, which had the national teacher Cui Chan and the Cliffside Academy for decades.

But it wasn't just as simple as the emperor of the Great Sui being far-sighted.

Back then, the Great Li also had a faction of Mohists and the talented Lu family of Yin-Yang scholars, assisting in the construction of that replica of the white jade capital. The Great Sui and the Lu dynasty had their share of prominent figures from various schools of thought hiding in the background, manipulating events.

Cai Jingshen was a relatively important piece on the board, buried deep within the game.

Despite Cai Jingshen's timid demeanor tonight, the overall situation was firmly in Cui Dongshan's grasp. In fact, even his earlier decision to "resign in anger" and move his family away from the capital likely stemmed from the guidance of a higher power.

Now that the Great Sui and Great Li had formed a powerful alliance, one side gathered at Donghua Mountain, where the Cliffside Academy was located, and the other at the newly established Northern Cloud Mountain for the grand sacrificial rites. It appeared to be a win-win situation; the Great Sui wouldn’t have to confront the Great Li's cavalry directly, winning a great opportunity for over a hundred years of recuperation, albeit at the cost of ceding the Huangting Kingdom that served as a buffer. Meanwhile, the Great Li could preserve its strength and charge southward, like a hot knife through butter, reaching the borders of the Zhu Ying dynasty.

However, behind this facade of peace, the Song family of the Great Li and the Gao family of the Great Sui naturally had their own thoughts.

Especially after the death of Emperor Song Zhengchun of the Great Li, even though the core of the Great Li kept its secrets, one could believe that the Great Sui might have already caught wind of it, which was likely why they were starting to stir.

Today, although the Great Li's cavalry seemed unstoppable, having taken half of Baopingzhou, it was still precarious. Once both the Great Li and Great Sui faced internal turmoil, and if the Guanhu Academy and the Zhu Ying dynasty suddenly exerted force, then the seemingly favorable situation for the Great Li would be immediately overturned, and the entire northern territory trampled under the hooves of the Great Li's cavalry would become a feast for the behind-the-scenes bigwigs.

Cui Dongshan's journey, in his frankness with Wei Xian, had no specific goal; it all depended on how Cai Jingshen would react, whether it was to entice, suppress, or serve as bait.

Wei Xian dared not say that Cui Dongshan could definitely outmaneuver those top figures behind the scenes.

But a mere Cai Jingshen was certainly not a challenge, easily toyed with by Cui Dongshan.

Hence, Wei Xian felt compelled to use the analogy of a bird or fish being lured by bait.

Cui Dongshan shook his head and extended his fingers, writing the same sixteen characters in the air.

"Humble in posture, it will summon blows. The fox shrinks its body, it will be taken."

Wei Xian frowned. "Does the Great Sui truly intend to tear up the alliance, staking everything on a gamble, perhaps to replace the Great Li?"

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, pointing at himself.

Wei Xian was taken aback and clasped his hands, "The national teacher's foresight is something beyond ordinary comprehension."

Cui Dongshan feigned annoyance. "From now on, just call me Mr. Cui. Every time you address me as the national teacher, it feels like you're taking advantage of me, the founding emperor of the Southern Garden Kingdom."

Wei Xian sighed. "The little Southern Garden is merely a few states of the Great Li. It once had a fallen immortal who left behind a few words, which is why I ordered the scholars of the Southern Garden to seek hidden truths in the mountains and visit immortals at sea. But unless I truly step into the world of the Haoran, I still cannot imagine how vast the true world is."

Cui Dongshan smiled. "There is a remarkable scholar in the Central Land who once lamented about the disparity between the vast sea and the tiny land. If you ever have the chance, I’ll take you to meet him. At that time, your musings about being a frog at the bottom of a well will be quite timely."

Cui Dongshan held onto the arms of his chair, swaying it back and forth, making it seem as if he were riding a horse, appearing extremely comical.

However, Wei Xian had grown accustomed to such antics after spending so much time with Cui Dongshan, and in this regard, he and Yu Lu adapted far quicker than merely expressing gratitude.

This was perhaps the mindset of emperors and heirs.

Cui Dongshan slowly said, "I've already shared the answer with you. The Great Sui's shadowy figures and the Great Li are both competing for future moves. The life or death of a pawn like Cai Feng, and whether Cai Jingshen and others will surrender, won't stir up a storm. So, my reasons for lingering in the provincial city and not heading to the capital academy aren't as complicated as you think. My master cares most about the Little Treasure Bottle. Mao Xiaodong can’t keep a secret; he will definitely inform him about the Great Sui's disgraceful plot. If I rush in now, I’ll surely attract ire and be accused of neglecting my duties."

"If I mention the state affairs, that would be even less welcome. I might not even be able to retain my position as the master. But something must be done. I can't just tell my master not to worry; the children of the Treasure Bottle, Li Huai, will surely be fine. My master's knowledge is becoming increasingly comprehensive, from the initial sequence of intentions to the final purpose—good or bad—as well as the choices along the way. It all has a rough outline. My more cold-blooded, mercantile methods of accomplishment are quite taxing to deal with."

"So, it’s better for me to hide here, make amends, bring out practical results, help sever some connections, and then go back to the academy to accept punishment. At worst, I’ll just receive a beating, which is far better than leaving my master with a knot in his heart. If I fail to convince him that I have ill intentions, even a deity would be hard-pressed to save me. Even if the old scholar comes to plead for me, it might not be effective."

Wei Xian pondered for a moment before he was about to speak.

Cui Dongshan had already moved himself and the chair to the window, turning his back to Wei Xian and waving his hand. "For now, you, Wei Xian, have no right to comment on the entanglements between my master and me, so just observe more and speak less."

Cui Dongshan murmured, "The county magistrate Wu Yuan of Longquan, Wei Li of Huangting Kingdom, Liu Qingfeng of the Qingluan Kingdom, General Wei Liang, and you, Wei Xian, are all fine talents we have chosen. Among them, you and Wei Liang have the highest starting points, but whether you excel in the future relies on your own abilities. As for Wei Liang, he’s a lone cloud and wild crane, not truly a piece on the board, belonging to the realm of the Great Path. However, Wu Yuan and Liu Qingfeng are his careful cultivations, while you and Wei Li are my selections. In the future, the four of you will compete for us."

This was somewhat veiled and confusing, but Wei Xian silently committed it to memory.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan slapped the armrest of his chair. "That fool Shi Rou probably still doesn’t realize that the words folded within the brocade bag are my heartfelt sentiments, sincere and earnest, each word filled with blood and tears, the most precious wisdom of someone who has been through it all. Next time I see her in the academy, if she hasn’t made any progress, just wait and see how I deal with her! Hmph, Du Mao, that immortal's shed, doesn’t need to eat, drink, or sleep, so she can endure the disgust. But I’ll make her eat, drink, and bathe all at once! I’ll let her know what a real man is!"

Wei Xian took his leave.

Cui Dongshan waved his sleeve, dispelling the golden lightning barrier.

Wei Xian genuinely admired and respected this person.

He admired how the Great Li achieved its current state, transforming from a small vassal state under the Lu dynasty into its present glory in less than a century, relying on the principle of creating something out of nothing.

But that alone wasn’t enough for Wei Xian to feel awe toward the national teacher Cui Chan. This man, while conquering the world, was also straining every nerve to figure out how to secure his kingdom.

Wei Xian believed that this was true chess playing.

After Wei Xian left, Cui Dongshan flicked his wrist, bringing the jar of wine to his hand and taking small sips.

Throughout his tumultuous journey, he had seen too many people and events, read countless books, and observed innumerable landscapes.

In that thrilling battle of the three and four factions from years ago, there was an inconspicuous civil servant who had said something that probably no one took to heart but had deeply moved Cui Chan, remaining etched in his memory ever since.

"Heaven and earth bestow life; death is inevitable. The grass and trees change with the seasons; glory must lead to withering—this is the way of heaven! You practitioners of Qi, unconcerned with the law, who treat common folk as ants, how are you different from those mountain gods of the demon tribes?!"

Cui Dongshan pinched the wine jar with his fingers, slouched against the chair, murmuring softly, his voice as faint as a mosquito's buzz, halting and fragmented: "I was that fallen immortal, drinking the divine brew from the heavenly spring, composing verses amidst the colorful clouds of Baidi City... Watching that iron-faced wave, never feeling satisfied... With no money to my name, I dined on mist and dew, enjoying the cool breeze... Lighting lamps and drinking, could withstand the wrath of wind, rain, and thunder... My master, tipsy, swaying his head, raised his empty cup, asking who prioritizes human heart and heavenly principle, the young boy didn’t answer, bowing his head to sleep, only hearing the chirping of insects echoing with my master’s snores... My master shed his clothes for the boy to wear, staggered and fell, sleeping on the ground, his snoring like thunder, a dream of a thousand autumns in the mortal realm..."

Cui Dongshan suddenly scratched his cheek, feeling somewhat bored. "That's meaningless. Let's change it up. But change to what? Hmm, got it!"

He began humming an unknown folk tune, "A frog with a mouth, two frogs with four legs, splashing into the water, frogs don’t drink water, peaceful years, frogs don’t drink water, peaceful years..."

————

At the Cai family mansion in the capital.

Amidst the quiet arrival of carriages, distinguished guests gathered, all the wise men were present.

Tonight, among the seven or eight people, Cai Feng, currently serving as the second-ranking scholar in the National Academy, was the lowest in rank.

Present were the Left Vice Minister of Rites Guo Xin, Right Vice Minister of War Tao Jiu, the General Miao Ren of the founding merit, and the Deputy Commander of the Infantry Bureau Song Shan, responsible for the capital's safety...

They were mostly young officials from the Great Sui, not particularly old. The eldest among them, Tao Jiu, was only forty-five.

Cai Feng was a tall and handsome youth, with an imposing demeanor that didn’t lose its luster even in front of these high-ranking officials.

This confidence stemmed not only from his own talents but also from the surname of the mansion. Even if Cai Jingshen had become a laughingstock, he was still a Nascent Soul elder who had protected the Great Sui capital for many years.

Everyone was either drinking tea or wine, having already made plans. It was highly likely that the future trajectory of the Great Sui and even the entire Baopingzhou would be decided in tonight's Cai mansion.

In half a month, the Emperor would hold the Thousand Elders Feast, and all actions could be taken before and after that event!

Cai Feng stood up and proclaimed loudly, "Through diligent study of the sage's teachings, we protect the mountains and rivers, ensuring the people are not humiliated, defending the national surname, not allowing foreign surnames to overshadow us. As scholars, we must sacrifice ourselves for righteousness, and now is the time!"

Another newly appointed top scholar from the Hanlin Academy suddenly stood up, throwing his wine cup to the ground, shattering it. With a solemn voice, he declared, "A son cannot have two fathers, and a minister cannot have two lords. I'd rather be shattered like jade than remain whole like a tile! Of the thirty-six generals who founded the Great Sui, most were scholars!"

The crowd was filled with righteous indignation and fervor.

Someone raised their arm and shouted, "Swear to kill the literary demon Mao Xiaodong!"

Another person wept sorrowfully, pounding the armrest repeatedly, "How can the Great Sui bow and scrape to that barbarian Song family, ceding land to seek peace, and suffer defeat without a fight? What a great humiliation!"

The crowd gradually dispersed.

Cai Feng did not send anyone off, as it would draw too much attention.

Although Song Shan had already made arrangements, cleaning up the night patrols around the Cai family, filled only with his loyal subordinates, caution was still wise.

Cai Feng remained alone in the desolate banquet hall, surrounded by lingering scents of wine.

His eyes blazed with fervor.

Who else but Cai Feng could turn the tide?!

Miao Ren and the new top scholar Zhang Dai shared a carriage as they departed.

The two sat across from each other in the carriage.

Miao Ren looked at the composed young man and felt a bit self-deprecating; he was even less steady than this younger generation. No wonder he was regarded as a potential prime minister, alongside the future gentlemen of the Cliffside Academy, Li Changying, Nanxi Chu Tong, and Cai Feng, who were considered the four luminaries of the capital's younger generation. Additionally, there was Pan Yuanchun, son of the late General Pan Maozhen, among the four elites. However, all these were scions of noble families, and after the youngest Pan Yuanchun left the academy to join the military, the four elites were all in the ranks.

These four luminaries and four elites totaled eight, with four coming from noble families and meritorious backgrounds, such as Chu Tong and Pan Yuanchun. The other four came from humble origins, like Zhang Dai and Li Changying.

Miao Ren felt that among the several young men destined for smooth careers, three were caught up in this plot.

Thus, Miao Ren believed that all the spirits of the Great Sui would protect their success.

Miao Ren lifted the carriage curtain and glanced outside; the night was deep, and there was still a long time until dawn.

————

On the way back, Chen Pingan was still pondering the matter Lin Shouyi mentioned. But after thinking it over, he didn’t feel he had done anything worthy of Lin Shouyi's deep gratitude.

If it were about Li Baoping and Li Huai, Chen Pingan wouldn't find it surprising at all.

However, Lin Shouyi was different. Perhaps due to his sensitive background, he had always been meticulous, very opinionated, and had lofty aspirations. Therefore, he had ventured into the path of cultivation early on during his studies, which Chen Pingan found unsurprising.

Zhu Lian, with his keen intuition, did not head straight back to his lodging. Instead, he followed Chen Pingan into the house and quietly asked, "Is there a situation?"

The nominal master and servant had developed an unspoken understanding through their continuous life-and-death battles.

Chen Pingan didn’t hide anything from Zhu Lian. After pouring two bowls of wine, he nodded and said, "The Master of Maoshan informed me that recently in the Great Sui capital, someone is targeting the academy's students. They hope to use the Emperor's Thousand Elders Feast as a pivotal moment, with Great Li's envoys participating. If something goes wrong with the academy, it could incite public anger between the two nations and shatter the delicate balance, possibly igniting border warfare. For the past two years, the officials and common people of the Great Sui, feeling humiliated by the Gao family's subservience to the barbaric Great Li, have been harboring resentment. From the aggrieved civil and military officials to the indignant scholars, and even the confused common folk, once an opportunity arises..."

Zhu Lian interjected, "A spark can ignite a prairie fire, and it’ll be uncontrollable. The Great Sui will have no way to turn back, and even the Gao family will be forced to tear up the alliance."

Chen Pingan replied calmly, "Such matters of court affairs are as they are. I understand, so I originally wouldn't interfere. ‘Not in the position, don’t discuss politics’—it’s the same logic as walking the rivers and lakes, each bearing life and death. However, it concerns Baoping and them..."

Chen Pingan drained his bowl of wine and fell silent.

Zhu Lian was slightly surprised.

A heavy killing intent surged within him.

Zhu Lian hesitated to speak.

Chen Pingan’s expression was tranquil. "I know."

He poured another bowl of wine. "The more I practice swordsmanship, the more I am affected by the sword immortal Wei Jin, who cleaved through the night with a single strike, and the slaughtering in the Jiao Long Valley. I, of small courage, fear nothing more than to act on a whim. However, after being gravely injured by Du Mao's swallowing sword boat and later confronting my enemy Li Baozhen, I have increasingly realized that my mind is troubled. It may even relate to my shattered fate from the beginning; it’s all very troublesome."

Zhu Lian expressed concern, "Then what should young master do? This seems to involve a mental knot... or perhaps the heart demon of a cultivator?"

Chen Pingan raised his wine bowl and clinked it with Zhu Lian’s, smiling. "Read more."

Seeing Zhu Lian's puzzled expression, Chen Pingan sighed wryly. "I’m not joking with you."

Zhu Lian took a sip of wine and shook his head.

If this wasn’t a joke, then what would be?

Chen Pingan spoke softly, "Before I reached Donghua Mountain Academy, I had been intentionally and unintentionally delving deeply into the sage's texts. Why did I read Legalist writings while in Qingluan Kingdom? Because I discovered that only reading Confucian texts didn't fully align with my inexpressible intrinsic motivations; the effect was limited. Hence, at Cui Dongshan's suggestion, I sought to verify Confucian moral writings against the fundamental teachings of the Legalists. Looking back now, it has indeed proven useful. When I arrived at the academy and saw the ruler's token at the waist of the Maoshan Master, with the engraved words, I suddenly felt enlightened, recognizing that I was on the right path. It was just that I had been wandering in the dark, acting on intuition, uncertain of my destination. You may not realize it, but I, Chen Pingan, fear that kind of..."

Chen Pingan began to formulate his words.

Zhu Lian tentatively suggested, "Drawing the sword and looking around, the heart is confused."

Chen Pingan laughed, "That’s somewhat it. As long as I see... someone standing far away, or high up, no matter how far, I won't be afraid."

Chen Pingan lightly traced characters on the table with his finger, saying slowly, "The sage says: ‘Act according to the heart's desire without overstepping the bounds.’ This is the remedy to my problem."

Zhu Lian held his wine bowl, feeling unsure whether to drink or not.

Chen Pingan burst into laughter. "Do you need a reason to drink? Let’s go for it!"

The two drained their bowls.

Chen Pingan thought that since martial artists gain experience in life-and-death situations, enhancing their cultivation, then as a Qi practitioner, he could also temper his heart through hardship, finding joy in the struggle, treating it as a training ground for slaying dragons—wasn’t that acceptable?

It was just like the time on the ferry in the Chengtian Kingdom when Zhu Lian had thrown a punch at Pei Qian, allowing her to dodge.

Shi Rou wasn’t merely a martial artist and didn’t understand how Pei Qian had instinctively avoided that punch from a realm-breaker, but Zhu Lian, not being a cultivator, didn’t comprehend the terror that earth immortals held towards heart demons.

After drinking.

Zhu Lian began to habitually calculate. "I heard from Shi Rou that last time at the Lion Garden, young master almost got into a fight with that sword room woman, Liu Boqi, nearly drawing his long sword. But Shi Rou noticed that even when young master merely gripped the sword hilt, his palm got scalded afterward? He had to retract his hand into his sleeve to avoid Liu Boqi discovering the truth?"

Chen Pingan nodded, "There’s no other way. Semi-immortal soldiers are just that hard to serve."

Zhu Lian looked puzzled.

Regarding the battle between the Lotus Flower Blessed Land and Ding Ying, Chen Pingan had explained it in detail, essentially replaying the chess game between master and servant.

Chen Pingan clarified, "The ‘Long Qi’ sword I mentioned before, although of a higher rank, was mostly unfettered by that old sword immortal. Otherwise, I would never have been able to draw it out, and the Fuyuan family of Old Dragon City, as the ‘Sword Immortal’ for reparations, on one hand, knew that giving it to me meant that for a long time to come, the so-called semi-immortal soldier would merely be a hindrance. Furthermore, this was also abiding by the rules; they helped unlock all the restrictions, meaning that this sword immortal's sword was like a house with the door key missing. It fell into my hands and could be used; if it accidentally fell into someone else's hands, it could enter and exit freely. It was rather a malicious act."

Chen Pingan reached out and grasped the sword immortal from the bed, saying, "I’ve been using minor refining methods to peel back those secret arts and restrictions. The progress is slow; I probably need to reach the seventh realm of martial arts to unravel all the restrictions one by one, using it as one would one’s own fingers. Right now, drawing it means inflicting a thousand damage to the enemy while harming myself eight hundred; unless absolutely necessary, it’s best not to use it."

Zhu Lian understood, took a sip of wine, and then slowly said, "Li Baoping, Li Huai, Lin Shouyi, Yu Lu, and Xie Xue. All five come from the Great Li. The assassination of Yu Lu holds little significance; Xie Xue has explicitly revealed his identity as a remnant of the Lu dynasty. Although he was once a talented cultivator of the first immortal family, this identity limits his weight. As for the first three, they all hail from the Li Pearl Cave Sky, being disciples personally taught by Master Qi from years ago. Among them, Li Baoping and Li Huai have the best backgrounds—one with a great ancestor as a Nascent Soul patron of the Great Li, and the other with a father who is a peak grandmaster. If anything happens to either, the Great Li will not rest easy. One is unwilling, the other dares not."

Chen Pingan did not mention Li Xisheng to Zhu Lian, so Zhu Lian assumed the "dares not" referred to Li Huai, whose father was Li Er.

Years ago, Li Xisheng had faced a nine-realm sword cultivator with his six-realm Qi practitioner cultivation at Niping Lane, showing impeccable defense and never falling behind.

Later, while drawing talismans in the Bamboo Pavilion at Falling Into Ruins Mountain, every word was like a mountain, causing the entire Falling Into Ruins Mountain to sink.

In truth, these were not particularly important.

For Chen Pingan, the safety of Li Baoping was most critical.

Chen Pingan poured Zhu Lian another bowl of wine. "Why does it seem that whenever you follow me, there are no peaceful days?"

Zhu Lian drank deeply, wiping his mouth and smiling. "Young master, if you had entered the Lotus Flower Blessed Land earlier and met the old servant at his most glorious time, you wouldn’t say such things. Life and death have always been a matter of a snap of the fingers."

Chen Pingan laughed, "When I won against Ding Ying, it was partly due to his overconfidence. If I had encountered someone like you, who disregards the manner of a master, I’d probably have been the one to die."

Zhu Lian quickly finished his bowl of wine, shamelessly extending his wine bowl. "Just for what young master said, the old servant ought to drink another bowl of penalty wine."

Chen Pingan indeed poured Zhu Lian another bowl of wine, feeling a bit sentimental. "I hope that whether it’s ten years or a hundred years from now, we’ll often have chances like this to drink together."

Zhu Lian grinned. "What could be difficult about that?"

Chen Pingan had already drunk more than usual tonight.

After parting ways, Chen Pingan went to Mao Xiaodong’s study, discussing the matter of refining his fate object in detail, as there was nothing too excessive.

In the dark of night.

Chen Pingan walked alone.

————

Before the lights were extinguished in the academy.

Pei Qian blushed. "Sister Baoping, I don’t sleep well."

Li Baoping thought for a moment and moved the small mountain of copied books that occupied one bed to stack it on top of another small mountain of books.

The two lay in their respective bedding, with Li Baoping lying straight, saying the words "sleeping" before falling asleep almost instantly.

Pei Qian carefully tossed and turned, taking a long time to drift off.

When she woke up the next day, she felt like a dumpling, wrapped warmly in her blanket. Turning her head, Pei Qian saw that Li Baoping's bedding was arranged so neatly it looked like it had been cut from tofu. Pei Qian thought of how she carelessly threw her bedding together, and feeling a bit guilty, she comfortably went back to sleep. She needed to rest well to continue dealing with the oblivious Li Huai and the two even denser fellows.

As for arm wrestling with Li Baoping, Pei Qian thought she would wait until she was of similar age to Li Baoping. After all, she was younger, and losing to Li Baoping wasn’t embarrassing.

Next year, she would be twelve, and Li Baoping would be thirteen, so she would still be a year older; Pei Qian didn’t care. Next year would still be next year, with countless tomorrows ahead, which was quite nice.

After getting up early, Li Baoping hurried to find Chen Pingan. With no one in the guesthouse, she dashed to Mao Xiaodong’s courtyard.

Waiting at the door.

As the Confucian sage who governed the academy, Mao Xiaodong could see everything that happened in the academy as long as he wanted to, so he simply told Chen Pingan that Li Baoping was waiting outside.

Chen Pingan left the study to bring Li Baoping back. On the way, he mentioned that they couldn’t explore the Great Sui capital today.

Upon learning that Chen Pingan would need to stay at the academy for at least a month, Li Baoping didn’t rush, thinking she would explore some places she hadn’t been to. Otherwise, she would just take Pei Qian along, but Chen Pingan suggested they should first show Pei Qian around the academy, visiting the Confucius Hall, the Library, and the Flying Bird Pavilion, all the famous sites of Donghua Mountain. Li Baoping thought that was a good idea. Before they reached the study, she hurriedly ran off, saying she wanted to accompany Pei Qian for breakfast.

Mao Xiaodong smiled and said, "Worrying about encountering an assassination while not wanting to disappoint Li Baoping; doesn’t that feel quite troublesome?"

Chen Pingan nodded. "Indeed, it’s quite a dilemma."

Mao Xiaodong asked, "Don’t you want to know which influential families of the Great Sui are plotting this?"

Chen Pingan shook his head. "Even in this academy, it’s still part of the Great Sui territory."

"The immediate priority is still your refining matter."

Mao Xiaodong waved his hand. "Cui Dongshan speaks nonsense, but he does say one thing that makes sense: our academy stands on the foundation of life, and learning is vital for survival."

Mao Xiaodong stood up and walked slowly. "Buddhists say to let go of attachments; the various sufferings of this life can be avoided, which is a form of great freedom. Daoists pursue purity, avoiding worldly suffering like a boat gliding through the void, achieving true leisure. Only we Confucians face challenges head-on. People in this world suffer in this life; we do not escape or avoid. On the path, the sage's books are like lamps lighting the way for people."

Chen Pingan couldn’t help but softly say, "Though there are countless people, I will still go."

Mao Xiaodong paused, deeply agreeing, and sighed, "Indeed, that’s the principle!"

————

In just two hours, Li Baoping had taken Pei Qian on a whirlwind tour of the academy. If it weren’t for having to patiently explain things to Pei Qian, she could have wrapped it up in an hour.

Finally, Li Baoping led Pei Qian to the towering tree atop Donghua Mountain. They climbed the branches one after another, gazing at the distance from high above. Li Baoping extended her finger to tell Pei Qian about the attractions and delicacies in the Great Sui capital, recalling them with great detail, as if the entire capital was her family’s courtyard.

Pei Qian stole a glance at Li Baoping.

One could imagine her sister Baoping, clad in a red dress or a red cotton jacket, standing here for years, waiting for her little master uncle.

The two sat on the tree branches, and Li Baoping took out a red handkerchief, opening it to reveal two soft sweet cakes, and they each took a piece to nibble on.

Pei Qian said she could wander on her own in the afternoon.

Li Baoping nodded in agreement. She said that an esteemed old master from outside the academy, known for his great reputation, was coming to teach a lesson on a certain Confucian classic. Since her little master uncle had business to attend to today, she wanted to go listen to what this old master from the far south had to say and see if he was really as knowledgeable as rumored.

Pei Qian timidly asked, "Sister Baoping, do you understand?"

Li Baoping nodded and shook her head. "The books I copied actually explain it all, but I have so many questions that I can’t figure out. The academy's teachers either advise me not to be overly ambitious, saying it’s better to ask that Li Changying. Even if they tell me, I won’t understand. But I don’t quite get it. If they don’t say anything, how would they know I wouldn’t understand? Forget it; they’re teachers, so I can’t say that. This kind of thing just has to roll around in my stomach. Some teachers also beat around the bush; in any case, they can never give me an answer like Master Qi does each time. And none of them are like my little master uncle, who tells me what he knows and admits when he doesn’t know something. That’s why I prefer to often run outside the academy. You probably don’t know, but our academy’s first mountain master taught me, Li Huai, and Lin Shouyi in our early studies. Master Qi said that all learning ultimately comes down to the word ‘action.’ How do we interpret ‘action’? It has two layers of meaning: one is to travel thousands of miles to broaden knowledge, and the other is to integrate and apply what we’ve learned to cultivate oneself, govern the family, and bring peace to the state. Since I'm still young, I can only run around more."

As she spoke about these things, Pei Qian noticed that it was rare for Li Baoping to furrow her brows.

Pei Qian couldn’t help but sigh sincerely, "Sister Baoping, you think so much."

Li Baoping noticed that Pei Qian hadn’t finished her sweet cake and was nibbling it like a little mouse eating corn, and couldn’t help but laugh, patting Pei Qian’s shoulder. "Your little master uncle thinks more."

Li Baoping swung her legs seriously and said, "Cui Dongshan once said that one day, my little master uncle would meet the girl he likes the most. I would only be second in his heart. Maybe one day in the future, I’ll also meet someone I like more, and my little master uncle would be second in my heart. I think Cui Dongshan is talking nonsense. If my little master uncle has someone he likes, I wouldn’t mind, but how could I like someone more than my little master uncle, right, Pei Qian?"

Pei Qian quickly nodded.

Li Baoping was satisfied with Pei Qian’s attitude. She patted her shoulder, earnestly saying, "When you travel the rivers and lakes with my little master uncle, you must work hard and be more sensible. Being naughty is fine, but don’t be overly mischievous, causing my little master uncle worry. My little master uncle, your teacher, isn’t someone who just fell from the sky. He may also have worries and heartaches that need to be drowned in wine. So you need to be more understanding. Can you do that? You see, my little master uncle didn’t drink back then, but now he drinks, which shows that you, as the first disciple, haven’t done well enough, right?"

Pei Qian nodded again, feeling genuinely convinced.

Regarding lending her that silver gourd and the narrow knife symbol, Li Baoping recounted what Chen Pingan had said to Zhong Kui, which was essentially the same.

At that moment, Pei Qian finally admitted that there was a reason for Li Baoping calling Chen Pingan her little master uncle.

The two then slid down the big tree one after the other.

Li Baoping was heading to listen to that distant old master’s lecture, darting away among the crowd of old masters and young academy students, undoubtedly the youngest among them and strikingly dressed in bright red.

Pei Qian timed her arrival at the same moment as Li Huai and the others were leaving class.

The three continued to walk together.

Liu Guan asked, "Ma Lian, tell me, if someone in the family becomes an official and receives a royal edict, is it really as Pei Qian said, that there are so many taboos just for placement?"

Ma Lian nodded vigorously. "There are indeed some minor discrepancies, but generally speaking, it’s just as she said."

"And Pei Qian said that her bed when she was little was really that big, capable of holding so many random things?"

Ma Lian nodded again. "Yes, my sister has one!"

Liu Guan sighed. "Well then, she truly is a princess of a noble family! So how should we greet her next time we meet? Is a deep bow sufficient? We can’t just kneel and kowtow, can we?"

Ma Lian looked troubled. "The Emperor and the princes and princesses have been to my house, but I was too young back then to remember anything."

Li Huai joyfully said, "What’s the big deal about a princess? Isn’t she just Chen Pingan’s disciple? When we meet her, we can all treat it like a casual encounter in the rivers and lakes, standing on equal footing and cupping our hands in greeting."

Liu Guan nodded. "That sounds good. Besides, she has said herself that she’s a person of the rivers and lakes, so we don’t need to lose face."

They saw Pei Qian at the door.

The three clasped their hands in greeting.

Pei Qian raised an eyebrow and returned the gesture.

They entered the academy.

Pei Qian quickly began to vividly describe a recent conflict in the rivers and lakes.

A group of reckless highway bandits had suddenly charged from the grass on both sides, dozens of burly men wielding various weapons, from knives and guns to sticks.

The leader, brandishing a large axe, pointed the blade directly at her master, roaring with a voice as thunderous as a clap of thunder, "This road is mine! If you want to pass, leave your life behind!" If you were in that situation, would you be afraid?!

Ma Lian nodded.

Liu Guan chuckled, "Anyway, your master is here. They’re just a bunch of bandits; why be afraid?"

Pei Qian crossed her arms and shot Liu Guan a look. "My master would retort, if you don’t fork over the money, then how about it? You don’t know how heroic my master was back then; the wind blew through the grass, and even without moving, my master had the demeanor of a master who could effortlessly take the head of a general from a sea of enemies. Looking at those countless bandits, they were nothing more than... a bunch of small fry, chickens and dogs, fighting over the spoils!"

Pei Qian couldn’t help but admire herself; those novels about battlefields and rivers and lakes she had read hadn’t been in vain, and were now coming in handy.

Liu Guan was impatient. "We've heard enough about how powerful your master is. Unmatched in fist techniques, invincible in swordsmanship—he's a sword immortal and a grandmaster of martial arts. I already know that. I just want to know how the situation developed next!"

Pei Qian widened her eyes. "Do you think the rivers and lakes only consist of reckless fighting and killing? People in the rivers and lakes, whether heroes or honorable thieves, regardless of their cultivation level, are all living beings! And none of them are fools!"

Liu Guan, after receiving the lecture, miraculously did not retort.

Pei Qian ran forward, pretending to make a fierce face, and then turned around. "The bandit leader was furious, raising the heavy axe weighing seventy or eighty jins, and in a fit of rage, asked my master, ‘Kid, are you tired of living?! Are you looking to die?!’"

Pei Qian took a few steps and turned back, "Only to hear my master, calm and collected, respond with a single word: ‘Want.’ In an instant, the wind howled, and the bandits began to clamour, their morale surging."

Ma Lian and Liu Guan listened with rapt attention.

Li Huai munched on seeds.

Having seen great sights with Chen Pingan, he was not intimidated by a mere group of bandits.

Pei Qian ran ahead, feigning a fierce expression, turning back to say, "Only to hear that guy snarl, ‘Hey, kid, do you even know how to write the word ‘death’?!’"

Pei Qian ran back again, "My master replied with two words: ‘Know.’"

Then Pei Qian immediately made a motion of writing the character for ‘death’ in the air with her finger, turning back to the three. "At that moment, I made this gesture; how about it?"

Ma Lian looked dazed.

Liu Guan applauded in delight.

Pei Qian walked to the table, where Ma Lian had prepared tea earlier. She took a sip to moisten her throat and continued, "The group of bandits erupted into chaos, pounding their chests and stomping their feet like drums on the battlefield. The leader roared to the heavens, his eyes bulging like copper bells, issuing orders to his goons, ‘Brothers, grab your weapons and kill this pretentious brat! Especially that little girl with the sword at her waist! Don’t be fooled by her age; she looks like a seasoned rivers and lakes veteran, with profound cultivation not to be underestimated...’"

Pei Qian suddenly stopped her storytelling.

A warm hand rested on her head.

Pei Qian turned her head and smiled, somewhat displeased, "Master, you’re here. I was just telling Li Huai and the others..."

Pei Qian had originally planned to confess that she was simply making things up.

But unexpectedly, Chen Pingan had already smiled and said, "Alright, Li Huai and the others are still students of the academy. You shouldn't discuss these rivers and lakes matters too much. In the future, if possible, when you become friends, you can travel and study together with Li Huai, Liu Guan, and Ma Lian. At that time, you can share your stories with them in detail."

Pei Qian heavily agreed, full of excitement.

Chen Pingan let Li Huai eat with his friends first and planned to find him afterward. He then took Pei Qian to look for Li Baoping.

On the way, Chen Pingan quietly reminded her, "If there is really a chance in the future to travel and study together with Li Huai and the others, remember one thing: at that time, you must clearly express how much martial arts cultivation you have and how deep your experiences in the rivers and lakes are. Don’t boast about yourself, making them think that the so-called rivers and lakes are nothing more than this; otherwise, things will easily go wrong. Remember that?"

Pei Qian nodded. "I remember!"

Chen Pingan spoke seriously. "Keep it in mind."

Pei Qian grinned. "I’ll write it down word for word on a bamboo slip!"

As Chen Pingan walked along a secluded path in the academy, he felt inspired and spoke softly, "Why travel the rivers and lakes? It’s not merely to pursue beautiful scenery, nor just to practice martial arts to become stronger. We must also see better people in the rivers and lakes than ourselves."

"Like me, when I saw Zhang Shanfeng starving on the ferry at Jiao Mountain, or Xu Yuanxia, who rushed into a ghost house with a heroic spirit, or the old sword saint from Shuishui Kingdom appearing in a dilapidated ancient temple, or that seemingly terrifying yet loving ghost couple, or Fan Er from Old Dragon City, or Liu Youzhou from the Upside-down Mountain... I too feel a sense of shame, admiration, and envy, and occasionally even some jealousy."

Pei Qian exclaimed in surprise, "Master feels this way too?"

Chen Pingan ruffled her little head. "You think? Master also has emotions and desires, and has many of my own flaws. I don’t like those who look down on me, and there are quite a few. But when I see better people, I can’t just watch; I must admire them. Even if I cannot reach them, my heart must yearn for them..."

Pei Qian's steps slowed down.

After walking a dozen steps, Chen Pingan turned around and saw the little girl standing still, smiling and asking, "What’s wrong?"

Pei Qian smiled, "Sister Baoping said her little master uncle isn’t someone who fell from the sky, but I feel that Master must have fallen from the sky back then."

Chen Pingan smiled. "Why not tell your Baoping sister this?"

Pei Qian quickly ran towards Chen Pingan, "I’m not stupid!"

Earlier, watching her master’s back.

Pei Qian suddenly felt a bit sentimental.

While walking through the mountains and rivers, amidst their long journey,

They had once encountered a pile of rolling stones on a muddy mountain road during heavy rain.

Pei Qian thought they could just go around.

But her master would stop in the rain, lifting each stone from the road.

Under the dark rain, her master, dressed in white, was busy.

They had also paused by a well-maintained wooden bridge along the tea-horse road, where her master stood staring for a long time before running off into the mountains alone, chopping down large trees, bringing them back, splitting them into planks, and after dropping the hatchet, he replaced it with a hammer, rhythmically repairing the bridge.

*(End of Chapter)*### Chapter 406: Battle at the Mountain Summit

The old scholar visiting Donghua Mountain was invited by the vice principal of the Cliffside Academy to give a lecture this afternoon at the Learning Hall.

Chen Ping'an walked with Pei Qian through the corridor, and just outside the lush green Learning Hall, they happened upon the end of the lecture. Li Baoping flitted through the crowd like a small koi, nimbly making her way out of the courtyard. Once outside, she quickly clenched her fist as a self-congratulation. Spotting Chen Ping'an and Pei Qian, she picked up her pace. Watching Li Baoping dash through the academy, Pei Qian couldn’t help but admire her even more; Sister Baoping truly feared nothing.

After the three met up, they headed toward the guesthouse together. Li Baoping shared many amusing stories with Chen Ping'an, such as how, during the old scholar’s lecture, there was a snow-white deer sitting beside him. It was said that when this scholar founded his private academy long ago, the heavens responded with the deer guarding him, allowing the academy nestled deep in the mountains to remain safe from wild beasts and mountain spirits.

In conclusion, Li Baoping remarked that the white deer beside Zhao the old scholar didn’t seem as spirited or beautiful as the one brought to their Lizhu Cave Heaven by Sister He from the Divine Revelation Sect.

The mere mention of He Xiaoliang made Chen Ping'an’s head spin. He couldn’t help but feel a headache when he thought of his future plans, wishing he would never have to see the woman who once had the best of fortunes in the land again.

Years ago, by the rocky cliffs along the Longxu River, Chen Ping'an first met He Xiaoliang, who represented the Divine Revelation Sect. After seeing the deer, he casually asked Cui Dongshan about it later, only to learn that the snow-white appearance was merely an illusion cast by Daoist Lord Qi Zhen; in reality, it was a multicolored deer coveted by practitioners at the fifth realm. Only those with luck and fortune could keep such a creature by their side.

Back then, the sect leader Lu Chen used supreme Daoist techniques to build a bridge of fortune between him and He Xiaoliang, allowing them to share their fortunes after the Lizhu Cave Heaven collapsed. This was, of course, part of Lu Chen’s profound planning to align with Mr. Qi’s literary lineage. This kind of mental tug-of-war was perilous; had it been anyone else, they might have ended up as mere puppets in the White Jade Capital’s twelve-story pavilions, appearing prosperous but trapped.

Thus, Chen Ping'an felt deeply about the phrase "Fortune and misfortune are intertwined."

However, although Chen Ping'an hadn’t been pulled toward the White Jade Capital by Lu Chen, he had unknowingly developed many "root causes" of troubles. For instance, he had always harbored a resistance to seeking out the secret realms of shattered paradises. It wasn’t until his travels with Lu Tai and later the offhand comments from Zhu Lian that he began to seek change, solidifying his determination for the inevitable journey to the North Julu Continent.

That place, known for its countless sword cultivators and being the most martial in the world, was one where even Confucian scholars would lose their temper and strike at earth immortals just to make their point.

Chen Ping'an wanted to go there to practice swordsmanship.

Just by himself.

Purely to practice swordsmanship.

He smiled and asked, "How was the lecture, Scholar?"

Li Baoping pondered for a moment and replied, "I read a book that had a fan of Zhao the old scholar who said that his lectures were like a solitary crane flying east over the river, suddenly calling out, as the river surged under a bright moon. I listened for a long time and felt there was some truth to it, though not as exaggerated as the book made it sound. However, the old scholar's greatest strength lay in his insights when gazing out from towers, connecting poetry and prose with the ancient sages, resonating through the ages. He elaborated on his theories of natural order. Yet, during this lecture, he only picked one Confucian classic for interpretation and didn’t showcase the core teachings of their lineage. I was a bit disappointed; if I hadn’t been in a rush to find my junior master, I would have asked the scholar when he would discuss the principles of heaven and human hearts."

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and asked, "Is this old scholar from the lineage of the South Posa Continent’s Ehu Academy, the Lu Sage?"

Li Baoping beamed with a smile, "You know so much, Junior Master! Indeed, this Zhao the old scholar's ancestor is that Lu Sage, known for having a 'heart that embraces the world, observing the vast seas.'"

Recalling the entry about Lu Sage in the "Shan Hai Zhi" he had gifted to Yu Lu, Chen Ping'an remembered that Lu Sage had a good relationship with the Chen family of the Pure Confucian Sect. He wondered if Liu Xianyang would have the chance to meet him.

Pei Qian had been wanting to chime in but felt lost amidst the conversation and worried that speaking might expose her ignorance, so she felt a bit dejected.

Fortunately, Chen Ping'an tugged at Pei Qian’s ear and admonished, "Did you see? Your Sister Baoping knows so much about various schools of thought and their core teachings. Although you’re not a student of the academy and studying isn’t your main pursuit..."

Pei Qian stomped her foot, feeling wronged. "Master, she’s Sister Baoping! How can I compare? If it were someone else, like Li Huai, who has been studying in the academy for so many years, then I would definitely be at a disadvantage!"

Chen Ping'an stopped his teasing, laughed heartily, and patted Pei Qian's head. "Only you could be so clever."

Upon returning to the guesthouse, they found Yu Lu waiting there early, standing side by side with Zhu Lian under the eaves, seemingly getting along well.

With Yu Lu around, Chen Ping'an felt much more at ease.

During the earlier stir at the academy, it was Yu Lu who quietly stepped in and decisively forced the scholar Li Changying off Donghua Mountain in the presence of a sword cultivator.

After dinner, Chen Ping'an continued to discuss refining his destined object with Mao Xiaodong, asking Yu Lu to look after Pei Qian. Yu Lu happily agreed.

After Chen Ping'an left, Li Baoping mentioned she was going back to her study to take notes on the lecture, and Pei Qian found an excuse not to follow her. Instead, she went to Chen Ping'an’s guesthouse to retrieve a bamboo box, taking out the treasure box. She had a private duel with Li Huai scheduled at the summit of Donghua Mountain.

Yu Lu accompanied Pei Qian up the mountain while Zhu Lian discreetly left, following Chen Ping'an's instructions to protect Li Baoping from the shadows.

Upon reaching the summit of Donghua Mountain, Li Huai was already seated upright, a lovely yellow wooden box placed in front of him.

Pei Qian grinned and set her treasure box on the table.

Yu Lu squatted on a stone bench, watching the two children confront each other, finding it quite amusing.

Seeing the treasure box, Li Huai immediately took a defensive stance. "Pei Qian, you go first!"

Pei Qian scoffed and opened the treasure box gifted by Yao Jin, revealing a nine-grid layout filled with exquisite wooden carvings of spiritual mushrooms, along with several rare coins bought by Yao Jin, considered prized collectibles, and a heavily weathered Taoist talisman carved with an image of a deity with a red face and a long beard, wearing golden armor and a red robe, with a heavenly eye on his forehead. After Chen Ping'an’s appraisal, aside from the talisman and spiritual mushrooms, most were merely worldly treasures, not considered immortal artifacts.

Pei Qian carefully took out the talisman and placed it on the table. "Here, take this!"

Li Huai opened the lovely yellow box and retrieved a mud figurine of a swordsman with crossed arms. "I have a sword immortal to fend off enemies and slay foes. What will you do?"

Pei Qian immediately pulled out the wooden spiritual mushroom, "Even if your sword immortal strikes me, this mushroom is a great tonic and can save my life! Your turn!"

Li Huai grunted and pulled out a second mud figurine, this one depicting a drummer. "I'll beat the drums and annoy you to death!"

Pei Qian coldly laughed as she laid down the rare coins on the table. "Money can make the world go round. Beware, your little lackey might turn on you and make a racket outside your window! Now it’s your turn!"

Li Huai presented his third figurine, a clay statue of an armored general. "This general is the most loyal to me. Using money will only result in wasted effort!"

Then he took out a figurine of a Taoist priest with a whisk. "This is a deity who resides in a mountain temple. With one sweep of his whisk, he can turn rivers and seas upside down. Do you concede?"

This time, Pei Qian didn’t retrieve anything from her treasure box but cautiously pulled out a fragrant pouch of money gifted by Gui Furen from her sleeve. She turned away and emptied out the private coins and bay leaves from it, hiding them before placing the pouch, which emitted a refreshing fragrance, on the table. "This pouch can hold any immortal technique or treasure. What’s a stinking old Taoist’s whisk worth?"

Then she placed a clear and lovely bay branch on the table, boasting, "This is a branch from the moon palace’s laurel tree. Throw it on the ground, and tomorrow a laurel tree taller than a building will grow!"

Li Huai quickly took out his last clay figurine, resembling an immortal riding a crane. "My maid’s mount is a celestial crane, capable of stealing your laurel branch!"

Pei Qian unsheathed her bamboo sword and struck it heavily on the table. "One sword to chop off the crane’s claws, and one strike to behead your maid!"

Finally, Li Huai presented his prized painted wooden puppet, towering over the previous set of mud figurines gifted by the Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple. "One hand will grasp your sword, and the other will seize your knife!"

After that, both children began using every means at their disposal.

Pei Qian had a few well-practiced items, while the rest of her treasure box contained valuable yet useless worldly possessions.

Li Huai then unveiled a book titled "The Great Cliff of Broken Water," even bringing out the essence that Ah Liang had once pushed into the pages, stating its significance.

However, overall, Pei Qian held the upper hand.

The stone table was adorned with a dazzling array of treasures from both Pei Qian and Li Huai.

Yu Lu watched the two children’s rivalry with great interest.

In the end, Li Huai sighed heavily and cupped his fists. "Fine, I concede. I’m outmatched; my skills are lacking. I, Li Huai, a man of integrity, can accept defeat!"

Pei Qian crossed her arms and nodded, looking at Li Huai with admiration. "It’s fine; you could say that defeat is still honorable. In the realm, very few heroes can engage in so many rounds with me!"

Li Huai turned to Yu Lu and said, "Yu Lu, you are fortunate to have witnessed this peak battle; it’s a blessing."

Pei Qian, with an air of maturity, responded, "I’m not one to seek hollow fame in the martial world, so Yu Lu, just remember it for yourself; no need to spread it around."

Li Huai and Pei Qian exchanged a knowing glance and smiled in unison.

They recognized each other’s talents.

Pei Qian thought that when Li Huai traveled for his studies in the future, she would ensure he understood what it meant to be a true martial expert and the pinnacle of swordsmanship and domineering sword techniques.

Li Huai considered that when he left the academy to roam the world, he would definitely drag Pei Qian along for adventures, finding comfort in their shared conversations.

Yu Lu silently squatted to the side, marveling.

He was impressed not only by the precious possessions the two children had but also by their thick skins and mutual affinity.

Since Li Huai had skipped class, there were no other academy students or visitors at the summit, saving Yu Lu a lot of trouble as the two began to leisurely gather their belongings.

As the prince of the Lu Dynasty, Yu Lu was aware that the Lu family was known for their treasure troves in the northern part of the Baoping Continent; among their group, aside from Chen Ping'an, his insight likely surpassed even those who cultivated on the mountain. Thus, he knew that the possessions of the two children could rival those of the Dragon Gate realm practitioners and even some Earth Immortals among the wild cultivators. If they excluded their destined items, they still had an impressive fortune.

Yu Lu joked with Pei Qian, "Aren’t you worried I might get greedy for your treasures?"

He knew Li Huai's character very well—he was ambitious and would not entertain such thoughts.

Pei Qian rolled her eyes at Yu Lu, feeling disdainful. "You’re my master’s friend. How could I not trust your character?"

Yu Lu was left speechless.

————

In the study, after they finished discussing the details of refining the item, Mao Xiaodong tapped her waist ruler, and various heavenly materials and earthly treasures suitable for refining the golden literary talisman floated out, landing on the table. There were a total of eighteen types, varying in size and price, but six were still lacking. Four of these could soon be delivered to the Cliffside Academy, while two were trickier to obtain—not easily replaceable, but their absence would somewhat affect the final quality of the golden literary talisman. After all, Mao Xiaodong had high hopes that Chen Ping'an could refine a flawless destined object here in Donghua Mountain, establishing the second energy residence.

Mao Xiaodong had some words stuck in her throat that she didn’t share with Chen Ping'an. First, she wanted to give him a pleasant surprise, and second, she was concerned that he might become overly anxious, worrying about gains and losses, which wouldn’t be ideal.

Once the golden literary talisman was successfully refined, it would be akin to a noble opening a mansion or a general raising a banner on the battlefield, significantly accelerating the absorption of spiritual energy at specific times and places, such as the metal-affiliated Earthly Branches—Geng, Xin, Shen, and You. Ideal locations for absorbing spiritual energy would be directly west and southwest in places rich with spiritual mountains and clear waters. Moreover, metal signifies righteousness and martial prowess, so if a practitioner was chivalrous and had a strong, resolute character filled with a killing intent, they would achieve results with half the effort, hence the saying, "The autumn wind rises, resounding like bells and drums; who fears not having a great name in court?"

However, these mysteries were potentials inherent to all golden destined objects in the world. Chen Ping'an’s golden literary talisman held a deeper layer of opportunity.

Mao Xiaodong learned about this from a very obscure and esoteric compilation, something even Cui Dongshan wouldn’t know.

Refining a high-quality golden literary talisman as a destined object was exceptionally rare and nearly impossible to encounter. Moreover, it required the person refining it not only to be fortunate and skilled in martial matters but also to possess a temperament that resonated with the literary essence within the talisman. Only by employing superior refining techniques, with every step perfectly executed without any flaws, could the final product reach a profound realm where "morality is embodied, thus not swayed by external objects."

Entering a place filled with filth and evil spirits, it couldn’t be guaranteed that one would be impervious to all malevolence, letting all ghostly entities avoid them by three feet. However, at the very least, one could suppress and overcome those entities not recognized as orthodox by the world of righteousness.

This effect resembled ancient dragons dwelling in rivers and lakes, possessing an innate ability to command and intimidate countless aquatic beings.

Mao Xiaodong collected her thoughts while Chen Ping'an carefully examined the heavenly materials and earthly treasures. She slowly said, "During these days, we should avoid busy days with too many onlookers. Instead, we’ll visit the Confucian Temple and other places rich in literary energy in the Great Sui Capital at night. I need to retrieve and advance some literary luck from those deities. Some of this luck is what our Cliffside Academy has... ‘deposited’ with them. To put it in mercantile terms, it’s essentially a share of the profits. The Gao clan of the Great Sui royal family and the Ministry of Rites will turn a blind eye to it, as it’s only about retrieving it for Donghua Mountain, just as you said; Donghua Mountain is still part of the Great Sui territory."

Mao Xiaodong reminded him, "During this time, just stand by my side without needing to say anything. The reason I’m bringing you along is to see if there’s a unique opportunity for you. What? Do you feel awkward? Chen Ping'an, that’s where you’ve misunderstood. You only know the surface of the Confucian literary disputes; you’re not grasping the meaning behind it. For now, don’t worry about these things; just do as I say. It’s not like I’m asking you to recognize which lineage to affiliate with. No need to be tense."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Alright."

Mao Xiaodong then frankly said, "Right now, the Great Sui Capital is brewing with ominous winds and rain, quite unstable. This time, I brought you away from the academy, intending to help you escape a dilemma, but it will be dangerous—very dangerous. Do you have any thoughts?"

Mao Xiaodong was clearly positioning herself as bait.

Chen Ping'an replied with concern, "Of course, I’m willing, but if you, the Master of Maoshan, leave the academy, it’s equivalent to leaving a sanctuary. If the opponent comes prepared, the first target will be you, the Maoshan Master at the academy. Wouldn’t that be extremely dangerous?"

"To deal with me, even if I left Donghua Mountain, they would need a jade purity realm practitioner to be confident."

Mao Xiaodong laughed heartily, "But do you think the jade purity realm practitioners in Baoping Continent are just the little trinkets that Pei Qian and Li Huai collected? They can’t be casually displayed. The only jade purity realm practitioner in the Great Sui is an ancestor of the Ge Yang Gao clan, and he’s not skilled in combat but rather a storyteller. He’s long gone to your hometown, the Piyun Mountain. Plus, with that ascendant from Tongyezhou now deceased, his fragmented golden body scattered across Baoping Continent, those qualified to contend for a fight have been reduced to ancient turtles with thousands of years of history, like the Heavenly Lord Qi Zhen of the Divine Revelation Sect, who’s rumored to have surreptitiously stepped into the immortal realm, or the old ancestor of the Jiang clan. Those guys must be busy scheming and battling against each other; otherwise, the remnants, like the Wind and Snow Temple’s Wei Jin, have gathered in the middle of Baoping Continent, preparing to clash with the Heavenly Lord Xie Shi of the North Julu Continent."

Mao Xiaodong lamented, "There are over two hundred kingdoms and vassal states in Baoping Continent, yet there are only a handful of native jade purity realm practitioners—countable on one hand. Before Cui Chan and Qi Jingchun arrived in Baoping, the situation was even more dire; they could be counted on one hand. It’s no wonder practitioners from other continents look down on Baoping; it truly cannot be compared in any aspect. Well, except in martial arts, of course, given the astonishing appearances of Song Changjing and Li Er, who are truly remarkable."

Chen Ping'an shared some anecdotes about the bounties placed on Song Changjing’s head from the Suspended Mountain's Sword Room.

Mao Xiaodong smiled, "The world of righteousness has grown accustomed to looking down on Baoping. When you travel to other continents in the future, if you say you come from the smallest Baoping, you’ll likely be looked down upon often. Speaking of which, do you know what the only significant achievement Qi Jingchun made during those two to three decades when the Cliffside Academy was established was?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "No, I don’t."

Mao Xiaodong smiled, "That was painstakingly cultivating batches of scholarly talent for the Great Li Dynasty, only for each one to sharpen their wits and try to go study at the more prestigious Guanhu Academy. For this, Qi Jingchun didn’t stop them, and the most ridiculous part was that he even had to write recommendation letters for those young scholars, saying good things about them to help them stay at Guanhu Academy."

Chen Ping'an was astonished.

Mao Xiaodong’s expression turned calm. "Back then, in the Great Li Dynasty, almost all scholars believed that the teachings of the sages from your Baoping were inferior, even a gentleman from Guanhu Academy would be held in higher esteem than the head of Cliffside Academy."

The study fell silent for a long time.

Mao Xiaodong turned her gaze to the window, self-mockingly saying, "So from our master, to Qi Jingchun, and finally to me, Mao Xiaodong, it seems no one could ever come to a clear conclusion about who can truly be called a legitimate disciple, how many are truly inner disciples, and who is a genuine closed-door disciple. What do you think, Chen Ping'an? Isn’t it amusing? In contrast, the other major lineages have such orderly and strict transmissions, like a gathering of stars, a glorious spectacle."

Chen Ping'an was at a loss for words, only able to take a sip from his sword-raising gourd.

Mao Xiaodong approached the window, realizing it had become a night of sparse stars and a bright moon.

The tall elder turned his head, seeing the young man who always refused to acknowledge being his junior, hesitating over whether to continue drinking. 

*(End of Chapter)***Chapter 407: Outside the Book**

Before Chen Ping'an accompanied Mao Xiaodong down the mountain to the Confucian Temple in the capital to "try their luck," he first arranged for the personnel inside the academy to avoid any unforeseen opportunities for others to exploit. He didn’t want to fall for a trap that would allow the enemy to execute a diversionary tactic.

He had Pei Qian move out of the guesthouse and into the residence that appreciated their presence, where she would be accompanied by Shi Rou. Chen Ping'an handed over the golden Demon Binding Rope to her.

Lin Shou had been training during the day at the courtyard under Cui Dongshan’s name. With Du Mao's arrival, Lin Shou had discussed it with Chen Ping'an and decided to stay at the courtyard comfortably.

Chen Ping'an then instructed Zhu Lian and Yu Lu to keep a discreet watch over Li Baoping and Li Huai.

Zhu Lian was a hunchbacked old man who grinned at every woman he saw, while Yu Lu was a tall young man who always wore a gentle smile. Who would have thought they were both pure martial artists at the far travel realm?

Li Baoping and Pei Qian stayed together in the main house of Cui Dongshan at night, trusting that Cui wouldn’t have any objections, nor would he dare to.

Xie Xie and Lin Shou each occupied a side room, while Shi Rou, as a spirit being, could take on the role of the night watch. Li Huai shared a room with Lin Shou.

Zhu Lian didn’t need to stay in the courtyard; he could sleep in the original guesthouse at night.

However, Yu Lu had to partner with Shi Rou to guard the place until midnight.

Chen Ping'an had reservations about Shi Rou's ability to handle unexpected situations.

In contrast, Yu Lu had always been a reassuring presence.

Meanwhile, on Mao Xiaodong's side of the academy, among the night-watch scholars, there had always been a distinction between civil and martial roles. The accomplished scholar Dong Jing, who had shown favor toward Lin Shou, was a veteran Golden Core cultivator skilled in lightning techniques. There was also a more unassuming and lesser-known Yuan Ying Earth Immortal from the same region as Mao Xiaodong, an elder named Liang who guarded the academy's entrance. In critical moments, this person could substitute Mao Xiaodong to oversee the academy.

Finally, Chen Ping'an called Li Baoping aside to hand her two items he had acquired from Li Baozhen: a jade pendant inscribed with "Dragon Palace" and a high-ranking talisman known as the "True Body of the Day and Night God."

Li Baoping looked puzzled.

Chen Ping'an didn’t hide anything, briefly explaining his encounter with Li Baozhen in the Kingdom of Qingluan, then gently ruffled Li Baoping’s head and said softly, “In the future, I won’t actively seek out your second brother, and I’ll try to avoid him. However, if Li Baozhen remains stubborn or feels he has been humiliated at Shiziyuan, and conflicts arise again, I won’t hold back. Of course, none of this concerns you.”

Li Baoping looked a bit downcast, but her eyes still sparkled. “Uncle Shi, you should just treat my second brother according to the rules of the Jianghu, clear-cut distinctions between gratitude and grievances…”

She paused and asked, “Uncle Shi, can I write a letter to my elder brother to persuade my second brother to back off?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and nodded, “That’s feasible.”

Just as Li Baoping was about to speak again, preparing to give the jade pendant and talisman back to Chen Ping'an, her little uncle had already mentioned their current situation before descending the mountain.

Li Baoping wanted to ensure her little uncle had a couple more items for protection.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I captured a rare beast that’s practically a living treasure trove with the help of a formidable female sword cultivator at Shiziyuan. The harvest was plentiful; she kept the beast for herself and compensated me with sixty-two Gu Yu coins. So, I want to borrow that talisman from you—not buy it, just a temporary exchange. It’s a bit like a pawnshop; you can consider it a pledge. You give me the talisman, and I’ll give you these Gu Yu coins. This talisman is of high quality and can be reused, unlike one-time consumables. As long as the divine money can support it, the two Day and Night Gods can exist in the world indefinitely. Even if their spiritual forms are broken apart, as long as the person who draws the talisman has the capability to infuse it with life, they can command the two gods to appear. Truth be told, sixty-two Gu Yu coins is quite a sum, but it’s still not enough to purchase such a priceless talisman. So, I’m not buying it…”

After holding back for a while, Li Baoping couldn’t help but say earnestly, “Uncle Shi, you’re making me feel distant; it’s really hurting my feelings.”

Chen Ping'an patiently explained, “Between you, me, and your elder brother, there’s no need for formality, but with the entire Li family of Fulu Street, we still need to maintain some distance. After you pawn the talisman here, those Gu Yu coins can be sent to Longquan County with the help of the Mao Mountain Master. Your grandfather is a Yuan Ying Immortal from our homeland, and he’s likely not lacking in various treasures. After all, we from the Lizhu Cave Heaven are experts at finding bargains, but divine money is something your grandfather surely desires. Although he can sell treasures from his private collection for cash, he’s generally reluctant to part with anything unless it doesn’t align with his own path.”

Li Baoping's face lit up with a smile. “So Uncle Shi was thinking of me all along! I misjudged you; my apologies for being rude!”

With that, Li Baoping started to perform a respectful bow toward Chen Ping'an.

Once Li Baoping stood straight again, Chen Ping'an reached out and pinched her cheek playfully, laughing, “I should take advantage of little Baoping while she’s still little and pinch her cheeks!”

Li Baoping stood motionless, her bright eyes squinting into crescent moons from laughter.

Chen Ping'an watched as Li Baoping dashed away.

She headed toward the academy's main gate, where Mao Xiaodong had been waiting for a while.

After they left the academy and walked through the main street, turning into White Mao Street, Chen Ping'an quietly handed the talisman over to Mao Xiaodong.

Mao Xiaodong glanced at it briefly before tucking it into her sleeve.

The tall old man spoke to Chen Ping'an with ripples of curiosity in his heart lake, “I’ve never seen this talisman before; its material is unusual. What’s the story?”

Chen Ping'an replied in a tone befitting a pure martial artist, “It’s an ancient talisman from the book ‘Dan Shu Zhen Ji,’ called the True Body of the Day and Night God. The essence lies in the ‘true body’ part. The book says it can connect with the deities directly, unlike typical Taoist talismans that rely on a bit of talisman essence to summon spirits, which often lack authenticity. This talisman contains a substantial essence of divinity.”

He then went on to explain the methods of controlling the talisman and the precautions involved.

Mao Xiaodong became increasingly astonished as she listened. “Such a precious talisman, where did you get it?”

Chen Ping'an avoided mentioning his personal grievances with Li Baozhen, simply stating it was a protective talisman entrusted to him for Li Baoping.

Mao Xiaodong smiled and asked, “You’re just handing it over like this?”

Chen Ping'an responded, “Under the Mao Mountain Master's care, it will be put to good use. I’m a martial artist using talismans without knowing the proper methods; I haven’t mastered the authentic techniques of ‘Dan Shu Zhen Ji,’ so it’s easy for me to damage the original essence of the talisman. Any talisman I activate will be akin to fishing in a dried-up pond.”

Mao Xiaodong remarked with a hint of humor, “Well, I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing that firsthand.”

Chen Ping'an was somewhat puzzled.

Mao Xiaodong didn’t elaborate further.

Just as expected of the little apprentice whom Cui Dongshan called the “Wealthy Boy,” always giving gifts and spreading fortune around—wasn’t that a bit excessive?

As they walked down White Mao Street, Chen Ping'an asked, “Isn’t Master Mao concerned about little Baoping skipping classes so much for me?”

Mao Xiaodong replied, “Li Baoping is the one benefiting the most from our academy. As for knowledge, with so many classics from various schools in the Mountain Cliff Academy’s library, reading is a fascinating endeavor. If one isn’t sincere and doesn’t open their mind, the words on the pages will seem delicate and haughty, refusing to grow legs and walk into the minds of readers. Li Baoping, however, is exceptional; the principles articulated in the texts not only take root in her mind but also return to the world, flying out to help those in need. It may seem trivial, but it’s truly remarkable. Haven’t our Confucian ancestors pursued this all along? The three unworldly legacies of reading—words, deeds, and virtue—are often coveted by people, yet they overlook the fundamental concept of ‘establishing’ itself. What does it mean to stand firm and upright? That requires profound understanding.”

Mao Xiaodong put her hands behind her back and looked up at the sky above the capital. “Chen Ping'an, you’ve missed out on a lot of beautiful sights. Every time little Baoping goes out to play, I secretly follow her. Ever since that spirited little girl in red appeared in this grand Sui capital, it feels as though it has… come to life.”

Mao Xiaodong’s sentimentality brought a smile to Chen Ping'an’s face, feeling delighted for little Baoping’s accomplishments in her studies.

Suddenly, Mao Xiaodong said, “Now that you’re reading both Confucian and Legalist texts, I need to remind you—if you mix and match Confucian teachings without mastering them, you’ll end up in a muddle, as though everything can be found in the texts, leading to confusion, especially when faced with significant moral dilemmas. But you should also consider, why has no ruler in history ever openly advocated for Legalism?”

Before Chen Ping'an could respond, Mao Xiaodong waved her hand dismissively. “You underestimate the breadth of the Confucian sages, and you also undervalue the strength of the Legalist masters.”

Mao Xiaodong sighed softly, “Do you know how the sages view the highs and lows of different schools of thought?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “I certainly don’t know.”

He instinctively pulled out his wine gourd, thinking that the Mao Mountain Master’s heartfelt words would pair excellently with the drink, leaving a lasting flavor in Chen Ping'an’s memory.

Mao Xiaodong pointed toward the bustling street filled with people, casually gesturing as she smiled, “To put it simply, Confucianism brings people together, while Legalism drives people apart.”

Chen Ping'an pondered this thoughtfully.

Mao Xiaodong added, “This is just my perspective; it may not be accurate. Take it if you find it useful, consider it a side dish for your wine, but if not, just forget it. There are so many wise sayings in books, yet I’ve never seen the world value or fully grasp them. My understanding of knowledge is truly limited.”

Chen Ping'an sipped his wine, remaining silent.

After a moment of silence, Mao Xiaodong gazed at the endless stream of people on the streets of the capital and unexpectedly recalled a certain impudent remark from a little rascal: “It is often the beautiful mistakes, extreme thoughts, and a few unavoidable coincidences that drive history forward.”

Mao Xiaodong’s thoughts drifted away, and when she came back to herself, she still hadn’t heard Chen Ping'an speak. The old man turned in surprise and said, “Shouldn’t you say a few polite words about how great the Mao Mountain Master’s knowledge is and not belittle yourself?”

Chen Ping'an was left speechless.

Mr. Qi, the Sword Immortal, Cui Zhan.

Then there was this tall old man beside him.

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but feel that the disciples taught by the Sage of Literature varied greatly in their talents.

But then he thought back to his own “disciples” Cui Dongshan and Pei Qian, who seemed to be in a similar situation.

If possible, adding Cao Qinglang from the Lotus Blossom Blessed Land later would only further showcase their differences.

He remembered reading a book on elementary learning that stated, “The blossoming of a hundred flowers signifies spring.”

That made sense.

---

As twilight descended, Chen Ping'an and Mao Xiaodong had yet to return to the academy.

At Cui Dongshan’s courtyard, it was the first time it was bustling with activity.

Li Baoping, Li Huai, Lin Shou, Yu Lu, and Xie Xie.

Along with Pei Qian and Shi Rou.

Lin Shou and Xie Xie sat at either end of the Green Bamboo Corridor at Qingxiao Crossing, each practicing their breathing techniques.

Shi Rou felt constrained; she sensed she had no place in the academy, and in this courtyard, she felt even more uneasy.

Chen Ping'an had briefly mentioned the backgrounds and powers of Li Huai and the others.

Li Baoping’s second brother, Li Baozhen, was someone Shi Rou had encountered, a person of significant cunning.

Li Huai’s father was said to be a Tenth Realm martial artist who had nearly killed the Great Li’s vassal king, Song Changjing, and who single-handedly climbed the mountain to dismantle the Hall of the Ancestor of Tongye Sect.

Chen Ping'an had never mentioned Yu Lu’s identity, but Shi Rou already knew this tall young scholar was a pure martial artist at the Eighth Realm.

Xie Xie’s current identity was said to be Cui Dongshan’s maid, while Shi Rou was aware that Xie Xie had once been a talented cultivator in a great dynasty.

Shi Rou stood at the courtyard’s entrance, intentionally keeping her distance from everyone.

She understood that these individuals were all here for the first time to study in the Great Sui, and along the way, it was all Chen Ping'an’s arrangements. According to conversations she heard between Chen Ping'an and Pei Qian and Zhu Lian, Chen Ping'an had only been a Second or Third Realm martial artist at that time?

Why did these figures, who would be considered extraordinary in any great dynasty, seem to regard Chen Ping'an, an outsider new to the academy, as if his arrangements were entirely natural and even inevitable?

Li Baoping was copying texts in Cui Dongshan’s small study.

Pei Qian and Li Huai lay on the green bamboo floor at the main house’s doorway, pulling out Cui Dongshan’s beloved chessboard and pieces, starting to play Gobang.

The rules were the same as the ones Cui Dongshan had once played with Pei Qian, which had led to her losing miserably.

Yu Lu sat cross-legged between the two, and Pei Qian and Li Huai had agreed that each could ask Yu Lu for assistance three times.

Yu Lu, acting as a dog-headed military advisor while straddling two boats, was far more focused than the frequently bickering Pei Qian and Li Huai.

Shi Rou felt like an outsider.

Yet she was clearly a master of the remnants of a celestial being, with a promising path ahead, possibly achieving greater heights than anyone in the courtyard.

Shouldn’t she be worshipped at any sect gate on Baoping Continent?

Here, while everyone was polite to her, it was only that; the politeness was laced with an unmistakable distance and coldness.

Shi Rou couldn’t make sense of it.

---

The Cai family finally ushered their troublesome old ancestor out the door.

From Cai Jing to the cook in the kitchen, everyone felt a tremendous relief.

Perhaps the only ones slightly disappointed were the beautiful maidens who had the opportunity to serve the handsome immortal.

Cui Dongshan had left the state capital but didn’t head straight for the capital city. Instead, he resided in a large Daoist temple in the suburbs.

An elderly Daoist priest, who hosted rituals and guided people into the Dao, thus bore the title of “Master” on the Daoist records, visited in the name of discussing Daoist profundities.

Wei Xian understood that the old Daoist was undoubtedly a spy from Great Li embedded within the Great Sui.

This wasn’t surprising; when Cui Dongshan had some free time, he had shown Wei Xian a list of the assassins and spies that were still lurking throughout Great Li, hidden among various sects and professions, with many more who had yet to be uncovered. Many names circled in red ink were those who sold intelligence, two-faced spies who were the most interesting, as they recognized no kinship, only valuing money, making dealings with them quite stimulating.

However, much to Wei Xian’s surprise, after the old Daoist briefly delivered a piece of intelligence, he actually sat down on a cushion across from Cui Dongshan and began discussing various matters.

Wei Xian nearly dozed off.

After the old Daoist left, Cui Dongshan pointed to the cushion opposite him and said, “While it’s warm, hurry and sit down.”

Though Wei Xian sat down, he chose to sit on the ground instead of the cushion.

Cui Dongshan retrieved a small ornate table from nearby, filled with writing tools, and spread out a sheet of exquisite paper, likely made for imperial use, and began to write.

Wei Xian asked, “Why did Mr. Cui suddenly change his mind, leaving the Cai family and rushing toward the capital only to stop here?”

This was a question Wei Xian found perplexing.

Cui Dongshan didn’t look up or answer, instead digressing, “Do you think the human heart is complex?”

Wei Xian nodded, “Naturally.”

Cui Dongshan was recognized as a master calligrapher in Central Earth, and even from a distance, Wei Xian found the flow of his brushwork pleasing to the eye.

Cui Dongshan continued writing the summary of intelligence reports, slowly saying, “The human heart appears unpredictable. In reality, it’s far less complicated than you think. Everyone fears death, which is human nature, akin to the essence of all living beings. What sets us apart from beasts is our emotional ties, familial bonds, and concern for the rise and fall of our country. Am I right? The more exceptional a person is, the more pronounced these feelings become.”

Wei Xian pondered, “That’s true, but there are also those who maintain a muddled balance.”

Cui Dongshan stopped writing, placing his brush on the ceramic holder, shaking out his wrist with a sneer, “What balance? That’s just a muddled fool, indecisive, drifting with the current, wanting beauty when they see a gorgeous person and desiring wealth and fame. They want it all, but it’s a different story if they don’t recognize their limitations. Liu Qingfeng, Li Baozhen, Wei Li, and Wu Yuan are all clever people, yet they have their own flaws and shortcomings. Wu Yuan, the governor of Longquan County, personally identifies with my theories on achievements. He’s also my nominal disciple, but because he received kindness early on from that nun who practices in Changchun Palace, he believes everything he has today is a reward from her. Thus, he wavers between personal favor and national affairs, living a conflicted life.”

“Li Baozhen’s pursuits aren’t particularly strange, nor does he align with Wu Yuan’s orthodox Confucianism; he simply seeks achievements, aspiring to one day hold the highest rank under the emperor. But he is wise yet foolish, as he doesn’t yet understand that he’s only playing the fool. In the world, what’s considered cleverness is worthless.”

“Wei Li from Huangting Country is, relatively speaking, the most scholarly among the four, who values the country and the people above all else. However, his perspective remains narrow; he sees only the realm of a nation and the customs of a hundred years, and hasn’t yet learned to look beyond to the whole continent and the plans of a thousand years.”

“The county magistrate of the small Qingluan Kingdom, Liu Qingfeng, is the one I have the most hope for among the four. Unfortunately, he lacks the aptitude for cultivation; he’s destined for a maximum of a hundred years of life. Truly… is it that heaven is jealous of talented people?”

Wei Xian was somewhat surprised to hear this.

Mr. Cui actually chose to describe others as “talented”?

Wei Xian had been chewing over Cui Dongshan’s understanding of human nature in his mind.

Cui Dongshan picked up a pile of intelligence reports that had been deemed less significant and tossed them to Wei Xian. “Here are the latest failed poems from the candidates of Great Li and Great Sui’s imperial examinations. I use them to pass time when I’m bored.”

Wei Xian caught them, and Cui Dongshan continued, “You might be wondering how I assess the depths and directions of human hearts. It seems feasible, but in reality, the world is unpredictable. The fluctuations of human hearts can change with a single event, which remains a great hassle and is extremely difficult to be precise about. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as genuine knowledge, right?”

Wei Xian nodded, not denying it.

Cui Dongshan laughed, pointing at his own head, “When you ascend the mountain to cultivate, aside from longevity, your mind will also grow clearer.”

Cui Dongshan then flicked his wrist and scattered a handful of divine money across the table, “The classifications of human hearts I mentioned can be supplemented with the counting techniques from the various schools of thought. You can rank them from one to ten, and you’ll find that those fluctuations in human hearts won’t affect the final outcome.”

Before Wei Xian could speak, Cui Dongshan laughed, “One to ten still isn’t accurate. But what if you could refine it to one hundred?”

Wei Xian sighed, “This technique has long been regarded as a minor path in the world of Haoran, often only praised by merchants who don’t have a particularly good reputation. Can you really use it like this? Are you suggesting that aside from Confucianism and Legalism, you also admire the techniques of numerology?”

Cui Dongshan scoffed, “Do I need to admire the techniques of numerology?”

Cui Dongshan stood up, “I delve into the distinctions of divine beings, the three souls and six spirits, and the world’s minutiae. A small numerologist is nothing.”

Wei Xian held the stack of papers filled with failed poems from the two countries’ scholars, left speechless.

Cui Dongshan finally circled back to Wei Xian’s initial question, “I have a clear understanding of everything inside and outside the academy. The only variable now is that Zhao Scholar, who is as harmless as a chicken.”

Wei Xian asked, puzzled, “An elderly scholar, a Confucian sage in charge of a small academy, can he really stir up trouble? Besides, according to your explanation, the emperor of Great Sui wouldn’t dare to act against Li Baoping and Li Huai unless he wanted to bring about his own downfall.”

Cui Dongshan stared at Wei Xian with a look of disdain, “Think carefully. I reminded you before; look at the issue from a higher perspective.”

Wei Xian’s heart jolted.

Cui Dongshan rubbed his face, sneering, “Does the emperor of Great Sui care about national fate? The people behind the scenes wouldn’t care whether Great Li and Great Sui fight to the death, taking down both sides. If assassination of one or two people could determine the direction of a continent, would you, Wei Xian, not be tempted? Merchants would welcome it, as wars bring wealth and profits. Those who enjoy playing cunningly behind the scenes would be even more ecstatic!”

Wei Xian’s emotions surged, his hands trembling slightly.

This was the true vision of the emperor of the Southern Yuan!

A time of great chaos and contention!

All the emperors, generals, and immortal masters—everyone would be swept up in the torrent of fate, mere pawns in an unstoppable game.

Yet, it seemed Cui Dongshan recalled some sorrowful memory, wiping his face, “Look at me, with such great abilities and knowledge, what am I doing now? Calculating this and that, it’s just a trivial matter. The old bastard is happily plotting to seize the entire Baoping Continent while I can only guard this place and watch over Great Sui, making a small living here. I have a small business, merely floundering around. I still have to worry that one mishap will lead to my expulsion from the master’s door…”

Cui Dongshan clenched his fist and pounded it heavily against his chest, “Old Wei, it pains my heart.”

Then Wei Xian looked at the young man in white rolling around on the floor of the room, glancing down at the papers containing those failed poems that revealed true emotions.

He wasn’t heartbroken; he was just exhausted.

---

The Great Sui’s Gao family treated scholars well; this had been a tradition since the founding of the dynasty.

Not to mention someone like Zhang Dai, a newly minted top scholar, who, although temporarily still at the Hanlin Academy, had already acquired a ten-room courtyard in the capital, funded by the Ministry of Revenue.

That evening, Zhang Dai strolled through the empty courtyard, having fed the few red carp in the large vat, before entering the study to compose music alone.

Zhang Dai hailed from a humble family in the countryside. His essays for the county and township examinations were commendable, but nothing spectacular; it was only during the palace examination that he made a stunning impression, enabling him to leap into the dragon’s gate.

After becoming the top scholar, he moved into this courtyard. The only change was that he hired a coachman and a horse-drawn carriage. Aside from that, Zhang Dai didn’t engage in many social gatherings or banquets. It was hard to imagine this young man in his early twenties, the new literary champion of Great Sui, could be seen at the Cai family’s residence, speaking generously, and even sharing a carriage with the military general Miao Ren, a reward for his contributions in founding the dynasty.

Both Cai Feng and Miao Ren considered this entirely reasonable, believing that Zhang Dai, with his valuable title as top scholar, was a reputable figure known throughout the court and the world, possessing a humble yet honest background, filled with youthful passion, thus easy to manage, willing to put himself forward for the sake of the country.

When Zhang Dai heard the knocking at the door, he paused his game of Go, looked up, and said, “Come in.”

It was the old coachman staying in the courtyard.

The elder stood at the slightly dim doorway of the study and said slowly, “Mao Xiaodong has taken a young man named Chen Ping'an away from the academy.”

“Aren’t they shouting about killing the literary demon Mao Xiaodong? They should just go ahead and do it.”

Zhang Dai replied expressionlessly, “You should find a reason for the insiders in the academy to let Zhao Shi and Bai Lu leave together. Have them find a secluded place to knock him out and hide him. Once they’ve got hold of that Bai Lu, be sure not to raise the suspicions of the Yuan Ying cultivator Liang Ren Si on guard. As long as you can smoothly enter the academy and act decisively, it’s best if one dies; if two die, even better.”

The elder nodded.

Zhang Dai hesitated for a moment, “I’ll be leaving the Great Sui capital tonight.”

The elder smiled, “If this task is accomplished, once you return to Central Earth, you will surely soar to great heights.”

Zhang Dai said nothing.

After the elder left.

Zhang Dai put down his go board and looked down at the game.

It was a complex interplay of strategy.

---

In the southeastern part of Baoping Continent, on the outskirts of the capital of the Qingluan Kingdom, there was a discreet private residence.

The young man, one of the leaders of the Great Li Green Wave Pavilion’s spies, wore a gloomy expression.

The people in the hall had varied identities, all skilled scribes in the Qingluan Kingdom’s political and literary circles, and were, of course, loyalists of the Great Li dynasty.

Li Baozhen stared at the ground, spinning a teacup he hadn’t even taken a sip from.

Everyone was apprehensive.

They had gathered here to carry out a singular task.

To drag the venerable old scholar Liu Jingting, the literary leader of the Qingluan Kingdom, who had withdrawn to Shiziyuan, into the mud with their pens, ensuring he would never recover, thus shattering the cohesion of those fleeing scholars from the south. The Qingluan Kingdom still needed a flourishing scholarly community, but it didn't require a singular figure like Liu Jingting.

As long as Liu Jingting’s reputation was ruined, the clothing-clad clans would fall apart.

The Great Li dynasty would welcome this scene, and even the emperor of the Qingluan Kingdom would see the pros and cons, ensuring they wouldn’t be restrained by those outsiders who couldn’t discern the situation, meddling in the Qingluan Kingdom’s governance, bringing criticism to the day-to-day affairs. At that time, the Tang emperor could sit down with Great Li and divide the spoils, pulling in those influential clans.

However, this night, the dozen or so individuals present had mobilized all their backgrounds and influence to attack Liu Jingting, thoroughly dissecting every piece of his writings—poems, essays, official documents—searching for flaws word by word.

To their surprise, not only did they see little effect, but it also sparked the outrage of most scholars in the Qingluan Kingdom. Some officials who originally disagreed with Liu Jingting’s political views and many local scholars couldn’t bear to see it and began to speak up for him. Especially those clans from the south who had fled here were outraged, rallying to defend Liu Jingting, to the point where rumors of his impending return to the central court as the Minister of Rites began to circulate in the capital.

Li Baozhen raised his head and smiled, “Everyone need not be nervous. If this matter doesn’t go well, and instead of a red light, we end up with a smear, the first to face the knife will be me, Li Baozhen, followed by you all. If the national teacher can understand, perhaps he will find our actions justifiable and give us another chance at the chessboard.”

Not saying such “consoling words” would have been better; once Li Baozhen said this, everyone felt a chill run down their spines.

A shiver ran through them.

The candlelight in the hall flickered.

Li Baozhen was undoubtedly furious, surrounded by a bunch of incompetent fools!

At that moment, two figures appeared in the hall; one entered, while the other remained outside.

Upon seeing the scholar in robes who walked into the hall, Li Baozhen felt somewhat helpless, thinking he could avoid this person and manage to make this matter splendidly, but he never expected it to turn out like this.

The man spoke softly, “Everyone present has already accomplished half the task; there are still three small steps to take.”

“The first step is to halt the slandering attacks on Liu Jingting, turning around to lavish praise on the old scholar. This step has three parts: first, you all and your friends should put out some balanced and dignified articles to conclude this matter, ensuring that your own writings retain some persuasiveness. Second, start inviting another group of people to deify Liu Jingting, the more flattering the language, the better. Praise his moral essays to the point that he could accompany the sages in the Confucian Temple after his death. Third, create another set of articles attacking all the officials and literati who have defended Liu Jingting, regardless of the context. The more malicious the wording, the better, but be sure that the overall intention of these articles must portray everyone as Liu Jingting’s sycophants, likening them to lackeys.”

Initially, the crowd in the hall felt amused and scornful at the first sentence of the man.

But as they listened further, they began to feel… this was a novel approach!

The man continued, “The second step is to wait for a period, then redirect the attacks squarely at Liu Jingting. This requires some finesse; all articles should hinge on phrases like ‘although’ and ‘even if,’ for example: ‘Although Liu Jingting has some moral shortcomings, these flaws do not detract from his talents, and many outstanding individuals have emerged from his tutelage,’ then you can list them one by one, aiming for those prominent officials that evoke envy. Or say, ‘Even if Liu Jingting’s accomplishments are mediocre, he is still regarded as honest and merely a well-known figure in the half-continent, Lion Park.’”

The man explained, “Why do it this way? Because for onlookers, these articles appear calm and are ostensibly defending Liu Jingting. Many who were originally neutral and uninvolved in this literary battle will unconsciously begin to accept these hypothetical truths, and when paired with the hidden malice of supposed defenses, it becomes a snowball effect.”

The crowd in the hall exchanged glances.

The man smiled, “The third step involves making personal attacks on his moral character. For instance, hire someone to write, without concern for their writing skills; all that matters is the sensationalism. For example, stories about Liu Jingting spending stormy nights in a nunnery, or old tales of infidelity, or the scandal of Lion Park and a beautiful maid, coupled with some catchy doggerel to create a storytelling narrative, and ask storytellers and wandering folk to spread it widely.”

Seeing the crowd both shocked and confused, the man patiently explained, “Don’t underestimate this; down-and-out scholars without fame love these tales, and the common folk who care little for the truth enjoy hearing such things. In the scholarly community, three becomes a tiger. In the market, a swarm of mosquitoes becomes thunder.”

The man finally smiled, producing a piece of paper and walking over to Li Baozhen, handing it over while surveying the room. “Everyone may not know the routes, prices, and the amount of silver needed to publish an explicit book. I’ve written all these trivial matters down on this paper, to prevent you from becoming unwitting victims. Moreover, many cunning merchants, despite their lowly status, possess their own ways of navigating the world. If they feel they’ve been taken advantage of financially, they might even look down on you.”

With that, the man took his leave.

As he approached the door, he suddenly turned around and smiled, “You all have set the stage for me to showcase my modest skills. I hope this can be of some help.”

Everyone stood there, dumbfounded, watching him leave.

Li Baozhen felt dry-mouthed, tightly gripping the piece of paper in his hand.

The rest felt even more rattled.

They knew the man was named Liu Qingfeng.

He was none other than Liu Jingting’s eldest son.

**(End of Chapter)****Chapter 408: Visitors with Malicious Intent**

To obtain a portion of literary fortune from the Wen Temple in the capital of the Great Sui, Chen Ping'an's cultivation path was at stake, yet Mao Xiaodong did not rush him directly there. Instead, they strolled leisurely, engaging in casual conversation.

Along the way, Mao Xiaodong inquired about Chen Ping'an's adventures, curious about the many tales he had gathered. Chen Ping'an had traveled far twice, but most of his experiences were in dense mountains and by rivers, where he encountered few literary and martial temples. He soon began to reminisce about his seemingly rugged yet exceptionally talented friend, the bearded hero Xu Yuanxia.

This man, who had left the army years ago, not only recorded the landscapes of various regions but also painted intricate depictions of ancient wooden structures from different countries. Mao Xiaodong suggested that Xu could serve as an honorary teacher at the academy, offering lectures to the students about the grand mountains and beautiful rivers. The academy could even set aside a room to display his meticulously crafted paintings.

Chen Ping'an agreed to send a letter to Xu Yuanxia, who had returned to his homeland, inviting him to visit the Cliffside Academy of the Great Sui.

The most grand and ceremonious Wen Temple of the Great Sui was located to the northwest. Therefore, as they departed from Donghua Mountain, they traversed through half the capital. During this journey, Mao Xiaodong treated Chen Ping'an to lunch at a small restaurant tucked away in a narrow alleyway, which, despite its humble location, was bustling with patrons. The homemade rice wine was particularly noteworthy.

Mao Xiaodong explained that each time they brewed the wine, the owner carefully selected glutinous rice and would take his son out of the city to fetch water from Songfeng Spring, sixty miles away. The father and son took turns carrying the heavy load, returning home just as the day ended, which led to the creation of this exquisite rice wine that the capital's drinkers couldn't resist.

As Chen Ping'an left the restaurant, he purchased a large vat of rice wine. When they reached a secluded alley, he carefully poured the remaining wine into his nearly empty Sword Nourishing Gourd and stored the empty vat among his other belongings.

Within those belongings was a plethora of oddities.

Clothing and books, scholarly supplies, pots and pans, firewood and needles, herbs and firestones, all jumbled together.

Noticing Chen Ping'an putting away the worthless empty wine vat, Mao Xiaodong reminded him, "Little by little, a lot can be amassed. However, don't get caught up in the minor details, nitpicking everything. Otherwise, your mind will be clouded and weary, even if your body remains strong."

Chen Ping'an smiled. "Got it."

Mao Xiaodong chuckled, stroking his beard.

In truth, it was he, the elder Mao, who was being overly critical. But how else could he assert his authority as a senior brother if he didn’t play around with Chen Ping'an a little? If their master didn’t berate him, shouldn’t he at least find some way to reclaim his dignity through Chen Ping'an?

After nearly half an hour of walking, they reached the revered Wen Temple, a sacred site in the hearts of all scholars in the Great Sui.

Wen Temples were scattered throughout the vast expanse of the world, like beacons of literary fortune lighting up the earth.

Except in the most remote areas, even the smallest counties were expected to establish both literary and martial temples. Every newly appointed county magistrate needed to pay their respects at the Wen Temple before honoring the spirits at the martial temple.

Thus, even in that small town where Chen Ping'an grew up, which had been isolated and neglected, the first major task after the Great Li imperial court established authority was to have the first county magistrate, Wu Yuan, immediately begin preparations for the location of the Wen and Wu Temples.

Standing outside the Wen Temple, Mao Xiaodong and Chen Ping'an stood side by side.

Mao Xiaodong asked, "Now that we've had rice wine and are here at the Wen Temple, do you have any insights?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "From the fine glutinous rice used to brew the wine, and with so many people buying it, it shows that the citizens of the capital are not only well-fed but also have spare money. As for this Wen Temple, I haven’t noticed anything yet."

Having answered only partially, Chen Ping'an elicited a nod from Mao Xiaodong. But this time, he genuinely wasn’t trying to be cryptic; he pointed out, "The lack of any movement over there suggests that those residing in the mud bricks of the Great Sui’s Wen Temple do not look favorably upon your literary fortune, Chen Ping'an."

With a hint of derision, Mao Xiaodong continued, "Perhaps they've been exposed to incense for hundreds of years and have dulled their senses."

He elaborated, "Scholars visiting the Wen Temple with sincere thoughts, if they possess great literary fortune, would be sensed by the deities there, who might secretly bestow upon them a bit of enhanced literary talent. What the world calls 'writing like a god' is based on this principle. However, what the sages of the Wen Temple can do is only to add embellishments; in the end, it still depends on the scholar's own diligence."

"Those who are willing to perform these small gestures are mostly the incense spirits of our country's literary officials who have ascended to godhood. The Wen Temples in various capitals merely house clay statues of the greatest sages and the accompanying seventy-two worthies. Of course, there are a few exceptions; among the nine great dynasties, it is common to find a grand sage presiding over the Wen Temple."

Upon hearing this, Chen Ping'an gently asked, "Is it true that the southern part of Baoping Continent is saying that the Great Li has become the tenth dynasty?"

Mao Xiaodong laughed, "After the Great Li's new Five Sacred Mountains all appear, then we can talk about that. Right now, we have only one North Sacred Mountain, the Piling Mountain, which still seems legitimate; it's a bit too early."

Mao Xiaodong moved forward. "Come on, let's go meet the sages of the Wen Temple, the essence of the Great Sui’s national character."

Chen Ping'an followed closely behind.

The Wen Temple was vast, teeming with scholars and devotees, yet it did not feel crowded.

However, when Chen Ping'an arrived with Mao Xiaodong at the main hall of the Wen Temple, he found it completely deserted.

It seemed the temple’s custodian had received orders to keep tourists and worshippers away from the main hall, where offerings were made to the world, while the back hall was dedicated to the nation's sages.

The courtyard was silent, ancient trees towering overhead.

An elderly Confucian scholar, dressed in flowing robes and a tall cap, with a long sword hanging at his waist, emerged from behind a clay statue. He stepped over the threshold and walked into the courtyard.

Mao Xiaodong exchanged bows with this renowned civil minister of the Great Sui, known for his literary prowess.

Before entering the courtyard, Mao Xiaodong had already told Chen Ping'an about several 'living' deities of the Wen Temple, recounting their lives, their literary connections, and their remarkable achievements in their respective dynasties.

The deity before them was named Yuan Gaofeng, one of the founding figures of the Great Sui. He was a martial scholar with numerous military accomplishments, who had abandoned his pen for the sword. He fought alongside the founding emperor, Gao Yang, and helped carve out the empire. Afterward, he served as the Minister of Personnel and was granted the title of Grand Scholar of Wuying Hall, demonstrating great diligence and achieving remarkable political results, earning the posthumous title of Wen Zheng. The Yuan family remains one of the foremost aristocratic clans of the Great Sui, with many talented descendants. The current head of the Yuan family had once served as the Minister of Justice but resigned due to illness. Many of his descendants have made significant contributions in the officialdom, battlefield, and scholarly pursuits.

Yuan Gaofeng was also the first official since the founding of the Great Sui to be posthumously honored with the title Wen Zheng by the emperor.

He asked, "What brings you, Master Mao, to this place?"

Mao Xiaodong countered, "Are you feigning ignorance?"

Yuan Gaofeng maintained his expression, "Please, Master Mao, speak plainly."

Mao Xiaodong slowly said, "I wish to take a portion of literary fortune from your Wen Temple and borrow some items. I generally need to take away the zither and a set of chimes, along with one each of the ceremonial vessels, a candelabrum, and the large blue-and-white jar that you later moved from the local Wen Temple, funded by the historian Yan Qingguang. This is a borrowing for our Cliffside Academy. Of course, I will return the items without fail along with their literary fortune."

Yuan Gaofeng inquired, "Why not just take them by force?"

Indeed, as a scholar, he was straightforward and unambiguous.

Mao Xiaodong chuckled, "If I could take them, I wouldn’t bother being polite."

Yuan Gaofeng mocked, "So you do know! Listening to your bold words, I almost believed you, Mao Xiaodong, had already become a sage of the Jade Purity realm."

Yuan Gaofeng then added, "But the Jade Purity realm doesn’t seem sufficient. Unless you can move the entire Donghua Mountain here to the Wen Temple, you might as well forget it, right? Insufficient realm is one challenge; using the divine powers of immortals to move mountains is a whole different level of difficulty. It truly tests your capabilities, Master Mao."

Mao Xiaodong looked around and chuckled, "How could I move it? The mountain is bigger than the temple. Should I just drop it down to cover the Wen Temple? Wouldn't the Great Sui's premier Wen Temple be ruined in an instant?"

Yuan Gaofeng's expression grew stern. "Mao Xiaodong, stop playing your commercial tricks here. You want me, Yuan Gaofeng, to bargain with you? You may have no shame, but I fear it would tarnish the scholarly reputation! You know the bottom line of the Wen Temple!"

Unfazed, Mao Xiaodong continued his casual demeanor.

However, Chen Ping'an felt a surge of overwhelming righteous energy, and faintly, colorful lights appeared, swirling and dancing as if they were solidifying.

The true energy within Chen Ping'an stagnated and circulated, nurturing the water-themed life essence of his Water Character Seal, leaving him with no choice but to tightly close the door, making the little green-clothed children born from the essence of the water flow tremble in fear.

Mao Xiaodong did not intervene to stop Yuan Gaofeng's intentional display of power, allowing Chen Ping'an to shoulder the weight of the intense literary fortune alone.

Mao Xiaodong raised his hand, pointing toward the main hall. "Let's discuss this in the back hall."

Yuan Gaofeng hesitated briefly before agreeing.

Mao Xiaodong instructed Chen Ping'an to explore the front hall, while he would handle matters in the back hall.

As Mao Xiaodong and Yuan Gaofeng stepped into the back hall, several more golden-bodied deities emerged from their clay statues.

Chen Ping'an strolled slowly through the solemn main hall, marking this as his first time entering the main hall of a national Wen Temple. Previously, during his time in Tongye Continent, he had not followed the Yao clan to the Mirage City of the Daqin Dynasty. Had he done so, he would have certainly visited. Later, in the capital of Qingluan Kingdom, due to the prevailing debates between Buddhism and Daoism at the time, he missed the opportunity. As for the capital of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, there was no Wen Temple dedicated to the seventy-two worthies.

No matter how far he traveled or how closely he observed, one could not capture every view perfectly; there would always be missed details.

Time flowed on, inching toward dusk. Alone, Chen Ping'an moved with barely a sound, having already examined the main hall's statues twice. Earlier, in the "Shan Hai Zhi," a book on immortals, he had encountered brief notes and travelogues about these accompanying 'worthies' of the Wen Temple. This perplexity was part of the Confucian tradition that the common people found hard to grasp. Even the heads of the seventy-two academies were habitually referred to as sages. Why were these eminent figures with substantial knowledge and virtue merely labeled as 'worthies' by Confucian orthodoxy? After all, there were far more worthies than there were true gentlemen in the major academies.

Mao Xiaodong returned from the back hall, and Chen Ping'an noticed that the elder's expression was not very pleasant.

Since they were in the Wen Temple, Chen Ping'an refrained from asking too many questions.

Once outside the Wen Temple, Mao Xiaodong took the initiative to speak, "Every one of them is as stingy as a miser, making it hard to negotiate."

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement.

Mao Xiaodong looked up at the sky. "Having visited the Wen Temple amidst great propriety, we should have dinner soon. After that, we can take advantage of the darkness to visit a few other places where literary fortune gathers. We won't dawdle on the road; we should act swiftly and strive to return to the academy before dawn. As for the Wen Temple, we certainly cannot let them continue being so stingy. We will come here every day from now on."

After crossing two busy streets, they found a nearby tavern. While waiting for their food to arrive, Mao Xiaodong, using his inner voice, informed Chen Ping'an, "The atmosphere at the Wen Temple feels off. I can understand Yuan Gaofeng being unyielding, but the other two Great Sui sages who supported him today are known for their gentle temperaments; they shouldn’t be so stubborn."

Chen Ping'an poured two bowls of rice wine from his Sword Nourishing Gourd and asked, "Could it be that Yuan Gaofeng is actually trying to warn us through such methods? The deities of the Wen Temple must have already noticed the undercurrents in the Great Sui. Yet, being caught between the high family lineage and literary fortune, they find it hard to make a decision and can only watch from the sidelines. Yet they also don’t want to see us remain in the dark and jeopardize the literary tradition of Donghua Mountain Academy. So they deliberately put on a stern face, acting against reason to alert us to be cautious about the situation outside the Wen Temple?"

Mao Xiaodong smiled, somewhat reassured. "Correct."

Looking out at the tavern's window, he remarked, "I thought our bait would entice them to observe a bit longer, or perhaps send some small fry to nibble at it during the quiet of the night. I didn’t expect that even before dark, just a stone's throw from the Wen Temple, the streets bustling with people, they’ve already unleashed their trump card. When did the Great Sui’s literati become so ruthless?"

Chen Ping'an took a leisurely sip of the fragrant rice wine.

Mao Xiaodong laughed and asked, "Aren’t you nervous at all?"

Chen Ping'an set down his wine bowl and replied, "To be honest with you, Master Mao, I’ve seen quite a bit of bloodshed myself."

Mao Xiaodong raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What sort of experiences?"

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and candidly said, "I’ve battled a Yuan Ying-level old dragon at Jiao Long Gou, carried the sword of the great sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall, and endured a strike from an ascendant's life-bound magical artifact, the Sword Swallowing Boat."

Mao Xiaodong burst into hearty laughter.

Holding back his own chuckle, Chen Ping'an added a complimentary remark, "And I’ve had the honor of sharing a drink with Master Mao."

Mao Xiaodong quickly lifted his large white bowl, saying, "Forget about the past; let’s drink to the present."

After finishing his bowl, Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, "Can we scout out the approximate number and strength of our opponents?"

Mao Xiaodong nodded. "These past few years, while seemingly idling around with the little Baoping, I’ve actually been scheming to accomplish something significant. What that is shall remain unspoken for now, but within a thousand feet radius around me, I’m well aware of all Qi practitioners below the fifth realm and all martial artists below the ninth realm. As for those five assassins, there’s one ninth-realm Golden Core swordsman, one Dragon Gate realm warrior, one Dragon Gate realm formation master, one Wandering realm martial artist, and one Golden Body realm martial artist."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "I may not be able to help much."

Mao Xiaodong stood up with a smile and retrieved the Day and Night Traveling Spirit Talisman from his sleeve, handing it back to Chen Ping'an. He communicated with his mind, "A senior brother shouldn’t squander his junior brother's possessions. Keep it."

Chen Ping'an hesitated.

Mao Xiaodong laughed and asked, "What’s wrong? Do you think the enemies are too formidable, and that I, Mao Xiaodong, am overly confident? Have you forgotten what I said before? As long as there are no Jade Purity realm cultivators supporting them, I can handle them all."

Chen Ping'an frowned, "What if there is one?"

Mao Xiaodong chuckled, "Then I’d be even more at ease. Their presence here would indicate that there are no hidden traps or lethal moves laid for us at the academy."

Taking advantage of Mao Xiaodong's temporary lack of action, Chen Ping'an silently poured himself another bowl of wine.

Mao Xiaodong, curious, asked, "What are you doing?"

Chen Ping'an, with his head down, took a hearty drink. "Just following that Zhu Lian, drinking punishment wine."

Mao Xiaodong chuckled and scolded, "You little rascal, you’re just waiting for a Jade Purity realm cultivator to show up, aren’t you?!"

Chen Ping'an merely smiled faintly.

Mao Xiaodong glanced at the jade hairpin and remained silent.

*(End of Chapter)*### Chapter 409: Swordsmanship

It was strange. Although Mao Xiaodong had already departed, the main hall of the Confucian Temple remained closed to the public, exuding an atmosphere of martial law.

In the rear hall, besides Yuan Gaofeng and the other deities of the Confucian Temple manifesting in their golden forms, there were two groups of distinguished guests.

Disguised as a commoner, the Emperor of the Great Sui stood alongside a white-haired eunuch clad in a bright red dragon robe.

There were also two men present: one elderly with white hair who still exuded an imposing aura among earthly rulers and the sages of the Confucian Temple, and a relatively young, refined man who likely deemed himself unworthy to partake in secret matters and had retreated to the front hall to admire the statues of the Seventy-Two Worthies.

The old man was not from the Baoping Continent; he introduced himself as Lin Shuangjiang, possessing a rich accent from Baoping and the dialect of the Great Sui.

Lin Shuangjiang was most likely a pseudonym; that wasn't important. What mattered was that after his arrival in the Great Sui capital, his magical prowess was extraordinary. Even the eunuch in the dragon robe who stood behind the Emperor and a palace official working together could not harm him in the slightest.

Lin Shuangjiang cast a disapproving glance at Yuan Gaofeng and the other literati deities who were engaged in a verbal spar with Mao Xiaodong.

As his gaze shifted, he noticed several deities who had made significant contributions to the founding of the nation, as well as those who, despite being civil officials in the history of the Great Sui, had expanded its territory. These two groups naturally congregated together, akin to a mountain stronghold, creating a subtle but palpable divide between them and the sparsely populated faction led by Yuan Gaofeng. Finally, Lin Shuangjiang's gaze settled on the Emperor of the Great Sui. 

"Your Majesty," he began, "the hearts of the military and the populace of the Great Sui are both at your disposal. The court has its civil strategists, and the battlefield its military tacticians. Given the current situation, must we continue to endure humiliation and bear burdens? It is true that when the pact was signed, the Great Sui could not withstand the cavalry of the Great Li, facing the fate of annihilation. But now, the circumstances have drastically changed. Must Your Majesty still cling to survival at all costs?"

Lin Shuangjiang smirked. "Should I, a foreigner, recount the hundreds of officials from the capital who have resigned their posts or the scholars who have fled to the mountains over the past few years? Do you wish to hear about the severe decline of the military aura from the martial temples across the Great Sui, from the capital down to the provinces? This is a hundred-year alliance, and Your Majesty has traded the reputation of one for the peace of the Great Sui's populace for a century. But can Your Majesty truly guarantee that even if the barbarian Song clan of Great Li keeps their promise and does not raise a single soldier against the Great Sui, your nation can endure in peace for a century? And then, simply wait for heaven to drop a pie, while the Song clan of Great Li brings about their own downfall, allowing you, the Gao family of Goyang, to reap the rewards?"

Lin Shuangjiang's expression turned cold. "A crooked beam will lead to a crooked roof. Your Majesty must be clear on the character of the Song clan of Great Li. Now, with Prince Song Changjing overseeing the state, the martial men hold power. The previous emperor of Great Li even calculated against the Five Sacred Deities related to the Gao clan, stripping them of their titles. Do the mountain oaths between the East Hua Mountain of the Great Sui and the North Yue Mountain of Great Li truly hold any weight? I dare say, within thirty years, even if the Great Li cavalry is stalled at the Zhu Xing Dynasty, the successor to the Great Li throne and that embroidered tiger will successfully digest the entire northern part of Baoping Continent. In thirty years, from the common people to the border forces and the minor officials, and finally to the high-ranking ministers, all will view the Great Li Dynasty as their dream haven."

Lin Shuangjiang's tone grew stern. "By the time the people of the Great Sui view another nation as better than their homeland, how will you, the emperor who facilitated this national disaster, find the face to meet the ancestors of the Gao clan?"

Yuan Gaofeng bellowed, "Lin Shuangjiang, you are outrageous! The affairs of the Great Sui cannot allow you to speak so freely here!"

A civil minister of the Great Sui, who had managed to make the Huangting Kingdom a vassal state with a single strategy, quietly advised, "Your Majesty, think carefully."

Lin Shuangjiang ceased speaking.

The art of opening and closing—"Bai" means to open, to speak. "He" means to close, to remain silent.

The pauses after speaking showcased greater skill, more capable of swaying hearts.

While the rear hall fell into silence, in the front hall, a young man in long robes with a handsome face, akin to Chen Pingan, observed the statues of the Seventy-Two Worthies.

Finally, the Emperor of the Great Sui spoke up, "It was only after Song Zhengchun's death that these two gentlemen came to visit today, correct?"

Lin Shuangjiang nodded in acknowledgment.

The Emperor of the Great Sui pointed to himself and chuckled, "So if one day I were to be killed by a Tenth Realm martial artist, or perhaps stabbed by that Mo family wanderer named Xu Ruo with a flying sword, how would that count?"

He gestured toward his head and then the front hall, "If Xu Ruo were to indiscriminately kill a ruler, as a cultivator, he would likely be punished by some saint over there. Xu Ruo is an important figure of the Mo family; previously, when their side helped craft the replica of the White Jade Capital and it got destroyed, the main branch of the Mo family in Central Plains changed their minds and chose to bet on the Song clan of Great Li. Xu Ruo could very well be the key figure, so he might not be willing to act against me. But if Li Er were to kill me, a purely martial man, it seems according to your mountain's rules, the Confucian saints would not intervene."

Lin Shuangjiang replied calmly, "As long as that Li Er does not reach the 'Divine Arrival' realm among Tenth Realm martial artists, I can ensure he cannot even enter the capital of the Great Sui, provided your Confucian Temple is willing to cooperate with me and activate the city defense formation."

Even so, the Emperor of the Great Sui remained unmoved, continuing to ask, "A thief’s heart is always there; can we truly guard against him? Does Elder Lin plan to stay in the Great Sui forever?"

Lin Shuangjiang frowned slightly.

At this moment, a warm voice echoed in everyone’s hearts, "If Li Er dares to come to the Great Sui capital to kill, I will take responsibility for going out to slay him. I can only guarantee this; as for the rest, I will not interfere."

Yuan Gaofeng scoffed, "Well, well, the Qi cultivators of the Central Plains are indeed formidable—killing a Tenth Realm martial artist is as easy as a child crushing a chick."

Lin Shuangjiang didn’t add much, stating solemnly, "If Mr. Fan says it, then he can do it."

The Emperor of the Great Sui smiled, "Really?"

The man in the front hall replied with a smile, "In business, honesty is the foundation of one's standing."

————

Li Huai followed the method that Pei Qian suggested for playing Gobang, losing terribly.

After conceding, still irked, he randomly swept his hands across the densely placed board of pieces. "I’m done, I’m done! This is boring; playing this game makes my head dizzy and my stomach hungry."

Listening to the crisp sounds of the pieces clacking against each other, Xie Xie, who was practicing at the end of the green bamboo floor corridor, fluttered her eyelashes, feeling slightly restless. She could only open her eyes and glance over, seeing Pei Qian and Li Huai choosing black and white pieces, tossing them back into the nearby container with a clatter.

Although the container was a product of the Great Sui official kiln and worth several tens of taels of silver, Xie Xie knew well that the pieces within it were invaluable.

If it were before when Cui Dongshan was still in this courtyard, Xie Xie would sometimes be dragged along by him to play chess. If she placed a piece too heavily, Cui Dongshan would slap it away, claiming that if she broke one, it would ruin his collection and render it incomplete, which was something Xie Xie couldn’t afford, even with her life.

In the world of chess, common families merely used polished stones, while wealthy families often had ceramic or porcelain pieces. In the mountains, cultivators crafted theirs from special beautiful jade.

However, the two jars of pieces Cui Dongshan had were remarkable; they were the coveted "Colorful Cloud" pieces, created by the owner of the Liuli Pavilion, a disciple of the city lord of Baidi City a millennium ago, using a unique technique known as "Drip Crafting." With the collapse of the Liuli Pavilion, the master vanished for a thousand years, and the special method of "Great Drip Crafting" was lost. There was a story of a chess-loving immortal from the Central Plains who acquired a jar and, to complete it, offered a small fortune for just one piece.

Yet now, the Liuli pieces in Pei Qian and Li Huai’s hands were no better than the ordinary stones on the ground.

Xie Xie sighed inwardly, thankful that the Colorful Cloud pieces were indeed worth their weight, as the young man exerted all his strength without breaking any, instead producing even more resonant sounds.

Li Huai was unwilling to continue with Gobang, so Pei Qian suggested playing a countryside game of picking up stones. Li Huai immediately felt confident; he excelled at this, having often played it with his classmates in the academy. That girl named Shi Chunjia with the curly braids was always losing to him, and he had never been defeated when playing with his sister, Li Liu, at home!

The two each retrieved five pieces from their respective containers and played a round. Finding it too easy, they decided to increase it to ten pieces.

Xie Xie, hearing the crisp sounds echoing louder than the chess pieces falling, felt her heart tremble. She could only hope that Cui Dongshan wouldn’t find out about this disaster.

From time to time, one or two Colorful Cloud pieces would fly out of their hands, dropping onto the courtyard's bluestone floor, only to be picked up by the two youngsters who treated it as nothing.

Xie Xie could no longer concentrate on her breathing exercises, so she stood up and headed to her side room to look for books.

Li Baoping emerged from the main study, squatting beside Pei Qian and Li Huai to observe their game. Li Huai was once again thoroughly defeated.

Quietly, Li Baoping took five black pieces from another jar, returning the five white pieces to the container. On the floor lay five black and five white pieces. She explained to the two staring at each other, "Playing it this way is more interesting. You each choose one color. When picking up stones, for instance, if you, Pei Qian, select black pieces and pick up seven, but there are two white pieces among them, you can only count that as picking up three black pieces."

Pei Qian timidly said, "Sister Baoping, I want to pick white pieces."

Li Baoping nodded, "That’s fine."

Li Huai, feeling frustrated, said, "I want to pick white pieces too!"

Li Baoping shot him a glance.

Li Huai quickly changed his mind, "Never mind, the black pieces look better anyway."

Shi Rou pondered slightly.

This little girl in a red skirt always seemed to have such unique thoughts. Among everyone, Shi Rou observed the most due to Chen Pingan's obvious favoritism towards Li Baoping. She noticed that the girl’s behavior was not deliberately mature; she was quite innocent. Yet, ironically, many of her thoughts fell both within and beyond the realm of rules.

Not long after Shi Rou began observing Li Baoping, the fierce battle concluded. Following Li Baoping's rules, Li Huai lost even worse.

Pei Qian shook his head, weighing a few pieces in his palm, tossing them lightly into the air. "How lonely it is! Is it really that hard to just lose once?"

Li Huai, with a mischievous look, rapidly turned his eyes, wanting to find a different way to regain his dignity.

Pei Qian tossed a piece aside and picked up a hiking staff at his feet, bouncing into the courtyard. "Sister Baoping, your defeated opponent Li Huai, I’ll show you what a long staff can do! I may not have fully mastered my skills yet, but for now, I can only leap from rooftops! Watch closely! You must really look closely!"

He retreated to the wall of the courtyard, facing the opposite wall, taking a deep breath before sprinting forward. Suddenly, he plunged the hiking staff precisely into a crack between the courtyard stones. With his feet leaving the ground, the staff bent into a large arc, and as it snapped back, Pei Qian leaped high into the air, his petite figure extending gracefully as he landed steadily on the wall, turning around to grin at Li Baoping and Li Huai. "See?!"

Li Huai stared, dumbfounded, and shouted, "I want to try too!"

Pei Qian nimbly jumped down from the wall like a little wildcat, landing silently.

He generously tossed the hiking staff to Li Huai.

Li Huai mimicked Pei Qian, retreating to the base of the wall. He first sprinted forward in a quick series of steps, glanced at the ground, and abruptly thrust the hiking staff into a crack between the stones. With a shout, the staff bent under his weight, and Li Huai's body began to rise. However, his final posture and force angle were incorrect, resulting in him flipping upside down, legs in the air, head facing down, letting out a few "ahh" sounds before crashing back to the ground.

In a moment, a gentle breeze whisked by, catching Li Huai and helping him regain his balance.

Li Huai shamelessly declared, "So close! Just a hair's breadth away, what a pity!"

Pei Qian scoffed, "How about I give you ten more chances?"

Li Huai replied earnestly, "Though I, Li Huai, am exceptionally talented, a martial genius one might encounter once in a thousand years, I have no interest in competing with you in such trivial matters."

Li Baoping took the hiking staff from Li Huai and attempted it herself.

As a result, this little girl in a red skirt not only succeeded but did so spectacularly, flying right over the wall.

A faint sound came from outside the wall.

Familiar with such antics, Li Baoping landed safely, though unsteadily, her knees bending as she squatted down and her body fell backward, landing on her rear.

Li Baoping stood up, completely unscathed.

A hunched old man stood not far away, chuckling. "Are you alright?"

Li Baoping smiled, "What could possibly happen?"

Zhu Lian nodded with a grin.

Li Baoping dashed back into the courtyard.

As a martial arts master of the Far Travel realm, Zhu Lian had exceptional vision and, of course, knew that Li Baoping wouldn’t be harmed, which was why he didn’t intervene.

Zhu Lian continued to stroll around the courtyard.

When Chen Pingan left the academy, Zhu Lian had been nearby, listening to the conversation between Chen Pingan and Li Baoping. Chen Pingan had not deliberately concealed anything from him.

Zhu Lian even felt sorry for Sui Youbian, who missed out on that conversation.

Previously, when the four of them were still together, before parting ways at the Dusty Medicine Shop in Old Dragon City, the old man with the surname Xun, who had early on recognized Sui Youbian's "sword immortal potential," often lingered at the medicine shop. Once, while observing a chess game, Sui Youbian and Lu Baixiang battled in the courtyard. The old man, with a few casual remarks, explained the principles of swordsmanship through the game.

In essence, it was a matter of "cutting." This is swordsmanship.

The quality of the chessboard lies in definition. To occupy a mountain is to claim kingship; feudal lords carve out territories; mountains and rivers serve as barriers. All of these represent sword intent.

After the game concluded and the review began, Sui Youbian remained unmoved, which embarrassed the old man. He jokingly scolded Pei Qian for a good while, puffing up his chest and boasting, as if trying to intimidate with empty words. It was no wonder Sui Youbian didn’t appreciate him.

However, that very evening, Sui Youbian entered seclusion to comprehend swordsmanship, remaining inside for two days and nights without leaving.

Now, Sui Youbian had gone to Tongye Continent, aiming to join the Yuguizong, which had inexplicably become a sect leader among the immortal families of the continent, transitioning into a sword cultivator.

Wei Xian had followed Cui Dongshan away.

Lu Baixiang decided to travel the rivers and mountains alone.

Only Zhu Lian remained, choosing to follow Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan had acted twice at the Lion Garden—once against a troublesome monster and once against Li Baozhen. Zhu Lian didn’t think too highly of those feats.

However, Chen Pingan's conversation with Li Baoping left Zhu Lian deep in thought, filled with admiration.

Li Baozhen, Li Baoping, Li Xisheng, the Li family of Fulu Street.

These four were connected by blood, yet Chen Pingan, although referred to as "Little Shishu" by Li Baoping, was ultimately an outsider.

How Chen Pingan dealt with Li Baozhen was extremely complex. To wish for an outcome that did not hurt Li Baoping, no matter the result, was nearly impossible. It was a situation where no matter what he did, it was "not wrong," yet also "not right," a deadlock.

If Chen Pingan concealed this matter or simply explained the circumstances of his encounter with Li Baozhen at the Lion Garden, Li Baoping would certainly have no issues, and interactions with Chen Pingan would remain unchanged.

But if one day Chen Pingan were to kill the self-destructive Li Baozhen, even if he were entirely justified, Li Baoping would understand the reasoning, yet that wouldn’t matter to the little girl in her heart; she would still feel hurt.

This was the crux.

Thus, that conversation took place.

Zhu Lian walked slowly, murmuring to himself, "This is the swordsmanship of the human heart, cutting with precision."

What is cutting?

Chen Pingan refrained from killing Li Baozhen the first time, adhering to the promise made to Li Xisheng, which essentially aligns with the law.

Additionally, using Li Baozhen’s family heirloom, he made a "pawn" with Li Baoping and the entire Li family of Fulu Street, reflecting the principles of human sentiment.

This separated Li Baozhen from the entire Li family of Fulu Street, akin to Cui Dongshan’s flying sword, confining Li Baozhen within a delineated space.

Li Baozhen is Li Baozhen, while the Li family behind Li Baoping and Li Xisheng is the Li family after Li Baozhen has been removed.

Chen Pingan drew a circle and established a boundary.

And quietly, he pointed out a mental path for Li Baoping, providing a possibility of "no one is wrong, and everyone can bear responsibility for life or death" with an open heart. Looking back later, even if Chen Pingan and Li Baozhen faced life or death, Li Baoping, even if still saddened, would not shift from one extreme to another.

This was what the old man with the surname Xun referred to as swordsmanship.

Chen Pingan's swordsmanship happened to align perfectly with this principle.

It was a subtle tug-of-war of human hearts.

So that day, Chen Pingan also watched a chess game in the medicine shop's backyard and heard the old man with the surname Xun's invaluable words. Zhu Lian could assert that even if Sui Youbian spent two days and nights in seclusion to comprehend swordsmanship, he might not grasp its true essence more than Chen Pingan.

Everyone's path has its distances, but there are also distinctions in height and depth.

He recalled the two phrases Li Baoping had taught Pei Qian.

"Carry the bamboo box, wear grass sandals, a million punches, and the youthful boy is the most at ease."

"Carry the immortal sword, wear the white robe, traveling thousands of miles, the best little Shishu in the human world."

Zhu Lian muttered to himself, "Your little Shishu, Little Baoping, although he may not yet be a sword cultivator, surely has the heart of a sword immortal forming within him, right?"

Suddenly, Zhu Lian halted, gazing down the small path leading to the courtyard, squinting his eyes to look.

There appeared an elderly scholar accompanied by a white deer.

(End of Chapter)### Chapter 410: Some Stories Are Better Left Untold

The tavern was bustling both inside and out.

The Great Sui Dynasty was known for its wealth, and the common folk were eager to spend their money. After all, under the rule of the Ge family of Gao, the country had enjoyed an incredibly stable and prosperous era for hundreds of years.

At a window on the second floor, Mao Xiaodong gazed outside and reminded Chen Ping'an behind her, "Remember to protect yourself; there’s no need to worry about me."

Five assassins lurked nearby: a Ninth Realm Golden Core Sword Cultivator, a Dragon Gate Military Master, a Dragon Gate Array Master, a Far Travel Martial Artist, and a Golden Body Martial Artist.

Regardless of their identities or standings, they had all gathered together, hidden within a thousand feet of this tavern.

With such a lineup, it was safe to say that even a Yu Pu Realm cultivator could be killed, let alone a mere Nascent Soul Earth Immortal.

Chen Ping'an recalled the incident at the City God Pavilion in the Kingdom of Colorful Clothes, where he had encountered a girl with bells tied around her wrists and ankles. Although their meeting was brief and she was the daughter of a county magistrate with low cultivation, she always managed to lend a helping hand at just the right moment, leaving him with a favorable impression.

After journeying through two continents and a suspended mountain, Chen Ping'an had always been either fighting alone against powerful foes or negotiating with his companions to seal the deal. Yet now, in the capital of the Great Sui, he found himself merely standing behind Mao Xiaodong. This situation felt strange to him. Still, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of regret; after all, he was not in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land where "the heavens press down with the Dao," and upon returning to the world of Haoran, his cultivation remained too low.

Mao Xiaodong chuckled, "When you reach my age and are still an unaccomplished Nascent Soul cultivator, I'll make sure to scold you thoroughly."

Chen Ping'an sighed and patted the sword pouch at his waist, sending a silent message to his flying swords, First and Fifteenth, to be ready for the appearance of the assassins.

Within the golden robes, his right hand held a shrinking talisman for ambush defense, while his left gripped a talisman for repelling strong enemies.

Mao Xiaodong felt much more at ease.

Her little junior brother's long journey through the martial world had not been in vain.

Suddenly, Mao Xiaodong's voice echoed in Chen Ping'an's heart, "Have you ever walked along the River of Time? It’s even more unbearable than experiencing the oppressive righteous energy at the Confucian Temple."

Chen Ping'an responded with a martial artist's technique of gathering sound, "I’ve walked it twice. The first time was before I learned martial arts, in a small town in the Liuzhu Cave Heaven. The second time was in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, where the old master of the Guan Dao pulled me along. I must have seen at least two hundred years' worth of flowing time, and it often felt like the sequence was reversed, intertwining back and forth. So even though I had already reached the Fifth Realm of martial arts, it was still extremely difficult, just like when I was at Falling Stone Mountain getting fed punches."

Mao Xiaodong laughed, "You should have mentioned that during our chats in the study! Such an impressive feat is worth boasting about. If you don’t share it, it’s like suffering for nothing. Even I, as a Nascent Soul cultivator, had never experienced the scenery of the River of Time before becoming the master of the Cliffside Academy. Only Yu Pu Realm cultivators get to see that."

Chen Ping'an's eyes lit up as he suddenly realized, "So, Master Mao really has the ability to move mountains and temporarily turns this place into a small academy?"

Mao Xiaodong nodded, "That’s right. In these past few years, with the protection of the Little Treasure Bottle, I’ve roamed around the capital of the Great Sui, pulling the wool over everyone’s eyes to accomplish this secret task. One must always be wary."

Chen Ping'an agreed, "I can understand that."

Mao Xiaodong laughed in annoyance, "You haven’t even called me 'Brother Mao' once. Why should I let you understand?"

Chen Ping'an felt guilty and chose to remain silent.

With one hand behind her, Mao Xiaodong raised her arm and, using her fingers like a brush, swiftly wrote the four characters "Cliffside Academy." With each stroke, golden light flowed from her fingertips, shimmering without dissipating.

Once finished, she flicked her sleeve and said with a smile, "To the realms of heaven and earth!"

The four golden characters flashed away in all directions.

Mao Xiaodong turned and said, "Now we can sit back and drink."

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished.

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, a familiar sensation etched in his heart, surging like the torrent of a river, making him feel as though he had suddenly been plunged underwater, like someone who couldn’t swim.

The world fell silent.

The tavern was no longer filled with any sounds.

The Dragon Gate Array Master, who had been secretly arranging formations, suddenly found his spiritual energy stagnating, unable to flow smoothly. He looked up in shock, realizing that all the pedestrians outside had stopped moving, and the birds in the sky appeared to be frozen in mid-air.

Unable to hide his presence any longer, the array master let his immense aura pour out, gripping a golden talisman between his fingers, preparing to take action.

A hand pressed down on his shoulder, and a voice chuckled, "Your formation is derived from the Dragon Gate Array passed down by the Daoist Lord Ning Quanzhen of the Central Plains, isn’t it?"

The array master was taken aback.

He found himself unable to break free from the large hand resting on his shoulder. His face flushed, and he hoped that one of the other four would come to his rescue.

As an array master, he relied on the power of the formation to channel the forces of heaven and earth. His physical training was vastly inferior to that of sword cultivators, military masters, and pure martial artists.

Fortunately, the array master did not lose all hope.

A brilliant sword light emanating from the northeast, like a white line, rapidly rushed toward him, its tip aimed directly at Mao Xiaodong's brow.

This sword light, within the small realm, did not follow a perfectly straight path; instead, the tip trembled slightly, the body of the flying sword fluctuating unpredictably.

With a sizzling sound, wherever the flying sword passed, sparks flew like electrical discharges, capturing attention.

The sharp flying sword clashed against the fabric of the small realm.

Mao Xiaodong did not dodge, showing no signs of activating her abundant Nascent Soul energy.

The flying sword, which was less than a yard away from the towering elder and the array master, suddenly stirred up a ripple, crashing into the small realm like a stone thrown into a lake, disappearing in an instant.

At the same time, the array master began to bleed from all seven orifices, trembling uncontrollably. With this motion, he collided once again with the omnipresent flow of time within the small realm, causing even more blood to gush forth. What was even more terrifying was that his internal energy was in disarray, and all the key energy centers in his body began to feel as if they were pierced by countless needles. The array master struggled to move his fingers, which held the life-saving talisman. His fingers could move, but the thick, mercury-like spiritual energy in his body had crystallized, making it impossible for him to budge.

Mao Xiaodong grasped the array master's neck and casually tossed him behind her.

The Golden Core sword cultivator's life sword surged forth, creating a whirlpool of energy as it stabbed out like a fierce intruder.

But it came just a moment too late.

The severely injured array master happened to block the path of the flying sword.

The Ninth Realm sword cultivator showed no intention of stopping his advance; he pierced through the array master's body, using his will to guide the sword deeper, continuing to strike at Mao Xiaodong!

The array master fell dead on the spot, his eyes wide open in disbelief.

Wasn’t it said that Mao Xiaodong had merely left Donghua Mountain and was just a Nascent Soul cultivator?

In the path of cultivation, with various schools and teachings, from alchemy to herbalism, from invoking deities to divination, forging inner elixirs, and stepping into the mortal realm, once one crossed the threshold into the Fifth Realm, they became immortal figures in the eyes of common scholars, indeed enjoying endless glory.

But cultivators isolating themselves from the mundane world on the mountainsides do so for a reason.

Because down in the world, there are also those who do not fear the supernatural.

And even Confucian academies.

Mao Xiaodong stepped out, appearing dozens of feet away, turning around just in time to capture the flying sword that had followed her.

Though this feat of casually pinching the flying sword between her fingers was astonishing enough to make a Yu Pu Realm immortal gasp, as she dissipated the sword’s intent, the small realm she commanded began to subtly tremble.

The Far Travel martial artist, trapped within another's small realm, could no longer ride the winds, but he rushed forward like thunder. He crashed through two walls, barreling through the tavern toward Mao Xiaodong with a fist ready to strike.

Inside the tavern, several people were crushed by his charge, their bodies collapsing into fragments that slowly suspended in the air.

This man's punch gathered all the pure vitality he could muster, striking without any reserve, even willing to exchange his life for an attack.

Mao Xiaodong mobilized the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, raising a monument inscribed with golden words and summoning a magically appearing archway, which shattered into powder under the force of the Far Travel martial artist's punch.

The elderly martial artist, at the Eighth Realm, charged fiercely, unstoppable.

Meanwhile, the Golden Body martial artist who leaped onto the roof approached with less speed but, with golden body vigor, collided with the flow of time in the small realm, igniting a blaze of flames upon him. He leaped down, aiming directly at Mao Xiaodong standing on the street.

Mao Xiaodong, with slight wounds on her fingers, tossed the flying sword she had imprisoned at the Golden Body martial artist.

She extended her palm, blocking the punch of the Far Travel martial arts master.

Mao Xiaodong's sleeves billowed violently, her whiskers flying.

The Golden Body martial artist, a close friend of the Golden Core sword cultivator, did not hesitate to attack Mao Xiaodong despite the sword’s tip aimed at his heart.

Indeed, the sword cultivator felt a shift in his heart lake, his spiritual intuition slightly stirred, and he made an effort to redirect the sword's tip, merely piercing the martial artist's shoulder.

Mao Xiaodong was hit squarely in the back by the punch of the Seventh Realm martial artist, who should have been the weakest.

The small realm trembled.

With the punch intercepted, the Far Travel martial artist took the opportunity to unleash a barrage of blows.

In a flurry of light, Mao Xiaodong was forced to retreat step by step as the Far Travel elder’s muscles bulged, blood seeping from his clothes, yet every punch became more ferocious than the last.

The Golden Body martial artist did not take advantage of the situation to attack Mao Xiaodong alongside the Far Travel master; instead, he kept pace with the two, not wanting to miss the opportunity to strike her down, but he understood the gravity of the situation.

Chen Ping'an did not remain stationary but leapt out of the window, landing on the tavern roof where he had a broader view.

He also chose not to intervene in this battle.

The Far Travel elder's last punch sent Mao Xiaodong flying back several dozen feet.

The elder immediately halted and retreated, needing to catch his breath.

The Golden Body martial artist quickly moved a few steps to block the path between the Far Travel elder and Mao Xiaodong, standing firm between them.

Even so, that was still not secure enough.

The Ninth Realm sword cultivator seized the opportunity.

The flying sword zipped past.

It aimed directly at Mao Xiaodong.

The speed was so fast it surpassed the first appearance of this life sword.

This was both because Mao Xiaodong's aura was unstable, causing the laws of heaven and earth to become less rigid, and because the Golden Core sword cultivator had taken the time to find some gaps and shortcuts with just a few rotations of the flying sword. The immortal who presided over the small realm was said to have an impenetrable celestial net, but even the most tightly woven net has its holes, and this one was constantly shifting.

To become the most favored sword cultivator under heaven, and to ascend to the Golden Core Earth Immortal level, none were to be trifled with.

Mao Xiaodong grasped the ruler at her waist, stabilizing her stance.

Her once snow-white beard was now speckled with blood.

Facing the slender flying sword that was like a bone worm, Mao Xiaodong did not attempt to fix it in place with her fingers this time.

With a sweep of her sleeve, she directly enveloped the flying sword within.

As her sleeve billowed, strands of sword energy burst forth, the fabric fluttering while the sounds of tearing silk echoed.

The Far Travel martial artist had already regained his breath. With a push against the ground, he left spiderweb-like cracks on the street, his overwhelming might surged forward again, determined to use the opportunity created by his ally to engage in close combat with Mao Xiaodong, not giving this “unexpected” Cliffside Academy master any chance to create distance and wear them down.

With a Far Travel master fixated on her.

A typical Earth Immortal's energy sea would be drawn in, leaving no room for distraction.

A tall man clad in silver armor employed two exceedingly rare high-grade talismans and a green bamboo raincoat talisman to seize one of the weakest points in the flow of time. He descended from the sky, interlocking his fingers together, and aimed a punch at Mao Xiaodong's head.

In that critical moment.

The flying sword concealed within Mao Xiaodong's sleeve was about to break free.

The Far Travel martial arts master was about to strike.

But the truly perilous attack came from the Dragon Gate military cultivator.

Aside from the array master, who had hardly been of any use, the four assassins worked together seamlessly.

It was hard to believe that only the Ninth Realm sword cultivator and the Golden Body martial artist were long-time acquaintances among the four.

Mao Xiaodong's ruler fell from her waist.

It slapped against the face of the military cultivator, sending him flying away and crashing onto the roof of a distant building, shattering tiles in the process.

Mao Xiaodong's toes brushed the ground as she raised her sleeve, pointing at the furthest sword cultivator, "Here, take it back."

In an instant, heaven and earth flipped and twisted.

It was as if a piece of paper had been twisted by a mischievous child without being crumpled into a ball, presenting an indescribably bizarre scene.

The Far Travel martial artist watched helplessly as he brushed past Mao Xiaodong.

Mao Xiaodong had seemingly turned "upside down."

Clearly within reach.

Yet somehow, she felt far away.

The surface of the paper was densely covered with golden characters, each the size of a fist, representing classic Confucian texts meant to enlighten the masses.

He turned and shouted, "Be careful!"

Mao Xiaodong appeared to move slowly, yet after one figure of hers disappeared to the east, she instantly materialized to the west, then shifted to the north. No matter how she changed her position, she always closed the distance to the Golden Body martial artist.

The Golden Body martial artist didn’t even know where to evade.

In such a manner, the tall elder appeared suddenly before him and slapped his entire head off.

The Dragon Gate military cultivator was bombarded by the ruler falling like raindrops on his armor.

The small realm returned to its normal order.

Mao Xiaodong gripped the body without a head, preventing it from falling, and looked toward the distant, red-eyed Ninth Realm sword cultivator, asking, "Are you not going to take revenge for your friend?"

With a sudden flick of her wrist, she sent the body flying, crashing against the wall of a shop and turning into a mushy pile of flesh.

The Ninth Realm sword cultivator and the Far Travel martial artist witnessed countless smaller golden characters pouring into the aura of the towering elder.

Their expressions turned solemn, and a sense of desolation filled their hearts.

How could they continue fighting?

They exchanged glances, both seeing determination in the other's eyes.

Mao Xiaodong surveyed her surroundings; so far, there were no signs of any hidden Yu Pu Realm cultivators.

This meant that these five assassins, determined to die, had no backup.

Mao Xiaodong raised her tattered sleeve and glanced at it, then looked up and said, "You sword cultivators and Earth Immortals, all you martial arts masters, always claim that the academy cultivators are just talkers, mere flower pillows, right?"

Mao Xiaodong smiled, "Well, you are indeed correct."

The sword cultivator and the Far Travel martial artist felt a tightening in their hearts.

Mao Xiaodong strolled leisurely, as if a scholar pondering in a study.

From the fringes of this small realm, flying swords resembling the life swords of cultivators began to swirl.

Although the swords were of relatively low quality, roughly equivalent to the life swords of Guan Hai and Dragon Gate cultivators, their sheer number was overwhelming.

Who would dare to take it lightly?

Moreover, on various rooftops, figures of young scholars in green robes appeared, some holding books, some bearing swords.

They were similarly low in cultivation.

They similarly relied on numbers to win.

In the streets and alleys, waves of armored soldiers surged forth.

The diverse sizes and shapes of flying swords rushed toward the Golden Core sword cultivator.

The scholars on the rooftops and the armored soldiers on the ground charged toward the Far Travel martial artist.

Mao Xiaodong approached the military cultivator struggling against the ruler but did not get close, saying, "You are truly the one willing to die, aren’t you? Hiding behind your military armor with the heart of an Earth Immortal, you intend to perish together with me the moment you come close, even if you can’t kill me, taking half your life with you will be enough to ensure I remain here."

The Dragon Gate military cultivator’s eyes glinted with determination, ignoring Mao Xiaodong's words as he defended himself against the ruler, preventing it from shattering his armor.

Mao Xiaodong extended her hand, pointing at the cultivator.

Golden characters began to rise from the ground around him, forming a cage like beams of a house rising from the earth.

The military cultivator forced a bitter smile, his face twisted in agony. Countless golden threads burst forth from his body and aura, causing him to explode violently.

Though he couldn’t kill Mao Xiaodong, he aimed to destroy the ruler, which was undoubtedly crucial to her.

Yet, the self-detonation of a Dragon Gate military cultivator, along with the explosion of a Golden Core, managed to obliterate the golden cage of Confucian texts.

However, the ruler remained unscathed, albeit the engraved characters lost some of their brilliance.

It floated gently back into Mao Xiaodong's hand.

Mao Xiaodong hung it at her waist.

Despite the Ninth Realm sword cultivator facing peril, his life was not in danger.

The Far Travel elder killed mercilessly, shattering all the scholars and armored soldiers within three yards, and using his immense vigor blended with the chaos to turn the puppets infused with spiritual energy into a murky atmosphere that Mao Xiaodong could not control.

Mao Xiaodong maintained an expressionless demeanor, allowing the remaining two assassins to gradually exhaust their spiritual and genuine energy.

Ultimately, the spiritual energy within the small realm would reach its limit.

This directly affected the stability and duration of this "Cliffside Academy."

Thus, the space of the small realm had unknowingly shrunk to around four hundred feet.

If this were Donghua Mountain, where the true Cliffside Academy lay, Mao Xiaodong's techniques could likely maintain a range of eight hundred feet.

This skill was not the official mountain-moving art of the Confucian academy; it allowed Mao Xiaodong to step into the Yu Pu Realm, but the flaw was that the essence of the Cliffside Academy remained incomplete, still tethered to Donghua Mountain.

However, that was not a major issue.

As long as the remaining two assassins had no outside interference, they would still end up sacrificing their lives here.

Even if, hypothetically, Mao Xiaodong withdrew her small realm's divine powers and temporarily handed Donghua Mountain back to the Yuan Ying guard at the academy gate, killing enemies might be tough, but self-preservation would not be.

Yet, if such a situation arose, it would not be a delightful experience.

Mao Xiaodong furrowed her brow.

A flying sword, golden like wheat, suddenly intruded into this small realm.

It abruptly hovered in the air and pointed in a direction, bobbing up and down.

Without hesitation, Mao Xiaodong withdrew her divine powers, "falling back" to her Nascent Soul cultivation.

Chen Ping'an, who had been watching from the rooftop, didn’t even need Mao Xiaodong to notify him telepathically.

He clapped his sword pouch, and First and Fifteenth flew out.

A square inch talisman ignited in Chen Ping'an's sleeve; he did not target the Far Travel elder but instead shrank down and rushed straight toward the much more terrifying Ninth Realm sword cultivator.

If someone were to observe, they would think Chen Ping'an had chosen the wrong opponent.

Simultaneously, two towering figures of the Day and Night Travel Gods, with a might even more imposing than the previous military cultivator, descended from the skies, smashing down toward the martial arts grandmaster before Chen Ping'an made his move.

The Day Travel God donned golden armor, radiating brilliance, wielding an axe.

The Night Travel God donned black armor, holding a large halberd.

Mao Xiaodong smiled knowingly.

She too clapped her ruler and then rushed toward the Ninth Realm sword cultivator.

The Far Travel martial artist, determined to die in this small realm, showed no fear of battle.

Yet, when Mao Xiaodong unexpectedly retracted her divine powers, he thought that as long as he and the Golden Core sword cultivator worked together sincerely, they might still have a chance.

However, just as the situation seemed to turn in their favor and no longer looked like a guaranteed death, the Far Travel martial artist hesitated, then soared into the air, fleeing.

The sword cultivator was initially taken aback but then immediately retreated without a word.

Mao Xiaodong called out, "Since we’re not in a dominant position, let’s not chase a retreating enemy."

However, she noticed that Chen Ping'an had already stopped and had no intention of pursuing, yet he did not immediately retract the two divine beings, allowing the divine money to flow away from his pouch.

Mao Xiaodong approached Chen Ping'an, "Wait for me to rest a moment, and then I’ll take you back to the academy."

Chen Ping'an nodded, his eyes still scanning the surroundings, even as the hand that held the sword behind him did not release its grip.

He allowed the palm to burn, flesh and blood chafing.

Young as he was, he was already a veteran of the world.

The Ninth Realm sword cultivator, having lost a close friend here, felt even more murderous intent.

Thus, Chen Ping'an immediately chose this person as his target.

The Far Travel elder, on the other hand, had a retreat route available. No one could predict whether he would flee, but at least he had a greater chance of leaving than the Golden Core sword cultivator, who had abandoned his ally in danger.

Mao Xiaodong’s retraction of the small realm occurred in an instant.

Chen Ping'an made this decision in a split second as well.

Because of this.

This action made the Far Travel martial artist feel wary and suspicious. Why did the other side choose to target the more dangerous sword cultivator? Was it truly a matter of closing the net? Or was there another trap waiting for them?

Chen Ping'an released his grip on the sword while simultaneously pulling back the two divine beings emanating rare celestial might.

As the world returned to normal, terrified screams erupted around them.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the ground nearby, where the head of the Golden Body martial artist lay.

Three had died, and two had fled.

In life and death, each had their reasons.

"It's time to leave."

Mao Xiaodong pressed her hand on Chen Ping'an's shoulder and simply said, "Some stories of others are better left unknown. What purpose does knowing serve?"

*(End of Chapter)*### Chapter 411: Some Things Must Be Known

Zhu Lian had never met the venerable Confucian Zhao She, who was invited to visit the academy, but he had heard about the striking white deer that accompanied him from Li Baoping.

The Zhao She, led by Gao Guanbo, moved with the same rhythm of footfalls and breath as any ordinary old man.

Even if Zhu Lian couldn’t detect anything amiss, the tension in his heart tightened immediately.

At this moment, every figure appearing near the courtyard could potentially be a death warrior of the Great Sui.

Immortal arts and techniques were ever-changing, making them hard to guard against.

Combat among immortals was a battle of wits and courage. Zhu Lian had sparred with Cui Dongshan twice and was well aware of the myriad uses of magical treasures in the hands of cultivators, which opened his eyes wide to the capabilities of someone who was once the number one in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

If it weren’t for his association with Chen Pingan and the fact that his household registration was under the Great Li Dynasty, Zhu Lian’s nature would have compelled him to act. He believed in the principle of "better to mistakenly kill than to let go."

However, refraining from impulsively killing didn’t mean Zhu Lian lacked the means to probe the depths of his opponent.

He glanced at a sycamore tree along the roadside, and a leaf stem from the verdant sycamore suddenly snapped off, shooting toward Zhao She, who was accompanied by the white deer.

Zhao She remained oblivious, continuing his path.

Just as the sycamore leaf was about to sever the old Confucian’s head, it suddenly lost control and transformed into an ordinary falling leaf, drifting gently to the ground.

Having traveled through two continents, Zhu Lian understood the significance of a Confucian academy’s mountain master. Even if it wasn’t one of the seventy-two academies, a private academy established by prominent scholars from various nations served as a powerful amulet.

This status was comparable to that of earthly monarchs or royal families, granting them protection from Confucian circles.

If a cultivator dared to assassinate, it would provoke pursuit from the Confucian academy. The entire Haoran realm was under Confucian oversight—where could one flee? Either they would find refuge in lesser-known broken caves and blessed lands through secret channels, or they would have to stay far away from the world. However, if it were treacherous ministers, eunuchs, or royal relatives harming the monarch, whether in usurpation or supporting a puppet, the seventy-two academies would not intervene.

If Zhu Lian truly severed the head of a mountain master from a private academy and Zhao She turned out to be a genuine aged scholar who had come to visit Cui Dongshan on a whim, Zhu Lian would undoubtedly end up in a dire situation.

Yet Zhu Lian was undeterred. He deftly kicked a pebble by the roadside, sending it flying toward Zhao She’s calf.

He controlled the force with the precision of a cultivator at the Seventh Realm Golden Body stage.

The unfortunate old Confucian let out a yelp, looking down to see a gash torn into the side of his calf, blood streaming down, and he broke into a cold sweat.

Zhao She raised his head, gritting his teeth, “Who are you?! Why attack and injure me? Do you know this is the Mountain Cliff Academy?!”

Zhu Lian feigned surprise, a hint of fear in his demeanor, muttering curses under his breath, “Didn’t they say the mountain master of the academy was a distinguished Qi practitioner with the blessing of the heavens? With a white deer as a spirit companion, how come he’s such a useless old man who can’t even take a hit? How tragic, how tragic…”

Then Zhao She saw the man rush over, putting on a smile, “My apologies, my apologies! I was lost in thought, playing with stones, and accidentally blocked your path, Zhao Mountain Master. Truly, I deserve to die a thousand deaths…”

Zhao She was in considerable pain, forced to bend over, his face pale with a cold sweat, probably too afraid to look at the bloody wound, and he glared fiercely at the trembling, hunched old man.

Zhu Lian approached Zhao She, extending a hand to support him. “Mountain Master Zhao, let me help you to the courtyard to tend to your injury.”

Zhao She allowed Zhu Lian to grasp his arm, lamenting, “How can there be such a reckless warrior like you? Since you’ve learned some combat techniques, you should restrain yourself. A child’s tantrum is not the same as a young man’s brawl! The saying 'A chivalrous man disrupts the law with his martial prowess' is precisely about people like you!”

Zhu Lian nodded repeatedly in agreement.

In a flash.

Accustomed to bending over, Zhu Lian suddenly shrank his form, like an old ape, sidestepping and stepping heavily to crash into Zhao She’s embrace.

A life sword that should have pierced Zhu Lian’s forehead merely penetrated his shoulder instead.

Zhao She was struck by Zhu Lian’s forceful impact and was sent flying, crashing into the white deer behind him.

Zhao She twisted in mid-air before landing, his expression furious.

Why was there a martial artist from the distant travel realm hiding here at the academy?!

Zhu Lian, disregarding the blood-soaked wound on his shoulder, gazed with fervor, grinning, “At last, I’ve experienced the prowess of an Earth Immortal sword cultivator—what a thrill!”

Inside the courtyard, Yu Lu leaped onto the high wall and spoke solemnly, “They’ve come.”

Xie Xie warned, “Baoping, Li Huai, Pei Qian, you three retreat into the study and remember to close the door tightly. You must not step out unless I come to open it!”

The three children didn’t ask further questions and dashed inside.

Lin Shouyi spoke softly, “I might not be able to assist much now.”

Yu Lu focused on the standoff between Zhu Lian and Zhao She. “Find your own opportunity.”

Xie Xie entered the courtyard, silently reciting incantations, forming hand seals and stepping into the proper stance. Following the secret techniques taught by Cui Dongshan, she began to manipulate the spiritual energy of the courtyard, temporarily transforming it into a delicate little world. This would allow her a taste of what it felt like to wield the flow of time. If Mao Xiaodong’s mastery of time was like a great river, then Xie Xie could only summon a small stream.

Fortunately, the courtyard was not very large, making it difficult for significant flaws to appear.

The inexplicably turned assassin, the old Confucian, hadn’t yet wielded his life sword to battle Zhu Lian for life and death.

That flying sword traced arcs in the air, repeatedly attempting to breach the courtyard.

Each time the sword tried to invade, it would be repelled by the little world’s canopy, exploding into a dazzling brilliance, like shards of glass shattering.

Yu Lu had already retreated into the courtyard, softly inquiring, “How long can we hold out?”

Xie Xie’s forehead glistened with sweat, her voice trembled as she forced a smile, “Even if Zhu Lian can hold back this sword cultivator, preventing him from wielding his sword with full force, I can only maintain this for half a stick of incense at most… The sword’s assault is too fierce, and the spiritual energy the courtyard holds is depleting too quickly!”

Sword cultivators were indeed the best at breaking through various barriers.

A single sword could shatter myriad methods, and it wasn’t just the self-aggrandizement of sword cultivators.

Xie Xie lamented, “It’s a pity that Master Mao has left Donghua Mountain.”

Yu Lu shook his head. “If Master Mao didn’t leave, the opponent would have other countermeasures to ensure he wouldn’t remain. Perhaps he and Chen Pingan have successfully lured the enemy’s main force into a situation even more perilous than this.”

On the small path outside the courtyard, Zhu Lian moved with such speed that he seemed to vanish in a puff of green smoke. The sword cultivator, meanwhile, tried to avoid confrontation, focusing instead on breaking through the little world’s defenses, causing vibrant, colored lights to erupt above the courtyard.

Facing an opponent who occupied the advantageous terrain and could engage in close combat, the sword cultivator Zhao She found himself in quite a difficult position.

If it were originally evenly matched pure martial artists and Qi practitioners, once the former closed the distance, the latter would be in dire straits.

However, the reason sword cultivators were often avoided was precisely due to their ability to unleash tremendous killing power in both long-range and close combat.

Zhu Lian swept his leg to slam the sword cultivator’s head against a sycamore tree, breaking the tree.

Zhu Lian also suffered, as the opponent's life sword pierced through his abdomen.

True to his nature as a martial lunatic, Zhu Lian wiped the blood flowing from his belly, looked at it, and burst into laughter, smearing the blood across his face before continuing to chase the sword cultivator.

In the heat of battle, with life and death hanging in the balance, Zhu Lian still had the leisure to remind the little courtyard, “Be careful! This old fellow might be hiding his true capabilities. I don’t think he’s just an ordinary Nascent Soul!”

The old Confucian Zhao She spat out a mouthful of blood, chuckling after hearing this, as he produced a talisman and covered himself with it, seemingly planning to retreat into his shell.

He then turned to look at the little courtyard, bellowing, “Open up!”

With a single stroke of his sword, he unleashed his life sword.

The sword, which had always been swift, now erupted with an overwhelming essence of fire.

When it struck the little world’s barrier, a resounding boom echoed, causing the entire little courtyard’s flow of time to shudder violently. Yu Lu, as a martial artist at the Golden Body stage, could still maintain her footing, but Lin Shouyi, who hadn’t reached the Fifth Realm yet, found it exceedingly difficult to endure.

Blood trickled from Xie Xie’s lips, and she remained motionless.

As the focal point of this little world, Xie Xie was ultimately too weak and couldn’t afford to move; otherwise, the stability of the entire courtyard would be compromised, leading to even more flaws.

Xie Xie formed hand seals, her eyes beginning to bleed.

Old Confucian Zhao She, donning the protective talisman, laughed during the fight with Zhu Lian, “You’ve decided to entangle with me in a battle? Allowing my sword to break through your defenses and not even trying to save yourself?”

His fire sword, if cultivated to the utmost by its master, could easily boil lakes or burn rivers once he reached the Jade Purity realm. What was a mere little world, especially one run by a girl who hadn’t even reached the Dragon Gate realm?

Xie Xie’s face was already smeared with blood and grime, yet she persisted. But when human strength reached its limit, after spitting out a mouthful of blood, she fainted and crumpled to the ground.

The flying sword didn’t just pierce the little world inch by inch; it appeared to burn a hole the size of a winnowing basket through the very fabric of the realm.

Thus, whether Xie Xie, as the host of this little world, remained conscious or fell unconscious, it mattered little now.

Yu Lu leaped high, striking the flying sword.

Her fist shattered the air, and the Nascent Soul Earth Immortal’s flying sword pierced through her fingers, emerging from the back of her hand, heading directly toward the main house study.

Already suffering immensely from the flow of time, the sudden removal of the little world caught Lin Shouyi off guard, leaving him dazed and teetering as he reached out to steady himself against the corridor pillar, rasping, “Block it!”

Shi Rou appeared at the window of the study, closing her eyes and allowing the fire sword to pierce her immortal shell's abdomen.

A finger snap echoed softly, yet it rang clearly in the ears of everyone in the courtyard.

At the foot of Donghua Mountain, by the courtyard gate, the old Confucian with the surname Liang handed over a jade token, staring intently at the white-clad youth beside him who was twirling a golden flying sword. He said sternly, “Cui Dongshan, I’ll trust you this once. Temporarily, the academy is in your hands. If anything goes wrong…”

The fellow standing at the gate tightened his grip on the jade token, took a deep breath, and smiled, “Got it, got it—just you, Liang, can talk the most.”

The flying sword, resembling golden wheat, known as “Golden Autumn,” was the same sword that had previously alerted Donghua Mountain about the impending trouble.

Cui Dongshan stepped across the academy’s entrance, closed his eyes, and tilted his head back, his face filled with delight. “How many years has it been since I’ve inhaled this pure and righteous spirit as someone above the Fifth Realm?”

Cui Dongshan opened his eyes, snapped his fingers, and in an instant, Donghua Mountain became its own realm. “First, let’s close the door and deal with the dog.”

Then, taking a step forward, he arrived in his own courtyard, rubbing his hands together with a smile, “And now, we’ll deal with the dog. The senior sister speaks with wisdom; if we’re to strike, let’s hit the wildest dog first.”

Xie Xie had already fainted and was suddenly thrown back into the little world, just like Lin Shouyi, who had also lost consciousness.

Even Yu Lu, despite being at the Golden Body stage, couldn’t move a step.

Shi Rou’s situation was the most ludicrous because, with her immortal shell, her spirit wasn’t as easily affected by the turbulent flow of time in the little world.

However, after swallowing that fire sword, it raged within her like a headless fly.

This caused Shi Rou, standing at the window, to tumble about in the air, front and back, swaying uncontrollably.

Seeing Shi Rou in such disarray, Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes, feeling that she was embarrassing him. He stretched out a hand and gently clapped the air.

Shi Rou’s entire immortal shell was smacked into the green bamboo corridor, fracturing the floor beneath her.

What seemed like a casual slap directly knocked Shi Rou’s spiritual awareness and consciousness into a stupor.

Cui Dongshan stepped on Shi Rou’s abdomen, and as Shi Rou inadvertently struck the “Golden Autumn” fire sword, it immediately quieted down.

Cui Dongshan crouched down, intending to use secret techniques to “retrieve” the decent quality flying sword from Shi Rou’s abdomen.

Outside the courtyard, the Nascent Soul sword cultivator traced a long arc, fleeing toward the western side of Donghua Mountain. Realizing that killing anyone had become a luxury, he even discarded his life sword.

Cui Dongshan yawned, standing up, “It’s a good thing Mao Xiaodong isn’t at the academy; otherwise, if he saw the next scene, this academy’s sage would be so embarrassed he’d want to dig a hole to bury himself.”

At the edge of the small world near Donghua Mountain’s western academy, a towering golden body statue appeared, representing the Confucian patron saint.

The sword cultivator was frightened and immediately fled northward.

Another patron saint’s golden body stood tall between heaven and earth.

Perhaps Cui Dongshan was in a particularly impatient mood today, unwilling to play cat-and-mouse with the sword cultivator. He erected two statues of saints simultaneously in the east and south.

The sword cultivator gritted his teeth and suddenly charged straight toward the dome of the little world.

At the peak of Donghua Mountain, the tallest divine statue loomed, representing the old Confucian figure of the Great Li’s state master, Cui Zhan. It stretched out a golden hand, directly grasping the Nascent Soul sword cultivator. Once it tightened its grip, it rumbled like thunder in the palm of a divine being.

A white-clad youth stood on the shoulder of the ancient tiger statue, looking handsome as jade, rubbing the red mark on his forehead, patiently awaiting the gradual erosion of the Nascent Soul cultivator’s cultivation by the abundant spiritual energy of Donghua Mountain.

Of course, if the old fellow was willing to gamble everything and explode his golden dan and Nascent Soul, Cui Dongshan wouldn’t stop him; after all, what was lost would only be the literary fortune and spiritual energy of Donghua Mountain.

Cui Dongshan still hoped to squeeze a little profit from the hands of this Nascent Soul cultivator, such as… that life sword temporarily trapped within the immortal shell.

Cui Dongshan turned to glance back at the little courtyard.

That white deer was indeed the spirit companion of the old scholar Zhao She, though it had been enchanted by a higher being.

As for the old Confucian caught in the golden statue’s grip, he was certainly not Zhao She.

While Zhao She was a mountain master of a secular academy, his physical condition lacked the aptitude for cultivation; his knowledge was insufficient to reach the heavenly-human resonance realm. One day, upon reading to the point of enlightenment alongside a sage, he wouldn’t suddenly transform into a rare Nascent Soul sword cultivator. In the Baoping Continent, Nascent Soul sword cultivators were exceedingly few.

This pitiful Earth Immortal who failed in his assassination attempt, even if Cui Dongshan were to guess with his rear end or knee, he would know he was not a native cultivator of the Baoping Continent.

More likely, he was one of the death warriors accompanying the newly appointed top scholar of the Great Sui, Zhang Dai.

Those who moved secretly across the world under various identities were often accompanied by one or two high-level cultivators serving as death warriors.

Cui Dongshan sat cross-legged, clicking his tongue, “You little brat ran pretty fast. Killing two birds with one stone, quite a clever plan—got both the Great Li’s Song clan and the Great Sui’s Gao clan involved. You’ve got my old flair. We really should have a good chat. Think about it, you almost thwarted my grand plans. If I don’t seal your spirit into a woman’s body, I won’t share your surname! And it must be a virgin! You should realize that for a big man to bleed without tears, it doesn’t necessarily make him a hero.”

Cui Dongshan seemed to ramble, but half his attention was on the sword in the statue’s hand, while the other half was on the fire sword within Shi Rou.

For these death warriors who revealed themselves, there was no need for any severe torture; they wouldn’t carry any items that could leak information.

Cui Dongshan had to keep a close watch on that fire sword, after all.

While he possessed countless treasures, who in the world would ever complain about having too much money?

Even without a life sword to wield, the Nascent Soul sword cultivator still held formidable combat strength. With his Yang God’s external body, he shattered the golden statue’s fist, then his Yin God emerged, with the three entities each choosing a direction to flee.

Among them, the one who was severely injured and appeared to be running the slowest—his true physical body—suddenly made a swift arc, rapidly descending, landing in the little courtyard, still unwilling to give up on the assassination.

Cui Dongshan, still on the shoulder of the divine statue, sighed, “Competing with me in schemes and plots? You little rascal have truly seen your ancestor; you ought to bow your head in respect.”

The Yin God of the distant travel realm was struck into powder by a corresponding Confucian saint’s statue, and the dispersing spiritual energy served as a form of compensation for Donghua Mountain.

The Yang God’s external body was then struck into the academy’s lake by another saint’s golden body statue, which stomped down, creating massive waves and shattering that external body.

The old Nascent Soul cultivator, already lacking spirit and with no flying sword to control, was about to shatter a golden dan, intending to take the entire courtyard down with him.

But then he suddenly froze.

The fire sword “Golden Autumn,” which Cui Dongshan had won in a bet during a chess match years ago, pierced into the old man’s golden dan, shattering it.

Then strange, black-gold characters began to crawl across the old man’s body, somewhat different from the golden characters of righteousness that filled the Haoran realm when Mao Xiaodong was in charge of the little world.

Cui Dongshan stood before the old man, swiped at his face, and peeled off a blood-soaked, high-quality Mo family secret “mask.” He then stripped away the layer of flesh that belonged to the old man’s true face, shaking it off to remove blood and scraps of flesh, tucking it into his sleeve. He looked up at the terrifying “face” with visible bones and chuckled, “Thanks, helped me make a little profit.”

The old man could no longer speak. His skin shattered like tightly packed porcelain, and even his eyeballs were filled with cracks and broken. All that remained was the violent turbulence of hatred and resentment deep within his soul.

Cui Dongshan widened his eyes, stepped forward, and stared into the old man’s eyes. “What’s wrong, do you want to kill me with your gaze? Come, come, I’ll give you a chance!”

Moments later, Cui Dongshan flicked his finger against the old man’s forehead, and although his life had already been extinguished, the old man flew backward, turning into a downpour of blood in mid-air.

Cui Dongshan stood in the courtyard and walked toward the main house, passing by the fallen Xie Xie, and muttered in annoyance, “Useless thing.”

He kicked Xie Xie, sending her crashing into the wall.

Yu Lu stood in place, a bitter smile on his face.

Cui Dongshan brushed past him, saying irritably, “I don’t even care to talk about you.”

As he approached the steps, Cui Dongshan suddenly slapped his forehead, remembering that his master was about to arrive with Mao Xiaodong. He hastily grabbed Xie Xie’s form and “placed” her in the green bamboo corridor. Cui Dongshan then ran over, squatting in front of her and rubbing her face.

In the end, she transformed into a smiling Xie Xie.

Cui Dongshan looked at his handiwork, somewhat satisfied but increasingly annoyed. He slapped Xie Xie’s face, waking her up, and before she could speak in a daze, he slapped her again, knocking her out, “That previous smile was much more pleasing to the eye.”

Another round of fuss ensued.

Xie Xie continued to maintain her smiling seated position.

Cui Dongshan confirmed that Shi Rou, who was unconscious, had the fire sword in her abdomen still vibrating sorrowfully, making it temporarily impossible for it to escape its cage.

Only then did he raise both hands and clap loudly.

He dispelled the little world of Donghua Mountain’s academy.

Zhu Lian returned to the courtyard, sitting beside a stone bench, looking down at his abdomen with some regret. The Nascent Soul sword cultivator had been bound, while his injury wasn’t severe enough. It seemed both sides hadn’t fought to their heart’s content.

Cui Dongshan hurried into the main house, knocking on the study door, ingratiatingly saying, “Little Baoping, guess who I am?”

———

What began as a covert assassination plot, one that not only caught Cai Fengmiao and the others off guard but even the Emperor of the Great Sui, concluded in this manner.

The academy’s staff began to systematically clean up the aftermath after Mao Xiaodong conveyed his thoughts to several deputy mountain masters and old Confucians.

At the academy gate, Mao Xiaodong and Chen Pingan walked side by side down the hillside.

Mao Xiaodong smiled, “One day, you will be able to protect those you care about, sheltering them within that courtyard, while the storms outside and the changing landscapes cannot harm them in the slightest. Of course, when they grow up and leave that courtyard, unless someone is being unreasonable, the younger generation should face their own tribulations—let them suffer the hardships they need to, cry when they must, and bleed when they must. Otherwise, no matter how old they get, they will never truly grow up.”

Mao Xiaodong sighed, “As parents, as teachers, we cannot care for anyone for a lifetime, nor can even the most learned sage tend to all the sentient beings of the Haoran realm. It’s beyond our capacity.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “That’s the truth.”

Mao Xiaodong felt a surge of anger at the thought of soon meeting that surname Cui.

After a long silence while walking along the dilapidated road outside the little courtyard, Mao Xiaodong suddenly voiced something that surprised Chen Pingan.

“I believe that the places in this world that can least afford to have issues are not on the dragon throne or even in the mountains. They are in the classrooms of all sizes. If something goes wrong here, it’s hard to save.”

“Those poor scholars, whose hopes for fame seem hopeless, and the teachers who might hear the crowing of roosters every day, determine the future of a nation.”

“Cui Dongshan, or rather Cui Zhan, has done countless impressive or unscrupulous things behind the scenes in the Great Li Dynasty. In my view, only one thing cannot be criticized, even by the most learned sage.”

“The state master Cui Zhan has adhered to the principle of ‘When a country is about to prosper, it must honor teachers and respect education’ in the Great Li Dynasty. For this reason, he has introduced many policies that favor teachers and has personally overseen local officials, incorporating this matter into the evaluation of officials’ promotions. This is what a true state master should be like.”

The Great Sui lost out in most scholars’ relative negligence, while the so-called barbaric Great Li not only had a strong military but also excelled in practical governance, even among scholars.

Finally, Mao Xiaodong halted, saying, “Though there are suspicions of petty behavior, I must still voice my thoughts. Now that Cui Dongshan’s fate is intertwined with you on the path of the Great Dao, who in the world would harm himself? Ultimately, he seeks a closer connection with Cui Zhan. Although it’s destined to never fully merge, you must still be cautious of that old bastard and that little brat. They harbor malicious intent and are the sort who feel uncomfortable if they don’t scheme against others for even a day.”

At the gate of the little courtyard, Cui Dongshan, still bearing the red seal on his forehead, was jumping up and down, cursing loudly, “Mao Xiaodong, did I dig up your ancestors’ graves or steal your wife? How dare you sow discord between our teacher-student relationship?!”

Mao Xiaodong waved her sleeve, reclaiming the jade token that Cui Dongshan had hidden away. “Make the most of what we have. You, me, and Chen Pingan should go back to the study and revisit our chess game. Things may not end here.”

Cui Dongshan was about to unleash a torrent of curses at Mao Xiaodong when, the next moment, the three of them appeared in the study.

Once seated, Cui Dongshan surprisingly didn’t linger on the matter, leaving Mao Xiaodong somewhat astonished.

Mao Xiaodong roughly recounted the events at the Temple of Literature and the assassination.

Chen Pingan occasionally chimed in for clarification.

After finishing, Cui Dongshan stared blankly at Mao Xiaodong.

Mao Xiaodong glared, “Watch your tone.”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “Didn’t Yuan Gaofeng already tell you all the answers? It’s just that your perspective is too narrow, not much better than Wei Xian. Yuan Gaofeng has good intentions and daring; he only fell short of telling you the truth directly. How could you not grasp it? Didn’t Yuan Gaofeng call you out for bartering and using merchant tricks, thus slandering the scholarly way?”

Mao Xiaodong furrowed her brows, “Is there really a merchant involved? Wanting chaos in the world?”

Cui Dongshan sneered, “There’s more than that. There’s a fellow using Zhang Dai’s identity who has been lurking in the Great Sui for many years, likely a direct descendant of a major strategist, participating in a secret grand examination.”

Mao Xiaodong queried, “Are there two groups of assassins? Didn’t they agree to work together? How could they navigate so stealthily and seize the timing so precisely? Not to mention, just with me and Chen Pingan serving as bait…”

Cui Dongshan mocked, “Are you saying bad people can’t have clever ones among them?”

Mao Xiaodong’s mood grew heavy. She waved her hand, “Your turn.”

Cui Dongshan coughed a few times, cleared his throat, and turned to ask, “Xiao Dong, don’t you have any tea to drink?”

Ignoring him, Mao Xiaodong closed her eyes, deep in thought.

Cui Dongshan sighed, smiling at Chen Pingan, “Excuse me, sir, while I share some of my crude insights.”

Mao Xiaodong couldn’t bear to listen any longer, shouting, “You little bastard! Have some self-respect, and stop being disgusting!”

Chen Pingan smiled, “You’ll get used to it.”

Cui Dongshan, proud of himself, glanced at Mao Xiaodong. “I didn’t expect that since coming from the Great Li to the Great Sui, you’ve improved quite a bit. Seems like spending time with me has rubbed off on you; you’re already preparing for the mountain-moving business early on, taking advantage of the timing, geography, and opportunity. Not only do you know to eliminate the key array master first, or else if that military cultivator detonated his golden dan during the ambush, you’d likely have been done for. If you die, that’s fine, but if my master suffers even a hair’s worth of damage, I’ll spit on your corpse…”

As a result, Cui Dongshan received a kick from Chen Pingan, who said, “Get to the point.”

Cui Dongshan immediately sat up, half-bowing respectfully, saying, “As you wish, sir.”

Mao Xiaodong closed her eyes again, choosing not to see.

After a moment of gathering his thoughts, Cui Dongshan stood up, walking around the chair, and began to speak slowly, “This layout roughly divides into four levels of characters and realms.”

Cui Dongshan raised one finger. “First.”

“The descendants of Cai Jing, the Great Sui’s worshippers, such as Cai Feng, hold minor positions. However, as they grow in number, they can stir public opinion in the court significantly, hoping to leave a mark in history while secretly admiring the style of the founding Confucian generals. Cai Feng is one of the better ones, having a Nascent Soul ancestor. He harbors immense ambitions, aiming for a posthumous title of ‘Wenzheng.’

The rest, with their scholar-spirited bravado, are often uninformed fools regarding worldly matters. If they truly achieve something significant, it’s sheer luck. If not, they’re not afraid of death; after all, what’s a noble death if they can casually discuss their temperament? They can die gallantly, but they appear as if both life and death are monumental.”

“Whether they leave behind a mess and how rotten it becomes isn’t their concern, for they can’t even imagine such things. They’ve read about tragedies where people are slaughtered and sold, but it’s merely a story to them.”

“I’ve seen quite a few, in fact.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “Of course, sir, you must have seen plenty in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.”

Cui Dongshan raised a second finger. “Second.”

“Guo Xin, the Left Assistant Minister of Rites, and generals like Miao Ren, descendants of powerful clans, have long resided in the capital under the Great Sui’s peace. They seem glorious but actually hold empty titles, treating the court as a cage. They yearn to carry forward the legacy of their ancestors’ valor on the battlefield. Additionally, they have numerous connections with influential military generals at the borders, echoing with Miao Ren.”

“Then there’s Tao Jiu, the Right Assistant Minister of War, and Song Shan, the deputy commander responsible for the capital’s security. They are relatively pragmatic and familiar with military affairs. After the sudden death of the Great Sui’s emperor, Song Zhengchun, this is a rare opportunity that must not be missed. They plan to tear up treaties and exploit the pent-up rage of the entire nation, aiming for a gamble. They refuse to sit idle and allow the rising Great Li to, through gradual assimilation, replace their dynasty entirely. Such people arrive at their conclusions after weighing the pros and cons. Compared to Guo Xin and Miao Ren, they are somewhat more astute, but they still operate at a similar level. The Great Sui's essence lies in having such individuals in the court and at the borders, which can barely count as a nation's strength.”

Cui Dongshan raised a third finger. “Third, now we come to that poor emperor of the Great Sui.”

“This person is in the most awkward position. He originally prepared to shoulder the blame, pushing through the opposition to sign a humiliating treaty, even sending the highly regarded prince Gao Xuan to the Piyun Mountain Forest Deer Academy as a hostage. Yet he still underestimated the surging tides in the court; Cai Feng and the others conspired to assassinate the academy’s Mao Xiaodong. If successful, they would label her as a spy for the Great Li, spreading rumors to the public that Mao Xiaodong harbored malicious intent, attempting to undermine the Great Sui’s literary foundation through the Mountain Cliff Academy. This kind of scheming literary demon would surely be loathed by the citizens of the Great Sui.”

Mao Xiaodong did not refute anything.

A literary demon?

He felt that was an exaggeration.

Who was once the most notorious literary demon of the Haoran realm? That would be his mentor, Cui Zhan.

Cui Dongshan grinned, “Of course, the Great Sui Emperor might be aware of Cai Feng and their scheming, or he might not, the latter being more likely since he’s currently not in favor with the public. However, this doesn’t matter, for Cai Feng and his ilk don’t realize that whether Mao Xiaodong lives or dies is of little concern to the Great Li’s Song clan. The Great Sui Emperor, on the other hand, cares more about this. Regardless, he won’t break that mountain alliance treaty. That’s something Cai Feng and his group fail to consider. However, those like Cai Feng surely wish to eliminate Mao Xiaodong first, then clean up Baoping, Li Huai, and Lin Shouyi, the Great Li scholars. But at that time, the Great Sui Emperor would not plan to tear up the treaty and would definitely intervene. But…”

Cui Dongshan’s smile turned cold, “With Song Zhengchun dead, it seems the Great Sui Emperor has indeed been stirred. As an emperor, does he really want to endure the blame from the court and the public? Would he willingly remain a subject under others, surrounded by the Great Li’s iron cavalry or the Song clan's vassals, hiding away and barely surviving? Tao Jiu and Song Shan can see the opportunity; the Great Sui Emperor isn’t a fool and can see further.”

“This person sits on that throne, observing the antics of Cai Feng and the others. How to put it? It’s a mix of joy and sorrow, not purely disappointment and anger. The joy lies in the fact that the Gao clan has nurtured scholars for hundreds of years, and undoubtedly, countless people would be willing to repay the Gao clan with their lives. The sorrow lies in the Great Sui Emperor having no confidence in winning a gamble; once he openly tears up the treaty, there would be no room for maneuvering between the two nations. If he were to suffer defeat, the Great Sui’s territory would undoubtedly bear the wrath of the Great Li’s court.”

Cui Dongshan held up three fingers, smiling. “When I persuaded Song Changjing not to attack the Great Sui, it took a lot of effort. Song Changjing was furious and had a heated argument with the Emperor, claiming it was raising a tiger to harm and treating the lives of the Great Li soldiers as a joke. It was quite amusing, a martial artist loudly reprimanding the Emperor with a scholar’s rhetoric.”

“At that time, our emperor was secretly concealing from everyone that his lifespan was nearing its end, not ten years, but three. He was probably worried about the Mo family and Yin-Yang family cultivators; even that old bastard was likely kept in the dark. In the end, it proved that the Emperor was correct. The Yin-Yang family’s Lu cultivator indeed had sinister intentions, aiming to make him a puppet with a clouded mind step by step. If it weren’t for A Liang interrupting our Emperor’s long life bridge, the Great Li Song clan might have caused the greatest joke on Baoping Continent.”

Cui Dongshan squinted, raising a fourth finger, “Then we come to the backstage figures, divided into two groups.”

“The real high-level individuals, I suspect, are from the merchant and strategist families. They don’t take unnecessary actions, not targeting Mao Xiaodong, nor you, sir, nor anyone; they are merely going with the flow, enticing the Great Sui Emperor with benefits, planning to replace the Great Li. Not to mention the half of the continent that the Great Li cavalry has already trampled over, even half of the continent would be enough for the ancestors of the Great Sui Gao clan to laugh in their graves.”

“The most interesting part, however, is not this group of top-tier figures but the fellow who knocked out Zhao She, the disciple of the Sage Lu, using the identity of the new top scholar, Zhang Dai. He has been hiding among Cai Feng’s ranks. Afterward, he left the city overnight. Both the Great Sui and the Great Li would like to scour the land, yet no one could find him. Just like I mentioned earlier, the strategist’s lineage is using this scheme as a practical trial.”

“What makes Zhang Dai clever?”

“To put it plainly, as long as the Great Sui Emperor is persuaded by this first group of backstage figures to go all in, whether Mao Xiaodong dies or not, it won’t change the overall situation. If he hesitates, then after Zhang Dai causes such a huge mess, the Great Sui Emperor would truly have no choice but to go down a dark path. Then Zhang Dai can just wash his hands of the matter, and the entire situation of the Baoping Continent would change because of him.”

“For cultivators, wantonly killing an earthly monarch leads to a change of regime, which is a huge taboo, and it’s for the Confucian sages to clean up. But to manipulate public sentiment, cultivate puppets, whether by imprisoning or sidelining the emperor, or to have a hand in the matter, the Confucian academy would merely record it quietly in their files. The severity of the consequences? That depends on how high the Qi practitioner climbs—falling from a great height means a heavier fall. If they can’t climb high, it’s a twist of fate.”

Cui Dongshan retracted his four fingers, lightly clenching his fists, smiling, “The reason for laying out so much is not just to help Xiao Dong clarify her doubts, but there’s something even more important.”

Cui Dongshan sat back in his chair, adopting a serious demeanor. “Breaking through to the upper Five Realms as a Nascent Soul cultivator, the essence lies in the two words ‘Harmonizing Dao.’”

“I share these thoughts with you, hoping you will view this world with a more comprehensive and profound understanding, to grasp the rules that govern the heavens and earth today, and to know which lines are untouchable and which can be broken and rebuilt. Once rebuilt, that’s ‘Harmonizing Dao’! Being recognized by the Haoran realm’s orthodoxy, even if the Confucian academies and sages don’t acknowledge it, they will have to begrudgingly accept it! Because the Most Sage and the Rites Sage recognize it!”

Chen Pingan fell into deep thought.

Cui Dongshan moved to the window, gazing at the mountain scenery, suddenly turning back with a smile, “Sir, I have a question I hope you can help me clarify.”

Chen Pingan raised his head with a smile, “Go ahead.”

Mao Xiaodong seemed to doze off, but she was actually on high alert.

Cui Dongshan asked, “If one pursues a correct result through incorrect methods, is it right or wrong?”

Chen Pingan chuckled.

He had discussed this matter with Liu Qingfeng.

Cui Dongshan continued, “Then, if incorrect methods lead to an extremely rare correct result, does that still count as wrong?”

(End of Chapter)### Chapter 412: I Need to Think Again

In the study, the sound of a pin dropping could be heard.

Chen Ping'an was pondering two questions, his hand instinctively reaching for the sword gourd containing the rice wine from the alley, but he quickly released it.

Cui Dongshan did not rush him.

Mao Xiaodong was idly stroking the ruler in her hand.

Chen Ping'an spoke up, “I don’t have an answer yet. I need to think.”

Cui Dongshan nodded with a brilliant smile, “No rush. Ask whatever you like, and the teacher will answer as he pleases.”

Chen Ping'an stood to take his leave, while Cui Dongshan decided to stay behind and chat with Mao Xiaodong about the upcoming situation in the Great Sui capital.

As Chen Ping'an reached the door, he turned around and pointed at Cui Dongshan's forehead. “Aren't you going to wipe that off?”

Cui Dongshan looked momentarily blank before quickly wiping the red seal from his forehead, his face turning slightly red as he said, “It's been a while since I left the academy; I've grown a bit out of touch with the Little Treasure Bottle. It wasn’t like this before; every time it saw me, it was particularly amiable.”

Chen Ping'an closed the door, and his footsteps slowly faded away down the corridor.

Cui Dongshan tiptoed to the door, pressing his ear against it, and suddenly burst out laughing.

Straightening up, he spread his arms wide and began to sway back and forth, his sleeves billowing like waves as he joyfully exclaimed, “No more getting scolded or beaten!”

Mao Xiaodong looked at the grinning fellow and asked, “When you were under the teacher, you weren't like this at all. When I heard Qi Jingchun talk about the first time he met you in the Great Li, it sounded like you were quite serious back then, always putting on airs?”

Cui Dongshan leaped up, hanging in the air for a moment, then bent forward, striking a pose like a duck on water, and began to swim through the somber study in a dog-paddle style, muttering, “When I tricked the old scholar into the door, I was already in my early twenties. If I remember correctly, it took me three years just to sneak out from Treasure Bottle Continent and wander to the shabby alley where the old scholar was. I encountered many bumps along the way and endured quite a bit of hardship. Who would have thought that three years later, instead of enjoying the fruits of my labor, I’d fall into the biggest pit, worrying day in and day out, struggling to make ends meet, fearing that one day we’d starve to death? Could my mindset compare to what it is now? Can you imagine me and the old scholar, both of us with our little stools, starving, sitting in the sun at the door, counting the meager days until the Cui family sent over the silver? Can you imagine us digging for worms to fish when a ferry capsized? That’s how the old scholar came up with that quote that made the world’s earthworms grateful?”

“So you see, the old scholar’s knowledge was born from hunger. This is what they call ‘the article bears the mark of fate.’ Look at how many good articles he produced after he gained fame. Some were good, sure, but in terms of quantity and depth, they weren’t nearly as good as before. It can’t be helped; he got busy later on, participating in debates among the Three Teachings, being warmly invited by the grand tutor of the academy, and having the sect leader of the academy cry and beg him to preach and teach. He crushed the golden body of a great mountain deity with his own name, then ran off to the celestial realm to throw a tantrum by Dao Lao Er, begging others to kill him so he could fish out those broken blessed lands from the river of time. These were all big matters, and the small ones were even more numerous than the cows. Going to old friends’ taverns to drink, chatting, exchanging letters, arguing on paper—who has time to write articles?”

Mao Xiaodong scoffed, “Stop flaunting your old stories here, you ungrateful brat, and don’t try to reminisce about your school days.”

Cui Dongshan floated in the air, circling around the upright Mao Xiaodong’s chair leisurely, “Xiao Dong, your heart is good; you’re worried I’ll collude with that old bastard Wang to scheme against our teacher, so you’re busy trying to ‘block rather than unblock’ for the teacher concerning the matter of the Heart Lake. But you know, your foundation in knowledge is ultimately a bit thin. Still, I have to thank you. I, Cui Dongshan, am no longer that kind of scholar who’s sweet-talking on the surface but wielding a knife behind the scenes. If I think well of you, I’ll genuinely help you kill that Yuanying Sword Cultivator. The academy’s building isn’t even significantly damaged. If you were in charge of the academy, could you have done that? Could you have ensured the literary fortunes of Donghua Mountain remained unbroken?”

Mao Xiaodong chuckled, “Then I should thank your parents for birthing such a kind soul like you?”

Cui Dongshan flipped over, assuming a duck-like pose on his back, and angrily said, “Argue if you want, insult me if you want, but bringing up my parents and ancestors is not a skill!”

Mao Xiaodong clicked her tongue, “After you betrayed your master and roamed the Middle Earth, what schemes did you get up to and what dirty words did you say? Don’t you have any self-awareness? I’ve only learned a little from you.”

Cui Dongshan landed gracefully, laughing, “Xiao Dong, you’re not my disciple, so what’s the point of learning from me? If you want to pay to learn, I wouldn’t mind teaching you. Otherwise, let me tell you, when scholars steal knowledge, it’s still stealing!”

Suddenly, Mao Xiaodong stood up and walked to the window, her brow furrowed, and in the blink of an eye, Cui Dongshan disappeared along with her.

The two stood atop the great tree at Donghua Mountain, where Mao Xiaodong asked, “I can only vaguely sense some uncertain signs through the literary fortunes of the Great Sui, but it’s hard to really pin them down. Do you know who the mastermind is? Can you name names?”

Cui Dongshan sat on a high branch, pulling out a piece of face skin made by the Mo family’s mechanicians using yin-yang techniques, admiring it as if it were the top treasure for bandits and cultivators, sure to fetch a sky-high price. He mockingly replied to Mao Xiaodong’s question, “I advise you not to overreach; they aren’t targeting anyone specifically, and they’re already giving a lot of face. You, Mao Xiaodong, aren’t some Great Sui Emperor. The academy doesn’t have the title of ‘One of the Seventy-Two’ anymore. If you happen to bump into a ‘Upper-Class’ grandmaster from the Hundred Schools, and they act according to their own principles, you might as well be asking for death. The Middle Earth Academy won’t help you clear your name. History isn’t without such tragedies.”

Mao Xiaodong coldly laughed, “The School of Diplomacy is indeed among the elite, but that Merchant School doesn’t even rank among the Hundred Schools. If it weren’t for the Sage of Rites advocating for them back then, they would’ve almost been expelled from the Hundred Schools by the line of the Sub-Sages.”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “You’re only seeing the surface; have you ever thought about why the rarely visible Sage of Rites broke his usual silence? Do you think it’s because he craved the Merchant School’s offerings?”

Mao Xiaodong fumed, “Cui Dongshan, don’t insult the Saint of Merit!”

It was rare for Mao Xiaodong to call him by his full name, yet Cui Dongshan remained unflustered. “Since you hold the Sage of Rites in such high regard, why didn’t you switch sides when the old scholar fell? The Sage of Rites’ lineage sought you out, did they not? Why follow Qi Jingchun to the Great Li and establish an academy right under my nose? Isn’t that just a mutual annoyance? What’s the point? If you had switched to the literary lineage, you would’ve already been a true Jade Purity Realm cultivator. The rumors in the Jianghu say the old scholar said to convince you to take a position at the Liji Academy, ‘Hurry and secure a spot at the academy; if your teacher doesn’t fare well in the future, at least you can come to me for a meal.’ Even such words came from the old scholar’s mouth, and you still didn’t go? How did that turn out? Now, within Confucianism, you, Mao Xiaodong, are still just a sage title. On the path of cultivation, you’ve made no progress and wasted a hundred years of time.”

Mao Xiaodong muttered, “For a cultivator, is the level of realm really that important?”

She answered her own question, “Of course, it’s very important. But for me, Mao Xiaodong, it’s not the most important thing, so choosing between the two isn’t difficult at all.”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “Fool.”

Mao Xiaodong’s expression darkened, “You little brat, say that again?!”

Cui Dongshan gauged the situation and felt that if a fight broke out, he would definitely be pinned to the ground by Mao Xiaodong, who was bound to regain her jade token. In a confined space, it was disadvantageous for a Qi practitioner against magical treasures and formations.

So, he cheerfully shifted the topic. “Do you really think there’s no trickery among the Great Li envoys attending the Great Sui Thousand Elders Banquet?”

Mao Xiaodong asked, “What do you mean?”

Cui Dongshan produced a folding fan with text on both sides and gently waved it, “To thoroughly crush the luck of the Ge family and teach the Great Sui to keep their promises and nestle back for a hundred years.”

Mao Xiaodong questioned, “If this mastermind is as powerful as you say, would they be willing to sit down and have a good talk? Even the Daoist Celestial Lord Xie Shi from Beiju Luzhou might not have such weight.”

Mao Xiaodong quickly nodded, “The heroic figure Xu Ruo. Being able to persuade the mainline of the Mo family and its side branches to set aside past grievances and fully back the Great Li, Xu Ruo is indeed quite remarkable.”

Cui Dongshan shook the folding fan with a flourish, “Xiao Dong, I’m not exaggerating; you’re getting smarter by the day, spending time with me truly makes a difference, just like how one becomes fragrant from staying in a Zhi Lan room.”

Mao Xiaodong glanced at Cui Dongshan and wrote the four characters “To Win People with Virtue” on the fan.

Cui Dongshan shot her a glance, “Not convinced?”

Mao Xiaodong smiled, “If I’m not convinced, what’s your argument? Do enlighten me.”

Cui Dongshan turned the fan around to reveal another four characters, which was probably the answer. Upon seeing them, Mao Xiaodong laughed, “Unconvinced and beaten to death.”

With a flick of her sleeve, she sent Cui Dongshan crashing into the lake at the foot of the mountain.

Despite intentionally not dodging, Cui Dongshan spun gracefully in mid-air, drawing circles that grew wider, until the entire lake looked as if it had been blanketed with fresh snow, resembling a heavy snowstorm.

Cui Dongshan floated above the lake, standing by the shore, admiring the somewhat wintry scene that had descended upon summer, feeling quite pleased with himself. He nodded, “Well done! I’m impressed!”

---

Chen Ping'an arrived at Cui Dongshan’s courtyard.

Zhu Lian had already bandaged his wounds. Despite a faint scent of blood lingering, he was casually chatting as he sat on the steps with Li Huai and Pei Qian, recounting the thrilling and moving details of the recent battle.

Lin Shouyi was stabilizing his mind and Qi, which was a bit grueling, but his repeated excursions into the river of time were beneficial for any cultivator, as long as no lasting damage was left behind, especially helpful for breaking through to the Golden Core realm.

Xie Qing was pale and had sustained some serious injuries, more due to her spirit being tossed around along with the small world and the flowing river of time. Yet, rather than sitting in the green bamboo corridor to recover, she was seated not far from Pei Qian, occasionally glancing toward the courtyard entrance.

Shi Rou had been pulled from the shattered floor by Yu Lu, lying flat in the corridor. She had regained consciousness but was suffering from the turmoil created by a Yuanying Sword Cultivator’s departing fire sword, causing her abdominal pain as she anxiously awaited Cui Dongshan’s return to rescue her from her plight.

Li Baoping squatted next to “Du Mao,” asking curiously, “Pei Qian said I should call you Sister Shi Rou, why is that?”

Shi Rou was about to speak when Li Baoping, perceptively, said, “Let’s chat once the sword in your belly is out.”

Shi Rou could only smile wryly and nod.

Yu Lu was sweeping the courtyard, and his injured hand was already bandaged up.

Chen Ping'an let out a sigh of relief.

On the way here, he had seen the white deer belonging to the old master Zhao Shi. Despite being trapped by the mastermind's secret technique, it still lay stiffly in place.

Chen Ping'an didn’t dare to move it recklessly and left it for Cui Dongshan to handle.

He paused beside Yu Lu, raised his hand, and after taking hold of the sword hilt from behind, bloodied and messy, he applied the hemostatic herbs from the mountains and the healing ointment from the immortal clan, skillfully bandaging it up. He then shook Yu Lu lightly and smiled, “Brothers in misfortune?”

Yu Lu asked with a smile, “How did you get hurt?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “It would be embarrassing to say, so let’s leave it be.”

Turning his gaze to Li Baoping and Pei Qian, he said, “You all can continue playing; nothing should happen now. However, you still need to stay here for a while. Remember, don’t be too unfamiliar in someone else’s home.”

Li Huai said, “Chen Ping'an, what are you talking about? Cui Dongshan is familiar with me. My friend is your friend, and your friend is Pei Qian’s friend. Since we’re all friends, it’s only right to be familiar.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “You can take that twisted logic to someone else.”

Li Huai suddenly turned to Pei Qian, asking, “Pei Qian, do you think my reasoning makes sense?”

Pei Qian decisively replied, “My master is right; it’s nonsense!”

Li Huai lamented, “Pei Qian, I didn’t expect you to be this kind of person. What about the chivalry of the Jianghu? Didn’t we agree to adventure together and dig for treasures? And now, we haven’t even started our Jianghu journey to make big money, and you want to break up?”

Pei Qian laughed, “Once we finish this meal, we can part ways.”

Li Huai rubbed his chin, “That does seem reasonable.”

Chen Ping'an sat down beside Lin Shouyi and quietly asked, “How are you?”

Lin Shouyi sighed, self-deprecatingly saying, “When immortals fight, the ants suffer.”

Chen Ping'an chose not to say anything further.

Lin Shouyi smiled, “When Cui Dongshan comes back, tell him I’ll be here often in the future. Just remember to word it right—that it’s your intention. I only came because of Cui Dongshan’s teachings.”

Chen Ping'an held back a chuckle, as he knew the truth was that Cui Dongshan had invited Lin Shouyi to cultivate here. He said, “You can say it however you like.”

Lin Shouyi lowered his voice, “A favor owed to Cui Dongshan will need to be repaid eventually, and he can decide how to repay it. But a favor owed to you can be repaid as I see fit.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “So this is what you call bullying the weak and fearing the strong?”

Lin Shouyi shook his head, “I call this not bullying the good and fearing the evil.”

Chen Ping'an took out the sword gourd and drank the sweet rice wine inside.

Lin Shouyi asked, “The academy’s library is pretty nice. I’m familiar with it, so if you want to go there to find books, I can show you the way.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I probably won’t go; I can’t take in that much knowledge.”

Lin Shouyi laughed, “At least agree to it, so I can repay you a small favor first. How can you be so ignorant of social customs?”

Chen Ping'an coughed, wiping his mouth before turning to Lin Shouyi, “You’ve been attending a fake academy on the cliff and studied fake sage texts for several years, haven’t you?”

Lin Shouyi burst out laughing.

Pei Qian bumped Li Huai with her elbow and whispered, “Is my master really that close to Lin Shouyi?”

Li Huai didn’t look up, busy fiddling with his painted puppet, casually saying, “Not really. Chen Ping'an is closest to me; his relationships with others aren’t that strong.”

Li Baoping silently approached Li Huai from behind and kicked him, causing him to fall to the ground.

Li Huai sat up with a mournful face, “Li Baoping, if you keep this up, I’ll have to drag Pei Qian and start my own clan and stop recognizing you as the leader of the martial arts world!”

Li Baoping scoffed, looking quite disdainful.

Currently, both Li Huai and Pei Qian found themselves in a unique position; Li Huai had become the small branch leader of the Donghua Mountain branch under the Longquan County headquarters, but he had been expelled before. Afterwards, when Chen Ping'an arrived at the academy, and Li Huai stubbornly guaranteed that he wouldn’t come last in his studies next time, Li Baoping had mercifully reinstated Li Huai’s status in the martial arts world.

As for Pei Qian, Li Baoping had insisted on clear distinctions between public and private matters; with her still being relatively inexperienced, she could only temporarily hang her name as a low-ranking disciple of the academy’s small branch. Pei Qian felt it was quite good, and Li Huai thought it was even better, as it put him a rank higher than Pei Qian, the exiled princess, to the point where Liu Guan and Ma Lian had both become named disciples under the martial arts leader Li Baoping. However, Li Huai’s two classmates, who weren’t interested in the actual meal, were more focused on Pei Qian’s noble status, while Ma Lian, hailing from a prominent family in the Great Sui, blushed and struggled to say a word whenever he saw Li Baoping.

Cui Dongshan swaggered into the courtyard, dragging a poor white deer by one leg and tossing it carelessly onto the ground.

The white deer seemed to have broken the restrictions imposed by Cui Dongshan and returned to its true nature as a spiritual creature, yet its spirit had not fully recovered, appearing somewhat wilted as it slid a distance in the courtyard, letting out a mournful cry.

It lacked the beauty of the poetic “Deer Crying in the Woods.”

Li Huai's eyes widened, incredulous. “Is this really the white deer that belongs to Old Master Zhao? Cui Dongshan, how did you steal or capture this? Is this what we’re having for our meal tonight? That doesn’t seem right, does it?”

Pei Qian nearly drooled, wiping her mouth as she quickly signaled to Li Huai.

Li Huai cleared his throat a few times, “Eating roasted deer meat wouldn’t be too bad; I’ve never had it before.”

Li Huai turned to Chen Ping'an and shouted, “Chen Ping'an, do you have oil and salt with you?!”

Chen Ping'an laughed and scolded, “Eat deer meat? Do you want the academy’s scholars to punish you with a year’s worth of their canes?”

Li Huai blinked, “Cui Dongshan stole it, Chef Zhu killed it, you, Chen Ping'an, roasted it, and I just couldn’t resist the craving and was coaxed by Lin Shouyi into eating a few bites of deer meat. Is that a crime?”

Cui Dongshan suddenly exclaimed and squatted down, staring at the white deer, realizing it was fixated on Li Huai.

Li Huai noticed the situation too, feeling that the deer’s gaze resembled that of a living person, and he felt a bit guilty.

The white deer stood up unsteadily, slowly approaching Li Huai.

Scared, Li Huai turned and scrambled toward the main house on all fours.

The white deer leapt gracefully onto the green bamboo corridor, following Li Huai into the house.

Chen Ping'an looked at Cui Dongshan with confusion.

Cui Dongshan smiled, “No need to worry, teacher. This kid Li Huai has such luck that good fortune can just drop right onto his doorstep. This spiritually aware white deer feels drawn to him. Once Zhao Shi is found by the Great Sui, I’ll speak to him about this, and I’m sure the Cliff Academy will have an additional white deer in the future.”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his forehead.

Truly, he was Li Huai.

Moments later, Li Huai rode the white deer out of the main house, laughing heartily as he boasted to Li Baoping and Pei Qian, “Isn’t this impressive?”

Li Baoping couldn’t be bothered to respond, sitting beside her little master.

Pei Qian nodded, a bit envious, then turned to Chen Ping'an, her eyes pleading, “Master, when can I have a little donkey?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Once we get to Longquan County, I’ll help you see if there’s a suitable one.”

Pei Qian beamed.

Cui Dongshan approached Shi Rou, who was already sitting against the wall in the corridor. It was still difficult for her to get up, and she felt a sense of fear facing Cui Dongshan, not daring to look him in the eye.

Cui Dongshan crouched down, shifting to ensure his back was facing Chen Ping'an.

Just as he was about to speak comforting words and make some moves that would make Shi Rou wish she were dead but leave her unable to voice it, Shi Rou suddenly found herself unable to move, staring at Cui Dongshan’s face, which wore a cold smirk.

Fortunately, Chen Ping'an’s voice drifted from a distance, falling into Shi Rou’s ears like heavenly music, “Take the sword; just take the sword. Don’t make any unnecessary movements.”

Cui Dongshan frowned, sighing.

Chen Ping'an sat there, slowly sipping his wine, watching the somewhat crowded small courtyard. Compared to his earlier travels in the Great Sui, this time he had Zhu Lian and Pei Qian, plus Shi Rou, though he was missing a certain swordsman with a hat and a knife.

Chen Ping'an collected his thoughts and suddenly looked at Cui Dongshan’s back, saying, “I need to think again.”

Cui Dongshan, engrossed in subduing the departing fire sword that was now hiding in the remnants of an immortal’s shed, seemed not to have heard this statement.
