 ### Chapter 551: Since Ancient Times, Drunkards Have Been the Hardest to Sober

On the second floor, the old man Cui Cheng remained barefoot. However, today he was not sitting cross-legged as usual; instead, he closed his eyes in concentration, practicing a strange boxing stance that Chen Ping’an had never seen before. With each palm and punch, one high and one low, Chen Ping’an chose not to disturb the old man’s practice. He removed his straw hat, hesitated briefly, and even took off his sword immortal hat, quietly sitting beside him.

Cui Cheng opened his eyes, maintaining his stance, and spoke slowly, “In all the world’s boxing techniques, it’s all about hardness and softness. My boxing style can be considered the epitome of hardness. Back in the day, as I traveled far and wide, I encountered many soft boxing styles, but I have never seen a style worthy of being called ‘the softest.’”

Chen Ping’an pondered for a moment before replying, “Beyond the boxing manuals and stances, the mind and character must also resonate. Compared to the boxing techniques of the old master, if we disregard the question of who’s superior or inferior in boxing, simply aiming to reach the realm of ultimate softness is likely more challenging. The Taoist disciples training on the mountain might be more inclined to practice boxing, while pure martial artists from the rivers and lakes find it exceedingly difficult. The stance must rise from below, and the intention must flow from within. Without the right mindset, you’ll never reach the pinnacle.”

Cui Cheng retracted his stance and nodded, “That’s a fair point. It seems your understanding of boxing principles is slightly stronger than that of a mere child.”

Chen Ping’an found this to be a common occurrence; trying to elicit a single piece of wisdom from this old man was as difficult as the time when Zheng Dafeng tried to engage Yang the Elder in conversation for more than ten words.

Cui Cheng then sat down, gazing at the young man. 

After returning from Shujian Lake, combined with his earlier practice in this building and a journey through the central region of Baoping Continent, Chen Ping’an was no longer the emaciated figure with sunken cheeks. Instead, he exuded an aura of vitality. The depth in his eyes reminded one of an ancient well; if the well was dry, it would be pitch black, but if it was full, one would find it even harder to discern what lay at the bottom.

Cui Cheng inquired, “If given another chance, with time flowing backward and your mindset unchanged, how would you deal with Gu Can? Would you kill him or not?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I still wouldn’t kill him.”

Cui Cheng frowned, “Why not? Killing him would leave you unburdened by heaven and earth. That kind of discomfort, even if buried deep within, can lead you to strike harder and faster in the future. Only by harboring great sorrow and anger can one have great ambitions. To hesitate is to dull the blade of one’s spirit. Killing Gu Can would not only end the mistake but also save you trouble. Afterward, you could still make amends; you’d continue doing what you were doing before, and would Gu Can be able to do it better than you? Chen Ping’an! I ask you, why is it that others die under your fists and swords for their misdeeds, yet Gu Can, who has received your kindness, cannot die?!”

The old man’s tone grew heavier, his words more forceful. By the end, Cui Cheng’s imposing presence felt like a mountain pressing down. Strangely enough, he clearly harbored no martial intent; he was not even on par with a tenth realm martial artist but rather resembled a venerable scholar in a Confucian robe.

“Unburdened by heaven and earth? You, who are no better than a commoner from Mud Bottle Lane, are you worthy to wield a sword and traverse the world on behalf of this realm?” 

Chen Ping’an tugged at the corner of his mouth, a hint of mockery in his voice. “To uphold righteousness and slay kin at Shujian Lake? Is it that difficult to kill Gu Can and then just walk away? Yes, it is indeed difficult. But is it as hard as spending three years in Shujian Lake? No. Did my choice not make the world of Shujian Lake even slightly better? It did. After Gu Can survives and compensates for his wrongdoings, will his nature change, leading him to commit further evils and continue to be a detriment to the future? I’m not certain, but I’m watching. Even if I travel far to Beiju Lu Continent, it’s not just Yanzhi and Ma Duyi who are observing; Liu Zhimao on Qingxia Island, Liu Laocheng on Gongliu Island, and Yiran at Chishui City are all watching.”

The old man seemed increasingly dissatisfied with this answer, his frustration mounting. He glared at Chen Ping’an, his fists resting on his knees, body leaning slightly forward as he narrowed his eyes and spoke in a low voice, “Difficult or not, how you view Gu Can is one thing. Right now, I’m asking you about your true heart! Is there truly no distinction between personal relations? You spare Gu Can today, but in the future, how will you deal with Pei Qian from the Fallen Down Mountain, Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, Li Baoping from the academy, or even me, Cui Cheng, if we were to commit evil deeds?”

Chen Ping’an maintained his composure, “I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.”

Cui Cheng pressed further, “Then what is your current doubt?”

“After speaking with Wei Ban, I have one less doubt.”

Chen Ping’an responded, “So now I’m just thinking about how to become the strongest martial artist and how to cultivate into a sword immortal.”

Cui Cheng shook his head, “A child carrying a heavy basket, not much future in that.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “In that case, I humbly request the old master to live for another hundred or thousand years, and we’ll see who’s right then.”

Cui Cheng glanced at the door that Chen Ping’an had intentionally left ajar and teased, “From the way you entered, you hardly seem bold enough to say such words.”

Chen Ping’an patted his belly, “Some big talk is hard to hold back when the situation calls for it.”

Cui Cheng nodded, “Still feeling cheeky.”

Chen Ping’an suddenly asked, “Old master, do you think I’m a good person?”

Cui Cheng nodded, “Yes.”

For being chivalrous and showing kindness without seeking repayment, he could be considered a good person.

Chen Ping’an followed up, “Do you think I’m a moral sage?”

Cui Cheng shot him a glance, “You seem like one.”

Chen Ping’an turned to look outside, smiling, “It appears that there are indeed too many clever people in this world.”

Cui Cheng burst into hearty laughter, clearly pleased, as if he had been waiting for Chen Ping’an to say this.

Chen Ping’an continued, “The old Daoist from Donghai Guan Dao Temple has been endlessly trying to instill his theories in me, along with my extensive studies of Buddhist logic and Confucian principles. Of course, I also pondered over the contributions of National Master Cui Cheng. I found it quite taxing and can only say that I’ve gained some insights, though I still only grasp the surface. However, during this period, I had a rather strange thought…”

At this point, Chen Ping’an casually pulled out a bamboo slip from nearby, placing it on the ground in front of him. He lightly traced his finger across the center and said, “If the entire universe is a ‘one,’ then whether the world is good or bad might depend on the gathering of sentient beings’ good intentions and evil actions, pulling against each other like a tug-of-war? If one side were to completely win one day, would it not turn the heavens and earth upside down, transforming into an entirely different existence? Good and evil, rules, and morals would all change. Just like when the divine path was extinguished, and the heavenly court collapsed, countless deities shattered, and the various teachings arose to stabilize the mountains and rivers, resulting in today’s situation. However, once a practitioner attains enlightenment and immortality, severing ties with the mortal realm, no longer being human, what connection does this transcendence have with the already detached ‘me’?”

Cui Cheng pointed at the bamboo slip in front of Chen Ping’an, “Perhaps the answer has already been revealed; why must you ask others?”

Chen Ping’an looked down at the yellowed bamboo slip, which bore the words he had inscribed himself: **“The victory or defeat of a moment relies on strength, while the victory or defeat of eternity relies on principle.”**

Chen Ping’an murmured, “But as a mere commoner, even if I were among the practitioners on the mountain, how many can truly see this ‘eternity’? Why must it be so difficult to be a good person? Why must one pay a price to speak reason? Why must it be that living poorly in this life means placing hope on the next? Why must reasoning depend on status, power, iron cavalry, cultivation, fists, and swords?”

Cui Cheng chuckled, “Can’t figure it out?”

Chen Ping’an fell silent.

Cui Cheng rose to his feet and pointed upwards, “If you can’t figure it out, then go personally ask those who might have already understood, like that old scholar. That old scholar, with his so-called ‘inappropriate knowledge,’ could invite the Ancestors of the Dao and Buddha to take a seat. You, Chen Ping’an, have two fists and a sword; why not give it a try?”

Chen Ping’an lifted his head.

Cui Cheng withdrew his hand and smiled, “Do you believe such grand talk?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled lightly.

Cui Cheng asked, “What do you think of a scholar in a prosperous era who scolds a martial artist in a chaotic world, saying that even if he unifies the realm, he is still a killer of the innocent, not a good person?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Setting aside the fundamental good and evil, he’s just foolish. The key is that even if he acknowledges the other’s merits, he doesn’t truly accept them. The only reason he expresses such is to facilitate his next remark, hence he is foolish and bad.”

Cui Cheng pointed outside, “With this answer, someone at Fallen Down Mountain, who could either meet or not meet you, is likely willing to see you. After that, it’s up to you whether you wish to meet him or not. How to converse once you meet is your own business. After you leave, remember to close the door.”

Chen Ping’an turned to look. The old scholar, clad in a Confucian robe, carried neither a shabby nor a grand air.

Chen Ping’an stood up and walked outside, gently closing the door. The old scholar leaned against the railing, gazing south, while Chen Ping’an stood shoulder to shoulder with this once-prized disciple of the Sage of Literature from the Dali Dynasty.

Cui Cheng descended the stairs first, with Chen Ping’an following behind as they headed up the mountain toward the mountain god’s temple at the peak.

The Song Mountain deity had long since retreated.

Leaving the bamboo building, the two continued to walk side by side, ascending the steps.

Cui Cheng’s first sentence, unexpectedly, was an aside, “Wei Ban didn’t greet you because I pressured him; you need not harbor any resentment.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Of course.”

Cui Cheng asked, “What was your impression of your trip to Shujian Lake?”

Chen Ping’an said, “To be polite, it was fine. Although it was a bit rough, it wasn’t without gains. At times, I should thank you, after all, bad things are nothing to fear at an early stage. If I were to speak harshly, I would say I’ve remembered this debt, and if I have the chance in the future, I’ll come to collect from the National Master.”

Cui Cheng merely hummed in acknowledgment, seemingly indifferent, as he continued speaking, “The situation in Fuyou Continent has started to become chaotic. Tongye Continent has benefited from disaster; the plots of several major monsters were revealed early, leading to stability. As for the closest to the Upside Down Mountain, with Chen Chunan around, it seems unlikely to descend into chaos. The Yin-Yang family from Zhongtu Shenzhou, an elder ancestor exhausted all their cultivation to finally provide the Confucian Temple with a concrete result; once the Sword Qi Great Wall is breached, the Upside Down Mountain will be reclaimed by Daoist Lao Er, with Nanguo and Fuyou likely becoming the monsters’ possessions. Thus, the monster clan will seize the fortunes of both continents, ushering in a brief period of calm before they launch a full-scale assault on Zhongtu Shenzhou. By then, the common folk will suffer greatly, smoke will fill the air for miles, countless Confucian sages and gentlemen will fall, and the various schools will also suffer great damage. Fortunately, a scholar, who is not part of any Confucian lineage, has left the isolated island, wielding a sword to carve open the gates of a certain secret realm, which can accommodate many refugees. That’s why disciples of the Confucian academies across those three continents have already begun preparing for future relocations.”

Cui Cheng paused slightly, “This is only part of the truth. The complex schemes behind this, both enemy and ally, as well as within the vast realm of Haoran, among the Confucians, and the various schools betting on outcomes, is truly a tangled mess. This is far more complex than when you pulled on a thread of someone’s heart in Shujian Lake. Human hearts vary, so one cannot blame the unpredictable ways of heaven.”

Chen Ping'an’s expression remained neutral as he instinctively reached for his wine from the Sword-raising Gourd, but quickly stopped his movement.

Cui Cheng continued to ascend, saying slowly, “The only silver lining in this misfortune is that we still have time.”

Cui Cheng stated, “Cui Dongshan likely didn’t share this with you in his letter, most likely wanting to wait until you returned from Beiju Lu to bring it up. One, to avoid distracting you from sword practice, and two, at that time, even as Cui Dongshan’s disciple, he could still act with some swagger in Baoping Continent, to come and show off in front of you. I can roughly guess that he would say to you at that time, ‘Rest assured, sir, with me around, Baoping Continent is safe.’ Cui Dongshan feels that this would bring him a sense of security. The fact that Cui Dongshan is now willing to do all this is far more effective than my scheming to get him to lower his head and come out of hiding, so I owe you thanks.”

Chen Ping’an remained silent.

Cui Cheng glanced at the jade hairpin in Chen Ping’an’s hair, “Chen Ping’an, how should I put this? When you’re clever and cautious, you’ve never seemed like a youth, and now you don’t seem like a young man just coming of age. Yet when you act foolishly, you also tend to miss the obvious. Why did Zhu Lian remind you that the partridge calls in the mountains? If your heart were truly settled, like how you usually act, calm as a Buddha, why fear saying goodbye to a friend? Whether it’s the grievances of the world or love, it’s not about how you speak but how you act.”

“Moreover, have you ever thought about why, during the Old Dragon City incident, the one who acted was the ascendant Du Mao, using his life-bound artifact, the Sword-swallowing Boat? That’s why even the jade token he gifted you was destroyed. If it were an ordinary hairpin, wouldn’t it still exist?”

Cui Cheng placed his hands behind his back and raised his head, “Seeing the small reveals the large. Always looking at the bright, radiant sun, your heart like a flower or tree, thriving toward the sun—shouldn’t you take a moment to look back at the shadow behind you?”

Chen Ping’an reached up to touch the jade hairpin, then pulled back his hand and asked, “Why does the National Master share these sincere words with me?”

Cui Cheng laughed freely, “Half of me is now your disciple; my grandfather is still staying at your home. As the National Master of Dali, shouldn’t I speak of being clear on public and private matters?”

Chen Ping’an believed him but not entirely.

Cui Cheng reached the top of the steps and turned to gaze into the distance.

Chen Ping’an took down the Sword-raising Gourd, raised it, and said, “I’ll have a drink,” then sat on the steps.

Cui Cheng asked, “Who do you think will be the new emperor of Dali? Prince Song Changjing? Song Jixin, who’s being raised in Lizhu Cave? Or that favored prince, Song He?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head.

Cui Cheng chuckled, “Song Changjing chose Song Jixin, I chose my disciple Song He, then made a compromise. A second capital will be built south of Guanhai Academy, with Song Jixin being enfeoffed as a prince in Old Dragon City while remotely controlling the second capital. This time, the lady who’s been eating vegetarian meals in the Changchun Palace for several years has not been able to say a word, afraid of death. She probably still thinks she’s dreaming, unable to believe such good fortune exists. In truth, the late emperor hoped for his brother Song Changjing to oversee the state and then directly ascend to the throne, but Song Changjing did not agree, burning that will in front of me.”

Chen Ping’an took a sip of wine and wiped his mouth, “So it’s a happy outcome for all.”

Cui Cheng asked, “After you left Hongzhu Town and traveled south to Shujian Lake, how did you feel?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “There were many dead.”

His expression was murky as he added, “Many!”

Cui Cheng lightly stepped down, “The joys and sorrows of the world naturally know no distinctions between rich and poor, nor does the weight of loss differ much. But there are indeed distinctions in position.”

Cui Cheng asked, “Do you know why I chose Dali as my base? And why Qi Jingchun built the Cliffside Academy in Dali? At that time, Qi Jingchun had plenty of choices, many better than this one.”

Chen Ping’an said, “I only know it’s not like the rumors say, that Mr. Qi wanted to counter you, his master who betrayed his ancestors. As for the truth, I’m not clear.”

Cui Cheng smiled, “Qi Jingchun’s favorite thing to do in life is to engage in thankless tasks. He feared that the commotion I stirred up in Baoping Continent would be too significant, perhaps implicating the old scholar who had already distanced himself from the matter. Thus, he had to personally watch over what I was doing to feel at ease; he wants to be responsible for the people of the continent. He believes that no matter who we are, when pursuing something, if a price must be paid, as long as one is diligent and sincere, one can make fewer mistakes. And correcting mistakes and making amends is the responsibility of a scholar; a scholar cannot just talk about serving the country. This is the same as your situation at Shujian Lake, where you like to shoulder burdens. Otherwise, where would that deadlock have ended? If you had simply killed Gu Can, once you become a sword immortal, it would be quite a tale.”

Chen Ping’an remained silent.

Cui Cheng laughed, “I know you don’t believe it. That’s fine. What I’m saying is personal; I have my own motives.”

Cui Cheng asked, “Have you ever thought about why Ah Liang and Qi Jingchun were so close? Why did they not kill me in the Dali Capital back then, even the late emperor did not kill me but merely sabotaged that imitation of Baiyu Capital, allowing the late emperor three more years of life?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “I don’t know.”

Cui Cheng smiled, “You might follow the theories of a certain ‘stinky ox-nosed scholar’ and think more about the established facts you’ve already seen; it’s not that difficult to deduce.”

Chen Ping’an slowly said, “The Dali cavalry advanced south at an accelerated pace, far quicker than expected, because the Dali emperor also had ulterior motives. He wanted to see Baoping Continent’s southern coast with the Dali cavalry while still alive.”

Cui Cheng pointed toward a place, “Look again at the Upside Down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Chen Ping’an frowned, “The battle that determined the Sword Qi Great Wall’s fate relied on Ah Liang’s intervention. The Yin-Yang family’s calculations, which looked solely at the outcome without considering the process, ultimately missed a significant flaw.”

Cui Cheng shifted his hand, “And how about Tongye Continent?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “It seemed to be protected by fortune, causing the monster clan’s schemes to surface too early, thereby escaping disaster. If we assume the monsters could indeed breach the Great Wall, Tongye Continent would not be suitable as the first target of attack. The crisis would lean toward Nanguo Continent and Fuyou Continent, especially the latter.”

Cui Cheng pointed to the ground, “What about our Baoping Continent’s territory?”

Chen Ping’an took a sip of wine, “It is the smallest among the nine continents of Haoran.”

Cui Cheng asked again, “Does territory have size, but do the fortunes of each continent differ in size?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “Not at all.”

Cui Cheng directed his finger further south, “You’re about to head to Beiju Lu, so how far apart are Baoping Continent and Tongye Continent?”

Chen Ping’an tightened his grip on the Sword-raising Gourd, “Compared to the distances between other continents, they are indeed very close.”

Cui Cheng raised his hand and pointed behind him, “Earlier, the sword cultivators from Beiju Lu obscured the sky in their rush to support the Sword Qi Great Wall. Wasn’t that something you witnessed firsthand?”

Chen Ping’an felt beads of sweat forming on his forehead as he nodded with difficulty.

Cui Cheng smiled, “No wonder you couldn’t see these so-called world trends clearly earlier. Now, one end of this thread has appeared. Let me ask you first, does the old leader of Donghai Guan Dao Temple wish to compare his Daoist methods with the Ancestor of the Dao?”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

Cui Cheng then asked, “Do you know why people like to mock Daoists as ‘stinky ox-nosed old Daoists’?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Because it’s said that the Ancestor of the Dao once rode a green ox to wander across the major worlds.”

Cui Cheng sighed softly, “That’s one end of the thread. That old leader is one of the longest-living beings in the world; you cannot imagine his age.”

Chen Ping’an put away the Sword-raising Gourd, rubbing his cheeks with both hands, his palms sweaty.

The true identity of the old leader of Donghai Guan Dao Temple was revealed.

Cui Cheng said with a smile, “You might want to think about the worst-case scenario, where the best outcome for Tongye Continent comes from one end of this thread. That youth, who inadvertently disrupted the plans of the great monster of the Fuyin Sect, what if it was the old Daoist’s doing? That youth was naturally unaware, but the old Daoist was intentional.”

Chen Ping’an took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and steadied his mind using the Sword Furnace.

His thoughts were chaotic, like falling snowflakes.

Even if he didn’t care about Tongye Continent's fate, what about those he knew? What would happen to them?

“I advise you, don’t draw extra lines. Believe it or not, those who were originally not meant to die might even turn misfortune into fortune because of you. After saying this, most will end up in the ‘should die, must die’ category. I’ve mentioned before, fortunately, we still have time.”

Cui Cheng seemed unconcerned about this; how Chen Ping’an acted did not matter to him. He merely said indifferently, “I once traveled the world, and one of my foundational studies, apart from being looked down upon by the old scholar, lies in the subtleties. Therefore, before stepping onto Baoping Continent, I had already firmly believed in two things: that the monster clan breaking through the Sword Qi Great Wall is an inevitable trend! Once the monsters invade Haoran, attacking Tongye Continent is a certainty! If they take Tongye Continent, what is a mere Baoping Continent? The elite sword cultivators being drawn away from Beiju Lu, what of that?! A merchant-dominated Aiai Continent, facing a formidable enemy, how much spirit can they truly muster?”

Cui Cheng waved his hand dramatically, “At the very least, it’s three continents, and in an instant, they will all be under control! Once Aiai Continent weighs the situation and chooses to surrender without a fight, even if we say Aiai Continent chooses neutrality and does not assist either side, who will suffer more in the end? In this way, how much of the monster clan’s territory and fortunes will they seize? Does that not count as establishing a foothold? How many continents are there in Haoran? Would the monster clan, once they invade the northwest Xiuxia Continent, slowly plot against it, truly be as some clever individuals think—that they can simply close the door and beat a dog once they enter? Instead, Haoran has a chance to take advantage of the situation and seize control of the wild world?”

Chen Ping’an gradually stood up, “I understand.”

Not only did he understand why Cui Dongshan had that question at the Cliffside Academy back then, but he also understood why Ah Liang had not dealt a fatal blow to the Dali Dynasty back then.

Cui Cheng laughed loudly, glancing around, “To say that I, Cui Cheng, am ambitious and wish to promote a single person’s knowledge across a continent? To be a national master of a continent, isn’t that a great ambition?”

Cui Cheng’s face bore a mocking smile as he clicked his tongue, “A punch can break a mountain, a sword can kill millions; is that impressive? Is that refreshing? Under the current trend, you, Chen Ping’an, can just wait and see. Count on your fingers how many of the top five realm cultivators from Tongye Continent can remain standing by the end, whether good or evil, how many mountain peaks can they hold onto? Then look at the monsters flooding onto the shores of Tongye Continent, whether they’ll pay or negotiate.”

Cui Cheng’s lips curled into a smirk, “Everything must be repaid.”

Cui Cheng extended a hand, slicing downward as swiftly as a knife, “Ah Liang, back in Dali Capital, never spoke a word about this to me. But at that time, I was even more certain that Ah Liang believed that the worst outcome would inevitably come, just like Qi Jingchun back in the day. This has nothing to do with whether they recognize me, Cui Cheng. So I want all the scholars of Haoran and those beasts of the wild world to see how I, relying on myself, can transform a continent’s resources into national power, using Old Dragon City as a pivot to create an ironclad defense line along the southern coast of Baoping Continent!”

Cui Cheng swept his sleeve, and the clouds and winds changed dramatically.

At the peak of Fallen Down Mountain, a thick fog quickly rolled in.

The world turned pitch black, and one could not see their own hands. Meanwhile, Chen Ping’an noticed that beneath him, a map of mountains and rivers gradually emerged, scattered like stars, dimly resembling the lights of countless homes.

Nanguo Continent, Southwest Fuyou Continent, East Baoping Continent, Southeast Tongye Continent, the northward Lu Continent that had seized the prefix “North,” and the northernmost Aiai Continent, as well as the Western Golden Armor Continent and the Northwestern Xiuxia Continent.

Finally, it was the Zhongtu Shenzhou, surrounded by the stars.

The heavens are round, and the earth is square.

This was not surprising, as Haoran itself was but one of the “fragments.” The Qingming world ruled by the Daoists and the wild world were similarly fragments.

Chen Ping’an hesitated to speak but ultimately refrained from asking that question because he already had the answer.

Why doesn’t Cui Cheng reveal this to the world?

Because once it’s revealed, no one would listen, and even if they did, they wouldn’t necessarily believe it.

Moreover, once the truth was exposed, the monster clan would naturally have countermeasures.

Cui Cheng changed the subject, smiling, “There was once an ancient prophecy that was not widely spread, and those who believe in it are probably few in number. When I was young, I accidentally flipped through a book and happened upon that sentence, thinking I owed that person a drink. The prophecy went: ‘Those skilled in arts will conquer the world.’ Not the arts of the Yin-Yang family, but the bottom-tier arts among the various schools, looked down upon even by merchants—the very arts that resemble the abacus of a merchant’s accountant.”

“What’s the flaw in all the knowledge we have among the three teachings and various schools? It lies in its inability to measure, in not discussing context, tending more toward introspection, seeking lofty principles without wanting to precisely measure the road beneath one’s feet. Therefore, when future generations pursue knowledge and begin to walk, problems arise. And the sages are not skilled at, nor do they wish to discuss these details. The Ancestor of the Dao left behind three thousand words, which he deemed a lot. The Buddha did not even establish any written words, and our greatest sage’s fundamental knowledge was similarly compiled by seventy-two students who helped summarize his teachings.”

Cui Cheng turned to look at the dazed Chen Ping’an, “You, Chen Ping’an, suffered so many hardships at Shujian Lake; why? Is it because you know fewer principles? Have seen fewer things? Is the old scholar’s sequential teaching flawed? I think not.”

Chen Ping’an was reluctant to say more about this.

Instead, he asked, “Why share these secrets with me?”

Cui Cheng smiled, “Before the game at Shujian Lake began, I made a pact with myself: as long as you win, I will tell you these things, a way to settle matters with you and Qi Jingchun.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Win? Are you joking?”

Cui Cheng nodded, “That’s indeed a joke.”

Cui Cheng waved his sleeve, and the map of mountains and rivers instantly vanished, coldly laughing, “You, Qi Jingchun, Ah Liang, the old scholar, and future Chen Qing and Chen Chunan—what you all do, in the eyes of so many self-satisfied clever people, are they not all just jokes?”

Cui Cheng turned his head, gazing at the young man in a green robe with a jade hairpin and Sword-raising Gourd. A swordsman, a wandering hero, a scholar?

Cui Cheng pointed to his own head, saying, “The game at Shujian Lake has ended, but life is not a game; it cannot be reset at every turn. Whether good or bad still lies in your hands. Depending on your current mindset and context, if you continue along this path, your achievements may not be low, but you will inevitably disappoint some, while others may rejoice. Yet disappointment and joy are unrelated to good and evil. However, I’m certain you wouldn’t want to know that answer or who each party is.”

Chen Ping’an looked at this National Master of Dali.

He was indeed reminiscent of the youthful Cui Dongshan, yet he had undeniably become a different person.

Cui Cheng smiled, “Even you, Chen Ping’an, seem like a moral sage now. This world truly is remarkable. To be honest, I regret my choice back then; the rise and fall of the world has nothing to do with me.”

Cui Cheng seemed to be speaking from the heart, finally saying two sentences that had nothing to do with the larger situation.

“Grand mansions and towering buildings can support a round moon, while in the bustling streets, hauling water home can bring back two bright moons.”

“Since ancient times, it has been hardest for the drinkers to get drunk.”

Chen Ping’an returned to sit on the steps, took down the Sword-raising Gourd, but after several attempts to raise it, he still did not drink.

Cui Cheng said, “In your heart, Qi Jingchun as a scholar and Ah Liang as a swordsman, seem like the sun and moon in the sky, guiding you and helping you move forward day and night. Now that I’ve shared this with you, you’ve already learned of Qi Jingchun’s fate and understood how Ah Liang’s sword strikes feel. So the question arises, Chen Ping’an, have you truly thought about how to proceed from here?”

Chen Ping’an remained silent.

Cui Cheng turned to leave.

Because he was actually not interested in what the answer would be.

Chen Ping’an leaned back, lying down, placing the Sword-raising Gourd beside him, closing his eyes.

He suddenly recalled the words carved on the wall of the Huangliang Tavern in Upside Down Mountain, written in a crooked script, with the trace of a worm crawling.

It was what Ah Liang had written to Mr. Qi.

The rivers and lakes hold nothing good, but the wine is still acceptable.

Chen Ping’an suddenly opened his eyes, stood up, and silently recited in his heart.

A golden thread shot out from the bamboo building atop Fallen Down Mountain, reaching the peak, where it was grasped in Chen Ping’an’s palm, the sword tip pointing downwards. He gently lifted the Sword-raising Gourd, ultimately extending his arm forward, smiling, “As long as there’s wine, that’s enough.”

Chen Ping’an held the sword and descended the mountain, drinking repeatedly. After letting go, he was truly drunk, swaying as he walked past Zhu Lian’s residence, just in time to see Cen Yuanji practicing boxing under the moonlight.

Upon noticing his alcohol-laden aura, her expression faltered, and she halted her stance, breaking her focus.

Chen Ping’an smiled as he walked by, and as he staggered away, he called back, “Cen Yuanji, your boxing really isn’t sufficient.”

Cen Yuanji closed one eye and extended her finger, seemingly wanting to speak.

With a loud thud, Chen Ping’an fell to the ground.

Cen Yuanji sighed inwardly, lamenting how he pretended to be a master and boasted so much.

The young mountain master quickly picked up the Sword Immortal hat and Sword-raising Gourd, his pace noticeably quickening.

Look, he was clearly just pretending to be drunk.

Cen Yuanji glanced back at the residence of Old God Zhu, feeling exasperated, realizing she had gotten involved with such an unreliable mountain master.

On the cliffside, Chen Ping’an leaned against a stone table, his hot cheek resting on the cool surface, gazing into the distance.

He blinked and shook his head, feeling as if he had seen something unusual.

In Longquan County, who would dare to travel so hurriedly on the wind?

In the far distance, a white rainbow streaked across the sky, its momentum astonishing, likely alarming many mountain cultivators.

Chen Ping’an closed his eyes, choosing not to care.

What was there to fear at Fallen Down Mountain?

And so, he drifted into a deep sleep.

That night, a white-clad youth with a beauty mark between his brows, driven by an obsession to meet his teacher, utilized all his powers and treasures, hurriedly returning north, destined for a swift journey south.

He gently carried the already soundly sleeping scholar in green robes on his back, his steps light, murmuring softly, “Teacher.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 552: Teacher and Student, Master and Disciple

As one of the highest peaks in Li Zhu Cave Heaven, Falling Star Mountain was an ideal spot for moon-gazing.

Dressed in white, Cui Dongshan gently closed the bamboo door on the first floor. When the handsome celestial youth stood still, he seemed a vision of the moonlit night and white clouds.

Cui Dongshan quietly ascended to the second floor, where the elder Cui Cheng had already made his way to the corridor, the moonlight washing over the railing like water. Cui Dongshan called out, “Grandfather,” and the elder smiled and nodded.

The two of them stood together, the elder with his hands clasped behind his back, while Cui Dongshan leaned against the railing, his long sleeves dangling over the edge.

Cui Cheng didn’t wish to engage in much conversation with Cui Chen, but this “Cui Dongshan,” a part of his soul that had been split, seemed closer to him, perhaps due to the familiarity it invoked from his early memories.

Cui Cheng asked, “What brings you back?”

Cui Dongshan replied softly, “I was wandering outside, but it felt lacking in excitement. When I reached the vicinity of the Wang Lake Academy, thinking of meeting those teachers, it felt like talking to a brick wall, which annoyed me, so I sneaked back.”

Cui Cheng chuckled, “Since you’re doing something that doesn’t betray your true heart, you must have perseverance and not always think about fun.”

Cui Dongshan used his chin to wipe the railing, murmuring, “Got it.”

Cui Cheng inquired, “Are you leaving tonight?”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “I still have important matters to attend to. That old bastard enjoys being serious and insists on betting with the loser. Now that I’ve chosen to bow down to him, I can’t delay his grand endeavor. I’ll be diligent and earnest, just like in my childhood when I studied under the family’s tutor.”

Cui Cheng said nothing more; he felt he had no right to dictate their affairs. Back in the day, he had been overly pedantic, imparting rigid lessons, and had loved to put on airs, which had caused the little brat to leave home in anger, wandering far away. He had left Baoping Continent for the Central Divine Continent and had taken a poor, shabby old scholar as his teacher. All this had been beyond the elder’s expectations. Each time Cui Chen wrote home asking for money, the elder had been both angry and heartbroken. The esteemed Cui family’s grandson, studying in a slum—how much knowledge could he possibly gain? It was one thing to soften up to the family and ask for money, but how could he have the face to ask for so little each month? What could that buy—just a few books of sage wisdom? Even if he didn’t eat or drink for a year, would he manage to scrape together a decent set of scholarly supplies? Of course, it was only later that the elder learned of that old scholar’s knowledge, which had reached astonishing heights.

Cui Cheng said, “Just now, Cui Chen spoke to Chen Ping’an; he should have it all covered.”

Cui Dongshan hummed in response, not surprised. Cui Chen understood him well, and in truth, Cui Dongshan viewed Cui Chen in the same light; after all, they had once been the same person.

Cui Dongshan turned his head, “Should I leave a bit later?”

Cui Cheng laughed, “Whether you leave late or early, can I stop you? Besides locking you in the attic to study when you were young, when have you ever listened to your grandfather since?”

Cui Dongshan replied, “This time, I’ll listen to grandfather.”

Cui Cheng said, “Alright, if he starts to nag, just push the blame onto me.”

Cui Dongshan burst into a grin, expertly climbing over the railing, flipping down to the first-floor ground, and strolls towards the several houses where Zhu Lian lived. He first went to Pei Qian's yard, making a series of strange noises. Rolling his eyes and sticking out his tongue, he made a frightful display, startling Pei Qian, who had just woken up in a daze. Without a moment of hesitation, she took out a yellow talisman and pressed it to her forehead, then, not even putting on her shoes, she grabbed her walking staff and dashed toward the window, eyes closed, executing a set of frenzied sword techniques while shouting, “Run! I’ll spare you if you leave now!”

Cui Dongshan shouted angrily, “If you break my teacher’s window, you’ll have to pay!”

Pei Qian froze in place, extending her fingers to gently press on the talisman on her forehead to prevent it from falling. Just in case some demon had deliberately transformed into Cui Dongshan’s likeness, she dared not let her guard down. She tentatively asked, “Who am I?”

Cui Dongshan smiled brightly, “Big Sister, of course.”

Pei Qian let out a sigh of relief; it seemed to really be Cui Dongshan. She scampered to the window, tiptoeing, and curiously asked, “Why have you come again?”

Cui Dongshan countered, “Why do you care?”

Pei Qian tucked the talisman away into her sleeve and ran to open the door, only to find that Cui Dongshan had vanished. After a quick turn, she still couldn’t find him, and just as she looked up, she saw a white figure dangling from the eaves, which scared her so much that she plopped down on the ground. Pei Qian’s eyes glistened with tears, ready to start wailing, but then Cui Dongshan, like an icicle hanging from the eaves in a snowy day, was poked down with her walking staff. He fell headfirst, thump, hitting the ground, and upon seeing this, Pei Qian burst into laughter, all her grievances instantly evaporating.

Cui Dongshan got up, shaking off his white sleeves, and casually asked, “Where’s that blind little wench?”

Pei Qian cautiously replied, “Sister Shi Rou is busy with the New Year’s shop, helping me earn money. She’s worked hard, so you can’t bully her anymore, or I’ll tell the teacher.”

Cui Dongshan snorted, “Tell? Your teacher is my teacher; it’s obvious I’m closer to him. When I first knew the teacher, you were still playing in the mud.”

Pei Qian didn’t want to be outdone in this regard, thought for a moment, and said, “This time, the teacher went traveling in the Shuishui Kingdom, and he brought me a whole bunch of gifts, more than I can count. Do you have any? Even if you do, can you compare to me?”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “You think you can compare your possessions to the one known as ‘Treasure Grandpa’ in the Jianghu?”

Pei Qian said earnestly, “That doesn’t count; we’re only comparing the gifts our masters and teachers gave us.”

Cui Dongshan spread his hands, “Losing to the big sister isn’t shameful.”

Pei Qian nodded, “Those who know the times are the true heroes.”

Cui Dongshan poked her forehead lightly, “You’re just full of flowery words, trying to annoy the ancient sages.”

Pei Qian swatted away Cui Dongshan’s finger, shyly saying, “You’re being rude.”

Cui Dongshan found it amusing that such fine vocabulary was being wasted on the little black carbon.

Cui Dongshan began to walk out of the yard, “Let’s go find Zhu Tou and have some fun.”

Pei Qian was now wide awake, cheerfully following behind Cui Dongshan as she recounted her exploits with Baoping as they stirred up a hornet's nest. Cui Dongshan asked, “You being naughty is one thing, but dragging little Baoping into it too—did the teacher not scold you?”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “You’re just talking nonsense.”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “My teacher really treats you like his own daughter.”

Pei Qian laughed heartily, the big white goose sure knew how to talk.

As for the name “Big White Goose,” it was a nickname Pei Qian had privately given to Cui Dongshan, a secret she had shared only with her most tight-lipped sister, Baoping.

As they passed a house, there was a muffled sound of someone practicing punches from within.

Cui Dongshan stepped lightly into the air, climbing higher, and saw a slender and beautiful girl practicing her teacher’s signature Six-Step Punch. Pei Qian leaned her staff against the wall, took a few steps back, leaped high, stepped on her staff, and with both hands grasping the wall’s edge, she exerted herself slightly, successfully peeking her head out. Cui Dongshan rubbed his face and muttered, “That punch truly stings my eyes.”

Pei Qian lowered her voice, “Cen Yuanji isn’t bad-hearted; she’s just a bit foolish.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “I can tell.”

Cen Yuanji was indeed Zhu Lian’s chosen disciple, a girl with the potential to reach the Golden Body realm. In a place like Falling Star Mountain, where strange creatures and immortals roamed freely, she was hardly noticeable. Toss her into Shuishui Kingdom or Caiyi Kingdom, and if she managed to reach the Seventh Realm, she would be a true master, navigating the shallow Jianghu like a python swimming through a pond, making quite the splash.

However, Cen Yuanji was still in the early stages of her training. While it was already commendable for her to immerse herself fully in practice, it wasn’t until she took a short break and stopped her punches that she heard the whispers from the wall. Instantly, she shifted to the side, stepped back, and pulled her fists into a stance, raising her head and shouting angrily, “Who’s there?!”

When she saw the handsome “young man,” her brow furrowed. Why was this seemingly ethereal stranger here? But then she noticed Pei Qian beside him grinning widely, and she finally relaxed.

Cui Dongshan leaned his elbows on the wall and asked, “Are you the pig head… oh no, the named disciple chosen by Zhu Lian to come up the mountain?”

Cen Yuanji didn’t answer but looked towards Pei Qian.

Pei Qian smiled broadly and introduced, “This is Cui Dongshan; he’s my master’s student, and our seniority is the same.”

Cen Yuanji began to ponder.

The young mountain lord’s student? 

This strikingly handsome boy looking so refined—was he actually foolish? Of all people, he chose to learn from that good-for-nothing? He spent all year wandering aimlessly, only occasionally returning to the mountain to drink and be rowdy at night. What could one possibly learn from such a man? That guy must be out of his mind to take him as his teacher; was he really that desperate for money?

Cen Yuanji sighed inwardly, looking at the white-clad handsome youth with a hint of pity.

Cui Dongshan spoke softly, “He’s truly foolish, not pretending.”

Pei Qian nodded, “I didn’t lie to you, did I?”

The two heads almost simultaneously disappeared from the wall, perfectly in sync.

Cen Yuanji didn’t bother to argue; after all, there were plenty of strange people and incidents on Falling Star Mountain.

Cui Dongshan didn’t go to find Zhu Lian, instead taking Pei Qian to the peak of Falling Star Mountain. He stomped his foot and shouted, “Why don’t you come out!”

The mountain god, Song Yuzhang, quickly revealed his true form. Facing this “youth” whose real identity he had known since long ago, Song Yuzhang bowed deeply at the steps outside the shrine but didn’t address him.

Cui Dongshan’s expression darkened, a fierce aura radiating from him as he strode forward, leaving Song Yuzhang standing still.

Pei Qian sensed something was off; was Cui Dongshan about to cause trouble again? She hurriedly followed him and whispered, “Talk nicely; distant relatives aren’t as good as close neighbors. In the end, it’s the teacher who will have it hard.”

Cui Dongshan sighed and stood before the calm mountain god, asking, “You’ve died as an official and finally become a mountain god, yet you still don’t understand?”

Though Song Yuzhang held respect for the “National Teacher Cui Chen,” he was confident in his own principles and would not show the slightest hint of timidity. He slowly replied, “There are many who know how to be officials and how to live well. Not only does the Great Li lack such people, but from the already fallen Lu Dynasty to the struggling Gao family of the Sui, and to the opportunistic vassal states like Huang Ting Kingdom—how could there be any shortage?”

Cui Dongshan asked, “Then let me ask you, whether as an official or a mountain god, placed in this position by the Song family of Great Li, are you pursuing moral self-fulfillment or truly serving the nation and the people?”

Song Yuzhang countered, “National Teacher, are you saying that I can’t pursue both?”

Cui Dongshan waved his sleeve, impatiently saying, “I don’t want to waste time with you.”

Song Yuzhang bowed and bid farewell, meticulously returning to the clay statue of the god and actively “closing the door,” temporarily giving up his patrol over Falling Star Mountain.

Cui Dongshan strolled casually at the mountain’s peak with Pei Qian, who asked curiously, “Why are you angry?”

“I’m not angry. I never get mad at foolish people; I only worry about not being smart enough myself.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, spreading his hands as he gestured, “Everyone has their own way of living. Knowledge, reason, old sayings, experiences, and so on, all add up to build a house for oneself. Some are small, like the little houses in Mud Bottle Alley or Apricot Blossom Lane, while others are grand, like the mansions on Fulu Street in Taoye Lane. Now, the immortal residences on the major mountain peaks, and even the human palaces—the White Emperor City in Central Divine Continent, the Baishi Capital in Qingming Heaven. Beyond size, there’s also stability. Large but unstable is like a house in the air, while small yet solid is better than a big one that can’t withstand the wind and rain. When hardships come, the grand structure collapses. Moreover, it also depends on the number of doors and windows. The more there are, and the more often they open, the quicker one can embrace the outside scenery. The fewer there are and the more they’re kept shut, it means a person will be strong yet easily get stuck in their own ways, living very self-centeredly.”

Pei Qian nodded, “I like looking at all kinds of houses, so I understand what you’re saying. That mountain god, who isn’t afraid of you, is clearly someone who keeps his heart tightly shut, stubborn and set in his ways.”

Cui Dongshan turned his head, glancing at Pei Qian’s eyes, and smiled, “Not bad, quite clever.”

Pei Qian crossed her arms, holding her walking staff, “Of course. I’m almost old enough to go to school.”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “But let me remind you, a house has limited space. If you put one thing in, you can’t fit another. Many scholars read so much that they become foolish because they read too many books of one kind. Every time they read one more, it covers the windows and doors a little more. Thus, in the end, they see the world less clearly. In the blink of an eye, they’ve grown old and still scratch their heads in confusion, wondering why they read so much yet live worse than pigs or dogs. In the end, they can only comfort themselves by saying, ‘The world is going downhill; it’s not my fault.’”

Pei Qian looked around to ensure no one was watching, then whispered, “I’m going to school just to make it easier for the teacher when he goes far away. I’m not really going to study, learning some rubbish that gives me a headache.”

Cui Dongshan blinked, then burst into laughter, dashing down the mountain, “I’m off to report!”

Pei Qian was taken aback for a moment, then, with tears welling up, she began to sprint after the big white goose.

Cui Dongshan suddenly stopped at a staircase, turning to look back, only to see a little black carbon girl. In her eagerness to catch up, she leaped high from the peak, reminiscent of that grass sandal boy from Mud Bottle Alley, soaring like a hawk.

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Teacher, student, disciple. It turns out we’re all the same, all so afraid of growing up while having to do so.”

Suddenly, a hand slapped the back of Cui Dongshan’s head, and the unexpected guest chuckled, “Picking on Pei Qian again.”

Before the words were finished, a figure in a green shirt rushed over from the bamboo building on Falling Star Mountain. With a light tap of their toes, they swooped in and embraced Pei Qian, setting her down gently. Cui Dongshan smiled and bowed, “I was wrong.”

Pei Qian wiped the sweat from her face, and with a glint in her eyes, she began to defend Cui Dongshan, “Teacher, we were just playing; we didn’t say anything at all.”

Cui Dongshan nodded fervently, “Exactly!”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Do you believe yourselves?”

Pei Qian and Cui Dongshan answered in unison, “We do!”

Chen Ping’an didn’t dig deeper; after all, it was all just playful nonsense.

The three of them headed down the mountain together.

Teacher and student, master and disciple.

In white and green, with a little black carbon.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 553: The Moonlight Over the World, This Mountain Holds the Most

The three of them arrived at the cliffside, each finding a seat. However, Chen Ping'an's counterpart was avoided by both Cui Dongshan and Pei Qian, as they preferred to sit a little farther from their teacher or master.

The moonlight was less bright than that found in the wealthy households, yet the glow of the mountains and fields was particularly enchanting.

As the three gazed into the distance, the person of highest rank among them could see the closest sights. Even with the moonlight, Chen Ping'an still struggled to see far, while Pei Qian could make out the faint glow from Hongzhu Town and the delicate green of Qidun Mountain, remnants of the bamboo planted by Wei Ban back in the day, which still bestowed blessings upon the misty mountain waters. As a Nascent Soul Earth Immortal, Cui Dongshan naturally had a broader view, taking in the general contours of Xiuhua, Chongdan, and the Three Rivers of Yuye, all twisting and turning within his sight.

Pei Qian pulled out a bag of sunflower seeds from her pocket and placed them on the stone table. She believed that sharing joy was better than indulging alone, although she was careful to position them a bit closer to her master and herself.

Cui Dongshan heard the soft sound of seeds hitting the ground and returned to his senses, recalling something important. With a twist of his wrist, he produced four bags of varying sizes and placed them gently on the ground. The bags shimmered with a gentle glow, their surfaces reflecting the moonlight in a spectrum of colors. Cui Dongshan smiled and said, “Teacher, this is the five-colored soil from the future Baoping Continent’s Four Peaks. Don’t be fooled by the small size of the bags; they are quite heavy. Even the smallest one weighs over forty pounds and was dug from the ancestral roots of the major mountains. We’re only missing the soil from the North Peak, Piyun Mountain.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “You’ve worked hard.”

Cui Dongshan replied cheerfully, “Hard work? If it weren’t for this bit of hope, I might as well have suffocated to death out here!”

Pei Qian stood up, stretching her neck, “Can I take a look?”

Cui Dongshan waved his hand, “Go ahead, go ahead! You should be ashamed of yourself, you little money-loser! Look at how I’m helping our teacher with his troubles, and then look at yourself! As the first disciple of our teacher, you’re content to earn a few dozen taels of silver each month over in Qilong Alley? If you can’t bring in at least twenty or thirty taels of profit each month, how can you even think of taking credit? Only if you earn three hundred taels a year can you think of buying a decent little house in Longquan County!”

Pei Qian crossed her arms defiantly, “I’m not looking at anything! Forget it!”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “Then I’ll beg you to look. Will you or won’t you?”

Pei Qian gave a thumbs up, “You’re so generous!”

Not giving Cui Dongshan a chance to change his mind, she dashed around Chen Ping'an and went to open the fabled bags of five-colored soil. She squatted down, her eyes wide with excitement, her face glowing as she stared at the colorful soil. She remembered her master once mentioning a certain celestial book that spoke of a type of soil called Guanyin soil, which could be eaten when one was hungry. She wondered if this five-colored mud could be eaten, too.

Cui Dongshan kicked Pei Qian lightly on her bottom, “You little girl, with such shallow eyes, be careful in the future when you’re wandering the world! If you meet a charming scholar with honeyed words, you might just be swindled away!”

Pei Qian shrugged off the comment, “If I don’t beat them until their brains are scrambled, it’s just my chivalrous heart!”

Cui Dongshan began discussing serious matters, turning to Chen Ping'an, and said slowly, “Teacher, this trip to North Julu Continent should include Wei Ban’s share as well. We can wait for news over there, which should take about a year and a half to two years. When the Great Li’s Song clan officially confers the remaining Four Peaks, that will be the best time for you to refine this material. This time, you can’t be too early, but it doesn’t hurt to be late. To be frank, refining the five-colored soil in the future Central Peak will yield the best benefits and more easily attract anomalies and blessings. However, we should still give the Great Li’s Song clan some face; otherwise, it would be too embarrassing, with the whole court watching. Just after Song He ascends to the throne, he’ll be labeled the greatest emperor in history for expanding the territory of Baoping Continent. He could easily get carried away, and with people egging him on, it could become a serious issue for us at Luopo Mountain. After all, when he’s busy, he won’t have time for such matters. It’s always the case that those who do things tend to make more mistakes and are less appreciated. When the time comes for unifying the Baoping Continent, he’ll have to face many constraints from the Central Divine Continent; it won’t be small troubles. On the contrary, those who do nothing, like Song He, will enjoy peace. As long as a person is idle, grievances will arise.”

“I’m aware of the refinement of the five-colored soil,” Chen Ping'an said with a nod. However, he expressed concern, “Once the Great Li’s cavalry captures the Baoping Continent, after everyone has received their rewards for their contributions, it’s inevitable that morale will wane. It won’t be easy to reveal the heavenly secrets to them in a short time. That will be the real test of your and Cui Dongshan’s abilities to govern and manage people.”

Cui Dongshan smiled, “At that time, there will definitely be many worries, but it won’t lead to chaos. A new house with a solid foundation and a good frame, as long as the beams don’t go astray, we won’t fear wind and rain. If the window paper tears or some roof tiles fall, those are just small matters to patch up. Once the new house becomes an old one, with the doors rotting and the pillars cracking, and white ants and snakes infesting the inside, it wouldn’t be a problem for me and that old fool to worry about.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, choosing not to say more. Achievements often require meticulous effort, and he mustn’t forget that this fellow before him was the ancestor of such knowledge.

Cui Dongshan glanced at the bamboo loft before returning his gaze to Chen Ping'an, asking, “Now that we have many more mountains, Luopo Mountain is needless to mention; it’s already better than ever. What about the other places like Gray Mist Mountain, Ao Fish Back, and the Sword Offering Platform? Have you chosen the spots for burying the soil?”

Chen Ping'an gave a bitter smile, “A skilled woman can’t make a meal without rice. I have some ideas, but no suitable items.”

The grains meant to create the protective array for Luopo Mountain had already been consumed. It was ultimately not a sustainable plan. Thus, this trip to North Julu Continent should not only involve sword practice but also an attempt to become a true wild cultivator—visiting the ruins of immortal abodes in the mountains and searching for hidden dragon palaces underwater, to see if he could earn some unexpected wealth to help with living expenses.

Cui Dongshan was about to speak when Chen Ping'an waved his hand, “That’s a different matter. Even siblings in a family need to settle accounts clearly.”

Cui Dongshan felt somewhat aggrieved. If he wanted, he could likely rival anyone in the world with his abilities like that of the Wealthy Boy, but it seemed that only those surnamed Liu from Aihai Continent could match him.

Chen Ping'an casually asked, “How is Wei Xian doing after following along?”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “After leaving the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Wei Xian’s ambitions shifted away from reaching the pinnacle of martial arts. The talents I have on hand are pitifully few. Since Wei Xian has that ambition, I’ll give him a nudge. When we return to the Guanhua Academy, I’ll soon throw him into the Great Li’s military. As for whether he chooses to align with Su Gaoshan or Cao Ping, we’ll see. It’s not particularly urgent. As Great Li descends southward, dead battles like the Zhu Ying Dynasty won’t be as common, but hard battles will be plentiful. Wei Xian should be able to manage, especially against those mountain immortals in the south who have grown accustomed to their power. Those ancient manors will be even tougher, and it would be a good opportunity for Wei Xian to stand out. Teacher, even if Luopo Mountain becomes an immortal abode in the future, rich in spiritual energy, it will still need one or two bridges to connect with the earthly dynasties. Wei Xian in the court, Lu Bai Xiang in the rivers and lakes, and Zhu Lian by your side—all playing their parts seems to be the best arrangement for now.”

Chen Ping'an gave a thoughtful “Mm.”

Pei Qian asked, “What about Sister Sui?”

Cui Dongshan did not answer Pei Qian’s question, instead saying seriously, “Teacher, don’t rush.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “The line you mentioned in your previous letter, ‘Shake the Great, Destroy the Strong, and Take Your Time,’ can actually apply to many things.”

Tongye Continent, the Upside-Down Mountain, and the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Originally, he planned to finish exploring North Julu Continent before heading straight to the Upside-Down Mountain. Now it seemed that after returning from the Sword Qi Great Wall, he wouldn’t be going back to Old Dragon City right away but would need to take another trip to Tongye Continent first.

Cui Dongshan hesitated for a moment, then extended a palm, “Both I and that old fool believe we still have this much time to focus on our endeavors.”

Fifty years.

Chen Ping'an turned to look west, though his view was blocked by the bamboo loft and Luopo Mountain, preventing him from seeing Long Spine Mountain, which had the Long Slayer Cliff.

The Sage Ruan Qiong, along with Zhenwu Mountain and the Wind and Snow Temple, and the Great Li from all directions have been doing this ‘mountain opening’ quietly for many years. Long Spine Mountain was the most heavily guarded among the western mountains. Even with the good relationship between Wei Ban and Chen Ping'an, he would never mention Long Spine Mountain even in passing.

Cui Dongshan looked up at the sky and, with a sigh, leaned back and stared blankly at the heavens.

Chen Ping'an and Pei Qian were munching on sunflower seeds when Pei Qian asked, “Master, do you want me to help you peel them? I can give you a big handful of seed kernels to toss into your mouth all at once.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “No need.”

Cui Dongshan interjected, “Teacher doesn’t want to eat your saliva.”

Pei Qian, like a little mouse, continued to nibble on the seeds. Noticing her leisurely pace, the table beside her was already piled high with sunflower seed shells. She asked, “Have you heard the saying ‘Dragon and Elephant Strength’? If you know it, have you ever seen a flood dragon and an elephant? You know, the kind with long tusks. The books say that the strongest in water is the flood dragon, while the strongest on land is the elephant. The name for the little white one includes this character.”

Confused, Chen Ping'an still couldn’t grasp what she was trying to say.

In the end, Cui Dongshan snorted, “If you want to say I can’t produce ivory from a dog’s mouth, just say it. Why beat around the bush?”

Pei Qian shrugged her shoulders, pleased with herself. “I didn’t say that; you know it’s true.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled.

Cui Dongshan made a throwing motion with the sunflower seeds, but Pei Qian remained unmoved, pulling the corners of her mouth. “How childish.”

Chen Ping'an lightly flicked a seed, hitting Pei Qian on the forehead. Pei Qian laughed, “Master, you’re so accurate! I can’t even dodge!”

Cui Dongshan exclaimed, “From now on, Luopo Mountain should be renamed to Horseback Mountain, with you, the teacher’s first disciple, in charge. Gray Mist Mountain is scholarly enough; let Little Baoping and Chen Ruchu stay there, and we can name it Reason Mountain. Ao Fish Back has more martial energy, so let Zhu Lian take charge there, and we can call it ‘Slap Face Mountain.’ The disciples there will all be pure martial artists, strutting around the world, and anyone without a Golden Body realm martial artist would be embarrassed to greet others. As for the Sword Offering Platform, it’s suitable for sword cultivators to train, and then we can have a good competition with ‘Slap Face Mountain’ for the name. Otherwise, we can only settle for ‘Dumb Mountain’ because the sword cultivators who travel from the Sword Offering Platform should only have their reasoning within their sheaths.”

“I’m not just a silly flatterer!” Pei Qian exclaimed angrily, “I want to go to the Sword Offering Platform! Tomorrow, I’m claiming my territory. Excluding Master, no one is allowed to compete with me! I will definitely cultivate an unparalleled sword technique there! No one can challenge me at the Sword Offering Platform, otherwise, I will…”

Chen Ping'an watched as Pei Qian's eyes suddenly sparkled with determination. He continued to leisurely munch on the seeds, interrupting her grand ambitions, “Remember to go to school first. If I return to Luopo Mountain next time and hear that you’re slacking off in your studies, you’ll see how I deal with you.”

Pei Qian’s spirited demeanor instantly deflated, “Oh.” 

She felt frustrated; it seemed that she would have to build good relationships with the scholars in the future, making sure they wouldn’t speak ill of her in front of Master. At the very least, she wanted them to say she was “somewhat diligent in her studies.” Yet, if she was indeed working hard but they still gossiped, she couldn’t be blamed for not adhering to the rules of the jianghu! After all, Master had said that in the jianghu, life and death were one’s own responsibility! She would show them what for!

Chen Ping'an turned to Cui Dongshan and asked, “Are you about to leave?”

Cui Dongshan nodded, a bitter expression on his face, “Traveling under the stars day and night, and then thinking about the journey north for you while I head south, my heart feels twisted.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Then wait a moment. I’ll go grab a couple of things, and once I’m done, you can set off.”

Chen Ping'an stood up and headed to the first floor of the bamboo loft.

Cui Dongshan looked at Pei Qian, who shook her head, “I don’t know either.”

Chen Ping'an returned with a small brocade bag and a plum pit, placing both on the table. He opened the bag to reveal a round, coin-like green seed, smiling as he said, “This is a seed of elm money that a good friend bought from the Fortune-Telling Sect on Tongye Continent. I never had the chance to plant it at Luopo Mountain. They say that if planted in good soil with plenty of sunlight, it can grow within three to five years.”

Cui Dongshan picked one of the elm seeds and nodded, “This is a good item, not ordinary celestial elm seeds. It’s a product of the ancient elm trees from the Central Divine Continent. Teacher, if I’m not mistaken, this is likely a rare item that the Fortune-Telling Sect wouldn’t sell. Most likely, that friend didn’t want you to take it and just made up an excuse. Compared to regular elm seeds, these have a much higher chance of producing elm money spirits. Even under the worst circumstances, we should at least see three or two golden spirits sprout. As for the other elm trees, once they take root, they can help gather and stabilize the spiritual energy of the mountain waters, similar to the golden carp that teacher caught back then, which is one of the favorites of the sect’s disciples.”

Chen Ping'an felt somewhat helpless.

This was indeed something Lu Tai would do.

He comforted himself that since he obtained it, he should be at peace with it. He pointed to the plum pit, and Pei Qian quickly exclaimed, “I know! This was given to Master by that skinny bamboo pole called Wu Yi from the Ziyang Prefecture, who had the puppet master pass it on to you. Later, I worried that the skinny bamboo pole would be unkind and give my master a second-rate item, so I secretly took it to Wei Ban for appraisal. He said that after a year, it could grow into a thousand-year-old yangmei tree, at least half the height of the bamboo loft. It’s also called ‘Season Plum,’ and on each of the twenty-four solar terms, it will release a plethora of spiritual energy, making it perfect for cultivators to refine their energy beneath it. Wei Ban also said that this plum pit was actually the most precious of the four gifts from Ziyang Prefecture to those with stable mountain foundations.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Then tonight, we’ll plant them both.”

Cui Dongshan glanced sideways at Pei Qian, “You choose first.”

Pei Qian beamed, “No matter how good the plum pit is, there’s only one, so I’ll definitely choose the elm money seeds, right?”

At the end of her sentence, Pei Qian stealthily looked at her master. After seeing him nod gently, she turned back to Cui Dongshan and decisively said, “This precious plum pit, I’ll let you have it! But I want to make it clear beforehand, once it grows into a big plum tree, it still belongs to Master. I want to climb the tree and play with Baoping Jie, and you can’t stop me!”

Cui Dongshan sighed.

She was truly full of cleverness, with layers of meaning behind her words.

It was fortunate to have a teacher like him to handle this little charcoal. If it were anyone else, Zhu Lian wouldn’t manage, nor would his grandfather, let alone Wei Ban and other outsiders from Luopo Mountain. 

Luopo Mountain was, in fact, quite vast.

As the southern gate of the Li Pearl Cave, it soared high into the clouds.

Thus, Chen Ping'an had never explored much of the northern side; he mostly lingered in the southern bamboo loft.

On the sunny side of the south, below the bamboo loft, near the mountain gate presided over by Zheng Dafeng, Cui Dongshan selected two nearby feng shui spots to plant the bag of elm seeds and the plum pit.

After the work was done, Pei Qian, who had exerted quite a bit of effort, was drenched in sweat but grinning from ear to ear.

Cui Dongshan remained in his white robes, untainted by dust. If we were to compare beauty in men, perhaps only Wei Ban and Lu Tai, or even Cao Ci from the Central Duan Dynasty, could rival Cui Dongshan.

Chen Ping'an softly said, “It takes ten years to grow trees and a hundred years to cultivate people. Let’s support each other.”

Cui Dongshan once again performed an exaggerated bow, saying solemnly, “Student bids farewell. Teacher, as you travel far, may your journey be smooth.”

After Chen Ping'an straightened up from Cui Dongshan’s bow, he took out a bamboo slip that he had prepared earlier, smiling, “It seems I’ve never given you a gift. Don’t mind it; the bamboo slip is just made of ordinary mountain bamboo and is worthless. Although I’ve never felt qualified to be your teacher, I often pondered the answer to that question during our three years at Shujian Lake, yet it remains quite difficult. Regardless, since you’ve called me teacher for so many years, I’ll take on the pretense of being a teacher and gift you this bamboo slip as a small farewell token.”

Cui Dongshan accepted the slightly yellowed bamboo slip, which had inscriptions on both sides.

The front was inscribed with words that had aged somewhat, “There are priorities in learning, but the sage has no fixed teacher.”

The back bore characters that were likely inscribed hastily when Chen Ping'an retrieved items from the bamboo loft earlier, but despite the rush, the writing remained meticulous and upright, “Blue comes from indigo and surpasses it.”

Pei Qian cleared her throat twice, moistening her voice, and said seriously, “Cui Dongshan, as the senior disciple, I must remind you of something. Don’t take this lightly. Master actually cares the most about these bamboo slips!”

Cui Dongshan slowly tucked the bamboo slip into his sleeve, saying, “Teacher’s expectations are earnest, and I will remember them in my heart. I also have a gift for you.”

Cui Dongshan shook his white sleeves and produced an ancient, elegant bamboo folding fan, pristine and jade-white. He handed it to Chen Ping'an with both hands, saying, “This was once the beloved treasure of someone I lost to in a game of flying swords called ‘Golden Autumn.’ It gathers the spring breeze with each fold and brings autumn vibes with a flick. The fan’s surface is plain white without any words, making it most suitable for you during your travels in strange lands during the summer.”

Chen Ping'an received the lightweight jade bamboo fan and joked, “This gift is so heavy; are you from Ao Fish Back?”

Pei Qian thought for a moment; earlier, Cui Dongshan had referred to Ao Fish Back as “Slap Face Mountain.” She had felt a bit pleased, thinking her master had made a profitable trade in gift exchanges, and now she felt a bit resentful toward Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, “Off I go, off I go!”

For some reason, Cui Dongshan faced Pei Qian and held his finger to his lips.

Pei Qian blinked, pretending not to understand.

Cui Dongshan stared at her.

Pei Qian finally stomped her foot, “Fine, I won’t say it. We’re even!”

Cui Dongshan spun around gracefully, his sleeves billowing as he swiftly transformed into a streak of white light and departed Luopo Mountain.

Chen Ping'an led Pei Qian up the mountain, taking the hoe from her hands.

Pei Qian had been holding back for a while and finally asked quietly, “Master, why don’t you ask what that Big White Goose wants me to say? If you asked, I’d have to speak up. Since you already know the answer, I wouldn’t be going back on my word; wouldn’t that be great?”

Chen Ping'an rubbed Pei Qian’s head, smiling without saying anything.

Pei Qian hopped along beside Chen Ping'an, ascending the steps together. She turned back to see that the Big White Goose had vanished from sight.

After the Big White Goose personally planted that plum pit, Pei Qian had seen a small plum tree sprout beside the deep pool where the flood dragon swayed, alongside the golden books of characters.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “Is your bullying of the white geese in the little town related to Cui Dongshan, who you nicknamed Big White Goose?”

Pei Qian wiped the sweat from her forehead and vigorously shook her head, “Master! There’s absolutely no connection, not even a half coin’s worth! I definitely didn’t think of those white geese as Cui Dongshan! Every time I see them, whether I’m fighting or later riding them around the streets, I’ve never thought of Cui Dongshan!”

Chen Ping'an stifled a laugh, “Tell the truth.”

Pei Qian, gripping her walking stick with one hand, tugged at Chen Ping'an’s sleeve with the other, looking pitiful, “Master, I’m so tired from planting those elm seed things. My head hurts from all the labor!”

Chen Ping'an held Pei Qian’s hand gently, smiling, “It’s alright; Master won’t tell on you.”

Pei Qian’s face lit up with a brilliant smile as she turned to gaze up at her master. “Master, it’s fine. Even if you did tell on me, I wouldn’t feel the slightest bit wronged. You’ve been so good to me; how could it get any better than this?”

“Master won’t return to Luopo Mountain for a while. Whether you go to school or roam around, there’s no need to be too constrained, but you also can’t be too mischievous. However, as long as you stand by what’s right, no matter how big the situation gets, don’t be afraid. Even if Master isn’t around, just look for Cui Old Senior, Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, or Wei Ban; they will all help you. But when they talk to you about reasoning afterward, you must listen obediently. Not every time you’re right means you don’t have to listen to any reasoning.”

“Okay!” 

“Master, you can rest assured. Even if I’m wronged, as long as it’s not too serious, I just need to imagine that you’re right beside me, and I won’t get angry at all.”

“After all, if you don’t encounter anything, Master can’t say much. Once I leave, you can go ask Zhu Lian or Zheng Dafeng what ‘excessive correction’ means, and then ponder it on your own. Although you’re in the right, no one at Luopo Mountain can take advantage of your righteousness. However, being a good person and suffering is never something that should be taken for granted. You don’t need to rush; think slowly. The best lessons aren’t just found in books or schools; your sister Shi Rou in Qilong Alley will have them too, and even Cen Yuanji, who learns martial arts slowly at Luopo Mountain, will have wisdom to impart. You should look more, think more. The most unprofitable trade in the world is to learn a good word from others.”

“Master…”

“I know your head is starting to hurt again, so I’ll stop here. In the coming years, even if you want to hear me nagging, you won’t have the chance.”

“Ha ha, Master, you’ve misunderstood. I’m just hungry! Listen, my stomach is growling! I’m not lying!”

“Martial artists shouldn’t be having midnight snacks at night.”

“Master, once you get to North Julu Continent, be sure to write back often! I want to let Baoping Jie and Li Huai know that I’m safe. Ha ha, let them know Master is doing well…”

“…”

With one hand holding her walking stick and the other holding Master’s hand, Pei Qian marched ahead with confidence, chest out, striding with a mix of bravado and excitement.

Together, they walked under the moonlight, ascending higher with each step.

At this moment, it felt as if the moonlight over the world was at its brightest upon this mountain.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ## Chapter 554: Another Zhu Lian

Pei Qian wasn't actually feeling sleepy; she just wanted to send Chen Ping'an off to bed. As Chen Ping'an passed by the residence of Cen Yanjuan, the muffled sound of punches and the rustling of clothes still echoed from the courtyard. At the entrance stood Zhu Lian, smiling as he looked at Chen Ping'an.

The two walked side by side, their height difference striking. The men from the northern region of Baoping Continent were already tall, and the robust youths of the Great Li Dynasty were known for their impressive stature and strength, famous across the continent. The armor and battle blades of the Great Li were renowned for their weight and were only suitable for the sharp-minded warriors of the north.

Chen Ping'an was now tall and slender, while Zhu Lian, with his habitual stooped posture, made them appear as if one belonged to the heavens and the other to the earth.

Chen Ping'an intended to send Zhu Lian to the Book Lake to deliver the funds for the water and land dojo and the annual grand ritual to Gu Can and Zeng Yi. Zhu Lian had no objections. During this time, Dong Shuijing would accompany him, stopping at Pool Water City for a private meeting with the direct descendant of the Zhu Kingdom, Guan Yiran. Both Zhu Lian and Dong Shuijing were particularly trustworthy, and with them together, Chen Ping'an didn't need to worry about giving any specific instructions.

Chen Ping'an didn't hide the state of affairs from Zhu Lian. After hearing it, Zhu Lian didn't express much sentiment but simply remarked that during his time in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, all he had done was practice in a small space, and now that he had arrived in the vast world of Haoran, he wouldn't concern himself with such grand matters. He could only do the tasks of clearing the snow in front of his door and scraping the frost off the tiles.

Upon reaching the first floor of the bamboo building, Chen Ping'an asked Zhu Lian to sit while he began to pack his belongings. The day after tomorrow, he would depart from the Bull Horn Mountain ferry, taking a ship that ran between Old Dragon City and North Julu Continent. Their destination was a renowned "place of scenic beauty," so famous that Chen Ping'an had seen it mentioned in the book of the Immortal of Upside-Down Mountain, and not in a small context. It was called Bone Marsh, a site of an ancient battlefield in southern North Julu Continent. The faction residing there was called the Pi Ma Sect, a lower sect of a major sect in the Central Lands, which housed a hundred thousand Yin soldiers and generals. Despite dealing with spirits and ghosts, the Pi Ma Sect had an excellent reputation. Their disciples, when sent down the mountain, were tasked with subduing malevolent spirits and evil beings without ever demanding a reward, regardless of whether the person was a high official or an ordinary citizen. Anyone who violated this rule would be expelled from the sect.

Thus, the disciples of the Pi Ma Sect at Bone Marsh were also known as the "Little Celestial Masters" of North Julu Continent.

Surrounding the Pi Ma Sect, within a thousand miles, there were many righteous ghost cultivators stationed, so Chen Ping'an planned to explore Bone Marsh for a few more days. After all, occupying an island in the Book Lake and establishing a suitable sect for ghostly cultivation was something Chen Ping'an had long wished for but had yet to achieve.

Zhu Lian, seeing Chen Ping'an pull out the neatly folded golden robe, hesitated for a moment, seemingly wanting to put it away and not take it to North Julu Continent.

Zhu Lian glanced at the folding fan placed on the table, a gift from Cui Dongshan. Zhu Lian could tell it was undoubtedly a magical artifact, and he smiled, saying, "Young Master, the golden robe and the folding fan are like a beautiful woman in her prime, perfectly complemented by a glassy realm that reflects her every detail."

Chen Ping'an sat behind the writing desk, meticulously counting the immortal coins, and replied with irritation, "I'm going to North Julu Continent to practice swordsmanship, not to enjoy the scenery. Besides, I've heard that in North Julu Continent, people tend to resolve their differences with violence—if I were to walk around like that, wouldn’t that be like putting a talisman on my forehead that says ‘beaten’?"

Zhu Lian smiled, "Young Master, even in the most chaotic of worlds, it won't be all fighting and killing. Isn’t there a touch of elegance even in the Book Lake? You should keep the golden robe close; it might come in handy, and it doesn't take up much space."

Suddenly, Zhu Lian's eyes lit up, and he grinned, "So, Young Master, have you decided who to 'lend' this item to?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "I want to find an opportunity to send it to the Chunru Chen Clan in South Posa Continent, addressed to Liu Xianyang."

Zhu Lian asked, "Is it through the Chen Clan of Longwei Creek, which runs a school in that small town?"

Chen Ping'an gently played with a small summer coin, which was a yellow jade copper coin, marked with inscriptions on both sides. It was no longer the ancient temple's broken coin that had been used by the ghost of Wei Wei to ward off disasters; instead, it was inscribed with the phrases "Nine Dragons Spitting Water" and "Eight Divisions of Divine Light." The inscriptions of summer coins varied greatly, unlike the snowflake coins, which were standardized across the realm. This was the genius of the wealth god Liu Clan of Ailong Continent; summer coins came from various regions, so the exchange rates fluctuated slightly.

Chen Ping'an explained, "Back when the Chunru Chen Clan came to the Lihuzhu Cave to inspect the calligraphy on the grave, the person was named Chen Dui. Although he had a bad temper and a sharp tongue, his nature was decent. The scholar who contacted Chen Dui from the Longwei Creek Chen Clan was named Chen Songfeng, who was very close to my friend Liu Baqiao. Although Chen Songfeng was softer in temperament, he lacked confidence when faced with a high-born young lady from Posa Continent, but he is a cultured man who cannot pretend. I believe that a family with a thousand years of reputation is worth more than any half-immortal artifact."

Zhu Lian did not find any issue with Chen Ping'an gifting or temporarily lending the golden robe to Liu Xianyang, but he thought the timing was wrong. He rarely insisted on his opinion in front of Chen Ping'an, saying, "Young Master, although you are now a Sixth Realm martial artist, just a step away from the next realm, the golden robe may become a burden. However, that 'step' should not be taken lightly. The journey to North Julu Continent will surely be fraught with dangers and opportunities. To put it bluntly, if you encounter a powerful sword cultivator, even if you put the golden robe on, it may help you withstand a few strikes. When you return to the Desolate Mountain next time, whether in three, five, or even ten years, it won't be too late to send it to Liu Xianyang. After all, as long as you are not merely a martial artist, even if you are a golden core or nascent soul cultivator, you wouldn’t be ashamed to wear the golden robe now."

Chen Ping'an nodded and put the golden robe into his space sword.

Zhu Lian said, "Since Cui Dongshan mentioned that we still have ample time to plan, and you agree with this viewpoint, why change your mind at the crucial moment? This is not like your usual temperament."

Chen Ping'an stared at the lamp on the table and suddenly smiled, "Zhu Lian, let’s have a drink and chat?"

Zhu Lian lowered his head and rubbed his hands, "That sounds great."

Chen Ping'an took out two bottles of treasured osmanthus wine, moved some items on the table, and sat across from Zhu Lian.

Chen Ping'an began to recount the matter of rebuilding the Eternal Life Bridge, sharing his mindset, obstacles, gains, and losses with Zhu Lian. He spoke in detail, from the shattering of his life-saving porcelain in his youth to the tug-of-war with the sect leader Lu Chen, to the three hundred years spent in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land alongside the old Daoist. He even discussed the emotional "gaps" brought on by the two encounters with the Wei and Jin dynasties at the Fengxue Temple, explaining his reasoning and the injuries he suffered during the conflicts in the Book Lake, why he had to shatter the already "moral" ink bottle, and the various sorrows and cries of the spirits.

This was fundamentally a personal journey of the Dao, which was extremely taboo, and it should have been known only to the heavens, the earth, and himself, leaving no room for others. Many divine companions on the mountain might not wish to reveal such matters to each other.

Yet, Chen Ping'an spoke lightly of it, and Zhu Lian listened without restraint, occasionally sipping his wine.

Chen Ping'an bent down and retrieved a small pottery jar from the drawer, gently pouring out a small pile of broken porcelain shards—not directly onto the table but into his palm before carefully placing them down.

"These are the shards of my life-saving porcelain that my father shattered back then. Shortly after, my mother fell ill and passed away. When I obtained them, I was in a daze, not thinking much about why they ended up in my hands; I was just heartbroken."

Chen Ping'an picked one up between his fingers, his expression dimming as he quietly said, "Before leaving Lihuzhu Cave, I killed Cai Jin from Yunxia Mountain using this. Had I failed, I wouldn't be here today. Everything before and after is a struggle. Before becoming an apprentice at the Long Kiln, I lived how I could, and after learning to make porcelain from Old Yao, I no longer feared starving or freezing. It was then I began to think about how to live well. I never expected I’d need to leave the small town and then ponder how to live, and after leaving the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, I returned to consider how to live well, what was right..."

Chen Ping'an lowered his gaze, reflecting on the patterns of the desk illuminated by the lamp light. "My life has seen many forks in the road; I've taken many detours, but there are benefits to being naive."

He raised his head, "It was when I met someone I truly respected that I realized where they stood. I became curious about how they reached that point, and it became simple. I set my direction, focused on my work, and thought about my parents, Master Qi, and A Liang—if they faced similar situations, how would they think and act? From then on, I kept learning, wanting to take everything I admired in others and make it my own, like a thief. I fear poverty, dread it deeply. I want to keep all the precious things I have. It's not that I don't care about wealth; it's not that I, Chen Ping'an, am naturally a child of wealth. It's just that for me, living with nothing but bare walls and no possessions is too common; I have no fear. Even if I were to be cast back to the Desolate Mountain, left with only an ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, I wouldn’t be afraid."

"I have stolen much from you and learned a lot too. Besides you, Zhu Lian, there are the elder Song of Jian Shui Mountain, Fan Er of Old Dragon City, Liu Youzhou of Yuan Rou Mansion, Cao Ci and Lu Tai from the Great Wall of Sword Qi, and even the national teacher of Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Zhong Qiu, and Zhou Fei of Spring Tide Palace, and the life-and-death adversaries Liu Lao Cheng, Liu Zhi Mao, and Zhang Ye. I've quietly observed you all; I envy the most outstanding aspects of all of you."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "So, Elder Cui saw through the core of the problem: there are no good things in this world without some cost. Regardless of the means, there will always be consequences."

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands, "Being human is not like practicing martial arts, where diligent training can lead to mastery. Being human is about picking up bits here and there, easily resembling the form without the essence. My mindset, once my life-saving porcelain was shattered, became scattered. Now, reduced to a state of regional rule, if I hadn't forced a distinction between the main and the secondary issues, the problem would only grow."

"If I didn’t foolishly dream of becoming a great sword immortal, that would be fine. Pure martial artists can climb step by step without considering these things. But once you learn to cultivate Qi, reaching the Fifth Realm is one hurdle, forming the golden core is another, and breaking through to the nascent soul is an even greater challenge. This isn't something that ordinary folk can just overcome year after year; if the heart isn't cultivated properly, even a single lapse can invite disaster."

Chen Ping'an emphasized, "I never thought this was overthinking. I still firmly believe that immediate victories depend on strength; this is the path to elevation, while eternal victories depend on reason; this is the foundation of existence. Both are indispensable. There has never been a situation where I can first live well and then speak of reason. Great achievements often come from unreasonable actions, and in the future, it will only lead to more unreasonable situations. In the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, the old temple master was cunning. I silently observed, hoping to see the outcomes of three matters, yet in the end, I couldn't accomplish them. Two were skipped, and the last one was severed. Leaving the banks of the river of time and returning to the human world of Lotus Flower Blessed Land, that matter involved a scholar in the history of Songxi Country—extremely wise, a successful candidate, ambitious but faced setbacks in the officialdom. Thus, he decided to suppress his nature and learn the ways of the court, conforming to local customs. One day, he hoped to rise to the central government and help the people. I really wanted to know if this scholar succeeded or gave up."

Unknowingly, Chen Ping'an stood up, holding the wine jar he hadn't drunk much from, pacing just a few feet from the desk, muttering to himself, "Many truths I know well; I’m clear about right and wrong. Even if I only look at the results, everything I’ve done isn't bad. Yet during this time, the sweetness and bitterness are all too familiar, chaotic beyond measure. For instance, back then, in the Book Lake, should I kill Gu Can, or should I become allies with Liu Zhi Mao, who had already become my enemy? Should I engage in feigned pleasantries with Liu Lao Cheng from Gong Liu Island? After learning a set of skills, how should I settle scores with my enemies? Was it to charge ahead without thinking, as I had decided back then? Or to think carefully, reconsider, and adjust? This adjustment made things right and aligned with reason, but deep down, did I really feel relieved?"

Chen Ping'an stood still, shaking his head, his gaze resolute, voice firm, "I don’t feel relieved at all."

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping'an looked up, downed a large gulp of wine, and wiped his mouth. "What should I do? At first, I thought that once I went to North Julu Continent, I would be free, but Elder Cui pointed out that while this would be useful, it wouldn't be very effective. It treats the symptoms but not the root cause. This leaves me feeling... hesitant. I’m not afraid of risks, hardships, or grievances, but what I dread most is that feeling of... being lost."

Chen Ping'an's eyes were sorrowful, "In such a vast world, alone and isolated, looking around with no one to praise me for being right and no one to blame me for being wrong, that awful feeling from my childhood lingers around me. Just the slightest reminder brings me despair. I know this mindset is very unhealthy; I’ve been slowly changing over the years, but I still haven’t done well enough. So, for Gu Can, for Liu Xianyang, for all those I consider friends, I want nothing more than to give away what I have in my hands. Is this my compassionate heart? Not at all. I just assume from the start that I can't hold onto anything, and as long as they can keep it in their hands, even if I can just catch a glimpse, it’s not a loss. Whether it’s money or possessions, it’s the same. Just like this golden robe, do I not like it? I like it very much. After going through thick and thin together, how could I not have feelings for it? What kind of person am I? I even plan to bring back the thin horse I’ve relied on for over two years from the Book Lake. But I’m afraid that one day, while traveling, it could all be lost in an instant, taken away by someone else, or perhaps become a so-called immortal opportunity, given to someone I don’t even know? That would be worse than sending it to Liu Xianyang early."

Zhu Lian set down the wine jar, no longer drinking, and said slowly, "Young Master’s worries are not just personal matters; they are ancient problems shared by all the world."

Zhu Lian gently rubbed the armrests of the chair, "This isn’t unique to you, Young Master. I, Zhu Lian, have it in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land too, as does Ding Ying, and the scholars of the Haoran world today will as well. The wise, the virtuous, the holy ones, and all awakened beings in this world share this. The essence of the teachings of the Three Teachings and various philosophical schools is a contest against the 'human heart.' The Confucian self-restraint and returning to rites, the Daoist tranquility and inaction, the Buddhist taming of the wild mind—these are all noble teachings, yet when put into practice, the thresholds are still high, much like the chicken dung and dog poop in Mud Bottle Alley, which are hard to manage. The achievements of Cui Zhan and Cui Dongshan are valuable because they can manage even the trivial matters in the alleys, but the downside is that too much effort is spent on mundane tasks. Everything becomes quantifiable, and human hearts tend to fall, becoming overly pragmatic and unwilling to engage in the abstract, making it harder to seek higher grounds."

Zhu Lian stood up, extended a finger, gently resting it on the table, and pointed, smiling, "Now, let this old servant break the rules and directly call you by name, Young Master."

Zhu Lian continued, "Stagnation means what? It means that the way you, Chen Ping'an, view this world is at odds with your true self. Those seemingly small knots in your heart will become increasingly evident as your martial arts and cultivation level rise. The stronger you become, when you strike a punch down, the bricks and stones of the past will shatter; in the future, a single punch could break down the city walls of a worldly dynasty. The sword you extended back then could help you escape danger and intimidate your foes, but in the future, perhaps your sword energy could shatter rivers and mountains, leaving the ancestral hall of a celestial sect in ruins. How can you be without fault? If you were Ma Kuxuan, an incredibly annoying person, or even Liu Xianyang, your best friend, you wouldn’t need to be so; yet precisely because of this, you are who you are today."

Zhu Lian pointed at Chen Ping'an, "You are you."

Zhu Lian drew a circle on the desk with his finger, smiling, "In the Book Lake, you have only managed to harmoniously coexist with your knowledge and reasoning in this world. You can solve problems and live practically while still finding some peace of mind without needing external validation. But the upcoming self-inquiry is to ask yourself, 'Who is Chen Ping'an?' Since you have chosen this path, whether right or wrong, you must first know it clearly and see it plainly, as only then can you correct your mistakes and perfect what is good; otherwise, everything will be in vain."

Zhu Lian raised his hand, pointing toward Chen Ping'an's head, "Earlier, you mentioned that Wei Bian said that one must have the sun and moon within their heart."

Zhu Lian's finger gradually moved down to indicate the shadow behind Chen Ping'an, "You also said that the national teacher Cui Zhan mentioned that a person’s heart should be as bright and radiant as the sun and moon, shouldn't you also take a look at the shadows behind you?"

Zhu Lian asked, "What do these two phrases convey?"

Zhu Lian answered his own question, "One refers to the future, and the other to the past. So, I have another question: how about the present? Who do you think you are? There’s a cliché that I, Zhu Lian, hold in high regard, which I can bring out to reflect on right now... This light and moonlight, 'To know others is wisdom; to know oneself is enlightenment.' What does 'enlightenment' mean? It signifies a bright and unblemished mindset, as well as the presence of both the sun and moon."

Chen Ping'an returned to his seat, drinking the wine, seemingly enlightened and relieved.

Zhu Lian concluded with a smile, "Some things cannot be fully understood by thinking; do not fear it, just move forward and take it slow. If there's a mistake, correct it; if there's no mistake, seek betterment. In the end, isn't all knowledge and effort rooted in action? You can go to Upside-Down Mountain, go to Tongye Continent, go to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, go to the Book Lake; a North Julu Continent rich in heroes should indeed be the place for Chen Ping'an to practice swordsmanship now. Bring a few more jars of wine; with your green shirt and sword, ride with your vigor to North Julu Continent, and by the time you return to the South, you may have already earned the title of a sword immortal, making the rivers and lakes remember the name Chen Ping'an for a hundred years or even a thousand!"

Chen Ping'an, before hearing Zhu Lian's words, was in deep agreement, but by the end, he couldn't help but feel a mix of amusement and helplessness; this was not something he would typically ponder.

Zhu Lian replied earnestly, "The world is full of infatuated beauties in the martial world, Young Master, so be careful."

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to agree; Zhu Lian, saying such things, seemed all too familiar with it.

Zhu Lian raised the wine jar, "Tonight, I enjoyed the conversation with you, Young Master. This old servant dares to finish the wine in the jar with you before leaving?"

This Zhu Lian felt even more familiar.

Chen Ping'an smiled as he picked up the wine jar, finishing the osmanthus wine together with Zhu Lian.

After Zhu Lian left with the empty wine jar, Chen Ping'an resumed packing his belongings.

The matter of the immortal coins was all stored in the jade token given by Zheng Dafeng back in Old Dragon City, along with the thirty grains of Gu Yu coins he had gotten back from Wei Bian, who helped "manage the finances." Under normal circumstances, he would never use them. Only when it came to the three life-saving items outside of water and soil would he consider using this money to buy a cherished and suitable magical artifact.

Additionally, he packed fifty small summer coins and one thousand snowflake coins.

As for the sword immortal, the sword-raising gourd was, naturally, carried on his person.

Wearing the blue robe named Spring Grass, he also brought the golden robe with him, as Zhu Lian suggested, for emergencies.

The walnut carving bracelet gifted by Wu Yi of Ziyang House, with each carved piece equivalent to a strike from an earth immortal, was a perfectly suitable offensive artifact for him.

The talisman for the Night Wanderer had already been damaged at its core. It was said that Brother Li Baoping was currently studying at North Julu Continent; he would see if it could be repaired. After that, whether the Li family would reclaim the talisman or Chen Ping'an would keep it would depend on Li Xisheng's decision. Although Cui Dongshan had subtly reminded him to distance himself from the Li family of Fulu Street, when it came to Li Xisheng, Chen Ping'an was still willing to get close.

He also packed three carefully crafted masks by Zhu Lian, representing youth, middle age, and old age. Although they wouldn't fool earth immortal cultivators, they were more than sufficient for traveling.

As for Li Er and his wife, and Li Huai's sister, Li Liu, whom Lin Shouyi and Dong Shuijing both favored, she should now be cultivating at Lion Peak in Julu Continent, and it was time to visit this family of three.

Finally, he personally planned to scout the route into the oceanic river, which was a deal made years ago with the Daoist sect leader Lu Chen, who had not consulted with Chen Ping'an at all. However, regardless of how it turned out, it was a bold move Chen Ping'an would not shy away from, as the future opportunities for the young boy Chen Lingjun's path to enlightenment hinged on this route.

Traveling through the waters, whether it be the likes of dragons and pythons or fish spirits, was never an easy task. The eel demon in Tongye Continent had its path to the river blocked by the river goddess, causing it to remain stuck at the golden core realm.

Of course, there were people and events he wanted to meet and those he would rather avoid, such as the once-revered immortal girl He Xiaoliang from the Divine Decree Sect.

Just thinking of this former Daoist girl, who once had unparalleled fortune on Baoping Continent, made him feel more troubled than thoughts of Yao Jin from Tongye Continent, the river goddess Xiao Luan, or even Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island combined.

He could only hope to avoid her at all costs.

After packing up for his journey to the North, Chen Ping'an let out a long sigh.

He couldn't help but think of the serious Zhu Lian.

What a remarkable presence.

He couldn't imagine what kind of immortal figure Zhu Lian had been back in his youth in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

Zhu Lian wandered over to the residence and found Cen Yanjuan, this silly girl, still practicing her punches. However, her punches lacked stability and were just her forcing herself to put in the effort without any finesse, which was rather unappealing.

He lightly tapped his toes, leaping over the wall and landing in the courtyard, saying, "Excessive effort can be counterproductive. Your punches lack control; this is troublesome. Practicing martial arts is akin to cultivating the heart. Working hard is good, but if you don’t know how to master the timing and balance, your punches will only grow stiff and might even make you foolish. If you continue this way day after day, carelessly injuring your foundation, how can you achieve great success?"

His words were rather blunt, and they echoed Chen Ping'an's drunken frankness when he told Cen Yanjuan, "Your punches are no good."

What was acceptable from the young master of the Desolate Mountain was another matter entirely when it came to Zhu Lian. Cen Yanjuan, who was devoted to Zhu Lian, immediately began to reflect on her shortcomings.

Zhu Lian nodded, "That said, if you can endure hardship yourself, that's already commendable. But since you are a named disciple of our Desolate Mountain, you must hold yourself in higher regard. You might as well practice your punches at the peak of Desolate Mountain from time to time, taking a look at the majestic scenery around you. Constantly remind yourself, who says a woman's heart can't encompass the beautiful mountains and rivers? Who says a woman can't reach the pinnacle of martial arts and gaze down at the heroes of the world?"

Cen Yanjuan's heart swayed, and she nearly teared up. After all, she was a girl who cherished her home. No wonder she respected Zhu Lian so much; not only did he save her from peril, but he also offered her a bright future in martial arts, treating her like a kind elder afterward. How could Cen Yanjuan not be moved? She wiped her tears and trembled as she said, "Every word you say, I will remember firmly."

Zhu Lian offered a few pointers before preparing to leave. Cen Yanjuan hesitated for a moment but couldn't help but ask, "Why do you endure humiliation and bear burdens here at Desolate Mountain?"

Zhu Lian chuckled, "How is it humiliation and burden?"

Cen Yanjuan fidgeted, feeling too shy to express her true thoughts. It wasn't that she feared the young master; rather, she worried that her careless words might offend Zhu Lian's dignity.

Zhu Lian pointed to Cen Yanjuan, "Fools have their own blessings. Let it be; it’s good as it is. No need to change, and the longer you maintain this, the better. Our Desolate Mountain ought to have someone like you."

Cen Yanjuan smiled slightly.

Zhu Lian, even when scolding her, was genuinely concerned.

Cen Yanjuan asked, "Do you find it comfortable living here?"

Zhu Lian nodded, "I, a wild man, am accustomed to living in the mountains. I'm a lazy fellow, and I couldn't be more comfortable."

Cen Yanjuan genuinely praised, "You are truly a carefree hermit, an otherworldly expert!"

Zhu Lian rubbed his chin, "The feng shui of Desolate Mountain is a bit strange."

This time, Zhu Lian didn't leap over the courtyard wall but left through the door.

After Cen Yanjuan locked the door, she gently clenched her fist and murmured, "Cen Yanjuan must not disappoint Zhu Laoxian's expectations! I must practice my punches hard and be more mindful!"

Zhu Lian didn't head straight back to the residence but went to the top of Desolate Mountain, sitting on the steps. He swayed the empty wine jar, only to remember it was empty. No matter; he would wait for the sunrise.

Suddenly, Zhu Lian glanced over and saw an unexpected person.

It was the rare sight of the barefoot old man, Cui Cheng, leaving the bamboo building.

Zhu Lian stood up, smiling wide in welcome.

Cui Cheng slowly climbed up, gesturing for Zhu Lian to sit down.

Zhu Lian plopped down without hesitation.

Cui Cheng sat beside Zhu Lian and surprisingly brought two jars of wine with him, tossing one to Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian opened the clay seal and took a hearty swig, laughing, "If Young Master finds out that Elder secretly dug out two jars of wine, he wouldn't dare to blame you but would have to scold me for 'guarding the treasure and stealing.'"

Cui Cheng replied flatly, "If Chen Ping'an dislikes someone, he wouldn't say a word; a single word would be too much."

Zhu Lian nodded, "That’s true."

Cui Cheng gazed into the distance and casually asked, "Zhu Lian, now that you’ve lost the bottleneck of the heavenly path in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, why do you still intentionally take it slow?"

Zhu Lian set down the two jars of wine, one on each side, leaning back with both elbows supporting him on the ground, lazily saying, "This is the most comfortable way to live."

Cui Cheng asked again, "Chen Ping'an is indeed not bad, but is he worth such treatment from you, Zhu Lian?"

Facing the inquiry from a peak martial artist of the Tenth Realm, Zhu Lian remained nonchalant, "I want to; I'm happy."

Cui Cheng didn't get angry, turning back to the bamboo building to practice more punches as he pleased.

Cui Cheng chuckled, "Do you always present yourself like this? Even your Young Master is kept in the dark?"

Zhu Lian grinned, "In my hometown, I rely on my looks for a living, but I’m full now; let’s just say no more. At my age, I should accept my age gracefully; what good would it do to make a bunch of young girls pine and worry?"

Cui Cheng shook his head and left.

There was really nothing else to talk about with this guy.

Had it not been for Zhu Lian's words on the first floor of the bamboo building, Cui Cheng wouldn't have made this trip to deliver a jar of wine.

After Cui Cheng left, Zhu Lian simply leaned back on the ground, resting his head on his hands, closing his eyes to relax.

As dawn approached, Zhu Lian slowly sat up, finding no one around. He extended two fingers to the side of his temple, gently peeling off a mask to reveal his true face.

Wei Bian appeared beside Zhu Lian without him noticing, glancing down at Zhu Lian, and remarked, "I feel embarrassed."

Zhu Lian covered his face, pretending to be a shy young girl, mimicking Pei Qian's tone, "How embarrassing."

Wei Bian held back a laugh for a long time before leaving, only muttering, "Disgusting!"

Zhu Lian burst into hearty laughter, standing up straight, hands clasped behind him.

As the sun rose over the eastern sea, it illuminated Zhu Lian, his spirit radiant, his aura flowing, as if he were an immortal among immortals.

Zhu Lian quickly covered his true face with the mask again, meticulously arranging it before picking up the two jars of wine and heading down the mountain, where Cen Yanjuan was practicing her punches while climbing.

Spotting the stooped old senior, she nearly broke her concentration, stopping her stance to greet him. However, thinking back to their heart-to-heart last night, Cen Yanjuan forced herself to hold her breath, maintaining her focus and continuing her punches.

Zhu Lian nodded as he brushed past her.

It wasn't until she reached the peak that Cen Yanjuan retracted her stance and turned back, faintly spotting the small, slender figure that resembled a grain of rice. The girl thought to herself, a man like Zhu Lian, even if not handsome in his youth, would certainly have been liked by many women, right?

Zhu Lian arrived at the residence of Pei Qian and Chen Ruchu, where the girl in the pink skirt had already begun her busy day.

Pei Qian was undoubtedly still sleeping in, as she would say, "The best friend in the world is the blanket at night; the hardest enemy to defeat is the bed in the morning." Fortunately, she was clear about her grievances.

Zhu Lian cheerfully greeted Chen Ruchu before knocking on the door with vigor. When Pei Qian groggily woke up and asked, "Who is it?"

Zhu Lian grinned, "Young Master has already left Desolate Mountain!"

Pei Qian's heart tightened, suddenly furious, "Zhu the Old Chef, Master is leaving on the cross-continental ferry tomorrow! Who are you trying to fool?!"

Zhu Lian replied, "Then you can continue sleeping."

Pei Qian sat up dazedly in bed and then shouted, "Zhu the Old Chef, you better not run away! If you have the skills, let me hit you with a full set of Crazy Sword Techniques without blinking!"

"I have no skills," Zhu Lian called back as he walked away.

Pei Qian found it hard to sleep or stay awake, rolling around in bed, beating the covers in frustration.

That day, Chen Ping'an left Desolate Mountain around noon, accompanied by Pei Qian. At the mountain gate, he chatted briefly with Zheng Dafeng, only to be driven away by Zheng Dafeng, who found the pair bothersome. Now that the construction of the mountain gate was nearing completion, Zheng Dafeng was quite busy, which only infuriated Pei Qian even more.

After that, Chen Ping'an took Pei Qian to the small town, first visiting the graves of his parents and then spending the night at the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, keeping a vigil.

The next morning, without letting Pei Qian follow, he headed directly to the ferry at Bull Horn Mountain. Wei Bian accompanied him as they boarded the cross-continental ferry to Bone Marsh. He informed Chen Ping'an, "Someone may want to see you on the way; in our Great Li, that person is quite esteemed."

Chen Ping'an understood but still felt suspicious, glancing at Wei Bian, who nodded slightly.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Don't worry, I can handle it."

Wei Bian replied, "Of course, I trust you; it's the territory of the North岳."

After Wei Bian disappeared from view, Chen Ping'an ignored the complex gazes surrounding him and made his way to the cabin on the top floor of the ship.

Upon entering the room, Chen Ping'an approached the railing of the viewing platform. As the ferry slowly ascended, he, dressed in a blue robe, carrying the sword of a sword immortal and with a gourd for raising swords at his waist, looked down at the landscape of the former Lihuzhu Cave, where the mountains and rivers stretched endlessly.

Once again, he was leaving home for thousands of miles.

On a misty cliff, carved into the stone were the four characters "Heaven Opens Divine Splendor."

A girl in a ponytail, dressed in blue, sat shoulder to shoulder with a small black charcoal figure on the horizontal stroke of the character "He."

Pei Qian swung her legs, which hung over the cliff, cheerfully boasting, "Sister Xiu Xiu, these two bags of twists are delicious, crispy and flaky; Master bought them from a very far place!"

Ruan Xiu also squinted her eyes with a smile, nodding, "Delicious."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 555: Long Time No See (Part 1)

The cross-continental ferry of the Skeleton Beach (Haigui Tan) sect, resembling the riverboats Chen Ping'an had taken in the past, bore no significant differences at first glance. However, once it took to the skies, its majestic form was enveloped in swirling mist, revealing ethereal armored warriors who, like boatmen, propelled the vessel through the sea of clouds. The ferry moved at incredible speeds, far surpassing the old ferry Chen had once traveled on to Da Jia Mountain.

Chen Ping'an had set aside his Sword Immortal and the Sword Nurturing Gourd on the table, practicing his punches in the quiet cabin. Occasionally, he would take out a few bamboo slips to admire the scenery from the observation deck. One particular yellowed slip caught his attention, inscribed with the words "In tranquility, clarity; in action, decisiveness." The dual meanings of "tranquility" and "decisiveness" resonated deeply with him.

Despite receiving a jade bamboo fan from Cui Dongshan as a parting gift, Chen Ping'an couldn't shake off the memory of a certain renowned figure he had encountered during his travels. The man had lounged in a rattan chair, fanning himself in the cool breeze, and Chen Ping'an felt that the fan had fallen into his hands rather unfairly. He simply couldn't imagine himself waving it without feeling awkward.

Once the ferry glided out of the borders of the Liyu Blessed Land, it made a brief stop at the Changchun Palace (Changchun Gong) ferry terminal, located to the north of the capital of the Great Li (Dali) dynasty. Changchun Palace was a premier immortal dwelling of the Great Li, known for being inhabited solely by women. After the palace matriarch fell from her position, she retreated here to cultivate. The court of the Great Li had assumed that this distant matriarch would soon be unable to rise again, but they were unaware that she would ultimately emerge as the greatest winner, giving birth to two sons. One, supported by the national master Cui Zhan, ascended to the throne as the new emperor, while the other, the prince Song Changjing, was poised for a princely title in the old Dragon City, indirectly leading the capital.

After the death of the former emperor, she had been "confined" and seemingly achieved the best outcome without any overt actions.

It was no wonder the common folk often muttered that good people are rewarded, though deep down, they rarely believed it.

Chen Ping'an's way of keeping accounts differed from Gu Can and Pei Qian; he didn't jot everything down on paper, for the sheer volume would blur the important details. When Chen Ping'an first set out on his travels, that ambitious Great Li matriarch had sent a squad of top assassins to follow him. If not for encountering Ah Liang, he would have met a gruesome fate.

Of course, the matriarch had her reasons. Her son Song Jixin had suffered significantly at Chen Ping'an's hands, nearly being killed by the apprentice in a rain-drenched alley.

After passing through the Lotus Flower Blessed Land and the Scroll Lake, Chen Ping'an had begun to piece together the matriarch's story.

Clearly, this powerful Great Li matriarch had started plotting during her rise to power, nurturing her son Song He in the capital, helping him build his influence and win over both civil and military officials. As for Song Jixin, who had been fortunate enough to have the Song clan's fortunes "prosper," his endeavors in Liyu Cave had yielded whatever benefits he could muster. If he were to die, she would likely shed a few tears, but the name of her younger son Song Mu had long been crossed out on the clan's genealogy, and his death would hardly matter—just another death to account for. However, Song Jixin's achievements were at least partially attributable to their mother. Her contributions naturally reflected on her other son Song He. These internal machinations might not be known by the high-ranking officials of the Great Li, but it didn’t matter; the former emperor recognized it, Cui Zhan recognized it, and Song Changjing would also acknowledge it—this was sufficient.

For Song Jixin to leave Liyu Cave alive was a fortuitous outcome, provided Song Mu, whose name had been reinstated in the family tree, remained humble and did not covet his brother's throne.

Thus, when Chen Ping'an and Song Jixin crossed paths at the Cliffside Academy, it was a chance encounter without any conflict.

During their time as neighbors, Song Jixin had often made sarcastic remarks about Chen Ping'an's household, claiming that the only sounds emanating from the large residence were the clinking of jars and the only fragrance lingering in the air was that of medicinal herbs.

Despite tricking Chen Ping'an into breaking his oath on one occasion, the two generally coexisted peacefully, merely eyeing each other warily, their paths never truly intersecting. In the bustling alleys of Mud Bottle Lane (Niping Xiang) and Apricot Blossom Alley (Xinghua Xiang), their occasional jabs at each other were as light as feathers—hardly worth anyone's concern, let alone causing any real trouble. In fact, it was during those days that Song Jixin had learned the hard way not to take the gossip of the townsfolk too seriously, as he had become ensnared by his own insecurities.

As the ferry approached the capital of Great Li that night, the moon hung bright in a starry sky. Chen Ping'an sat on the railing of the observation deck, gazing up at the heavens while sipping his drink.

In his youth, Chen Ping'an feared sickness more than anything. After becoming adept at foraging for herbs on the mountain, he later apprenticed as a kiln worker, learning pottery from the cantankerous Old Yao. He became hyper-aware of any sign of illness; the moment he felt unwell, he would rush to the mountains to gather herbs and brew medicine. Liu Xianyang often joked that Chen Ping'an was the most delicate person under the sky, thinking he had the body of a pampered young lady from Fortune and Prosperity Street (Fulujie).

His childhood fears were deeply rooted; he had watched helplessly as his mother fell ill, with no remedy in sight, her body withering away until she passed on a snowy day. Chen Ping'an was terrified that if he died, no one would remember his parents.

His mother had always said that being sick didn’t hurt much—it just made you sleepy, urging young Ping'an not to worry. At first, he believed her, only realizing later that it was her way of comforting him, forcing herself to endure.

That old, tattered quilt had frayed at the corners, remnants of a once warm cocoon.

Rich families often said their children matured early and would achieve great things. Meanwhile, poor families had no choice but to have their children grow up faster, suffering sooner.

In Mud Bottle Lane, no one paid any mind to the small child standing on a stool cooking, choked by the smoke yet smiling through tears. What could a child alone, running to the Immortal’s Tomb to pray for blessings, fear? Did he tremble at the ghost stories swirling around the markets? Kneeling before the deities, he would bow his head, promising to repay the incense offerings once he grew up—was that not sincerity?

No one remembered the day a door creaked open, the woman inside biting back screams of pain, muffled sounds escaping through clenched teeth as she struggled with the blanket.

Outside, a pale-faced child squatted helplessly, hands over his ears, too afraid to cry out, fearful that his mother would discover he knew.

Not all bonds between the closest of kin could share joy and sorrow.

Coming too early isn’t always a blessing.

The night before their journey, while keeping vigil at the ancestral home, Pei Qian dozed off, only to wake suddenly, startled to find her master shedding silent tears.

Pei Qian said nothing, quietly watching her master.

In her mind's eye, she could faintly see a young figure squatting in the corner, staring at the medicine jars.

That young version of her master feared growing up, feared tomorrow, almost wishing for time to rewind back to the days of family togetherness.

Finally, Chen Ping'an snapped back to reality, gently ruffling Pei Qian's hair, speaking softly, "It's nothing, just a bit of regret. My mother won’t see today. You don't know, but when she smiled, she was truly beautiful. Everyone in Mud Bottle Lane and Apricot Blossom Alley would say that my father was fortunate to marry such a wonderful woman."

That night, in the later hours, Pei Qian rested her head on her master’s lap and drifted off to sleep.

The next day, Chen Ping'an departed once more from his hometown.

Traveling thousands of miles, he still felt connected to his homeland, not as a place he could forget, but a place he must return to.

After Chen Ping'an left, the atmosphere at the Fallen Star Mountain (Luopo Shan) grew noticeably quieter.

Old Cui Cheng stayed hidden away, while Zheng Dafeng busied himself at the mountain gate, his hair unkempt. It was no surprise; this fellow liked to lend a hand to the craftsmen, who found his behavior quite normal. Even though the master of Fallen Star Mountain, rumored to have an impressive background, was now experiencing great fortune, the gossip circulating about him was met with neither jealousy nor resentment, only admiration and respect. A kiln apprentice from Mud Bottle Lane achieving such success was no small feat, indicating a considerable amount of skill.

Yet this hunchbacked fellow, Zheng, who merely stood watch at the door, was not much better off than the laborers, so interactions were relaxed and casual. They would tease each other and engage in light banter, creating a harmonious atmosphere. Zheng Dafeng's humor had a certain spice, unlike the crude talk of most men in the markets; it was playful without being overly refined. Thus, when they gathered at the table, sharing drinks and hearty meals, conversations would occasionally reach a point where they would slam their hands on the table, praising Zheng as a true brother.

Chen Ruchu was busy tidying up the various residences, even though the Fallen Star Mountain was pristine and clean. Yet she took immense pleasure in her work, viewing it as a priority, while her cultivation was pushed to the back burner.

The girl in the pink skirt was the only one with keys to all the residences at Fallen Star Mountain—neither Chen Ping'an nor Zhu Lian had access.

Chen Lingjun remained carefree, wandering about. Having made quite an impression at the Night Banquet, he garnered a few more "friends" in the world of cultivation. Various sects were notably eager to host this blue-clad youth who could sit among the esteemed guests. For instance, the Gold Core Earth Immortal of the Yidai Peak (Yidai Feng) was particularly fond of Chen Lingjun visiting. The two, one old and one young, would drink and chat, boasting about their past exploits—a delightful match. Chen Ping'an had privately advised Chen Lingjun that Yidai Peak was a place worth frequenting, thus giving Lingjun the confidence to claim he had an official mandate to make friends.

After delivering two bags of fried dough twists to Sister Xiuxiu, Pei Qian recalled her master's instructions. She accompanied Chen Lingjun to Yidai Peak, bringing along the young girl Zhu Qionglin, who cradled a young white fox. Liu Yunrun, who loved to join in the fun, tagged along to Fallen Star Mountain. However, every time the dark-skinned girl tried to pet the little creature, the white fox would shrink back, trembling, leaving Pei Qian feeling embarrassed. She couldn't understand why the little thing was so fearful; after all, her intentions were innocent. It was just a thought—if she skinned it, it would surely fetch a good price, but she had no intention of harming it.

Zhu Lian, while entertaining guests, reminded Pei Qian that it was time for her to attend school. Pei Qian, with her head held high, ignored the suggestion, saying she wanted to take Zhu Qionglin to Sister Xiuxiu's Dragon Spring Sword Sect (Longquan Jianzong) for some fun.

Zhu Lian smiled and replied, "Then I’ll give you five days to play around; you should finish visiting your own place and Miss Ruan's mountains."

Pei Qian began negotiating with Zhu Lian, and in the end, Zhu Lian reluctantly added two more days. Pei Qian was overjoyed, feeling as if she had struck a bargain.

In fact, when Chen Ping'an had spoken to Zhu Lian, he had predicted that Pei Qian would dawdle, so he intended to let her procrastinate an extra ten days or half a month. After that, whether she liked it or not, she would have to go to school.

Thus, the clever little fox had met her match in the wily old fox, and the gap in their abilities was evident.

Just days ago, Pei Qian had been full of energy, happily exploring the sights with her walking staff, leading Zhu Qionglin and Liu Yunrun through the western mountains she knew so well.

Having spent so much effort chasing dogs, her diligence had certainly paid off.

At the Dragon Spring Sword Sect, the once fearless Liu Yunrun felt a bit shy, especially upon meeting the blue-clad woman, the fabled daughter of the Sage Ruan Qiong. They all appeared respectful and humble in her presence. Pei Qian could hardly suppress her laughter, forcing herself to maintain a serious demeanor. When Ruan Xiu glanced at the two unfamiliar girls, she smiled at Pei Qian, who sprinted over. Ruan Xiu naturally bent down, and Pei Qian whispered in her ear, "My master doesn't particularly like them and is adamantly against them visiting Fallen Star Mountain. However, he has a favorable impression of a young cultivator named Song Yuan from Yidai Peak, so he allowed me, his foremost disciple, to bring them for a visit."

Ruan Xiu chuckled.

The forging of swords had momentarily ceased as she personally led the way, leaving Zhu Qionglin and Liu Yunrun in awe. The former felt that this unexpected stroke of fortune was enough to earn her countless benefits upon returning to her sect. Yet, knowing that this friendly and warm-hearted woman was the only daughter of the chief patron of the Great Li dynasty, she realized that upon returning to the Qingmei Temple, she would need to be subtler in her dealings, to avoid turning good fortune into misfortune.

Liu Yunrun, being more innocent, admired Ruan Xianzi deeply, having heard of her grandfather's legacy as an Earth Immortal. She was enamored by the grandeur and warmth of the sage's daughter.

Now, Ruan Xianzi was widely known as the Earth Immortal Dong Gu, yet there was little she could do about it; the only one brave enough to mention her sister's name was her master, and even that bore little significance.

During this time, Pei Qian indulged in three days of carefree fun, living a fairy-like life. By the fourth day, however, her little black fox began to worry, and by the fifth day, it was already feeling unwell. On the sixth day, it felt as though the world was crumbling. By the final day, as she returned from Yidai Peak, her spirits were low, dragging her walking staff behind her. Zheng Dafeng, rarely one to initiate conversation, greeted her, but Pei Qian merely nodded in response, quietly making her way up the mountain.

The next day, Pei Qian eagerly approached Chef Zhu, stating that she would head down the mountain alone, assuring him she wouldn’t get lost.

Zhu Lian agreed.

To show her sincerity, Pei Qian dashed down the mountain. However, once she was a safe distance from Fallen Star Mountain, she began to stroll leisurely, checking the stream to see if there were any fish, climbing trees to take in the view, and when she reached the small town, she didn’t rush to Qi Long Alley but instead paused by the Longxu River to skip stones. When she grew tired, she sat on a large blue stone, eating sunflower seeds, and it was only when night fell that she happily made her way to Qi Long Alley. But when she saw Zhu Lian sitting on a small stool at the entrance, it felt as if lightning had struck her.

Pei Qian immediately pretended to limp, leaning on her walking staff, wearing a pained expression. "Chef Zhu, on my way down, I tripped and fell, and it took me a while to get here."

Zhu Lian replied with an "oh," "It’s fine, take care of your injury. I’ll write a letter to your master, saying you hurt your leg, and you should hold off on going to school for now."

Pei Qian frowned, plopping down on the threshold. Inside the shop, Shi Rou was busy with the abacus, causing Pei Qian to grumble, “Tomorrow, I’m going to school. No matter if it rains or snows, nothing can stop me.”

Zhu Lian smiled and asked, "Shall I take you to school, or should Sister Shi Rou?"

Pei Qian thought for a moment, forcing a smile. "Let Sister Shi Rou take me; you have too much to do on the mountain."

Unexpectedly, Shi Rou spoke up softly, "I won’t be going. It’s better if he takes you to school."

Pei Qian rolled her eyes at the inconsiderate girl, thinking that she wouldn’t get any more sunflower seeds from her in the future.

Shi Rou sighed softly.

It wasn’t that she was too lazy to take that short journey; it was that she felt a bit intimidated.

Shi Rou genuinely didn’t want to go to the Chen clan’s school in Longwei County, even though she had once nervously entered the Great Sui Cliffside Academy. In truth, she held a strong aversion to such scholarly places filled with the sounds of learning. It stemmed not only from a fear of the supernatural but also from a deep-seated inferiority.

But in this regard, Chen Ping'an held the best impression of Shi Rou.

Wearing the shell of a celestial being, Shi Rou was bound to feel proud. Thus, during her time at the academy, she had initially viewed the children like Li Baoping and Li Huai, as well as the young boys and girls like Yu Lu and Xie Xie, as lacking in discernment, looking down on them. Of course, later on, she faced plenty of hardships with Cui Dongshan. But aside from her perspective, it was her mentality and her reverence for the world of academia that were truly precious.

Cen Yuanji felt the same way; she also possessed her own invaluable qualities, even if she was unaware of them. After climbing the mountain, she understood that the immortal she revered was simply an old servant of Chen Ping'an, no more than a steward in a grand estate. Yet throughout, Cen Yuanji remained grateful to Zhu Lian and was always ready to defend him.

These often-overlooked acts of kindness were what Chen Ping'an hoped Pei Qian would discover—the goodness in others.

Chen Ping'an never insisted that Pei Qian should act in a certain way, but he wanted her to be aware.

Chen Ping'an never left even a grain of rice on his plate, but Pei Qian, Zheng Dafeng, and Zhu Lian had no such scruples. If they had too much food, they would simply "save it for later." Chen Ping'an didn’t make a fuss about it, nor did he feel that they needed to change.

This was a small matter.

But it was also not a trivial one.

In fact, this was something Chen Ping'an himself didn’t recognize as valuable.

Yet, in those days, Gu Can and Liu Xianyang likely only felt comfortable and at ease in Chen Ping'an's presence, despite knowing he was quite rigid and stubborn.

However, in the eyes of the "seniors" like Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng, it was clear, even if they chose not to say anything.

Just like how Chen Ping'an, in making important decisions, always sought the opinions of Sui Youbian, Shi Rou, and Pei Qian first, even when he was the one offering kindness.

This calm and collected demeanor wasn’t something he learned from books or intentionally acquired; it stemmed from his upbringing and the trials of life, forged through hardship.

In the end, it was Zhu Lian who accompanied Pei Qian to school.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 556: Long Time No See (Part 2)

Early in the morning, Pei Qian stood with her arms crossed, her face set in a frown as she stared blankly at a table full of her beloved belongings. 

Aside from the small bamboo box already strapped to her back, she couldn’t take anything else—neither the walking stick on the table, nor the yellow paper talismans, nor her bamboo sword and bamboo saber! What a load of nonsense this school was, what a joke of a lesson, and what a ridiculous teacher!

Pei Qian let out a heavy sigh, stood up, opened the door, and lifted her head. At that moment, she felt a flicker of enlightenment, finally grasping the essence of the sage's saying, “Though a million stand against me, I will forge ahead.”

However, she had secretly stashed away a handful of sunflower seeds. Of course, she couldn’t dare eat them in class, not with the risk of the school reporting her to the desolate mountain. Pei Qian knew that she wouldn’t have a leg to stand on if that happened; her master would certainly not come to her aid. But in her free time, she couldn't neglect herself, right? Wasn’t it permissible to find a secluded spot to crack some seeds?

As Pei Qian walked along, she remained silent. While wandering the streets, she spotted a large white goose. Before she could react, the goose took off, flapping its wings in a panic. 

Pei Qian’s mood lightened a bit. Soon, she would be leaving the martial world behind, yet here was this troublesome creature, fully aware of her prowess.

Zhu Lian accompanied Pei Qian to the school’s entrance, advising, “Argue more, fight less.”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes. “What’s there to argue about? I’ll just be a little mute, then.”

Zhu Lian waved goodbye.

Feeling a bit awkward, Pei Qian’s legs felt a little uncooperative. So what if she was a day late to her studies? It wasn’t a big deal. She turned her head to glance back, only to see Zhu Lian still standing there. Pei Qian felt annoyed; this old chef was really too idle. He should hurry back to Desolate Mountain to cook!

At the school, a young teacher was already waiting, smiling brightly. 

The young mountain lord from Desolate Mountain had already communicated with the school. The two old teachers from the Chen family of Longtail Creek had calculated that this matter was not trivial and decided to send a letter back to their clan. The eldest son, Chen Songfeng, personally replied, instructing the school to treat the matter with propriety—no need for undue hostility or flattery, but rules must be upheld, while some matters could be handled with leniency.

Pei Qian wasn’t actually shy; after all, as a child in the border town of Fox Town during the Daqing Dynasty, she had managed to fool several seasoned captains without uttering a harsh word, receiving their courteous escort back to the inn.

Pei Qian simply didn’t enjoy studying.

The young teacher introduced Pei Qian simply as “Pei Qian, from Qilong Alley.”

When the students heard her name, which sounded like “losing money,” laughter erupted in the classroom. The young teacher frowned, and an older teacher who was responsible for imparting knowledge immediately reprimanded the class, restoring silence.

Pei Qian didn’t care. She quickly noted everyone’s appearance out of the corner of her eye, thinking that they would regret it if they crossed her.

She took a seat at an empty desk, placing her bamboo box beside her, and pretended to listen to the lesson.

After enduring two classes and feeling drowsy, Pei Qian seized the opportunity after class to sneak out, not heading toward the main entrance of the school but quietly making her way toward a side door.

To her dismay, she found Zhu Lian sitting on the roadside, cracking sunflower seeds.

Pei Qian forced a smile, looking around and asking, “What are you doing here, Old Chef Zhu?”

Zhu Lian chuckled as he cracked seeds, “Waiting for rabbits by the stump.”

Pei Qian laughed, “This isn’t the deep woods; where would the little brothers come from?”

With that, she turned to leave.

Zhu Lian was like a ghost that wouldn’t leave her alone. It seemed today wasn’t a good day to skip class.

Over the next few days, every time Pei Qian thought about escaping, Zhu Lian would appear. 

In the end, she had to resign herself to her fate. Although Pei Qian wasn’t particularly young anymore, she looked no different from a ten-year-old child, so her classmates were indeed younger than her.

Pei Qian began to adapt to the life of studying at the school. When the teacher spoke, she would listen, letting the words flow in one ear and out the other. After class, she would cross her arms, close her eyes to rest, ignoring the bewildered expressions of her classmates, who were utterly clueless. She found no satisfaction in deceiving them.

That day, Pei Qian began to daydream again during class.

Suddenly, she turned her head and saw a young gentleman in a scholar's robe approaching, flanked by a few older teachers.

They didn’t stop, but Pei Qian noticed that this young man cast a glance her way.

That evening, Pei Qian declined the invitation of two young girls, and alone with her bamboo box, she hurried back to Qilong Alley. 

To her surprise, Zhu Lian was already in the back courtyard of the shop, and not only that, the young gentleman she had seen earlier at the school was there too, laughing and chatting with Old Chef Zhu.

Pei Qian bowed slightly, “Hello, sir.”

There was no helping it; since her master was a wanderer in the martial world, etiquette was essential. As the top disciple, she couldn’t let others think her master didn’t teach her well.

The young scholar smiled, “You must be Pei Qian. How are you finding your studies at the school?”

Pei Qian nodded earnestly, her eyes sincere, and replied loudly, “Very well indeed! The teachers have great knowledge, and truly, they should be in the academy as gentlemen and sages. My classmates are diligent in their studies; I’m sure they will all become successful scholars in the future!”

Shirou, at the counter, stifled a laugh. 

Zhu Lian didn’t expose her knack for opportunism. 

The young scholar seemed a bit taken aback. 

This flattery was a bit much, leaving the direct descendant of the Chen family from Longtail Creek at a loss for words. But since children speak frankly, he couldn’t dismiss her goodwill either, so he just smiled and nodded.

Pei Qian bowed again and then dashed into her room, gently closing the door, and began to copy texts. This task outside of school was where she truly focused her efforts.

After finishing her copying, Pei Qian discovered that the guest had already left, while Zhu Lian was still sitting in the courtyard, holding several items.

With her walking stick in hand, Pei Qian practiced the Mad Sword Technique, then asked, “What’s up?”

Zhu Lian replied, “Good news.”

Pei Qian blinked her eyes, “What, are they sending money over?”

Zhu Lian laughed, “Oh, you really hit the nail on the head this time.”

Pei Qian asked, “Can I get a cut?”

“Not your share.”

Zhu Lian raised one of the three boxes he held, shook his head, and explained, “A friend of your master’s, Liu Xianyang, who is studying in the Misty Continent, sent us a letter along with three items—two were sent and one was stored. The letter mentioned that one of the gifts is a book for the young master, containing a rare ‘Turning Pages Wind’ technique. The second item is a bamboo fan made from the divine bamboo for Gu Can of Mud Bottle Alley, saying that Gu Can has been timid since childhood, and the fan can suppress all the ghostly creatures that grow underground. As for the last item, Liu Xianyang heard that the young master has established his own mountain, so he entrusted a highly ranked ink-eating squid to the young master for care.”

Pei Qian beamed with delight, giving a thumbs up, “This Liu Xianyang is quite generous! He truly deserves to be my master’s best friend—spending lavishly and not being stingy!”

Zhu Lian smiled, “Besides being a friend, he’s also a wise person. It seems this journey for knowledge hasn’t been in vain. It’s good like this; otherwise, after so many years apart, with different circumstances, we would have nothing to talk about upon meeting again.”

Pei Qian asked, “Can I take a look at the Turning Pages Wind and the ink-eating squid?”

Zhu Lian stood up, saying, “The Turning Pages Wind is not to be moved for now. We can discuss it when the young master returns to Desolate Mountain. As for that ink-eating squid, I’ll take care of it first. When you visit Desolate Mountain next time, you can have a look.”

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “Was this money from our family or did Liu Xianyang pay for it?”

Zhu Lian laughed, “The letter said plainly that it’s for the young master to pay. It noted that you are now a big landlord, so don’t be stingy with this little silver. If you are truly concerned, then just endure it.”

Pei Qian huffed, “Easier said than done! Hurry up and return the ink-eating squid! Shi Rou and I are watching two shops in Qilong Alley, and we only earn a dozen taels of silver a month!”

Zhu Lian squinted at her, “You think you can just go tell your master yourself?”

Pei Qian immediately forced a smile, “Sending a message with a flying sword costs money. What’s there to say? Let’s leave it at that. Liu Xianyang is probably reluctant to speak up, so I’ll handle it from now on.”

Zhu Lian scoffed, “You? By then, the whole Desolate Mountain will hear your flattery!”

Pei Qian sat on the steps, sulking in silence.

Zhu Lian didn’t mind her; after all, she was just a child. Whether she was happy or sad, it was all the same.

Soon, more and more visitors came to Desolate Mountain.

Even Zhu Lian was somewhat surprised.

One of them was Lu Baixiang, who not only arrived but also brought along two additional burdens.

At the time, Zhu Lian was at the mountain gate, enjoying the sun with Zheng Dafeng. 

Lu Baixiang was not unfamiliar with Zheng Dafeng and simply dragged a stool over to sit beside him.

This left the sibling pair who revered their master as if he were a deity a bit puzzled.

An old man and a hunchbacked man showed no sign of respect or fear when they met their master.

The young girl with a wooden spear slung over her shoulder, however, emitted a cold demeanor, her sharpness only intensifying.

But Lu Baixiang cared little for such things; as for the two following him, they naturally wouldn’t mind either.

After some casual conversation, it turned out that Lu Baixiang had paused in the central south of the Bottle Continent, where he had gathered a group of desperate bandits from the border—remnants of a defeated nation in the southernmost vassal of the Zhuying Dynasty. Later, Lu Baixiang led them to seize a hilltop, which was the hidden lair of a demonic cult, isolated from the world, with considerable wealth. During this time, Lu Baixiang took in this brother-sister pair as his disciples. The girl, named Yuan Bao, was spirited and fierce, while her brother, Yuan Lai, was gentle and studious, with good potential for martial arts, though not as sharp as his sister.

Lu Baixiang considered them a lucky find, bringing them back to Desolate Mountain to broaden their horizons, leaving it up to his two disciples to decide whether to return to the martial world or stay on the mountain.

Upon hearing that Chen Pingan had just left Desolate Mountain to head toward Northern Julu Continent, Lu Baixiang felt a tinge of regret.

He would miss a hearty drink with a good friend.

Lu Baixiang planned to stay at Desolate Mountain for a month or so.

There was no shortage of residences on the mountain; as Zhu Lian put it, the family business was thriving now.

Zhu Lian told Lu Baixiang to find a house on his own while he chatted with Zheng Dafeng.

Lu Baixiang smiled as he rose to take his leave, with Zheng Dafeng inviting him to drink whenever he could. Lu Baixiang readily agreed.

Yuan Bao scoffed softly.

Yuan Lai seemed a bit shy.

As they ascended the mountain, Lu Baixiang felt a wave of emotion. This trip to the fabled land of Lihua had extended his thoughts and insights in ways that these two children could not compare.

Yuan Bao wore a cold expression, radiating a sharp aura.

Yuan Lai was fearful of his decisive sister, walking a step behind her while their master led the way.

Lu Baixiang didn’t look back, smiling as he said, “That hunchbacked man is Zhu Lian, now a wandering martial artist.”

The girl thought she must have heard wrong.

Lu Baixiang continued, “And that man who looks at you with a glimmer in his eye is Zheng Dafeng. When I first met him at a pharmacy in the Old Dragon City, he was already a peak martial artist, just a step away from reaching the tenth level.”

Yuan Bao pressed her lips together tightly.

Lu Baixiang, with a narrow blade at his waist and dressed in white, continued climbing, slowly saying, “What I’m telling you is not to make you fear them. Your master doesn’t think there’s any reason to feel humble around them. As for reaching the pinnacle of martial arts, your master remains somewhat confident. I just want you to understand one thing: there are always greater mountains and skies beyond. If you want to speak boldly in the future, you need sufficient skill; otherwise, you’ll just become a laughingstock. If you lose face, it’s fine; but if you lose mine, after one or two times, I’ll teach you how to be a disciple.”

Yuan Bao raised an eyebrow, “Rest assured, Master! One day, you will acknowledge that taking me as your disciple was the right decision!”

Yuan Lai chuckled quietly.

His sister had always been competitive since childhood.

Suddenly, Lu Baixiang stopped and turned around, looking down at the girl. “One thing you must remember: when you meet a person named Chen Pingan, be sure to be polite.”

Yuan Bao’s forehead broke into a fine sheen of sweat, and she nodded earnestly, “Got it!”

After Lu Baixiang and his two disciples settled down, the matter of incorporating Yuan Bao and Yuan Lai into the “Ancestral Hall” could only be temporarily shelved since the mountain lord was away.

On this matter, Lu Baixiang and Zhu Lian were of one mind—bringing students to Desolate Mountain meant registering them under its name without discussion.

Afterward, another trio visited Desolate Mountain.

They included a blind old man, a limping young man carrying a banner, and a round-faced girl nicknamed Little Jiu.

However, the three first went to the Qilong Alley shop, with Pei Qian leading the way back to Desolate Mountain together.

The blind old man felt a bit anxious inside. Upon hearing that Chen Pingan was not on the mountain, he felt unsure about seeking refuge. But after discussing with Zhu Lian from Desolate Mountain, he felt much more at ease. After their conversation, the blind old man realized that he seemed to have gained some standing. Though he wasn’t technically a resident of Desolate Mountain yet, he was receiving a stipend as an honored guest while staying at the Qilong Alley shop. As for his two disciples, they could only earn guest status after reaching the fifth realm, but before that, Desolate Mountain would offer them financial support, allowing them to advance with a portion of divine money. These matters were easy to negotiate.

It was a matter of mutual benefit, both in terms of personal connections and business. 

The key was that even a blind old man could see a bright future ahead.

This made the old blind man feel as if he had drunk a big bowl of iced wine on a hot summer day, his whole being relaxed. 

As he left Desolate Mountain, he felt like he was floating.

After all, Zhu Lian, the manager of Desolate Mountain, insisted on personally escorting them all the way to the mountain gate.

Pei Qian still accompanied the three as they left Desolate Mountain. Making the trip back and forth didn’t feel tiresome, especially since she could reunite with Xiao Bai, play around, and have a good time.

At this moment, Pei Qian turned her head and saw the old chef, his hands clasped behind him, leisurely climbing the mountain.

Pei Qian scratched her head, standing atop that tall building in the old chef’s heart, as if a vaguely familiar young man appeared. There was a term in books that described it—“clothes fluttering in the wind”—roughly conveying that feeling.

In the Lihua Fabled Land, in the capital of the Nanyuan Kingdom.

In a damp alley, a tall, jade-like young man in a green shirt walked slowly, holding an old oil-paper umbrella.

Today, he intended to borrow some books from his teacher, Zong Qiu, who was also the national teacher of the Nanyuan Kingdom, to read some rare texts that could not be found anywhere else in the world.

Regarding the imperial examination, his teacher had already stated that whether he could achieve the top three in the palace examination depended on fate. Given his young age, the court and the emperor had some concerns, but scoring in the second tier was definitely not a problem.

Therefore, he was now focusing less on the imperial examination and more on digging up many long-forgotten ancient texts.

After conversing with his teacher, Zong Qiu allowed him to peruse that portion of private collection.

At the corner of the street, a familiar face long unseen appeared.

He was extraordinarily handsome, smiling as he gazed at the umbrella-wielding youth.

With one hand behind his back and holding a folding fan, he gently tapped his abdomen.

It was Lu Tai.

The most renowned Young Master Lu in the world.

The youth revealed a brilliant smile and quickly walked over.

Over the years, Zong Qiu occasionally mentioned this “foreigner” who had disappeared from the capital after leaving, always with a heavy heart—neither enemy nor friend, yet somehow both, a relationship that was quite complex.

However, for the young man, this Mr. Lu was an important figure whom he admired and respected.

Lu Tai assessed the young man in the green shirt and remarked, “Peach and plum spring winds over a cup of wine, rivers and lakes night rains for a decade’s lamp. This saying fits perfectly, doesn’t it, Xia Qinglang? Has it been ten years since we last met?”

Cao Qinglang folded his umbrella, bowed, and then held the umbrella for Lu Tai, smiling, “I often hear about your exploits in the martial world, Mr. Lu.”

In these ten years, the martial world and battlefields had been tumultuous, a sea of blood and chaos.

This Mr. Lu had unified the demonic sects, and his few disciples had either become powerful leaders in the demonic path or were pillars of the border troops or renowned national advisors capable of summoning the wind and rain.

Not long ago, Mr. Lu had officially challenged the number one person in the world, intending to face that transcendent figure renowned for not losing to the demonic leader Ding Ying in the slightest, the immortal Yu Zhenyi.

Ten years—short yet long.

The enmities and friendships arising from Mr. Lu’s actions were numerous.

But Cao Qinglang simply focused on studying and… quietly cultivating, watching over this alley and this ancestral home.

Lu Tai waved his hand, signaling that there was no need for Cao Qinglang to hold the umbrella for him.

Cao Qinglang stepped aside, holding the umbrella himself, not insisting.

With Mr. Lu, there was never any need for formality.

The two walked together down the desolate street, and Lu Tai asked with a smile, “Do you have any plans?”

Cao Qinglang gently raised the oil-paper umbrella, shifting it back, and then looked up, “I want to go out and meet Mr. Chen.”

Lu Tai chuckled, “That won’t be easy. Just reading books won’t work. Even if you learned the punches from Master Zong and picked up some fragmented immortal techniques he helped you find, it still won’t be enough.”

Cao Qinglang smiled, “In books, there is the White Jade Capital, a tower forty-eight thousand feet high, where the immortal leans on the railing and gazes at the lotus.”

Lu Tai turned to look, “That foolish expression does resemble him.”

Cao Qinglang finally revealed a hint of youthful innocence, joyfully saying, “Really? Is it a bit similar?”

Lu Tai teased, “Is it worth being so proud that you resemble him to some extent? Do you know that if you were in my and his hometown, your talent for cultivation would be considered remarkable? He, however, only has the potential for the earth immortals. To put it simply, according to common sense, his highest achievement in life will only be slightly better than the current worthless immortal Yu Zhenyi. You were young back then, and the Lihua Fabled Land wasn’t as rich in spiritual energy and conducive to cultivation as it is now. So he hurriedly made a trip, which made him appear quite dazzling. If it were now, it would be much more difficult.”

Cao Qinglang shook his head, pointing to the highest point of the sky. This young man in a green shirt, full of spirit, proclaimed, “Mr. Chen is higher than the heavens and beyond!”

Lu Tai chuckled in disbelief.

Well, Chen Pingan, you really are something. After a trip to the Daoist Temple, you’ve managed to inspire such admiration from this little fool.

Lu Tai’s expression turned serious, “Do you know that even the matter of ascension from your hometown still carries great risks?”

Cao Qinglang nodded, “So if one day in the future, should I end up failing like the sages of old, I would trouble Mr. Lu to send a message saying, ‘Cao Qinglang has lived well all these years, but I do miss you, sir.’”

Lu Tai sighed, snapping his fan shut, he playfully struck Cao Qinglang’s head, “If you have the ability, go tell him yourself!”

Cao Qinglang, holding the umbrella in one hand and rubbing his head with the other, helplessly replied, “Well, I can’t do that as well as you, sir.”

The ferry at the Bone Marsh had already docked at the Changchun Palace and was preparing to ascend once more.

The other party still hadn’t shown up.

Chen Pingan wasn’t anxious.

He continued practicing his punches.

As the intercontinental ferry was about to leave the territory of the Bottle Continent, Chen Pingan put away his stance, walked to the door, and there came a woman in a delicate palace outfit, along with a young emperor who wasn’t wearing a dragon robe, and a familiar figure to Chen Pingan, the wandering swordsman of the Mo family, Xu Ruo, with a sword slung behind her back.

Chen Pingan opened the door, not standing at the entrance to greet them, pretending he didn’t recognize any of them.

Returning to the room, Chen Pingan stood by the table without taking a seat first.

As the three entered the room, the woman walked directly to the opposite side of the table, smiling as she extended her hand, “Please sit, Young Master Chen.”

Chen Pingan smiled back.

The young man wore a wide smile but remained silent, slightly turning to gaze at his peer who had mixed in from Mud Bottle Alley to Desolate Mountain.

Xu Ruo chuckled softly, “Chen Pingan, long time no see.”

Only then did Chen Pingan return the greeting with a fist salute, “Xu Ruo, long time no see.”

Inside the small room, the atmosphere felt quite tense.

The woman covered her mouth and giggled, “What are we doing? Let’s all sit down. After all, we’re all family here—no need for formalities.”

However, once all four were seated, the atmosphere grew serious again.

Xu Ruo had already begun to meditate with her eyes closed.

The young emperor, who now held half of the Bottle Continent’s territory, Song He, was surveying the surroundings, taking in the intercontinental ferry. This was his first time aboard, and while he initially found it novel, it quickly became mundane.

The elegant woman, who had transitioned from the Empress to the Empress Dowager, smiled at the young man in the green shirt across from her, opening with a veiled remark, “My son Mu Er spent those years in Mud Bottle Alley, thanks to your kindness, Young Master Chen.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “It was nothing.”

From his expressions to his words, he was meticulous, showing neither disrespect nor any hint of reverence. 

Yet internally, Chen Pingan cursed, “Good for you.”

Xu Ruo’s lips curled slightly before she quickly wiped it away, a fleeting moment unnoticed by anyone.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 557: No Oddities in Northern Julu Continent**

As the esteemed Empress Dowager of the Great Li Empire, the woman seemed to finally remember her son, Song He, the new emperor. She smiled and said, "Young Master Chen, this is my son, Song He. I believe this is your first meeting, and I hope you can interact more often in the future. Young Master Chen is a prodigy carrying the martial fortunes of our Great Li, and since our nation is founded on martial prowess, both my uncle and Song He should, and will, show due respect to you."

The young emperor leaned slightly forward, smiling as he said, "I've met Mr. Chen." He showed no signs of arrogance befitting the emperor. This trip on the boat was a private visit in disguise, aimed at befriending so-called hermits of the mountains, so social niceties could be set aside for the moment.

Song He had earned a great reputation among the civil and military circles of the Great Li Empire in his early years. His popularity stemmed not only from the good upbringing by the Empress but also from his own commendable actions.

Chen Ping'an nodded and said, "I will definitely visit the capital if I have the chance."

The woman smiled and added, "The court plans to elevate Longquan from a county to a state, and Wu Yuan will be promoted to governor. I wonder if Young Master Chen has any suitable candidates in mind for the remaining county magistrate position?"

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, "Isn’t it a matter of choosing between County Magistrate Yuan and Supervisor Cao? County Magistrate Yuan is diligent and fair, governing his county so effectively that not a single piece of litter is found on the streets. Supervisor Cao is approachable and maintains a balance between strictness and leniency, ensuring that the Longyao matters are handled with utmost care. Both are good officials, and whichever of them gets promoted will surely please us common folks of Longquan."

The new emperor, Song He, glanced subtly at Chen Ping'an. Was he truly naive or merely pretending?

The two great families, Yuan and Cao, had long been rivals. If one side gained favor, it would inevitably leave the other feeling slighted. The position of a county magistrate was not particularly significant, but losing face for a prominent family was no small matter. Even if the heads of the Yuan and Cao families had no ulterior motives, their followers would certainly think otherwise. If one side thrived while the other choked, would the court not be pouring oil on the flames and inviting trouble?

The woman maintained her composure and smiled. "Perhaps Mr. Chen, as someone who cultivates in the mountains and enjoys traveling the world, has not had much contact with these local officials and thus has no personal connections to speak of. However, there is one matter you would likely have thoughts on: with Longquan being elevated to a state, the selection of the three city gods remains undecided. The mountain god of Luopo Mountain did not consult you beforehand when it chose the old supervisor, Song Yuzhang. Although it was in accordance with propriety, to be frank, it still lacked a bit of personal touch from our court. We should have discussed it with you first before making a decision. Therefore, for the selection of the three city gods, you need not have any reservations. My son, Song He, and I, along with the court, trust your character and judgment. Think of it as an invitation for you to help the Great Li choose one or two hidden gems."

The woman continued to persuade, "You are about to embark on another long journey, but Longquan is ultimately your hometown. Having one or two trustworthy individuals to look after Luopo Mountain would bring you peace of mind while you are away."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, expressing regret. "I am not very familiar with the local deities and city gods around Lihou Cave. My visits have always been hurried, otherwise, I would truly want to be selfish and ask the court for a city god who is close to me to oversee Longquan. I, Chen Ping'an, come from a humble background and have never studied formally. I am even less familiar with the ways of officials, but having wandered through the Jianghu for so long, I still understand the crude truth that 'the county magistrate is not as good as an actual manager.'"

Song He felt a smile rise in his heart. Though his words were true, Chen Ping'an only recognized a single deity, Wei Bo, of the North Peak, and they were practically on the same level.

The woman appeared equally regretful. "The selection of the three city gods has sparked intense debates within the Ministry of Rites, and a decision will be made soon. The Ministry of Works is already discussing the locations for the three city god temples. It is truly unfortunate that you may miss this opportunity. After all, once these deities take root, they will not be easily changed, unlike those transient officials who switch posts every few years."

Chen Ping'an sighed. "I appreciate the court's goodwill. The roads of Jianghu are long and the mountains and rivers high. I hope there will be similar opportunities in the future."

The woman stood gracefully, her simple action exuding elegance. "Then we shall not disturb Mr. Chen's journey and cultivation any longer."

Chen Ping'an stood as well. "I am neither a sword cultivator nor a wandering warrior now. I cannot see you off properly on this boat, so I hope for your understanding."

The woman nodded, indicating it was no trouble, and turned to Xu Ruo, smiling gently. "Since the boat has not yet left the borders of Baoping Continent, I presume our return journey with He'er will be quite safe. Mr. Xu, since you are acquainted with Mr. Chen, why not stay for a chat?"

Xu Ruo shook his head, smiling. "No need."

It was a concise reply, lacking even an explanation.

However, neither the woman nor the new emperor Song He seemed to find this offensive; it felt natural for Mr. Xu to express himself this way.

In the end, Chen Ping'an escorted the three to the boat railing. Nearby, the boat from the Pima Sect towered like a six-story building, making the already massive Pima boat seem a bit "slender." Between the two boats, a magnificent "corridor bridge" made of blue mist had been erected, over two yards wide, suffused with an ethereal aura. As they walked through, it felt as if they were treading on solid ground. Each time their feet touched the "blue stone path," colorful halos spread out in ripples.

Chen Ping'an remained still, looking up as an old cultivator in a white robe from the opposite boat retracted the celestial corridor bridge into his palm, small as a seal, before slowly hiding it in his sleeve.

The mother and son vanished down the boat's stairs.

Xu Ruo turned and leaned against the railing, while Chen Ping'an clasped his fists in farewell. The other party smiled and nodded in return.

As Chen Ping'an returned to his quarters, he stopped practicing his martial arts and closed his eyes, as if returning to the mountain gate of Qingxia Island at Shujian Lake, taking up the role of a steward.

He began to silently calculate accounts.

Some matters seemed trivial but were difficult to investigate. Any probing could disturb the grass and startle the snake, triggering a chain reaction. However, there were significant issues, even involving the deep-seated secrets of the Song family of Great Li, that Chen Ping'an could inquire about with complete ease from Cui Dongshan.

After careful consideration, it was still just a matter of waiting.

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes and gently tapped the sword-raising gourd with his fingers.

This mother and son duo had no need to take such a trip, and they were the ones to initiate goodwill.

Perhaps they were pursuing the greatest benefit; after the enmity of death years ago, the changing circumstances had rendered it negligible in the woman's eyes. 

To illustrate, if it cost ten taels of silver to kill Chen Ping'an, then to win him over would yield five taels of profit. This back-and-forth amounted to a fifteen-tael transaction.

Of course, it could also be a smokescreen. The woman was someone who used full strength even when hunting rabbits; otherwise, she wouldn't have deployed a group of assassins to kill Chen Ping'an, a mere second-tier warrior, back then.

It was equally possible that she was testing him, first confirming Chen Ping'an's depth and authenticity, and then having the Great Li court make a decision.

Chen Ping'an's thoughts drifted far away.

He pondered many things.

He couldn't help but recall a scene from his childhood that had filled him with envy, watching peers frolicking by the divine grave, enjoying playing both the hero and villain, starkly divided between right and wrong. Of course, they also played house, with rich boys acting as the husbands and pretty little girls as the wives, while the others played servants and maids, all doing so with great flair and exuberance. Many children brought items from home to dress the "wives" beautifully.

Looking back as an adult, the pure innocence of childhood seemed to fade; it appeared that even at a young age, children had already learned lessons that would last them a lifetime.

Chen Ping'an took down the sword-raising gourd, sipping his wine as he walked toward the observation deck.

The night was deep, and the boat had just passed the old North Peak of Great Li, its steepness resembling the empire's own style of conduct.

The bright moon hung high.

Chen Ping'an widened his eyes, gazing at the mountain and the moon.

The mountain appeared larger than the moon, creating the illusion that the mountain was grander. If someone had eyes as wide as the sky, they would see the mountain towering and the moon stretching even farther.

Inside a lavishly adorned room, draped in the most exquisite garments from the Nation of Colorful Garments, the woman poured herself a cup of tea. She suddenly furrowed her brows; the stool was a bit too high, causing her feet to dangle. Fortunately, her greatest ability in life was to adapt. She lifted her heels higher, lightly tapping the exquisite ground cloth crafted by a female cultivator of the Nation of Colorful Garments with her toes, and asked with a smile, "What do you think?"

Song He thought for a moment and replied, "It's quite dismissive."

The woman took a sip of tea, savoring it. It seemed to lack the spring tea of the Changchun Palace, a place that was, in all respects, not inviting, being as cold and desolate as a forgotten palace, filled with women who couldn't even gossip. The tea was the only enjoyable aspect, making those years of living in the mountains bearable. She deliberately sipped the tea, chewing on a tea leaf, believing that the essence of all flavors must be rooted in bitterness to be savored slowly. After swallowing the finely chewed tea leaves, she said slowly, "Without some capability and character, how could a wretched child raised in a humble alley live to today? What age is this? A mere twenty-one-year-old youth has built such a grand enterprise?"

Song He didn't really care about a character like the master of Luopo Mountain; he was merely dragged along by his mother.

Having become emperor, he was well aware of what blessings he should enjoy and what troubles he should shoulder. Since childhood, Song He had been clear about the countless formalities he had to deal with in a year since becoming emperor. Fortunately, he was adept, not at all appearing like a new ruler. It was no wonder that some old officials in the court found it hard to look at him, their eyes bulging as they searched for faults. They probably had to squint their old eyes, yet they couldn't find any flaws and were left with no choice but to accept.

Song He smiled and said, "If I had encountered what he did, I wouldn't have fared much worse than Chen Ping'an."

The woman asked, "Do you truly believe that?"

Song He nodded with a smile.

The woman narrowed her eyes, twisting the exquisite teacup, glazed in plum blue, with her fingers. "Think carefully and then answer me."

Song He quickly raised his hands, laughing, "Just a moment of youthful bravado, mother, please don't be upset."

However, the woman did not return to her usual doting demeanor. When alone with her son, she did not treat Song He as the emperor of Great Li. With a stern expression, she said, "Qi Jingchun would choose you?! Can you, Song He, endure hardship?!"

Song He shook his head. "Neither will I."

"In some places, you simply do not measure up to others; in this world, no one excels in everything and takes all the advantages!"

The woman angrily said, "Since you are destined to live a life of comfort, then think hard about how to enjoy it. This is a blessing many envy but cannot obtain! Never forget, this is never a simple matter! If you think that now you are the emperor of Great Li and dare to slack off in the slightest, I will tell you right now: if you ever lose your throne, and Song Mu takes it from you, I will still be the Empress Dowager of Great Li, and you will be nothing! Others may not know the truth or dare to speak of it, but your teacher Cui Zhan and your uncle Song Changjing will never forget! When it comes time to speak, can we mother and son stop them?"

Song He felt guilty. "It was the child's mistake; I shouldn't have become complacent."

In the past, the woman would have comforted him with kind words, but today was different. Her son's docility seemed to only irritate her further.

Slamming the teacup down heavily, tea splashed everywhere, and her expression turned frigid. "How was I teaching you back then? Living in the palace, it's hard to see the world outside, so I begged His Majesty to have the National Teacher personally teach you reading. Not only that, but whenever I had the chance, I took you to sneak out of the palace and walk through the capital, to let you see how the poor rise and how the rich fall, how fools survive and how wise men meet their demise! Everyone has their own way to live and their strengths and weaknesses, all to make you understand the complexities and truths of this world!”

"Do you remember the first time I hit you? In the market, ignorant commoners jokingly said that the emperor's old son must be using a golden carrying pole, eating several large plates of steamed buns in one meal. You laughed at that, finding it amusing. Was it funny?! Do you know that the way that embroidered tiger looked at you was the same way you looked at those commoners?!"

"A dragon throne and a dragon robe cannot fill your belly! If the day comes when you are truly at your wit's end, will a few steamed buns be enough? What did the National Teacher teach you? In this world, those who achieve great things must have their solid roots hidden in the dark. The more aligned they are with worldly affairs and common sense, the more they will remain unshaken by storms! Who was the example the National Teacher used? It was that seemingly drowsy old man of the Guan family! Who was the counter-example? It was those legendary families of Yuan and Cao! Such clear teachings about 'how bad people can live well,' and you, Song He, dare not pay attention?!"

The woman stood up, her anger boiling over. "Those few books that the world's emperors keep secret, the so-called emperor's teacher’s texts, and the hidden techniques of the rulers are worth nothing! Are those great principles not good? They are perfect, beyond reproach! But do you understand why, in this Baoping Continent, so many emperors and rulers remain, yet so few? How many have become wise rulers? It is because those who sit on the dragon throne lack the vision and character, the ability to govern, to support the principles in those books! The embroidered tiger once taught his skills; which of his words, which of those profound truths did not start from the most insignificant detail?"

The woman's face turned ashen as she pointed at the young emperor of Great Li. "You compare your hardship to that of a wretched child, thinking yourself superior. Tomorrow, will you compare your merits with your brother, believing yourself greater? Competing knowledge with the National Teacher, competing martial prowess with your uncle, thinking you're not inferior? Who gave you the audacity to be so arrogant, you Song He?! Me, who has lived my life with my tail tucked between my legs? The late emperor, who was harmed by the Lu family and died young? Or your National Teacher, who looks down on you, his disciple?!"

Song He stood up as well, remaining silent.

There was no anger or resentment, only humility and willingness to learn.

Even though he was now the man sitting on the dragon throne.

The woman sighed, slumping back into her chair, gazing at her son who was unwilling to take a seat. Her eyes held a hint of sorrow. "He'er, do you find mother bothersome?"

Only then did Song He sit down, smiling softly. "If it weren't for the concerns of court and public opinion, I'd want mother to take the curtain and listen to politics, so you could leave your mark in history."

The woman chuckled. "Nonsense!"

Song He, Song Mu, harmonious and peaceful, a family united brings prosperity.

The disparity between a humble merchant household and an imperial family is vast, but the underlying principles remain the same.

However, back then, the woman had to make a difficult choice, sacrificing one for the other, sending away a son still in swaddling clothes to ensure the Song family's heritage. After the "untimely death," the name that should have been Song He was crossed out in the genealogical records of the clan, while the second son not only remained in the capital but also received the name Song He and the status of the eldest son.

This led later to the emergence of Song Jixin from the Mud Bottle Alley, Song Yuzhang's departure from the capital, and his role as the kiln supervisor. After achieving success, he returned to the capital to report to the Ministry of Rites, only to be met with misfortune at the hands of that Lu family general beside the woman, who personally severed his head and delivered it to the late emperor. The late emperor spent a night alone in the imperial study, reviewing a document until dawn, and later issued a decree to appoint Song Yuzhang as the new mountain god of Luopo Mountain, with only his head gilded in the temple's statue, thus the people of Longquan referred to him as the "Golden-headed Mountain God."

The Ministry of Rites, responsible for compiling the genealogies and managing the Song family's records, lost several elders over twenty years ago, and just last year and this year, lost another batch, all of them "dying of old age." However, back then, it was the late emperor's order that forced them to die; this time, however, it was these old bones that sought death themselves, betting on a baseless imperial prince to overturn the situation and argue for a "seniority" status.

Song He took his leave.

The woman drank tea alone.

Her emotions were complex.

Whether it was Song Jixin or "Song Mu," both were her flesh and blood, how could there be no feelings?

Years ago, she had held her firstborn in her arms, gazing at her adorable son with tears streaming down her face, murmuring, "Who let you be the elder brother? Who let you be born into the Song family of Great Li? Who let you be burdened with us, your heartless parents?"

The late emperor had been present, yet he showed no sign of anger.

Throughout the years, she had been deeply saddened after that occasion when she risked everything to sneak a peek at the secret files, only to be reprimanded by the late emperor, and she had given up completely on her lost son. She had come to regard that child as dead.

In her heart, the more guilt she felt, the more she feared facing Song Jixin, afraid to hear anything about him. 

She feared that one day, it would implicate her "only son" raised beside her, leading to nothing but a futile effort.

That Song Yuzhang, who had served as the kiln supervisor for many years, had originally had the chance to avoid death, or at least to die later and more gloriously. According to the late emperor's original arrangement, Song Yuzhang would have first transitioned to the Ministry of Rites for a few years, and then transferred to the powerless Qingshui Office, certainly at a high rank. Among the Nine Ministers, he would not have to worry about being denied by the late emperor, but would surely secure a minor position, such as the Minister of Rites or a subordinate position in the Ministry of Rites, enjoying a comfortable life for a decade or two, ultimately receiving a commendable posthumous title—considered a generous treatment by the Song family of Great Li.

It was worth noting that the bridge project overseen by Song Yuzhang concealed the greatest scandal of the Song family, which could have devastating consequences if exposed, especially under the scrutiny of the Observing Lake Academy, potentially impacting Great Li's plans to annex the Baoping Continent.

Thus, the late emperor had been sufficiently merciful towards Song Yuzhang.

But it was a thousand mistakes not to have the rumors circulating in Luopo Cave about Song Jixin being the illegitimate son of the supervisor already common knowledge. Despite the widespread knowledge, Song Yuzhang still failed to restrain himself, showing signs of fatherly affection toward Song Jixin. The most damning thing was that deep down, Song Jixin, despite his resentment, truly hoped that Song Yuzhang was his biological father. The secret records contained clear evidence, and after Song Yuzhang returned to Longquan as an official of the Ministry of Rites, he showed no signs of repentance. What could he do if he didn’t die? Even after Song Yuzhang's death, the late emperor still planned to punish this loyal minister for his transgressions, allowing her to sever his head and deliver it back to the capital, where he was bestowed the title of mountain god of Luopo Mountain, a gilded head, becoming the subject of ridicule across the entire New North Peak region.

Even after the late emperor had departed.

The woman still held a sense of fear towards this talented yet prematurely deceased man.

She loved him and held him in great admiration.

Yet he died at the perfect time, and she was actually quite relieved.

Some women view love as a seasoning for cooking; having it is best, but if not, it’s no matter; there are always other things to compensate for that.

The old cultivator in white who had earlier folded the celestial corridor bridge into his sleeve stroked his beard and chuckled. "It seems our Empress has begun her lessons again."

Xu Ruo smiled but remained silent.

The Great Li boat turned southward, while the Pima boat continued northward.

The old man turned his gaze to the north, speaking softly, "Why choose Dong Shuijing and not this individual?"

Xu Ruo smiled. "Kindness does not govern troops, nor does righteousness govern wealth."

The old man chuckled dismissively, showing no reservations about his disapproval.

Xu Ruo pressed her palms against the sword hilts behind her, relaxed in demeanor, gazing into the vast expanse of land and mountains ahead.

Below the boat, in the northern region of Baoping Continent, the river flowed wide like a broom, spreading far and wide.

The old man was the spokesperson of the Mo family, having placed their bets on Great Li, and was well-acquainted with Xu Ruo and the old carpenter.

He had maintained a good relationship with them, but after the latter had lost in the struggle for the title of Mo family patriarch and moved away from the Central Plains, he ultimately chose the Song family of Great Li.

Alongside them were the side branches of the Yin-Yang family, the Lu family, and the two sides formed an unlikely alliance, embarking on the audacious project of privately constructing a replica of the white jade capital capable of subduing celestial realm cultivators.

Moreover, the great Yin-Yang cultivator had even more subtle schemes, enticing the late emperor of Great Li to defy Confucian rites and secretly practice to reach the Middle Five Realms. Once the emperor broke through, he would retain his consciousness while secretly becoming a puppet, losing all his cultivational realms, essentially returning to the status of an ordinary scholar. At that moment, whether it was the Observing Lake Academy in the capital or the distant Observing Lake Academy in the central Baoping Continent, even if they sensed something amiss, there would be no clues to follow. Such grand plans could only be conceived and executed by the deeply rooted Lu family of the Yin-Yang faction.

Regarding this matter, even the old carpenter, the one surnamed Luan, had been thoroughly deceived. Despite their daily interactions, they remained entirely unaware. It must be said that the meticulousness of the Lu family's side branch cultivator was impressive, as was the late emperor's cunning.

The National Teacher Cui Zhan and Qi Jingchun's Observing Lake Academy had only chosen the Song family of Great Li after these two factions. As for the mutual enmity between Cui Zhan and Qi Jingchun, who were now neighbors, their true ambitions were not easy to discern.

Then came the arrival of that A Liang.

It completely changed the landscape of Great Li and the Baoping Continent.

After A Liang's sword strike, the replica of the white jade capital, forged with half the nation's strength, became inoperative. For decades, it would no longer be able to employ the sword formation to kill from miles away, and Great Li suffered devastating losses, its vitality severely wounded. However, misfortune turned to fortune, as the late arrival of the head of Luopo Cave, Lu Chen, seemed to lose interest in Great Li, never once attacking it since arriving in the realm of Haoran, nor when returning to the realm of Qingming. He did not destroy the white jade capital of Great Li, a leniency that remains a mystery to many high-level cultivators. Had Lu Chen intervened, even if it was out of anger towards Great Li, some extreme actions would likely not be obstructed by the deputy head of the Confucian Temple and the accompanying sacred figures.

Afterward, the Great Li cavalry accelerated southward.

The construction of the replica of the white jade capital consumed half the resources of the Song family of Great Li.

Additionally, Great Li had continuously received celestial money through a secret channel and through credit, allowing the Luan patriarch and the Mo family’s craftsmen to construct a total of eight "mountain" boats.

One could say that as long as the southward momentum of Great Li was hindered and delayed in some place for three to five more years, even if the strength of the Great Li cavalry remained largely intact, the Song family of Great Li itself would not be able to sustain it.

Therefore, the Zhu Ying Dynasty's desperate attempts to stop the Great Li cavalry were not mere acts of passion; the surrounding vassal states’ fierce resistance, often deploying tens of thousands of troops to wear down the Great Li cavalry, was undoubtedly guided by high-level strategists behind the scenes. Otherwise, in the face of such overwhelming odds, who would willingly march to their deaths?

This old Mo cultivator had previously held a rather poor opinion of Cui Zhan, believing that his famed reputation was undeserved, too empty and lacking substance, even questioning the significance of his colorful connections with the lord of Baidi City. What was the use of being a disciple of the Sage of Letters and reaching the twelfth realm of cultivation if he was alone without backing or a mountain of his own? Moreover, in the Central Plains, Cui Zhan was still not among the very top echelon.

After being expelled from the 文脉 of the Sage of Letters, rolling up his bedding to return to his homeland, Baoping Continent, what great achievements could he accomplish?

But when Xu Ruo convinced the current patriarch of the Mo family, they finally arrived in this remote and barbaric land of the Baoping Continent, gradually recognizing Cui Zhan's prowess.

Last year, when the Great Li cavalry was blocked at the borders by the Zhu Ying Dynasty, in an attempt to calm the populace, Cui Zhan, who had rarely shown himself, finally gathered some old men and sat down for an honest chat. They did not discuss the inevitable success of Great Li or how to divide the spoils afterward; instead, Cui Zhan focused on the next ten years of each step the Great Li cavalry would take, detailing which of the three cavalry divisions would clash with whom, where battles would occur, the respective casualties, and how it correlated with the national treasury of Great Li, covering the minutiae in excruciating detail. Then, he spoke about the various mountain forces of the Baoping Continent, the subtle shifts in their attitudes during different stages, and when the Qi Zhen faction would step in, ultimately willing to meet with the Great Li envoy. Afterward, Cui Zhan elaborated on the potential resurgence of the Great Li's new territorial layout and the back-and-forth of the stationed troops, what would ignite the fuse, and how it should conclude, discussing the gains and losses of Great Li in this period.

At the end, Cui Zhan left everyone with bated breath, whether to believe or not, to withdraw halfway or double down. There was no rush; they could simply watch from across the river to see if the Great Li cavalry would subdue the Zhu Ying Dynasty according to Cui Zhan's outlined steps.

As it turned out, Cui Zhan was right.

Until that moment, the old cultivator had no choice but to admit that Cui Zhan indeed excelled at strategizing.

However, the old cultivator was also rather stubborn; not believing in the supernatural, he went to ask Cui Zhan how he achieved all this. He simply could not accept that there was someone capable of anticipating the enemy's moves or predicting outcomes. After all, a continent at war was not merely a game of chess where a player could move a few pieces.

Cui Zhan took him to a heavily guarded archive of Great Li, secretly built on the outskirts of the capital.

Nearly five hundred people were present, half of whom were cultivators, all engaged in a single task: gathering intelligence, extracting information, and coordinating with spies and assassins from across the continent.

The military deployments of all the dynasties and vassal states on Baoping Continent, the distribution of mountain forces, and the personal backgrounds of civil and military officials were meticulously categorized, with a mountain's interior entirely excavated to house these accumulated records spanning a century.

What truly shocked the old cultivator was not merely the scale of this operation but a seemingly minor detail that was easily overlooked.

As the Confucian-clad National Teacher of Great Li led him through the vast "Book Mountain," everyone they encountered moved hurriedly, merely stepping aside for the National Teacher, exchanging only brief words without any formality or pleasantries, even when he inquired. The exchanges were concise, and they parted ways.

As a distinguished cultivator of the Mo family and a master of mechanized arts, the old cultivator at that moment felt as if he was within a grand and intricate mechanism, filled with precision and fit. 

The historical event of cultivators descending from the mountain to "support the dragon" paled in comparison to the actions of this embroidered tiger, resembling mere child's play.

The infamous first disciple of the Sage of Letters had remained silent for a full century after leaving the Central Plains.

Ironically, as the eight "mountain" boats slowly took to the skies and the Great Li cavalry formally set out southward, nearly no one cared what Cui Zhan was doing in the Baoping Continent.

Throughout the journey, Chen Ping'an had been learning the elegant language of Northern Julu Continent.

In this regard, Northern Julu was far better than Baoping and Tongye, as the elegant language was universally spoken across the continent. While there were official languages and local dialects, they were nowhere near as complex as in the other two continents. Moreover, when venturing out, it was customary to communicate in elegant language, sparing Chen Ping'an a lot of trouble. He had suffered in the past on the Upside-Down Mountain, where the elegant language of Baoping was incomprehensible to cultivators from other continents, leading to disdain.

As the Pima boat was about to dock, Chen Ping'an organized his belongings and approached the railing on the first floor. The strongmen dragging the boats, flying through the air, were astonishing, appearing to be neither purely spectral entities nor mere puppets, but something between the two.

Below was the vast expanse of the Bone Marsh, not at all the eerie atmosphere Chen Ping'an had imagined. Instead, there were several spots of brilliant colors reaching toward the clouds, lingering like auspicious signs.

The Bone Marsh spanned a thousand miles, mostly comprising flat plains with few towering peaks typical of conventional sects. The only significant river ran straight down the center, unlike the meandering rivers of the ordinary, almost like a sword cleaved straight down, with virtually no tributaries branching off, which likely concealed some profound mystery.

The Pima boat housed only one celestial shop, filled with a plethora of goods. The shop's treasure included two highly-ranked relics, remnants of ancient celestial swords. Had they not suffered extensive damage, rendering their restoration impossible, they would undoubtedly have been considered semi-celestial weapons. Their most noteworthy aspect was that they were referred to as "companions" of the mountain, one named "Rainfall" and the other "Lamp Glow," believed to be the swords of a pair of sword immortals from Northern Julu.

Thus, the boats were not sold separately, and the two swords were priced at one hundred Gu Yu coins.

There was also an enticing offer: if purchased by a celestial sword cultivator, a discount of twenty percent would apply. For those in the higher realms, the discount would be thirty percent.

However, relative to celestial cultivators, the price was indeed a bit steep, especially for a higher realm sword cultivator, rendering it somewhat impractical.

Chen Ping'an merely took a glance, knowing he was financially strapped. Moreover, even if he had the money, he wouldn't want to be taken advantage of.

Nonetheless, he did buy a few clever, inexpensive trinkets from the shop bearing the "Xuhen" sign. One was a spiritual artifact connecting the Reflection Mountain's mirror to the moonlit water, a green porcelain ink wash basin, similar to the water bowl belonging to Chen Lingjun in his days. This basin was mentioned in the ancient text on the Upside-Down Mountain, specifically noted as a place for sword cultivators to duel. Any grudges could be settled there without the need for a life-and-death contract; once agreed upon, they would simply fight until one was dead. For a millennium, there had been nearly no exceptions.

Additionally, he acquired a vintage ink stone and a box of specially crafted ink made from the last emperor of a fallen dynasty, totaling ten pieces.

When Chen Ping'an settled the bill, the shopkeeper personally appeared, smiling as he mentioned that the Great God Wei of the Piyun Mountain had already given word that all expenses at "Xuhen" would be charged to Piyun Mountain's account.

Chen Ping'an did not hesitate and asked, "What if I wish to buy more items?"

The shopkeeper chuckled and shook his head, saying that after he made an appearance, the agreement would be voided.

Chen Ping'an smiled and thanked the shopkeeper. After some light conversation, he learned that while the shop was located on the Pima boat, the shopkeeper was not a member of the Pima Sect. The Pima Sect was extremely selective in choosing disciples. The names on the sect's genealogy were all highly esteemed, and after the founding ancestor migrated from the Central Plains, they established a quota of "thirty-six inner disciples and one hundred and eight outer disciples." Thus, the Bone Marsh was mostly populated by outsiders like him.

The old shopkeeper was quite talkative, introducing Chen Ping'an to the customs and taboos of the Bone Marsh.

As they chatted at the railing, Chen Ping'an turned to see two streaks of sword light intersecting against the sky. Each clash released a burst of brilliance and lightning.

The old shopkeeper seemed unperturbed, saying, "This happens often. Our sword cultivators here are merely stretching their muscles. You can see they are keeping their distance from the center of the Bone Marsh; otherwise, if both sides truly fought with all their might, it wouldn’t matter if it were here in the Bone Marsh or even flying above the ancestral hall, it would be unsurprising. At worst, they'd simply send the Pima cultivators flying, bleeding three buckets or so, which is nothing. If their abilities were sufficient, a free-for-all would be much more enjoyable."

Chen Ping'an was left speechless.

This Northern Julu Continent truly was a... remarkable place.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 558: A Reunion of Old Friends**

The Bone Marsh Ferry is a bustling hub located in the southern part of Northern Culu Continent, thriving with commerce and a constant flow of people. To Chen Ping'an, it feels like a place where immortal wealth walks on legs, sparking some hopeful fantasies about the future of his own Bullhorn Mountain Ferry.

As the ferry slowly docked, impatient passengers surged forward, unable to wait even a moment. True to the rules, boarding and disembarking here should be done on foot, regardless of one's cultivation level or status—this was the standard across places like Baoping Continent, Tongye Continent, and the chaotic Hanging Mountain. However, here it was a different story. Even those who meant to follow the rules hurriedly pushed ahead, while many others gracefully soared away on their swords, or rode their magical mounts, leaping off the ferry in a chaotic mix of excitement. 

The ferry manager from the Pi Ma Sect and the dock workers watched these unruly passengers with annoyance, exchanging curses. One cultivator from the Watching Sea realm, unable to contain his anger, directly struck down a Qi Practitioner who had flown over him.

Chen Ping'an couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. This was happening right under the Pi Ma Sect's nose—imagine what chaos would ensue elsewhere!

He wasn't in a rush to disembark, though; the old manager was still recommending several must-visit spots around the Bone Marsh, sharing his insights about the local scenery. Chen Ping'an appreciated the man's kindness and felt it would be rude to interrupt him. He had learned from a young age that when someone speaks earnestly, it is a sign of respect to listen attentively, so he only stole a few glances at the disembarking scene before turning his focus back to the old man.

Having spent two to three hundred years running a ferry business, the old manager had developed a keen eye for spotting details. He quickly wrapped up his previous topic and smiled, saying, “You see, our Northern Culu Continent may seem chaotic, but once you get used to it, it feels refreshing. It's true that conflicts can arise unexpectedly, yet there are also countless moments where chance encounters lead to deep trust—people who would stake their lives for each other. I believe, young Master Chen, you will come to understand this in time.”

At this point, pride was evident on the old man's weathered face, a face that had seen much. 

Chen Ping'an felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering how there were those who once took pride in being born in Northern Culu, even if they were merely Qi Practitioners serving on the ferry to Jiao Mountain.

The old manager hesitated for a moment, recalling his private meeting with Wei Bo, the god of the North Mountain of Da Li, and softly said, “Young Master Chen, may I say something that might not be well-received?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Please, go ahead, Manager Huang.”

The old manager continued slowly, “Northern Culu is rather insular, prone to internal strife. However, when united against outsiders, especially in a group, there are certain types of outsiders they despise most. One type is the Confucian scholars who come here from afar, viewed with disdain for their pretentiousness. The second type is the spoiled offspring of prominent families from other continents, who often carry an air of superiority. Lastly, there are the foreign sword cultivators, who are seen as reckless, daring to sharpen their swords in Northern Culu.” 

He sighed, leaning on the railing, “Of these three types, the second is the most reviled. Historically, many young people who were once powerful back in their home continents found themselves humiliated here, having been unable to hold their ground. Many left in disgrace, while some even lost their lives. Among them were Huang Ziguo of the Dragon Tiger Mountain's Celestial Master Mansion, direct disciples of various schools, and the younger brother of a certain God of Wealth from the White Snow Continent, who was killed outright here. There are countless such stories. Many of those who lost family or disciples here never even figured out who their enemies were.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “I will keep Manager Huang's warning in mind.”

The old manager regained his smile and clasped his fists, declaring, “A few taboos may bind the truly capable like mere ropes, but Northern Culu never turns away true heroes. So here’s to wishing Young Master Chen success in carving out your own path in Northern Culu!”

Chen Ping'an returned the gesture. “Then I shall borrow Manager Huang's good wishes!”

He donned his conical hat, slung his sword over his back, and stepped off the Pi Ma Sect's ferry.

According to the old manager, there were three places in the Bone Marsh that one must visit; otherwise, a trip there would be in vain.

The first was the grand but low-ranking Yao Wei Temple, dedicated to the River God. Although its rank was low, it was much more splendid than most water god temples of the vast rivers across Northern Culu. 

Next was the enormous city known as Mural City, which extended from the foot of the Pi Ma Sect's mountain deep into the earth. It had eight towering walls decorated with lifelike murals of eight ancient celestial maidens, vividly painted. It was said that a great fortune awaited those destined to see them, as these maidens were remnants of the spirits of palace officials from an ancient heavenly court. If someone caught their eye while admiring the murals, they would emerge to serve that person for life, with varying levels of cultivation. Currently, three of the eight maidens remained, while five had lost their spiritual energy. The highest still possessed the cultivation of a Jade Purity realm practitioner, while the lowest was a Golden Core Earth Immortal. There were also treasures depicted in the murals that would be taken along by the maidens when they emerged. The Pi Ma Sect had invited many experts in the past to attempt to acquire these treasures using methods from the celestial realm, but the mysteries of the murals were profound, and they had never succeeded.

Besides the remaining three murals, the city was also filled with vendors selling coveted items and spirit puppets, desired by ghost cultivators. Even ordinary celestial mansions would come here to place bids on well-trained spirit puppets, which could serve as alternative guardians or powerful defensive weapons in the martial world. Moreover, Mural City was a gathering place for loose cultivators, often hiding significant treasures. A young sword cultivator who had recently gone to the Sword Qi Great Wall had even picked up a semi-immortal weapon from one of these wild cultivators.

Lastly, there was the “Ghost Valley,” the most alluring spot for sword cultivators and pure martial artists in the Bone Marsh. The Pi Ma Sect aimed to gather and expel the difficult-to-subdue evil spirits into this area, where outsiders would pay a toll to enter at their own risk.

Chen Ping'an decided to head first to the nearest Mural City.

After Chen Ping'an distanced himself from the ferry, an old Pi Ma Sect cultivator responsible for the intercontinental ferries, whose aura was restrained and whose spiritual energy barely leaked, appeared next to Manager Huang. This famed Nascent Soul cultivator had a high status in the Pi Ma Sect’s founding hall but rarely showed himself, especially disliking social obligations. Now, he smiled at the old manager, “You’re still in business, yet that was hardly an unpleasing remark; it was downright unpleasant.”

A young man who was able to attract the attention of Wei Bo, the North Mountain god of Da Li, and monopolized three mountain peaks of the Li Pearl Cave, would surely have connections to the types of people the shopkeeper described. At the very least, he was likely one of them. The old cultivator, who was typically aloof, might misinterpret the manager's intentions as a warning.

The old manager stroked his beard and laughed, “If he were a prideful and impatient young man, he wouldn’t have stayed so low-profile on the ferry. After hearing about the three places in Mural City, he would have already jumped off, not willing to waste time with an old man like me. Therefore, I believe my words were necessary.”

The old Nascent Soul chuckled casually, “Knowing a person’s face does not mean knowing their heart.”

The old manager laughed heartily, “It’s just business. If I can build up some good will, that’s a profit. That’s why, old Su, you are simply not cut out for business. The Pi Ma Sect handing this ferry over to you is like wasting a gold mine. How many connections could you have made with all those people passing by? You just let them slip through your fingers.”

“Is it really a good thing for a cultivator to be well-connected and opportunistic?” 

The old Nascent Soul sneered, “If someone with potential for the Jade Purity realm were to come here and waste their time, wouldn’t that be an even greater waste?”

Feigning ignorance of the underlying meaning, the old manager leaned on the railing, gazing at the familiar scenery. The ferry business rarely lacked scenic views, but after seeing so many, he still felt that his own land was the best. Listening to the words of a Nascent Soul master, he smiled and said, “Don’t think of me as a fool; I won’t take any complaints here.”

The old Nascent Soul dismissed the comment, then recalled something and frowned, asking, “What’s going on with the Yu Gui Sect? Why did they move their lower sect to Baoping Continent? According to reason, after Du Mao of Tongye Sect died, they should have managed to hold things together. As long as Xun Yuan gently nudged the lower sect northward, taking advantage of the situation, Tongye Sect would likely be finished in less than three hundred years. Why didn’t he take such an easy opportunity? The potential of the lower sect being established in Baoping Continent might be great, but can it truly compare to completely taking over the Tongye Sect? I heard that Xun Yuan was quite the flirt in his youth; could it be that he lost his mind to a woman's charms?”

The manager of Xu Hentang shook his head, “Anyone can be foolish in the Yu Gui Sect, but Xun Yuan is not one of them. Even if I’ve never interacted with him, just the fact that he managed to tame Jiang Shangzhen proves he’s no simple character. What kind of temper does Jiang Shangzhen have? He was merely at the Golden Core level, yet he traveled through Northern Culu alone, causing chaos among many mountains and celestial maidens. In the end, he cleaned up and successfully escaped. I hold no grudges in my life, except for my little master’s untimely death, which I’ve never been able to come to terms with! My little master once protected and guided me, and without her care, I would have been six feet under long ago. That scoundrel Jiang Shangzhen, how could he treat my little master, such a wonderful woman, so poorly? Damn it, just mentioning that guy makes me furious but also grudgingly respectful.”

The old manager, usually quite refined in speech, showed a hint of bitterness when bringing up Jiang Shangzhen.

The old Nascent Soul chuckled at his misfortune, “My friend, your basket is full.”

The old manager spat, seemingly trying to expel his frustration with it. 

He then curiously asked, “From the looks of it, the Da Li Song family seems intent on elevating the Bullhorn Mountain Ferry, showing no interest in expanding the Changchun Palace Ferry. Who will you need to deal with then? A Da Li military general or a serving cultivator?”

The old Nascent Soul shook his head, “Da Li is most wary of outsiders snooping for intel. Our founding hall has issued strict instructions; many well-known methods are prohibited in the North Mountain territory to avoid enmity. Da Li today is not what it once was; they have the confidence to block the Bone Marsh ferries from heading south. As of now, I’m not sure who they’ll send, but it doesn’t matter. I’m not interested in stirring trouble; as long as things are amicable, that’s enough.”

The old Nascent Soul sighed, “Just a few years ago, after the first intercontinental ferry in Da Li began operating, the stationed cultivators and generals were all top-notch figures. They all smiled at us, bowing and scraping, never standing tall. You’ve seen it yourself; and now, how about that North Mountain god, Wei Bo? Is he still bending over backward? No, right? The tides have turned, and soon it will be us who need to seek favors!”

The old Nascent Soul suddenly tensed, giving the manager a knowing look. The latter appeared alarmed, but the old cultivator shook his head, signaling him not to panic.

As long as they were in the Bone Marsh territory, there wouldn’t be chaos. Was the protective formation of the Pi Ma Sect merely for show?

The two of them turned to look as a “guest” boarding the ferry against the current caught their attention. He was a middle-aged man wearing a purple gold crown and a white jade belt, exuding an elegant aura. As he walked, he surveyed his surroundings, seemingly regretful. Eventually, he stopped not far behind the two old men, smiling at the old manager and asking, “What’s your little master’s name? Perhaps I know her.”

The old manager could discuss many things, but when it came to personal matters, especially regarding his little master, he fell silent, his expression darkening. “Who do you think you are? Where did you crawl out from? Just go back where you came from!”

The man spoke fluently in the refined dialect of Northern Culu, nodding, “I am Zhou Fei from the Chun Chao Palace.”

The old manager sneered, “If you’re not Jiang Shangzhen, then get lost!”

The middle-aged cultivator pondered for a moment, then replied with a smile, “Very well, I’ll just take my leave.” 

And he did indeed turn and walked straight off the ferry.

The old manager turned to the tense old Nascent Soul, puzzled. “Could he be a powerful Nascent Soul like you?”

The old Nascent Soul raised a finger, indicating upwards.

The old manager remained unperturbed, at least not panicking, stroking his chin. “Should I hide in your founding hall for a month? If it comes to a fight, how much would I owe for the damages to the Pi Ma Sect’s founding hall? I’d be sure to pay, but in light of our old friendship, how about an eight percent discount?”

The old Nascent Soul patted his shoulder, “That one does not look like a good person; you should just be careful. If he hadn’t walked off, you might want to go apologize to him. As a businessman, since you dare to say I’m not cut out for this, why worry about saving face?”

The old manager spat, “If that guy really had any skills, he should do it right in front of Old Su!”

The old Nascent Soul, who claimed to be uninterested in meddling, suddenly radiated treasure light, then brought his fingers together as if trying to grasp something.

But he was still a moment too late.

A vibrant green willow leaf hung in the air, hovering at the old manager's heart. 

A voice rang out near the ferry railing, “You’ve already used up that bit of incense fortune; if you keep babbling, you’ll truly be left out in the cold.”

The willow leaf vanished in a flash.

After a moment, the old Nascent Soul said, “He’s gone far.”

The old manager's expression was complex, remaining silent for a long time before asking, “If I spread this news around, how much immortal money could I earn?”

The old Nascent Soul smiled, “I advise against being impulsive; you can earn a life but can’t spend it.”

The old manager gritted his teeth, slamming his palm against the railing, wishing he could shout, that damned Jiang Shangzhen was back in Northern Culu to wreak havoc on his little wife.

At the entrance of Mural City, located at the foot of the Pi Ma Sect, throngs of people filled the area. Chen Ping'an walked for half a stick of incense before finally finding a relatively quiet spot to take off his conical hat and enjoy a simple lunch at a roadside stall. Just as he was about to get up to settle the bill, he noticed a familiar figure had appeared, already paying for his meal.

Chen Ping'an picked up his hat and asked, “Did you come just to wait for me?”

The man laughed, “Some matters need me to come personally to clarify, lest misunderstandings arise and ruin our friendship.”

Chen Ping'an was momentarily taken aback. This man had never been so familiar or diligent in his previous encounters in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land or the Qing Hu Palace of Tongye Continent.

Jiang Shangzhen laughed heartily, “Apologies, apologies. I stayed in Northern Culu for a while in the past, and now that I’m back, I can’t help but get carried away and call everyone ‘brother’ and ‘sister.’”

The two walked together towards the entrance of Mural City, Jiang Shangzhen speaking lightly with Chen Ping'an. 

Just as they reached the entrance, Jiang Shangzhen finished speaking and took his leave, mentioning that he needed to return to the Shujian Lake, where many tasks awaited him.

After parting with Chen Ping'an, Jiang Shangzhen returned to the Pi Ma Sect ferry, where he had a good “heart-to-heart” with the old manager, using emotional persuasion and rational arguments to ensure there would be no lingering issues. Only after confirming everything was cleared did Jiang Shangzhen board his own magical ferry, returning to Baoping Continent.

Chen Ping'an walked down a nearly invisible ten-mile slope, entering the underground Mural City. Lanterns crafted by celestial beings lit the sides of the road, illuminating the surroundings as bright as day, the soft and natural light reminiscent of warm sunlight in winter.

Chen Ping'an quietly pondered Jiang Shangzhen’s words.

He sidestepped a hurried woman clutching a porcelain bottle, almost completely unfazed as he continued forward.

He hadn’t anticipated that the woman would suddenly fall, crying loudly, surrounded by shattered porcelain pieces.

Chen Ping'an leaned back slightly before swiftly retracing his steps, reaching the woman’s side. With a loud slap, he caught her off guard, followed by another that stung sharply. 

The woman, who should have clung to the man’s leg and started her usual dramatic display, suddenly held back her cries, timidly glancing at her four or five companions by the roadside. Feeling that she couldn’t let two slaps go unanswered, they all rushed forward, demanding compensation for the “three small summer coins” worth porcelain vase she had claimed was valuable, which had cost her two taels of silver.

Unfortunately for her, she ended up receiving another kick from a young man, causing her head to spin, leaving her with a parting remark, demanding she pay for the three taels of silver.

The woman lamented, “Wasn’t it just two taels for the original price?”

But her words only earned her another kick to the face. The man laughed sinisterly, “Isn’t the fare for my brothers not even worth a tael of silver?”

As the group of men departed, they whispered among themselves, one of them recalling that the young man in the conical hat had been an easy target earlier.

On the road, the woman paid no mind to the blood at the corner of her mouth. After all, with so many people around, if she disturbed a real immortal lord, it wouldn’t be a small matter. She hurriedly took out a large cloth from her sleeve to gather the broken porcelain shards, fleeing the scene.

Exiting the sloping entrance of Mural City, Chen Ping'an entered an alley adorned with faded door gods, couplets, and a large character for “Spring” at the top.

Rubbing his cheek and tidying his clothes, he forced a smile before pushing the door open. Inside, two children were playing in the courtyard.

The woman closed the courtyard door and went to the kitchen to start a fire for cooking. Looking at the nearly empty rice jar, she sighed softly.

After preparing a humble meal, suddenly, one child dashed in, followed closely by a younger sibling, both hands holding two snow-white coins. The child’s eyes sparkled as they asked, “Mother, mother, there are two coins at the door! Do you think they fell from the mouth of the door god?”

The woman was stunned. 

Where did the two snow-white coins come from? Wealthy people wouldn’t bother to tease her family of three, and she had no charm to attract attention, let alone her two ordinary children. What was going on?

A young man wearing a conical hat stepped out of the alley, muttering to himself, “Just this once; after this, there’s no need to know other people’s stories.”

He walked slowly, turning to see the two little children using all their might to run, laughing and shouting about buying candied hawthorns, excitedly asking for treats.

The young swordsman in his blue robe couldn’t help but smile, adjusting his conical hat. After years of his eyes being filled with a deep, quiet melancholy, it was rare to feel warmth like this. “Then maybe I’ll know just once more?”

For reasons unknown, determined to indulge in one more instance of “troubling oneself,” the young swordsman suddenly felt his heart lighten. He sensed that the world was vast and that he was free to go anywhere.

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 559: Truly an Old Hand

The Mural City sprawled across an area comparable to that of a small town, its streets a chaotic maze of varying widths and crooked paths. Towering buildings were scarce; instead, the place was dotted with numerous small shops no larger than blocks of tofu. Street vendors shouted their wares in a cacophony reminiscent of a country village filled with crowing roosters and barking dogs. Among the vibrant noise, many silent foot merchants squatted on the roadside, their sleeves drawn over their shoulders, indifferent to the passersby. Whether they chose to look or buy was entirely up to them.

The origins of the Mural City were a topic of much speculation, especially concerning the murals of celestial maidens that adorned its walls. With their myriad postures and alluring grace, they invited countless imaginations. The Pima Sect, responsible for establishing the city, remained tight-lipped about it.

Chen Ping'an walked at a leisurely pace, stopping intermittently, and after about the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, he followed a bustling crowd drawn to a particular mural. Standing before the mural, which towered over ten zhang (about 33 feet), he gazed upward. The artwork depicted a graceful goddess in profile, seemingly in motion, her eyes sparkling as if alive. Beneath her feet, auspicious clouds floated, and at her waist hung a small ancient inkstone, a rarity in the present day. Whether it was due to the lighting or the mural's ethereal energy, the goddess's gaze seemed to shimmer with vitality.

This mural, later known as the “Hanging Inkstone,” primarily featured shades of azure and green but was also accentuated with just the right amount of gold leaf, lending it a weighty yet celestial aura. At first glance, it appeared simple, akin to flowing script in a book, but upon closer inspection, the intricacies of the folds in her garments, the details of her ornaments, and even the delicate texture of her skin and eyelashes were masterfully rendered, resembling a meticulous calligraphy copy.

It was evident that the artist was a masterful painter of extraordinary skill.

Although Chen Ping'an had only a rudimentary understanding of the elegant dialect of Beiju Luzhou, he could catch bits of conversation around him. Over the millennia, five of the eight murals in the underground city had been claimed by fortunate individuals, seemingly guided by fate. When these five goddesses stepped out of their murals to serve their masters, the murals would instantly lose their vibrancy, transforming into mere outlines, stripped of their former brilliance and spiritual energy. To prevent the murals from fading into obscurity over time, the Pima Sect had invited an old ancestor from a well-connected sect in Liu Xiazhou to cover the murals with a secret technique.

Most visitors came to admire the breathtaking beauty of the goddess depicted in the mural. Chen Ping'an, of course, glanced at her; it was a mural after all, and it was worth a look.

However, his attention was more captivated by the small ancient inkstone hanging from the goddess's waist. He could faintly make out the archaic inscription “Lightning” in seal script, recognizing it thanks to a book titled "True Works of Dan" gifted to him by Li Xisheng, which featured many rare seal characters that had long been lost in the vast realm of Haoran.

Nearby, a shop was selling replicas of the goddess mural, with prices varying significantly. The most expensive was a double-hooked hard yellow edition the size of a round fan, priced at twenty snowflake coins. Chen Ping'an found the artwork exquisite; it not only resembled the mural but also captured some of its spirit, prompting him to buy two copies—one for himself and one for Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian had once remarked that in matters of collection, one should avoid clutter and prioritize quality.

The shop was run by a pair of teenagers; the girl was somewhat aloof with customers, while the boy was particularly clever. When he noticed Chen Ping'an purchasing the most expensive piece, he eagerly recommended a set of five goddess images in a hard yellow edition, housed in a bright red wooden box. The boy mentioned that just the box itself cost several snowflake coins.

Chen Ping'an lightly brushed his fingers over the box, noting its refined wood and faint spiritual energy; it surely originated from a mountain of immortals.

The boy went on to explain that the other two goddess images were unavailable here and would require a trip to another store. Currently, three family-run shops remained in Mural City, bound by an agreement established by the older generations, which prohibited any merchant from poaching the business of another. However, the replicas of the five murals obscured by the Pima Sect could be sold by all three shops.

After considering it, Chen Ping'an decided to look around some more and pocketed the “Hanging Inkstone” mural before leaving the shop.

As for the goddess's fortune, Chen Ping'an didn't give it much thought.

He overheard customers discussing that once a goddess stepped out of the mural, she would serve her master for life. Historically, the five figures from the murals had all formed immortal couples with their masters, and at least one of them, a down-and-out scholar with mediocre cultivation, had unexpectedly broken through many times with the help of a goddess, ultimately becoming a renowned immortal in Beiju Luzhou. It was indeed a case of marrying a beauty and becoming an immortal at the mountain's peak—what more could one ask for in life?

At that moment, Chen Ping'an felt his palms grow sweaty and quickly took a sip of wine to calm his nerves, silently praying that the goddess's standards were high enough not to fall for someone like him.

Afterward, Chen Ping'an visited the other two murals. Again, he purchased the most expensive hard yellow edition, which was the same style. The nearby shop also had a set of five goddess images for sale, priced at one hundred snowflake coins, with no discounts. The two additional goddess murals were named “Rain Bringer” and “Deer Rider.” The former depicted a goddess holding a jade bowl, slightly tilted, with a shimmering reflection revealing a golden dragon inside. The latter showed a goddess riding a colorful deer, her garments flowing like mist, and she carried a green wooden sword inscribed with the words “Swift Wind.”

As he continued his stroll among the crowd, Chen Ping'an listened attentively, absorbing information.

One conversation caught his attention, stirring his ambition to become a merchant during his time in Beiju Luzhou. Besides honing his sword skills, he thought it might not be a bad idea to engage in some trading; after all, he had a wealth of items at his disposal.

He heard someone mention that the goddess images from Mural City were renowned for their stunning artistry and had become well-known throughout the continent. In the northern regions of Beiju Luzhou, many cultivators were willing to pay high prices, and the images were particularly sought after in the court and among wealthy immortal masters, with some even willing to part with five small summer coins for a complete set of eight images.

Chen Ping'an contemplated this and initially thought it was a lucrative opportunity, but then he sensed something was off. It felt like picking up a pile of copper coins left on the ground; any cultivator with a bit of wealth could easily take advantage of the price difference. So, he took a closer look at a nearby group of chatting tourists, realizing they didn’t seem like employees of the three shops. Upon further reflection, he began to understand that in the vast territory of Beiju Luzhou, particularly in the southern region of the Bone Marsh, taking a fairy boat was already a considerable expense. Selling goddess images for high prices depended greatly on whether the buyer had a personal attachment to them, making it more about fate and luck. Additionally, it was uncertain how many hard yellow editions were available among the three shops; collectively, it might not be worth the effort for cultivators to pursue such small profits.

Of course, it was also possible that the shops and the Pima Sect had established a fixed sales route that outsiders were unaware of.

As for earning money, among the people Chen Ping'an knew, Sun Jiashu from Old Dragon City and Dong Shuijing from Longquan County were the best at it. Not to mention Sun Jiashu's already vast wealth, it was Dong Shuijing's attitude toward making money that Chen Ping'an admired the most. Despite already earning a significant income, Dong Shuijing maintained connections with high-ranking officials and was still diligent about running his wonton shop. Some may say he was merely cultivating his temperament after becoming wealthy, but he continued to work diligently without any hint of laziness.

This was the mindset a businessman should possess.

Therefore, at both shops, Chen Ping'an sought out the shopkeepers and inquired if he could receive a discount for buying multiple hard yellow editions at once. One shopkeeper flatly refused, stating that even if Chen Ping'an bought all the stock, the price wouldn’t budge by a single snowflake coin. The other shop was run by a hunchbacked old woman who, with a smile, asked how many sets of goddess images he intended to buy. After Chen Ping'an inquired about the shop's remaining stock, the old woman explained that hard yellow editions were delicate and slow to produce. The main artist responsible for these goddess images was an old guest painter of the Pima Sect, and other artists didn’t dare to take up the brush. The old guest painter was never inclined to create more pieces, and if it weren’t for the Pima Sect’s rules, he claimed that every time he painted for someone with malicious intentions, he incurred additional karma. 

The old woman then candidly stated that the shop was not worried about sales, as they couldn’t hold onto stock for long. Currently, they had only about thirty sets left, which would sell out sooner or later. She chuckled and remarked that offering a discount would equate to losing money—who would conduct business that way?

With no options left, Chen Ping'an, swayed by the old woman's sincere words, purchased a set for twenty snowflake coins. The five goddess images were named “Long Canopy,” “Treasure Canopy,” “Lingzhi,” “Spring Official,” and “Executioner.” Each goddess held a lotus lamp, sheltered under a treasure canopy, cradled a white jade lingzhi, and was surrounded by flowers and birds. The final figure stood out, armed with a hefty axe, radiating a formidable presence.

Chen Ping'an returned to the first shop to inquire about the stock of hard yellow editions and any potential discounts. The boy seemed hesitant, while the girl suddenly laughed and glanced at him, shaking her head as if to scold him for being too mercenary. She continued attending to customers, maintaining her aloof demeanor.

Ultimately, the boy, possibly feeling embarrassed under Chen Ping'an's cheerful gaze, led him secretly to the back room and sold him ten sets of wooden boxes, charging him only ten fewer snowflake coins.

After settling the payment and leaving the shop, Chen Ping'an found himself carrying an extra package slung over his shoulder.

The girl nudged the boy with her shoulder and teased, “How can you conduct business like that? One little customer presses you for a few words, and you give in!”

The boy sighed, “I’m just following my great-grandfather’s style. Besides, I only help you out; I’m not really a businessman.”

The girl, maintaining her professional demeanor, warned, “I don’t care—if you lose ten snowflake coins here, I’m keeping an eye on you. Make sure you recover it from your great-grandfather later. Ask him to paint more for my shop!”

The boy nodded with a grin, “Don’t worry, my great-grandfather dotes on me. If others can’t get anything from him, I can just ask, and he’ll be more than happy to oblige.”

Suddenly, the girl added, “Did you at least warn that customer about not displaying his wealth? There are many eyes here, and with him carrying so many hard yellow editions, it’s no small amount. The area around Mural City is notorious for being a den of thieves, preying on outsiders with all sorts of scams—you didn’t even give him a heads-up? Just look at the way he bargained, almost as if he could join our shop as a worker. And with that accent, it’s clear he’s not particularly wealthy. The more reason to be careful!”

In her dealings, the girl typically adhered to the principle of "buyers beware," but she was unusually protective when it came to the boy, revealing a warm-hearted side to her otherwise cold demeanor.

The boy, taken aback, slapped his forehead, “I completely forgot!”

The girl glared at him, lowering her voice, “Then hurry up! You’re a direct disciple of the Pima Sect and about to embark on your journey; how can you be so naive in your dealings?”

The boy replied, “What about the shop? How will we manage?”

The girl chuckled, “I’ve been here all along; you’ve only helped out a few times. Do you really think my shop can’t survive without you?”

The boy dashed out of the shop and found the traveler with the conical hat, quietly warning him to be cautious.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Thanks for the reminder.”

The boy waved his hand and turned to return to the shop.

Chen Ping'an then asked, “Can I ask you something?”

The boy stopped and nodded, “Feel free to ask. I’ll answer anything I can.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “With the fate tied to these eight goddess murals, why hasn’t the Pima Sect secured them? Even if their own disciples can’t seize the fortune, isn’t it common sense to keep the good fortune within?”

The boy chuckled, “The Pima Sect isn’t that petty. Rather than hoard this treasure and monopolize the fortune, it’s better to build goodwill with those who are destined to it. The Pima Sect has a saying: ‘In our pursuit of the Dao, we must avoid contention with others.’”

After reflecting on these words, Chen Ping'an remarked, “The Pima Sect has quite the vision!”

The boy laughed heartily. Despite his short stature and unremarkable looks, he was an inner disciple of the Pima Sect’s ancestral hall, possessing considerable cultivation. Though young, he held a relatively high status, having numerous elder cultivators at the sect refer to him as “little master uncle” due to his close ties with the shopkeeper’s family.

After thanking the boy, Chen Ping'an proceeded toward the entrance. Having purchased the goddess images as a foundation for his future ventures in Beiju Luzhou, he decided not to linger in Mural City any longer. He had already seen various shops selling ghostly artifacts, and while the quality varied, the prices were undeniably high. It was clear that the true treasures and top-tier goods would require time and effort to uncover, hidden in the depths of the alleyways, and he had no intention of relying on luck. Moreover, since he had already acquired the finest ghostly puppet as an attendant, he felt no need for additional purchases. Thus, he set out toward the Ruoyue River Temple, located six hundred miles away from the Pima Sect’s mountain.

Upon exiting Mural City, he glanced back at the misty peaks of the Pima Sect, reminiscent of Taiping Mountain in Tongyezhou.

The foot of the mountain was bustling with activity, filled with people. For a sect with thirty-six direct disciples and one hundred and eight outer disciples, there were surprisingly few cultivators around, leaving much of the mountain tranquil and deserted.

In fact, his own run-down mountain was somewhat similar.

There were simply too few people. Yet, he worried that if the place became too crowded, it might attract a second Gu Can; even half of Gu Can would be a headache for him.

There was a saying in Daoism about a simpleton worrying about the sky. Chen Ping'an had read it many times and found it increasingly thought-provoking.

He took out his sword-raising gourd, took a sip of wine, shifted the bundle on his back, and gathered his thoughts before continuing his journey.

He still walked on foot.

As for the pace of his breathing and the depth of his steps, he deliberately maintained the demeanor of an ordinary martial artist.

The Ruoyue River Temple was easy to find; he simply needed to reach the banks of the Ruoyue River and head north. The Guixie Valley was located to the northeast of the temple, making it a somewhat convenient route.

The Ruoyue River was vast and boundless, with deep waters flowing gently, reminiscent of a serene lake.

There were no bridges across the Ruoyue River, as it was said that the river god disliked others walking over his head. Therefore, all ferry crossings and boats were used. Chen Ping'an took a break at a small ferry port, enjoying a bowl of the local shadow tea. Typically, river water was considered inferior for brewing tea, but the shadow tea here, drawn from the river, was exceptionally refreshing and sweet—likely due to the rich essence of the Ruoyue River.

The waterway was flourishing, benefiting the flora and fauna on both banks. Dense patches of reeds remained green even in early winter, providing a habitat for many waterfowl.

As he walked, he occasionally spotted wandering cultivators accompanied by well-armed ghostly attendants. Their steps were light, barely stirring the dust, akin to skilled martial artists from smaller nations in the Baoping Continent, adorned in exquisite armor engraved with Daoist symbols, glimmering with golden and silver threads—definitely not ordinary merchandise. The imposing ghostly figures were mostly clad in masks, with only a hint of dark skin visible.

Each region nurtured its own people. Compared to the cautious demeanor of cultivators from Baoping Continent, those in Beiju Luzhou appeared more unrestrained and free-spirited.

If Pei Qian were here, she would likely feel right at home.

Chen Ping'an ordered two more bowls of shadow tea, not because he was particularly thirsty, but because the tea stand had a rule: three bowls of tea cost one snowflake coin, and drinking less than three still incurred the same price.

With no rush to continue on his journey, Chen Ping'an leisurely savored his tea. At the same time, he noticed most of the tables were filled with patrons resting, and ahead, there was an ancient site. Along the banks of the Ruoyue River, there lay a fallen ancient iron bull, its origins unknown, but its quality was extremely high, approaching that of a magical artifact. It had neither been submerged in the river by the river god nor claimed by the mighty cultivators of the Bone Marsh. Once, a land immortal had attempted to steal it, but his outcome was grim. The river god had seemingly ignored the theft, yet the river swelled violently, sweeping the Golden Core land immortal into its depths, drowning him. Afterward, no one dared to covet the iron bull, which weighed several tens of thousands of pounds.

Just as Chen Ping'an finished his second cup of tea, he heard a nearby table of customers arguing with the tea stand's staff about why the tea shop charged two snowflake coins for four bowls of tea.

The shopkeeper, a lazy man, watched the commotion with a smirk as his staff argued vehemently with the customers. He remained seated, drinking quietly with a plate of delicious water celery, which thrived near the Ruoyue River. The young staff member, with a fiery temperament, stood his ground against four customers while insisting they either pay two snowflake coins or leave without paying, stating that the tea shop wouldn’t accept a single coin less.

A robust man with a shaggy purple beard, flanked by a formidable ghostly attendant crafted by the Pima Sect, slammed a small summer coin on the table. “Two snowflake coins, right? Then hand me my change!”

This was clearly an attempt to bully the tea stand.

Cultivators and martial artists usually carried plenty of snowflake coins on their journeys, so they shouldn’t lack for money. While small summer coins were easier to carry, those who possessed treasures like small immortal mounds or exquisite armories would have varying circumstances. 

As for the more valuable Gu Yu coins, they were not as commonly needed, as only a few locations required them, typically for significant transactions.

The young staff member shot back, “Why don’t you pull out a Gu Yu coin?”

The purple-bearded man glared, folding his arms, “Enough chatter, hurry up! Don’t delay me from offering incense to the river god!” 

Finally, the shopkeeper intervened, saying, “Alright, hurry up and give the customer his change.”

The young staff grabbed the summer coin and went to the back of the counter, squatting down. The sound of coins clinking rang out as he pulled out a bag filled with snowflake coins, slamming it onto the table. “Take it!”

The purple-bearded man grinned and gestured for his ghostly attendant to pick up the heavy bag of snowflake coins and place it in the box behind him.

The young staff member, with a stern expression, said, “No fare for you. Don’t come back.”

The purple-bearded man pulled out another summer coin and grinned, “I’ll have four more bowls of shadow tea.”

The young staff member, furious, shouted, “Are you done yet?!”

The woman sitting cross-legged on the bench turned around. Though average in appearance, her curves were enticing, and as she twisted, her figure became even more pronounced. She smiled at the young staff member and said, “Since this is a business meant to welcome customers, temper your anger a bit. But don’t worry, I won’t blame you. It’s normal for young people to be hot-headed. I won’t drink that bowl of tea and will consider it a reward for you to cool your temper.”

The other patrons at the nearby tables erupted with laughter, some whistling and calling out, while a few younger men couldn’t help but gawk at her, wishing to take home the view.

The young staff member, humiliated, was about to berate the teasing woman when a young swordsman beside her was already preparing to draw his sword, seemingly waiting for the staff member to insult her.

Fortunately, the shopkeeper finally put down his chopsticks and spoke to the young staff member, “Have you forgotten what I taught you? Insulting customers only leads to trouble. The tea shop has rules established by our ancestors; it’s no wonder you’re strong, but if the customer is unhappy, we can’t do anything about it. Insulting them is not how business is conducted.”

He then smiled at the group of guests, “There are rules in business, but as this lovely lady said, we’re here to welcome customers, so let me treat you to these four bowls of shadow tea as a way to get to know you four fine gentlemen. How does that sound?”

The woman covered her mouth, chuckling, her charm captivating all.

The purple-bearded man nodded, pocketing the summer coin and enjoying the newly served shadow tea without charge before rising to leave.

The woman didn’t forget to throw a flirtatious glance back at the young staff member.

Chen Ping'an furrowed his brow, glancing at one of the remaining bowls of tea on the table, noticing a faint trace of rouge on the rim.

The shopkeeper shook his head, smiling, and stepped out from behind the counter, tossing the bowl into the waters of the Ruoyue River.

After finishing his tea, Chen Ping'an placed a snowflake coin on the table and stood to leave.

As he walked from Mural City to the ferry, he encountered a fork in the road. The smaller path ran alongside the river, while the larger road veered away. There was a reason for this; the river god preferred tranquility over noise. The main road leading to the Bone Marsh was busy and bustling, which could disturb the river god’s peace. Thus, the Pima Sect funded the creation of two pathways for travelers: the scenic route for those who enjoyed the view and the main road for those conducting business, ensuring that both paths remained distinct.

Chen Ping'an chose the smaller path, which was less crowded. After all, the scenic beauty of the Ruoyue River was just a tranquil river, and the novelty had worn off as he walked from Mural City. Common tourists had lost their excitement, and the uneven dirt path couldn’t compare to the smooth main road, where there were also stalls set up along the way. After all, setting up stalls in Mural City required a fee—though not much, just a snowflake coin, but even a mosquito's leg is meat.

As Chen Ping'an walked along the riverside path for several miles, he vaguely heard a weak scolding from a clump of reeds nearby. Four people staggered out, among them the woman who had previously argued with the tea stand. Suddenly, a thunderous rumble erupted from her abdomen, and she gasped, “Oh no, it’s coming again!” She turned and hurriedly ran back into the depths of the reeds, warning, “Make sure your puppet keeps its distance; in this wilderness, I won’t let a wild man see my backside, nor will I let a ghost take advantage of me!”

Ignoring her, Chen Ping'an quickened his pace.

The purple-bearded man glanced at Chen Ping'an.

The young swordsman beside him whispered, “What a coincidence! Is this a trap set up by the tea stand? They saw him as a target earlier and now plan to take advantage of him?”

An elderly man dressed like a steward rubbed his aching stomach and nodded, “Best to be cautious.”

The purple-bearded man’s face darkened. “I didn’t expect this Bone Marsh to be so lawless. Even a tea stand would stoop to such underhanded tactics!”

The gray-clad elder sighed, “Bone Marsh has always been home to strange people. Let’s consider this a lesson learned. We should think about our next steps; if that tea stand is indeed scheming, the path to the river god’s temple will be perilous.”

The young man looked toward the traveler in the conical hat and made a slicing gesture with his hand. “Then let’s take the initiative. It’s better than letting them probe us first, then catching us off guard somewhere. We might scare them into retreating.”

The purple-bearded man considered this a reasonable plan. The gray-clad elder wanted to strategize further, but the man had already instructed the swordsman, “Go test the waters. Remember to keep it clean; if we need to rely on the river god’s protection, we can’t afford to offend him. Throwing a corpse in the river would surely antagonize him, and with so many reeds around, let’s not waste the opportunity.”

The swordsman nodded with a grin, “He looks like a simple martial artist who’s gone through body tempering. If he happens to be a hidden gem with a hero’s heart, it won’t be easy to catch him.”

The purple-bearded man glanced at the gray-clad elder, who silently nodded.

The two stealthily advanced.

Moments later, the purple-bearded man, still rubbing his stomach, noticed the two returning, and he asked, “How did it go?”

The gray-clad elder shook his head, “He vanished in an instant, quicker than a rabbit. But he might also be hiding among the reeds; it’s hard to find him if he’s lying low.”

The purple-bearded man’s expression darkened as he looked around. “Then we’re out of options. Let’s walk a bit further, and if nothing comes of it, we’ll head back to the ferry and apologize to that tea stand owner. We can’t afford to clash with a local.”

The woman emerged from the reeds, hands on her hips, waddling out, looking frail. “That tea stand is infuriating! Those scoundrels, with their deceitful methods! It’s such a potent laxative that even a strong bull like me was brought down. They don’t know how to cherish beauty!”

Chen Ping'an had previously stepped off the small path, slipping into the reeds. After walking for about twenty miles, he slowed down, scooped some water from the river to wash his face, and then, taking advantage of the solitude, placed the bundle containing the goddess images into his dimensional pouch. With that, he leaped lightly onto the thick reeds, skimming the surface like a dragonfly, the wind whistling past his ears as he floated away.

That band of wanderers, even with their ghostly puppets as attendants, probably didn’t measure up to an experienced Dragon Gate realm cultivator. Chen Ping'an had no desire to engage in conflict upon arriving in Beiju Luzhou, especially when he was just passing through.

As he neared the river god’s temple, he noticed more pedestrians on the small path. Chen Ping'an landed gracefully and walked out of the reeds.

Earlier, standing atop the reeds and gazing at the renowned temple known throughout half the continent, he observed a thick column of incense smoke rising into the sky, swirling through the clouds overhead, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that was hard to overlook. Even the water god temples he passed through in Tongyezhou and the Biyou Palace that followed didn’t possess such an extraordinary aura, nor did the several river god temples along the Xiuhua River back in his hometown.

Common folk burned their incense, while wealthy patrons burned special incense. 

The river god temple was quite generous, with a wooden sign stating the rules, and a young boy stationed nearby informing all visitors that sincerity was what mattered when offering incense, not the price of the offerings.

Chen Ping'an didn’t skimp on this; he purchased a tube of Ruoyue River incense specially made for the temple, which was quite pricey—ten snowflake coins for just nine sticks of incense. Compared to the three sticks for one snowflake coin at the river god temple in Qingluan Country, this was significantly more expensive.

From the intricately patterned yellow bamboo incense tube, he pulled out three sticks and followed the other incense visitors into the temple. In the main hall, he lit three sticks, held them high above his head, and bowed in all directions before proceeding to the main hall housing the river god's statue, which exuded an imposing presence. The colorful statue was gilded, towering higher than the iron statue of the river god of the Tiefu River in Longquan County, even exceeding it by several feet. The water deities of the Dali Dynasty adhered strictly to the regulations set forth by the academies. Chen Ping'an thought this was typical of Beiju Luzhou, where the Ruoyue River god was depicted as an elderly man clad in golden armor, holding a sword in each hand, standing atop a vibrant red serpent, with a fierce and formidable demeanor.

After wandering through the vast temple for over half an hour, Chen Ping'an finally left. The rooftops were adorned with gleaming golden tiles.

Among the side halls, one was designed to resemble a dragon palace under the water, with lifelike statues of large fish and snakes transformed into human form as their generals. The old incense patrons joked with their children, saying this was the river god's other palace. At night, these powerful figures would come alive, but due to the temple’s nighttime restrictions, only those divine beings capable of soaring through the clouds could visit the temple in the evening and share drinks and tea with the river god.

Chen Ping'an had paused briefly in the back hall and noticed a couplet hanging there. He pulled out three more sticks of incense, lit them, and respectfully stood on the white jade plaza, placing them in the incense burner before leaving.

Behind him, the black-background golden couplet read: “Sincerity alone merits a bow; wickedness only brings the river god's wrath.”

After leaving the river god temple, Chen Ping'an continued his journey north.

As the sun dipped behind the western hills, he arrived at a small ferry where he needed to take a boat across to reach the Guixie Valley, a place he was eager to explore within the Bone Marsh jurisdiction.

However, the ferryman and his crew had already finished their shifts for the day, with boats tied and returning home. Chen Ping'an tried to offer more money to cross, but no one accepted, citing a longstanding rule that ferries did not operate at night, lest the river god become angered. Only three types of individuals were exceptions: scholars rushing to the capital for exams, those seeking medical help, and the desperate wishing to end their lives in the river.

Considering the river god's preference for no bridges and these rules, Chen Ping'an abandoned his intent to cross and instead found a quiet spot near the ferry terminal, lighting a fire to wait until morning to cross.

Night fell, and the river flowed gently.

Facing the waters, Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, practicing his sword stance.

The night passed without incident.

At dawn, Chen Ping'an approached the ferry, where an elderly ferryman with dark, oily skin was already waiting for passengers.

After negotiating a price of eight coins, the old man suggested waiting a bit longer. Carrying only one passenger across for a mere eight coins felt insufficient for the effort. If another person were to join, they could earn an additional eight coins, so he asked Chen Ping'an if he was willing to wait. Chen Ping'an smiled and said he didn’t mind waiting, as he wasn’t in a hurry.

Chen Ping'an removed his hat and sat beside the old ferryman, taking a sip from his sword-raising gourd, which contained homemade wine gifted to him by Dong Shuijing from his run-down mountain.

The old ferryman, catching a whiff of the fragrant wine, brightened up and turned to Chen Ping'an, asking, “Young sir, may I have a taste of your wine?”

Chen Ping'an was about to offer his gourd, but the old man waved his hands and said, “You are a gentleman of taste; I can’t just take it without offering. Just pour it into my hands.”

So, Chen Ping'an poured some wine into the old man’s weathered palms. The ferryman, lowering his head like a cow drinking water, savored it before smacking his lips and asking, “Are you heading to that place called ‘No Turning Back’? Oh, that’s our local dialect; according to the Pima Sect old masters, it refers to the Guixie Valley.”

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, “I’ve come to experience it. As a swordsman, they say one must visit three places in the Bone Marsh: I’ve already been to Mural City and the river god temple, and now I want to see the Guixie Valley and broaden my horizons.”

The old man extended two fingers, teasingly tugging at the edge of Chen Ping'an's garment, “I knew it! You’re actually a young immortal. I’ve lived my life ferrying people across this river, but if the coins in my pocket don’t jingle, I still have eyes to see, and your outfit must be worth a fortune!”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “When one ventures out, it’s important to maintain an air of dignity; sometimes, one must put on a brave front.”

The old ferryman replied, “With your accent, it’s clear you’re from another continent. You should take care to adjust it; in a big forest, all kinds of birds exist. The less capable ones tend to band together to bully the weak.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “You’re right, elder.”

The ferryman turned to glance over his shoulder, “You’re in luck; it seems we have another passenger coming to the ferry, so we can cross soon.”

Chen Ping'an followed the old man’s gaze and turned to see a hunchbacked old woman slowly approaching. Upon getting a closer look at her face, Chen Ping'an felt a bit helpless.

When the old woman reached the ferry and heard the old ferryman quote the fare of eight coins, she began to frown. Turning to Chen Ping'an, she put on a façade of innocence and asked if he could lend her some money, explaining that she only had four or five coins on her.

Chen Ping'an simply shook his head.

The old ferryman grew anxious and shot Chen Ping'an a look, but to his dismay, the young man appeared oblivious.

In the end, the old woman huffed, declaring she would owe him money and come back another time, and the old ferryman reluctantly agreed.

As they crossed the river, the atmosphere on the boat was a bit awkward. 

Chen Ping'an sat silently, pretending to meditate.

The old ferryman felt anxious but didn’t know how to address it.

The old woman was furious, feeling that the young man was miserly and stingy. 

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became, shooting an irritated glance at Chen Ping'an.

He pretended not to notice.

She seemed unable to suppress her frustration, launching into a long-winded lecture about how one shouldn’t blame others for being stingy.

The old woman slammed her hand against the boat railing.

The old ferryman rolled his eyes.

When they finally arrived at the opposite bank, the old ferryman had just begun to say something when the old woman seized his sleeve.

Chen Ping'an jumped off the boat, bid them farewell without turning back, and walked away.

The old ferryman stared in disbelief, taken aback, and after a moment, turned to the “old woman” beside him. “That’s it? Aren’t you upset?”

Straightening herself, the hunchbacked woman smirked, “What else could I do? Am I supposed to pay him? He’s the one who missed the opportunity! Three little tests he couldn’t even pass. If this word gets out, I’ll be the laughing stock among my sisters!”

The old ferryman couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.

Why did it seem like that young man was intentionally ignoring this golden opportunity?

The first test had been set by the “old woman” to see if he would force his way across the river. He passed that. The second test was symbolic, allowing him to drink a bit of wine. After that, the old ferryman thought everything was settled, so he sold the young man a small favor, deliberately dropping hints to let him know what was going on. Having already visited the river god temple, he should have noticed something was off and acted appropriately. There was no way he would be so stingy over a few coins. Who had just said, “In the world of wandering, one must put on a brave front?”

The old woman was furious and stomped her foot, causing both the ferryman and the boat to sink into the waters of the Ruoyue River.

The two of them navigated effortlessly through the depths.

The old woman had shed her hunchbacked form, revealing her true beauty—her flowing ribbons and enchanting appearance were those of a goddess.

The old ferryman sighed, regretting the missed opportunity for the young man.

After leaving the ferry terminal, Chen Ping'an began to sprint, regretting that flying on his sword would attract too much attention; otherwise, he could have gotten away even faster.

Taking a big swig from his sword-raising gourd to calm his nerves, he then laughed, feeling pleased with himself, “I, Chen Ping'an, am truly an old hand!”

After laughing, however, a wave of trepidation washed over him. He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, relieved that he had acted wisely. Otherwise, how many times would he have faced the wrath of Miss Ning? Even without the threat of injury, how could he still hope to embrace her next time?

At the opposite ferry terminal, Jiang Shangzhen had sensed something unusual earlier and had returned decisively. Now, he covered his forehead with his hand and murmured, “Chen Ping'an, Brother Chen, Old Master Chen! You are impressive after all!”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 560: Within the Scroll

The old ferryman continued to pole his boat along the riverbed, the vessel darting downstream like a playful fish, swift as the wind and lightning. 

To the eyes of ordinary mortals, the murky waters were unclear and muddled, but to the old ferryman, they were as transparent as daylight. The sparkling essence of the river’s flow was a delightful sight to behold. 

On the route to the River God’s temple, it was not uncommon for wandering souls and lost spirits to drift by. Upon seeing the old ferryman, they would instinctively kneel and bow their heads in respect. 

The rich, swirling waters of the river, combined with the River God’s restraint from greedily hoarding the essence, meant that the vengeful spirits who drowned here were less likely to turn into mindless, malevolent ghosts. This was a merit of sorts; however, the price the temple paid for such a blessing was a slower accumulation of incense essence. Year after year, this meant a loss of one pound this year, eight ounces next year—substantial amounts that could have been used to cultivate and refine their divine bodies. In the eyes of the gods of other rivers, they might think the River God was simply losing his mind.

As a deity dependent on human incense offerings, the River God was not a practitioner of the Dao. Notably, the temple did not recognize any dynasty’s geographical records, which made the attitude of monarchs and feudal lords along the river toward the temple quite nuanced. They neither formally sanctioned nor prohibited the people from traveling south to pay their respects, nor did they obstruct travelers at the various checkpoints along the way. Thus, the River God, Xue Yuansheng, remained a water spirit not bound by the proper rites of the continent, foolishly chasing after the elusive concept of merit—an endeavor akin to drawing water with a bamboo basket. What was the significance in planting trees here only for them to blossom elsewhere?

Merit was a fickle thing, difficult to predict by heavenly will. If one were to enter the records of the deities, it would mean there was a basis for recognition. As long as the local fortunes were stable and the Ministry of Rites performed their checks in accordance with the rules, rewards could be bestowed. The resulting benefits would help mitigate many karmic obstacles, thus ensuring a steady harvest. However, without that prestigious status, things became much more uncertain. Once a mortal’s prayer for blessings succeeded, who could guarantee that it wouldn’t lead to a tangled web of karmic consequences?

The goddess who emerged from the mural wore a gloomy expression, her mood visibly affected. 

In matters of their respective paths, the old ferryman, as a familiar neighbor, knew better than to say much. Words of comfort at this moment might only serve to rub salt in the wound. 

The eight murals depicting the heavenly officials had existed for ages, even predating the Pima Sect. When the early ancestors of the Pima Sect crossed continents to reach the North Julu Continent, the journey had been arduous. They chose to settle in the southernmost part of the continent out of necessity, having drawn the ire of several overbearing sword immortals from the north, making it impossible for them to establish themselves. Their desire to avoid trouble inadvertently led to the discovery of these ancient, enigmatic murals, thus designating the Bone Beach as a site of geomantic significance. The hardships faced during that period were not for outsiders to know, but the old ferryman had witnessed the Pima Sect’s gradual establishment firsthand. They had lost no fewer than twenty earth immortals dealing with the ancient battlefield’s lingering specters. Even two cultivators from the Jade Purity realm had perished in battle. It could be said that if they hadn’t been marginalized, and had been able to establish themselves in central North Julu, the Pima Sect today might very well be among the top five sects. This was especially true considering they had never invited sword immortals to serve as guardians of their mountain gate.

This was the first time the old ferryman had seen the goddess in her true form. Among the eight heavenly officials, one of them, the “Spring Official,” could traverse the dream realm, akin to the out-of-body experiences of high cultivators, completely disregarding numerous restrictions. She had once visited the River God’s temple, but shortly thereafter, like Chang Cheng and Zhan Kan, she had chosen a servant to accompany her and departed from the Bone Beach. At that time, they had made a secret pact: the old ferryman would assist them in setting up a couple of symbolic tests, and in return, they would aid him three times in times of need for the River God’s temple. After that, the Baogai and Lingzhi also left the mural city, and for five hundred years, three of the murals fell silent. The River God had since used up two of their chances to navigate crises, which is why the old ferryman was so invested in hoping for new opportunities to fall upon mortals or cultivators. He eagerly anticipated such outcomes.

Over the millennium, the winds of change had blown. Among the five goddesses depicted in the murals, one had perished while fighting for her master, and two had chosen to dissolve alongside him. Only the goddess known as “Zhan Kan,” along with the mysteriously vanished Spring Official, remained. The former had chosen a humble scholar who, at present, had become a peak cultivator in the realm of immortals, and was one of the few non-sword cultivators in the earlier expedition to the Upside-Down Mountain.

Currently, the goddess aboard the ferry was not accompanied by the colorful deer depicted in the mural. 

Perhaps this was why the mural had not faded; otherwise, the old ferryman would have felt embarrassed alongside the goddess. 

After a long wait, she finally selected a companion to share her journey, yet he turned out to be utterly oblivious, failing the simplest of tests, and promptly made his escape. 

If the mural city were to transform back into a mere outline, wouldn’t that leave the heavenly official feeling homeless? What would be the difference between her and the countless wandering spirits—those drowned souls and the specters of the Bone Beach? 

As for the true origins of these eight goddesses, even the old ferryman, as the local river god, was entirely unaware.

Most likely, the Pima Sect's cultivators also knew very little; the few surviving ancient ancestors probably had only a fragmentary understanding. 

The strangest part was how the Spring Official had, years ago, openly confided in the old ferryman during a secret meeting, admitting that they had lost their memories and didn’t know how long they had slept. It was only when the Pima Sect’s cultivators began to carve out their own caves and disturbed the formations that they awakened. The eight murals, while appearing to occupy separate corners of the mural city, were in fact interconnected, resembling a shattered secret realm. They had tried to deduce their origins using the mountain landscapes, flora, ancient texts, and other remnants contained within, but alas, they were met with insurmountable barriers and dense fog, unable to unravel the mystery.

As they neared the River God’s temple, the old ferryman couldn’t help but sigh. 

The goddess on the other side of the boat also sighed softly, her lamenting tone particularly poignant, akin to a celestial melody unheard by human ears. 

The old ferryman couldn’t help but feel a twinge of annoyance toward the young man earlier mentioned. What was he thinking? He had seemed quite clever while observing from the sidelines, adhering to the rules—far from being petty. So why, when fortune smiled upon him, did he suddenly act foolish? Was it simply destiny that he could not hold onto? Yet that didn’t seem right either; the very fact that the goddess cast her favor upon him and left the mural indicated much. 

The goddess turned her head slightly, “That man who was standing by the river earlier, he isn’t one of the three ancestors from the Pima Sect, is he?” 

The old ferryman shook his head. “I know the three ancestors on the mountain well. Even if they were to come down, they wouldn’t be the type to indulge in trickery.” 

The goddess pondered, “From his demeanor, I recall that a sister of mine once took a liking to a young foreign Golden Core cultivator. She nearly fell for him, but his disposition was simply too cold; being near him would be devoid of hardship or strife, yet it would also be utterly dull.” 

The old ferryman was taken aback and asked for the timeframe. 

After receiving an answer, he couldn’t help but grimace, muttering to himself, “Could it be that lecherous Jiang? He’s a truly despicable character.” 

To his surprise, the goddess nodded. “It seems his surname is indeed Jiang. He spoke with great confidence back then, claiming that one day, even if none of the celestial sisters would look upon him, he would still take all eight murals for himself, reverently offering them, so he could dine and drink while gazing at them every day. However, his words were frivolous, yet his heart was not without merit.” 

The old ferryman questioned, “This fellow was quite the flirt back then; how did he become so cold and dull?” 

The goddess shook her head. “Our methods of observing others go straight to the heart’s nature. Not only is it different from the way cultivators perceive things, but it also diverges from how you water deities see it. This is an innate ability of ours. We don’t consider it entirely beneficial, as all we see are murky hearts, filled with sordid thoughts. Whether it’s caves crawling with snakes and scorpions or alluring beings with human heads and animal bodies, the numerous grotesque images are unbearable to witness. Thus, we often choose to sleep deliberately, out of sight, out of mind. When we awaken unexpectedly, we know it’s time for an opportunity, and only then do we dare to open our eyes.” 

The old ferryman marveled, “What a wondrous world we live in.” 

Suddenly, the goddess riding the colorful deer turned her gaze toward the mural city, narrowing her eyes as her expression turned cold. “How dare he intrude upon our domain!” 

The old ferryman’s expression remained unchanged. 

He thought to himself that there was no need to guess; it must be that notorious Jiang Shangzhen. 

In the mural city, a large number of lanterns crafted from the mountain were suddenly extinguished. These lanterns were meant to burn brightly for a hundred years, requiring only infrequent replacement. Their malfunction naturally caused alarm. If a powerful cultivator were to battle here, the very foundation of the Pima Sect’s mountain formation could be harmed, leading to disastrous consequences for the mural city. Thus, several cultivators from the Pima Sect tasked with guarding the three murals took to the skies, searching for the culprit. If it was determined that a cultivator had destroyed the mural city with intentions to steal the paintings, they had the authority to execute him on the spot, acting first and reporting later.

Near one of the walls depicting the goddess image, while the Pima Sect’s guarding cultivators were momentarily distracted, a wisp of green smoke first slithered up the wall like a spirit snake, then instantaneously burst into the mural itself. Using an unknown technique, it directly broke through the mural’s celestial restrictions and vanished in the blink of an eye, causing a ripple like a raindrop hitting a lake. Even so, it caught the attention of a nearby earth immortal from the Pima Sect, who furrowed his brow and turned to look, unable to discern anything amiss. Still uneasy, he apologized to the mural goddess and soared to a spot ten feet away from the mural. He activated the unique techniques of the Pima Sect, and his eyes glimmered with a faint golden hue as he scrutinized the entire mural, determined not to miss any clue. After checking repeatedly, he ultimately found nothing out of the ordinary. 

The mural city retained only three of the eight murals, one of which was crucial among the heavenly images of the female officials. Within the Pima Sect’s secret archives, the goddess depicted rode a colorful deer and bore a wooden sword inscribed with “Swift as the Wind,” holding a respected position second only in importance to the goddess known as “Zhan Kan,” who had been bestowed with the title of “Immortal Staff.” This was why the Pima Sect had assigned a promising Golden Core earth immortal to oversee it.

The middle-aged cultivator had not found any answers but remained cautious. After a moment’s hesitation, he glanced toward the store near the “Lightning” goddess mural, using the soft ripples of his heart lake to convey to the young man to return to the Pima Sect’s ancestral mountain at once, and to inform the ancestor that something was amiss with the deer-riding goddess.

Though the young man had been helping his childhood friend with business earlier and seemed slow-witted, he was remarkably steady in the face of significant matters. After bidding farewell to the girl, he stepped out of the store, his expression solemn. With two fingers forming a seal, he gently stamped his foot, summoning a land spirit from within the Pima Sect’s territory—a graceful maiden of tender years. She raised her arms high, presenting a sword of remarkable energy, unsheathed and gleaming. However, as she emerged from the depths of the Pima Sect, she used illusions to conceal her presence; below the earth immortal level, no one could see her.

The young man expressed his gratitude, and with his fingers together, he lightly brushed against the ancient sword, causing it to hum as it shot through the air. He stepped onto the sword, which soared toward the top of the mural city, nearly in a straight line, unimpeded by the heavy layers of earth enhanced by the mountain formation. The one person and one sword ascended into the sky, breaking through the “White Jade Belt” cloud sea of the Pima Sect’s ancestral mountain, swiftly heading to the ancestral hall.

The middle-aged cultivator landed back on the ground, stroking his beard with a smile. Though the young disciple wasn’t in the same branch as him in the ancestral hall, he was highly valued and liked by everyone in the sect. 

The Pima Sect had strict rules; aside from a select few, all other cultivators had to begin their ascent on foot from the Hanging Sword Pavilion halfway up the mountain. No matter how turbulent the weather became, they were required to walk. However, this boy, who had secretly recognized ownership of that semi-immortal weapon since childhood, was one of the exceptions. The middle-aged cultivator could have used flying swords to send messages back to the ancestral hall, but there were many underlying reasons for this procedure. Even the boy himself was unaware of them. This was the mystery of cultivating on the mountain: “Knowing something is not knowing.” If someone pointed it out and he seemed to understand, the opportunities that might have come to him could very well slip away.

Thus, it was better to let the boy report the matter, allowing him to bear some of the karmic consequences. While success wasn’t guaranteed, it was unlikely to result in anything negative. 

Though the Pima Sect had a vast capacity and didn’t mind outsiders taking away the blessings of the eight murals, the boy represented the greatest hope for the sect to seize an opportunity from the mural city since its inception. When the Pima Sect constructed their mountain formation, they had mobilized hundreds of puppets and mountain-moving monkeys, turning the mural city upside down for many miles. Many great cultivators, whose names were inscribed in the Pima Sect’s ancestral records, had failed to find the ancient sword left behind by the founder. This semi-immortal weapon, it was rumored, had countless connections to the deer-riding goddess, and thus the Pima Sect was determined to compete for this opportunity presented by the mural. Heaven grants, but if one does not take the opportunity, it only brings misfortune.

The young man soared above the cloud sea, riding the sword straight to the ancestral hall. 

The three founders of the Pima Sect were in separate places: one ancestor was in seclusion, another was stationed in the Ghost Valley, continuing to expand their territory. 

The only one responsible for overseeing the mountain was standing at the entrance of the ancestral hall, smiling as he asked, “Lanxi, why the hurry? Has something gone wrong with the mural city?” 

The sword-wielding young man repeated the message from his Golden Core senior brother. 

The elder’s brow furrowed. “Is it regarding the mural of the deer-riding goddess?” 

The young man nodded. 

The elder grasped the boy’s shoulder, and in an instant, the mountains and rivers compressed into a single space, transporting them to the mural city. He first sent the young man to the store, then approached the mural itself, his expression grave. 

The middle-aged Golden Core cultivator realized just how serious the situation was, beyond imagination. 

The elder chuckled coldly. “What a fine fellow—able to silently break through both of our restrictions and intrude into the secret realm.” 

The middle-aged cultivator’s complexion changed slightly. 

The elder waved his hand. “Be careful; it might be a feint to draw us away. You go protect Lanxi; there’s no need to be overly anxious. After all, it’s our territory. I’ll return to the ancestral hall to follow the proper rituals—burn incense and knock on the door.” 

The middle-aged cultivator nodded and headed toward the store. 

At the store, the young girl quietly asked, “What’s going on?” 

The young man replied with a smile, “I just made a trip to the ancestral hall.” 

As the middle-aged cultivator entered the store, the young man questioned, “Brother Yang, what brings you here?” 

The middle-aged cultivator chuckled. “Just taking a look around.” 

In front of them stood a young boy, though he had only achieved the cave-dwelling realm, he was the little disciple named Pang Lanxi. The boy’s grandfather was a guest elder of the Pima Sect, the primary contributor to the collection of all the goddess murals. With exceptional talent, Pang Lanxi was a prodigy, a sword immortal in the making, and also the sole disciple of one of the three ancestors—a revered figure in the Pima Sect known for his prowess in the southern part of North Julu. The ancestor had once vowed in the ancestral hall never to take more than one disciple in his lifetime, so he had accepted the young Pang Lanxi, making him the direct successor. This was a momentous occasion, but the eccentric elder had instructed the Pima Sect not to make a fuss about it, saying only, “There’s no rush; once my disciple reaches the Golden Core, we will feast with all.” After all, it wouldn’t take many years.

The middle-aged cultivator looked at the carefree Pang Lanxi, internally sighing. “Little disciple, this is a crucial juncture for your path.” 

Within a realm that resembled an immortal palace, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared, stumbling a bit as he shook his sleeves and laughed, “At last, my wish has been fulfilled; I can finally see the unparalleled grace of the heavenly sisters.” 

He called out lightly, “Hello, is anyone there?” 

He strolled slowly, taking in the breathtaking scenery of the celestial realm. Suddenly, he raised his hand to cover his eyes, muttering, “This is the private space of the heavenly sisters; I must not see what I shouldn’t.” 

To the north of the Bone Beach, a young female cultivator left her newly established sect’s mountain. As the youngest sect leader in North Julu’s history, she navigated a celestial ferry gifted by her brother, the Heavenly Lord, racing south. As a treasure of the immortals, the Streaming Cloud Boat was faster than cross-continental ferries, capable of seamlessly traversing hundreds of miles between two clouds, as if the cultivator had used the “Shrink the Earth” technique, vanishing in an instant, without a sound. 

Meanwhile, on the borders of the Bone Beach and the Ghost Valley, a young swordsman wearing a bamboo hat was purchasing a hefty tome detailing the precautions for traversing the Ghost Valley from the local guards. The book detailed many taboos and dangerous areas. He sat nearby basking in the sun, leisurely flipping through the pages, taking his time to pay the toll for passing through before entering the valley to hone his skills, sharpening his sword for the task ahead. 

On this warm winter day, the young man glanced up at the sky, noticing it was clear and sunny—a perfect day indeed. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 561: Deeply Rooted Affection

As Jiang Shangzhen wandered through this immortal realm, though it bore no name of a cave heaven, it surpassed any cave heaven he had ever encountered.

The place was adorned with exquisite towers and jade palaces, strange flowers and unusual grasses, with cranes calling out melodiously. The spiritual energy flowed abundantly like mist, and every step he took filled his heart with serenity. Jiang Shangzhen couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty around him. He considered himself well-traveled, having a renowned paradise in his grasp. Even after spending a whole cycle of years in the Lotus Blossom Paradise, he had mostly gone there to help his friend, Lu Fang, resolve his inner turmoil, while also taking the opportunity to enjoy and relax. There were not many cultivators like Jiang Shangzhen, who roamed freely like a carefree cloud or a wild crane. While ascending in cultivation was crucial, so were fortuitous encounters and blessings. The ancient wisdom of "accumulating strength over time" was something every cultivator had to acknowledge.

Jiang Shangzhen had once boldly declared his ambitions in the city of mural paintings, but ultimately, he did not capture the favor of the mural goddess. He had taken it lightly, driven more by curiosity. After returning to the Jade Gui Sect in Tongye Continent, he sought advice from the old sect master, Xun Yuan, about the secrets of the Pima Sect and the mural city. He had indeed asked the right person; Xun Yuan, an immortal realm cultivator, was well-versed in the affairs of numerous immortal maidens and goddesses to an almost alarming extent. Years ago, Xun Yuan had even made a special trip to the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven in the central land to catch a glimpse of the Lady of Qingshen Mountain. In the end, he lingered around Qingshen Mountain, reluctant to leave, and not only did he fail to meet her, but he almost missed out on inheriting the position of sect master. It was only thanks to the previous sect master, who sent a flying sword message to a great ascended cultivator with whom he had a longstanding friendship, that Xun Yuan was forcibly brought back from the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven. Rumor had it that upon returning to the sect, the ailing old sect master, who was on the verge of death, still had enough strength to scold Xun Yuan harshly, even throwing the sect master’s token onto the ground in anger. Of course, these were all hearsay; besides the old sect master and Xun Yuan, only a few elders of the Jade Gui Sect, who had long since turned their backs on worldly matters, were present. The old cultivators of the Jade Gui Sect would recount this tale as a humorous anecdote to their disciples.

However, Jiang Shangzhen felt that given the similar temperaments of that master and disciple, the rumors might indeed hold some truth. Perhaps one reason for the previous sect master’s fury was that Xun Yuan had failed to witness the Lady of Qingshen Mountain.

As Jiang Shangzhen lowered his hands, he walked with his arms behind his back, reflecting on some secret matters that were only whispered about among those who frequented the mountain peaks. He couldn’t help but sigh.

Looking at the breathtaking scenery around him, he felt a pang of sympathy for the immortal maidens.

Sect Master Xun Yuan once mentioned that the Pima Sect had chosen the Bone Marsh as the site for its establishment, with the opportunities presented by the eight mural goddesses being of utmost importance. Perhaps they had resolved from the very beginning to establish their sect at the southernmost point of the continent, and the supposed enmity with the local sword cultivators of Beijulu Continent was merely a facade, a deliberate cover to ensure their choice of location went unnoticed, as if they were "forced" to select the southern edge. Xun Yuan had perused many of the top secret records passed down through ancient families in the central land, particularly those of the Confucian lineage. He speculated that those eight heavenly maidens were somewhat akin to the current officials supervising the ancient heavenly court, ensuring that no deity abused their power, and thus, the goddesses depicted in the murals were likely to have held lowly yet significant positions in the ancient heavenly court.

As the heavenly court shattered and the divine path collapsed, ancient sages divided the world into distinct realms. Those ancient deities who had miraculously avoided total destruction were mostly exiled or confined to a few obscure "mountaintops" to atone for their past misdeeds, helping the world maintain harmony between rain and shine, water and fire.

It was said that within the Grand Hall of Zhenwu Mountain, the ancestral site of the military families of Baoping Continent, and the main hall of the Wind and Snow Temple, one could communicate directly with certain ancient deities. The Confucian academies did not prohibit this, while the prominent sects of Baoping, such as the Shen’gao Sect, and the Jiang family of Yunlin, who had produced several "Great Blessings," did not enjoy the same privilege.

Jiang Shangzhen shook his sleeves, filled with spiritual energy, so overwhelming that he felt as if he were walking along a mountain path after a rain, the mist and dew soaking his clothes. He thought that perhaps below the ascended realm, including himself, anyone who could cultivate here would greatly benefit. In contrast, for ascended cultivators, the density of spiritual energy in a place was no longer the most crucial factor.

Raising his arm, he sniffed his sleeve. “Ah, this is truly refreshing. It must be the fragrance of the immortal maidens.”

With a smile, Jiang Shangzhen looked up and noticed a mansion in the distance, its plaque’s golden characters faint and unclear, but the spiritual energy there was exceptionally rich. Immortal mist swirled around a goddess standing at the entrance, rising and falling around her waist, the "Lightning" inkstone hanging at her side faintly visible.

Another goddess perched atop the roof, her fingers gently spinning, summoning a lovely, swirling cloud that danced around her like a white bird. She looked down at Jiang Shangzhen, a playful smile on her lips.

The inkstone goddess coldly scoffed, “What great audacity! Relying on your Jade Purity realm cultivation, you dare to wander here alone with your Yin Spirit.”

The goddess of rain sitting on the roof smiled and said, “No wonder you managed to sneak past the Pima Sect’s mountain water formation and our heavenly palace's restrictions.”

Jiang Shangzhen bowed respectfully, “Sister Guayin, Sister Xingyu, it’s been many years. Jiang Shangzhen is honored to see you again. Truly a fortune earned from my ancestors, a blessing from three lifetimes.”

The inkstone goddess, with purple lightning swirling around her sleeves, clearly seemed displeased by Jiang Shangzhen’s smooth-talking. 

The goddess of rain inquired, “Outside the mural city, we once agreed with the Pima Sect that we wouldn’t pay too much attention. Has your true self come here looking for our sister?”

Amidst their exchange, a multicolored deer leaped gracefully across the rooftops in the distance, a spectacle of divine elegance.

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, his gaze fixed on the colorful deer, and curiously asked, “I’ve heard that the Shen’gao Sect of Baoping has an immortal maiden named He Xiaoliang, whose fortune surpasses that of the entire continent. Now she has established her own sect here in Julu Continent and is always accompanied by a divine deer. I wonder if this deer has any connection to her?”

The inkstone goddess, growing impatient, retorted, “You, a mere mortal, should swiftly exit the heavenly palace.”

Jiang Shangzhen’s expression turned solemn, replying earnestly, “If you two sisters are tired of me, feel free to scold or hit me; I won’t fight back. However, if it’s those Pima Sect cultivators trying to chase me away, I have no grand skills to speak of, but I do possess a bit of backbone and will absolutely not leave.”

Suddenly, the inkstone goddess was enveloped by surges of lightning, her clothes flaring like a purple celestial gown. It was clear she intended to take action herself, without needing the old ancestor of the Pima Sect to knock or burn incense to enter.

However, the slender, cloud-haired goddess of rain slowly descended beside the inkstone goddess, her graceful figure speaking softly, “Let’s wait for my sister to return.”

The inkstone goddess, not as gentle as the goddess of rain beside her, was still reluctant, wishing to teach this smooth-talking scoundrel a lesson. After all, a Jade Purity realm cultivator was nothing to fear, especially alone in their heavenly palace. Even if it were just her, she could easily expel him. Yet, the goddess of rain gently tugged at the inkstone goddess’s sleeve, causing her to relent. The purple lightning slowly flowed back into the ancient inkstone hung at her waist.

Outside the mural, three loud knocks echoed, resonating within the heavenly palace like the drums of divine beings, shaking the heavens and earth.

The goddess of rain looked up, whispering, “Master Guo Chi, it’s been a long time.”

Jiang Shangzhen turned his gaze upward, and through the sea of clouds, a pair of enormous embroidered shoes broke through the mist. By the time this immortal master descended, she had returned to her usual height.

She was an average-looking woman, not tall, but exuded an imposing aura. At her waist hung a法刀 (law knife) with a dragon-holding-pearl design.

Even Jiang Shangzhen felt a headache coming on. This woman might not be visually striking, but her temper was truly foul. He had suffered under her hand before; back when they were both Golden Core realm earth immortals, she had crossed mountains and rivers for several months, chasing him down due to a mere “rumor” about him. They had fought three times, but Jiang Shangzhen couldn’t bring himself to go all out against a woman. Moreover, she held a special identity as the only daughter of the then Pima Sect master, and he didn't want his return journey to be obstructed by a group of mindless thugs.

Now, this Master Guo Chi was the sect master of the Pima Sect, having managed to climb into the Jade Purity realm, but her future prospects were not exactly bright. The Pima Sect traditionally did not prioritize cultivation level when selecting a leader; it often fell to whoever had the toughest temperament, willing to make sacrifices for the sect. Thus, Jiang Shangzhen’s reluctance to linger in the Bone Marsh, where he had to follow Chen Ping’an, was largely due to this woman he had once nicknamed “the Short-legged Tigress.”

Surprisingly, she was supposed to be killing in the Ghostly Valley, and if the Jade Purity realm sect master from the ancestral hall were to appear, Jiang Shangzhen wouldn’t be worried at all. When it came to the art of confrontation, he didn’t consider himself particularly skilled. Even in the vast realm of Haoran, he had earned a reputation for “a willow leaf that can cut down earth immortals” and “better to make an enemy of the Jade Gui Sect than to have Jiang Shangzhen in mind.” Yet, he had never taken these tales to heart. However, when it came to fleeing, he truly believed he had some talent and capability. Years ago, in his own Yun Ku Paradise, he had set up a deadly trap with the old ancestor of the sect against some rebellious forces, yet he still managed to escape. After he left, the Jade Gui Sect and Yun Ku Paradise soon faced bloody purges. The old Xun Yuan simply stood by and watched. As for the Jiang clan’s Yun Ku Paradise, it was a scene of utter devastation. All the earth immortals and those aspiring to become land immortals within the paradise had been directly killed by Jiang Shangzhen’s people, bursting open the “Heavenly Gate” and slaughtering their way through the entire paradise, leading to heavy losses for the Jiang clan, yet they decisively wiped it clean.

You see, Jiang Shangzhen had always had a saying that was quite popular in Tongye Continent: in love, one must seek longevity, but grievances from the previous night were like leftover food, unappetizing. He’d rather eat shit than not have it warm.

Master Guo Chi pressed her hand against the hilt of her knife, her gaze firmly fixed on the distant “guest,” smiling, “You’ve walked into a trap; don’t blame me for closing the door to beat the dog.”

Jiang Shangzhen blinked, seemingly failing to recognize Master Guo Chi at first, but after a moment, he suddenly realized, “Is it you, Quan’er? How have you grown so enchanting?! If one day you ascend to the immortal realm and simply change your appearance, you’d surely leave me astounded!”

The woman narrowed her eyes, one hand on the knife, the other extending, a smile that didn't reach her eyes, “I’ll grant you a few more words for your last words.”

Jiang Shangzhen gazed at the female cultivator, “Indeed, Quan’er is different from those hollow beauties; honestly, while you may not be the most striking in the world, you’ve always held a unique charm. Once a man sets eyes on you, it’s hard to forget.”

The woman chuckled, “Hmm, that sounds familiar. Do you remember Gao Liu from the Leize Sect? She was once one of the most beautiful women in the central part of Beijulu Continent, still single to this day. She once privately mentioned you to me, especially your way with words. She’s remembered it for years, still unable to forget. Jiang Shangzhen, it’s been years; your cultivation has improved, but why hasn’t your silver tongue made any progress? You disappoint me.”

Jiang Shangzhen maintained his composure, smiling, “It is indeed my fault. I’ve been so focused on my cultivation these past years that I’ve neglected my verbal skills. Quan’er, you’ve always been sincere to me, and from now on, I shall strive to improve for your sake.”

The inkstone goddess scoffed, “How on earth has this kind of person survived to today?”

The goddess of rain remarked, “Help Master Guo Chi when the time comes; I won’t stop you.”

Jiang Shangzhen looked around, “In this moment and place, it feels just like a peony blooming.”

Suddenly, the goddess of rain’s expression became serious.

She focused intently, her breath held, staring at a specific spot.

The inkstone goddess, sensing a threat, gestured for Master Guo Chi to wait a moment.

Within the mural city.

A young woman from Lion Peak stood beneath a mural of a goddess, reaching out, her voice calm, “Aren’t you coming out?”

At almost the same moment, the inkstone goddess also felt a tremor in her heart, turning her gaze to another direction, where a man from Beijulu Continent was gazing up at “her,” his expression weary, yet he smiled knowingly at the mural goddess, “My soul yearns for you, though we meet only in dreams, I’ve finally found you.”

By the banks of the Yao Yu River, the deer-riding goddess walked side by side with Jiang Shangzhen. Then, a swift-flowing boat plummeted down, and a woman sect master emerged. Upon seeing her, the deer-riding goddess felt as if the dust of confusion had been brushed away. Though she remained uncertain about the reasons behind it, she was undeniably sure that this grand young female leader was the true master she should follow and serve.

The exquisitely beautiful young female leader gazed at Jiang Shangzhen, furrowing her brow, “Are you his protector?”

This question came out of the blue.

Yet, Jiang Shangzhen instantly understood; the conclusion was clear, though the path was convoluted and unclear, it was irrelevant.

Jiang Shangzhen laughed heartily, “Where, where? I wouldn’t dare.”

The deer-riding goddess then said something that carried a lurking threat, “Just now, this person spoke ambiguously, implying I should follow that young wanderer, with ulterior motives that nearly jeopardized my fate with the master.”

Jiang Shangzhen rubbed his chin, looking pitiful, “Looks like Beijulu Continent doesn’t welcome me. It’s time for me to flee.”

The deer-riding goddess’s expression suddenly turned somber, and she whispered, “Master, my two sisters seem to have reached their opportunities as well. I didn’t expect that in a single day, we would part ways.”

The young female leader, who held the status of a sect master, did not seem to care. With her travel-worn expression, she furrowed her brow, unusually hesitant.

At this moment, Jiang Shangzhen began to feel astonished.

Because the young leader, whose identity he had already guessed, had developed a murderous intent.

In matters of love and affection between men and women on the mountain, hitting is love and scolding is affection; Jiang Shangzhen was most familiar with this.

Those willing to harbor murderous intent were truly rooted in deep affection; even when fate took them apart, they could not easily extricate themselves.

The young female leader ignored Jiang Shangzhen, smiling at the deer-riding goddess, “Let’s visit the Bone City of Ghostly Valley.”

The deer-riding goddess gently reminded, “Master, you’ve only barely entered the Jade Purity realm, your foundation is not yet stable; it may not be wise.”

The young leader shook her head, “It’s fine, it’s a trivial matter.”

She had important matters to resolve.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 562: Heading to the Capital to Observe the City**

At the entrance of Ghostly Valley, a row of massive archways stood tall. The most impressive among them was a grand structure featuring five openings, six columns, and eleven stories, adorned with precious yellow and green glazed tiles. Every dragon column was intricately carved with demon-slaying illustrations of the ancestors of the Pima Sect, and a plaque above read “Majestic and Spectacular.”

Cultivators and pure martial artists often had exceptional vision, but when Chen Ping'an had looked toward the archway earlier, he could barely see the road ahead, and it didn’t seem to be an illusion either. However, compared to the door leading to the Suspended Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, the mysteries of this archway didn’t astonish him much.

Chen Ping'an casually sat near the archway and flipped through a book for over an hour. He was meticulous in his reading and didn’t want to miss any detail, but having only read a small portion, he decided to rest at a nearby market inn for the night. Tomorrow, he would decide whether to explore the scenic outskirts of Ghostly Valley or pass through the archway to delve deeper into the valley for training—he wasn’t in a hurry.

Putting away his book, Chen Ping'an walked toward the bustling market. This market was managed by a small sect from the Bone Marsh, rented from the Pima Sect. Most businesses were run this way; the Pima Sect disciples didn’t personally engage in operations, as there were fewer than two hundred of them. With such a vast estate, handling everything themselves would hinder their cultivation of the Dao, resulting in a net loss.

However, there were exceptions. A Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) from the Su family oversaw the intercontinental ferry, while a Golden Core disciple from the Yang family was responsible for overseeing the mural city due to the significance of these matters to the Pima Sect’s reputation and interests.

Currently, the Ruined Mountain had begun to take shape, resembling a grand estate. Zhu Lian and Shi Rou acted like the inner and outer stewards, one managing internal affairs on the mountain while the other handled business on Dragon Rider Lane.

It wasn’t until Chen Ping'an had truly left Longquan County that he occasionally recalled and pondered the interesting dynamic between the two stewards—one was a martial artist in the Realm of Wandering and the other was a skeletal female ghost clad in the remnants of a celestial being. Who could have imagined?

Before leaving Ruined Mountain, Chen Ping'an had already informed Zhu Lian that he wouldn’t easily send sword messages back to Ox Horn Mountain. The two flying swords hidden in his small sword mound couldn’t cross continents, so this trip to the Northern Julu Continent was truly a solitary journey, free of attachments.

After all, Ruined Mountain was quite stable now.

It was better to be wary of others.

As Chen Ping'an walked along the road, he adjusted his bamboo hat and chuckled to himself. His enclave should start making some money.

Bone Marsh was a place that did not require the Confucian etiquette. The small market had no official name and was colloquially referred to as "How to Deal With It," a title that had become second nature to the locals.

Even under the bright sun, the streets of the market felt eerie and cool. According to the Pima Sect's version of the book "Rest Assured Collection," this was due to the Yin energy leaking from Ghostly Valley. Therefore, it was advised that weak individuals should stay away. However, this seemingly frightening Yin energy was clearly documented in black and white, having been refined by the Pima Sect's mountain and water formations, rendering it relatively pure and uniform, making it somewhat suitable for cultivators to absorb directly. Thus, any Qi practitioners soaring through the air would notice that not only around the market but along the entire border of Ghostly Valley, there were many practitioners setting up humble abodes for cultivation. Simple yet not shabby straw huts were scattered about, appropriately spaced. These huts had been specially built by Pima Sect disciples skilled in feng shui, constructed over areas thick with Yin energy known as “springs.” Each hut was furnished with a specially made meditation cushion from the Sanlang Temple, allowing cultivators to rent a hut for short-term stays. Wealthier individuals could purchase them outright. The "Rest Assured Collection" listed detailed prices, clearly marked.

This was likely the Pima Sect's way of making a profit.

In the future, Ruined Mountain should learn from this.

Once inside the market, Chen Ping'an leisurely strolled, discovering that almost all the shops sold a type of translucent white bone, a rare post-natal spiritual treasure detailed in the business section of "Rest Assured Collection." It was quite precious, originally born from the remnants of ancient battlefields, where numerous ghosts had gathered, with half having been driven there at great cost by the Pima Sect disciples to prevent them from wreaking havoc on the entire Bone Marsh.

Over time, some of these spectral beings evolved into heroic spirits resembling deities of mountains and rivers as their cultivation levels rose through various coincidences, while many turned into violent ghostly apparitions, running amok. As the years passed, powerful Yin spirits that “fed on ghosts” emerged, leading to fierce entanglements and battles; the defeated would have their souls scattered, transforming into the Yin energy of Ghostly Valley, losing any chance of reincarnation. The varying degrees of bones scattered around became valuable trophies for the victors. Qi practitioners and pure martial artists entering Ghostly Valley had always found these pure white bones to be quite lucrative.

Many merchants from the mountains came here to buy these refined white bones, as they were excellent materials for crafting various Yin artifacts.

Chen Ping'an finally entered the largest shop in the market, which was bustling with visitors. They crowded around a treasure encased in a glass cabinet—the skeletal remains of a city lord from a fallen city in Ghostly Valley, standing one yard tall. Positioned in a seated posture, with clenched fists resting on its knees, it gazed into the distance. Even in death, it held an imposing air of dominance.

The skeleton was covered in natural silver veins, intricately intertwined, shimmering with unpredictable brilliance.

It was said that the owner of this skeleton was once an heroic spirit with a cultivation level equivalent to a Nascent Soul Earth Immortal. Fierce and untamed, he led eight thousand ghostly beings, declaring himself king, engaging in wars with the ruler of Ghostly Valley, who had a cultivation level comparable to the Jade Purity realm. However, the “Rest Assured Collection” did not record the process of this heroic spirit's demise. According to the store’s young attendant, who was speaking animatedly, the shopkeeper had made the acquaintance of a deep-hidden sword immortal from the north, who demonstrated his prowess and, after a visit to Ghostly Valley, gifted this priceless skeleton to the shop, claiming it as payment for some previously owed drinks, leaving without revealing his true name.

In another place, Chen Ping'an would undoubtedly dismiss such an absurd tale, but here in Northern Julu, he found himself half-believing it.

This skeletal remains, seemingly of a celestial being, was undoubtedly a top-tier magical artifact. The shop attendant mentioned that generally, it was not for sale, but if someone truly had intent, they could negotiate. However, he made it clear that without at least forty to fifty Gu Yu coins in hand, it was better not to bother discussing it, to avoid wasting everyone’s breath. Despite such an exorbitant price, Chen Ping'an still noticed several groups in the shop eager to try their luck.

He decided not to join in on this spectacle.

After leaving the shop, he found an inn. The room was not luxurious, but it was clean and refreshing. Similar to the tea stall at the Yao River ferry, it didn’t accept gold or silver; a single snowflake coin would suffice for three days, excluding meals or drinks. If it were in the worldly capital of Da Li, even a small inn the size of a snail shell charging over three hundred taels a day would have long been drowned in spit.

Chen Ping'an removed his bamboo hat and the sword immortal from his back, continuing to read the increasingly concerning “Rest Assured Collection.”

Bone Marsh was one of the ten ancient battlefield sites in Northern Julu Continent, and Ghostly Valley was unique—a vortex of time, creating a small world akin to the nether realm. Its area was no smaller than the Bone Marsh in the "yang realm." Within it, a massive heroic spirit now at the Jade Purity realm had first emerged, rallying tens of thousands of Yin soldiers to construct the renowned White Bone Capital, reminiscent of a royal capital. Surrounding it were dozens of other cities; half were affiliated with the Capital, while the rest were created and run by highly skilled ghostly beings, refusing to be mere vassals. Over a millennium, although the ghostly beings within Ghostly Valley gradually dwindled, they grew increasingly powerful.

Historically, the Yin beings of Ghostly Valley had attempted twice to break free, hoping to ravage the Bone Marsh, ideally sweeping across two countries along the Yao River, capturing living beings to return to Ghostly Valley and using sinister methods to forge new ghostly beings, thus amassing their forces. Fortunately, Pima Sect disciples thwarted these attempts, but it cost them dearly, causing their momentum to plummet from peak to abyss.

The Pima Sect faced numerous challenges in establishing a foothold and expanding in the Northern Julu Continent.

However, the depth of the Northern Julu Continent’s background was evident; even in the Bone Marsh, the Pima Sect had three elders at the Jade Purity realm, while Ghostly Valley had one as well.

Comparatively, in Eastern Bottle Bottle Continent, if one didn’t mention those few secretive high-level hermits infiltrating, the local cultivators at the summit of the five realms were few and far between.

Cui Dongshan had long warned about this, stating that the territory of the Bottle Bottle Continent was less than thirty percent of the Julu Continent, and that Jade Purity realm cultivators were rare, being exceptional exists. However, in the Bottle Bottle Continent, those who reached the upper five realms were no mere trifle; figures like Liu Lao Cheng of Shujian Lake and Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple were extraordinary talents sharing the fortune of the continent. If they were to face cultivators from Northern Julu or Tongye Continent, especially those pampered noble masters, Liu Lao Cheng and Wei Jin would have a significant advantage.

Once Qi practitioners and martial artists choose to enter the valley for training, it was tantamount to signing a life-and-death agreement with the Pima Sect. Wealth or death depended solely on one’s skill and luck. If they struck it rich, the Pima Sect would not be envious and wouldn’t take a single coin; if they died in Ghostly Valley, they would be trapped in a cycle of life and death, and could not blame heaven nor man.

This was an unwritten rule. Throughout history, there had been instances where immortal houses lamented the untimely demise of their proud disciples, leading to disputes with the Pima Sect for compensation. Pima Sect disciples never explained a word. When they arrived at the mountain gate, they simply set a table, offered a cup of gloomy tea, and then began fighting. Either they attacked the ancestral hall or forced the opposing party to relinquish all their treasures and celestial coins, tossing them into the Yao River before returning home.

Thus, the Yao River had another nickname—Dumpling River.

But many had met their demise there.

However, the Pima Sect would not dwell on the deaths of outsiders practicing here. The "Rest Assured Collection" clearly outlined three northern routes, recommending Qi practitioners and martial artists to carefully gauge their own levels. Initially, they should seek out wandering lonely ghosts, then engage with a few less powerful cities, and finally, if they were daring enough and still unsatisfied, venture into the heart of a few cities for luck.

All the levels of the heroic spirits and ghost kings in Ghostly Valley, their expertise in techniques, treasures, and hidden skills were all clearly recorded in the book.

Moreover, the Pima Sect had built two small towns in Ghostly Valley, with the sect leader, Guo Chi, personally stationed in one. However, ordinary people rarely saw her. In the town, there were two groups of Pima Sect inner disciples specializing in hunting Yin spirits, and outsiders could follow or invite them to explore Ghostly Valley. All the spoils would not cost the Pima Sect a single penny. However, the book also stated candidly that Pima Sect disciples would not serve as escorts, and it was entirely normal for them to watch someone die without intervening. However, if disciples from prominent immortal families were to visit Ghostly Valley for leisure, they could do so, as long as they followed the Pima Sect disciples’ instructions throughout the journey. The Pima Sect guaranteed that they could enjoy the sights of Ghostly Valley and leave safely, as long as the visitors adhered to the rules. If any unexpected losses occurred during the trip, Pima Sect disciples would not only compensate but also risk their lives.

As night fell, Chen Ping'an closed the thick volume of "Rest Assured Collection" and moved to the window, leaning against it while sipping his drink.

Having finished the book, aside from memorizing the tedious taboos, he had also glimpsed the Pima Sect disciples' boldness.

Reflecting on the past.

Back then, in the Lihu Cave Heaven, there was a young boy in straw sandals, raising his head high, witnessing a scene he would never forget.

Countless sword cultivators soared across continents on their swords, heading to the Sword Qi Great Wall to resist the demon race.

Seeking profit and fame?

No, they were just honing their swords.

No wonder she said that this cold and harsh land has always produced many heroes.

Only such soil could give rise to the greatest number of sword immortals in the world.

“If you’re willing to offer me a few jars of wine, I’ll gladly return you a pair of heroic spirit bones worth dozens of Gu Yu coins.”

Is it reasonable? Not at all.

Is it unreasonable? Quite the opposite.

Chen Ping'an turned his gaze toward the sword immortal resting on the table and softly said, “Rest assured, I won’t embarrass you here.”

He shifted his gaze slightly to the bamboo hat and smiled, “Because my name is Chen Ping'an, the peace of ‘peaceful and safe.’ I am a swordsman.”

After a moment of silence, he rubbed his chin and murmured, “Would it be more imposing if I omitted ‘peaceful and safe’?”

The mural city encountered an unprecedented strange event.

Pima Sect disciples began sealing off three walls with remaining blessings, forbidding any visitors from approaching. Even the shopkeepers and attendants had to temporarily vacate the premises, waiting for a notice from the Pima Sect.

Naturally, this led to a surge of complaints and curses.

One unfortunate soul, in a fit of anger, shouted profanities just as a passing Pima Sect disciple, without saying a word, knocked him to the ground with a single sweep of his sleeve, rolling his eyes before fainting.

Then, the poor fellow's friend, without uttering a word, picked him up and ran off, offering no apologies to the Pima Sect and not even a retort.

This was how it was in Northern Julu; I have the audacity to curse at others, but if I get knocked down, it’s my own skill that failed me, and I’ll accept it. One day, when my fists are harder than theirs, I’ll seek to regain my honor.

The Golden Core disciple surnamed Yang felt a headache coming on.

His junior brother, Pang Lanxi, was even more helpless.

Underneath one of the murals, a shabby young man knelt and kept bowing his head, blood flowing incessantly, pleading with the rain goddess depicted above for a chance. He had a blood feud that he must avenge, and if the goddess could grant him a portion of divine fortune, he would be willing to serve her as an ox or horse for eternity, even if he had to die immediately after avenging his grudge.

Before bowing, the young man pulled out an ancient jade tablet he’d found from who knows where and placed it gently on the ground.

The middle-aged Golden Core disciple waved his hand, signaling an outer sect disciple not to drive the young man away.

Pang Lanxi wanted to say something to dissuade him but was held back by the middle-aged disciple.

The middle-aged disciple was more focused on the slender woman resembling a willow tree who had just appeared.

When she arrived, the mountain and water formation set by the Pima Sect near the mural remained still, but the natural barriers of the immortal palace’s secret realm began to ripple.

As for the goddess depicted in the mural, she was not flustered at all; an outsider had already gained her recognition, and the Pima Sect allowed it without interference.

The rain goddess returned the favor, voluntarily accompanying the young man as they ascended the mountain together toward the Pima Sect’s ancestral hall.

Thus, the painting of the rain goddess turned into the first outline.

Then, a colorful deer leaped from the painting of the deer-riding goddess, its figure vanishing instantly, becoming the second outline mural of the day.

The Golden Core disciple surnamed Yang was initially shocked. After all, the fortune of the mural depicting the heavenly official was something the Pima Sect had long desired. Everyone at the Pima Sect hoped that his junior brother, Pang Lanxi, could successfully inherit this opportunity. He almost couldn’t restrain himself from trying to stop the colorful deer’s sudden escape, but the sect leader, Guo Chi, quickly emerged from the mural, instructing him to stand down, telling him to guard the last painting of the goddess, and then returned to Ghostly Valley, saying there were distinguished guests arriving who required her personal reception. The visitation of the rain goddess and her new companion had to be left to the elders in the ancestral hall to handle.

The middle-aged disciple was baffled. Was it truly a great sect leader who warranted their sect leader to personally receive them?

The rain goddess finally appeared, her face pale, glancing at the cold-eyed woman and then at the ancient jade tablet on the ground, inscribed with the words “Flowing Clouds” and “Flowing Water.” The goddess, renowned for her expertise in divination, seemed to find herself in a dilemma.

The middle-aged disciple sensed a hint of something amiss.

This was a monumental dilemma that none of the other seven goddesses had ever faced.

The seemingly fragile and gentle woman, if not for her eyes, would have gone unnoticed even standing beneath the mural, even by a Golden Core disciple like him.

It was unimaginable that a goddess could possess such a pitiful and helpless side.

The rain goddess was the one the Pima Sect interacted with the most, said to be the most resourceful among the secret realm goddesses, especially skilled in chess. The ancestor had once jokingly said that if someone could unexpectedly win the favor of the rain goddess, they might not excel in combat, but an immortal household would desperately need her assistance.

The woman glanced at the kneeling young man, whose forehead was nearly bleeding, and looked back at the rain goddess, “You go help him through his troubles, and after a hundred years, come back to apologize to me.”

The rain goddess’s thoughts wavered, causing the entire mural city to seem shrouded in mist. She felt as though she had encountered an official from the court while standing in front of this woman, whose cultivation level was not particularly high.

The rain goddess trembled, “How will I find the master afterward?”

The woman replied indifferently, “Shizi Peak.”

The middle-aged Golden Core disciple furrowed his brow. There was indeed a formidable Nascent Soul on Shizi Peak who should not be underestimated, but he was an elderly male cultivator.

Even if this Nascent Soul was standing right there, how could this rain goddess be so apprehensive?

The woman smiled at the middle-aged Golden Core disciple, introducing herself, “Shizi Peak, Li Liu.”

The middle-aged disciple had never heard this name before but still responded, “Pima Sect, Yang Lin.”

The young woman named Li Liu then left the mural city, seemingly too disinterested to glance back at the rain goddess.

The young Pang Lanxi, standing dumbfounded to the side, wiped the sweat from his forehead, sighing, “Yang Shixiong, that senior Li Liu is quite intimidating.”

The middle-aged disciple chuckled, “You can say that here, but if your master hears it, you might get a lecture about your lack of focus on cultivation.”

The naive young man thought that Yang Shixiong was indeed calm and would definitely become one of the Pima Sect’s pillars in the future, yet he failed to perceive the complex expression in the Golden Core disciple’s eyes.

Because Pang Lanxi was still oblivious, he had already lost the fortune of the deer-riding goddess mural.

In Ghostly Valley.

One of the group did not walk through the entrance archway.

Instead, they broke open a large door with their life-bound item, and a shimmering boat surged into the space.

At the bow stood a young woman clad in a Daoist robe, a lotus crown atop her head, accompanied by the goddess of the colorful deer, alongside Jiang Shangzhen, who had changed her mind to explore Ghostly Valley together.

The celestial boat gifted by the Tianjun Xie Shi was indeed a treasure, but within the dense fog of Ghostly Valley, its speed was considerably slowed.

The shimmering boat cut through the sky of Ghostly Valley like a comet, drawing intense attention. As the vessel brushed against the Yin energy mist, it emitted dazzling colors of seven-colored glass, accompanied by a thunderous sound, causing many ghostly entities to scatter in panic, and cities along the route quickly went on high alert.

Jiang Shangzhen extended her palm to her forehead, gazing into the distance with a smile, “Congratulations, Sect Leader, we’re almost at the White Bone Capital. Is this shimmering boat for sale?”

The young woman in the Daoist robe ignored her.

The deer-riding goddess and her master shared the same sentiment, unwilling to engage with the unfiltered chatterbox.

Suddenly, Jiang Shangzhen turned and asked, “Sect Leader He, if you’re determined to kill him, given the disparity in your realms, I will have to intervene. Of course, before that, if the Capital wishes to bully the two of you, they must ask for my consent.”

The young woman remained silent.

Jiang Shangzhen sighed. In this world, debts of money are easy to settle, but debts of love are difficult to repay.

What exactly had Chen Ping'an done to provoke her?

Young and yet so powerful.

If Chen Ping'an were present, Jiang Shangzhen would definitely give him a thumbs-up, praising him as a role model for their kind.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 563: The First Show of Strength in Greasy City

As dawn broke, Chen Ping'an left the inn and told the young attendant, who was dozing at the counter, that he was checking out.

The young attendant, unconcerned, nodded in acknowledgment. Although the young wanderer with the bamboo hat had checked out two days early, the money wouldn’t end up in his pocket. Feeling a bit demotivated, he instructed a woman who worked at the inn to clean the room, thinking he could deal with it later.

Turning his gaze to the quiet street outside the inn, he realized the young wanderer's figure was already gone. The attendant felt a pang of unhappiness as he recalled the rumors circulating from the mural city, where the opportunities to meet the three celestial maidens had been snatched away by outsiders. He had often gone there for no particular reason, thinking that these celestial beings were likely drawn by the looks and family background of the men. The young attendant felt increasingly dejected, akin to a mouse digging a hole, frustrated to the point of madness.

Chen Ping'an left the market and arrived at the archway marking the entrance to Ghostly Valley, where he paid five Snowflake Coins to the gatekeeper monk of the Pi Ma Sect. He received a jade token inscribed with the words "Mighty Celestial Might, Slaying Ten Thousand Ghosts." If he managed to leave Ghostly Valley alive, he could exchange the token for two Snowflake Coins.

The toll wasn’t expensive—just enough for a dozen bowls of the somber tea from the Shaking River.

Moreover, this celestial money could also be credited to the Pi Ma Sect, which meant that many desperate outlaws from the northern countries would make their way into the Bone Wasteland, intending to do three things: first, offer a few coins at the Shaking River shrine and burn three incense sticks to pray for blessings from the river god; second, try their luck at the mural city where the celestial maidens were depicted; and third, visit the market at the Nai He Pass to buy a copy of "Rest Assured Collection." After passing through the archway, they would entrust their lives to the heavens.

Having paid the fee, he obtained the jade token with the inscription. Most powerful spirits near the southern edges of Ghostly Valley wouldn’t actively provoke anyone carrying the jade token, as the Pi Ma Sect’s master, the immortal Guo Chi, stationed there with two town's worth of monks, frequently hunted spirits. However, the town lords wouldn’t necessarily restrain their wicked spirits from causing trouble. In the early days, many southern lords were dismissive of danger and relished the opportunity to prey on those carrying jade tokens. In response, Master Guo Chi had taken it upon herself to lead a handful of Earth Immortal disciples deep into their territories, even at great personal risk, to behead several culprits as a warning. Her slow progress in reaching the Jade Purity Realm was largely due to these perilous encounters, having lingered too long in the Nascent Soul stage.

On one particularly dangerous occasion, only Master Guo Chi returned, gravely injured, with three severed heads of town lords hanging from her waist. Subsequently, she was imprisoned in the back mountain by the old sect master, who decreed that she could not leave until she reached the fifth realm. When she finally emerged, her first action was to return to Ghostly Valley. Had it not been for the ancestral decree established before the founding elder's passing, forbidding the sect’s successive leaders from activating the celestial weapons bestowed upon them, mobilizing the ten thousand ghost soldiers within, it was likely that, owing to her temperament, Master Guo Chi would have led her forces to strike against the Bone Capital.

At this moment, aside from Chen Ping'an, there were three groups waiting for the hour of the hare to enter Ghostly Valley. Some were friends accompanying him, while others were close attendants, all waiting together.

When it came to entering Ghostly Valley for trials, timing was crucial unless one was gambling with their life.

Various family members or senior sect members had cautioned their youthful juniors to remain extra vigilant once they entered Ghostly Valley. Most of the advice was typical, already detailed in the "Rest Assured Collection."

Chen Ping'an attached the jade token to his waist, standing a little distance away, rubbing his hands together for warmth.

As the hour of the hare arrived, an elder monk from the Pi Ma Sect standing at the center of the first two-colored glazed archway moved aside to clear the path and said auspiciously, “I wish you all smooth sailing and safe travels.”

Chen Ping'an smiled in understanding.

He truly had a good name.

Walking at the back, Chen Ping'an passed one archway after another, each with different designs and inscriptions, broadening his horizons.

This time entering Ghostly Valley, he wore a blue robe called "Green Grass," gifted by Wu Yi from the Purple Yang House, and took out a walnut bracelet given by Liu Zhimiao from Qingxia Island, as well as a stack of yellow talismans he had drawn up the previous night, hiding them in the sleeve of his left arm. The talismans were mostly entry-level lighting and barrier-breaking talismans from the "True Records of Dan Writing," along with three small talismans, one of which was crafted from rare golden material and had consumed a lot of his energy and spirit last night. This talisman could be used both for escape and life-and-death situations, achieving the best effect when combined with the drumbeat method.

The group took a full incense stick's worth of time to walk past twelve archways, flanked by towering armored generals, each over two meters tall, representing the two opposing sides from the ancient battlefield of the Bone Wasteland. This was a conflict that had raged for a decade between two great dynasties and sixteen vassal states, where the two armies slaughtered each other without regard for their legacies. It was said that over ten thousand martial artists traveled from the north to witness the battle.

Chen Ping'an looked back, and the figure of the Pi Ma Sect's gatekeeper had already faded from view. As everyone paused, the surroundings opened up, revealing a vast expanse of sky and earth, but the atmosphere was heavy with a gloomy, oppressive aura. The dense yin energy of this small world poured into various vital points, making it hard to breathe and filling them with a sense of foreboding. The "Rest Assured Collection" elaborated on methods to counteract this.

The three groups of practitioners and pure martial artists ahead were taking their precautions against the invading yin energy.

Among them, a young martial artist clad in mud-gold robes underestimated the intense yin energy of Ghostly Valley and was caught off guard. His face flushed suddenly, and a girl beside him, armed with a knife and bow, quickly handed him a green porcelain bottle. After he drank some of the sweet dew brewed from his own mountain, his complexion returned to normal. The young man, slightly embarrassed, exchanged an apologetic smile with the girl, who started to scan the surroundings, exchanging glances with an old man in black robes standing behind him, who reassured her not to worry.

Ghostly Valley was both an excellent place for trials and a prime opportunity for enemies to send assassins.

The girl and the old man were both attendants.

The woman, around thirty years old, had just reached the sixth realm as a pure martial artist, an exceptional rarity. Although the Northern Julu Continent had a vast martial atmosphere, it was uncommon to find a woman of such young age who had attained the status of a minor master. Generally, only sects and royal families could nurture such outstanding heirs, and they were always fiercely loyal.

As for the old man in black, he was inscrutable, making it impossible to discern whether he was a pure martial artist or a practitioner.

In another group of practitioners, a robust man held a talisman and donned a snow-white battle armor that gleamed, preventing nearby yin energy from approaching him.

An elder practitioner took out a box from his back, producing a faint sound of porcelain clinking. Finally, he removed a jade vase shaped like a woman’s figure, evidently a high-quality spiritual artifact. Once settled in his palm, he noticed the surrounding pure yin energy began to converge into the vase. However, the yin energy of the world came and went swiftly, and in a moment, only a tiny droplet of water, as small as a corn kernel, gathered at the mouth of the vase, suspended in the air without falling.

A middle-aged practitioner flicked his sleeve, conjuring a small green banner resembling a banana leaf in his palm. Grasping the rosewood handle with two fingers, he waved it, transforming it into a banner long enough to extend from his arm. The banner's handle was tied with a golden tassel, which he hung on his wrist. The man silently recited a mantra, and the yin energy washed over the surface of the banana leaf banner, cleansing it like a person washing their face in water. This was the simplest method of refinement; it was merely a matter of taking out the spiritual artifact. Yet, in this vast land, how many places could possess such dense and pure yin energy? Even if such places existed, they had long been claimed by major sects and were strictly guarded, leaving no room for outsiders.

Two practitioners exploring Ghostly Valley shared a knowing smile; the purity of the yin energy inside truly was exceptional, perfect for practitioners skilled in ghostly arts.

It was akin to entering a treasure trove.

Next, it would depend on how much they could take away.

As for the practitioner with the talisman, he was hired with hefty pay to guard them. The innate yin energy nurtured by Ghostly Valley was not only richer than that near the Bone Wasteland, which had already been filtered through the Pi Ma Sect’s formations, but it was also colder and more valuable the closer one got to the heart of the valley. With increasing danger, they might have to fight against malevolent spirits along the way. If successful, they could acquire several bones as a profit; if not, everything would end in utter despair. Practitioners were more aware than ordinary people of the plight of becoming the lost spirits of Ghostly Valley.

Chen Ping'an glanced at them briefly and chose not to watch further.

Sucking in yin energy from the valley was a severe taboo. The Pi Ma Sect clearly warned against this in the "Rest Assured Collection,” as it could easily provoke the ire of local spirits. After all, who would welcome thieves into their home?

However, everyone had their own fates and, if they had the strength and courage, the Pi Ma Sect wouldn’t stop them.

The last two seemed like a young couple of Daoists, each carrying a large wooden box, as if they had come to Ghostly Valley to seek bargains. Aside from yin energy and bones, the valley was also home to many rare flowers, spiritual birds, and beasts. The "Rest Assured Collection" had many records of these, but since the Pi Ma Sect had opened its doors for a thousand years, countless people had come here to seek fortune. The sect's practitioners also had special individuals who constantly searched for various heavenly materials and treasures. Thus, in the last hundred years, very few had been fortunate enough to find anything highly coveted.

Chen Ping'an crouched down, scooping up a handful of soil and gently squeezing it in his palm. It felt remarkably cool, reminiscent of ancient grave soil.

He tossed the dirt aside and picked up a nearby stone that was quite common in the area. Pinching it between his fingers, he frowned slightly—the stone was almost like mud, quite soft.

As expected of Ghostly Valley, the soil here was strange.

The Pi Ma Sect established two towns within Ghostly Valley: one named Lan She and the other Qing Lu. The former was located in the southernmost part, with a scale comparable to the Nai He Pass market, while the latter was situated in a mountain hollow near the valley's center, serving as the semi-practice ground for the female sect master, Zhu Quan. Master Guo Chi had been stationed there for years, and within three hundred years, the lord of the capital had "visited" Qing Lu town twice, each time going alone and clashing with the Earth Immortal practitioners led by Zhu Quan. The battles had been so intense that she had cut down countless nearby mountains with her law sword.

This had also led to the emergence of two northern routes.

The route to Lan She was the safest and shortest, merely eighty li away. However, several places around Lan She were essential to visit, including the long-abandoned ancient tomb with rugged, snow-white peaks, and a city that had chosen to affiliate with the Pi Ma Sect, whose lord was a national master skilled in Daoist talismans and often traded with outside practitioners.

Traveling to Qing Lu Town, however, was a winding journey of over eight hundred li. As for flying with a sword or riding a magical treasure, the "Rest Assured Collection" straightforwardly stated that even if one were a Golden Core Earth Immortal, it would still be a death wish. As for great practitioners of the Nascent Soul stage, unless they were ghost cultivators, entering the yin-heavy and murderous Ghostly Valley held no significance for their training. Moreover, Nascent Soul practitioners were generally unwilling to step into the mortal realm, rarely leaving their own paradises, wasting time and facing the frustration of an old Nascent Soul who had to command a transcontinental ferry, making it an act of desperation. 

Hence, practitioners of the Nascent Soul stage and Ascended Immortals were jokingly referred to as the "Turtle of a Thousand Years" and "Turtle of Ten Thousand Years."

Chen Ping'an chose to head directly to Qing Lu Town and might not even take the "official road" painstakingly opened by the Pi Ma Sect.

The young boy, clearly a disciple from a major mountain clan, along with the ghost cultivators and scattered martial artists, opted to go to Lan She Town. Whether they would risk a trip to Qing Lu Town afterward was uncertain.

What surprised Chen Ping'an was that the young couple, though seemingly low in cultivation, also chose the perilous path to Qing Lu Town.

They were likely Daoist partners from humble backgrounds, whispering softly and supporting each other as they journeyed northward, their expressions filled with a mixture of anticipation and determination.

They were truly gambling their lives for money.

Chen Ping'an quickened his pace, taking the lead to create a significant distance between them, believing it better to walk ahead than to follow them, avoiding any suspicion.

Unintentionally, the duo slowed their pace, often stopping to mold mud, pull grass, or even dig into the earth. 

The distance between them grew larger.

Once the wild cultivators looked up again, the figure of the young wanderer had vanished from sight.

The sky within Ghostly Valley was dim, resembling a gloomy rainy day, somewhat hindering visibility.

Chen Ping'an pressed on faster.

The narrow path leading to Qing Lu Town mostly avoided the towns that had taken root in the southern part of Ghostly Valley. Yet, living people traversing this place of gathered malevolent spirits stood out like fireflies in the night, drawing attention. Many lifeless yet formidable spirits had an acute sense of the yang energy, and a slight noise could easily attract a whole tide of them. To the powerful spirits ruling over these areas, such vigorous spirits were treated like chicken ribs—unwieldy and non-compliant, they might end up in mutual slaughter, exhausting their numbers. Thus, they were allowed to roam the wilderness, serving as the practice targets for the stronger spirits.

Beside a grove where crows perched quietly, Chen Ping'an halted, turning his gaze towards the depths of the forest where figures flickered in white, suddenly appearing and disappearing.

Choosing to leave the path, he entered the grove. The crows took flight, branches shaking as if specters were clawing at him.

However, once inside, aside from some decaying armor and rusty weapons half-buried in the mud, nothing seemed amiss.

Chen Ping'an lightly jumped onto a high branch of a dead tree and surveyed the area, still finding no oddities. But when he suddenly shifted his gaze and focused, he finally spotted a half-white face peeking from behind a tree, blood-red lips forming the shape of a woman. In this lifeless grove, she locked eyes with Chen Ping'an, her rigid gaze resembling that of an observer.

He adjusted his bamboo hat, planning to ignore the lurking spirit, but as he prepared to leap down, he unexpectedly heard the branch beneath him snap without warning. Chen Ping'an stepped aside, looking down to see blood slowly seeping from the break, dripping onto the soil below. 

Then, those rusted armors deep in the ground seemed to be donned by an unseen force, and weapons were pulled from the earth, shakily rising to form a dozen empty "soldiers" surrounding the tall, dead tree where Chen Ping'an stood.

Chen Ping'an jumped down, landing squarely on one of the soldiers’ shoulders. To his surprise, the armor disintegrated into ashes upon contact. He waved his sleeve, sending a gust of wind that turned all the soldiers to dust.

Turning to look back, he saw the white-clad woman still hiding behind the tree, covering her mouth with a delicate laughter, yet no sound escaped.

Chen Ping'an asked with a smile, “Is there a powerful spirit lurking nearby?”

The woman moved stiffly, slowly raising an arm to point at herself.

Chen Ping'an shook his head with a smile, “I meant the kind that can’t be taken down with a single punch.”

The white-clad woman paused momentarily, her expression turning fierce as if worms crawled beneath her pale skin. With one hand, she shaped a blade and sliced through a tree trunk as thick as a well pipe, then with a heavy slap, she charged towards Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an thrust out a hand, the power forming a barrier in front of him. When the shattered wood collided, it turned to powder, filling the air with fragments.

A chill crept around his feet as two white sleeves coiled around his ankles, and a female head emerged from the mud.

No wonder she only showed half her face; while one side was ghastly pale, the other still bore a semblance of femininity. The remaining half was merely a thin layer of skin covering white bones, making her appear like an ugly woman with only half a face. 

Her half-countenance looked pitiable, as if on the verge of tears, trembling as she said, “General, if you hate me for my betrayal, just kill me. Please don’t carve my face; I can’t bear the pain.”

Chen Ping'an allowed her sleeves to wrap around his legs as he looked down, “You must be one of the four trusted ghost generals of the lord of Greasy City, right? Why are you so close to the road? With my Pi Ma Sect jade token, you shouldn’t be here looking for food; aren’t you afraid of encountering trouble with the Pi Ma Sect?”

The white-clad ghost ignored him, tearing at her faceless half-mask with two fingers to reveal the white bones beneath, still marked with cuts from sharp instruments. It was evident that she had suffered extraordinary pain before her death. She wept silently, pointing at the exposed bones on her half-face, “General, it hurts… it really hurts.”

At that moment, Chen Ping'an crouched down, his hands gathered in his sleeves, meeting her gaze, “Enough. Your little tricks won’t work on me. I’ve heard that Greasy City has maintained a good relationship with the Pi Ma Sect, but you have a group of bitter enemies led by a fierce Earth Immortal who specializes in close combat. Though their forces are few, they often cause trouble, like elite scouts from that side. This Golden Core spirit enjoys eating living humans, especially practitioners. Those caught by them endure a fate worse than death, treated like pigs and dogs, having limbs cut off one day and flesh sliced off the next, but not killed. They also know their place and wouldn’t dare offend the powerful spirits of the larger cities, preferring to pick on you Greasy City folks, sneaking off with a woman’s spirit every now and then, which is a dire situation.”

The white-clad ghost remained indifferent, murmuring, “It really hurts… I know I was wrong. General, please be gentle with your blade.”

At that moment, the white mist around Chen Ping'an thickened, as if enveloped by an invisible cocoon.

He felt a slight movement on his shoulder, and a surge of power shattered the mist.

The ghost realized something was amiss and attempted to burrow into the ground to escape, but a swift punch from Chen Ping'an struck her forehead, causing her yin energy to stagnate. He then seized her neck and pulled her out of the earth, tossing her heavily onto the ground. The white-clad ghost curled into a ball like a white mountain snake, her bones shattered, lying limp on the ground.

Chen Ping'an sighed, “If you keep dragging this out, I will really get rough.”

The white-clad ghost cackled, rising gracefully, transforming into an enormous spirit towering three zhang high, her white garments expanding in size.

The "Rest Assured Collection" had briefly introduced this ghost of Greasy City.

She claimed to be Half-Faced Makeup, a former concubine of a distinguished general. After her death, she transformed into a vengeful spirit. Possessing a mysterious magical robe, she excelled in transforming into a beautiful woman, using fog to obscure practitioners' senses, allowing her to slaughter them and siphon their spiritual energy as if drinking wine. She was incredibly hard to kill; once, she had been struck by an Earth Immortal sword while traversing Ghostly Valley but had managed to survive.

Her now-giant figure swayed, her sleeves flowing like rippling river waves. She extended a palm the size of a large mat, sweeping it down her face.

Gazing into Chen Ping'an’s eyes, only one of hers gleamed with a seven-colored glaze.

In an instant, she conjured a face out of thin air.

Chen Ping'an squinted, “You've really sealed your own fate.”

The ghost began to circle around Chen Ping'an, drifting and swaying, her lips unmoving yet emitting a melodious, enchanting tune that lingered around him, provoking distraction, “Can you bear to kill me? Can you really kill me? Why not indulge with me for a while? It would only cost some yang and spiritual energy, and you could fulfill your desires with a woman of your choosing. I gain, and you lose nothing. Why not?”

In the past, whether traversing the treasures of the Baoping Continent or Tongye Continent, or the time he accidentally entered the Lotus Flower Paradise, Chen Ping'an would have carefully hidden his trump cards, gauging his opponent's strength and only exerting as much effort as needed. He had always been cautious, taking every step with care. 

But today was different. Chen Ping'an unsheathed his sword directly, wielding it against the ghost, and with a single stroke, he severed her head from her body. As the two halves parted, her head hung in the air for a moment before plummeting to the ground. Just as it landed, her half-feminine face erupted into a tremendous wail, attempting to react, but Chen Ping'an had already driven his sword through, pinning her down.

With a swift gesture, he grabbed the snow-white robe, compressing it in his palm until it was the size of a handkerchief, light as a feather and rich with spiritual energy, devoid of any malevolent essence. It was a decent magical robe, possibly not inferior to the "Green Grass" robe he was currently wearing.

This ghost posed no significant threat; as Chen Ping'an had remarked, she could be subdued with a single punch. However, the issue was that her true form wasn't present here. No matter how fiercely he fought, he couldn’t harm her essence, making her quite the nuisance. Moreover, in this dense realm of yin energy, a non-corporal ghost could easily use secret techniques to feign death repeatedly, until her "skin" was exhausted of yin energy and severed from her true body, at which point she would quiet down.

The initial flying swords were also the same; they could not yet penetrate the flow of time, disregarding barriers of mountains and rivers. They could not kill in the void by following faint traces.

Only the sword behind him was different.

The Greasy City spirit had come and vanished inexplicably, and not only had her corporeal form dispersed in an instant, but she had also undoubtedly been injured at some point in her true essence. The sword returned to its sheath, silent and still.

Just as Chen Ping'an tucked the exquisite magical robe into his sleeve, he noticed a hunchbacked old woman not far away. She appeared to walk slowly, yet in reality, she was shrinking the distance, stopping just a few steps before Chen Ping'an. The old woman’s expression was dark, “It was merely a harmless probing. Why did you have to be so ruthless? Do you really think Greasy City is an easy target? The city lord is on their way; just wait to meet your end.”

Chen Ping'an looked up, spotting a massive palanquin gliding through the air, flanked by a grand entourage of maidens. Some held canopies to shield the sun, others carried jade tablets to clear the way, and some wielded enormous feathers to dispel the dust, all surrounding this palanquin like stars encircling the moon, making it appear as if an emperor was on a royal tour.

It seemed that the lord of Greasy City had personally arrived.

In Ghostly Valley, the spirits that ruled their territories or the powerful yin entities that occupied the land were far more unruly than the island lords of Shujian Lake. These Greasy City spirits were simply lacking in power, allowing them to commit relatively minor misdeeds. Compared to other cities, their reputation was slightly better.

Chen Ping'an adjusted his bamboo hat, withdrawing his gaze, and looked at the old woman, whose expression fluctuated, “I’m not easily intimidated.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 564: Fist and Sword

The old woman sneered, “You have damaged the foundation of my sisters' cultivation. This debt will be settled. What if you wield a divine weapon? Even a Earth Immortal swordsman cannot escape calamity.” 

Chen Ping'an remained silent. 

Seeing that the city lord's carriage was about to arrive, the old woman began to chant incantations, using her spells to animate the withered trees like living legs, which started to shift and plow the earth. Soon, a large area was cleared. As the carriage descended slowly, two ghostly maidens in green garments, holding ivory jade tablets, landed first. They tossed the tablets aside, and a burst of white light cascaded like spring water, transforming the muddy ground of the dense forest into a pristine white jade plaza, perfectly leveled and immaculate. When the “flowing water” passed by his feet, Chen Ping'an chose not to make contact; instead, he lightly leaped, summoning a half-human-high dry branch nearby with a wave of his hand, and deftly planted it into the ground, standing atop it.

Years ago, while following Mao Xiaodong in the capital of the Great Sui, Mao Xiaodong had specifically explained the power of an array master to him.

The two ghostly maidens exchanged amused glances, surprised to find that the once-feared outsider who had made Lady Bai suffer so greatly was now such a coward. 

The old woman chuckled, “This young master truly has good courage.” 

Chen Ping'an retorted, “You have sharp eyes, old woman.” 

The two beautiful ghostly maidens found it amusing and covered their mouths as they laughed. 

In the haunted valley where demons roamed freely, it was already rare to see living humans, and interesting men from the mortal world were even rarer.

The enormous carriage, resembling a young woman's boudoir, descended gently. Immediately, two ghostly maidens in splendid ceremonial attire gracefully pulled back the curtains. One of them bowed and softly said, “City Lord, we have arrived.”

Chen Ping'an looked up. Inside the carriage sat a girl clad in a phoenix crown and a flowing gown, her makeup excessively heavy, her eyes dazed like a soulless puppet. Her skirt spread out like an enormous lotus leaf, taking up most of the carriage's interior, making her appear comically small, like a budding lotus flower.

The city lord of Skin City was named Fan Yunluo. After her death, she occupied a city, specifically gathering female ghostly beings to manage various affairs within Skin City. She despised men and had proclaimed herself the “Duchess of Powder,” for she was naturally delicate and graceful. Though short in stature, she was said to be proportionate, skilled in poetry and song, and had countless men devoted to her. In life, she had been a princess favored by an emperor, known for her lightness and grace, with a historical tale of dancing in the emperor's palm.

Another ghostly maiden in palace attire, looking somewhat helpless, had to remind her, “City Lord, wake up, we are here.”

The girl jolted awake, shaking her head as if still somewhat dazed. Her eyes gradually cleared, and after yawning and covering her mouth, her hand revealed a wrist like sheep fat jade, adorned with silk gloves that shimmered.

Fan Yunluo looked down at the man standing on the dry branch, “So it is you, this unromantic fellow, who has caused my dear Bai to be gravely injured, forcing her to sleep in the Soul Washing Pool? Do you know she came here under my orders to negotiate a lucrative deal with you? Being so kind-hearted only to be met with retribution.”

Seeing that the young man showed no signs of response, she continued without anger, “By the way, where is that snowflake robe? Where have you hidden it? It was never a token of love given to you by Bai, so why conceal it? Hand it over. It is her cherished possession, as precious as life itself. Without her, she would be heartbroken. We in Skin City kindly sought your cooperation, and your malicious return is something we can set aside for now, but in the haunted valley, we still resort to speaking with our fists. You possess that snowflake robe, which is a testament to your abilities. Name your price, and I will buy it back.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, “In the eyes of City Lord Fan, what is the value of this robe?”

Fan Yunluo replied earnestly, “It should be worth at least three to five Gu Yu coins. Since it is Bai's favorite, to redeem it on her behalf, my word is worth double, so let’s say eight Gu Yu coins.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “Next, will City Lord Fan ask me how much my life is worth, deducting the eight Gu Yu coins from it, and then hand over a large sum of compensation to Skin City after returning the robe?”

Fan Yunluo's eyes brightened, leaning forward with curiosity on her youthful face, “How clever of you! Are you my little worm, knowing what I'm thinking?” 

She shook her sleeves. “Very well. After you compensate, I will certainly offer you a deal that will make you incredibly wealthy, and I assure you will profit immensely.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “What kind of deal?”

She extended both hands with a smile, “Once you hand over the snowflake robe and the Gu Yu coins, we can discuss a deal that will allow your descendants to enjoy wealth for generations.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Why doesn't City Lord Fan look for the disciples of the Pima Sect or other wandering experts for this deal?”

She narrowed her eyes, “Those old-fashioned folks focused on exterminating demons and never covet wealth, looking down on such deals. Ordinary Qi practitioners are too low in rank to support this; it would waste the resources of Skin City. Those too high in rank make profit-sharing difficult, and there’s a chance of being backstabbed. They are a nuisance that disrupts my dreams. Therefore, after Bai and the others searched for over a hundred years, you still seem the most suitable.”

After saying this, Fan Yunluo continued to extend her hands, not retracting them, showing a hint of irritation on her face, “You’re making me hold my arms like this; it’s exhausting, you know?”

Chen Ping'an fell into contemplation.

The southern cities of the haunted valley, including Skin City, had maintained a delicate balance with the Pima Sect. However, communication with the Bone Beach cultivators was exceedingly difficult, leading many city lords to rely on one or more cultivators to act as intermediaries for trade with the outside world. If not, the spectral beings of the haunted valley would inevitably fall into a dire situation. Despite the abundant yin energy in the haunted valley, it was still a fixed quantity; as the realm of a spectral being increased, their vision widened, allowing them to perceive the flow of fortune. The growth of each powerful spirit represented a depletion of other spectral beings, creating a competitive board where territory was fought over, with no possibility of mutual benefit. The northern territories of the haunted valley had been largely engulfed by the Bone Capital, which frequently invaded the south, leading to urgent needs for revenue among the southern city lords.

The Pima Sect guarded the surface exit gates, seemingly surrounding the city but not hindering the southern city lords from cultivating puppets for trade with the outside world. They had their own plans, unwilling for southern forces to become too weak, lest they fulfill the old adage about the strong having good fortune, enabling the Bone Capital to unify the haunted valley.

The old woman glared, “How bold! The city lord is asking you a question, and you dare to daze off?”

She was no different from the ghostly Bai, also one of Fan Yunluo's four trusted ghost generals. In life, she had been a palace tutor and was also a royal attendant. Although she was a Qi practitioner, she was skilled in close combat, which was why Skin City still dared to send her to greet Chen Ping'an after Bai was gravely injured. Otherwise, losing two ghost generals at once would place the small Skin City in a precarious situation, especially with several nearby cities that weren't easy to deal with.

Suddenly, Fan Yunluo raised a hand, signaling the old woman not to rush. 

A trace of caution crossed her face. 

The young wanderer slowly raised his head and removed his bamboo hat. 

The hat vanished into thin air, causing the old woman and the two young maidens in the carriage to tense slightly.

As expected, this fellow carried treasures akin to the Fangcun Shrine and Xiao Wuku.

Chen Ping'an casually stowed the hat away. 

The hat was an ordinary item, merely a suggestion from Wei Bo and Zhu Lian, advising Chen Ping'an to be cautious with his aura while traveling the rivers and lakes. When wearing the hat, he should avoid leaking too much energy to prevent attracting attention, especially in the deep mountains of the Great Marsh, where demons roamed. He needed to be even more vigilant. 

Otherwise, it would be like wandering the lonely graves of the wilderness, not only carrying a lantern at night but also beating drums and sticking talismans on his forehead, leading to small ghosts being frightened off while larger ones would come angrily seeking revenge.

Chen Ping'an had already realized this point while traveling south through the mountains of Shujian. At that time, he was perplexed; the golden literary essence had shattered, and according to logic, that aura of righteousness should have shattered and disappeared as well.

Zeng Ye, Ma Duyi, and the then Gu Can were equally puzzled.

Returning home to the dilapidated bamboo building of Falling Fortune Mountain, as Chen Ping'an's realm ascended and he entered the sixth realm of martial arts, he was actually able to skillfully suppress that aura. However, to be cautious, he continued wearing the hat while traveling the central part of Baoping Continent as a form of self-reflection.

Even without the hat, Chen Ping'an still intentionally suppressed his aura. He smiled and said, “In the past, circumstances forced me to make deals with those who were obviously deadly foes. Now, with you from Skin City, we can't say there’s any deep enmity. So, it seems we should negotiate well; at the very least, we can see if we can strike a deal based on mutual interest. However, I’ve just realized that we can certainly do business. I’m now half of a Bagua Zhai, truly focused on making a profit, but I cannot delay my main business.”

Chen Ping'an took out the snow-white robe resembling a silk scarf and said, “I can return this robe to Skin City. In exchange, you tell me the whereabouts of that Earth Immortal ghost. That’s the deal I’ll make, and everything else can be set aside.”

Fan Yunluo slowly rose, and even while standing in the carriage, she was no taller than the two ghostly maidens below the carriage’s stairs. 

With a stern face, she asked, “After all this chatter, you clearly don’t seem like someone who would dare to go down with the ship. I’ve always hated when others haggle. Since you refuse to cooperate, I will strip you of your soul and leave you in Skin City to light the lanterns. Then we can negotiate again; this is a pain you’ve brought upon yourself. When you have plenty of divine money to earn, you can only scrape by with a meager profit to stay alive.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I’ve learned a lesson.”

Therefore, one must abide by local customs; in this northern region, engaging in verbal sparring is the least effective approach. 

Consider that sage from the academy, who personally intervened and forced three senior cultivators to admit defeat?

Chen Ping'an glanced at the heavens. 

He initially intended to take things step by step, starting with the comparatively weaker Golden Core ghosts. 

But it seemed he needed to adjust his strategy. 

Going solo, battling the entire Skin City offered an invaluable opportunity for experience. 

Moreover, since Skin City was located at the southernmost part of the haunted valley, not far from Lan She Town, Chen Ping'an could fight or retreat at will. 

However, he had already made up his mind—since he was going to fight, he wouldn’t leave any future troubles. 

Even if each retreat was merely to prepare for the next battle with the ghosts of Skin City. 

Otherwise, venturing north alone would mean constantly worrying about rear ambushes, which would truly be a cumbersome situation. 

Additionally, this way, he might even save a golden, material teleportation talisman. 

Earlier, when Chen Ping'an traveled north, he had felt that the yin-yang barrier in the haunted valley was peculiar. If he wielded the Sword Immortal's full strength, he might be able to temporarily carve out a path. However, once he opened the way and exhausted his strength, if he strayed too far from that small door, it would still be difficult to escape. Therefore, Chen Ping'an planned to draw another golden teleportation talisman. With two in hand, even if he strayed far from the barrier between heaven and earth, even if faced with powerful enemies, he would still have a chance to escape the haunted valley and reach the Bone Beach. 

However, this matter could not be rushed; he had to draw the talisman in a secluded place. Otherwise, if the details were leaked, it wouldn't matter if he had two or twenty golden teleportation talismans—all would be useless.

In the haunted valley, there were many Earth Immortal powerhouses, not to mention the City Lord of Bone Capital, who, if wanting to leave the haunted valley, should find it easy. The fear, however, was that the Pima Sect cultivators would occupy the advantageous terrain at Bone Beach, waiting for an opportunity. However, the Pima Sect might actually hope that this Earth Immortal ghost could leave the haunted valley, as it would lead to a leaderless chaos among the demons. The haunted valley had always been rife with intrigue and fierce battles for a thousand years. Once the mainstay was gone, it would become a scattered mess.

Fan Yunluo conveyed through her thoughts to her ghostly subordinates, “Be wary of the sword behind this man; it is very likely a treasure only an Earth Immortal swordsman can possess.” 

Her gaze was fiery, and her palms rubbed together, the light from her gloves surged. This was one of the reasons why she, the “Duchess of Powder,” could establish and maintain her own city in the southern haunted valley.

Fan Yunluo smirked. Capturing this young man would surely yield an extraordinary windfall! The blue robe he wore was already valuable, and the wine flask at his waist might also be a high-grade item hidden by a master. With the sword, this year’s tribute to Bone Capital would not only be secured, but Skin City would also have a considerable surplus. If she could expand her forces by a thousand soldiers, perhaps she wouldn’t have to rely on others for survival.

Ultimately, sending a low-strength ghost like Lady Bai, who was skilled in illusion, to probe was a preparation for both situations. If they encountered a tough nut, they would retreat and engage in slow trade. But if this person possessed treasures and was incapable, then Skin City would be the first to benefit.

In the haunted valley, it was said that not only do they eat people, but even ghosts eat!

Chen Ping'an reached behind his shoulder, “You play nice, and remember to ensure one strike kills. Don’t damage the skeletons; I need those white bones from these female ghosts as capital, and if they shatter, they won’t fetch a good price.” 

Then, Chen Ping'an slapped the sword nurturing gourd. “The same goes for you.” 

A golden thread shot out from behind Chen Ping'an. 

The gourd at his waist also sent forth two streaks of white and emerald light. 

On the white jade plaza, dozens of ghostly maidens from Skin City, who had formed an encirclement, felt a flash of gold pass by. Their eyes burned like they were facing the blazing sun, and in the next moment, they disintegrated into nothingness. 

A beam of light pierced through their foreheads.

Chen Ping'an moved calmly, rolling up his blue sleeves as he lightly leaped down from the dry wood beneath him, striding straight toward the carriage.

Pitying and cherishing the delicate? 

In the ruined ancient temple of the Water Nation, the barefoot youth had once rained down punches upon a female ghost's head, shattering the flamboyant and corpulent ghost into pieces.

In the City God’s Hall of the Rainbow Nation, he had once fought against Shi Rou, who was still a withered ghost then, with remarkable decisiveness.

Back then, in the alley at Yunxia Mountain, Cai Jinjian had also suffered a sudden blow from a piece of porcelain to his neck.

The old woman trembled, seemingly hesitating whether to protect the city lord and resolutely block his path.

Fan Yunluo’s expression turned frosty, but the next moment, she suddenly blossomed like spring flowers, her smile charming as she said, “Sword Immortal, why don’t we sit down and have a good chat? The price is negotiable; after all, it’s all up to you, Sword Immortal.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly exerted force with his feet, cracking the white jade plaza, made from the two ivory tablets wielded by the ghostly maidens, as if shattering porcelain, with fragments scattering in all directions.

Chen Ping'an surged forward, directly charging toward the carriage. 

Two ghostly maidens attempted to block him, but were sent flying by the overwhelming power of his fists.

Fan Yunluo’s complexion changed slightly as she waved her sleeves, her skirt billowing like lotus leaves, occupying most of the carriage’s interior. She giggled, but the malicious intent in her eyes was evident as she coyly said, “Are you afraid? Until next time, if you’re capable, come to Skin City and we’ll have our fun.”

The carriage swayed, tossing her two loyal maidens to the ground.

Chen Ping'an leaped high, extending his hand as the sword immortal responded instinctively, gliding into his grasp. With one sword strike down, the massive carriage performed a nimble roll, narrowly avoiding that blade, then swiftly burrowed underground, producing a muffled sound as it escaped.

Chen Ping'an’s toes touched the coming flying sword, “Chuyi,” elevating him several dozen feet high. Following the sounds beneath the earth, he focused his gaze on a direction, releasing the sword immortal, which shot forth like a crossbow bolt.

The carriage hurriedly altered its trajectory to dodge the sword’s strike. 

This slight delay caused Fan Yunluo's escape speed to slow considerably. 

As Chen Ping'an stepped on “Chuyi” and “Shiwuyi,” he struck the ground repeatedly. 

The earth rumbled like thunder from the underworld in spring. 

A series of radiant treasures flashed underground, accompanied by the frustrated curses of the city lord of Skin City, which gradually faded into the distance, as if the carriage had rushed deeper below.

Chen Ping'an understood that this was the carriage’s secret method of underground escape, which surely had its constraints. The more it “floated” above ground, the faster it would move, but the more obstacles it faced underground. Initially, Fan Yunluo had harbored some luck, but after suffering a significant loss, she could only choose the lesser of two evils, preferring to return to Skin City slowly rather than risk confronting his punches and sword strikes.

The sword immortal, in sync with Chen Ping'an, used the ground to navigate, not rising too high into the air, and then flew toward Skin City. 

As for the flying swords “Chuyi” and “Shiwuyi,” they pursued the carriage underground. 

Regardless, he could not allow Fan Yunluo to easily slip into Skin City.

Moreover, Chen Ping'an also wished to test whether Skin City’s defensive formation could withstand his full-strength sword strike.

At a small hill, Chen Ping'an hovered the sword immortal. 

There stood a skeletal figure dressed in a scholar’s robe, devoid of flesh, with a sword at his waist. 

He smiled and said, “A cornered rabbit will bite. Why do you have to kill Fan Yunluo? She has always bullied the weak and feared the strong, adept at assessing situations. You needn’t worry about her sticking to you. Over the years, her cleverness has backfired more than once; she’s gotten used to being in a bind. Since she’s already frightened, she will only bow down and apologize. Besides, if you really kill Fan Yunluo, you will ruin some agreement established between Zhu Quan and the city lord of Bone Capital, and all the city lords will rise up against you. You’ll be ants gnawing at an elephant; you can only exit the haunted valley. Just a friendly reminder: if you head north, even if you hover close to the ground, you’ll likely be discovered by nearby city lords.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Who are you?”

The skeletal swordsman in a scholar’s robe smiled, “I am merely a gold core ghost in Bone Capital, a city where Fan Yunluo fortuitously helped avert a disaster. But that’s all it is. I advise you to hurry back to Crow Ridge, or you will waste your efforts and let that golden core ghost take all the spoils. Just so you know, the hierarchy of lords and subordinates in the haunted valley is a joke; no one takes it seriously. It’s all about benefits; not even the Emperor himself is recognized. Trust or distrust—it’s up to you.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “So you’re the city lord of Bone Capital.”

The skeletal figure in the scholar’s robe, seemingly comical, didn’t feel absurd in the least. He nodded, smiling, “Pleasure to meet you.”

Chen Ping'an contemplated for a moment. 

With a smile, Chen Ping'an patted the sword nurturing gourd, and the flying swords “Chuyi” and “Shiwuyi” returned to the gourd.

With both hands within his sleeves, he held a golden teleportation talisman in his left hand and the walnut bracelet in his right. “Does the city lord have any further suggestions?”

The formidable spirit from the southern haunted valley shook his head, “None.”

Chen Ping'an steered the sword immortal away, painting an arc as he departed.

The city lord of Bone Capital lightly stomped his foot, “Come out.” 

A carriage rolled out from the foot of the hill. The precious item from Skin City was severely damaged, clearly a testament to the might of that earlier sword and fist.

Fan Yunluo sat inside the carriage, covering her face with her hands, sobbing. At this moment, she truly seemed like an innocent little girl.

The skeletal city lord, dressed in a blue robe and wielding a sword, chuckled, “You, when will you make a deal that doesn’t result in a loss? Have you not thought that a cautious young man, daring to head straight to Qinglu Town, wouldn’t be doing it to seek death?”

Fan Yunluo, tear-streaked, lay in the carriage, sorrowful and crying.

Upon returning to Crow Ridge, Chen Ping'an sighed in relief. 

Except for the old woman who had vanished, the other slain ghostly beings remained, their bones still intact.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 565: The Old Fox of West Mountain's Daughter in Chaos

Having just returned on his flying sword, Chen Ping'an, unlike when he was previously pursuing Fan Yunluo, intentionally ascended a few feet higher. The spectral figure from White Cage City, known as the Golden Core ghost, quickly took the lead and departed.

Chen Ping'an wasn't unwilling to pay some price to attempt to take down the entity in one fell swoop; at the very least, he hoped for a fierce battle. Originally, on his journey to Qinglu Town, this group of spectral beings roaming the southern outskirts of Ghostly Abyss Valley was his primary target. However, the unexpected appearance of Pu Rang, the lord of White Cage City, made Chen Ping'an change his mind. 

The entries in the "Relaxation Collection" regarding this heroic spirit were almost tedious and meticulous, detailing each and every aspect without sparing any ink. When Chen Ping'an first read this book, he nearly thought the author, a disciple of the Pima Sect, was an admirer of Pu Rang. The overly flattering words scattered throughout the text, steeped in a sense of bloodshed, did not sway Chen Ping'an's decision; what truly allowed him to rest easy were four words: Peak Nascent Soul.

Since the opponent had personally shown up and chose not to strike, Chen Ping'an was willing to take a step back. 

Looking around at the ground littered with glistening bones, numbering no less than twenty pairs, slain by the sword immortals and the initial forces, the souls of those ghostly women had long since dissipated, becoming the original Yin energy of this small world. 

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to collect these bones into his spatial pouch, he suddenly furrowed his brows, maneuvering his sword to leave this place. Yet, after a moment of thought, he decided to pause for a moment, gathering most of the bones while leaving behind six or seven that glowed faintly in the forest. Only then did he swiftly fly away from Crow Ridge. 

From a distance, he spotted two figures on the winding path and finally let out a sigh of relief. Still feeling uneasy, he sheathed his sword, adjusted his bamboo hat, and landed quietly in a secluded spot. Standing still on the path, he waited for the couple to approach. The pair noticed Chen Ping'an and, like before, planned to detour off the small path, feigning a search for herbs or minerals to exchange for money. However, upon realizing that the young wanderer had merely removed his hat and did not move, the husband and wife exchanged a helpless glance and had no choice but to steel themselves and return to the road, with the man in front and the woman behind, walking towards Chen Ping'an. 

It was said that fortune can hide from calamity, and calamity cannot be avoided; they silently prayed for the protection of the Three Pure Ones.

As the couple approached, Chen Ping'an held out his hat with one hand and pointed to the dense forest behind him with the other. "Just now at Crow Ridge, I had a fierce battle with a group of vengeful spirits. Although I came out on top, there were many that escaped. I’ve sworn a deadly feud with them, and more battles are inevitable. If you are not afraid of being dragged into my troubles and wish to continue heading north, you must be extra cautious."

The couple exchanged glances, their expressions pale. 

The toll collected at the Archway Pavilion was tolerable, five snowflake coins per person. But for this couple, being rootless floating weeds of the Fifth Realm, not adept in ghostly arts, entering Ghostly Abyss Valley meant an incessant drain on their spiritual energy, making their bodies and minds endure great hardship. They had even specially purchased an expensive healing elixir to help them venture further into the valley, hoping to recover some losses from unexpected gains. Otherwise, if they were just looking for safety, they should have chosen the well-trodden path to Orchid Musk Town.

Anyone who could become a cultivator and step onto the path of longevity was surely not a fool, especially when it came to wild cultivators making money—it would be an understatement to say that they used all their wits and efforts.

The couple's faces were ashen; the young woman tugged at the man's sleeve, "Let it go. If it's meant to be, it will be. It's better to take it slow than to court death."

The man shook his head, taking the woman's hand in his, speaking softly, "You cannot wait any longer. The water will overflow, and the moon will wax; delaying further will only harm you. Good fortune could turn into misfortune."

Releasing her hand, he faced Chen Ping'an, his gaze resolute, and clasped his fists in gratitude, "On the path of cultivation, there are many unforeseen storms. Since our realms are lowly, we can only accept our fate. We cannot blame you, Young Master. My wife and I sincerely thank you for your kind warning."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Is this lady about to step into the Cave Dwelling Realm but, due to her unstable foundation, needs divine coins and magical artifacts to increase her chances of breaking through?"

The woman sighed softly. 

The man nodded, "Young Master has keen insight; it is indeed so."

Chen Ping'an inquired, "May I ask how large the gap is?"

The man replied helplessly, "For us, the number is quite large. Otherwise, we wouldn't have come through Ghostly Abyss Valley. We are truly forcing ourselves to cross the gates of the ghostly realm."

Chen Ping'an tentatively asked, "How much divine money is lacking?"

The man hesitated, his face bitter, "To be frank, my wife and I have traveled through more than a dozen countries over the years, carefully selecting, and finally chose a piece of divine merchandise suitable for my wife's refinement from a shop west of the Bone Marsh. The price was already fair, yet we still need eight hundred snowflake coins. That shopkeeper is kind-hearted and willing to hold onto that item, which has no worries about selling, as long as we can gather the divine coins within five years, we can buy it at any time. We are both scattered cultivators of the Fifth Realm, and over the years have gone through various markets, willing to earn any money we can. Unfortunately, our abilities are lacking, and we are still short five hundred snowflake coins."

The woman felt a deep sorrow within. 

In fact, her husband had more to say, but it was difficult to voice. This time, to enter Ghostly Abyss Valley and earn the five hundred snowflake coins, that elixir meant to replenish energy had already cost over a hundred snowflake coins. 

As the couple journeyed, the money they earned converted to divine coins was not even one snowflake coin. 

The wealth in Ghostly Abyss Valley was not so easily obtained.

They noticed that the young wanderer in the green shirt and sword seemed to be contemplating something, reaching for the crimson wine flask at his waist, likely pondering an idea.

The couple said nothing further, not wanting to give the impression of complaints. In the path of cultivation, for wild cultivators to encounter a higher realm deity and for both parties to coexist peacefully was already a significant fortune; they dared not expect more. Having roamed the world for years, this couple had grown accustomed to the scenes of wild cultivators dying unexpectedly, so much so that even the sorrow of a dying rabbit was lost on them.

When the young wanderer lifted his head, both of them felt a tightness in their hearts.

Chen Ping'an spoke, "I entered Ghostly Abyss Valley for the sake of experience, initially with no intention of seeking wealth, so I did not bring any items to hold things. I never expected to encounter a sudden attack by vengeful spirits at Crow Ridge. Although the aftermath may be endless, I did gain something small. How about this: you two happen to have a big box, why not help me carry those few bones? I estimate they should be able to sell for a few small summer coins. At the Nai He Guan market, you can sell the bones first and wait for me for a month. If I show up, you can take two-tenths of the profit. If I don’t appear, you won’t need to wait for me. Regardless of how many divine coins you earn, they will belong solely to you."

The woman was taken aback, just as she was about to speak, the man tightly grasped her hand, cutting her off. "Young Master, have you considered what would happen if we sold the bones, earned the snowflake coins, and then simply left? Do you not worry?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Since I dare to make this deal, do I still need to worry about not being able to find you two wild cultivators later?"

The man asked again, "Why not leave Ghostly Abyss Valley together? We could simply act as porters for you, earning some honest money—nothing lost. You could sell the bones yourself."

Chen Ping'an frowned, "I have said that my journey into Ghostly Abyss Valley is for cultivation, not for wealth. If you are worried about traps, then let it be."

The man glanced at the distant dense forest and laughed aloud, "Then I will follow you to Crow Ridge. Such a windfall should not be missed; otherwise, it would be a loss against heaven's will. You can rest assured I will wait an entire month at Nai He Guan market!"

Without allowing his wife to refuse, he made her take down the large box, each carrying one, following Chen Ping'an to Crow Ridge.

When he saw those five well-preserved bones, he was left speechless, carefully placing them into the wooden box.

The young man wearing a bamboo hat squatted nearby, flipping through some rusted armor and weapons.

Eventually, as the couple trudged back down the path, each bearing the heavy box, they felt as if they had stepped into a dream, unable to believe their fortune.

The man remained silent for a long while before breaking into a grin, "It feels like a dream."

The woman whispered, "Is there really such good fortune in the world?"

The man turned to look back, but the young man had already vanished from sight, and turning back, he comforted, "High-level beings act unexpectedly; we should consider ourselves fortunate to have met a sword immortal."

The man gradually understood, muttering, "Just think, how many wild cultivators would dare to say, 'I can sell it for a few small summer coins'? Could we ever have spoken so boldly? Even if we were faking it, could we speak so naturally with this young gentleman? I suspect he is definitely a direct disciple from one of those prominent sects. He is certainly not the wild cultivator we initially thought; only someone of such background could act so generously and with such style. And about his threatening words, just listen; it is guaranteed he is a master with a stunning lineage."

The woman pondered for a moment before gently smiling, "Why do I feel that this Young Master may have said those words on purpose for our benefit?"

The man bared his teeth, "How could a cultivator go to such lengths to play the good guy? How strange! Did our sincere prayers at the Yao Yue River shrine finally summon a spirit?"

The woman laughed, "Who can say otherwise?"

Chen Ping'an stood on a high branch, gazing at the couple's departing figures.

His eyes softened, and he did not withdraw his gaze for a long time. Leaning against the tree trunk, he unscrewed the wine flask and said with a laugh, "Is Lord Pu so leisurely? Besides possessing White Cage City, he must also accept tributes from eight cities, including the southern Funi City. If 'Relaxation Collection' is not mistaken, this year just happens to be the day for collecting tributes every sixty years. He ought to be quite busy."

The spectral figure of Pu Rang stood not far off, smiling, "A kind-hearted disposition cannot survive long in Ghostly Abyss Valley."

Chen Ping'an asked, "I understand now; you are curious as to why, despite not being a sword cultivator, I can skillfully wield the sword behind me. You want to see how much spiritual energy I have exhausted in my life source?"

Pu Rang nodded, "I’m somewhat disappointed; the spiritual energy has not been much depleted. It seems an artifact of half-immortal quality, no doubt."

Chen Ping'an queried, "With my meager realm, how could I possess such a fine sword? Are you really not moved, Lord Pu?"

For the white cage city's lord, there seemed to be no trace of murderous intent.

Murderous intent is easy to conceal, but difficult to suppress. 

The true name of Pu Rang, the Golden Core spirit of White Cage City, was one of the few Qi practitioners who had thrown themselves into the battlefield during the turbulent wars of various nations, ultimately perishing in a siege by numerous local earth deities of various countries. Pu Rang had not lacked opportunities to flee, yet for some reason, he had exhausted himself without retreat. The "Relaxation Collection" offered no answers regarding this matter, though the author took the liberty to write a few asides, "I once entrusted Master Zhu to inquire with Pu Rang in person during his visit to White Cage City, asking why a promising Nascent Soul wild cultivator sought death on the battlefield, yet Pu Rang ignored him. It remains a regretful unanswered mystery a thousand years later."

These were certainly flattering words. 

However, the ill words concerning Pu Rang were not few either. 

For instance, Pu Rang's actions were domineering and unreasonable, with sword cultivators coming to Ghostly Abyss Valley for experience having nearly half of them killed by him. Among them were many promising young disciples from the most prestigious sects in Northern Julu Prefecture. For this reason, a powerful sect with a sword immortal even personally journeyed down to the Bone Marsh to confront Pu Rang, leading to mutual destruction. The jade-purity realm sword immortal almost fell into a lower realm during the confrontation, and while breaking through the sky's barrier with his flying sword, he was treacherously ambushed by the lord of Jingguan City, nearly dying on the spot. That sword immortal's treasured protective artifact had been destroyed, leading to immense losses. If Pu Rang hadn't taken the opportunity to beat a retreat, Ghostly Abyss Valley might have seen an unprecedented emergence of a top-tier sword immortal spirit.

Moreover, Pu Rang had actively engaged in multiple duels with two masters of the Pima Sect, causing Zhu Quan's cultivation level to decline, thus delaying his ascension to the jade-purity realm. Pu Rang was the number one contributor of Ghostly Abyss Valley.

Of course, after those deadly battles, Pu Rang himself had completely severed his chances of ascending to the jade-purity realm, suffering even more significant losses.

At this moment, Pu Rang glanced at the long sword behind Chen Ping'an, "A swordsman?"

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Pu Rang asked, "Then why the question? Is it only allowed for the living to be swordsmen? Are the dead not given a chance?"

Chen Ping'an first appeared confused, then quickly relaxed, bowing in respect.

Pu Rang smirked as he motioned towards the bones, treating it as a smile of understanding, then his figure vanished.

After leaving Crow Ridge, Chen Ping'an continued north along the official road of Ghostly Abyss Valley. However, he took every opportunity to explore any small paths branching off the road until they came to an end, which could lead to a hidden gorge amidst lofty mountains, or perhaps a steep cliff. True to its name, Ghostly Abyss Valley was full of mysteries. 

At the edge of a mountain stream, Chen Ping'an noticed creatures lurking at the bottom, quietly cultivating their spiritual essence. However, when he crouched by the riverbank to splash water on his face, the concealed creatures remained patient, not daring to emerge for a surprise attack. Since they were cautious, Chen Ping'an also chose not to take the initiative.

As for the opposing cliff, there hung an iron chain bridge, the wooden planks long decayed, leaving only the iron chains swaying gently in the wind. For Qi practitioners and pure martial artists, traversing this was not difficult, yet Chen Ping'an could see that in the middle of the chain bridge, a large black python, as thick as a pillar, coiled lazily, flicking its tongue. Not too far from the python stood a wide spider web, designed to catch birds flying between the mountains, and the spider had already transformed its head into the visage of a woman, merely the size of a fist.

If a Taoist or monk were to pass by and witness this, they might feel compelled to exorcise the demons and accumulate virtue.

However, for Chen Ping'an, even if these demons wanted to eat a person and create havoc, someone would have to stumble upon them first.

This time, he ventured down a side path into the deep forest and unexpectedly encountered a dilapidated building resembling a small pavilion at the foot of a great mountain. The book did not document it, but Chen Ping'an planned to rest for a moment before climbing further. The small temple was unnamed, but the mountain was well-known. The "Relaxation Collection" mentioned that this mountain was called Mirror Mountain, with a stream at its midsection, said to be where an ancient immortal, wandering the seas, accidentally dropped a precious treasure—an illuminating mirror—when encountering thunder and lightning. The stream was formed from that mirror's fall.

Disciples of the Pima Sect speculated that this ancient treasure was likely a remarkable magical artifact, yet concealed incredible fortunes.

Chen Ping'an wanted to take a look; after all, in Ghostly Abyss Valley, the concept of detours was irrelevant. In the past, he had been very resigned when it came to opportunities, believing that good fortune would never come knocking at his door. However, he had changed considerably; yet, opportunities like the mural of the goddess in the city were still off-limits. As for the rest—abandoned treasures of secret realms and naturally occurring materials—he was keen to test his luck.

After lighting a bonfire in the broken temple, the flames flickered with a faint green glow, resembling the ghost fire between tombs.

As he was munching on his rations, Chen Ping'an noticed a small, elderly man with a wooden staff approaching, a gourd hanging from it. Chen Ping'an continued eating without greeting him.

The old man stood at the temple’s entrance and asked with a smile, "Young Master, are you planning to go to the deep stream at Mirror Mountain?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Indeed."

The old man sighed, "Young Master, I do not mean to alarm you, but that place is extremely perilous. Though it is called a stream, it is actually steep and wide, as large as a lake. The water is clear enough to see the bottom; it seems true that the clearer the water, the fewer the fish. There are no fish in that stream, and birds, snakes, and other beasts do not dare come to drink. Often, birds fly into the stream and meet their demise. Over time, it has earned the name Soul-Trapping Stream. The bones at the lake's bottom are numerous, and besides the birds and beasts, many cultivators who did not heed warnings have also perished there, their accomplishments wasted in the waters."

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "Then, may I ask, old sir, do you wish for me to go see the lake, or would you rather I turn back?"

"What do you mean by that?" 

The old man looked puzzled, "Naturally, I wish for you not to take risks for the sake of sight-seeing. Since you are a cultivator, you have seen all kinds of magnificent scenery; why take risks for a stream? For a thousand years, not only have the disciples of the Pima Sect failed to uncover the mystery, but countless earth immortals who entered this mountain have failed to seize any opportunities. You look like you come from a wealthy family; why risk your life for fortune here in Ghostly Abyss Valley?"

Chen Ping'an glanced at the old man’s staff, which had a few green sprouts growing on it, and asked, "Are you the local land god of this place?"

The old man, holding his staff with one hand and stroking his beard with the other, smiled, "In the mountains of Ghostly Abyss Valley, there is no title of land god, but there is indeed a land deity. I just happened to step in here by chance; I’m merely a minor land deity of Mirror Mountain, a mere speck of light, while those high-ranking spirits in grand cities are like the sun and moon."

Chen Ping'an inquired, "If I may ask, what is your true form, old sir?"

The old man huffed and puffed, "You young ones really don’t understand manners. Even in the market, a monk does not reveal his name, nor does he speak of his longevity. As a cultivator, when meeting a deity, how can you ask about the past? I see you are definitely not someone of noble lineage; are you just a wild cultivator who cannot survive outside and thus come to Ghostly Abyss Valley to seek fortune? If you die, so be it; if not, then you may prosper?"

The old man shook his head and turned to leave, "It looks like there will soon be another corpse at the bottom of the stream."

The gourd hanging from his staff looked as if it had just been plucked from the vine, gleaming green.

Chen Ping'an extended his hand to warm himself by the fire, smiling.

The old man, claiming to be the land god of Mirror Mountain, had tricks and illusions that seemed very transparent and unworthy of mention.

However, despite his efforts with the staff sprouting new buds and the fragrant green gourd, the fox-like demeanor of the old man was still not well-concealed. In the vast world of righteousness, fox spirits could not become mountain deities, and that was an ironclad rule.

Chen Ping'an speculated that this old fox’s true identity was likely the river lord deity of the stream, hoping that someone would accidentally fall into the lake and die while also fearing that if he took the opportunity to retrieve that precious mirror, it would undermine his own foundation. Thus, he had come to confirm things himself. Of course, the old fox could also be a flunky or assistant to a mountain deity of Mirror Mountain. However, there were few records regarding the deities of Ghostly Abyss Valley, only mentioning that they were scarce, and typically only the spirits of city lords counted as half. Other high mountains and rivers were filled with self-proclaimed spirits, lacking legitimacy.

Chen Ping'an was just savoring his drink when he saw the old fox return to the temple entrance, looking quite embarrassed, "Surely, Young Master has seen through my true identity; this little trick of mine is laughable. Indeed, I am the Old Fox of West Mountain. There are no land or river deities here at Mirror Mountain. I grew up and cultivated in the vicinity of Mirror Mountain, relying on the spiritual energy of that stream. However, I have a daughter who, upon attaining her human form, vowed that whoever could retrieve a golden hairpin she accidentally dropped in the stream during her youth would have her hand in marriage."

The old man sighed, "I have waited for several hundred years for this. My daughter is extraordinarily beautiful, yet I have turned down countless suitors from nearby spirits. It has caused many grievances. If this continues, I will not be able to stay in the area around Mirror Mountain. Therefore, upon seeing a young gentleman of fine appearance, I thought, if you could retrieve the hairpin, it would alleviate this great burden of mine. As for whether you take my daughter with you after retrieving the hairpin when you leave Ghostly Abyss Valley, I cannot dictate. Whether you treat her as a concubine or a maid, we of the West Mountain fox clan have never cared for such mundane customs."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "I don't care what schemes you have; don't come closer again. How many times have you overstepped?"

The old man tentatively asked, "Did I say too much regarding the hairpin?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "What do you think?"

The old man pounded his chest and stomped his foot in frustration, turning away. Suddenly, he stopped and turned his head, fuming, "Why are you outsiders so deceitful? Could it be that outside Ghostly Abyss Valley, it’s a den of frauds?"

Chen Ping'an was left speechless, chuckling at the absurdity. 

The old man glanced at the rations in Chen Ping'an's hands and began to curse, "You’re just a poor wretch! You have no money, no looks; how could my daughter ever look at you? Hurry up and get lost, you worthless thing! How dare you come to Mirror Mountain to seek treasures…"

Chen Ping'an raised his remaining rations with a smile, "Wait until I finish eating, then we can settle this."

The Old Fox of West Mountain quickly fled into the distance. 

After finishing his rations and taking a moment to rest, Chen Ping'an extinguished the bonfire, sighed, picked up a piece of unburnt firewood, and stepped out of the dilapidated temple. In the distance, a woman dressed in red and green approached, her bony figure making it apparent. Chen Ping'an instantly recognized her true identity as the old fox, not knowing where she had hidden her staff and gourd. He no longer felt polite, tossing the piece of firewood directly at her. It struck the old fox’s forehead, sending her flying backward, twitching a couple of times before passing out. She would not regain consciousness for some time.

Finally enjoying a moment of peace, Chen Ping'an slowly climbed the mountain towards the stream. He paused, surprised to see her back again. Was she still haunting him?

Without further thought, he grabbed a stone, gauged its weight, and threw it with a bit more force than before, having previously held back at the temple. 

By the stream, a woman was sitting with her back to Chen Ping'an, cross-legged on a pure white rock, a pair of embroidered shoes neatly beside her. She leaned against a green parasol, gently twisting the handle.

If it weren't for the earlier unpleasant scene, Chen Ping'an certainly would not have acted immediately.

As it was, the stone he threw pierced through the green parasol and struck her head with a thud, causing her to collapse onto the ground.

Chen Ping'an had some principles; he did not aim for the back of her head directly. Otherwise, she would have fallen straight into this strange stream. Instead, he only knocked her sideways, causing her to faint but not roll into the water.

Chen Ping'an chose to ignore the West Mountain old fox.

Taking a deep breath, he carefully approached the water's edge and gazed down. The stream was indeed steep yet crystal clear, with numerous white bones visible on the bottom. A few faint glimmers were likely spiritual treasures carried by Qi practitioners, eroded over centuries by the flowing water, leaving only a trace of light. He estimated that even a magical artifact today might not be worth more than a spiritual item.

Feeling a spark of hope, Chen Ping'an wanted to follow those glimmers to see if there were any items of the Water Element among them. If they had fallen into this stream, their quality could possibly be refined further.

However, he remained cautious of this Soul-Trapping Stream, as living beings were prone to jumping into it to end their lives.

Suddenly, he turned his head, seeing the little old man with the wooden staff and hanging gourd racing towards the water, wailing about his unfortunate daughter, lamenting that she was still unmarried and had met her end here.

Chen Ping'an felt a headache coming on.

He raised his gaze to the snow-white cliffs across the stream, where a ragged man sat, stretching lazily. He then swaggered over to the water's edge, plopping down with both feet in the water, laughing heartily, "White clouds rise above, I wear a high crown, I don my robe in the green mountains, with green waters as my shoes. I am not a deity; who is?"

The West Mountain old fox suddenly raised his voice, angrily shouting, "You broke, pants-wearing bastard! You’re still here spewing your nonsense! Didn’t you always claim you wanted to be my son-in-law? Now my daughter has been harmed by a villain; what’s your explanation?"

The man leaned forward, hands submerged in the water, glancing at Chen Ping'an before turning back to the old fox and laughing, "Don’t worry; your daughter just fainted. This person’s strike was far too gentle; it left me no face to play the hero. Otherwise, you’d really have another son-in-law. Who knows, even Pu Rang might want to invite you over to be a guest at Jingguan City."

The old fox, nearly moved to tears, trembled as he said, "You scared me! If my daughter were gone, how would I ever get a son-in-law?"

The young woman, smiling slightly, had long since grown accustomed to her father's plans. Moreover, mountain spirits and specters differed greatly from the customs of the mundane world.

Chen Ping'an turned to the old fox and said, "I apologize, young lady." 

The young woman turned her head, appearing shy and timid, not daring to meet anyone's gaze. She even covered half her face with one hand while picking up the now-damaged green parasol, finally easing her breath.

The old fox shoved the troublesome green parasol aside, stretching his neck to call out to the young man in the bamboo hat, "Just saying 'I’m sorry' is enough? My daughter’s stunning beauty is worth a fortune; losing even a single strand of her hair is a huge loss. How much more so from such a heavy blow? Compensation! At least five… no, it must be ten snowflake coins!"

Chen Ping'an lightly tossed out ten snowflake coins, but his gaze remained fixed on the man across the stream.

The West Mountain old fox caught the handful of snowflake coins, holding them in his hands, lowering his head to look, his expression complex.

The man across the stream, still splashing water on his face, raised his head and laughed, "What are you looking at? I have no intention of harming you."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "That’s good to hear."

The man pointed at the young woman holding the green parasol, saying to Chen Ping'an, "But if you compete with me for her, that’s another story."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, too lazy to respond.

Just then, a voice as delicate as a mosquito emerged from behind the green parasol, "May I ask your name, Young Master? Why did you knock me out with a stone? Did you happen to see the golden hairpin at the bottom of the water?"

The West Mountain old fox suddenly shouted, "Two poor fools! Whoever has money shall be my son-in-law!"

Chen Ping'an pretended not to hear.

The man leaned back, sitting at the water's edge, resting his chin on his hand, his gaze wavering between the green parasol and the bamboo hat.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 566: A Thousand Mountains and Rivers, One Bright Moon

The man who had been sleeping soundly in the hollow of the cliff casually shook his sleeve, and the mountain stream shimmered like a scattering of snow-white pearls as they splashed into the water. He laughed and asked, “Young sir, now that things have come to this, what do you propose?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I don’t have much money; I won’t compete with you.”

The man’s expression brightened, and he nodded, “Then I owe you a favor.”

However, the old fox from West Mountain was displeased. He thumped his wooden staff heavily on the ground and then extended two fingers, pointing at both Chen Ping'an and the ragged man. “I’ve said it before, whoever has money gets to be my son-in-law—there’s no room for sentiment here! You, young man with the bamboo hat, have been generous, and I’ve tested your character several times, giving you a pass each time. Now, we’re almost at the point of making it official. You should cherish this opportunity!”

“If my daughter were to marry you, she’d never have to worry about food or clothing, adorned in gold and silver. She might even outshine those ladies under the likes of Fan Yunlu in Gluttonous City. As for that beggar, having survived on nothing but the wind from the northwest for months—who knows his worth? I can see through him clearly. My daughter was born to enjoy a life of comfort; I absolutely won’t watch my precious girl jump into the fire!”

Chen Ping'an found his horizons broadened. In his travels over the years, he had seen mountain gods marry, fox spirits seduce scholars, and even city gods take concubines, but he had never encountered such a reckless marriage arrangement.

The unremarkable ragged man sighed helplessly, “Old sir, I have no money on me, not even a single snowflake coin; I’m no fool to deceive you. However, before I arrived at this Ghost Valley, I did conduct a significant business deal. I was forced to sell a weapons depot nearby, along with the divine coins and various magical artifacts inside for a paltry sum. I’m not actually poor.”

The old fox became furious, pounding the ground with his staff multiple times, his voice hoarse and strained. “Another attempt to trick me! Get the hell out of here! My eyes see only money!”

Chen Ping'an pulled out a handful of divine coins. “This is all I have.”

The West Mountain old fox, looking weary, said, “You speak in circles, obscuring the truth. I can’t gauge your honesty, but that’s better than that beggar. You’re the son-in-law! From now on, the expansion of our West Mountain fox clan relies on you. While you’re still young and strong, you must put in some effort. Oh, my daughter’s name is Wei Taizhen. She has a younger brother, Wei Gaowu, who’s useless. Once you’re family, remember to look after him. In the future, if we leave Ghost Valley, help him marry seventeen or eighteen fairy ladies…”

But Chen Ping'an reached out toward the ragged man.

The man smiled knowingly, “I could borrow these divine coins, but it would be even better if you gifted them to me. That way, I’d have money.”

The old fox’s eyes darted around suspiciously. Could it be that the beggar had summoned a partner to con him out of his daughter?

A girl hiding behind a small green umbrella timidly asked, “Young sir, just one question: have you seen a golden hairpin at the bottom of the water?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head honestly. “I haven’t seen it.”

The girl sighed softly, slowly rising. Her figure was graceful, but she kept her face hidden beneath the green umbrella, which, like its owner, was charming yet had a small hole that detracted from its beauty. Her voice was cool and distant, yet it carried a natural charm, perhaps the innate allure of a fox spirit. “Please don’t blame my father; just take it as a joke.”

She tugged at the old fox’s sleeve gently. “Father, let’s go.”

The old man shot a fierce look at the young man with the bamboo hat, growing more convinced he was a con artist. With a cold grunt, he said, “Marriage isn’t a trivial matter; we’ll discuss it later.”

The West Mountain old fox and the girl hurriedly left.

As they departed, the gourd hanging from the old man’s staff swayed back and forth.

Once the two fox spirits were gone, the stream returned to silence.

The birds had vanished; the mountains and waters were tranquil, yet an unsettling stillness filled the air.

Chen Ping'an pocketed the divine coins.

The ragged man chuckled, “I owe you half a favor, Yang Chongxuan.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “No need for such formality. I just thought it better to avoid trouble.”

The man said no more, probably too hungry to continue, and found a relatively flat stone cliff to lie down and daydream.

Chen Ping'an removed his bamboo hat, gazing at the flickering lights in the stream below, reminiscent of fireflies in a summer night.

Since he had come to Mirror Mountain, he had indeed come in search of opportunities and magical artifacts. Although his hopes were not high, he understood that fortune often favored the bold. There were certainly rare moments when luck fell into one’s lap, but they were few and far between. More often, it was a matter of effort, like swallows collecting mud or ants moving their homes. When encountering genuine cultivation opportunities, one must also be wary of the dangers that accompany them; sometimes, it could even be a life-or-death gamble.

Just like the couple who should now be at the marketplace in the Underworld City, they had searched and toiled until reaching Crow Ridge, yet had earned not a single snowflake coin.

If they continued north towards Qinglu Town, they might fall together, fulfilling their roles as doomed companions.

As for the name “Yang Chongxuan,” Chen Ping'an turned it over in his mind, finding no memory associated with it. There was no record of it in the “Trustworthy Collection,” so he noted it down for now.

He didn’t think he was dealing with a local spirit lord or a powerful ghost that didn’t heed commands in White Cage City.

Presumably, he was a unique individual here for training.

As for his cultivation, it shouldn’t be underestimated.

Because Chen Ping'an could not see through his depth or foundation.

Like the black-robed elder who had passed through the archway earlier, his divine aura was restrained, and his true spirit hidden deep; Chen Ping'an had still guessed that he was at least a Golden Core level earth immortal swordsman.

Of course, it was also possible that Yang Chongxuan was merely a pseudonym.

Chen Ping'an’s apprehension towards Pu Rang in White Cage City stemmed largely from the latter's high cultivation.

Yet, for some reason, Yang Chongxuan gave him an even stronger sense of danger.

This wasn’t simply because Yang Chongxuan’s realm surpassed that of Pu Rang at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.

Even if Chen Ping'an couldn’t see through this person, he could vaguely sense that Yang Chongxuan, compared to Pu Rang, who seemed to merge with the heavens and earth, lacked that “certain something.” In the path of cultivation, that little discrepancy often represented a chasm.

The man claiming to be Yang Chongxuan reclined on the white stone cliff opposite, crossing his legs, and said with a smile, “If you’ve come for the greatest opportunity at Mirror Mountain, I advise you to give up. Searching for treasures in the water is also something to approach with caution. The longer you look, the more your soul will suddenly tremble at some moment, making it hard to control yourself. Your spirit may leave your body, flowing away like water in the stream, and becoming increasingly difficult to retrieve. During this process, those below the earth immortal realm will remain completely unaware. Sharing these secrets of Mirror Mountain that silently devours souls, I consider the half favor I owe you repaid.”

This stream was born from the plummet of the Mirror, and the stories in the “Trustworthy Collection” that warned against it were not from those ancient figures who dealt with the dead and ghostly artifacts out of fear of outsiders snatching opportunities. Rather, it was that this thing was hard to find; ordinary cultivators searching for treasures in the mountain could easily meet the same fate as the birds, beasts, and skeletons at the bottom, becoming part of the essence of the mountain and waters. Not only that, but half of the souls of earth immortals would be trapped in the water, unable to escape, while the other half, after reincarnation, would find their souls incomplete, which was a grave taboo for qi practitioners.

“As for why I can cultivate here, naturally, I came prepared.”

Yang Chongxuan spoke half-heartedly, suspecting that saying too much would only arouse suspicion from the other. He lazily wiggled a leg and added, “I’m a person of fickle temperament; I like to learn a bit of everything, but I’m not particularly proficient in any one thing.”

Hearing this, Chen Ping'an withdrew his gaze and put his bamboo hat back on.

He decided to leave Mirror Mountain once and for all.

The natural treasures and extraordinary plants of the immortal mountain’s secret realm were obtained through proper methods; both timing and location, along with human factors, were essential. 

What kind of person was in what place, at what seasonal hour, using what methods and carrying what magical treasures—all were interconnected.

A high realm alone was not enough to determine everything.

As recorded in the “Trustworthy Collection,” the lord of Spirit Hall City was intent on acquiring the opportunities at Mirror Mountain. However, despite spending a hundred years, he still could not unravel the mystery, leading him to mobilize his forces. In addition to the ghostly beings in his own city, he borrowed over a thousand from three nearby allied cities and recruited a group of talisman warriors from White Cage City, attempting to uproot Mirror Mountain and move the entire peak to Spirit Hall City. Yet, after countless efforts, it ended up being a fruitless endeavor.

This elusive fortune of Mirror Mountain was evident.

To catch a glimpse of the mural of the heavenly official and goddess, it seemed like one could only rely on fate.

As for taking away that precious mirror, it was still unknown what it truly relied upon; neither the Pima Sect nor Ghost Valley had any idea.

However, Chen Ping'an soon changed his mind. It was worth a shot after all.

Some deeply ingrained old notions needed to be adjusted.

He couldn’t always feel like he was incapable of seizing additional opportunities.

The West Mountain old fox walked down from Mirror Mountain, one hand holding his staff and the other twisting his beard, sighing all the way.

The girl seemed a bit distracted.

Suddenly, the old man asked, “Taizhen, why not marry the ghost general from Sand City? That ghost is at least the top general under the lord of Sand City—far from ordinary. Compared to those gruesome creatures with blood-drenched mouths or emaciated skeletons, he’s relatively presentable. In our area, he could even be considered a handsome young man.”

The girl frowned.

The old man sighed helplessly. “Yes, the wandering Daoist did say years ago that your destined husband must be someone who can see the golden hairpin in the deep stream. But how many years has it been? Two hundred years? Three hundred years? At your age in the markets outside Ghost Valley, your grandchildren should already be marrying and having children…”

The girl, feeling bored, gently twisted the small green umbrella that had a hole, turning her gaze towards the halfway up Mirror Mountain and murmured, “Father, please don’t rush me. Let’s wait a bit longer. At most, a hundred years. If I still haven’t found someone by then, I’ll just marry whoever comes along.”

The old man sighed, “Then you must marry someone wealthy, preferably not too cunning. He needs to be kind, knowing how to treat your father well. Besides a generous betrothal gift, he should occasionally show respect to me, and once you’re married, you mustn’t become like spilled water. My remaining days depend on you and your future husband!”

The girl hesitated for a moment before suddenly asking, “Father, if what that ghost general from Sand City said is true, and if I marry him, the lord of Sand City could help you build a temple on Mirror Mountain and become a water deity receiving incense offerings?”

The old man snickered, “You can’t trust a word he says, let alone this kind of ghost talk. Do you have any idea how precious the spirits of the mountains and waters in Ghost Valley are? Among so many lords and gentlemen in the north and south, how many are there? Although we can’t even dare to hope for becoming a mountain god, let alone a golden body, following the teachings of Confucian saints, who would dare to defy them? But a local water deity has some standing, but alas, I know my own limits. With what little I learned from my fragmented scriptures, secretly sipping from the waters of Mirror Mountain, slowly increasing my cultivation has been the extent of it.”

The girl smiled, “Father, are you afraid of the suffering that comes with becoming a deity, like ‘the body dissolving while the soul is fried’?”

The old man was thick-skinned, “Of course! Whether you’re alive or dead, or even us mountain spirits, we all seek a life of comfort. Why is it easier for spirits of the national heroes to become gods? It’s because they are shielded by the national fortune and possess merits. Why is it dangerous for spirits and ghosts to become gods? Isn’t it because they stray too far from the mundane world, unable to accumulate enough virtue and are in debt to the heavens? In this Ghost Valley, I’ve only seen a few living people over my lifetime. What virtue can I possibly accumulate? Moreover, every time I see one, I’ve harmed them, tricking poor qi practitioners into the stream to watch water, causing them to lose their souls. For all these hundreds of years, every Qingming Festival, I circle Mirror Mountain again and again, time and again offering soil and incense. Do you think it’s a joke? It’s my guilt.”

The old man stomped his foot in frustration, “Why don’t those lords find you attractive? If not for becoming a phoenix from a sparrow, even as a favored concubine to one of those lords, your useless brother and I could have lived better lives! Why do we have to stay here at this desolate Mirror Mountain, twiddling our thumbs and waiting for death? Just look at that lecher from Powdered Boy City, who was once shouting about marrying you in a grand procession—why has he suddenly lost interest after all these years?”

The girl appeared somewhat innocent.

Can one force others to like oneself?

She had a pair of very beautiful eyes.

The old fox sighed, the West Mountain fox clan was gradually dwindling, with few remaining. 

He had heard that there was a place in Baoping Continent where the fox clan flourished, but the old fox firmly believed that even if his daughter went there, she would still be a stunning beauty.

On the white jade plaza in front of the lord’s residence of Gluttonous City, glimmering like a mirror and shining brightly, a young girl stood with her fists clenched in front of her chest. She frowned and pouted at the dilapidated carriage, wanting to cry but unable to shed a tear.

What a loss!

The lord of Gluttonous City had suffered two narrow escapes and felt no joy—only heartache.

The first time, she had actually accepted her fate, acknowledging her inferiority in Ghost Valley. Many historical lords who once held great power were now worse off than her, working like dogs for White Cage City and Fragrant Shrine City, living lives even worse than that of a chicken or a dog. At least chickens and dogs could still crow and bark at passersby. Those former city lords, could they dare?

However, the second time, while it seemed calm and bloodless, was the most distressing for Fan Yunlu.

The favor owed to the infamous “Bone Sword Immortal” from Ghost Valley must always be repaid.

Without exception.

Fan Yunlu sniffled, wiped her face, and walked around the precious carriage, touching here and there, feeling heartbroken.

To restore it to its former glory would require a fair bit of summer coins. In Ghost Valley, without touching one’s savings, how difficult would it be to earn some fresh divine coins?

Suddenly, Fan Yunlu banged her forehead against the carriage, making a resounding thud.

She let out a frustrated wail.

The old woman who had barely made it back to the city felt increasingly guilty. At Crow Ridge, she had fled alongside the ghostly ladies from Gluttonous City, and a few ill-fated souls had been better off dying at the hands of that young swordsman than being taken away by that Golden Core ghost. She had escaped quickly, managing to gather a few ghostly ladies after the fact, but now seeing the lord’s state, the old woman felt her heart racing. Surely, the lord wouldn’t expect her to dip into her private savings to repair this precious carriage?

For a moment, the old woman even entertained the thought of switching allegiance to another city.

In Ghost Valley, it was a case of big fish eating small fish, and small fish eating shrimp. The lowest of shrimp could only eat mud.

Once casualties began to appear, the consequences were dire, and it was easy to attract the envy of surrounding forces. If several factions formed secret alliances and attacked together, Gluttonous City would surely face fragmentation.

Here, as long as there was conflict, the most taboo was a stalemate or inflicting harm on both sides, as greater forces would often seize the opportunity to swoop in. If two sides ended up fighting for someone else’s benefit, what was the point? However, once a city in Ghost Valley decided to take action, it was typically after careful consideration, certain of their prey, and thus often struck fatally, with a high chance of success.

Although Fan Yunlu was at Golden Core level, Gluttonous City still appeared weak. Therefore, she preferred to play tricks, such as half-heartedly leaking that her relationship with Pima Sect was quite good, claiming she had recognized a direct disciple of the sect stationed in Qinglu Town as a sworn brother. However, the old woman knew too well that it was just a load of nonsense. If the other party were willing to acknowledge her, it wouldn’t be limited to a sworn brother; she would be happy to accept being a godfather or even a revered ancestor. Fortunately, that cultivator was focused on seeking the Dao, uninterested in worldly matters. Within Pima Sect, he was a prodigy with potential, much like Yang Lin from the mural city, who was too lazy to bother with Gluttonous City’s petty schemes.

Gluttonous City was already the weakest among the southern cities of Ghost Valley. The ghostly ladies that had gone to Crow Ridge were all loyal subordinates of Fan Yunlu, and this trip had truly dealt a blow to the foundations of Gluttonous City.

That lady in white had already suffered severe injuries; at the very least, she would be bedridden for decades, if not a century. This was of little consequence in terms of combat power, as she wasn’t known for her fighting abilities, but she was the secret lover of the lord of Powdered Boy City, a fact well known in the southern Ghost Valley and not a secret at all. The lord’s wife was not only the lord’s partner but also the real decision-maker. Because of the matter regarding the lady in white, Powdered Boy City had always looked down upon Gluttonous City.

The old woman lowered her head slightly, her expression shifting between light and dark, contemplating whether to take a drastic step and steal the central artifact of Gluttonous City’s defensive array to switch sides with the lady of Powdered Boy City. 

If Powdered Boy City were to swallow Gluttonous City, perhaps she could even aspire to become the next lord of Gluttonous City.

In Ghost Valley, there were a total of thirty-six large and small cities, often experiencing a rotation of lords while the cities remained steadfast. When a lord changed, it was merely a matter of preference and a name change.

This was an unwritten rule in Ghost Valley, said to have originated from the Bone Observation City. When attacking and capturing cities, each side could engage in mutual strife, and regardless of how ruthless the victorious side was in exterminating the defeated, none would care. The only taboo was extensive destruction that utterly razed a city to ruins, unless one had the resources to rebuild within ten years. Otherwise, when the decade was up, the great earth immortal generals of Bone Observation City would march south, leaving nothing behind.

The old woman hesitated. Although she leaned more towards betraying Gluttonous City and the incompetent Fan Yunlu, she still found it difficult. This kind of treacherous act was ultimately not well-received in Ghost Valley, and even if she switched her allegiance, she would still face fierce exclusion from the veterans, who would seize the opportunity to cause trouble.

Her only hope was that the lady of Powdered Boy City, being a woman herself, would not care about loyalty or disloyalty.

Fan Yunlu suddenly stopped her frantic movements and turned to the old woman, looking pitiful. “That Pu from White Cage City told me that this year there will be another offering, and it’s going to be double. Granny Chang, what are we going to do? With our meager forces in Gluttonous City, where are we supposed to find decent artifacts that can catch the eye of White Cage City?”

The old woman’s heart trembled, and she smiled, “My lord, this is a stroke of luck amidst misfortune. It’s a good thing! Since Lord Pu has spoken, we in Gluttonous City won’t have to worry about any thieves for at least a hundred years.”

Fan Yunlu’s youthful face remained clouded with worry. “But Gluttonous City is running a deficit, and we have to exhaust our savings every time. Even if we can hold on for a hundred years, we’ll still end up dead eventually.”

The old woman could only force a smile and comfort her. “My lord need not lose heart; a hundred years isn’t too long or too short. If we catch a break once or twice, Gluttonous City might transform into one of the premier cities in the south. By then, not only will my lord not need to care about the glances from the lord of Fragrant Shrine City or Powdered Boy City, but Lord Pu may also come to rely on my lord.”

Fan Yunlu nodded.

She extended her finger, like a small cat washing its face, scratching the corner of her eye, and murmured, “I’m in such despair, yet I haven’t shed a single tear. This seems a bit off.”

The old woman was left speechless.

With a wave of her hand, Fan Yunlu gathered the carriage into her large sleeve, striding towards the main gate, shouting, “I’m going to make a straw man and stab that bastard in the bamboo hat!”

The old woman followed behind, her thoughts racing.

Was the lord’s remark a veiled threat? Or just a careless comment?

Fan Yunlu’s steps didn’t falter as she suddenly turned her head and asked, “By the way, what was that person’s name?”

The old woman awkwardly replied, “It seems he didn’t introduce himself.”

Fan Yunlu stopped in her tracks, stunned, before suddenly flailing her sleeves and stomping her feet, lamenting, “I can’t even make a straw man now!”

The old woman had no choice but to sigh.

In the lord’s chamber of the residence, how many small straw men had been piled up? When had any of them ever worked?

Fan Yunlu, being petite and dressed in oversized clothes, moving around the residence, resembled… a walking carrot.

By the deep stream at Mirror Mountain, Chen Ping'an, having made up his mind, employed various methods, such as pulling out a fishing rod made from the purple bamboo of Booklet Lake. He focused on an object at the bottom of the water, not daring to observe too much, quickly holding his breath and concentrating, then cast the hook into the water, attempting to snag some crystalline white bones or those broken magical artifacts that emitted faint golden light. However, after several tries, he was astonished to find that the scene at the bottom of the lake resembled a mirage—just an illusion. Each time he pulled the rod, it came back empty.

Chen Ping'an, still not believing in evil, tried a few more methods but was unable to retrieve anything from the depths. He suspected that this deep stream, nourished by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, formed a barrier akin to a water and mountain formation. In the end, he even fished out a broken barrier talisman and, using it to break through, hurled it into the water, then followed its path with the rod to delve into the depths. However, the talisman burned rapidly in the dark, heavy waters, and he still returned empty-handed.

Chen Ping'an squatted by the water's edge, feeling somewhat pained over the broken barrier talisman.

Yang Chongxuan, lying on the opposite white stone cliff, laughed, “Don’t think your flashy methods are clever. Throughout history, countless earth immortals have tried to retrieve treasures from this stream. There’s even a tale of a cultivator who used a priceless drinking bottle, expending spiritual energy to operate it, and ended up drawing countless waters from this stream. The water in that bottle alone could flood a grand dynasty city, yet he still failed to bring out a single item. A deal that ended in tremendous loss—do you know why?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I hope Yang Daoist can enlighten me.”

When traveling, addressing someone as Daoist was the least likely to offend.

Yang Chongxuan stacked his hands behind his head, basking in the sun and squinting at the sky, slowly saying, “Many mountains like to use beautiful female cultivators with the art of mirroring flowers and reflecting moons as a means to make money. For the male cultivators of the world, seeing a bowl of water, the fairy figures appearing in the water seem so close and within reach, but how far is the actual distance? How long can your fishing line stretch? One hundred thousand or eight thousand miles?”

Chen Ping'an understood suddenly, “So that’s how it is. I see now that I was overthinking.”

Yang Chongxuan continued, “As for extraordinary treasures, unless they’ve just emerged into the world, they can barely be considered within reach. As for Mirror Mountain, for hundreds of years, countless cultivators have scoured this old place. Without a bit of fortune, how could it be so easy to pocket anything? I’ve been here for so many years, and I’m still waiting in vain. So you needn’t feel embarrassed. I’ve used even more ridiculous methods back in the day, jumping directly into the deep stream to explore. It was easy to go down, but difficult to return; I floated around for a whole month, nearly drowning in there.”

Chen Ping'an sincerely praised, “Yang Daoist has impressive cultivation.”

Yang Chongxuan sighed, “It’s just so-so. The lord of Jingguan City reportedly explored the depths for a whole year but still failed to find that golden hairpin that opens the door to the mirror. Although this lord is a dead thing, enjoying immense advantages, I doubt I could last even a year if I died.”

Chen Ping'an curiously asked, “This stream is ultimately laden with yin energy. Once outside of Ghost Valley, if one finds a suitable buyer, a few pounds of this water could sell for a snowflake coin. Why did the cultivator who borrowed that drinking bottle end up losing everything, rather than making a fortune?”

Yang Chongxuan laughed, “Once this water leaves the territory of Mirror Mountain, the yin energy dissipates rapidly. Unless it’s kept in a small item, once too much water is taken, it overflows like a flood. That cultivator from the upper five realms made a mistake, retrieving the drinking bottle filled with too much water at the Bone Sands and it exploded on the spot. Thankfully, it was at Bone Sands, not far from the Waving River. If it had been elsewhere, he might have been pursued by the saints of the academy.”

Yang Chongxuan chuckled, “Ten pounds of unrefined stream water can sell for a snowflake coin at Bone Sands, provided you have a proper item and a small container. You also need one or two items similar to that drinking bottle; if their quality is too high, they can cause problems; if too low, they take up too much space. Those below the earth immortal realm don’t dare to come here for water. Earth immortals wouldn’t care about a few snowflake coins.”

Chen Ping'an took out a sword-raising gourd and submerged it in the stream to collect water.

After all, he was a half-baked qi practitioner who had opened a water estate. Initially spending money to drink that dark tea near the Waving River had also been to compensate for the moisture. If he could fill this gourd with stream water, it wouldn’t be a wasted trip to Mirror Mountain.

However, before leaving Ghost Valley, he could indeed make another trip to Mirror Mountain. There was no need to hope for that legendary drinking bottle, but he could prepare some jars and bottles to collect a few thousand pounds of stream water. When he returned to Bone Sands, he could see if he could strike a deal with the tea stall owner—this would also be a considerable income.

Yang Chongxuan merely glanced at the “crimson wine gourd” in Chen Ping'an's hand, slightly surprised but not overly concerned.

“Thank you for your advice, Daoist.”

Chen Ping'an stood up and clasped his fists, saying, “Since Mirror Mountain seems fated to have no connection with me, I bid farewell, Yang Daoist.”

Yang Chongxuan sat up, seemingly surprised. “You’re leaving just like that?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, adjusting his bamboo hat.

Yang Chongxuan lay back down on the stone cliff, closing his eyes. A moment later, he opened them again. “You’re really leaving? Should I say you’re decisive, or that you lack patience?”

Previously, that person had clearly used a small item to retract the fishing rod, not trying to conceal it at all.

Just like how he had casually dipped his foot into the water, it was a small gesture of goodwill.

In this Northern Julu Continent, to avoid unnecessary conflict, one needed to show a bit of their own cards.

Otherwise, many small, irritable ants would curse you to death even if you crushed them with your toes. They wouldn’t repent, and killing people wouldn’t fill one’s belly. After experiencing such things more frequently, “Yang Chongxuan” grew increasingly weary of it and found it utterly uninteresting. This was why he gradually became more amicable to others, such as that old fox from West Mountain, who had such a foul mouth. If it had been the old version of himself, he would have killed that old fox at least eighty times by now.

After the young traveler left Mirror Mountain, Yang Chongxuan felt slightly better.

What that person said truly resonated with him.

It’s better to avoid trouble than to seek it.

Moreover, this was a crucial period for Yang Chongxuan to seize opportunities.

He sat up, squinting intensely at the seemingly transparent deep stream.

This precious mirror, the speculation in the “Trustworthy Collection” was wrong—it wasn’t some bright mirror, nor was it a treasure specifically meant to illuminate demons and spirits but rather a long-lost item from the Three Mountains and Nine Halls realm.

Moreover, it was a semi-divine weapon.

 **Chapter 567: I’m Fine, How About You?**

Chen Ping'an had already left behind the Mirror Mountain.

To make this trip to Mirror Mountain, he had deviated quite a bit from the route to Qinglu Town. It seemed that relying on luck was indeed not suitable for him. If it had been Lu Tai or that Li Huai, the outcome might have been different.

After leaving Mirror Mountain, Chen Ping'an continued to choose the rugged mountains, gradually making his way toward Qinglu Town. The Golden Core specter and its ghostly minions had yet to make an appearance, which was only to be expected. After all, he had been pursued after the incident at Crow Ridge, and he had not deliberately concealed his strength. The side of the group led by Fan Yunluo, a Golden Core cultivator, had been utterly defeated. It was reasonable to believe that the band of "bandits" who had roamed the Ghostly Valley for years would not dare to come looking for trouble.

On the northbound path, the mountains and waters posed no hindrance. Many eerie spirits and strange creatures that could pose a fatal threat to a mid-Five Realms cultivator were largely cautious, merely glancing at Chen Ping'an from afar before retreating back into their forest lairs. 

For example, the giant python and spider demon on the iron chain bridge, when faced with that couple, might only need to exchange glances; they would not dare to risk crossing the bridge, fearing it would lead to their demise.

On this particular evening, Chen Ping'an took a break in a peach grove.

This peach grove was naturally strange; how could there still be peach blossoms in the middle of winter? However, Chen Ping'an was not afraid of the oddities on his journey through the Ghostly Valley; what worried him was the absence of any abnormalities.

Earlier, he had noticed two uneven stone tablets outside the peach grove, like a pair of neighboring houses bickering, inscribed with "Great Moon Round Temple" and "Little Xuandu Temple." If it weren’t for the smaller characters preceding "Xuandu Temple," Chen Ping'an would never have stepped into the peach grove. 

The true Xuandu Temple was a profound place in the realm of Qingming, daring to defy the control of the three leaders. It was rumored that the second Dao Lord had only drawn his immortal sword once in his own domain, and that was within Xuandu Temple itself.

Although he confirmed that the inscription on the stone tablet reading "Little Xuandu Temple" was not referring to the well-known Daoist sacred ground that echoed throughout the realm, before entering the grove, Chen Ping'an had still taken to the skies on his flying sword to survey the area, discovering that this expansive peach grove, covering at least a thousand acres, appeared to have no temples or Daoist structures at all.

This peach grove was not recorded in the "Rest Assured Collection" of the Pi Ma Sect. Therefore, it was reasonable to conclude that there were no fierce ghosts or great demons lurking here.

Chen Ping'an noticed that there were not even any dead peach wood branches around; the overhead canopy was overly lush, and the fragrance of peach blossoms was no longer pleasant; after a while, it became almost nauseating.

He removed his conical hat, sat cross-legged, and with two fingers pulled out a Yang Qi Lamp talisman from his sleeve. Gently rubbing it, the talisman began to burn slowly, with a speed similar to that of the fire from the Ghostly Valley's roads. It seemed that the evil aura in this place was indeed ordinary. However, the scent in the peach grove was a bit excessive. Chen Ping'an released his fingers, bent down to place the talisman in front of him, and then began practicing the Sword Furnace stance, circulating his pure true energy through various energy centers to prevent the overpowering fragrance from invading his body. He didn’t want to end up in a predicament.

Suddenly, a series of silver-bell-like laughs echoed from beneath the ground.

Chen Ping'an chose to ignore it.

As the laughter faded, it was replaced by a seductive voice, “This handsome young man, come into my pink tent, and smell the fragrance of my hair—what a delightful blessing! If I were you, I would never leave, just stay here, for eternity.”

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes and stared intently. A layer of mist was rising from the ground, but it did not ascend high, swaying just below a foot off the ground.

He was somewhat surprised. “Why has the Pi Ma Sect chosen to overlook the existence of you, this Peach Demon?”

The entire peach grove began to sway gently, like a group of beautiful women in pink skirts dancing gracefully. It seemed that the countless peach trees were merely her hair.

Chen Ping'an noticed that his surroundings were beginning to shimmer slightly. She seemed to be hidden deep beneath the ground, giggling and enticing, her voice filtering through, “Of course, the Pi Ma Sect's cultivators are afraid of me, what else could it be? You’re quite handsome, but a bit foolish; otherwise, you’d be a perfect match.”

Moments later, she suddenly stopped laughing and asked, “Hmm? How can you remain so still, both in body and in heart? Are you a monk with hair still on your head? Or a filthy cow-nose without a Daoist robe?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “If you keep playing tricks and haunting me, I might just cut down all the peach trees here and call it sword practice, leaving you to become a nun.”

Instead of getting angry, she laughed and exclaimed, “Alright then, I shall wait for your immortal sword techniques, dear young man.”

Chen Ping'an looked up.

A young Daoist boy, holding a whisk, appeared from thin air, his lips red and teeth white, with true energy spilling forth, radiating an undeniable spiritual aura. 

It seemed he was an extraordinary figure on the verge of becoming a Golden Core immortal.

The Daoist boy's gaze was icy as he cast a glance at Chen Ping'an. “This is the place where my master and his Daoist friends cultivate, an acknowledged paradise in the Ghostly Valley for a thousand years. We do not welcome outsiders, even the White Cage City’s Pu Rang, unless there’s an important matter, would not dare to enter the grove lightly. You, a wandering cultivator, why bother arguing with this little Peach Demon? Leave quickly!”

The Peach Demon clearly held a great fear of the young Daoist boy, muttering angrily, “What paradise? It's just a matter of using immortal arts to forcefully imprison me here, to protect the residual spiritual energy of that Daoist temple from leaking out.”

“Presumptuous!” 

The Daoist boy’s expression turned severe as he waved his whisk. A bolt of lightning, as thick as an arm, crashed into the ground, causing the Peach Demon to wail from deep within the earth, and peach blossoms began to flutter down from above.

Chen Ping'an understood now.

Within the Ghostly Valley, there must be some enlightened beings unafraid of the evil spirits, taking root here, relying on the abundant Yin energy filling the heavens and earth to sharpen their Daoist skills.

The Daoist boy, still not satisfied, spun his whisk again, conjuring a web of lightning that burrowed into the ground, creating a thunderous rumble from beneath. “Three days without punishment and the roof will collapse! If it weren’t for my master’s grace, how could you, a mere little Peach Demon skilled only in innate charm, stand in the Ghostly Valley? You dare to eavesdrop on my master discussing Dao with his friends, and with this opportunity, you have barely managed to cultivate to the Dragon Gate realm. You ungrateful spirit...”

The Peach Demon begged pitifully, desperately imploring the young Daoist boy for leniency.

The boy grew more agitated, and with another flick of his whisk, he summoned an ominous phenomenon from the clouds, ready to unleash a bolt of heavenly lightning upon the Peach Demon.

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to speak up, “Young Daoist, please calm down; I will leave the peach grove at once.”

A dark cloud descended from the high sea of clouds, slowly descending, with lightning crackling, a truly fearsome sight.

The Daoist boy sneered, “If it weren’t for us cultivating here in the peach grove, had you stumbled into this place, you would have long been drained of your Yang energy by this Peach Demon, you clueless fool. My master is right; you worldly men, soaked in the mundane world daily...” 

Chen Ping'an took a step back and with a swift punch sent the cloud scattering, disrupting the energy within, causing a gust of wind that swept through the peach grove, sending the vibrant peach blossoms falling like rain.

The Daoist boy furrowed his brow, speechless.

It wasn’t that he was afraid; it was just a bit unexpected. 

Such a young martial arts master? Observing the might of that punch just now, it was both concentrated and grand, though he hadn’t yet reached the Golden Body realm, he was not far off. 

However, the Daoist boy himself forgot that he was also a “young” cultivator of the Dragon Gate realm.

Although he had entered the cave dwelling realm too early, at that time his master had explained the profound mysteries of cultivation, asking him if he wanted to take this opportunity to maintain his youthful appearance. At that time, he was naive and thought the body was merely a filthy shell. As it did not hinder his future cultivation, he thought it wouldn’t hurt to stop “growing,” and from then on, his appearance was fixed. For the past sixty years, this “young Daoist boy” had nearly regretted it.

He should have allowed his body to mature into that of a man before “stopping.”

Thus, every time he sneaked out for a breath of fresh air, encountering the young girl Fan Yunluo several times, he would become quite irritated. The old monk would only fan the flames, teasing him about how he and Fan Yunluo were a perfect match.

After retracting his punch, Chen Ping'an smiled. “What you said is reasonable, but when it comes to reasoning, if it’s truly for the other party to understand, and not just to placate one’s own conscience, then the mindset and tone are also very important. It’s not a bad thing to remain calm and speak kindly.”

The Peach Demon, nearly frightened to death, quickly chimed in, “That’s right, that’s right! This is worth listening to.”

The Daoist boy, with his arm wrapped around the white whisk made from the bones of heroic spirits, was hesitant. 

A fight was not the way of the Little Xuandu Temple's Daoists. However, since the other party was a martial man wandering through the Ghostly Valley, wasn't it appropriate to spar a little? Surely his master wouldn’t blame him?

Just then, a golden-armored strongman strode over, looking at the Daoist boy’s back, and said solemnly, “Xu Song, the True Lord requests this young master to come to the temple for a discussion.”

The Daoist boy shouted angrily, “What virtue or ability does this fellow have to enter our Little Xuandu Temple?!”

The golden-armored strongman ignored the Daoist boy's fury and turned to Chen Ping'an, who had just adjusted his conical hat. “Young master, my True Lord invites you. If you are not in a hurry, you can come to our Little Xuandu Temple for a cup of millennia-old peach nectar tea.”

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists in refusal, “Having accidentally intruded into the peach grove and disturbed your True Lord's tranquility, I truly dare not intrude upon your temple. I shall take my leave.”

The golden-armored strongman nodded. “In that case, I will not insist. If you wish to drink tea at the temple in the future, just summon the Peach Demon here to guide you.”

Chen Ping'an turned and left the peach grove.

The young Daoist boy, named Xu Song, snorted. “Good riddance! Saved me from having to drink that peach nectar tea that only that old bone has tasted three times!”

The Peach Demon, from deep below, flattered, “Indeed, indeed! This person truly lacks insight, missing out on such great fortune. Next time I come to the peach grove, I’ll hide and never see him again.”

Xu Song was furious. “You dare to treat my master’s orders lightly?!”

The Peach Demon immediately begged for mercy. “I wouldn’t dare! I absolutely wouldn’t dare!”

In an ancient Daoist temple filled with peach trees, a white-haired, youthful old Daoist sat across from a thin, old monk. The old monk was as thin as a skeleton, but draped in an unusually large robe.

The old Daoist smiled and asked, “How was that punch?”

The old monk replied slowly, “Too rigid, easy to break.”

The old Daoist glanced at a cup of tea on the table, then asked, “Do you think this cup of peach nectar tea needs to be kept? Do you think that young man will return to the peach grove and drink it all up?”

The old monk's expression was wooden. “Too many words lead to loss.”

The old Daoist wore no Daoist crown, only a carefree scarf, and his Daoist robe was old and ordinary, lacking any signs of an immortal's presence.

He sighed softly. “The three goddesses of the Wall Painting City have already left the scroll, each following their own master. There are also five Realms cultivators from another continent who have teamed up with that He Xiaoliang to break into the Ghostly Valley and head to Jingguan City. Yang Chongxuan still has signs of seizing fortune. If Pu Rang stirs up some commotion again, attracting Zhu Quan to act personally, the Ghostly Valley will be thrown into complete chaos, and our remaining paradise may very well become disconnected from purity.”

The withered old monk nodded. “The True Lord has foresight.”

Hearing the name Pu Rang, the old monk silently recited a Buddhist chant.

The old Daoist had already sensed the unusual state of the other party's heart, but both sides knew each other well, and there was no need for many words.

The old Daoist looked up. “For us cultivators, if even life and death are blurred, then where in the world is not a cage? The less one knows, the more at ease one feels. Once one knows, how can one truly find peace?”

The old monk pondered for a moment, then lowered his head and folded his hands, revealing a pair of dry but golden-yellow palms. “This impoverished monk’s Buddhist teachings cannot even support this robe. How can I see the Buddha? How can I question this ancient difficulty?”

The old monk slowly rose, hands together, and bowed.

The old Daoist did not engage in elaborate formalities with this old friend, merely nodded.

As the old monk stepped out, he vanished, returning to the Great Full Moon Temple, which was similar to the Little Xuandu Temple, both being Daoist residences that formed their own small worlds amidst the peach grove. Unless one was at the Yuan Ying stage, no one could wander about the peach grove for a thousand years without seeing or entering.

Within the temple, the sound of chanting wafted through the air. An old monk sat on a cushion, while other monks walked slowly down the corridor, heads bowed, and a small novice diligently swept the ground beneath the trees, each busy with their tasks, without a word exchanged between them.

The withered old monk stood in place, and in his vision, those monks were merely bones.

After passing through the grand hall where the golden Buddha was shrouded in mist, the old monk, hands together, walked forward solemnly.

This almost perfected Golden Body Arhat, the old monk, was gradually joined by several monks who resembled him in appearance but differed greatly in age. They wore different robes and appeared out of thin air, a total of four, each with questions to ask, yet the old monk merely ignored them, deaf to their voices, and continued forward.

A young monk, with a look of regret, asked, “Why not drink that cup of peach nectar tea? Drinking it could save you years of cultivation! You'd be that much closer to the Western Pure Land of the Buddha, even half a step would be good.”

A middle-aged monk, filled with rage, shouted at the old monk like thunder, “What kind of Buddhist teachings do you practice? With so many spirits and demons in the Ghostly Valley, why not go and liberate them?”

A monk draped in a gorgeous robe, arrogant in demeanor, looked sideways at the old monk and sneered, “This kind of bitter cultivation is not the right way.”

The last monk, whose appearance was closest to the old monk's, asked softly, “Are you me? Am I you?”

Finally, a tall, young monk, with his back turned to the steadfastly walking old monk, gazed toward a bamboo fence blooming with peach blossoms, murmuring, “The peach blossoms smile brightly beyond the fence, seeming to bloom and fade with deep affection.”

The old monk hesitated slightly but quickly took large strides forward. Moments later, he resumed his usual pace.

If one did not look up, an ordinary person entering this temple would feel that the sunlight was bright and warm.

In truth, merely lifting one’s gaze would reveal a crescent moon hanging in the air.

At the Little Xuandu Temple, the old Daoist arrived beneath a towering peach tree, squatted down, and with two fingers, pinched some soil, gently rubbing it.

The soil in the old Daoist's fingertips was the coveted ten-thousand-year soil that the mountain's cultivators dreamed of, heavy as gold and iron.

The old Daoist remained silent.

Soil also has its age, and it goes through “birth, aging, sickness, and death.” People say it is as unmoving as a mountain, but it is not entirely so. Ultimately, mortals have a limited lifespan, and time is finite; they see things vaguely, neither clear nor long-term. Thus, the Buddhist saying goes, “A Buddha observes a bowl of water, and forty-eight thousand insects dwell within.” The old monk from the Great Full Moon Temple uses this as a method of meditation; he merely sees it on a larger scale—appreciating the moon.

As for this old Daoist, he observes more quietly, watching the changes of time in these lifeless soils.

The two temples had been neighbors for a thousand years, yet neither had managed to determine superiority.

Now it was merely a matter of who would become a Heavenly Lord first or who would attain Bodhisattva first.

The young Daoist boy Xu Song cautiously approached his master, realizing that his master was deep in thought, so he remained silent.

The old Daoist did not turn around but smiled and asked, “Outside the temple, not only could you not assert your dominance, but you also received a beating from a young martial artist. Do you think his words were reasonable?”

Holding his whisk, the boy gloomily replied, “What he said was reasonable, but what does that have to do with me?”

The old Daoist nodded, tossing the soil aside, smoothing it with his pristine white palm. After standing up, he said, “All sentient beings, and those with feelings, gradually ascend, understanding the ruthlessness of the Great Dao. If you can learn from the Dragon Tiger Mountain Daoist to slay demons and do good deeds, accumulating merits, that wouldn’t be bad. But to learn the ruthless path from me, seeking the truth, is even better.”

The old Daoist smiled. “The ruthless path does not teach you to act cruelly or slaughter innocents but rather to observe the seasons and the constancy of the heavens and earth.”

Xu Song solemnly bowed to his master.

The old Daoist turned his gaze toward the direction of the Great Full Moon Temple, softly saying, “Greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and doubt—if the five poisons are not eliminated, yet one stubbornly dedicates themselves to bitter cultivation, what ultimately manifests is not the true method of Zen, but rather a perverse fixation.”

The old Daoist then looked toward the north beyond the peach grove. “Xu Song, if you cannot comprehend the Great Dao for the time being, you might consider trying to be a good person in the eyes of the mundane world. Just remember, doing good deeds among mortals has little to do with the goodness and badness that the world returns to you. Different paths can lead to the same destination; this is also part of the ruthless way... of the Dao.”

Xu Song shook his head. “I can’t be that kind of good person.”

The old Daoist did not comment.

Xu Song cautiously asked, “Master, is the true Xuandu Temple also like this, with spring-like seasons and blooming peach flowers?”

The old Daoist laughed. “If so, you shouldn’t stay in this vast world; go to the Qingming realm where the Daoist masters reside and see for yourself the truth and falsehood. If you really have this intention, I will have this Peach Demon carry you away from the Ghostly Valley, and after leaving, you can first go to that young sect master He to cultivate beside him, providing you with an even better opportunity to visit the Xuandu Temple.”

Xu Song vigorously shook his head. “No, no! Wherever you cultivate, that is where I will cultivate.”

The old Daoist patted Xu Song's head.

Xu Song smiled with squinted eyes.

The old Daoist suddenly sighed, “I just remembered, it’s been a long time since I’ve had a cup of the river's shadowy tea. After a thousand years, I imagine the taste will only grow richer.”

As twilight deepened, Chen Ping'an found himself not too far from Qinglu Town, merely a two-hundred-mile journey, passing by a serene green lake.

Earlier, from a distant mountain, he had seen a bonfire ignited in this area, so he hurried over, thinking that if he encountered wandering spirits at night, he could conveniently slay them for some profit.

This trip to the Ghostly Valley had not offered much experience; he had only fought at Crow Ridge and exchanged a punch in the peach grove, but he had earned a considerable sum.

Not to mention the white lady's snowflake robe from the greasy city, he had also collected over a dozen valuable gleaming bones. As for how much he could sell the latter for, that was still uncertain.

As for the water from the deep chasm of Mirror Mountain, while it might not be worth much, it had saved Chen Ping'an some minor troubles. He had previously downed two pounds of mountain spring water in one go, then breathed deeply, immersing his mind and spirit, entering the water domain, where the little green-clad boys were quite lively and joyous.

What surprised him by the lake was a striking young man dressed in mud-gold, accompanied by two attendants, seemingly planning to rest by the lake for the night.

Chen Ping'an calculated his stamina and route; the others had likely passed Lánshè Town, finished their sightseeing, and were now heading straight toward Qinglu Town along the official road, which was why their paths had crossed.

Thus, this inconspicuous little lake was likely the Copper Green Lake mentioned in the "Rest Assured Collection," as it paired perfectly with the nearby Copper Official Mountain, just like a couple.

There were two famous types of fish in Copper Green Lake, but they were difficult to catch, with many strict rules. Chen Ping'an had seen the complicated guidelines in the book and had no choice but to give up.

In the lake lived a species of fish covered in golden scales, with wings and a sound resembling that of mandarin ducks—extremely precious and rare, appearing once in a hundred years. It was said that these fish always appeared in pairs; if one was caught, the other would automatically come ashore and enter the fish basket. A pair of palm-sized fish could sell for two Gu Yu coins, and it was rumored that eating them could prevent any nightmares from troubling one.

Additionally, there were silver carp, which were quite large, claimed to grow a pound each year. After a hundred years, their strength in the water was immense. Unlike the rare fish, silver carp were not exclusive to this lake and were praised by cultivators as minor lake dragons. Their flesh and scales bore no oddities, except for one peculiar trait: those silver carp that were descendants of the dragon lineage would grow two dragon whiskers after living for a hundred years, about an inch long, and every three hundred years, the whiskers would grow an inch longer. If they could grow a full foot-long dragon whisker, it would be a true treasure. 

Incorporating such a whisk into the crafting of demon-binding ropes and whisks would enhance their usefulness greatly.

However, having passed through the Dragon's Hollow and the Inverted Mountain, Chen Ping'an was aware that there were indeed Daoists in the world who had crafted a complete semi-immortal weapon whisk from genuine dragon whiskers.

Thus, he did not harbor any strong desires for the elusive rare fish and silver carp in Copper Green Lake.

It simply consumed too much time.

All the records of captures in the "Rest Assured Collection" indicated that cultivators spent a long time, often several months or even half a year, during which they had to outsmart and battle the two types of immortal fish, often missing their chances.

Compared to Copper Green Lake, Chen Ping'an had higher hopes for Copper Official Mountain, where mixed-blood mountain-moving apes and mountain-chasing dogs roamed.

Upon Chen Ping'an's arrival, the young man remained composed.

The six-realm female martial artist, armed with a bow and sword, shifted her position to block the way between her master and the unexpected guest.

The old man in black robes maintained a blank expression, one hand holding an apricot-yellow porcelain flask and the other a large piece of sauced meat, chewing slowly.

Chen Ping'an picked up some dry branches from afar and lit a bonfire.

The master and servant trio clearly intended to come to Copper Green Lake. After eating and drinking, the old man in black took out sections of vibrant green bamboo from his belongings, piecing together a long fishing rod, with fishing line as thin as hair and a golden hook as large as a palm.

Meanwhile, the young man rolled up his sleeves, squatting by the water's edge, preparing the bait. He vigorously mixed it in a wooden basin, occasionally adding a ladle of lake water, and pulled out a porcelain bottle to add a few drops of a pungent red liquid.

Chen Ping'an, who enjoyed fishing, couldn’t help but watch a little longer.

The woman spoke softly beside the young man.

The young man raised his arm to wipe away the sweat from his forehead, saying a few words.

The woman then stood up and walked toward Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an got up and said, “I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to intrude.”

The woman’s expression was cold, but her words were relatively gentle. “It’s fine to watch. However, my young master said that when fishing for silver carp, it is quite taboo to make noise on the shore. Any slight disturbance, and the silver carp will hear and flee. Therefore, after we bait the fish, for half an hour, when we cast our rods, both of us will need to extinguish the bonfire and not move about casually. If you find it inconvenient, you may rest further from the shore.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, extinguished the bonfire, and chose to retreat to a distance, sitting under a large tree, hands tucked into his sleeves, watching the trio as they fished for the immortal fish at night.

During this time, the young man noticed that Chen Ping'an had extinguished the fire and turned to offer an apologetic smile. Chen Ping'an returned the gesture with a smile and a nod.

The woman returned to the young man's side, letting out a small sigh of relief.

The young man laughed, “Sister Fan, with all this bait I’m putting in, the Copper Green Lake is surely going to rise by a foot!”

The woman laughed helplessly.

Baiting for the extraordinary fish in the vast lake was essential and quite costly. The rarer the fish, the more a fisherman had to spend, and the young master was never one to be stingy, leading to his nickname among fellow practitioners on the mountain as Yuan Yichun.

Though Chen Ping'an was far away, he could tell that the wealthy young man was pouring a significant sum just to bait the fish.

It was not just a matter of a few snowflake coins; perhaps even a couple of small summer coins were involved.

After the baiting was done, the three fell silent, waiting quietly.

Chen Ping'an took out his sword-raising gourd, drank some spring water, and began to close his eyes to rest.

When the old man in black finally cast his line, Chen Ping'an opened his eyes.

With a whoosh, the fishing line arched out in a massive arc, falling deep into the center of Copper Green Lake.

The long night stretched on.

Fishing for great fish in a vast lake relied not just on skill, but also on patience.

The young man sat on a small rosewood stool, resting his chin on his hands, yawning repeatedly.

The woman remained standing behind the young man, keeping a wary eye on the young wanderer in the conical hat, knowing that he was traveling down the mountain, and though he meant no harm, one could never be too careful.

Two hours later, the young man began to doze off.

The old man in black gently lifted his rod a few times to scatter the bait before casting again, exhibiting incredible patience.

The female martial artist remained completely still.

Chen Ping'an leaned against the tree, gazing up at the night sky.

The bright moon rose above the mountains, amidst the vast sea of clouds.

In the vastness of the world, there are countless mountains and rivers, yet only one moon.

Chen Ping'an stared blankly.

It was said that many celestial paintings created by immortals on the mountain depicted the rising and setting of the sun and moon, the changing of the seasons, flowers blooming and withering.

How could the world be so vast, and humans so small?

Why does one feel so lonely as they grow up?

Chen Ping'an gently lowered his conical hat to cover his face.

Miss Ning, I’m fine. How about you?

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 568: The Jade Capital in the Sky (Part One)

At dawn, the old man in the black robe had already reeled in his fishing rod. The silver carp, naturally fond of moonlight but fearful of sunlight, only ventured out from the depths of the water at night, swimming about in search of food. If, by chance, one were to bite the hook during the day, even if dragged ashore, the sentient silver carp would choose to self-destruct, causing the two dragon whiskers to lose their spiritual essence. Although this wouldn’t result in them completely becoming mundane objects, it would nonetheless severely diminish their quality.

However, the trio was not disheartened. Fishing for large fish in the lake was a common endeavor; whether it be the silver carp or the common catches sought by ordinary fishermen, it was not unusual to wait all night without any success. After the old man packed up his rod, he began to replace the fishing line and hooks, the latter becoming exquisitely delicate, no larger than a thumb. The young man also started to prepare bait anew, spending even more money, likely aiming to fish for the rarer golden carp.

Remembering something, the young man turned to the large tree and called out, “Fellow Daoist, catching the golden carp is purely a matter of luck; there are no taboos to worry about. Would you like to fish in the center of the lake together? I have a bamboo raft, and we can fish together.”

The young woman, who was accompanying him, wanted to stop him but was too late.

The young man pulled out a heavy copper coin the size of a child’s palm, rubbed it gently with both hands, and conjured a miniature bamboo raft about the length of a finger out of thin air. He blew lightly on it, then tossed it into the lake, and the raft suddenly expanded, sending ripples across the water.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded and jumped down from the branch, walking towards the shore.

The young woman used a sound-concentrating technique to remind the old man in black that the young man was also a martial artist, likely on par with her in terms of cultivation.

Last night, he had slept in the tree, his breathing long and steady, like a babbling brook, with pure and refined fist intent, indicating he was a master who had truly entered the realm of martial arts.

Such deep sleep among martial artists generally occurs only after reaching the third stage of spirit refining, a state akin to sleep yet not quite sleep, where their fist intent flows throughout their body as if protected by a divine spirit.

Therefore, this young vagabond was likely from a prominent family.

The old man in black, using the ripples of his heart lake, conveyed to the young woman, “I’m only worried about those unscrupulous earthly immortals. If he’s a well-versed young martial artist, there's nothing to worry about. Our Sanlang Temple fears neither those without legs nor those on the mountains. Don’t worry about the fishing; I’ll keep a close eye on him. The young master is wearing both a ceremonial robe and protective armor, capable of withstanding two full-strength strikes from a Core Formation swordsman without any mistakes.”

Chen Ping'an stepped onto the bamboo raft, and the young woman skillfully paddled, guiding the raft slowly toward the center of the lake. Sitting on the bench that the young man had handed over, Chen Ping'an thanked him and took out his fishing rod, knowing that the special bait could only be borrowed from the young master. The woman’s gaze shifted slightly; it was rare to see a martial artist carrying personal items. Indeed, he was from a wealthy family. The old man, however, remained unfazed, maintaining a calm demeanor as he chatted with the young vagabond who had removed his conical hat, both parties sharing an unspoken connection without mentioning names or family backgrounds.

A martial artist dressed in a ceremonial robe traveling around meant that this person had yet to reach the third stage of spirit refining in martial arts.

The well-born young man, clearly inexperienced in the ways of the world, straightforwardly said after casting his line alongside Chen Ping'an, “This young master believes that among those who genuinely enjoy fishing, there are hardly any bad people. Don’t you agree? Grandpa Liu and Sister Fan are overly cautious with you, and I think that’s not very good.”

The old man in black remained unperturbed, picking up some bait from a wooden basin and casually tossing it into the lake.

However, the young woman named Fan found it a bit awkward.

Chen Ping'an didn’t know how to respond, so he took a moment to think before saying something diplomatic: “There might be bad people, but there are definitely fewer of them. While going down the mountain for experiences, being overly cautious isn’t too much to ask.”

The young man shook his head and sighed, “I know you mean well, but my great-grandfather, grandfather, and even my parents, every time I leave home, their words are always like this. I’m honestly getting a bit tired of it.”

Chen Ping'an fell silent. After all, this was merely a chance encounter, and discussing someone else's family matters seemed inappropriate.

But was this young man being a bit too casual? He must come from an exceptionally good family to be so carefree.

Chen Ping'an's thoughts stirred, yet he pretended not to notice and continued to focus on the surface of the lake.

The old man in black turned to look into the distance, smiling as he said, “Young master, Du Wensi from the Pi Ma Sect is almost here. We lingered too long in Lan Sha Town, and it’s likely our travel schedule was off, which made this young man of the Core Formation anxious.”

The young man looked somewhat resentful; he despised these social encounters. If it were peers who shared interests, it would be fine, but when it came to relationships cultivated by their ancestors, he was truly not adept at managing such connections. The woman whispered, “Young master, I’ve heard that Du Wensi has a gentle temperament and is unconcerned with worldly affairs. Years ago, he left the Bone Marsh to travel north, passing by our family’s doorstep and forming a bond with our old master. He will likely get along well with you.”

The young man nodded and made a face at the woman, saying with a smile, “Sister Fan, I still understand the etiquette of being outside.”

The woman’s gaze softened, her lips curling into a smile.

Chen Ping'an stole a glance but quickly withdrew his gaze.

Well then.

This foolish young man most likely wouldn’t grasp the unspoken words in Sister Fan’s eyes for quite some time.

A figure clad in a white hemp robe, a qi practitioner riding the wind, approached leisurely, while distant thunder rolled ominously, like winter thunder rumbling.

As he neared Tonglu Lake, the Pi Ma Sect’s earthly immortal slowed his flying sword’s speed. Though his pace remained swift, it was almost silent, as if he were moving without a sound.

He didn’t alight directly onto the bamboo raft but chose to wait quietly on the shore, refraining from speaking, possibly out of concern for disturbing the fish in Tonglu Lake.

He certainly looked like a good-tempered fellow.

Chen Ping'an was about to retract his fishing rod when the young man laughed and said, “If you still want to fish, go ahead. The bamboo raft is yours; I might need to head to Qinglu Town first, then return here to fish for that silver carp. You have your personal items, so I can teach you a simple incantation to summon and dismiss the bamboo raft. It’s very easy. You can take it to Qinglu Town and casually hand it over to the Pi Ma Sect’s disciples.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “No need; I need to head out immediately. This time, I’m fishing to relax.”

The young man wasn’t one to forcibly impose his goodwill on others.

Returning to the shore, the young man put away the bamboo raft and greeted the young Core Formation master from the Pi Ma Sect with a bright smile, saying, “Sanlang Temple's Yuan Xuan greets Uncle Du.”

Du Wensi nodded with a smile, “I guessed you’d be fishing at Tonglu Lake, so I originally planned to come find you later. However, Sect Master Zhu urged me to come sooner, so I couldn’t delay. How is your great-grandfather doing these days?”

Yuan Xuan replied, “He’s still quite robust.”

Du Wensi chuckled.

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists and took his leave.

When Chen Ping'an’s gaze met Du Wensi’s, both nodded in acknowledgment almost simultaneously.

After walking a few steps, Yuan Xuan caught up with him and said softly, “If you’re heading to Qinglu Town, it’s best to take the official road. It may be a detour, but it ensures safety. If you seek speed, you’ll have to pass through that area where the great monsters roam, where each one claims the land as their own, with astonishing audacity. They are collectively referred to as the Six Saints, banding together to challenge the several city lords in the central area of the Ghostly Marsh Valley, which is quite fierce. The spirit creatures and those monsters often engage in skirmishes, akin to a battlefield; it’s said that there’s a great demon specifically collecting military texts and studying strategies, which is rather amusing.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’ll be extra cautious. I wish you great success in fishing, with a bountiful catch of both golden carp and silver carp.”

Yuan Xuan nodded vigorously, realizing he had let something slip, and introduced himself, “I’m Yuan Xuan, a disciple of Sanlang Temple.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment before smiling and saying, “I’m Chen Ping'an, from the Treasure Bottle Continent.”

Yuan Xuan grinned, “Actually, from your accent, I could tell you were from another continent.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Just an old traveler.”

Yuan Xuan paused, “Is that the truth?”

Chen Ping'an said, “Just courtesy.”

Yuan Xuan laughed heartily, visibly delighted.

Just as he thought, fishing friends are all one family; there aren’t any bad people among them.

Having loved fishing since childhood, he had naturally been brought into this world by his great-grandfather, who had long said that wise men love water and enjoy fishing. It’s a rare delight, as wise and nimble people find it most difficult to remain calm, whereas fishing requires an emphasis on tranquility.

The two bid farewell at this point.

Yuan Xuan and his entourage followed Du Wensi along the official road to Qinglu Town.

Chen Ping'an headed towards Tongguan Mountain.

He planned to encounter the mountain-moving monkeys and chasing mountain dogs there, especially the former, as he wanted to learn more about their copper-skinned and iron-boned strengths.

As for the Sanlang Temple where Yuan Xuan was from, Chen Ping'an had learned some details while researching the customs of Jiu Lu Continent in Longquan County. Sanlang Temple was the largest weapons shop in North Jiu Lu, well-regarded, and genuinely had friends across the world. Of course, the most famous thing about the Sanlang Temple's disciples was that they were all exceptionally strong.

No wonder.

Young Yuan Xuan was so innocent and kind-hearted.

He reminded Chen Ping'an of Fan Er from Old Dragon City.

It seemed similar to Liu Youzhou from Aihai Continent, who owned a monkey palace at the Hanging Mountain.

A disciple from Sanlang Temple, who was deemed important enough for Sect Master Zhu Quan to pay attention to and for Du Wensi to personally greet, did the creatures of Ghostly Marsh Valley really merit terms like "great demons" or "fierce"?

Ultimately, this was a kind reminder for Chen Ping'an.

If all wealthy families had such children, perhaps the world would be much more peaceful.

Unfortunately, the princes encountered at Shujian Lake, Huang He, and the border inns of the Daqin Dynasty on Tongye Continent, along with the prince who failed to kill Chen Ping'an on a snowstorm night and was instead killed, were abundant.

Even if they were encountered and eliminated, it seemed there was no end to them. These individuals who reached high positions through their lineage would continue to emerge like bamboo shoots after the rain, with the spring breeze bringing them back, never ceasing to sprout like the green grass.

Is it that there are too few people like Master Qi in this world, or that individuals like Cui Zhan must exist?

Chen Ping'an walked along the desolate mountain paths, took a sip from his sword nurturing gourd, and found it was just mountain stream water, not wine.

He looked back at his own figure under the sunlight.

With a gentle push of his toes, he leapt over the dried yellow grass and headed straight for Tongguan Mountain.

The mountain-moving great sage, one of the six saints of Ghostly Marsh Valley, hailed from Tongguan Mountain. That mountain-moving monkey, with a body tempered to immense strength, wielded a pair of meteor hammers.

Meanwhile, on Yuan Xuan’s side, after realizing that Du Wensi was a quiet and amiable elder, he became more talkative, sharing all sorts of interesting experiences he encountered along the way.

During this time, Du Wensi glanced back unintentionally at the young vagabond’s retreating figure, contemplating. This young Core Formation master, who was comparable to Yang Lin from the mural city, had noticed something. There were some issues near the skinning city, reportedly involving a young sword immortal who heavily injured Fan Yunlu, almost ending her life. It was only due to Pu Rang from White Cage City intervening that a larger commotion was avoided. He couldn’t help but wonder how Yuan Xuan came to know this person. The young man didn’t seem like a hasty practitioner; why was he so bright and prominent? Having just arrived at Ghostly Marsh Valley, he had already drawn the attention of Pu Rang? If Pu Rang were intent on killing, no one in Ghostly Marsh Valley could stop him, not even the sect master or the spirit being from Jingguan City in the Jade Purity realm.

Pu Rang was known for being ruthless and never holding back against sword cultivators.

Du Wensi reflected on the recent events that had stirred the winds and grass, the undercurrents among various cities, and felt a sense of worry.

There was an ominous feeling rising in the air.

Du Wensi was already considered one of the qi practitioners least concerned with worldly affairs outside of cultivation. From the sect master to his peers, they intentionally kept him out of such matters, allowing him to focus solely on breaking through his bottlenecks. Yet even he was beginning to sense the unrest and seriousness of the situation in Ghostly Marsh Valley. It was easy to imagine.

As for the claims of Fan Yunlu from the skinning city that she was her义兄 (yìxiōng, sworn brother), Du Wensi could only laugh and cry at the same time, feeling somewhat impressed by her ability to come up with such a story, and he let her be.

The foundation of a cultivator's path is like a mountain, with worldly affairs being just fleeting clouds. The grass and trees on the mountain flourish and wither, while the stream flows; there’s no need to hold on to anything, so there’s nothing to fuss over.

Chen Ping'an walked slowly, his thoughts drifting far away, unable to find peace.

This world might not be as good as we imagine.

But it also might not be as bad as we think.

However, each "might" implies unexpected surprises and possibilities.

Every person encountered along the path of life might be a dreamer bound by others' concerns.

Chen Ping'an increasingly understood the mindset of those who do evil.

Yet he still couldn’t grasp why such individuals could live so well, even better than good people.

Unknowingly, his gaze grew deep and profound.

The gloom in Chen Ping'an's heart quickly dissipated; he simply felt a bit frustrated. When he reached Tongguan Mountain, he encountered neither the mountain-moving monkeys nor the chasing mountain dogs.

It seemed that Du Wensi’s earlier wind-riding journey had created too much commotion, scaring off the spirits and demons in the area.

This left Chen Ping'an feeling helpless.

Usually, the temperamental mountain-moving monkeys would easily reveal themselves if they caught even a whiff of human scent.

Chen Ping'an deliberately lingered, but after a significant amount of time passed without even a single fish biting, with his ordinary fifth-level martial artist cultivation, he still couldn’t find a single fish.

He decided to rest in a place with a wide view, planning to spend the night there. If there was no response by morning, he would give up and continue his journey. He simply didn’t believe he wouldn’t encounter even one of the six saintly monsters afterward.

After night fell, Chen Ping'an lit a campfire, sitting through the night while practicing the sword furnace stance.

In the end, he had to leave Tongguan Mountain.

Within a foul-smelling secret cave on Tongguan Mountain, a silver-backed mountain-moving monkey, opting not to take on a human form, observed through a palm-sized hidden window. Although it moved like a person, its facial features and body shape, along with its shaggy fur, were still quite conspicuous.

It waved its hand, and soon a small, shifty-eyed man approached.

The mountain-moving monkey croaked, “Hurry and report to the mountain-moving great sage and those guests. Tell them this guy really came; it’s confirmed, he’s the one who caused a major setback for the skinning city.”

The small man was about to leave through an underground passage.

The mountain-moving monkey reminded him, “Remember to be clever; choose a hidden route. It’s better to take a detour than to stumble into that man’s sword. If you die, it won’t matter, but if you delay the great sage’s business, I’ll stew your whole family of little rats.”

The man flattered, “I won’t mess up the big matter.”

He followed the underground path, emerging from a crevice in the stone wall far away from the cave. He then leaped forward, transforming back into a massive black rat, and began to run wildly.

Birds have their paths, and rats have their routes.

This rat demon, seemingly plump, was incredibly agile, racing through the mountains and valleys like a bolt of lightning, daring not to linger for even a moment.

Once out of the Tongguan Mountain territory, the rat demon suddenly burrowed underground and vanished. After about half an incense stick's worth of time, it emerged from a tree root a mile away, peeking around to ensure no one was following before continuing on its way.

However, what the rat demon didn’t realize was that a stranger was following behind it, someone who had removed his conical hat, sword, and sword-nurturing gourd, then placed a youthful mask over his face.

The rat demon had been cautious enough, yet it seemed the other party’s cultivation was a notch higher.

At noon, after carefully crossing the border between the territories of two great demons, the rat demon finally reached the mountain top of the mountain-moving great sage, transforming back into a human form, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath.

Though the six great saints shared a common bond against enemies, it was not unusual for there to be squabbles among family members or brothers. Minor conflicts and frictions were commonplace, but it was unfortunate for the weaker little minions, as they sometimes unwittingly became meals for one of the great sages. After all, filling them up could raise their own cultivation. Especially those half-formed spirits, who could barely maintain human form for too long, had such little lives.

On the wide mountain road, the rat demon arrived at its own territory, brimming with confidence. Just as it was about to start climbing, it noticed a familiar figure on a small path approaching from another direction—hunched and swaying, like an unsteady old farmer.

The rat demon was delighted and scampered over, shouting, “Little one pays respects to the ancestor!”

The old man, wrapped in a thick hemp rope and wearing straw sandals, looked unassuming, his eyes squinting into slits as if his eyesight was poor and his hearing not keen. He tilted his head and shouted, “Who are you? What do you want?”

The rat demon grasped the old man’s arm and said, “It’s me, coming from Tongguan Mountain. I have some kinship with you, ancestor.”

The old man ohed but didn’t reject the rat demon’s eager support. After walking a few steps, he suddenly stopped, sniffed, and widened his eyes, radiating a sharp gleam. There was no trace of his previous frailty; he looked around and said sternly, “Something’s off! There’s a human scent; it must be human! What a fine fellow, so sneaky, hiding so deep that I almost didn’t notice.”

The rat demon trembled, nearly collapsing to the ground.

So, it turned out that all along, a legendary young sword immortal had been tailing it?

The old man exclaimed, “He ran away?”

The old man shouted angrily at his disciples, “You worthless fools! You didn’t even notice the tail! If those filthy creatures sent spies and ruined our mountain-water array, you wouldn’t be able to pay with a hundred lives!”

The rat demon completely lost its strength, sitting on the ground, its face pale. Fortunately, it didn’t forget the main matter and recounted everything that had happened on Tongguan Mountain.

The old man’s expression shifted unpredictably.

This half-dead old man held an impressive identity; he was one of the six saints, self-proclaimed as the Demon Capturer.

As a spirit being with a demon-binding rope around his waist, the rope concealed two dragon whiskers from the thousand-year silver carp of Tonglu Lake. Capturing ordinary spirits and demons was effortless for him, and once an enemy was bound, they would be torn apart and crushed into pieces, as he relished the texture of such flesh, claiming that the blood that dripped out had a taste of wine.

Suddenly, the old man removed the demon-binding rope and threw it out. It twisted and slithered like a snake, and moments later, it zipped back, captured in the old man’s hand. “Indeed, he has run away.”

The old man rode the clouds and mist, no longer strolling leisurely, swiftly heading towards the cave that the mountain-moving monkey had opened.

Dozens of miles away, Chen Ping'an, appearing with a youthful visage, moved swiftly through the mountain forest.

It wasn’t that he was retreating in defeat, but he had changed his mind at the last minute.

Earlier, he had followed the rat demon to the mountain top of the mountain-moving great sage, where he caught sight of a group of spirit beings. They had tied up a living human—a weak, scholarly young man, whose hands and feet were bound to a bamboo pole, carried on the shoulders of two not-quite-human thugs, swaying as they walked. The poor scholar was left gasping for breath.

At the forefront was a spirit being resembling a gentleman, dressed in scholarly attire, exuding an air of elegance, carrying a white bone folding fan with a peach blossom painted on the surface, fanning himself slowly.

Beside him was an elderly man with goat-like whiskers, chatting casually. They had come specifically to fetch this young man, the one with the peach blossom fan, being a trusted aide of their summer-dwelling lady, frequently able to lure living humans from the copper-smelling city to provide her with better meals.

The old man chuckled, “Sir, scholars are indeed rare and valuable; they must taste exquisite. How did you capture him? Share the details.”

The scholarly spirit being chuckled with pride, slowly explaining, “It took quite a bit of effort. This hotheaded youth was wandering the mountains near the copper-smelling city. I struck up a conversation about poetry and prose, and after a delightful exchange, I tricked him into leaving the territory of the copper-smelling city, ensuring he wouldn’t cause us any trouble. Even if the copper-smelling city figures it out later, I won’t be at fault.”

The weak scholar trembled, “I’m the newly appointed scholar from the copper-smelling city; you can’t eat me! Please don’t! If the summer-dwelling lady truly wants to eat someone, I can help. I can lure a few more people back for you—woodcutters from the mountains, or those women who admire my talent, anything will do…”

The scholarly spirit being sneered, “Can we trust the words of a scholar? Look at you; you believed me, and look what happened!”

The scholar silently shed tears.

The copper-smelling city near Qinglu Town was quite unique, where living people and spirits coexisted, managing to coexist peacefully despite being a hodgepodge of people and ghosts. Compared to the other cities in Ghostly Marsh Valley, the copper-smelling city was the most stable, with few fierce ghosts and demons around. This was closely related to Qinglu Town, specifically to the immortal teacher Zhu Quan.

Moreover, there were over twenty thousand living humans in the mortal world, rooted there for generations. They were originally a group of exiled cultivators from a destroyed sect who had sought refuge and ended up making a large payment to the spirits, allowing them to thrive for centuries. Eventually, many descendants settled comfortably in and around the city, and more loose cultivators gathered there, similar to the common folk near the mountain peaks of the immortal realm, coexisting with the spirits and demons, becoming a norm.

However, the living people near the copper-smelling city often had short lifespans, usually not living beyond fifty years. Even those who were long-lived were still considered old by the time they reached that age. The mortal women of the copper-smelling city, despite having no cultivation talent, were stunningly beautiful, yet their beauty faded quickly, often showing signs of aging by the time they reached twenty-five, which was quite a pity.

Each year, the copper-smelling city would select a batch of young and beautiful girls, meticulously trained by caretakers, and sent to other cities to serve as concubines or maids in influential households as a means of gaining favor.

The city lord of the copper-smelling city had a sister, equally famous, who would occasionally toss money from the city walls on the first and fifteenth of each month, sometimes mixed with one or two small summer coins.

There was also a Golden Luan Hall in the copper-smelling city, with a small court where the city lord had appointed over a hundred civil and military officials, fully equipped with all six departments, albeit small in scale. Every ten days, they would hold court sessions, resembling a proper assembly.

They even had a civil examination, but there were no local tests or examinations; only the palace examination, as the city was simply too small, with few educated individuals.

The city lord’s sister had even proclaimed herself as the “Chief Chancellor of Examinations,” personally overseeing the examination questions and grading.

The scholarly spirit being, who had proclaimed himself a “gentleman,” continued to chat with the old man with goat-like whiskers about the recent happenings in the northern part of Ghostly Marsh Valley.

This scholarly spirit, having returned from a journey, had heard some sensational rumors from the copper-smelling city, with contents that were quite exaggerated yet seemed credible.

He initially planned to show off a little when he met the summer-dwelling lady, but feeling too stifled during the long journey, he began to speak, “I heard that two incredibly beautiful female cultivators from outside came along; one of them is likely the deer-riding goddess from the mural city. They took a ferry, heedless of danger, daring to head straight for Jingguan City. Their momentum was so strong that not a single city lord dared to stop them along the way. It wasn’t until they neared Jingguan City that a city lord used the city’s heavy defensive weapon, launching at least a hundred flying swords.”

The old man with goat-like whiskers exclaimed, “Goodness, if it were us, we would’ve been turned into a sieve by now!”

“Just you? Do you know how much divine money is consumed every time the sword platform fires in a volley? If it were our lady, only then would there be such a treatment,” the scholarly spirit being replied with a chuckle.

“Back to the main subject, just when the situation became critical, unexpectedly, an ugly flower protector, claiming to be Zhou Fei, appeared. True to his name, he looked quite dreadful, yet his abilities were impressive. He directly cast a large net, rumored to be made from thousands of snowflake coins. In short, he collected all those flying swords, which buzzed around like they were stuffed into a large bag of mosquitoes. The city wasn’t satisfied and sent another wave of flying swords; guess what happened?”

One thug casually blurted out, “They ran away, what else?”

The scholarly spirit being kicked him, sending him flying several feet, then continued on his own, “That ugly man waved out another identical net, still crafted from divine money, claiming he had no other talents, but he was particularly skilled at making money while lying down. He himself was scared of it! An ugly fellow like him, if he weren’t so hideous, I might even be tempted to urinate on his head.”

The crowd of demons erupted in astonished chatter.

They felt as if they were hearing a celestial tale.

The old man with goat-like whiskers asked softly, “What happened afterward? Did it turn into a more intense fight in Jingguan City? Would they fight to the death, perishing together? That would be perfect!”

“Old Goat, you look a bit like Zhou Fei; don’t think too highly of yourself,” the scholarly spirit being teased before feeling a little regretful, “There’s nothing much afterward. Many of the vassal cities in the north near Jingguan City have started to go into lockdown, and no further news has leaked to our southern side. This is all the information I have about the copper-smelling city. Alas, those two young ladies are likely walking into a tiger’s den. No matter how powerful that ugly man’s treasures are, can they match the cultivation of the city lord of Jingguan City?”

Chen Ping'an followed from a distance.

He was puzzled about why Jiang Shangzhen had returned to North Jiu Lu and why he had to team up with that deer-riding goddess from the mural to charge into Jingguan City in Ghostly Marsh Valley.

Could it be that after the deer-riding goddess encountered setbacks at the Shake River ferry, she turned to Jiang Shangzhen for support?

As for the other female cultivator accompanying them, who could she be?

Regardless of these questions, it was not his place to meddle. If Jiang Shangzhen truly acted against Jingguan City, it would be a real celestial fight.

First, he needed to meet the summer-dwelling lady.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 569: The Celestial Jade Capital (Part Two)

In a deep ravine halfway up Treasure Mirror Mountain, Yang Chongxuan sat by the water, feeling utterly bored. He rubbed his cheeks, reflecting on the many years he had spent here, waiting for opportunities. The monotony was becoming unbearable.

Once he secured his chance, he definitely wanted to head north for a change of scenery, preferably to the Forging Mountain (Dili Mountain) to have a good fight with someone. After years of remaining low-key, he felt overshadowed by many rising stars.

Yang Chongxuan scratched his head; having grown accustomed to his baldness over the years, he was now a bit uncomfortable with it. Was that prophecy accurate? Although staying here could be considered a form of cultivation—taking regular baths in the water to temper his soul—it was nothing compared to the days he spent honing his body in the volcanic magma. Besides, he wasn't one to enjoy restrictions. If it weren't for his family's strict orders, with his mother almost resorting to the virtue of filial piety to pressure him, he wouldn't have bothered with this trip at all. Surely it would have been better to leave it to his capable, stable, and famous younger brother? After all, even if he obtained that Three Mountain Mirror (San Shan Jing), the family would ultimately hand it over to his brother to refine into his life treasure.

He wasn't resentful about it, nor did he begrudge his brother's success; he just found it painfully dull to be stuck on this desolate Treasure Mirror Mountain. This was also one of the reasons the old fox from the West Mountain could thrive—having a bit of fun helped ease the boredom.

With a casual flick of his hand, he grabbed a handful of stones from the white cliff and crushed them into tiny pebbles before tossing them into the water. 

He and that well-known younger brother didn't exactly get along; they simply had clashing personalities, but it wasn't to the point of becoming enemies. As the older brother, Yang Chongxuan couldn't stand how his brother had always acted mature for someone his age, like a bookworm. In contrast, his younger brother had never liked him, the troublemaker.

If their positions were reversed, life would have been much simpler. 

If only he had known back then, when he accidentally arrived in this world first, he would have crawled back to his mother if he could manage it. 

Sighing, Yang Chongxuan looked northward and lamented, "Oh, my dear mother, when will these hard days come to an end?"

Just then, a burly young man burst out from the nearby forest, excitement radiating from him as he cradled a large bundle of wild fruits picked from another mountain. "Brother Yang, are you missing mother too?" 

Yang Chongxuan propped his chin on his hand, too lethargic to respond. He was already exhausted every single day. 

The young man leaped over the ravine and landed beside Yang Chongxuan, offering him a wild fruit. "Brother Yang, this thing is so crunchy and delicious!"

Yang Chongxuan accepted the pear-like wild fruit and bit into it, mumbling, "Wei Gaowu, does your sister have a secret lover?"

The burly man, Wei Gaowu, was the younger son of the old fox from the West Mountain, known as Wei Taizhen, the Umbrella Fox. Of course, the names they carried were not their real birth names. 

Wei Gaowu shook his head. "Of course not! My sister has high standards. Just look, she hasn’t even taken a liking to you, Brother Yang. It seems she’s destined to be an old maid for life."

Yang Chongxuan decided not to pry further. 

This seemingly simple-minded giant had grown accustomed to being bullied among the mountain spirits around Treasure Mirror Mountain, merely a flag-bearing lackey easily cowed by others. If he weren’t so unattractive, he’d probably be treated much better. 

But Wei Gaowu was not stupid. 

In fact, one could say he was the smartest among his family of three. 

He had done everything he could, and refrained from what he shouldn’t have done. 

Yet, he still couldn't change his sister's fate. 

Yang Chongxuan was curious; when the day came, would Wei Gaowu still be able to play the fool, or would he desperately fight back? Would he endure humiliation in the Ghost Gully (Gui Yu Valley), struggling to survive while hoping for revenge against Yang Chongxuan in the future? 

This was also one of Yang Chongxuan's ways to alleviate his boredom—thinking about his minor troubles and others' major tragedies could be quite entertaining. 

He took another wild fruit, wiped it on his tattered sleeve, and casually asked, "What’s the gossip from Powdered Wolf City (Fenlang City)?" 

Wei Gaowu chuckled, "After the city lord spoke with you last time, I saw him at the dilapidated temple, and he praised me for being fortunate to know a hero like you, Brother Yang! He even invited me to visit Powdered Wolf City!"

Yang Chongxuan smiled. "That means the city lord is quite easy to talk to."

Wei Gaowu grinned, "I know! It’s still thanks to you, Brother Yang. Otherwise, the city lord wouldn’t even spare me a glance; he’d think I’m filthy!"

Yang Chongxuan asked, "Any interesting news from other places lately?"

Wei Gaowu was just a messenger sent to gather information, and although the fox spirit appeared timid, possibly never having shown anger, he was quite daring, often venturing to nearby mountains, Powdered Wolf City, and even Lan She Town. However, Wei Gaowu only interacted with the lowest tier of spirits, demons, and rogue cultivators in Ghost Gully. Yang Chongxuan could easily imagine Wei Gaowu’s usual submissive demeanor, always bowing and grinning.

Wei Gaowu nodded. "There is some news. I just returned from Lan She Town. It’s said that there was a fierce battle at Forging Mountain recently. That Liu Jinglong, who you find particularly annoying, fought against a stunning foreign Taoist priestess there, and it turned into a tremendous clash!"

Yang Chongxuan said, "Liu Jinglong actually dared to fight? And he chose a high-profile place like Forging Mountain? How many moves did he take to kill her?"

Wei Gaowu whispered, "Both sides were gravely injured, lying in a pool of blood for a long while before they could get up. In the end, Liu Jinglong barely won, because he was the first to stand up; the Taoist took a bit longer."

Yang Chongxuan frowned. 

Liu Jinglong had a bigger reputation than his brother. 

In the competitive North Julu Continent, everyone loved to rank their strengths, and that made the battles even more brutal. 

Among the ten at the peak of the mountains, including the Celestial Lord Xie Shizai, Liu Jinglong ranked third. 

He was also praised as the Earthly Dragon of North Julu, a sure future candidate for one of the top ten in the continent. 

Yang Chongxuan was annoyed with him because, during a private duel in their youth, he could never break through a simple formation Liu Jinglong had set up. 

It’s worth noting that Liu Jinglong was a sword cultivator, not a formation master. 

Moreover, what irritated Yang Chongxuan even more was that Liu Jinglong was always keen on lecturing others—not on lofty, ethereal theories, but on the most basic principles, which only made Yang Chongxuan feel even more frustrated.

Yang Chongxuan chuckled, "After this battle, I suppose Qionglin Sect made quite a bit of money."

Wei Gaowu’s curiosity was piqued. "Brother Yang, what kind of sect is Qionglin Sect?"

Yang Chongxuan replied, "That copper-smelling city of yours in Ghost Gully is quite the money-maker, but if you see Qionglin Sect, you’d better kneel and pay your respects."

Wei Gaowu looked somewhat dazed, honestly holding those wild fruits and squatting beside Yang Chongxuan, gazing into the distance. 

Yang Chongxuan said, "There are always bigger mountains beyond the mountains, and heavens beyond the heavens, but if you’re not strong enough, no matter where you go, you’ll just be Wei Gaowu from Ghost Gully; aside from being a bit taller, there’s nothing special about you. There’s no need to yearn for anything out there; you might as well stay in Ghost Gully and take it easy."

Wei Gaowu softly called, "Brother Yang."

Yang Chongxuan patted the big guy’s shoulder, "Scram."

Wei Gaowu sighed heavily, gently placing the wild fruits aside, and leaped across the ravine, heading off. As he reached the edge of the dense forest on the other side, the big guy turned around and waved goodbye.

Yang Chongxuan extended his hand, lightly opening his mouth to spit out a drop of scarlet liquid the size of a grain of rice. He chuckled, shaking his head; Wei Gaowu really wasn’t clever enough.

He didn’t even know whether he was a Qi cultivator or just a martial artist, yet he dared to play around with these tricks? 

But Wei Gaowu would definitely never guess the truth, not even if given two chances. 

Was he a Qi cultivator? 

Was he purely a martial artist? 

Because Yang Chongxuan was both, and he had achieved great heights in both. 

This was thanks to his earlier duel with Liu Jinglong; at that time, they were peers and somewhat friends. 

That encounter had changed Yang Chongxuan, who was naturally carefree and laid-back.

Yang Chongxuan was just a pseudonym. 

The wandering hero "Yang Jinshan" was also a fake name. 

However, the name Yang Chongxuan was likely forgotten by all, while the wandering hero Yang Jinshan and the nickname "Yang the Butcher" were widely known, far more famous than his real name across the continent.

His younger brother, who also had innate Dao roots, was naturally drawn to water, while he, as the elder brother, was drawn to the mountains. 

So, the family still sent him to Treasure Mirror Mountain. 

Did they really come up with such a ridiculous reason? 

What was this seemingly bottomless ravine anyway? 

Yang Chongxuan clapped his hands, leaning back, and aside from that absurd reasoning, there was a more profound interpretation. 

His water-loving younger brother might very well encounter a life-and-death struggle for the Dao here at Treasure Mirror Mountain, which could be very dangerous. 

Yang Chongxuan found it hard to believe that in Ghost Gully, unless the city lord of Jingguan City and that crazy bone man went insane, what danger could his brother possibly face? His brother wasn’t some soft persimmon; he was a slippery eel. Ordinary Core Formation cultivators would hardly be able to catch him, especially given his talent for self-preservation and fleeing. 

The Shi Family’s Zhu Quan wasn’t stupid and might even help protect him. The two ascended masters from Xiaoxuandu Temple and Dayuan Moon Temple were not troublemakers, particularly the one from Xiaoxuandu Temple, who might even take a liking to his brother—wasn’t that another small but significant good fortune? 

All those prophecies and mysterious sayings made him feel bored. 

Suddenly, Yang Chongxuan remembered that young wanderer wearing a bamboo hat. 

It was obvious they were of the same kind. 

Yet, at that moment, Yang Chongxuan had no intention of competing with him. 

An opportunity was near. 

Old sayings like "Better to do less than do more" were still worth heeding. 

Could it be this person? 

Yang Chongxuan began to contemplate, forming hand seals and silently calculating, deducing a matter. Although he had learned to be dismissive, he was still stronger than most high-level practitioners, thanks to his family background. 

Just moments later, Yang Chongxuan leaned back, closed his eyes, and began to sleep, muttering, "What does it matter to me? Even with the sun high in the sky, I still sleep, indifferent to the world's troubles."

Yang Chongxuan murmured, "Still envious of that Fire Dragon, who cultivates whether awake or asleep. I wonder if there are any similar celestial techniques in the world; if there are, I must steal and learn them."

A rich voice sounded beside Yang Chongxuan, "There are indeed. One in Liuxia Continent can achieve enlightenment in dreams, making his cultivation remarkably efficient. Now this person has come to North Julu, and if I’m not mistaken, it’s because he obtained the opportunity from the goddess of the hanging ink painting in Wall Painting City."

"As for another person, the events surrounding him are somewhat related to a certain ancestor of mine, so I know he hails from the Pearl Continent’s Liuzhu Cave Heaven. However, he is now in the Southern Posa Continent, able to practice swordsmanship in daydreams. As long as he doesn’t meet an untimely end, he can expect a bright future. Yet, between these two, there will inevitably be a grand competition for the Dao."

Yang Chongxuan didn’t open his eyes and smiled, "So it's the Grandmaster visiting. Are you here to compete with a junior for opportunities? That wouldn't be right, would it? Just a mirror that reveals the true nature of demons, does the old master have an eye for it too?"

An old Taoist sat cross-legged near Yang Chongxuan. Without using any spiritual energy, he merely willed it, and the mist from the deep ravine coalesced into a mat.

He was the old master of Xiaoxuandu Temple.

The old Taoist didn’t respond to Yang Chongxuan’s somewhat rude question; instead, he gazed into the deep ravine, expressing, "Observing this water, I still feel the boundless wonders of creation, truly unfathomable."

Yang Chongxuan sat up and sighed, "I never thought I’d rely on my family’s status one day to find some peace of mind."

The old Taoist chuckled, "Your parents are powerful, so even your own birth is a significant affair; that’s nothing to be ashamed of. Why should you be so troubled, young friend?"

Yang Chongxuan grinned, "Master, let me make it clear beforehand. I only hope you won’t compete with me for the opportunity of this Treasure Mirror. As for any good deeds like teaching techniques or forming good relations, my younger brother might welcome them, but as for me, please refrain. I won’t accept them."

The old Taoist laughed heartily, "I find you even more interesting than your brother."

Yang Chongxuan clasped his hands behind his head, "Let’s consider that a compliment."

In the central region of North Julu, there was the largest dynasty, which had a Chongxuan Bureau overseeing various sects in the capital, managing the records of Taoist priests and the rites, as well as temple affairs and the genealogies of all monks.

The head of the Chongxuan Bureau was a man named Yang, who was not only the national master but also owned the Cloud Palace, with three ancestors who had reached the Fifth Realm, all of whom had passed away.

Cloud Palace was a Taoist ancestral forest, similar to Longhu Mountain’s Heavenly Master’s residence.

Its power and deep heritage were unimaginable. 

Among the younger generation, there were two talented brothers, both of whom were praised as born Dao seeds since childhood. 

One was favored by Celestial Lord Xie Shizai. Although he couldn’t take him as a disciple, the young man still received teachings from Xie Shizai. The other, despite being the elder brother, loved to wander and was elusive. Rumor had it he had dual pupils, benefiting from both being born first and possessing an extra phenomenon. He should have been the rightful heir, yet due to his scatterbrained nature, he became increasingly obscure, with the family’s pleas falling on deaf ears.

As time passed, the former gradually became the inevitable candidate to be the next Feathered Clothes Minister under the Chongxuan Bureau. The latter was overshadowed by his brother’s immense reputation, becoming even more silent and nameless.

The old Taoist raised his head, gazing into the distance, likely toward the entrance of Ghost Gully, then shifted his gaze toward Lan She Town, smiling, "I’ve come to tell you that an opportunity has arrived."

Yang Chongxuan remained unmoved. "Why has the master come to tell me this?"

The old Taoist’s expression grew serious as he slowly said, "I calculated an omen earlier, and it turned out to be one of great fortune in killing. However, blessings and misfortunes coexist, which left me a bit unsettled. A flaw appeared between my heart and the Dao. Ultimately, I chose to let it go to someone else. Now that I’ve relieved this burden, I feel my original intent has been preserved, yet I also feel a sense of loss, as if I’ve missed an opportunity."

Yang Chongxuan sneered, "So, you mean the master wants to use me as a knife to kill? To stay clean while I become the scapegoat? Even if I could kill someone whom even you hesitate to deal with, the price would be too high. Can my little arms and legs bear that?"

The old Taoist shook his head, "You are not one of the born Dao seeds from the Qingming Heavenly Realm, which are exceedingly rare. That’s why I left Xiaoxuandu Temple to speak with you."

The old Taoist stood up, "Take care of yourself."

Yang Chongxuan suddenly asked, "I have a question I don’t understand, and I hope the master can clarify."

The old Taoist nodded, "Speak freely."

Yang Chongxuan asked, "The ones who need to understand the Dao the most are precisely those who cannot accept it. Those willing to listen to reason often don’t need it. What should we do?"

The old Taoist smiled, "This is a problem for the Confucian disciples to ponder. As for you, overthinking is a burden; why seek unnecessary troubles? There are many foolish people in the world who disturb themselves and take pleasure in it. Why bother waking them from their sweet dreams? If they call you noisy, consider it their good temper. Those with narrow minds will see you as an enemy. In that case, who is truly foolish, them or us?"

Yang Chongxuan was left speechless, standing up and, for the first time, bowing deeply, "Thank you for your enlightening words, Master."

Yang Chongxuan then blurted out a heartfelt statement, "In the pursuit of the Dao, one seeks the truth."

The old Taoist showed a hint of appreciation, gently nodding before vanishing.

Yang Chongxuan regained his senses, spread his hands, clenched his fists, "The strong forge their paths, cutting through thorns, while the weak follow blindly, content with their circumstances."

He rubbed his chin, and after a moment's pause, he couldn’t hold back a chuckle, which was quite a feat. 

That problem he wouldn’t have cared about was actually the crux of Liu Jinglong’s struggles over the years. 

However, the old Taoist from Xiaoxuandu Temple’s answer was unexpected and certainly deserved a bow of gratitude. 

Returning to the Peach Grove, the old Taoist didn't rush to the temple. 

Walking under the peach trees, he kept his head tilted back, gazing at the sky. 

That young wanderer, for whatever reason, had declined the invitation to the temple for tea, but that didn’t mean it was the end. 

Thus, the old Taoist would ask that old monk friend if he needed to keep that cup of thousand-year peach nectar tea.

In truth, such matters didn’t require an outsider like the old monk to decide in Xiaoxuandu Temple. 

The old monk had merely said four words at the time: "Too much talk leads to loss."

This made the old Taoist realize something and immediately become alert. 

After making a final decision, the old Taoist returned to the state of pure tranquility, but the more he extrapolated, the more he felt something was off. With his current cultivation, even if the city lord of Ghost Gully entered a life-and-death struggle, it wouldn't disturb his Dao heart in the slightest. The old Taoist then used what could be called a unique divine ability, expending a great deal of true essence, sacrificing decades of cultivation just to use the ancient divine technique of observing the world, eventually finding a thread of clues. 

At both ends of a single line, one was with He Xiaoliang in Jingguan City, and the other with that young man. 

This was already strange enough, but even more shocking was a line that connected He Xiaoliang to the outside world, leading directly to the sky of North Julu, seemingly connected to someone from another realm! 

This left the already pure-hearted old Taoist drenched in cold sweat, filled with rage. 

Who was He Xiaoliang's master? Why could a foreign female cultivator from the Pearl Continent rise so rapidly in North Julu, establishing her own sect with the full support of Celestial Lord Xie Shizai?! In North Julu, who among the true peaks was unaware of her name? 

The old Taoist glared up, wishing he could immediately rush to that realm, to the Celestial Jade Capital, and demand an explanation from the leader. 

Once he followed the omen to kill, the blessings might not be false. 

But did you think I, Lu Chen, was just a puppet? A dog begging at someone else’s doorstep?!

### In the Celestial Jade Capital

A young Taoist sat lazily on a jade balcony, beneath his feet a sea of clouds varying in height, all brimming with abundant spiritual energy. He smiled and said, "Both Xiaoxuandu Temples have quite the methods."

Previously, he had been tilting his head, his fingers idly twisting a thin thread, listening intently, albeit intermittently, to a vague and unclear sound. 

That thread was something he wasn’t keen to touch himself. 

At this moment, he straightened his posture and flicked his fingers, carelessly breaking the thread. 

It was merely a simple game of tracing roots, and he did not harbor any ulterior motives. Whether that young man was alive or dead, whether he was in fortune or misfortune, he wouldn’t wade into murky waters. Instead, it was He Xiaoliang who had acted on her own accord, creating a mess that she was unaware of the consequences. Therefore, that little cow's nose from Xiaoxuandu Temple was framed by Lu Chen. He would keep that account pinned on the Xiaoxuandu Temple and later go there to throw a fit. He would curse the place for a whole day until he got justice.

Lu Chen rubbed his chin, muttering to himself, "But my little disciple is indeed quite fortunate. Without even striking a blow, he almost killed that young man by accident."

A young man, not wearing the Taoist robe or crown from the original three lineages, approached Lu Chen and asked, "Third Senior Brother, any fresh news?"

Lu Chen turned around and patted the young man's head, "Little Junior Brother, you must strive hard. Don’t let me lose to that Qi again; I hold grudges, you know?"

The young man’s smile stiffened. Seeing Lu Chen’s teasing grin, he immediately turned and fled. 

But in this realm, in the Celestial Jade Capital, where could the boy possibly run to? 

Sure enough, it seemed he was caught by an unseen hand, pulling him by the collar and tossing him out of the Celestial Jade Capital into the sea of clouds. Not only that, but his spiritual energy was also restrained.

Several immortals immediately swooped out from various places in the Celestial Jade Capital, trying to catch this esteemed new Junior Uncle. 

Lu Chen swatted them away one by one as they attempted to save the boy. 

The young man fell rapidly. 

An ascended cultivator temporarily assigned to protect him gritted his teeth, about to brave the danger to save him. Did he really want to watch the young man crash to the ground? 

Relying solely on physical strength, even a Jade Purity Realm cultivator would become a puddle of mush upon hitting the ground. 

Those clouds were no ordinary matter. 

Naturally, the Dao Ancestor could save this disciple of his, as could the Master of Lu, but what about this protector? Would he become the laughingstock of the entire realm? 

Lu Chen shot a cold glance at the ascended cultivator, who immediately felt their resolve falter, hastily standing still to steady their mind. 

Just as the young man was about to hit the ground, two massive holes simultaneously tore open in the sky, creating a great commotion. 

Then two streaks of rainbow light shot toward the Celestial Jade Capital. 

Although the holes quickly sealed themselves, in that brief moment, several shadows rushed into the Qingming Heavenly Realm, deliberately avoiding the Celestial Jade Capital, trying to conceal themselves. 

Lu Chen remained expressionless, extending his hand to count down. 

As those shadows dashed in various directions, immense golden-armored divine beings appeared out of nowhere, smashing the shadows apart. 

Lu Chen lightly leaped, instantly arriving at the foot of the Celestial Jade Capital. 

The young man was suspended just a foot above the ground, his limbs stiff, his mind empty. 

Lu Chen crouched down and slowly said, "The protector is an external matter, and the identity of the Dao Ancestor's disciple is also an external matter; your life and death is still an external matter."

The young man, sweating, nodded. 

Lu Chen pressed down on the young man's head, gently pushing it down, and in an instant, the Dao Ancestor's disciple turned into a puddle of mush. 

Lu Chen smiled, "Unless you truly die once, how can you truly know... the Dao?" 

A tall middle-aged Taoist appeared beside Lu Chen, waving his sleeve to gather the young man's soul into it, frowning, "Is this how you treat your senior brother?" 

Lu Chen grinned, "Better than how you treated me back in the day." 

The tall Taoist shook his head, stomping his foot, rising into the sky toward the Celestial Jade Capital’s highest point. 

Suddenly, Lu Chen grabbed someone by the neck; the disheveled fellow appeared to be a bit short and had to stand on his toes to not feel out of place beside Lu Chen. He grinned mischievously and asked, "How was that punch I threw just now? Was the angle tricky enough? I bet Dao Lao Er is still feeling sore from that." 

Lu Chen nodded, "Still maintaining your style." 

The man applied more pressure, causing Lu Chen to lean back slightly. He squinted and asked, "Should we settle some old scores?" 

Lu Chen chuckled, "I won’t be going to the Outer Heaven; if we fight here, without a sword, you can’t hurt me. Besides, how many fairies from the Celestial Jade Capital are watching us right now?" 

Only then did the man release his grip. Lu Chen dusted himself off, feeling a bit helpless. 

The man faced the towering Celestial Jade Capital, squinting intensely, then suddenly spat into his palm, rubbing his hands together before raising them high and raking through his hair from front to back. 

He felt that if he had a mirror in his hands right now, it would probably shatter on the spot. 

Clearing his throat a few times, he prepared to speak. 

Lu Chen, exasperated, said, "No need for self-introductions; everyone in the Celestial Jade Capital already knows you as Ah Liang." 

The man still seriously introduced himself to the fairies of the Celestial Jade Capital, "Kind-hearted Liang." 

Lu Chen inquired, "Since you insist on being a swordsman, where’s your sword?" 

The man retorted, "Must a swordsman always have a sword?" 

He answered himself, "I think not." 

Lu Chen nodded, "Wherever there is chivalry in the world, there will be a swift draw of the sword. I know your intentions; if you succeed, it will indeed be spectacular." 

That short yet unremarkable man stomped his foot and shot up, but he didn’t head toward the Celestial Jade Capital in search of Dao Lao Er; instead, he punched through the sky, returning to the Outer Heaven. 

Lu Chen stood with his hands behind his back, gazing up, reluctant to look away. 

Some people, regardless of whether they are friends or foes, evoke a sense of admiration in others. 

In this respect, Ah Liang was actually better than both himself and Qi Jingchun. 

Suddenly, Lu Chen recalled something and smiled knowingly. 

Perhaps that lady from the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven wouldn’t think so. 

--- 

The Summer Avoidance Goddess's cave was built on a mountain known as the Falling Mountain, which wasn’t particularly high and didn’t boast great feng shui. 

She was originally the weakest among the Six Saints but, for some unknown reason, the Falling Mountain remained steadfast in Ghost Gully. 

In contrast, the Mountain Moving Great Saint not only had a strong army under him but also possessed a cultivation level far greater than hers. 

The Mountain Moving Great Saint was a hybrid mountain ape, only five hundred years old, yet he thrived on his naturally robust physique, reveling in close combat with demons or Qi practitioners. He had also paid a hefty sum to acquire a highly prized Ganyun Armor and wielded a pair of immensely powerful meteor hammers, making him even more formidable. 

The defenses of Falling Mountain were sparse, with a few spirits huddled together, preoccupied with gambling, completely unfocused. 

However, Falling Mountain had three cleverly crafted interlinked water and mountain prohibitions. While they weren't protective formations, any outsider who rashly intruded would easily trigger them, alarming the entire Falling Mountain. 

The residence displayed a plaque reading "Palace of Vast Cold," crafted in splendid gold and jade, exuding a festive opulence, and likely cost quite a fortune. The grounds were also adorned with numerous osmanthus trees, though none were particularly rare or exotic. 

In the back courtyard, a graceful woman with a face full of pits stood on the steps. Dressed in an elegant palace gown, she noticed a scholar hanging on a bamboo pole and her eyes brightened. Her cheeks puffed as she smiled broadly, eagerly wiping her drool. Before the spirit holding the fan could even take credit, she shooed him and all the annoying underlings away. 

The bamboo pole was set down, and the scholar, in an awkward position, lay on the ground, his wrist marked with bruises. He struggled to speak, his voice trembling, "Summer Avoidance Goddess?" 

The woman crouched down, brushing her fingers across the scholar's face, her gaze dreamy. "I haven’t seen such a handsome man in ages. How delightful! Little boy, don’t worry; I'm a woman who knows how to be gentle. Don’t listen to the nonsense outside, saying the Summer Avoidance Goddess prefers deep frying over steaming; that’s all rubbish. My method of consuming men is the most divine; every man will enjoy it immensely. This Falling Mountain is no dragon’s den or tiger’s lair; it’s truly a paradise for you men." 

In her words, the woman couldn’t help but let out a long, wide, peculiar tongue, and saliva dripped from the corners of her mouth onto the scholar’s face. 

The scholar looked on, wanting to cry but unable to shed tears. 

It seemed he was struck dumb, staring blankly at her. 

The Summer Avoidance Goddess laughed seductively, "What are you staring at? Don’t be impatient; once I untie you, we’ll head to the love seat together. You’ll see everything." 

The scholar slowly said, "You toad really aren’t exaggerating; you truly are from the Moon Palace; I don’t regret coming here." 

The woman was momentarily taken aback. 

In an instant, black smoke engulfed her, a murderous aura rising to the heavens, shrouding the Summer Avoidance Goddess in its depths. After a series of frantic, mournful cries, she quickly fell silent, leaving behind a pool of blood blossoming on the ground. 

Moments later, the scene transformed into the scholar squatting on the ground while the Summer Avoidance Goddess lay there, now just a skeleton. 

The scholar, bloodied lips untouched, burped with satisfaction, dipping his hand into the blood before turning his gaze toward the wall, smiling, "Did you enjoy the show?" 

Even Chen Ping'an was taken aback. 

Seeing this man consuming spirits and demons was not uncommon, nor was it unusual for fox spirits to toy with scholars. 

But witnessing a "scholar" devour a demon was a first for Chen Ping'an. 

Chen Ping'an squatted atop the wall, having re-hung his sword gourd at his waist, asking, "This Summer Avoidance Goddess, with her mediocre cultivation, clearly has a powerful backing. It won't be one of the other major demons, are you not afraid?" 

The scholar chuckled, "Isn’t it just right that you came to be the scapegoat?" 

Chen Ping'an also laughed, "Can’t you show a bit of chivalry?" 

From the sword gourd, the lightning flickered out, not entangling the scholar but instead vanishing into the ground. 

Having learned from experience, Chen Ping'an vividly remembered the cart of Fan Yunlu that burrowed underground. 

Both fell into silence. 

The scholar should be wary of this young swordsman, who had already gained notoriety in the southern part of Ghost Gully. 

Yet the scholar knew one thing. 

This guy had a heavy killing intent. 

It even overshadowed the sword's aura! 

The scholar thought it was fine; why not let loose and engage in a fight? 

Killing and seizing treasures, one must seek fortune through danger; he had been quite lucky in life and had never lost! 

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, shook his head, then patted his chest, grinning brightly, "Sorry, I’m a bit squeamish around blood." 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 570: The Depth of the Immortal Clan

The two figures at the Summer Retreat Lady's residence in the Crumbling Mountain felt as if they had stepped into an unpredictable chess game.

Three choices lay before them: they could engage in a fierce battle to the death, with only one party benefitting, potentially leading to the demise of the loser; one side could concede, such as Chen Ping'an choosing to bear the consequences of killing the Summer Retreat Lady, or the scholar might take advantage without implicating Chen Ping'an; or they could both take a step back, leaving the chessboard of Crumbling Mountain together, where one would speak of martial ethics while the other would advocate for harmony and profit, redirecting their focus toward the other five monsters.

Chen Ping'an asked, "You aren't a monster? You're a shade from the Ghostly Abyss, right?"

The scholar brushed off his sleeves and replied, somewhat irritated, "I’m a living person, a true embodiment of pure Yang energy, no doubt about it. The earlier methods I used to subdue demons were merely tricks to startle you. You can’t wander the martial world without some means to conceal your identity."

Chen Ping'an inquired, "So, are we forming an alliance? Shall we go find that Pi Chen Yuan Jun and give him some trouble together?"

The scholar's gaze turned peculiar.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the white bones of the Summer Retreat Lady on the ground and suddenly understood; he was the one who had been careless, giving away hints about his own identity. 

Since the Summer Retreat Lady was dead, this Crumbling Mountain residence must contain some valuable assets. It made no sense to enter a treasure mountain and leave empty-handed; clearly, this was not a practitioner skilled in thievery.

Shifting the topic, Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "You seem to have a lot of schemes in mind. You must be familiar with the treasures hidden in this Glorious Cold Palace. How about we split the harvest fifty-fifty?"

The scholar shook his head, "In this Crumbling Mountain, it’s more like seventy-thirty. You get three, I take seven. You’re merely sitting on the sidelines watching the show; three parts is more than enough. After we deal with the other monsters, we can decide based on each other's abilities and contributions."

Chen Ping'an countered, "Forty-sixty."

The scholar hesitated, finally revealing a pained expression. He pointed to the skeleton on the ground, saying, "The white bones of this Summer Retreat Lady, while not the kind of jade bones associated with ghosts, have absorbed the essence of the sun and moon for nearly a thousand years in the Ghostly Abyss. They have been refined to the point of surpassing the golden branches and jade leaves of Earth Immortals, making them quite precious. After I give you this, we can split the rest seventy-thirty. That’s fair enough, right?"

Chen Ping'an scoffed, "Accepting such a hot item would be akin to smearing mud on my own trousers. Shouldn’t it be a sixty-forty split instead?"

Furthermore, the most coveted treasures among mountain spirits and monsters were undoubtedly the demon cores. 

It was likely that the scholar had already swallowed those whole and taken the biggest advantage.

Feigning realization, the scholar slapped his forehead and apologized, "I miscalculated. Alright then, it’s sixty-forty. Let’s leave the bones here. Come on, I’ll take you to pillage the treasures of Crumbling Mountain. The entrance is just beneath the Summer Retreat Lady's mandarin duck couch. This mother toad may not be very powerful, but thanks to her lover's gifts and the concessions from the other five monsters, she still managed to acquire quite a few treasures."

The scholar led the way into the main hall.

Chen Ping'an sheathed his sword on his back, leaped down from the wall, and followed the scholar. With a flick of his sleeve, he collected the bones into his spatial item.

The scholar stopped, turned around, and looked at him in surprise.

Chen Ping'an smiled and explained, "If the creatures of Crumbling Mountain were to catch sight of it, wouldn’t that be a problem? We wouldn’t want to alert the snakes in the grass and jeopardize our upcoming demon-slaying mission. It’s better to keep it hidden for now."

The scholar chuckled in annoyance, "Should I thank you for that?"

Chen Ping'an ignored him, surveying the surroundings. The spacious boudoir was filled with odd treasures, though it had a heavy scent of makeup. The wall paintings included some rather indecent spring palace scenes, each remarkably large, at least ten feet high. Fortunately, the figures were no more than the size of jujube pits. The artwork depicted scenes of imperial debauchery and spring nights in brothels, with one piece showing a couple in Daoist robes— the man exuding an air of immortality and the woman radiating divine light— seemingly practicing techniques of cultivation, with meticulous annotations in tiny script, perhaps the so-called "Divine Immortal Texts" as mentioned by Zhu Lian.

The scholar kicked the huge mandarin duck couch, and with a clever maneuver, it slid several feet without a sound.

He crouched down, eyes fixed on a circular piece of gleaming iron embedded in the floor, roughly the size of a washbasin, seeming to decipher a mechanism.

Turning his head, the scholar felt a surge of anger. What a piece of work! He had learned just how meticulous the thief in the blue shirt was. Not only had he taken the six concealed paintings with cultivation secrets, but he had also stuffed all the jars and bottles from the Summer Retreat Lady’s vanity into his bag. Did he think he had never seen money in his life? But the scholar quickly turned back, continuing to examine the strange iron that gleamed like a mirror, a hint of gloom clouding his brow. He knew they would soon enter the Glorious Cold Palace's treasury, facing real treasures, yet this fellow was so brazenly collecting these worthless items. Wasn’t he being a bit too greedy for mere trinkets? 

Chen Ping'an rummaged through the cabinets and asked, "What did you mean earlier when you said the Summer Retreat Lady was a moon palace descendant?"

The scholar gently traced the edge of the “mirror,” his fingers forming seals in his sleeve, performing calculations in his mind, and casually replied, "Heaven and Earth have the sun and moon, and the moon is the source of Yin. It is said that there once existed a Moon Palace in the heavenly court, known as the Glorious Cold Palace. Inside the Moon Palace are the cassia tree, moon hare, and toad, all ancestors of the moon palace kind. They have absorbed celestial essence and each became a spirit or deity. This Summer Retreat Lady is a descendant of the Moon Palace toads, but just like the countless types of dragon-like creatures, there are vast differences in their abilities. This one from Crumbling Mountain is just an average specimen among the moon palace monsters."

Chen Ping'an praised, "You’re quite knowledgeable."

While the scholar focused on deciphering the treasury's mechanisms, Chen Ping'an kept a distance of ten steps, indicating his stance. 

He chose a huanghuali wood chair to sit down.

The scholar shook his head and sighed, "My life has limits, but knowledge is boundless."

Chen Ping'an casually remarked, "To pursue the boundless with a limited life is dangerous."

The scholar turned to glance at Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an crossed his legs and twisted his wrist, producing the jade bamboo fan gifted by Cui Dongshan, gently waving it to create a refreshing breeze.

The scholar turned back, extending a finger to lightly tap the mirror-like surface. Slowly, an image began to rise from it, transforming into a palace-like structure, appearing as if a tower was rising within the moon.

Chen Ping'an quickly stowed the fan into his spatial item, disregarding any potential taboos, and approached the scholar, staring intently at the previously perfect piece of iron. At a distance, it seemed like a smooth mirror forged through countless hammerings; who would have thought such a profound mystery lay within? What astonished him even more was that even when he focused intently on it, he still felt that the previous "alignment" was overly exaggerated. The scholar, however, furrowed his brow, repeatedly pushing the palace door back into place, restoring it to its flat mirror state. Chen Ping'an watched in rapt attention, exclaiming in wonder— such exquisite forging techniques truly existed in this world?

Chen Ping'an, now unconcerned about whether he would be acting suspiciously, said, "Rest assured, I won’t ambush you."

The scholar sat cross-legged and slowly said, "This is undoubtedly a treasure crafted by the Mo family’s mechanism masters, and it’s quite ancient. If it belongs to you, once we enter the treasury, shall we split it seventy-thirty?"

Without hesitation, Chen Ping'an nodded, "Sure."

The scholar suddenly smiled, his fingers tapping the mirror surface rapidly, and in an instant, a pocket-sized palace rose once more, the main door of the residence slowly opening, causing the entire structure to shimmer with light, illuminating the faces of both men. The floor began to creak, and the scholar reached into his sleeve, producing a bright, spherical object that spun in his palm like a radiant moon. Then, twisting his wrist and rubbing his hands together, the palace on the surface of the moon-like sphere seemed to retract into the ground, revealing a hidden passageway below, which was not dark at all, illuminated by a soft, flickering yellow light, likely from enchanted lanterns illuminating the way.

The scholar handed the sphere to Chen Ping'an, "From now on, seventy-thirty, as agreed."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Naturally."

Both paused slightly.

One handed over the item while the other received it, both using a single hand.

The scholar smiled faintly, the other sleeve of his robe moving slightly, the anomaly subsiding. 

Chen Ping'an, with his hand still tucked in his sleeve holding a string of walnuts, gently loosened his grip.

Only then did they exchange the treasures.

Chen Ping'an stowed the sphere into his spatial item and followed the scholar into the secret passage.

The tunnel, extending downward, was slightly damp and filled with a dense, chilly aura, with walls covered in dark moss, fitting for a moon palace creature's secret lair.

Eventually, they reached a stone chamber at the end.

There, two skeletons sat side by side, one tall and robust, the other slender, resembling a pair of male and female Daoist partners, their hands tightly clasped, giving off an air of peaceful passing. 

One wore a royal crown and a dragon robe in royal yellow, while the other was draped in a Daoist robe that was almost a Daoist garment.

In addition, three boxes were piled in the corner.

The scholar frowned at the two skeletons, lost in thought.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Are these the remains of a monarch from the battle at the Bone Beach?"

The scholar nodded, "Very likely the king of Longshan Kingdom, who was a downtrodden illegitimate son in his youth. Back then, the largest sect in southern North Julu Continent was called Qingdezong, and all the practitioners on the mountain were praised as hidden immortals. The conflict between the two great dynasties stemmed from an internal strife within Qingdezong, but later generations of immortals kept it secret. This monarch, in his youth, aspired to cultivate the Dao, wearing a white dragon robe, and sought out immortals on the mountain. In the same year, thirty were taken in as core disciples by Qingdezong. Initially, their potential wasn’t apparent, just a regular recruitment at the ancestral hall of Cuiwei Peak. Yet within just a few decades, other mountains in North Julu began to notice something unusual—half of those thirty were exceptional prospects for Earth Immortal material, while the rest also had their own fortunes. Hence, the sight of those thirty disciples ascending the mountain to pay their respects sparked endless imaginations in later generations, evidenced by poetry proclaiming, 'With a sound of the drum opening the golden door, thirty immortals ascend Cuiwei.' This king of Longshan was among them, one of the best among that group, but unfortunately, members of the royal family qualified to inherit the throne kept dying young. He had to descend the mountain, already at the Dragon Gate stage, choosing to sever his bridge to immortality to inherit the throne. There are rumors circulating that he had a close relationship with a master aunt from Qingdezong’s Fengming Peak, which I didn’t believe before, but now it seems true."

The scholar sighed deeply, no longer looking at the two skeletons. The dragon robe was merely an ordinary item, looking precious but devoid of the dragon energy that had long been drained or dissipated. After all, when a dynasty ends, its dragon energy scatters. The Daoist robe worn by the female practitioner was not a treasure either, just a common robe bestowed by the ancestral hall to all inner disciples of Qingdezong. This earthly monarch and the Fengming Peak female cultivator were likely both nostalgic souls.

The scholar began opening the three boxes one by one. The first contained a shimmering pile of snowflake currency, numbering in the thousands. The second held an ancient statue tablet inscribed with dense seal script. The last box, resting at the bottom, contained only a small stone pestle, resembling a common tool used by city folk to pound glutinous rice.

The scholar’s expression shifted slightly, shaking his head gently, clearly feeling that his earlier guess was unlikely.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Could it be the legendary pestle used by the moon palace hare to grind medicine?"

The scholar chuckled, "Shall we make a bet on it?"

Chen Ping'an asked, "What kind of bet?"

The scholar pointed at the pestle inside the box, "This counts as seven, while the rest count as three, but I’ll let you choose first."

Without hesitation, Chen Ping'an was about to choose three.

The scholar quickly interjected, "Hold on, I changed my mind."

With a slap of his hand, the pestle instantly turned to powder, revealing a white bowl-like piece of jade inside. He lamented, "Just as I suspected, this white jade bowl is where the Summer Retreat Lady attained her Dao. As a moon palace creature, she likely crafted the stone pestle to encase it, probably hoping for a good omen."

The scholar picked up the bowl, holding it in his palm, and noticed eight tiny characters inscribed at the bottom: "Qingde Hidden Immortal, Inviting the Moon with Wine." It was one of the ceremonial vessels from Qingdezong's ancestral hall.

Just a spirit tool.

But for the Summer Retreat Lady, who had cultivated to become a spirit, it held immense significance.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Are you choosing the Dragon Gate monument or the box of snowflake currency?"

The scholar's eyelids twitched.

There were ancient seal scripts that were difficult to recognize unless one belonged to a well-established immortal clan. 

How did this young outsider recognize the ancient seal characters for "Dragon Gate"?

The scholar smiled.

This underground stone chamber was indeed a suitable place for life-and-death struggles.

But just at that moment, he unexpectedly said, "Not only will this Dragon Gate statue be yours, but you’ll take the box of snowflake currency seventy-thirty, and I want those two skeletons."

The scholar was puzzled, "Those two skeletons are hardly worth anything. This Qingdezong female practitioner was only at the Dragon Gate stage in life, and her robe is ordinary, worth not even a few small summer coins. That dragon robe, if you believe, just a gentle touch will turn it to ashes."

The scholar's smile turned playful, "Besides, stripping corpses is inappropriate, especially for a female practitioner, don’t you think?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "That’s none of your concern."

The scholar nodded, "Then it's settled."

With a flourish of his sleeve, he collected the stone tablet along with the wooden box, while Chen Ping'an simultaneously stowed the two skeletons into his spatial item.

It was evident that the scholar also possessed at least one spatial item.

As for the box of snowflake currency, Chen Ping'an received about fifteen hundred coins.

The scholar, having gained the larger share, still felt somewhat unsatisfied. "The Summer Retreat Lady of Crumbling Mountain needs to regularly pay homage to her great benefactor; her resources are still rather thin. Otherwise, a Golden Core monster should have more than this.”

Chen Ping'an remarked, "In the Ghostly Abyss, fighting for survival is already quite difficult; how can we compare with the Golden Core Earth Immortals outside?"

The scholar nodded, "Exactly."

Chen Ping'an casually asked, "Do you have a water bottle or something similar for storing spirit water?"

In an instant, Chen Ping'an drew his sword, and the two flying swords, Initial One and Fifteen, pierced through the ground, one pointing directly at the scholar's head and the other hovering behind him, its tip aimed at his heart.

The scholar sighed, "What are you doing? Are you planning to stab me in the back? You really want to wait until we’ve dealt with the other five mountain lairs, each filled to the brim before we go at it?"

Chen Ping'an's expression was serious; in that moment, he had sensed the scholar’s killing intent.

The scholar harbored a heavier murderous intent than what had been present at the location of the Summer Retreat Lady’s death.

Chen Ping'an could see that at this moment, the scholar's demeanor was unchanged, from his mindset to his expression.

Chen Ping'an let Initial One and Fifteen return to the sword nurturing gourd and sheathed the sword, saying, "My eyes were playing tricks on me. I mistook you for an intruder wanting to ambush you."

The scholar chuckled, "Who would have thought this brother of mine has such a compassionate heart? Just don’t get woozy with blood and confuse your senses when we’re battling at the other mountains."

Chen Ping'an smiled in response.

The two left the stone chamber, traversing the dimly lit passageway, returning the way they came.

Walking side by side, the scholar asked with a smile, "What do you go by?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "My surname is Chen, and my name is Good Person."

The scholar seemed taken aback, momentarily at a loss for words.

He had seen shamelessness before, but never this level of audacity.

Chen Ping'an asked, "And you?"

The scholar, still recovering, replied weakly, "I won’t say my surname, but you can call me Mu Mao—Mu for tree, and Mao for flourishing."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Nice name."

The scholar replied, "Not as good as you, Good Person."

Chen Ping'an said, "Wherever, wherever."

The scholar suddenly asked with a smile, "Do you know the roots of that Pi Chen Yuan Jun?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "You know I’m an outsider. I came to the Ghostly Abyss just to sightsee, and I happened to pass through Crumbling Mountain. How would I know the origins of these monsters? But these creatures are interesting; they dare to call themselves the Six Saints, either a lady or a lord, even their minions dare to call themselves gentlemen."

The scholar said, "Monsters from small places often care about their reputation. That Pi Chen Yuan Jun was originally a clever little ferret from the small Xuandu Temple. After gnawing on two ceremonial incense sticks, he still wasn’t satisfied and even stole the oil from a glazed lamp. After stealing it, he accidentally knocked over the lamp, thus awakening and achieving his Dao. A little celestial boy caught him in the act, and in a fit of anger, he beat him to a pulp with his dust whisk, leaving him on the verge of death. Unexpectedly, the old immortal took pity on this fate and not only released him from the temple and peach forest but also took some ancient soil from under the peach tree and smeared it on his wounds, which is why this little ferret is naturally impervious to water and fire, and ordinary weapons can’t harm it at all."

The scholar recounted these secrets as if he had witnessed them firsthand, "Once this little ferret left the peach forest, it roamed free, claiming mountains as its own and self-titled as Yuan Jun while living quite leisurely. However, it still reminisced about the incense of the Xuandu Temple where it achieved the Dao, especially venerating the old immortal, so it set up an altar on its own mountain, offering incense and worshipping daily. Most spirits in this world are like this, venerating the places of their Dao achievement and the chances of becoming a spirit. The Summer Retreat Lady is the same, and this little ferret is too. Speaking of which, this Pi Chen Yuan Jun is just as naïve as the Summer Retreat Lady— a monster with powerful backing. Are you not afraid of provoking that temple’s master? After all, one must consider the master when dealing with a dog."

Chen Ping'an replied, "Then let’s not provoke Pi Chen Yuan Jun; let’s go find the Mountain-Moving Great Sage instead."

The scholar laughed heartily, "No need for such caution; that old immortal only respects the fate of the Dao. As for the little ferret itself, he doesn’t care much. If we work together, we can take it down easily."

Chen Ping'an asked, "How do you understand the thoughts of an old Daoist immortal so well? I’ve heard that cultivators, before seizing their opportunity, hope for the best, but once they achieve the Dao, they fear the unexpected."

The scholar began to act mischievous, "Believe it or not, anyway, I must go to the Earth-Flowing Mountain. The Mountain-Moving Great Sage has been quite lively lately, the monster-catching great immortal from the Dirty Water Cave, and the Thunder God from the Jixiao Mountain are likely partying together, plotting something. Perhaps the daughter of that old tortoise from the Ghostly River will also be there flattering the Mountain-Moving Great Sage. Only the Pi Chen Yuan Jun doesn’t like the hustle and bustle; it’s probably alone right now. If you think the Xuandu Temple’s name is too frightening, then we can part ways amicably? You take your sunny path, and I’ll take my narrow bridge, what do you say?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "That sounds good. We shall part ways."

The scholar was taken aback again but said nothing further.

He merely regarded Chen Ping'an as an oddball with a peculiar temperament.

Upon returning to the Summer Retreat Lady's boudoir, the scholar extended his hand, signaling Chen Ping'an to go ahead, leaving Crumbling Mountain first to avoid any misunderstandings about him running out of the Glorious Cold Palace, causing a stir among the monster inhabitants.

Chen Ping'an leaped onto the wall and quietly departed.

The scholar remained in place, acting so kindly not only to avoid breaking the facade but also because he was pleased to have this man confront the Mountain-Moving Great Sage head-on, drawing attention away so he could leisurely deal with Pi Chen Yuan Jun and have another feast. These monsters, though not highly skilled, formed their own structure and supported each other, which was their foundation for survival in the Ghostly Abyss. Otherwise, a mere Nascent Soul would sweep through and easily obliterate them all, making their current situation unmanageable. Historically, a Nascent Soul shade from a northern city attempted to crush the monsters with sheer strength and suffered a great loss right here, nearly perishing at Jixiao Mountain.

The scholar raised his palm and lightly blew, a crimson demon core hovering in his palm, spinning and emitting waves of misty cold.

He wasn’t a monster or spirit; consuming such an item would ruin his own path.

He produced a crystal-clear white jade box, sealing the demon core inside, brushed off his sleeves—having absorbed the essence of the Summer Retreat Lady's flesh and blood, his robe, which he had taken from an evil Earth Immortal long ago, named "Hundred-Eyed Glutton," had initially been of low grade, not even qualifying as a treasure. Wearing it not only concealed his identity but, more importantly, it could grow. Over the years, each rare outing to slay demons and monsters had largely become nourishment for this robe.

The scholar suddenly extended a finger, rubbing his brow, muttering to himself, "Earlier in the stone chamber, why did you stop me from killing? Just to ruin some of your merits? When you sever your three corpses next year, everything will be resolved. You’re quite interesting; other Daoists who achieve the Golden Immortal often sever their three corpses and nine insects, but you’ve chosen to leave me for last."

The scholar remained silent for a moment, his expression complex.

With a flick of his sleeve, he transformed into a billowing black smoke, vanishing into the ground in an instant.

In a courtyard of the Glorious Cold Palace, a fan-wielding spirit creature, self-styled as a gentleman scholar, drank and celebrated with a group of Crumbling Mountain rascals.

This "gentleman" felt somewhat dejected, drowning his sorrows in wine. The others, lacking insight, drank to excess, flailing about, spitting words without restraint, with one saying that the Summer Retreat Lady had a round, plump bottom and that if given the chance, he’d gladly touch it, while another boasted about the voluptuous daughter of the Black River King, claiming he’d definitely take a chance with her. There were even more reckless ones, bragging that the Mountain-Moving Great Sage was nothing; if the Summer Retreat Lady commanded, he could smash that Mountain-Moving Gorilla's head with a punch...

The fan-wielding spirit drained his cup and felt that being with these fools was a real buzzkill, unworthy of the fine copper-scented city wine in his glass.

He sighed, waving his fan and shaking his empty cup, "Wine brings joy, dispelling worries. If the heavens will it this way, let’s drink this cup of liquid..."

The other spirits laughed heartily, not taking offense. This gentleman was beginning to get sour again.

The fan-wielding spirit glanced toward the Summer Retreat Lady's courtyard, feeling a heat in his abdomen. Regardless, the lady’s figure was indeed exceptional.

Thinking about how over the years, while serving in Crumbling Mountain, he had received very few benefits, he wished to become the Summer Retreat Lady’s cherished guest. In the eyes of living people, she might not be seen as a beauty, but to creatures like them, why should they care about such things? Yet he feared the lady's celestial techniques in the bedroom; if he misstepped, he could die under the peony blossoms.

The Summer Retreat Lady seemed to leave the mountain alone every few years, meeting someone or doing something, and no one knew why.

There were many rumors. Some claimed the Summer Retreat Lady was the mistress of the city lord of the Pink Maiden City, while others said the true master of Crumbling Mountain was the ghost king who shared a name with the White Cage City’s Pu Rang. Some even suggested the Summer Retreat Lady was the only daughter of the Black River King.

The fan-wielding spirit drank and felt a twinge of jealousy.

Why wouldn’t the Summer Retreat Lady open her heart to him?

He was somewhat inebriated.

Wondering if he would ever be like the Summer Retreat Lady, possessing a mountain, building a grand residence, conjuring wind and rain, and living in splendor.

Thinking about whether one day he could leave the Ghostly Abyss and explore the vast world beyond Bone Beach, visiting a Confucian academy and meeting true scholars, reading the real Confucian classics.

Earth-Flowing Mountain.

It was far more heavily guarded than Crumbling Mountain.

It even had a well-structured protective mountain formation.

But to the scholar, it felt like entering a no-man's land.

However, quietly slaying demons and robbing treasures without causing a stir would be difficult.

The scholar, unhurried, entered Earth-Flowing Mountain, standing atop a lush pine tree, waiting patiently.

As long as the mountain waters’ formation activated, it would signal that the Mountain-Moving Great Sage had begun to breach the mountain or that his whereabouts had been revealed, marking the time for him to act.

The only thing to be cautious of was the old tortoise in the Old Dragon Cave and the little tortoise in the Black River, who had a close relationship with the Summer Retreat Lady. It wasn’t that he feared them teaming up with Earth-Flowing Mountain, but rather that they were difficult to kill. If they insisted on protecting Pi Chen Yuan Jun, it would become quite tricky. The scholar's endeavor to slay monsters was, after all, merely a leisurely pursuit, similar to humorously taking an entrance exam in the copper-scented city, just for amusement.

This Pi Chen Yuan Jun and the old tortoise from the Black River had roots in the small Xuandu Temple and were somewhat connected to the Great Round Moon Temple. The old tortoise was raised in the release pond of the temple and had been listening to teachings for many years before Bone Beach became ancient battlefield ruins. According to governmental historical records, before the old tortoise achieved its spirit form, it had often floated at the temple, listening to the teachings. Later, during the conflict between the two great dynasties, which involved many vassal states, the temple was protected by an old monk who had already attained the Golden Body, allowing it to avoid war devastation. Eventually, it moved into the Ghostly Abyss peach forest and became neighbors with the small Xuandu Temple, which was originally thousands of miles away.

The old tortoise secretly left the temple, calling itself the Black River King, and occupied an unfathomable cave, naming it Old Dragon Cave. It raised a pair of golden fish, claiming they were its daughter's dowry.

His daughter self-titled the Sea-Covering Lord. The old tortoise rarely showed its face, leaving matters of the mountain to her. The Old Dragon Cave was situated next to a surging river, which she occupied, leading the water spirits to cause disturbances year-round. This little tortoise was dark and robust. Once, when the city lord of Pink Maiden City encountered it, he threw a sharp remark, saying the little tortoise looked so evil that he couldn’t bring himself to eat even if the lights were out. This became the little tortoise’s greatest embarrassment.

The scholar stood on the tree, taking a deep breath, absorbing the yin energy contained in the ancient pine until it was completely drained, then exhaling it gently. The surroundings turned into a misty haze. He spread his palm, drawing symbols with his fingers.

He surveyed the mountains and rivers.

With a flick of his palm, he conjured a landscape painting of Earth-Flowing Mountain’s residence.

The painting appeared slightly blurred; he was unwilling to leave any traces, after all, that Pi Chen Yuan Jun was of the Daoist lineage and a Golden Core cultivator— perhaps he would sense something.

Atop a high platform in the Earth-Flowing Mountain residence, a banquet was being held.

The scholar couldn’t help but chuckle.

He observed that the banquet was filled with monsters, each appearing robust, looking like fierce protectors of their master.

The scholar murmured, "What’s going on? Why is everyone gathering at Earth-Flowing Mountain? Is that guy luckier than me? Did he stumble upon this or anticipate it all along?"

Cultivators and deities all have their respective manifestations, while the shapeshifting monsters possess their true forms. The higher their cultivation, the more indistinct their true forms become. Once they reach the Nascent Soul stage, they can completely conceal their true forms. 

However, beneath the Nascent Soul level, especially among Golden Core monsters, their true forms are the most condensed and solid, making them hardest to hide.

Highly skilled Nascent Soul cultivators and some long-established Golden Core sect members can often see through the true forms of monsters.

The scholar quickly retracted his mountain-and-river observing technique.

With a swift glance, he caught sight of a silver-backed monkey as the Mountain-Moving Great Sage, a plump rat spirit as the demon-catching celestial, and a colorful python coiled around the Thunder God.

Of course, there was also Pi Chen Yuan Jun in its true form as a cute golden-furred ferret.

Additionally, there was a Golden Core ghost.

Aside from the old tortoise and its daughter from the Black River, everyone had arrived— except for one particular Golden Core ghost who enjoyed competing with the city folk.

The scholar helplessly remarked, "Don’t let me get caught in the crossfire; my luck can’t be that bad, can it?"

The Ghostly Abyss, existing for a millennium, had some invisible suppression for Qi practitioners. The higher their realm, the heavier the confinement.

Moreover, for certain practitioners with special identities, the pressure could be quite significant.

Such as for him.

Common folk might suffer from acclimatization issues, and cultivators would face even more significant challenges.

Especially him, with a pure Yang constitution, he was practically in direct conflict with the Ghostly Abyss’ nature. If not for his exceptionally refined cultivation method, which was far beyond mere trickery, allowing his fate to harmonize with the yin and yang, he would have faced considerable trouble here— like being in a pitch-black night where only a lantern hung high, he would become the target of countless malevolent spirits.

The scholar began to murmur to himself, "Leave?"

After a brief silence, he smiled, "Then let’s wait and see. I can’t die at the hands of others; otherwise, your breakthrough will have significant flaws."

Since the scholar had made up his mind, he felt as calm as water. 

He began to observe the changes, closing his eyes to concentrate, regulating his breath.

He attempted to refine the Dragon Gate stone tablet, hoping to see if it would yield results, adding a finishing touch.

An aura of mist descended like gentle rain, and within the water realm, an old dragon roamed the clouds, guiding the water.

In the fire realm, a robust man engulfed in flames, resembling a fire deity, hammered a short blade, sending sparks flying with each swing.

Another crucial area resembled a battlefield of mountains and valleys, lush greenery, and at the summit stood a Daoist temple with green glazed tiles, a golden plaque hanging above it.

Another area appeared as a battlefield, with two armies clashing, golden weapons clinking.

When the scholar attempted to refine the stone statue tablet obtained from Crumbling Mountain, a stone tablet rose in the water realm, slowly ascending, the words "Dragon Gate" glowing with golden light.

The scholar didn’t push to refine the entire statue tablet in one go; once the "Dragon Gate" characters manifested, he stopped, opening his eyes and exhaling a breath of turbid air.

He shook his sleeves, gazing at the residence where the monsters, riding the wind, began to soar toward him. Meanwhile, the protective mountain formation covering Earth-Flowing Mountain activated instantly, but he didn’t mind it too much.

The scholar turned to glance at the direction of the Mountain-Moving Great Sage, smiling, "Good Person, you’ve taken the lion’s share from Crumbling Mountain. Now consider this a little favor I’m returning to you. If you can’t even gain something from this, it will truly disappoint me."

The scholar then glanced over at Treasure Mirror Mountain, wondering how the situation there was progressing. 

The Five Elements’ earth, the Three Mountains and Nine Halls Mirror. 

It was the last item related to the fundamental principles of his path.

Such a significant matter, of course, he had to come and see for himself.

Once the Five Elements were complete, and he severed all three corpses, not only would he easily ascend to the Nascent Soul stage, but thereafter breaking through the Nascent Soul bottleneck to become a top-tier practitioner would be a smooth journey. The heart devil wouldn’t be as challenging to overcome as the usual Nascent Souls; instead, he could rely on the steady grind of effort, and in two to three hundred years, it could gradually be eradicated with almost no risk, benefiting his soul during the process.

This was the depth of the most prestigious immortal clans in one continent.
