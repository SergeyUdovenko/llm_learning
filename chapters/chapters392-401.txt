### Chapter 392: A Gentleman's Choice to Rescue or Not

Not long after the Daoist nun from the Sword Sect departed, Pei Qian tiptoed out of the house, her forehead adorned with a yellow talisman.

Shi Rou stood by the door, her expression tense. Even though she could no longer sense the nun's presence, she still felt a lingering fear.

As a ghostly entity, she roamed the mortal realm brazenly, yet danger lurked everywhere. While dressing like a monkey might invite ridicule, her kind—usurpers of celestial energies—risked dire consequences if recognized by a powerful cultivator from a reputable lineage.

Pei Qian approached Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian, glancing towards the wall.

Zhu Lian chuckled, "It's just a single fox hair drained of spirit. Are you really going to treat it like a treasure?"

He reached down, picked up the black fox hair that had supported the fox spirit's illusion, pinching it between his fingers before offering it to Pei Qian. "If you want it, take it."

Pei Qian hid behind Chen Ping'an and cautiously asked, "Can it be sold for money?"

Zhu Lian twisted the resilient fox hair between his fingers, surprisingly unable to reduce it to ashes. He stared at it, intrigued. "It's certainly a good item, but it's unlikely to have any real use. If one could skin a whole fox, it might just be a natural robe."

Chen Ping'an interjected, "Best not to say such things."

Zhu Lian grinned. "Indeed, it seems I’ve misspoken."

The commotion here evidently attracted the attention of the other two groups of demon catchers. A young man with the surname Dugu and his companions, along with a pair of cultivator partners, hurried over, their expressions varying. The sight of Chen Ping'an evoked a complex reaction. The fox spirit, originally scheduled to appear later, had shown up early—why was that? And the fierce blade aura that shattered the fox spirit's illusion left both parties in shock. They hadn't anticipated the nun's formidable cultivation; one strike had obliterated the spirit's disguise. The previous intelligence from the Lion's Garden had suggested the fox was elusive, and no cultivator had managed to grasp even a corner of its clothing, be it through formations or treasures.

Chen Ping'an recounted the clash between the fox spirit and the nun, omitting her identity entirely.

An elder with a fiery red little raccoon perched on his shoulder suddenly spoke up, "Young Master Chen, would you sell me that fox hair? Perhaps I can find some clues and uncover the fox spirit's hiding place."

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "How much are you offering?"

The elder weighed the pros and cons. "The hair has completely lost its spirit, so it's hardly worth even a snowflake coin."

Chen Ping'an hesitated, not immediately responding.

Behind the young master Dugu, a beautiful maid with autumn-like eyes exhibited a hint of sarcasm.

It seemed that this young cultivator, dressed in a white robe and carrying a white-sheathed sword, appeared to be a mountain dweller but was quite the merchant at heart. A piece of fox hair worth merely a snowflake coin needed elaboration? However, she quickly reconciled herself to the idea that such sanctimonious cultivators were often just that—sanctimonious.

Following her master on journeys through the mountains, she had witnessed many things. How many people could truly impress her master? No wonder he returned from his excursions with disappointment.

Suddenly, the maid noticed the little charcoal-skinned girl behind the young man, who was looking at her.

The maid smiled warmly at Pei Qian.

Pei Qian grinned back.

Chen Ping'an then turned to the elder. "I just remembered I have some unrefined techniques that might help in locating the fox spirit, so I won’t be selling it."

The elder laughed heartily. "We all came to subdue demons. Since you have your own use for it, a gentleman doesn’t take away another’s joy. I won’t insist."

After they left, Chen Ping'an hesitated and turned to Pei Qian seriously. "Do you understand why your master wouldn’t sell that fox hair?"

Pei Qian replied decisively, "That man was lying, intentionally lowering the price, harboring ill intentions. Master is sharp-eyed and saw right through it. He felt displeased and didn’t want to complicate matters. If that fox spirit was secretly watching and got provoked, we would become the target of its wrath, disrupting Master’s plans. I originally wanted to watch from the sidelines, just enjoying the scenery and sipping tea, but if I stirred trouble, the little courtyard could turn into a bloodbath... Master, I’ve said so much, surely one of my reasons is correct, right? Haha, I’m quite clever, aren’t I?"

Zhu Lian clicked his tongue. "Someone wants to eat chestnuts now."

Sure enough, Chen Ping'an gave Pei Qian a light knock on the head.

Pei Qian turned to glare at Zhu Lian. "You jinx!"

Zhu Lian laughed. "Afraid of the weak, but not the strong? You think I'm easy to bully, huh? You want me to sprinkle dirt in your favorite dishes?"

Pei Qian felt a bit guilty, glancing at Chen Ping'an, and lowered her head.

From their first meeting in the Lotus Flower Abode to tossing the old, foul-smelling Taoist into the air, Pei Qian felt that Chen Ping'an was the one who understood her best in the world. As the saying goes, she was a notorious troublemaker, which made her a bit fearful now.

Chen Ping'an ruffled her hair gently. "I read somewhere that Buddhist scriptures say, ‘What happened yesterday is dead; what happens today is alive.’ Do you know what that means?"

Pei Qian looked up and lightly shook her head.

Chen Ping'an smiled. "You’ll understand in the future."

Pei Qian’s eyes lit up. "Master, can you carve that saying onto a small bamboo slip for me? And if you can, add the two lines from the River God Temple?"

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement. He then took the opportunity to discuss the matter of selling or not selling the fox hair with Pei Qian, sharing some principles he rarely explained to her. "When wandering the world, one must be cautious. One should not harbor ill intentions towards others. However, if you lack even the awareness to guard against others, wouldn’t that just benefit the wrongdoers? Always displaying sincerity on the surface and revealing your innermost thoughts to everyone will only make the world more treacherous. True sincerity is indeed a beautiful thing, but knowing how to protect it, without harming others or oneself, requires accumulating experience in the world."

Zhu Lian smiled. "A kind heart shouldn’t be naive. A wise man is not without guile; these golden words are the true teachings from books."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Zhu Lian speaks better than I do, and without the rambling."

Chen Ping'an retrieved the last of the osmanthus wine from the three jars they had brought, handing one to Zhu Lian. The Fan family had sent a large amount of osmanthus wine, but it came in two varieties. One was enough for Chen Ping'an to drink on the road; he had consumed a great deal already. Just today, he had shared a jar with Xu Yuanxia, and tomorrow it would be Zhang Shanfeng’s turn. By the time they reached the capital of Qingluan, he would be out. The other variety was extremely rare, said to be personally brewed by Lady Osmanthus on Osmanthus Island, with only six jars made. Even Fan Junmao had longed for it, shamelessly taking one.

Pei Qian turned to Zhu Lian, curiously asking, "Which book says that?"

Zhu Lian laughed heartily. "The book of life’s hardships teaches the most about being human."

Pei Qian, unable to bear it when her master was pressured by others, scoffed at Zhu Lian. "But I can still learn boundlessly from the sea, my knowledge is bottomless. Anyone can spout random nonsense, but my master says it well—much better!"

Zhu Lian shook his head, drinking his wine, losing interest in sparring with her.

Chen Ping'an said to Pei Qian, "Don’t dismiss everything Zhu Lian says just because you’re not close to him. Forget it; we can talk about this later."

Chen Ping'an felt there was no rush, and he didn’t need to overwhelm Pei Qian with all the truths he believed in at once.

For someone like Pei Qian, with such a good memory, reciting tens of thousands of words from the classics couldn’t compare to her genuinely understanding just one or two sentences of his teachings.

Zhu Lian had casually mentioned something at the River God Temple that had made Chen Ping'an reflect deeply. The classic texts were meant for sages, and Chen Ping'an began to introspect, realizing that while he might not have read as much as true scholars, he had read enough compared to the average person. So, after careful consideration, he pondered how many teachings he had given to the classic texts over the years.

With a sigh, Chen Ping'an decided to practice some martial forms in the house.

It was too obvious here in the courtyard.

Inside the house, the female ghost Shi Rou, upon hearing Chen Ping'an's words about the Buddhist scriptures, fell into a daze for a moment. She eventually sighed softly, collected herself, held her breath, and began to practice the breathing techniques taught by Cui Dongshan, gradually refining the remnants of the celestial being.

After Chen Ping'an closed the door, Pei Qian whispered, "Old chef, does my master seem unhappy? Does he think I’m foolish?"

Zhu Lian smiled and asked, "How about some wine? Let’s drink away the ages of sorrow."

Pei Qian crossed her arms defiantly, huffing, "I’ve already suffered a loss with Cui Dongshan once. You can’t ruin my resolve!"

Zhu Lian nearly spat out his drink. "You little brat, what resolve do you have?"

Pei Qian stood up, hands behind her back, sighing dramatically, but not before casting a pitying glance at Zhu Lian, as if to say she wouldn’t bother playing music for a cow.

After she turned away, Zhu Lian kicked Pei Qian’s rear, nearly sending the little charcoal girl tumbling. Years of traveling and practicing martial forms had made Pei Qian agile; she managed to brace herself with her hands on the ground and flipped over to face Zhu Lian, her face flushed with anger. "Zhu Lian, why are you ambushing me? What happened to the code of the martial world?! I’m wearing new clothes that I haven’t had for long!"

Zhu Lian asked, "Would you like to learn my self-created martial art called ‘Surge of Insects’? With just a bit of skill, you can unleash punches like thunder in spring. Not only can you confront the people of the martial world, making them feel weak and soft, but it’s also effective against demons and spirits."

Pei Qian retorted, "Who are you?"

Zhu Lian didn’t mind what she thought of him; he simply waved his hand, "Go on, practice your mad sword technique."

Pei Qian felt frustrated, unable to voice everything she wanted to say. Instead, she went back to her room, grabbed her walking staff, and began practicing her own "self-created" martial art. After subduing that roadside dog during their travels, her confidence soared. For some time now, aside from dutifully following Chen Ping'an’s six-step stance practice, she had put aside the White Ape Swordsmanship and the Dragging Blade Technique, focusing primarily on this powerful and immediate sword technique.

Pei Qian was thoroughly enjoying herself.

Zhu Lian, as a martial artist of the distant travel realm, found it quite a sight to behold.

Zhu Lian looked around.

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

It appeared that after receiving that blow from the nun’s sword, the fox spirit had become somewhat more cautious.

Inside the two rooms of the small courtyard, Shi Rou was practicing the superior secret technique taught by Cui Dongshan, using her ghostly spirit and the remnants of the celestial being.

Meanwhile, Chen Ping'an was performing the Heavenly Stance, standing on his hands with just one finger extended.

At the same time, his mind was immersed in the "Water Mansion," which had refined the Water Character Seal.

According to Cui Dongshan’s explanation, the jade slip from the Water Mansion, which had appeared during the extraordinary event in the clouds above the Old Dragon City, was likely a precious relic from a certain ancient Dragon Palace. The water energy condensed into this jade slip was rumored to be a manifestation of the River God’s generosity, and Cui Dongshan had jokingly remarked that the River God had quite the flair for generosity. As for the characters engraved on the slip, they resonated with Chen Ping'an’s thoughts. The moment he focused on them, they sprang to life as little figures in green robes, carrying the jade slip into his Qi Mansion, helping him paint guardian deities on the "Mansion Gate" and a great river on the walls, creating a rare opportunity for enlightenment.

Even the proud Cui Dongshan had to admit that unless both he and his student worked in unison, it would be incredibly difficult for Chen Ping'an to refine the second life-bound object to match the quality of the first one.

For Chen Ping'an, he understood that fortune was a blessing, and misfortune was a fate to accept.

However, amid this nebulous cycle of gains and losses, he preferred a certain plaque from the crab shop back home, which bore the four characters: "Seek not outside."

When seeking divine intervention, one must first sincerely seek within before discussing the fate beyond.

As the little elixir of sword cultivation in the wine gourd was finished, coupled with his recent recovery, Chen Ping'an had regained most of his strength, nearly back to the level he had before battling Ding Ying in the Lotus Flower Abode.

After inscribing on the wall of the River God Temple, Chen Ping'an vaguely sensed that the "Water Mansion" within him seemed to resonate. The flow of the great river surged slightly, mist rising to envelop the surface. Occasionally, it even overflowed into the "Water Path," permeating the Qi Mansion. However, the entrance of the Water Mansion blocked its return to the wall, restoring calm.

So today, Chen Ping'an decided to try observing it properly using the rudimentary "inner vision" technique learned on the mountain.

To his surprise, as the host, he almost couldn’t even enter the mansion. The pure Qi, birthed from the martial artist, surged forth, almost embodying a "humiliation and death" sentiment, as if seeking to defend Chen Ping'an’s honor. Naturally, Chen Ping'an couldn’t allow this "fire dragon" to break through; otherwise, it would be akin to family members attacking their own gate, highlighting the key reason why great masters could do so but seldom wished to cultivate both paths.

To appease this fire dragon, Chen Ping'an nearly stumbled, having to switch from hand to fist to stabilize himself.

After diverting the fire dragon to another channel, he finally caught his breath. Meanwhile, the two guardian deities on the mansion gate hurriedly opened the gates for Chen Ping'an, bowing profusely in apology. As "Chen Ping'an" stepped into the mansion, he was met with a wondrous sight, one that far surpassed his initial encounter with the Lion's Garden surrounded by mountains.

The successfully refined jade slip from the Water Character Seal hung within this alchemical chamber of the Water Mansion, while the Water Character Seal itself hovered at a higher point.

Those little green-robed figures diligently repaired various parts of the dwelling. Some of the slightly larger ones, like artistic talents, squatted by the great river on the wall, painting the forms of waves.

Even more, some less pure water mist flowed into the mansion after entering through the door, gradually dissipating. Each time, only a thread-thin trickle would seep into the "waterflowers" under the green-robed figures’ pens. Once inside, the waterflowers showed signs of vitality and movement. However, most of these adorable little figures dressed in green were idle; they had painted many waves and rivers, but only a few were alive.

So when they saw Chen Ping'an, they looked somewhat aggrieved, as if saying it was difficult to cook without rice, urging him to draw more and refine more of the spiritual energy.

Chen Ping'an knew that a severed bridge to the River of Eternal Life meant his roots were severely damaged, resulting in the source water for this Water Mansion being too scarce. Coupled with a slow refining speed, this made it hard for these green-robed youths to be busy, and Chen Ping'an had to exit the mansion in shame.

As "Chen Ping'an" walked out of the Water Mansion, the largest of the green-robed youths gathered together to whisper.

Chen Ping'an did not interrupt his inner vision technique but began to follow the path of the fire dragon, embarking on a "walk."

While his consciousness was as small as a mustard seed, the pure Qi coalescing into the fire dragon traveled hundreds of miles in an instant. "Chen Ping'an" traversed the meridian pathways, a journey that spanned thousands of miles. Although he knew where the fire dragon was, he couldn’t catch up.

This was also related to the fact that Chen Ping'an had just been pricked by the Sword-Catching Boat. Otherwise, he could still have commanded the fire dragon to swim back with just a hint of spiritual light, perhaps even riding it to patrol the surroundings.

Eventually, "Chen Ping'an" returned outside the Water Mansion, sitting cross-legged to begin refining the spiritual energy.

Diligence can compensate for clumsiness.

Chen Ping'an excelled at this—he was very good at it.

At this point, Chen Ping'an still didn’t realize the degree of recognition it took for a person like A Liang to say, "All methods do not stray from the source; practicing martial arts is also practicing the sword."

Among the countless martial artists in the world, there was only Chen Ping'an.

---

In an exquisitely embroidered chamber, a young girl awaited her fate.

The frail girl resembled a wilted flower, propped up by her personal maid, Zhao Ya, as she sat in front of the dressing mirror. Despite her pitiful condition, her eyes still sparkled with life; as long as she held onto her thoughts and hopes, she would still be vibrant.

This unfortunate soul was none other than Liu Qingqing, the youngest daughter of the venerable Liu Old Minister. According to the family genealogy, she belonged to the "Qing" generation.

Her elder sister, Liu Qingya, had already married, but due to the troubles caused by her younger sister, she and her husband were now stranded at the Lion's Garden.

Her second brother, Liu Qingshan, used to visit her frequently to chat, but it had been a long time since he had come to see her. She was closest to her second sister, which left her feeling a bit sad.

Her third brother, Liu Qingyu, often came to play, but being younger and overly boisterous, his lively nature was exhausting for the weak girl. She feared he would accidentally break or ruin one of her treasured possessions, which was quite troublesome.

Zhao Ya, the daughter of the old steward, who had a few freckles on her nose, witnessed her lady's strong will. Despite her own sorrow, Zhao Ya forced herself to speak comforting words, saying that her lady looked much better today, that the weather had warmed up, and that perhaps tomorrow she could go downstairs for a walk.

Zhao Ya had brought a bucket of hot water upstairs, intending to help the young lady wash her hair today.

Sitting on the stool, Liu Qingqing touched her thin cheeks and said to Zhao Ya, "Ya’er, let them come today. You rest for a while and read me a passage from a book."

Zhao Ya sighed softly, moving quietly to open the small door of a delicate birdcage on the writing desk.

Although the sounds inside were cheerful, they were actually quite soft and wouldn’t disturb her lady.

Though called a birdcage, it was more like a miniature pavilion, a signature product of the capital city where nearly every noble lady of Qingluan had one. Within it, instead of birds, resided various delicate and charming spirits, such as the little maidens resembling dragonflies that loved to comb hair with their tiny claws. They were remarkably meticulous, enhancing the hair's luster and preventing women from aging prematurely.

There were also butterfly spirits renowned for their beauty; with a complete set of micro-sculpted brushes, they could paint exquisite eyebrows for women once shown various styles of makeup.

Additionally, there were tiny spirits that delighted in eating cosmetics, with birdlike bodies and arms that could apply rouge more splendidly than the women themselves.

As Zhao Ya opened the door, dozens of whimsical woodland flower spirits flew out in an orderly fashion, beginning to style and adorn their mistress, clearly familiar with the process.

Zhao Ya flipped through a book nearby, her voice soft as she read a popular poetry collection that had recently swept through the courts of Qingluan.

With a creak, the door swung open, yet no one entered.

Zhao Ya sighed inwardly, pretending nothing had occurred, and continued reading the landscape poem.

A gentle breeze flipped through the pages when suddenly, a handsome young man in a black robe appeared behind the girl, gently flicking away the little spirits that styled Liu Qingqing's hair, taking over the task himself.

The girl didn’t turn to look but smiled, "You’ve arrived."

The fox spirit, causing chaos in the Lion's Garden, smiled charmingly, "The mundane world is cruel, but it’s my wife who suffers."

Liu Qingqing shook her head slightly.

The fox spirit whispered, "Don't move; be careful of water splashing on you."

Liu Qingqing stayed still, tilting her head as the handsome young man gently worked on her silky hair, his touch calming her heart.

The fox spirit meticulously washed Liu Qingqing’s hair, applied rouge, and painted her eyebrows.

Finally, they sat shoulder to shoulder, and Liu Qingqing softly asked, "I heard from Ya’er that more people have come to the house."

The fox spirit, who introduced himself as "Old Master Qing," smiled. "They are difficult to gauge, possibly even more troublesome than that nun with the sword. But it doesn’t matter; even if true immortals come, I will come and go as I please, and I will certainly not miss a chance to see my lady."

A blush crept onto Liu Qingqing's cheeks as she turned to Zhao Ya. "Ya’er, please go downstairs and keep watch for me; no outsiders are allowed upstairs."

Zhao Ya nodded, closed the book, shut the little door of the birdcage, and went downstairs.

Liu Qingqing perked up her ears, and after confirming Zhao Ya was far enough away, she quietly asked, "My lord, can we really be together for a long time?"

The fox spirit gently traced her brow with a finger and smiled. "Of course, for eternity, far beyond a hundred years."

Liu Qingqing's expression darkened. "But what about my father? What will happen with the Lion's Garden?"

The fox spirit confidently replied, "I have always said that as long as your father agrees to our marriage, he will be my father-in-law. How could I possibly mistreat the Lion's Garden?"

Liu Qingqing nestled into his embrace, closing her eyes and trembling lashes. "I only hope my lord will not forsake me."

The fox spirit gazed down at her slightly less haggard face, smiling as he said, "Fox spirits are known for their infatuation. Why do you think so many foxes and hares dwell amidst scattered graves? It’s because they guard their kind."

---

When Chen Ping'an slowly opened his eyes, he realized he was propping himself up with his palm, and outside the window, the night had fallen.

He lightly tapped the ground, flipping himself upright and standing gracefully. Pushing the door open, he found Zhu Lian asleep at the table in the courtyard, beneath a sparse moonlit sky.

Zhu Lian smiled as he awoke, explaining, "Young Master was in a state similar to what Taoists call ‘ecstasy and forgetfulness.’ I dared not disturb you these past two days. For that reason, Pei Qian even sparred with me three times, forcibly keeping me inside. Tonight, she was standing on a chair, peering into the old master’s room for a long time, waiting for the lights to come on. Unfortunately, she has only just fallen asleep."

Chen Ping'an was surprised. "Has it already been two days?"

Zhu Lian nodded with a smile.

Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian sat down together, reflecting, "No wonder they say that those who cultivate on the mountain experience time slipping by like a finger snap."

Zhu Lian replied, "Indeed, we martial artists are straightforward; we practice our forms, eat, sleep, and upon waking, we fight."

Chen Ping'an ignored the comment about fighting upon waking and asked, "Have there been any developments in the Lion's Garden recently?"

Zhu Lian shook his head with a smile. "The skies are clear, the flowers are blooming, and the moon is full. It’s a pity to miss the imminent debate between Buddhism and Taoism in the capital. I feel somewhat sorry for you, young master."

Chen Ping'an, serious, stated, "If you long for the grand events in the capital... you must also stay at the Lion's Garden. Without you, Zhu Lian, it simply won’t work."

Zhu Lian, following the conversation, shook the nearly empty osmanthus wine gourd in his hand with a grin. "Then why not give me another flask? After drinking the osmanthus wine, the Lion's Garden’s liquor will taste like water."

Chen Ping'an refused. "Don’t even think about my osmanthus wine; there are only two jars left, and I can’t bear to drink them."

Zhu Lian sighed. "A beautiful time, fine wine, and a lovely person—this is something difficult to have all at once."

Chen Ping'an turned to serious matters. "A family that has done good deeds for generations will surely have their virtues protected in the afterlife. This is not mere talk. If I’m not mistaken, the Lion's Garden has excellent feng shui, and the Liu family’s virtue is solid; there should be descendants born with luck, and they would have the land god protecting them. It’s a pity that I lack the cultivation and powers of Cui Dongshan; I can’t summon the land god from the earth, or else I could learn more about that fox spirit’s background."

Zhu Lian glanced towards the main house. "Should I ask Shi Rou?"

Chen Ping'an questioned, "If she could do it, would she intentionally keep it hidden?"

Zhu Lian looked at Chen Ping'an and drained the last sip of osmanthus wine. "Allow me to say something rather bold; perhaps young master has calculated the worst actions those around him might take, yet when it comes to character, you are a bit too optimistic. You could stand to be more observant and discerning. Of course, this is due to your virtuous nature as a gentleman."

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment before nodding. "I’ll ask Shi Rou tomorrow. I still have some judgment regarding the truthfulness of others’ words."

Zhu Lian shook his head with a smile. "Why wait until tomorrow? Why not now? You are her master, and you’ve bestowed great favors upon her; a few words should be permissible. If I view Shi Rou only through my own lens, it would be akin to a lovesick fool gazing at a beauty. Naturally, one would cherish her, and it’s a sin to speak harshly. However, you don’t see her as such a soft-hearted individual, do you? Shi Rou's actions have been akin to a storm; do remember that those who don’t understand the world often fear authority but not virtue. She is not as discerning as your student Pei Qian."

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but laugh. "The sun must have risen in the west; you actually said something nice about Pei Qian."

Zhu Lian sighed. "Badness is pure; goodness is pure. Such an intriguing little girl is simply impossible to dislike."

At that moment, the main house door swung open, and Shi Rou stepped outside.

She walked over to the two, taking the initiative to speak. "Mr. Cui did indeed teach me a technique to summon the land god, but I worry that making too much noise might cause that fox spirit to grow wary and turn hostile."

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "Is your reasoning sound? I just want to ask you two things: First, are you more worried about the fox spirit targeting you, Shi Rou, or the three of us? Second, since you understand this side technique, capable of summoning the land, why not speak up if the matter can be avoided?"

Zhu Lian grinned, "That hit the nail on the head."

Shi Rou's gaze flickered uncertainly.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand. "We both know the answer to this; let it not be repeated. If there’s a next time, I’ll simply summon you out of this shell and return you to your talismans; once the sixty-year limit is up, you can still regain your freedom."

Shi Rou’s eyes turned cold.

Zhu Lian playfully pulled out a brocade pouch from his sleeve. After opening it, he took out a small origami folded to resemble a paper horse. "Before parting, Mr. Cui entrusted me with this item, saying that if his lady was angered by Shi Rou, I should present it to speak well of her. By the way, Miss Shi Rou, Mr. Cui specifically instructed me to give this to you first to read; the contents are for you to decide whether to share or not."

Zhu Lian watched from the sidelines, his heart brimming with malice, and he showed no sign of concealing it.

Even if that gentleman offered kindness without seeking repayment, it was hard to guarantee a good outcome, for the petty would turn favors into grudges.

This girl, who had received a monumental fortune as a ghost, might not have a particularly wicked heart; perhaps she had once been a decent spirit. But the human heart, with its minute details, when magnified by external influences, could reveal flaws as large as a sieve.

When virtue does not match position, it becomes the root of disaster.

Shi Rou’s heart was turbulent, and upon unfolding the paper horse, her body trembled slightly.

She clenched her fist, tightening her grip on the paper note, and said to Chen Ping'an with a trembling voice, "I understand my mistakes. I will summon the land god at once and ask for the truth!"

Regarding Shi Rou’s sudden change in attitude, Chen Ping'an was not particularly angry, simply nodding. "The fox spirit has already come here, provoking us first. Summoning the land god is no problem."

Shi Rou tucked the note into her sleeve, then stepped onto the path, her hands forming seals as she moved. From the celestial remnants of Du Mao, light and dark energies surged from her brow and the Yongquan point beneath her feet. As she silently recited the final incantation, "With a breath, the staff's tip echoes like thunder; a stomp sends the roots of the Five Mountains shaking," she stomped heavily onto the ground, and an ancient symbol flickered and vanished.

Shi Rou took a deep breath and stepped back a few paces.

Then, the ground before her rippled like water before suddenly spitting out a ragged old woman, who fell to the ground. The old woman wore a verdant willow crown, but her neck, wrists, and ankles were bound by five black ropes, leaving deep imprints.

The old woman could not stand, curled up on the ground, and raised her head to Shi Rou, who had freed her from captivity, pleading desperately, "Please, great immortal, save the Lion's Garden!"

Shi Rou’s expression remained cold. "You’ve prayed to the wrong Buddha."

The old woman, wearing the willow crown, turned her neck slightly, and the rope tightened even further, but she paid it no mind. Finally, she caught sight of the young man in white with a sword on his back. "Young immortal, please hurry and save Liu Jingtian’s daughter, Liu Qingqing. She is now under the fox spirit's demonic spell, bewitched, and does not truly love that fox spirit! This great demon, while having profound cultivation, is cruel in its methods, seeking to drain the Liu family's fortunes and transfer them to Liu Qingqing. This is an illegitimate and rebellious act; how can a mere mortal girl like her bear this...?"

The old woman was once again rendered speechless as the black ropes tightened around her, but after the verdant leaves of the willow crown wilted and disappeared, her complexion improved slightly.

Chen Ping'an still did not rush to sever the "Demon Binding Ropes." He asked, "But I know that the fox spirit’s lineage honors love above all; the Way does not stray from this character. Since that fox spirit is already of the Earth Immortal realm, it should not act so recklessly. What is the reason for this?"

The local deity shook her head. "I dare not deceive the immortal; I too do not know why and have pondered it endlessly. But the changes in the Lion's Garden are undeniable! Liu Jingtian’s sons, who were once the brightest hopes for the Liu family, have seen their paths completely severed, and the Liu family’s ancestral blessings and virtues are profound. How could Liu Qingshan suffer such unjust misfortune...?"

Once again, the old woman was unable to speak, and another willow leaf shriveled and vanished.

Chen Ping'an exchanged glances with Zhu Lian, who nodded slightly, indicating that the old woman did not seem to be deceitful.

With a tap of his sword gourd, he summoned the white rainbow-like flying sword, severing the five ropes binding the old woman.

The sword spirit left behind three shards of the Dragon-Slaying Platform, allowing the two little ancestors, the first and fifteenth, to feast on two of them; the remaining thin shard of sword stone was sold to Sui Youbian.

Now, the two flying swords were sharper than ever before.

The old woman was granted a reprieve, gingerly standing up and tearfully expressing her gratitude. "I was previously blind, but I humbly pay my respects to the sword immortal!"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "There’s no need for such formality."

Suddenly, the old woman knelt, unable to control her tears. "I plead with the sword immortal to act swiftly. Since you can save me, and are accompanied by a great master, slaying the great demon should be a simple task..."

Chen Ping'an was about to respond.

The old woman raised her head, fixing her gaze on him with a sorrowful expression. "For seven generations, the Liu family has been loyal and virtuous. Are you really going to watch this scholarly family be destroyed? Can you bear to let this great demon roam free?!"

Zhu Lian frowned. The old woman’s request was no different from that of the incense bearer; their methods, however, were worlds apart.

Shi Rou also felt displeased.

In this matter, the hunchbacked elder and the ghostly beauty were of the same ilk.

The old woman continued to bow repeatedly, looking intently at Chen Ping'an. "I implore the sword immortal to act, to save the day and slay the great demon! The sons of the Liu family will surely remember this great favor, dedicating incense to you for generations!"

Zhu Lian's expression darkened, ready to speak when Chen Ping'an gestured for him to remain silent.

Chen Ping'an reached out to assist the old woman. "Please stand and speak."

Yet the old woman pushed Chen Ping'an’s arm away, continuing to bow. "If the sword immortal does not act, my insignificant life is worthless; I will bow until I die."

Chen Ping'an could only crouch down, silent, gathering his thoughts.

Zhu Lian stood still, his toes grazing the ground, ready to kick the old woman to pieces. Whether a land deity or a lesser water spirit, even a minor local god would not withstand the might of an eighth-layer martial artist if Zhu Lian charged at them.

Shi Rou first scoffed at the old woman's demeanor, then coldly chuckled, glancing at Chen Ping'an, who seemed helpless.

She thought to herself, this was a mess of your own making.

Both Chen Ping'an, who was crouching, and Zhu Lian, who stood, turned to the eaves, where the Daoist nun stood high above, wearing a fish-tail crown.

She glanced at the local deity who had been freed by the flying sword and sneered. "A frog at the bottom of a well, coarse and unrefined. No wonder you can’t save a family in distress like the Lion's Garden."

She looked at the red wine gourd and raised her arm, pinching her fingers as if looking down upon the world, transforming her eyes into golden orbs, realizing, "So it’s a high-quality sword nurturing gourd, which allows you to easily sever those shabby ropes."

Chen Ping'an asked, "You only slay demons, and do not save people?"

The Daoist nun retorted, "Why would I?"

Chen Ping'an smiled. "Then I’ll save people; you just focus on slaying demons."

The nun hesitated for a moment. "That would be best."

The old woman was overjoyed at this response, remaining on her knees, grasping Chen Ping'an's arm tightly, filled with hope. "Sword immortal, please hurry to the embroidery building to save her; I will lead the way."

This time, there was no need for Chen Ping'an to support her; the old woman nearly pulled him to his feet, eager to head towards the courtyard gate. However, she noticed that the young sword immortal stood still, as immovable as a mountain. She frowned slightly. "Why doesn’t the immortal move? Saving a person is like saving a fire; if we delay..."

Chen Ping'an’s expression remained calm as he gently explained, "I still have a disciple to wake, and they need to stay with me. Otherwise, the fox spirit might take the opportunity to slip in. Also, I need to inform Liu Old Minister that we’ll be entering Liu Qingqing’s embroidery building; these two matters shouldn’t take too much time..."

Before Chen Ping'an could finish, the old woman hurriedly complained, "Sword immortal, you are a mountain dweller. Why bother with these formalities? Just leave one person to watch over your disciple. As for Liu Jingtian, his family is on the brink of collapse; why concern yourself with such trivial matters? You can tell him later that you've saved his daughter; that bookish fellow will surely be grateful and won’t dare to worry about these trivialities!"

Zhu Lian observed the old woman’s profile.

Zhu Lian's hand, already behind his back, clenched into a fist, cracking audibly.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, "Have you heard of the saying, a gentleman does not save?"

The old woman was left stunned, fear creeping in.

Yet Chen Ping'an’s next actions allowed the old woman’s heart, which had been in her throat, to finally relax.

He instructed Zhu Lian to hurry and explain the situation to Liu Jingtian.

He told Shi Rou to wake Pei Qian.

Chen Ping'an gently brushed the dust off the old woman’s sleeve, leaning down to softly say, "Do not worry, old woman. I will save those who need saving. I just hope the Lion's Garden can survive this trial. If we encounter similar situations in the future, I will act within my means to help."

Arriving at the base of the embroidery building, Zhu Lian had already returned, nodding to indicate that Liu Old Minister had agreed.

Chen Ping'an then ascended the stairs.

Pei Qian, still groggy, followed behind, the yellow talisman on her forehead giving her courage, so she felt less afraid as long as she was near her master.

Shi Rou closely followed behind.

Zhu Lian stood at the bottom, hesitating to move, simply watching Chen Ping'an’s ascending figure.

The hunchbacked elder craned her neck, scratching her head, feeling that this Mr. Cui’s master walked at an impressive height.

(End of Chapter)### Chapter 393: The Coming Storm at Xiulou

This was Chen Ping'an's first time entering the Xiulou and its inner chambers.

He left Zhu Lian and Pei Qian outside, bringing only Shi Rou with him.

Before entering, Chen Ping'an knocked on the door and explained that Liu Old Minister hoped they could check on Miss Liu's room for any concealed fox demons.

Moments later, Liu Qingqing finished her makeup and instructed her maid, Zhao Ya, to open the door.

Chen Ping'an recognized the maid as the daughter of the old steward. She was a gentle girl, but her focus was more on the rumors of Miss Liu being enchanted by a fox demon.

At first glance, upon seeing Liu Qingqing, Chen Ping'an felt that the rumors might be somewhat exaggerated. A person's demeanor often reflects their inner state; it was easy to feign dullness, but hard to disguise clarity and brilliance.

Chen Ping'an felt a sense of relief but also a new worry: the pressing issue at hand might be easier to resolve than he imagined, yet human hearts were like mirrors—fragile and difficult to mend.

However, that was just the fate of this young girl. Chen Ping'an could save her, but he could not mend the heart of a woman he had just met, nor would he attempt to do so.

Though Liu Qingqing was a daughter of a notable family with relatively few restrictions, she had encountered many talented scholars from Qingluan Country. There was even a cage in her chamber where she raised a spirit bird. Still, she was quite curious about true celestial figures and mountain practitioners. So when she saw a young man who wasn’t particularly handsome but had a gentle demeanor, her apprehensions eased a bit. After all, this was a young maiden's private quarters; allowing an outsider to enter was bound to make her feel uneasy. What if he were a brutish warrior or a so-called immortal with ulterior motives? How would she handle that?

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists in apology, "Our actions may not be in accordance with etiquette, but both Liu Old Minister and the Earth God of Shiziyuan are worried about Miss Liu's well-being. I hope Miss Liu can forgive us. My surname is Chen, and this is my companion, Shi."

Only then did Liu Qingqing notice the elderly man behind the young swordsman in white. His gaze was somewhat indifferent. She forced a smile, "Chen Xianshi and Shi Xianpei have come to save me, so there’s no need to stand on ceremony. Please feel free to search as you wish."

Zhao Ya felt a bit awkward. Miss is really something; at the very first thought of this unscheduled visit, she worried that other men had entered the chamber. If that young man in black found out, would he feel displeased?

Zhao Ya had initially been quite afraid of the handsome young man who was actually a fox demon. The first time they met, she had been so frightened that she grabbed a pair of scissors, ready to fight off the intruder, only to be stopped by her mistress. After spending some time together, Zhao Ya had tried to persuade her mistress several times but to no avail, watching as her health gradually declined. All she could do was suppress her sorrow and try her best to tend to her mistress's needs.

Chen Ping'an pulled out a talisman infused with Yang energy and ignited it; the sparks were small but visible.

It was clear that a fox demon had indeed been here. Chen Ping'an moved around the room slowly, checking every corner. He noticed that the talisman burned slightly faster near the huanghuali wood vanity and the bed.

Throughout the process, his expression remained calm.

Liu Qingqing and Zhao Ya were both outsiders to cultivation, unable to discern the meaning behind the varying speeds of the talismans burning, and they might not even notice the slight differences.

Shi Rou, on the other hand, silently scoffed in her heart, harboring a bit of disdain for the seemingly delicate and graceful Liu Qingqing. What if she was a daughter of a family of etiquette? Wasn't she just as full of desires and faults as anyone else?

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an recalled a dilemma. He had always regarded Shi Rou as the earliest suppressed ghost, even after her soul was transferred into the remains of an immortal. He still habitually viewed her as a woman. Yet, there were certain covert methods involving the binding of souls and nurturing evil spirits within acupoints—like how the evil cultivator at Feiying Fort bred a ghost fetus in the heart of the fort master's wife. Chen Ping'an wasn't skilled in breaking such methods. Shi Rou, being a ghost herself and having undergone the process of refining the immortal's remains, along with secretly learning from Cui Dongshan, was quite knowledgeable about such insidious practices and had a sharper intuition.

However, Shi Rou was currently walking the mortal realm in the guise of "Du Mao," which made things a bit troublesome.

If Liu Qingqing insisted on not allowing Shi Rou to touch her or help check her pulse, insisting on crying or throwing a fit, it could become quite a headache.

Chen Ping'an walked over to Zhao Ya, the talisman still burning steadily. Curious, Zhao Ya asked about it. After receiving Chen Ping'an's permission, she reached out to touch the yellow paper talisman, finding it warm but not hot. Chen Ping'an smiled as he approached Liu Qingqing. The remaining small piece of the talisman suddenly flared up, igniting into a flame the size of a hand before burning out completely.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Miss Liu, has that young man given you any tokens of affection? Is there anything you might have inadvertently carried on you?"

His words were subtle and gentle, not meant to offend.

Liu Qingqing hesitated, wanting to say something but holding back.

Zhao Ya whispered, "Miss, what are you waiting for?"

Seeing Zhao Ya's pleading gaze, Liu Qingqing turned away and finally produced a colorful silk sachet that she had tied to her waist, embroidered with a pair of mandarin ducks.

Chen Ping'an inquired, "May I take a look?"

Liu Qingqing shook her head, refusing.

Zhao Ya was nearly frantic.

Chen Ping'an's eyes were clear, "Miss Liu, your feelings are sincere and I, as an outsider, dare not intrude. However, if this endangers your entire family, what if—just what if—Miss Liu has entrusted her heart to the wrong person? After pouring out your feelings, the other party might have ulterior motives. In the end, how would Miss Liu handle it? Even if we don't consider the most extreme possibilities, or whether Miss Liu and that young man are truly in love, let's just discuss the sachet. If I look at it, it won't diminish your feelings for that young man. Yet it could ease your conscience regarding the Liu family and Shiziyuan."

As he spoke, Chen Ping'an recalled his first long journey to the Great Sui, traveling with Zhu He and his daughter Zhu Lu.

Young Zhu Lu was willing to fly into the flames for the second son of the Li family from Fulu Street, Li Baozhen, and did so without a second thought, feeling no regrets.

Liu Qingqing's eyes turned red, trembling as she handed over the beloved sachet.

The guilt towards her lover grew heavier, and giving up the sachet felt like tearing out her heart. With empty hands, her heart felt even emptier, and she turned away in tears.

Chen Ping'an received the sachet and examined it closely. It was made of five colors of silk, with the black thread being made from the fox fur that had previously fallen to the ground. The origins of the other four colors remained unknown for now.

Opening the sachet revealed only some trinkets for a Qiqiao Festival. Chen Ping'an was worried he might overlook something significant, so he turned to Shi Rou, who also shook her head, softly stating, "The sachet is like a lantern glowing at night, making it easy for the fox demon to find this young lady. The items inside likely have no much significance."

Chen Ping'an handed the sachet to Shi Rou. "You keep it for now."

In addition, Chen Ping'an conjured the binding talisman he had refined at the Upside-Down Mountain, using the golden dragon whiskers of the old dragon in the Jiao Long River as the core of the magical tool. Among the myriad artifacts in the world, it was quite impressive. Shi Rou took the sachet and tucked it into her sleeve, holding onto the striking golden binding talisman, feeling a little less resentment. The sachet felt like a disaster waiting to happen, but with the binding talisman by her side, it was Chen Ping'an's way of making up for the situation.

Chen Ping'an spoke to Liu Qingqing, "Please allow us to check your pulse. Many mountain methods are deeply concealed, and the method of simply observing one's aura might not reveal much."

First entering her quarters, then asking for the sachet, and now needing to check her pulse—it was becoming quite a lot for Liu Qingqing.

She felt utterly devastated, her face streaked with tears. She glared at Chen Ping'an, her voice choked, "Are you trying to take advantage of me? After checking my pulse, will you ask me to remove my clothes before you’ll be satisfied?"

Chen Ping'an replied calmly, "Of course not."

Liu Qingqing was furious and embarrassed, turning away to lean on the huanghuali vanity, her shoulders shaking as she sobbed, "I want to see my father... If he were here... he wouldn't allow you to humiliate me like this."

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and said to Shi Rou, "I'll protect you. Reveal your true form and help her check her pulse."

Though Shi Rou held various prejudices against Chen Ping'an, one thing she had no doubt about was that he would always keep his word.

Thus, Zhao Ya saw the old man's body transform, revealing a beautiful woman in colorful robes, both real and ethereal, which took her breath away.

Zhao Ya hurriedly exclaimed, "Miss, look!"

Before Liu Qingqing turned her head, she wiped her tears and saw a woman whose beauty surpassed her own.

Meanwhile, the elderly man remained motionless, as if dozing off.

Shi Rou's expression was unfazed, "Extend your hand."

Liu Qingqing, dazed, raised her arm.

Shi Rou grasped Liu Qingqing's wrist, which was as delicate as a white lotus.

As Shi Rou examined the flow of Liu Qingqing's internal energy, Chen Ping'an, still observing the room, suddenly noticed that Zhao Ya was signaling him. Following Zhao Ya's gaze, Chen Ping'an spotted a beautifully crafted small box, not yet put away in a drawer, presumably for cosmetics. He silently approached, opened it, and found several pills inside, exuding a faint, pungent odor. He pretended to notice it by chance, turning to Liu Qingqing to ask, "May I ask, Miss Liu, are these pills from Shiziyuan's own concoction, or gifts from outside celestial figures?"

Zhao Ya thought this swordsman in white was truly perceptive and considerate, always thinking of others.

If it had been other celestial figures before, they would have been arrogant, practically sticking “immortal” labels on their foreheads, while also disparaging the fox demon in front of Liu Qingqing, which was painful to hear.

Liu Qingqing replied timidly, "These are the heart-calming pills he gave me, saying they would nourish my body and calm my spirit."

Shi Rou had already caught a whiff of the pungent odor and scoffed, "Heart-calming pills? Do you know what a real heart-calming pill is? This is one of the side methods for nurturing ghosts and making puppets. After taking it, the soul of a living person or a ghost gradually solidifies, and their essence becomes fixed. The originally free and unbound Three Souls and Seven Spirits are like clay for making ceramics, and in the end, they become mere vessels."

Shi Rou continued mockingly, "Of course, it’s possible that Miss Liu's lover says this is a superior secret technique from the mountain to mend the deficiencies of the younger generation in the Liu family, helping those without cultivation talent rise to greatness. Such words are not entirely false, but those mountain caves willing to do so are either insignificant or in dire situations, requiring shortcuts for their younger disciples. After all, taking a pill known as the 'decapitation pill' leads to endless troubles, leaving one half-dead—neither human nor ghost. The most ruthless fate is to become a good vessel for carrying the spiritual essence of mountains and waters, only to have one's "piggy bank" smashed, leaving one empty-handed. As for the fate of that broken vessel—well, either their soul dissipates with no afterlife, or if their spirit remains, they will become a malevolent ghost."

Shi Rou's words were blunt.

Zhao Ya's complexion turned pale upon hearing this.

Liu Qingqing was initially frightened but still unwilling to give up. Soon, she found a rational explanation, thinking that this woman simply had a narrow view and couldn't see the deeper significance of the heart-calming pills.

Chen Ping'an's expression darkened.

Such celestial methods.

Didn't it resemble the crafting of life ceramics in Lihuzhu Cave?

If Chen Ping'an had initially changed his route, choosing to come to Shiziyuan instead of heading to the capital because of the scholar mentioned by the River God’s temple, and for that saying, "Where there are demons causing trouble, there must be a heavenly master with a peach wood sword," because he thought of his good friend Zhang Shanfeng, who was an outsider heavenly master from Longhu Mountain. If Zhang Shanfeng hadn't followed his master to Longhu Mountain and heard of this matter, he would definitely have come here.

Now, Chen Ping'an truly did not believe in evil. A potential calamity that might even be disguising as a fox demon could cause trouble, meddling with the Liu family's literary fortune, not to mention endangering lives—such malicious intent and ruthless tactics were simply unforgivable.

Chen Ping'an went to the door, first allowing Pei Qian to enter the chamber before instructing Zhu Lian to immediately go to Shiziyuan and ask for gold coins from the imperial family, to be ground into powder to create more exquisite gold paint.

He needed to draw talismans to suppress the evil!

---

As the elderly woman of Shiziyuan's land god, she did not follow them to Xiulou, reasoning that with Chen Xianshi present, Liu Qingqing would be temporarily safe. She needed to protect the many Liu family members, including Liu Old Minister.

In the Liu family ancestral hall, the elderly woman, no longer bound by the five fox demon ropes, was full of spirit.

In fact, the Liu family’s past heads had all known this Liu Shun Niang, who was older than Shiziyuan. Each year, during the rituals to honor their ancestors, she received a significant portion of offerings that protected the Liu family.

At this moment, the ancestral hall was crowded with people, and many servants who originally had no right to enter were brought in by Liu Old Minister and the steward, Old Zhao. If word got out, Liu Old Minister would surely be branded with the label of "dishonoring the family and desecrating the ancestors."

Liu Old Minister and more than twenty Liu family members were gathered in a secluded corner of the hall. Many were seeing Liu Shun Niang for the first time.

Additionally, two outsiders who had lived in Shiziyuan for many years stood at the edge, not daring to meddle in Liu family affairs.

Shiziyuan had a family school. Thirty years ago, a revered scholar resigned, and an inconspicuous teacher was hired.

This was quite a curious matter. At the time, both the court and the literary circles were curious about who this scholar was that Liu Old Minister held in such high regard to teach the Liu family’s children.

However, Liu Old Minister's eldest son performed well in the imperial examination but lacked brilliance. He was only a Jinshi, and his rank was rather low. His essays and poetry were mediocre, falling short compared to the eloquent Liu Old Minister, leading to a lack of curiosity about the new teacher's identity. After all, how good could a teacher be if the students didn’t shine?

As for Liu Qingshan, he was a prodigy in his youth, renowned like his father Liu Jingteng, but this was due to his own talents, not the teacher's knowledge.

At this moment, Liu Jingteng was in a heated argument with Liu Shun Niang.

Liu Shun Niang's view was that no matter what, they must strive to request that young man Chen to take action against the demon. They must not allow him to only save people without killing the demon; he must eradicate the threat entirely.

Liu Jingteng mentioned the matter of the female Daoist who had eliminated the fox demon's illusion.

Liu Shun Niang scoffed. "If Shiziyuan places all its hopes on an outsider Daoist, the outcome won't be good."

Liu Qingya, the eldest daughter, timidly added, "But that Chen Xianshi is also an outsider..."

Liu Shun Niang shot a sideways glance at the short-sighted girl, causing her to hastily shut her mouth.

Then the elderly woman made a thought-provoking statement: "That young man named Chen is at least a learned scholar!"

After weighing the situation, Liu Jingteng was still unwilling to use underhanded tactics to tie the young man to Shiziyuan.

Liu Shun Niang pointed a finger at Liu Old Minister's nose and scolded him mercilessly, "The Liu family has worked hard for seven generations to reach this point. If you Liu Jingteng die, the incense will be severed in your hands. Do you have the face to meet your ancestors? Do you honor the names on the tablets in Shiziyuan’s ancestral hall? For the sake of preserving the Tang family's orthodoxy, you would die for it. For the sake of loyal and righteous subjects, you would die exiled three thousand miles. For the sake of benefiting the people, you would die exhausted and drained. Do I need to remind you of their names?"

Liu Jingteng was filled with sorrow.

The elderly woman continued to admonish him, "If you don't have the thick skin to maintain this facade of being an old minister, then your Liu family will never get past this hurdle. If you Liu Jingteng die, it will be worse than changing the Liu surname and scattering your children. With so many rare books in the library, how many can be preserved by Liu Qingshan's generation?"

Liu Jingteng was left speechless.

The others dared not speak either.

After a long silence, the atmosphere grew heavy.

Finally, limping forward a few steps, Liu Qingshan addressed the elderly woman, "Liu Shun Niang, it seems you’ve said something incorrectly."

The elderly woman squinted, "Oh? What does this little boy have to teach me?"

Liu Qingshan spoke seriously, "The reason our Liu family has been able to pass down through the generations, with incense burning bright, is due to the righteous foundation laid by our ancestors, the family rules left behind, and the strict adherence of the descendants. This is how we have today’s Shiziyuan—when there is trouble, help comes from all directions. If we act against our principles today, even if we manage to keep Shiziyuan, the Liu family’s integrity will be lost from this day forth."

The elderly woman burst into laughter, mocking, "Little boy, don’t think that just because you’ve read a few books, you can discuss these trivial matters with an old woman. Once everyone is dead, a hundred years from now, aside from the Shiziyuan anthology, who will remember the fallen Liu family?"

Not giving the scholar Liu Qingshan a chance to speak, the elderly woman continued to laugh, "You, a cripple with no hope for fame, have the audacity to spout such nonsense? Ha! Liu Qingshan, can you even stand properly now?"

Liu Qingshan had secretly left Shiziyuan with an old immortal to seek true celestial masters to save his sister, but on the way, disaster struck. His crippled leg was a physical pain, but the real tragedy was that his path to an official career was cut off, and all his ambitions were dashed. This was Liu Qingshan’s greatest sorrow as a scholar. For this reason, Zhao Ya had not dared to mention this tragic incident to Liu Qingqing, as she had been closest to her second brother Liu Qingshan since childhood. If Liu Qingqing found out, she would undoubtedly feel overwhelming guilt. In fact, Liu Qingshan had requested his father Liu Jingteng to hide this matter from his sister as soon as he was brought back to Shiziyuan.

Now, having his deepest scars exposed by the elderly land god, Liu Qingshan, despite being a scholar who had never lost his composure in front of outsiders, turned pale, clenching his fists tightly.

The elderly woman continued to pour salt into the young scholar's wounds, "Before you were crippled, I still respected you. Now that you are a cripple, your fate is sealed to be a useless person waiting to die in Shiziyuan. I advise you to take down those couplets in your study; aren’t you ashamed?!"

Liu Jingteng's face turned dark. "Liu Shun Niang, please stop while you’re ahead!"

The elderly woman snorted coldly.

Liu Jingteng patted his second son's shoulder.

Liu Qingshan, teary-eyed, nodded to his father, the person he respected most in the world, signaling that he was fine, then lowered his head, his face wet with tears.

In this world, when a man sheds tears, it must mean his heart is broken.

Shiziyuan's family school had two teachers: a stern elderly man and a gentle middle-aged scholar.

The latter frowned.

The old man shook his head gently, and the middle-aged scholar remained silent.

Just then, Old Zhao, the steward who had been waiting outside Xiulou, hurried into the ancestral hall. Reaching Liu Old Minister and Liu Shun Niang, he wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, "Young Master Chen wants us to prepare gold paint for drawing talismans. He needs gold coins from the imperial family ground into powder. Young Master Chen said the more, the better, and then he’ll draw talismans at Xiulou."

The elderly woman said sharply, "What are you waiting for? Hurry and prepare! This little bit of yellow and white is nothing!"

Old Zhao turned to look at Liu Jingteng.

Liu Old Minister nodded, "Go."

Suddenly, Liu Jingteng called Old Zhao back, striding out. "Old Zhao, I’ll go with you, and call some brave young men to come along, but they must volunteer."

Unexpectedly, the elderly woman grabbed Liu Jingteng's shoulder, "You're going? Liu Jingteng, have you lost your mind? If that fox demon throws caution to the wind and kills you, the mainstay of our family, even if your daughter survives, Shiziyuan will still be in ruins. Who will support this family? A cripple, or a son who can barely manage to become a county magistrate?"

Liu Jingteng was filled with fury.

Did he think all these years in the officialdom were for nothing? The elderly land god was so anxious—what was she worried about? Ultimately, wasn’t it about the Liu family’s incense being severed and how it would affect her own path to transcendence?

Seeing Liu Jingteng unusually angry, the elderly woman hesitated slightly, softening her tone to advise, "A scholar reminds you, gentlemen should not stand under a dangerous wall. You, a weak scholar, can’t move even a few gold coins, less than any young man working in Shiziyuan. What use are you? Aren’t you afraid the fox demon will capture you as leverage against Shiziyuan?"

Liu Qingshan suddenly raised his head, his gaze resolute, "I’ll go. Even if I can’t move many gold coins, just keeping an eye on things can prevent some mistakes."

Liu Jingteng adjusted his second son's robe, "Be careful. If you’re not an official, so what? A scholar who occupies a high position with an unworthy heart is no true scholar. My son is crippled and cannot become an official, but he can still be a scholar for life. Since he cannot govern the world, he must at least cultivate his character and manage his family. Can you do that?"

Liu Qingshan finally smiled, "Father, this is not difficult."

Liu Qingshan followed Old Zhao and took a group of eager young servants from Shiziyuan, leaving the ancestral hall with a spirited demeanor.

Liu Jingteng ignored the elderly woman and approached the two foreign teachers, bowing in gratitude, "Thank you, Master Fu, and Teacher Liu, for teaching my Liu family a scholar who can carry on the family’s integrity."

The old teacher remained expressionless, even failing to nod lightly. Fortunately, the people of Shiziyuan were used to it; the old man always had that stoic face.

The middle-aged scholar smiled, "It is the duty of a teacher to impart knowledge and resolve doubts."

---

In a small courtyard lived four chivalrous figures who had come from afar, having arrived at Shiziyuan earlier than Chen Ping'an.

The young nobleman with the surname Dugu, along with his maid Meng Long, and two disciple-practitioners who each raised a little raccoon and a green snake.

They met by chance, having suppressed a mountain teeming with demons together. The Dugu young master contributed more but only selected some common items associated with elegance, leaving the rare spiritual tools and a large pile of celestial coins for the master and disciple.

Privately, the pair thought that their lives were likely not worth the Dugu young man’s time to fish for something bigger, so they boldly mingled with the pair, ultimately gaining some benefits. After two demon-clearing missions, they acquired several hundred snowflake coins. Of course, the old practitioner was cautious and probing; the young nobleman claimed to come from the Zhu Ying Dynasty and truly didn’t seem to be fighting over wealth.

The young master had never taken action, claiming to be a mere ruffian with a bit of three-legged cat skills. The master and disciple were not foolish, naturally not believing him.

However, the maid’s several frightening encounters were truly impressive.

She was a swordswoman.

Not only that, but she could also utilize the legendary celestial arts to command a night-dwelling deity standing three zhang tall!

Maid Meng Long was not some old hag with eternal youth but a real girl who was less than twenty years old.

A promising swordswoman about to ascend to the Middle Five Realms. Her fierce attacks clearly indicated that she had already reached the level of Cave Dweller.

Treating a genius with great hopes of becoming an earth immortal swordsman as a mere servant, while the latter considered that quite normal.

Anyone with a bit of sense knew that the Dugu young master’s background was profound.

Unfortunately, the old man racked his brains but couldn’t think of any significant figures from the Zhu Ying Dynasty with the surname Dugu. Searching north and south yielded two prominent families or sects, either being pillars of the national court or having Golden Core guardians. However, compared to the young man’s emerging background, they still didn’t match.

After much thought, he assumed that in the Zhu Ying Dynasty, where swordsmen flourished, there were too many hidden old turtles, and the young man must have come from a discreet celestial residence.

This was also the reason why the wild practitioner and disciple dared to encourage the master and servant to come to Shiziyuan to exorcise demons.

At this moment, the Dugu young master stood by the window, looking at the unusual weather outside. "It seems that fox demon has stepped on the tail of that Chen fellow. The better, we won’t have to act. It’s just a pity about the three items in Shiziyuan; those paintings and the plum blossom vase are truly exquisite offerings. I wonder if that Chen fellow will be willing to part with them after he succeeds."

Maid Meng Long smiled, "Those who know the value are all eyeing that ancestral treasure left in Liu's hands, while the young master only desires those trifles worth a few celestial coins."

The Dugu young master sighed, "After this matter, we’ll have to rush around again."

Meng Long frowned, "Finding people and clues like this is like searching for a needle in a haystack; it seems quite difficult."

The young man helplessly replied, "There are no other shortcuts; we can only use the most cumbersome methods. Let’s treat this as a leisure trip—wandering around while waiting for news from the mountain."

Meng Long felt a surge of anger, "We found the ones willing to talk, yet still learned nothing. As for those who refuse to speak, they all have significant backgrounds, and we can’t openly reveal our identities. We can't provoke those fellows, who rely on their status in the Gulu Prefecture, pretending to be above others. What’s so impressive about them? They just rely on having lived a few hundred years longer and having slightly higher realms. I reckon that in less than thirty years, the young master could handle them with one hand."

The Dugu young master ignored the maid's complaints. "First, let’s find that young woman."

Meng Long sat at the table, idly fiddling with the chess pieces on the board, moving them randomly. "We only know her name, and she was just an unknown little practitioner on that ferry to Da Jiao Mountain. The clues are simply too scarce. If it weren’t for that wandering monk mentioning her, we would have been spinning in circles. Young master, I’m missing home a bit. But you can’t trick me; once we find that little practitioner, we’ll be heading back home, okay?"

The Dugu young master turned to jest, "Oh? You, a Qi Practitioner in the Lower Five Realms, have the audacity to call others little practitioners?"

Meng Long smiled sweetly, "But at least I’m a swordswoman."

The Dugu young master feigned anger, "A swordswoman is a greedy one; what’s so worthy of boasting about?"

Meng Long covered her mouth and giggled, "That’s something others can say but not you, young master. The celestial coins I’ve already spent, I’ll definitely earn back in the future. And in your family, is it not just a drop in the bucket?"

The Dugu young master shook his head, "When you truly reach the Middle Five Realms, you won’t talk like this. A celestial sword cultivator’s training costs at least double that of an ordinary earthly celestial."

Meng Long nodded softly, "Both my lord and lady truly spend money like water; otherwise, we wouldn’t be inferior to the Fu family of the Old Dragon City."

The Dugu young master laughed angrily, "You’ve gotten bold, daring to speak ill of my parents to my face?"

Meng Long acted coyly, "Young master is so nice; what do I have to fear?"

The Dugu young master chuckled, "It’s only a matter of time before you’re married off, and I’ll become a big fool."

Meng Long shook her head, "I don’t want to marry; what’s the point of marrying those flowery pillows? I’ll follow the young master for life."

The Dugu young master remained noncommittal, turning to gaze at the sky again. "That fox demon’s actions are quite peculiar and very difficult to deal with. I hope that young man, along with that knife-wielding female Daoist, can handle it safely."

Meng Long smiled, "You truly have a kind heart."

The Dugu young master self-deprecatingly said, "I’m just hoping to get those two items without lifting a finger. As for what happens inside and outside Shiziyuan, I have little interest. Whether it ends well or poorly, whether they live or die, it’s all self-inflicted."

---

About half an hour later at Xiulou, Zhu Lian, the old steward, and Liu Qingshan arrived, each carrying a jar-sized container of specially prepared gold paint.

Inside Xiulou, Shi Rou's ghostly form had returned to the remains of the immortal, sitting in a corner with her eyes closed, resting.

Pei Qian, at first, regretted that she couldn't copy books, as that would have spared her from one less task, making her wait in utter boredom.

Later, Zhao Ya found it amusing to see the little girl with a talisman on her forehead, so she approached to chat, and as they exchanged words, she brought along the previously shy Pei Qian to observe the spirit bird cage, letting her gaze in awe.

Old steward and Liu Qingshan did not ascend the building and returned to the ancestral hall together.

Before leaving, Liu Qingshan bowed toward Xiulou.

Inside, Chen Ping'an took the brush, while Zhu Lian stood beside him, holding the ceramic jar filled with gold paint, acting as an improvised inkstone. He began drawing talismans on a column.

These were talismans Chen Ping'an had learned from the "True Calligraphy of Alchemy" gifted by Li Xisheng.

Dipping the brush into the gold paint, the bristles became saturated.

Without needing Chen Ping'an to say much, Zhu Lian chuckled, "Young master, please."

With a tip of his toes, Chen Ping'an soared into the air, placing a foot on Zhu Lian's shoulder, and began painting a talisman for suppressing demons at the top of the column, finishing in one go.

Zhu Lian slightly crouched before using his golden robes and the accumulated spiritual energy from the Water Mansion to draw another talisman for suppressing demons in a different manner.

After the two were done, Chen Ping'an stepped onto Zhu Lian's shoulder again and covered the beams in every corner with talismans.

Once on the ground, he continued drawing talismans on the window walls and the windows, including not only the most targeted suppressing talismans, but also the simplest calming and cleansing talismans from the True Calligraphy of Alchemy, as well as several Yang Energy Lantern talismans at the entrance.

During this time, Zhu Lian softly asked, "Young master, do you want to take a break?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "That fox demon might already be on its way here; we can’t delay. Every additional talisman drawn is beneficial."

Having completed the talismans in the inner chamber, Chen Ping'an had used up most of the gold paint and then moved to the outer corridor, continuing to draw suppressing talismans on the railings and also trying out a few Sword Command talismans and Binding Lock talismans, which were relatively more strenuous.

The talisman was completed, but how long the spiritual light would last and how well it could withstand the evil demon’s attacks were separate matters.

Chen Ping'an could only work like a diligent farmer, knowing his land was poor and not fertile, maximizing the yield with quantity.

With paint still remaining in the jar, Chen Ping'an stood on the outer corridor railing, soaring up to the roof with Zhu Lian, squatting on the ridge to draw talismans.

Pei Qian finally found her chance to show off. Earlier, when Chen Ping'an had just begun drawing talismans, she had boasted to Maid Zhao Ya, crossing her arms and tilting her head high, "Sister Ya, my master’s talisman-drawing skills are impressive, right? Don’t you think those floral patterns are beautiful? Isn’t it quite elegant?"

Zhao Ya, not being a practitioner, couldn’t discern the depth of Chen Ping'an’s talisman skills, but as Liu Qingqing’s personal maid, she had a good eye for the arts. She didn’t find the brushwork in the white-clad immortal’s talismans particularly remarkable, but since Pei Qian asked, she had to come up with a few perfunctory praises to avoid disappointing the little girl.

Unexpectedly, after hearing Zhao Ya's few dry compliments, Pei Qian shook her head vigorously, "Sister Ya, you don’t understand. My master’s writing has... an aura of immortality!"

Pei Qian was quite pleased with this spontaneous explanation.

Zhao Ya couldn’t help but chuckle, pretending to realize, "So that’s it! I’m sorry for my blindness. After all, I’m not one of your mountain immortals; I can’t see the true essence."

Pei Qian saw through her insincere flattery, rolled her eyes at her, and, not wanting to say more, continued to lean over the table, wide-eyed, admiring the scenery within the spirit bird cage.

A gaze met another.

Many peculiar spirits and charms from within the cage flew out of the attic to look at the little girl in black.

Zhao Ya moved closer to Liu Qingqing, surprised, "Miss, do you feel that? The room seems fresher and brighter!"

Liu Qingqing bitterly replied, "I don’t feel anything."

Zhao Ya moved a stool next to her, gently taking her mistress's cold hand.

Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian descended back to the outer corridor, and Zhu Lian, with empty hands, asked Shi Rou to carry the remaining two jars of gold paint. Shi Rou, not understanding, complied. This eighth realm martial artist was someone she couldn’t afford to offend. Previously, Zhu Lian had exuded a frightening aura, directly targeting Shi Rou, leaving her quite terrified.

Pei Qian saw Chen Ping'an covered in sweat and hurried over. "Master, let me wipe your sweat?"

Chen Ping'an smiled and shook his head, "I’m going with Shi Rou to continue drawing talismans all around Shiziyuan. That way, if there’s any sign of trouble, the talismans will respond. Zhu Lian is here to protect you, so you won’t be in much danger. Even if the fox demon comes, as long as it doesn’t break through the doors and windows of Xiulou for a while, I can come back."

Pei Qian patted the bamboo sword at her waist, nodding, "Don’t worry, Master! I will protect Miss Liu and Sister Ya!"

Chen Ping'an patted her on the head, softly saying, "Take care of yourself first."

Pei Qian beamed with joy.

Zhu Lian smiled without saying a word.

Previously on the roof, Chen Ping'an had quietly instructed him to protect Pei Qian.

The implication of that made Zhu Lian feel quite at ease.

If he were to follow someone gradually becoming a moral sage, aiming for the status of a deity in the Temple of Literature, Zhu Lian would only feel troubled.

Chen Ping'an and Shi Rou floated down from Xiulou to the courtyard.

Chen Ping'an instructed Shi Rou, "You go inform the Dugu young master and those Daoist practitioners. If they are willing, they should guard near the ancestral hall, preferably choosing a high spot with a clear view. The fox demon might show up somewhere soon."

Shi Rou quietly left to deliver the message.

By an arched bridge in Shiziyuan, a black-robed young man faced off against the Daoist woman wielding a sword, both confronting each other.

The handsome young man leaned against the bridge rail, turning the rail into dust, "You stubborn Daoist, are you really going to block me?"

The female Daoist stood on the railing, shaking her head, "Block? I’m here to kill you and take your treasure."

The handsome young man’s expression changed slightly.

The female Daoist sneered, "Coveting worldly literary fortune, you demon, you have crossed the line more than once."

The handsome young man gritted his teeth, "Aren’t you curious why, as a demon, I can so brazenly scheme in the capital, right beside the Tang Emperor?"

The middle-aged female Daoist pressed her hand on the sword at her waist, "Earthly trivialities have nothing to do with me."

*(End of Chapter)*### Chapter 394: The Awakening of Spiritual Light as the Mountain Turns Green

The handsome fox demon who called himself Lord Qing suddenly asked, “Are you really that renowned Daoist from the Shidaofang in Central Lands, you foreign woman?”

The middle-aged female Daoist seemed intrigued by the question. One hand caressed the hilt of her sword while the other lightly flicked the fish-tail crown atop her head. “What? Is someone impersonating us in the Baoping Continent? If so, tell me their name, and I’ll consider it a merit on your part. I might even grant you a quicker death.”

The black-clad youth, who had stirred up a storm in the Lion’s Garden, clicked his tongue. “So you really are from the Shidaofang. But I wonder, after I devour your precious golden core, will it choke me to death?”

The Daoist’s lips curled into a smirk. “No wonder this is the smallest continent within the Haoran world. Whether on the mountain or below, those who dabble in Qi cultivation seem to have little skill but loud mouths. By the way, I’m Liu Boqi. I initially came here because of the Liu family’s surname in the Lion’s Garden. Yet, I’ve had such bad luck until now that I’ve finally turned it around. So, I owe you my thanks, and I want to give you a clear understanding before this true slug of a demon dies.”

The youth’s expression changed drastically. He couldn’t fathom how this annoying woman had seen through his true form.

What he didn’t realize was that the vermilion wine gourd at Chen Ping’an’s waist could obscure the prying eyes of a golden core earth immortal. After the Daoist displayed her divine powers, she immediately recognized it as a good-quality sword-nurturing gourd.

In an unremarkable tone, the middle-aged Daoist continued, “So, I say that the willow tree spirit is no different from a blind person. Even after coming and going to the Lion’s Garden so many times, you still can’t discern your own details. They simply took your fox scent and a few fox hair ropes and believed in your identity as a fox demon. It’s misleading. The ones supporting you behind the scenes to harm the Lion’s Garden are just as blind. Otherwise, they would’ve skinned you long ago. What’s the rise and fall of the Liu family’s literary fortune compared to the treasures you hold within?”

The boy, who once boasted of not fearing a Yuan Ying chasing him, now felt an unprecedented fear. He asked in a negotiating tone, “If I leave the Lion’s Garden now, will you spare me?”

The middle-aged Daoist answered without addressing his question, likely too disdainful to respond to such a foolish inquiry. She lightly tapped the hilt of her sword and said to herself, “This sword I carry, named Jiang Shen, ranks seventeenth in the Shidaofang of the Upside Down Mountain. As for my life’s weapon, it’s still a sword, named Jiazhu. But don’t worry, you won’t see my true weapon. That’s your great fortune.”

The youth’s knees buckled.

He pitifully said, “The fox demon I devoured wasn’t a good thing to begin with. It wanted to borrow a marriage to attain the golden core and even thought of leeching off the Liu family’s literary fortune, deluding itself into thinking it could participate in the imperial examination. Killing it and swallowing it whole is already a way to protect the Lion’s Garden from disaster. After that, an old immortal from the Qingluan Kingdom coveted the Liu family’s ancestral national seal. He teamed up with a powerful figure from the capital, and I simply took advantage of the situation, with each party getting what they needed. It’s a small deal and unworthy of mention. Please, as a generous lady, just let me go. If I’ve disturbed your enjoyment of the scenery, I’ll offer you the fox demon’s half-formed golden core as an apology. How does that sound?”

Daoist Liu Boqi laughed, “Do you think I won’t find your true form, so you’re just pretending to be crazy?”

The youth suddenly changed his demeanor, laughing heartily. “Oh, you old hag, your brain isn’t as waterlogged as I imagined. So what if you’re from the Shidaofang? So what if your sword Jiang Shen is some random weapon from the Upside Down Mountain? Don’t forget, this is Baoping Continent, the Qingluan Kingdom next to the Jiang family! Ugly hag, you won’t agree to a simple deal unless Lord Qing here berates you a few times? You really are a lowly servant. You should hurry to the capital to pray; otherwise, one day, if you fall into my hands here in Baoping, I’ll make sure to flay your skin off! You might even be happy about it, right?”

Liu Boqi surprisingly showed no anger, her smile playful. “As the saying goes, ‘A small temple has a big wind demon.’ You, this slug spirit, are quite amusing. It’s more entertaining than the demons I’ve faced before who would beg for mercy or scream madly at the moment of death.”

Though the handsome youth appeared arrogant and domineering, he was actually feeling uncertain. This woman was dragging her feet; it wasn’t her usual style. Was there a trap?

Yet no one knew that while acting as the land god, the willow spirit had played tricks; any significant movement in the Lion’s Garden would immediately alert him.

If there was a conspiracy brewing at the Xiulou, he could only endure for now and not rush to devour the hidden literary treasures. He would see who could outlast whom. This Daoist, Liu Boqi, and that young man with the sword on his back couldn’t possibly guard the Lion’s Garden forever.

What could be the unexpected support that gave this ugly Daoist such patience and composure? Why hadn’t she cut through his illusion like she did earlier at the courtyard wall?

Liu Boqi stood to the side of the bridge railing, gesturing for the demon to cross the arch bridge. She would not obstruct him. “If you reach the Xiulou, you’ll know the truth.”

Earlier, Liu Boqi had blocked his way. Now that she allowed him to pass, he began to feel that crossing the small arch bridge was like walking through a mountain of blades and a sea of fire.

The hearts of men and their schemes could be more terrifying than those of demons.

Over the long years, he had suffered numerous losses; otherwise, he might have already touched the threshold of the fifth realm.

This handsome youth, who had devoured a fox demon and was using its guise as a cover, was not just a rare slug. The reason Liu Boqi pursued him so relentlessly was due to special circumstances.

Because he was one of the rare “treasure-transforming demons” born from “the operation of heaven and earth, endless creations.” It was already incredibly difficult for slugs to become intelligent, and to transform into a treasure-transforming demon was even rarer. They delighted in devouring various spirits and ghosts. The most astonishing thing was not just their adeptness at disguise, concealment, and evasion but that they could consume numerous spirits and ghosts, absorbing their cultivation fortunes and advancing on multiple paths simultaneously. Using their original demon core as a staircase, they could step by step refine multiple golden cores.

He was like a treasure-whale on land, who could kill and reap profits!

Therefore, even with Liu Boqi’s high standards, she was determined to capture this ridiculous slug earth immortal. If that Chen dared to fight over it, her sword Jiang Shen and her life’s weapon Jiazhu would truly be blind to danger.

Seeing this guy cowering and glancing around, Liu Boqi smiled, “I know your true form is hidden somewhere deep underground, relying on the mountain’s energy vein to avoid my probing.”

The youth tilted his head. “If you’re so capable, why not just pull out your sword and slash away? That hiding spot by the mountain root and water veins wouldn’t withstand even half a stick of incense’s worth of your digging. Wouldn’t that leave me with nowhere to hide? Why not do that? Is there something you care about?”

He answered his own question. “Oh, I’ve guessed a possibility. After all, your every move in this period has caught my attention more than that young master who serves as a maid for the sword cultivators.”

Liu Boqi narrowed her eyes.

The youth raised his hands, grinning. “You wouldn’t let me say it out loud, would you? Come on, give me a clean cut, let’s settle this. We’ll see how the green mountains remain unchanged and the waters flow long!”

Liu Boqi did indeed slice through the illusion of the youth at the bridgehead.

Once again, a single fox hair fell to the ground.

Liu Boqi gazed into the distance, surrounded by green mountains.

She found the mountains enchanting, instantly captivated.

Liu Boqi felt a bit flushed, fortunate that there was no one around, and her skin was slightly dark, making her less conspicuous.

Reining in her thoughts, she returned to her cold demeanor. Feeling the subtle currents of energy swirling around, Liu Boqi waited to see the drama unfold. This slug filled with treasures was about to face a major setback.

Since it was a situation beneficial to both parties, Liu Boqi drew her renowned sword Jiang Shen from the Shidaofang. With swift movements, she began to cut through the connections between the mountain roots and water veins in various spots around the Lion’s Garden. She would stab at the most likely hiding places, deliberately creating some disturbances and stirring up the Feng Shui of the Lion’s Garden for the time being.

She continued to buy time for that young man in white with the sword-nurturing gourd at his waist.

Dealing with a cunning slug demon like this, difficult to catch but easy to kill, Liu Boqi could only hold her nose and engage in such a tedious task.

————

Outside a tightly shut study, the handsome youth’s illusion reappeared. With hands behind his back, he kicked open the door and crossed the threshold.

After sniffing the air and feeling slightly uncomfortable, he rolled his eyes and muttered, “I really don’t know what virtue the Liu family ancestors accumulated to have such a rich literary aura lingering in the Lion’s Garden. No wonder that fox demon from Longmen was so envious. What a pity, though—bad luck, all for nothing.”

He began to knock around, checking for any secret compartments or mechanisms, and after finding none, he started rummaging through easily concealable places.

That treasure had to be in this study.

In this Lion’s Garden calamity, he had dealt with the two major players behind the scenes and knew they were tough opponents—one had high cultivation, and the other held great power. Even he was reluctant to delve too deep into their dealings.

That old perv, who loved collecting seals and treasures from various countries in the Baoping Continent, had a hooked nose, and his smile was more sinister than that of a ghostly figure. According to some sayings derived from the Yin-Yang scholars, his facial features were quite fitting: “Nose like an eagle’s beak, pecking at the heart and marrow,” utterly incisive.

The old creep walked the path of a hidden dragon in the court, always keen on scavenging relics of fallen kingdoms. The closer the relics were to the last emperor, the more he cherished them and the higher his bids.

It was said that this person had collected nearly a hundred emperor seals from various dynasties, but he had two major regrets: one was a complete set of jade seals, of which he was missing a piece. There were rumors that it had appeared around Fengwei Crossing, but the old man seemed wary of that alleyway, which had produced several fifth-realm cultivators, and hadn’t dared to take the risk of robbing it.

The second regret was his fervent desire for the “Treasure of Universal Inspection,” which had been passed down through generations in the Lion’s Garden. This treasure was a relic from a great dynasty that had perished in the south of the Baoping Continent. Although it was not large, only two inches square, made of gold, it bore the inscription: “Scope over the world, silently praising the divine. Golden armor shining, autumn hunting in all directions.”

He occasionally glanced up at the window.

That old hag really wouldn’t give up and began using the most straightforward methods to find her true form. Ha! If she can find it, she can consider herself capable!

He reveled in his self-satisfaction, attributing this to a book about wandering knights he had read, which mentioned that the most dangerous place is often the safest. The more he pondered over that saying, the more profound it seemed.

He continued searching for that small gold ingot, feeling a bit vexed.

That Liu little cripple was quite adept at hiding things.

Though even if he found it, he couldn’t take it away for now, it was still good to satiate his eyes.

It was quite absurd; after getting involved with the Feng Shui of the Lion’s Garden, he had become the pitiful fellow who couldn’t even lift that small ingot.

If he didn’t consider the consequences, it wouldn’t be a problem. But he was unwilling; on the path of a demon’s cultivation, the most abundant resource was time.

This was perhaps the heavens’ way of compensating demons, making their cultivation journey even more arduous. Becoming intelligent was one hurdle, transforming into human form was another, and finally seeking a secret tome that pointed directly to the Dao or having extraordinary luck to directly be “sealed” was the third hurdle. According to historical records, there had been an incredibly fortunate fifth-realm fox demon at the Longhu Mountain Taishi Mansion, who, just by having the Taishi seal lightly pressed upon its fur, was able to block all the thunder tribulations that a Yuan Ying should face, skipping over that nearly insurmountable chasm. Which demon wouldn’t envy this in the Haoran world?

He had only heard rumors and was about to envy it to death.

Out of the corner of his eye, he inadvertently caught sight of the couplets hanging high on the walls of the study, written by the little cripple Liu Qingshan himself. As for whether the content was copied from sage texts or was originally thought up by him, he had only read a few books and didn’t know the answer.

One side read, “Pen under a thousand-army formation, poetry and prose like ten thousand horses.”

The other side read, “Uphold virtue to match the past and present, hiding books to teach descendants.”

One was outwardly imposing, while the other was inwardly restrained.

Even this little meaning, he could still discern.

He raised his head, spat on the couplets on either side of the wall.

Then he burst out laughing.

Seeing a well-read, spirited scholar now wallowing in the mud, worse off than a drenched chicken or a waterlogged dog—what a delightful sight!

He swaggered past the desk filled with literary offerings and sat down in a chair, leaning back and twisting his hips, feeling it wasn't comfortable enough. He began to curse, “Damn, those scholars are such gluttons for punishment, they can’t even be bothered to make a decent chair. They insist on making people sit straight and suffer.”

He stared blankly up.

He thought of another behind-the-scenes bigwig, an elder from the Tang family wielding power in the Qingluan Kingdom.

This man had looked down on Liu Jingtian for a long time.

It was quite peculiar; even he, an outsider, knew that Liu Jingtian, the virtuous official, was a crucial pillar supporting the court. How could a current emperor’s uncle regard Liu Jingtian as a foe?

In the past two years, how many scholars from the south had come for the sake of Liu the Elder’s good reputation?

He couldn’t wrap his mind around it.

But he recalled the father-son drinking party he had eavesdropped on while lying on a beam in the Lion’s Garden last year.

Liu Jingtian and his two sons were drinking and chatting, mostly about Liu Jingtian’s concerns for the country, the eldest son’s latest news, and Liu Qingshan’s critiques of current events.

The scholars and officials who harbored the most resentment toward Liu Jingtian were quite amusing. They were not merely early political enemies with differing views but those who had attempted to affiliate themselves with Liu the Elder and failed, desperately trying to flatter him without success. A group of others were those who, despite constantly clashing with Liu the Elder’s students and disciples, ended up red-faced from the arguments, only to be left with deep-seated hatred for Liu Jingtian as well.

Liu Jingtian might find it puzzling himself; he typically did not distinguish people based on their official rank or family background. At most, he would refrain from commenting on excessive flattery and ignore any deliberate attempts to curry favor. Yet it was precisely Liu Jingtian’s attitude that struck at the core of some people’s grievances. After resigning and retreating, during a casual chat about official matters with his eldest son, that county magistrate, who was far less impressive than his brother Liu Qingshan, thoroughly explained these principles to his father. At the time, Liu Jingtian could only drink away his cup of wine.

Liu Qingshan, however, was unconvinced and spoke bluntly, turning to criticize his older brother.

Fortunately, that older brother understood Liu Qingshan’s temperament and wasn’t angry, merely saying that he had entered the bureaucratic quagmire and hoped Liu Qingshan wouldn’t follow suit.

What a beautiful scene of filial piety and brotherly harmony.

At that moment, he couldn’t help but wonder if the fox demon he had devoured had genuinely wished to integrate into the Liu family of the Lion’s Garden. Perhaps it had wanted to participate in the imperial examination with the hope of one day, as Liu Jingtian’s son-in-law, achieving something in both the court and literature, ultimately giving back to the Liu family’s literary fortune?

But he had been too greedy at that time and had swallowed the not-yet-golden core fox demon whole, and he recalled having burped a few times in satisfaction.

He turned his head, feeling that the Daoist woman was inevitably wasting her efforts trying to find his true form, and viciously muttered, “Looking that ugly, it’s only fitting for you to pair up with a lame man!”

It was a pity he wasn’t a Confucian sage with the Heavenly Mandate.

With a sigh, he withdrew his gaze and aimlessly glanced over the various worthless writing implements scattered about.

Suddenly, his eyes widened, and he reached out to touch a small box next to a long wooden paperweight.

Hot to the touch!

He quickly withdrew his hand, feeling pleased, and laughed while cursing, “Good job, Liu Qingshan, you little thief!”

————

On the other side of the Liu family ancestral hall.

Two instructors from the family school remained nearby Liu Jingtian.

Liu Jingtian smiled wryly, “I’ve troubled Master Fu.”

The elder merely shook his head.

Aside from teaching, this old scholar hardly spoke and showed little change in expression.

The people of the Lion’s Garden were somewhat afraid of this old scholar.

The middle-aged Confucian, Master Liu, though not exactly approachable and more strict, was still more relatable than the elder with the surname Fu. Almost all Liu descendants and servants who had attended school under him had felt his discipline and lessons.

At this time, the middle-aged Confucian had quietly moved to the entrance of the ancestral hall, waiting for Liu Qingshan’s return.

Upon seeing Liu Qingshan return safely from the Xiulou, Master Liu remained expressionless until the limping Liu Qingshan greeted him with a student’s bow, at which point he nodded in acknowledgment.

Liu Qingshan crossed the threshold to join his father Liu Jingtian.

The middle-aged Confucian stood at the door, then his gaze moved upwards, spotting two figures from the Book Collection Pavilion—a master and servant pair from the central region of the Baoping Continent.

Whether it was a lack of vision or willful ignorance, the middle-aged Confucian soon turned around and returned to the ancestral hall.

Under the eaves of the Book Collection Pavilion, the maid Meng Long asked with a smile, “Young Master, do you think that Fu Sheng and this Liu fellow are like us, perhaps seclusive experts?”

The Dugu young master chuckled, “First, explain to me when we became seclusive experts?”

Meng Long smiled knowingly, leaning on the railing and gazing into the distance.

In the Baoping Continent, weren’t they considered such?

The young master was just being humble.

In her kingdom, the Zhu Ying Dynasty, sword cultivators were abundant, more than any other continent. The kingdom was prosperous, with over a dozen vassal states.

Among the dragon descendants who had long decided to abandon the throne, one tenth-realm sword cultivator had sparred three times with the once-renowned first Yuan Ying of the Baoping Continent, Li Tuanjing. Though he had lost every time, no one dared to question this sword cultivator's strength. How many earth immortals in the Baoping Continent would dare to test Li Tuanjing’s sword?

Li Tuanjing had single-handedly held down Zhengyang Mountain for hundreds of years. Therefore, this sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty, after losing, was able to convince Li Tuanjing to fight him two more times—his swordsmanship was evident.

There were also two ninth-realm sword cultivators, a pair of celestial lovers who disregarded their blood ties, and thus, publicly severed ties with the Zhu Ying Dynasty. At least on the surface, they rarely appeared and dedicated themselves to the sword path. Rumor had it that the old emperor’s treasury was actually managed by these two, closely tied to several major families in the southern region, with a steady flow of wealth.

Meng Long said indignantly, “Young Master, the cultivators from North Julu Continent are truly too overbearing, especially that damn Daoist Tianjun!”

The Dugu young master smiled, “In the eyes of the mountain demons we wiped out, are we not the same? Are those servant girls who died under your night-walking deity’s feet deserving of death? Naturally not; we just can’t be bothered to fuss over it.”

Meng Long was momentarily speechless.

She could only kick the high railing with her toes in frustration.

————

Chen Ping’an brought Shi Rou, heading straight for the main gate of the Lion’s Garden instead of drawing charms near the Xiulou.

The two painted door gods had become so weak in spirit that they could no longer protect the Liu family.

Chen Ping’an muttered some apologetic words before starting to draw a talisman of the pagoda to suppress demons on the two large doors.

Unlike the “small skirmishes” at the Xiulou, the two talismans at the main gate each required a vigorous effort, bold and expansive, the divine energy flowing like ink.

Standing behind Chen Ping’an, Shi Rou secretly nodded. If not for the ordinary material of the brush and the mediocre quality of the gold paint in the ceramic pot, Chen Ping’an’s talismans would have been even more powerful.

After finishing, Chen Ping’an took a few steps back, standing alongside Shi Rou, confirming that there were no flaws before continuing to draw charms along the stone-paved path outside the Lion’s Garden, spacing out by more than fifty steps before continuing to draw.

As they walked, Chen Ping’an said to the silent Shi Rou, “While I’m drawing charms, I must focus entirely. I may not notice that demon’s traces immediately, so keep a lookout.”

Shi Rou replied calmly, “Setting aside my duty to relieve my master’s worries, this also concerns my own life, so of course, I wouldn’t dare to be careless. You worry too much, Master.”

Chen Ping’an turned to glance at her. “Is it true that a person who has been poor for so long suddenly comes into wealth becomes stingy?”

Shi Rou detected the subtle sarcasm in his tone and had no intention of countering.

It wasn’t because she felt guilty or ashamed, but due to the note she had received.

After unrolling the paper horse left by Cui Dongshan for Zhu Lian, the note was brief and to the point, just six words.

“Sister, don’t seek death.”

It seemed like a jest, yet it sent a chill down the spine of even Shi Rou’s immortal remnant.

Chen Ping’an rapidly drew charms, clearly having put in significant effort; otherwise, he wouldn’t have learned from a master.

Shi Rou couldn’t deny that Chen Ping’an’s resilience, whether in his focus or physical strength, played a substantial role, both of which were indispensable.

Drawing charms was mentally exhausting.

A well-known saying among the talisman sects.

After a moment, while Shi Rou leaned against the wall, catching her breath, she quietly asked, “Is Master setting up a formation?”

Chen Ping’an shot her a glare, quickly raising a finger to his lips, signaling her to keep quiet. As he moved forward, he was getting increasingly irritated and shot another glare at Shi Rou for her lack of discretion.

Holding a ceramic pot filled with thick gold paint, Shi Rou obediently followed behind Chen Ping’an. She couldn’t help but smile slightly at the thought that even this guy could get flustered at times, though she quickly suppressed it.

The Lion’s Garden was quite expansive, which made it difficult for Chen Ping’an to attempt to draw charms and set up a formation quietly. In order to finish before the great demon noticed him, he was truly putting all his effort into sketching on the white walls.

This was no easier than engaging in a direct fight.

Unlike the four companions who had experienced one storm after another, Shi Rou hadn’t gone through a series of trials nor traveled across two continents, so she was far less familiar with Chen Ping’an’s true capabilities and nature. Regarding his background, Shi Rou was well aware of his substantial resources: a soaring realm immortal’s external incarnation and a student disciple Cui Dongshan. The combination of these two alone was already quite formidable.

However, Chen Ping’an now sought to close the gates and catch the dog by the tail, linking this with the previous arrangements at the Liu family’s Xiulou and ancestral hall.

Shi Rou genuinely admired Chen Ping’an’s style.

He left no room for error.

If a gentleman doesn’t stand under a dangerous wall, then Chen Ping’an was the kind who, once he made up his mind to walk toward the dangerous wall, would prepare everything possible for himself, from holding an umbrella to wearing a hat and putting on armor.

Of course, Chen Ping’an had no intention of speculating about Shi Rou’s thoughts.

Whatever the issue, it was up to Shi Rou to handle it with Cui Dongshan.

Once Chen Ping’an completed his final talisman after circling the Lion’s Garden, he still felt it wasn’t enough. He went around again, pouring true energy into many charms he had drawn earlier but hadn’t used, sticking them on various parts of the walls.

It was a reckless investment.

Chen Ping’an leapt onto the wall, thinking he definitely needed to find an excuse to tug at Pei Qian’s ear later.

After all, she was his first disciple; he couldn’t just let her off without some reasoning!

Chen Ping’an stretched lazily and smiled as he surveyed his surroundings.

Spring was nearing its end, and the green mountains were turning vibrant.

Standing beside Chen Ping’an, Shi Rou still held two ceramic pots.

Noticing the unusual expression on Chen Ping’an’s face, Shi Rou felt a bit puzzled.

Chen Ping’an wrapped his hands behind his shoulders, fingers interlaced, palms resting against the hilt of the “Sword Immortal” on his back.

With a sword immortal on his back, when would he truly become a sword immortal?

He remembered once looking down at a certain region of the Baoping Continent from a ferry, where someone smiled brightly and pointed at the land, saying that the two kingdoms they fought over beneath their feet were nothing much. Further south from the ferry, there was the Zhu Ying Dynasty, where sword cultivators were the most numerous in the Baoping Continent—just a drizzle compared to her homeland. She had even told Chen Ping’an that if he ever had the chance, he should first visit the Zhu Ying Dynasty before heading to North Julu Continent. He would then understand that was where the true sword cultivators thrived, surpassing all others—nothing in the world could compare.

Chen Ping’an was somewhat yearning for that North Julu Continent.

Gradually putting aside these thoughts, Chen Ping’an took out his sword-nurturing gourd, only to find it empty.

A bit awkward.

He silently put it away, hoping Shi Rou hadn’t noticed.

Shi Rou found it amusing and inappropriately asked, “Shall I fetch a pot of wine for the master?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head and stomped his foot.

Suddenly, one by one, the talismans on the outer wall of the Lion’s Garden glimmered, radiating light.

As if commanded by an edict, they all simultaneously burst forth with brilliant golden light.

In an instant, it was as if a golden jiao dragon coiled around the Lion’s Garden.

(End of Chapter)### Chapter 395: The Truth Revealed Amidst a Pile of Small Coins

When the unusual phenomena appeared on the outer walls of the Lion Garden, 

Liu Boqi was the first to soar to the top of a pavilion, nodding slightly, a rare expression of admiration on his face.

During his training at the Upside-down Mountain’s Sword House, he encountered more strange and extraordinary events than anyone could find in any continent of the vast world. Liu Boqi was a favored child of destiny, entrusted with high hopes by the great deity of Upside-down Mountain. Frequently accompanying senior disciples on journeys to capture the weary old flood dragons that returned from the rain, his standards were naturally set high.

Standing by the railing known as the Beauty’s Rest, Zhu Lian was joined by Pei Qian, who perched on the railing. Curiously, she asked, “Is it my master?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “Young Master can use talismans. I witnessed it firsthand during the battle at the Daqing (Great Qing) border mountains. Three Iron Cavalry Surrounding City talismans formed a powerful trio of talismans, effectively trapping that great river demon. I never expected that you could draw talismans yourself; your skill is impressive, and your spirit is formidable…”

Pei Qian retorted with annoyance, “What can’t my master do? Why is that surprising?”

Zhu Lian teased, “Oh? Then why were your eyes bulging like a dustpan just now, secretly grinning like a big mouth?”

Pei Qian straightened her face, unwilling to engage in idle chatter with the old cook. She raised her head, glancing at the eaves above and then at the ground outside the railing. Taking a deep breath, she leaped powerfully, attempting to flip onto the roof. However, she ended up pulling some tiles down with her as she fell. Just as Zhu Lian reached out to catch the reckless girl by the scruff of her neck, he suddenly changed his mind and let Pei Qian drop into the courtyard. During her fall, her mind went blank, but instinctively, the fiery dragon energy within her surged and coiled into a form resembling a monkey, similar to the stance Zhu Lian took when he raised his fists. At about ten feet above the ground, her limbs suddenly stretched out, landing gracefully like a small wild cat.

Zhu Lian, leaning over the railing, exclaimed, “This young heroine can even run on rooftops and has remarkable lightness skills!”

Pei Qian sat down on the ground, her face pale from fright. Coming back to her senses, she yelled at Zhu Lian, who was watching with ease, “Old cook, why didn’t you save me?! If I fell to the brink of death, missing an arm or a leg, what would my master think? I’m already a burden; I walk slowly and would only slow down my master. What if my master gets unhappy and decides to abandon me...”

Imagining that tragic scenario, Pei Qian began to wail.

Her cries were so loud that Zhu Lian couldn’t stand it, and even the maid Zhao Ya rushed outside, puzzled to see Pei Qian sitting in the courtyard after having just been whispering with her.

Feigning panic, Zhu Lian exclaimed, “Quick! Upstairs, there’s a monster!”

Without a second thought, Pei Qian sprang up, ceasing her cries, and dashed up the steps of the embroidered building, bursting into the unlocked room, turning around to shut the door tightly. She grabbed her walking stick and dashed to Zhu Lian’s side, looking around with tears still in her eyes, as she patted the yellow paper talisman on her forehead, asking, “Where is it? Where is it?”

Zhu Lian stifled his laughter and casually said, “Well, it seems you got lucky. That monster seems to have given up after failing to break into the embroidered building and left.”

Pei Qian wiped her tears and sweat away fiercely, still terrified. From start to finish, she had hardly noticed Zhu Lian’s teasing expression; she widened her eyes determinedly, looking for any traces of the monster. With all seriousness, she said, “Zhu Lian, if that monster comes back to the embroidered building next time, you must protect Miss Liu and Sister Ya! Otherwise, when my master returns and sees they’ve been captured by the monster, even if my master doesn’t scold me aloud, I’m sure she’ll be furious in her heart.”

Zhao Ya turned around, stifling a laugh.

Zhu Lian grinned, “Aren’t you worried about your own safety?”

Pei Qian pulled out another talisman, sticking it to her forehead and gripping her walking stick tightly, declaring, “My master told me to protect myself, so I must do it!”

Zhu Lian stood with one fist behind his back and the other hand resting on his abdomen, exuding a master’s demeanor as he smiled, “Don’t worry, your master also said to take good care of you.”

——

On the top of the library,

the Lonely Young Master smiled, “That sneaky monster is probably going to be beaten back now.”

Meng Long asked, “Can it truly trap the entire Lion Garden?”

The Lonely Young Master explained, “It may not withstand the monster’s repeated charges, but as long as it reveals its true form, that’s when the female crown will strike and slay it.”

Meng Long inquired, “But what if the monster decides to hide and not show itself?”

Pointing to the unusual aura at the edges of the Lion Garden, the Lonely Young Master replied, “Common folks within the Lion Garden may not notice anything, but to those in the know, that golden light flowing like a stream around the mountains is not just a barrier; it’s also connected to the land’s roots and water veins. Since the land is now free, locating the monster's hiding place will be much easier. Besides, since this young immortal can draw such a vast talisman formation, he can keep drawing more circles and marking key locations that gather wind and water. Even if the monster doesn’t die immediately, it’ll be thoroughly tormented, like being placed in boiling water—very unpleasant.”

Meng Long was unconvinced, “He’s drawn so many talismans just to create this commotion; that’s not impressive at all. Your master can create a vortex of purple smoke with a single talisman and can easily bind a city of hundreds of thousands with it, or directly crush a major demon with his bare hands…”

The Lonely Young Master sighed, “I’m praising that young man, and you’re talking about how great my master is—these are two different matters. You shouldn’t always look down on Qi cultivators and pure martial artists outside of your circle.”

Meng Long bluntly said, “I just can’t stand it when others compare to the Young Master. If that young man named Chen were a woman, even if she were a sword fairy, would you be jealous when you see her?”

The Lonely Young Master laughed and asked, “What if she were a young female sword fairy who was also prettier than you?”

Meng Long leaned on the railing, saying, “Then I would be so jealous I’d want to kill someone.”

The Lonely Young Master smiled, “Small-minded and petty. You should be wary of that.”

Meng Long gazed into the distance, softly stating, “As sword cultivators, we walk the most perilous paths; as long as we can wield our swords, that suffices.”

The Lonely Young Master shook his head, “That’s because you haven’t reached a higher level yet. But it’s okay; you have great talent, so just take your time climbing the sword path. Even my parents value you, considering you an excellent innate sword talent. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have gifted you that night-traveling god.”

Meng Long suddenly felt that her Young Master seemed to have some thoughts he was holding back, so she turned her head and pressed her cheek against the railing.

After a moment of silence, the Lonely Young Master smiled and said, “Are you my gut feeling? Fine, I’ll share an interesting story with you. My parents once accompanied someone to Fenglei Garden to visit Li Tuanjing and had the chance to witness the third round of battles between Yuan Ying sword cultivators. Naturally, we lost. But afterward, Li Tuanjing served tea and said something quite strange. This top Yuan Ying cultivator from Baipingzhou joked that Qi cultivators have no right to look down on the world, but are merely lucky to have taken an easier path. In the early days, the rules weren’t about ‘cultivating Qi’ but who had the best farming skills. The one who could grow crops best was the most ‘in harmony with the Dao,’ or the one who could make shoes best was ‘blessed by heaven.’ Just look at those lofty immortals now; what scene do you think they’d be in?”

Meng Long quietly remarked, “Li Tuanjing from Fenglei Garden is indeed a person who enjoys saying strange things and doing odd deeds.”

The Lonely Young Master nodded, “Li Tuanjing is a true immortal of our time. However, even after his death, Fenglei Garden, despite having the Yellow River and Liu Ba Bridge, can’t suppress the rising sword energy from Zhengyang Mountain.”

Meng Long suddenly recalled something, “What about Liu Ba Bridge and Su Jia? Did they end up like the stories where the lovers finally unite?”

The Lonely Young Master contemplated, “Even if their love story is like a perfect tale, we’re probably only halfway through it.”

Meng Long lowered her voice and whispered, “Young Master, is there really a novelist gathering at that white paper blessed land? What is written in the book will come true for those beings in that land? Our matron also said that among the various sages, this one is quite remarkable, with high cultivation; they can write about the affairs of a nation, while those with lesser cultivation can write about a state or region, and the lowest-tier novelist’s disciples, just starting out, can only write about a single person’s life, aging, illness, and death. In the end, the more characters they write, the bigger that blessed land's territory becomes.”

The Lonely Young Master chuckled, “In this vast world, there’s no end to the strange and the true. Who knows what’s real and what’s not?”

Meng Long asked, “Young Master, when we both become earth immortals someday, shall we go and find out?”

The Lonely Young Master crossed his arms behind his head, squinting and smiling, “Sounds good.”

——

In the study of Liu Qingshan, the black-robed youth looked anxious.

That damned young man with the sword—how could he be proficient in talisman techniques and carry so many impressive talismans on him?!

Was he determined to fight it out to the bitter end? Didn’t he fear that they might end up with both sides suffering? What on earth did this Chen want? The precious item on the table, the hunting treasure, was only useful for that old pervert Fu Long! If he dropped so many talismans, did he really think he was Liu from the prosperous Aiyai Continent?

He was like an ant on a hot pan, pacing around the study.

Madmen, all of them!

It was one thing for that ghostly woman from the Sword House to be involved, but now there was a selfless gentleman emerging, two unrelated characters actually teaming up to set a trap for him—one drawing talismans outside, the other distracting him inside the garden.

Could it be that his plan to seize the Lion Garden would fail this time? Just thinking of that eagle-hooked-nose pervert and that powerful old man from the Tang clan made him feel uneasy.

He almost thought of revealing his true form, regardless of crashing through the walls, as long as he could escape the Lion Garden. Once outside, even with his exceptional earth-escaping technique, surrounded by mountains, he wouldn’t fear anyone unless a Yuan Ying earth immortal came personally to hunt him down with earth-shattering power capable of slicing through the surrounding mountains. 

But he quickly reminded himself to remain calm. The Lion Garden had indeed become a cage for the time being; that was a given. He couldn’t rush—absolutely not!

A smile crept across his face as he devised a plan, “Then let the old man test the strength of these people first.”

On the outer walls of the Lion Garden, Chen Ping’an was hesitating whether to let Shi Rou ask the Liu clan for silver ingots from the royal family of Qingluan Country. He could also draw talismans; however, the silver material was far inferior to the gold ingots used for talismans. Although there were pros and cons—bad effects included decreased efficacy of the talismans, while the advantage was that it was easier for Chen Ping’an to draw the talismans without much effort. To be honest, this deal, aside from emptying his long-accumulated yellow paper talismans, had also nearly squandered most of the spiritual energy he hadn’t refined from the gold elixirs.

But these ins and outs were not something outsiders needed to know.

He decided to think positively.

For instance, if he could actually fill the Lion Garden with talismans, it would be worth having a good chat with Zhang Shanfeng and Xu Yuanxia afterward… over drinks.

Just as Chen Ping’an made up his mind and squinted to look,

he saw nearly a hundred black-robed youths appearing in the vast Lion Garden, some sprinting down corridors and paths, while others leaped onto rooftops, skimming the surface.

They all fled toward the outside of the Lion Garden.

It was highly likely that one of those handsome youths was the true form of that monster.

Once it escaped the Lion Garden, Chen Ping’an would truly have no way to deal with it next time it returned.

Chen Ping’an knew the weight of the talismans he drew; they could barely be considered powerful but were not enduring enough—the spiritual energy dissipated too quickly. This was the most fatal flaw of martial artists drawing talismans.

Chen Ping’an decisively said, “I’ll stay here; you guard the right wall. The fox demon’s illusion isn’t hard to break. If you find its true form, just stall for a moment. The binding monster rope I lent you…”

Shi Rou thought Chen Ping’an wanted to reclaim the treasure for himself, so she calmly handed over the golden rope. Chen Ping’an chuckled, “No, I need you to use it well; quickly go guard over there!”

Shi Rou was slightly surprised, taking off with the high-quality binding monster rope in hand.

Chen Ping’an gently patted the sword-raising gourd, silently thinking, “Don’t rush out yet; you are my trump cards. Wait until I confirm the monster’s true form is breaking through in this direction before you come out.”

Over at the library, Meng Long was eager to try, her eyes blazing, “No matter if it’s an illusion or not, Young Master, let me take action? Staying in the Lion Garden is killing me!”

The Lonely Young Master reminded her, “Right now, many people from Qingluan Country are watching the Lion Garden, so you must not use your life sword; possessing a treasure brings trouble. I don’t want to stir up a heap of trouble. Also, don’t damage too many buildings in the Lion Garden.”

The maid felt somewhat disappointed, but it was still better than standing still like a wooden person. She tapped her toes, floated to the railing, and muttered incantations, one hand making gestures while the other reached forward. Her bright eyes sparkled with golden light, and finally, she shouted, “Come out!”

A towering figure in golden armor, three stories tall, landed with a thud, raising a cloud of dust.

This deity, besides being immense, had five ribbons of gathered spiritual energy swirling around its large body, wearing a crown, with one arm covered in gold armor that oozed miasma while the other was etched with various ghastly faces.

Yet the god remained with its eyes closed.

It seemed to have received Meng Long’s command.

As this rare night-traveling god moved forward, though its eyes were tightly shut, it still skillfully avoided all the buildings in the Lion Garden, causing the ground to quake with each step.

With one kick, it crushed a black-robed youth who couldn’t evade in time.

The five ribbons, refined by immortals, darted like five dragonlets leaving the dragon pond: not more than two yards long but moving swiftly, easily piercing through the bodies of those handsome youths.

The night-traveling god swept an arm, smashing a phantom of a monster that had been flying over the rooftops.

Meng Long changed her position, sitting on the railing, disdainfully saying, “Is this really so weak?”

The Lonely Young Master explained, “That monster has already scattered a bit of its divine light; being able to maintain that agile form is quite impressive.”

Having witnessed the night-traveling deity crushing a fox demon before, the disparity was enormous, and danger seemed minimal. Thus, the other disciples and the couple of cultivators at different parts of the Lion Garden had only just begun to exhibit their skills, slaying demons and eliminating threats.

An old man’s little red fox leaped into the air, its body shuddering, suddenly expanding in size until it landed on a rooftop, becoming a massive fire fox, flames dancing around its form.

Meanwhile, a tall young man swung his arm, and the green snake coiling around his arm lunged forward, transforming into a two-yard-long giant serpent.

Each pair hunted down the black-robed youths frantically fleeing toward the Lion Garden’s exit.

The couple of cultivators chose a spot near a garden, with one drawing their long sword from behind as if controlling it to slay enemies, while the other used hand gestures, stepping through formations, unleashing a dense wave of spiritual energy into the garden like a fog enveloping the plants. In an instant, various arm-sized spectral figures surged from the garden, chasing after the black-robed youths before exploding upon impact.

Chen Ping’an, Shi Rou, and the library all stood firm in the west of the Lion Garden.

Chen Ping’an threw punches from the top of the wall, while Shi Rou used the golden dragon beard binding monster rope to withstand the onslaught.

However, the illusions of the monster were too numerous, and nearly forty black-robed youths continued crashing against the wall adorned with the golden talisman dragon.

The Lonely Young Master didn’t allow Meng Long to use her life sword; he remained a passive observer.

Thus, many managed to escape, but even so, the night-traveling god was incredibly intimidating. Many of the monsters that were originally rushing toward the library’s high wall suddenly changed their escape routes.

Ironically, the library was the least impacted area.

Although the west had “numerous people,” with four cultivators stationed, it was the most dangerous spot, taking the brunt of the hits.

Meanwhile, Shi Rou was somewhat flustered. After all, she wasn’t the type of ghost adept at fighting. She couldn’t dare use the secret weapon gifted by Cui Dongshan, so nearly ten black-robed youths crashed against the wall, only to be dissolved by the golden light river on the outer wall. Some lucky phantoms that managed to escape continued to charge forward, disregarding death.

Fortunately, Shi Rou handled herself well without any major blunders.

Chen Ping’an’s punches, though seemingly slow, were the most effortless in blocking.

Using the six-step stance, he rotated back and forth atop the wall, his sleeves flipping, his punches full of vigor.

Yet, that golden dragon, which flowed along the white wall, was starting to dim, and the surrounding walls had been punched into countless small “doors.”

As if after drawing talismans, Chen Ping’an was once again dealing with the bewildering black-robed youths. He was running low on pure true energy and needed to pause to catch his breath.

At that moment,

the Liu family ancestral hall trembled as if an Ao fish had turned over, shaking the ground with a thunderous roar.

The commotion was most intense on the western side.

Meng Long suddenly stood up, making hand gestures, closing her eyes, and using a secret technique to project her spirit. She attached herself to the night-traveling deity, which opened its eyes slightly, bending its knees, lifting off the ground, leaving a large hole beneath it. The three-story tall night-traveling god flew westward.

The deity’s feet sank into the garden’s high wall, and it crouched down, hefting an arm, and smashed its fists into the ground, sending mud flying.

It forcibly broke a small mountain root beneath the Lion Garden.

The Lonely Young Master hesitated but still refrained from intervening.

Just then, a strikingly handsome youth, five or six stories tall, burst forth from the earth, practically colliding with the monsters soaring toward the library’s wall.

That golden dragon winding around the wall acted like a tripwire for the black-robed youth, who roared as his true form emerged, continuing to charge forward, causing talismans and golden light from other areas to be pulled in his direction.

He crashed through the wall, but a golden talisman rope remained stubbornly attached to his knee.

Raising his leg high, he still couldn’t shake off the hindrance of the rope, so he simply pressed forward.

The golden dragon, which had originally been a seamless loop, snapped, being dragged along by the black-robed demon that revealed its golden body, creating a trail of destruction.

It was like a large fish that hadn’t yet been caught but was putting up such a fight that it was dragging the fishing line and rod along with it.

Chen Ping’an pressed his hand against the mouth of the sword-raising gourd, thinking, “Something’s off; I better wait longer.”

A slender figure standing atop the pavilion suddenly moved like a white rainbow, and the pavilion collapsed with a crash as Liu Boqi struck down.

Finally making her move, Liu Boqi was taller than the library, and with a single slice, she cleaved the golden body in half.

Without even glancing at the true nature of the severed golden form, she coldly laughed, “Go!”

From her back emerged a figure holding a sword, with a stature like that of a regular person, but with a body resembling mercury. He wielded a black, slender sword that was even longer than himself.

In the blink of an eye, he stood firm, thrusting the sword’s tip into a small hole in the wall.

Shi Rou swallowed nervously, looking down.

At the tip of the sword, he had stabbed a small, entirely white, palm-sized wriggling monster.

Liu Boqi swiftly approached the high wall near Shi Rou, drawing closer to the sword-wielding deity. They merged into one, appearing as Liu Boqi alone.

Yet that extremely long sword remained suspended in mid-air, and Liu Boqi walked over to the tip, smiling, “Got you.”

She didn’t immediately capture this transformed treasure demon, turning to the young man in white, whose palm had just left the sword-raising gourd, asking, “What do you think? With so many of you here, shall we have a little contest?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Let’s not be greedy after having gained something.”

Liu Boqi replied, “I’m well aware that catching this little guy took a good deal of effort from you, and I won’t deny that. Yet I’m not used to sharing spoils, so if you feel uncomfortable, why don’t we have a little spar to decide the ownership of this little creature? I can promise not to kill, and after the match, you’ll surely feel satisfied, and perhaps even be grateful to be alive—that would be a good outcome.”

Chen Ping’an walked along the wall toward the Sword House's female crown.

At the embroidered building, Zhu Lian leaped out to stand on a nearby rooftop, looking identical to the female crown they had first encountered in their little courtyard.

Shi Rou took a few steps out, hovering in mid-air, allowing Chen Ping’an to pass first before trailing behind him.

Chen Ping’an waved at Zhu Lian.

Liu Boqi also arrived at the wall, approaching Chen Ping’an.

She left her life weapon, the armored sword, behind, instead wielding her drawn blade, the fierce god.

Her gaze was strange as she asked, “Is it just you?”

Chen Ping’an wrapped his hand around behind him and moved forward, already grasping the hilt of the “Sword Fairy’s” sword.

A female crown from the Sword House.

A pure martial artist with a half-immortal weapon on his back.

The distance between them was no more than fifty paces.

Liu Boqi suddenly turned her gaze toward a peak in the distance.

At almost the same moment, Chen Ping’an turned to see an old man’s figure vanishing from view.

Liu Boqi withdrew her gaze, noticing from the corner of her eye that the Liu clan members were approaching rapidly, among them a poor scholar limping along.

Liu Boqi sheathed her sword, saying, “For the treasure demon, I’ll take seven, you take three.”

Seeing Chen Ping’an’s confused expression,

she grew slightly irritated, “What? You don’t want it?!”

Chen Ping’an recalled her earlier gaze, his intuition stirring. He released the sword hilt, resting one hand behind him while the other rubbed the sword-raising gourd, smiling, “Let’s split it fifty-fifty, and I agree.”

Liu Boqi narrowed her eyes, “Don’t try to take advantage; knowing when to stop is a good habit.”

Shi Rou sighed, looking regretful, as if trying to persuade Chen Ping’an, fearing that he might end up fighting with Liu Boqi. She gently said, “Young Master, why not just let it go? You’re not just someone from the mountains; having a good reputation isn’t bad. Let the immortal take a big advantage and end this matter. You still have to stay in Qingluan Country and see the argument between Buddhism and Daoism, plus visit old friends. Reputation and word of mouth are very important for those scholars who care about their image.”

Chen Ping’an, with one hand behind him, gave Shi Rou a thumbs up.

Liu Boqi shot a glance at Shi Rou, “You, a ghostly woman, hiding in the skin of a decrepit old man, don’t you feel disgusting?”

Shi Rou smiled and said nothing.

The Liu family group drew closer.

Liu Boqi reached out and grabbed hold of her life weapon, the armored sword. Then, pulling out a tiny hand-held gourd, she stored the slug within, whispering to Chen Ping’an, “We’ll split it when this is over.”

Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile, “Sure.”

——

The entire Liu family, including the lame Liu Qingshan, was deeply grateful for the combined efforts to subdue the demon, especially thanking Liu Boqi and Chen Ping’an.

Liu Qingshan, his eyes red, found an opportunity to bow to the middle-aged female crown first, followed by Chen Ping’an and the others.

Liu Boqi pursed her lips and remained silent.

That night, a dust-clearing celebration banquet was held in the Lion Garden. Liu Boqi still appeared expressionless, only occasionally picking up her chopsticks. Even though she found it dull and a waste of time, she stayed until the banquet ended.

The next day, Liu Qingshan unexpectedly stood shoulder to shoulder with Liu Boqi, inviting Chen Ping’an to enjoy the sights in the Lion Garden.

Chen Ping’an declined, but after some persuasion, he had no choice but to stroll with them.

As they walked, Liu Boqi shot a cold glance at Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an ignored her.

The sun was just right today. After gaining Chen Ping’an’s agreement, Pei Qian eagerly volunteered to dry books and bamboo slips in an empty space in the Lion Garden.

After finishing her busy work, Pei Qian squatted on the ground, satisfied.

Two figures approached from a distance, and Pei Qian recognized their identities: the old gentleman named Fu Sheng and the middle-aged Confucian scholar surnamed Liu, who was the teacher at the Lion Garden academy.

So, Pei Qian didn’t stop them from coming closer.

The middle-aged scholar stopped at a distance.

Only the old gentleman walked over to Pei Qian, smiling, “Little girl, may I take a look at the text on the bamboo slips?”

Pei Qian stood up and ceremoniously bowed, calling him “Old Master Fu.” After a moment, she squatted back down and waved her hand, “Go ahead. It’s not something shameful; it’s something my master painstakingly transcribed from books or heard from others during his travels.”

Just like Zhu Lian’s recent offhand remark about the hardships of life, which was the best lesson.

She had also meticulously written it down in the bamboo slip, but Pei Qian disliked that particular slip, so she placed it at the very edge, all alone.

After all, she felt that slip didn’t compare to any of her master’s other bamboo slips.

Pei Qian tilted her head, seriously stating, “Old Master, just so you know, if I let you see these treasures my master has collected and he gets angry, you’ll take the blame. You don’t know how strict my master is with me; sigh, what can I do? My master likes me, right? Copying books, practicing stances, all that… I guess you wouldn’t understand these things. Old teachers studying in the study probably don’t even know how much a steamed bun costs.”

Pei Qian earnestly warned, “Old Master, you can’t let my good intentions go unrewarded! Deal?”

The old scholar beamed, “Deal!”

Thus, the two squatted down together, the old man browsing through the bamboo slips carefully, gingerly picking them up and placing them down.

This relieved Pei Qian.

After reviewing about half of the slips, the old man smiled and asked, “A fist the size of a head contains the greatest truths of the world. Little girl, do you believe in this saying?”

Pei Qian answered without hesitation, “Of course! Otherwise, I’d be so small, practicing stances and training fists, honing my swordsmanship—what for? The world is dangerous, and there are many bad people out there.”

Pei Qian had wanted to say something about her grand ambitions but suddenly remembered Old Wei’s words about the dangers of close relationships in the jianghu, so she held back, deciding to keep her heartfelt words to herself. Just her master knowing was enough.

The middle-aged scholar frowned habitually at a distance.

The old man, however, laughed heartily.

Pei Qian didn’t understand what was so funny, and while turning some nearby bamboo slips to sunbathe, she said, “But my master taught me that to explain this truth, you must talk about the sequence; the sequence cannot be wrong. First, one must speak reasonably when dealing with people. Then, when your fists are strong, it’s easier to reason with those who don’t reason. It’s not just about advising people to only think about how hard their fists are, and then forget about being cautious, self-disciplined, and self-reflective. Sigh, my master says I’m young, and I should just remember these things, whether I understand or not; they’re all waiting for me in books.”

Pei Qian concluded, “So, Old Master, the truth you said is valid, but it’s not complete.”

The middle-aged scholar’s expression softened slightly.

The old man did not mock Pei Qian but remained silent.

Pei Qian’s eyes sparkled, “Old Master, is my master’s knowledge vast?”

The old man replied, “From just these few words of your master, one cannot tell if his knowledge is vast or not. However, at least… it’s certainly correct. Although it sounds simple, it’s quite difficult to practice, and even more so to live by.”

Pei Qian raised an eyebrow, annoyed, she blocked the old man’s path to continue browsing through the bamboo slips, crossing her arms, “Then Old Master, you should look at fewer bamboo slips.”

The old man laughed, “Oh, you little girl, holding a grudge.”

Pei Qian nodded, “Respecting the elderly and loving the young, you’re old, I’m young; we’re even now. Don’t think of taking advantage of a little girl.”

The old man could only say, “Your master teaches well, and it’s even more precious that he can preserve your spirit and energy. Your master is quite impressive.”

Pei Qian first smiled happily, then shook her head, saying, “Old Master, since you say that, do you want to see more bamboo slips? Fine, fine, go ahead. I’m afraid of you old scholars; you have a whole set of rules and principles. Sigh, it’s exhausting.”

This made even the middle-aged scholar smile a bit.

The Great Sage once wrote a book whose main purpose was merely to think without evil.

To the extent that a later great sage, in order to uphold the moral purity of the Great Sage, found it quite challenging to annotate and explain without arbitrarily removing some sections.

This made Old Fu chuckle.

The middle-aged scholar found this very reasonable.

It seemed this was an issue facing all schools of thought, from emperors to ministers, throughout the world.

Yet the middle-aged scholar felt that today, Old Fu looked somewhat strange; he actually laughed.

Having stayed in the Lion Garden for so long, he had never laughed before.

After browsing through the bamboo slips, the old man stood up, watching the little cocoa girl who was still diligently flipping through the slips under the sun. He wanted to lend a hand, but Pei Qian quickly waved him off, wiping the sweat from her forehead with her arm, smiling, “I respect the elderly very much; no need for you to help. If my master sees, he’ll definitely pull my ears.”

The old man laughed as he took his leave, gesturing for her not to rise to salute, a way of showing he cared for the young.

The two scholars walked side by side along the tree-lined path.

The middle-aged scholar hesitated to speak.

Old Fu, with a calm smile, said, “If nothing unexpected happens, that young man is the closed-door disciple of the old scholar.”

The middle-aged scholar’s expression grew complex.

Old Fu sighed, “Let’s not bother with that.”

The middle-aged scholar nodded, asking, “So when will you take Liu Qingshan as your disciple? I feel he has passed this major test.”

Old Fu shook his head, “Not yet; reading thousands of books in the study means understanding principles, but knowing how to act requires Liu Qingshan to travel many miles and see more people and things.”

The middle-aged scholar inquired, “Are you planning to take Liu Qingshan back to Central Earth? To hand over those rare texts you saved back then to him?”

Old Fu pondered, “I may not necessarily accompany this child on his travels; that would be too conspicuous and may not be a good thing.”

This man, once praised for “keeping the Confucian flame alive for the world,” suddenly laughed, “Though the old scholar and we come from different lineages, one must admit that his eye for selecting disciples has improved, from Cui Dongshan to the likes, and now to Qi Jingchun… it’s an upward trend.”

The middle-aged scholar shook his head, “That young man, at least for now, does not deserve your praise, Old Fu.”

——

The lame Liu Qingshan brought Chen Ping’an and Liu Boqi to sit in his study.

Liu Boqi immediately noticed the small wooden box containing the hunting treasure of a fallen dynasty’s last emperor. In the hands of a Qi cultivator with limited vision, it was merely a small gold nugget, worth at most a few small coins.

And of course, she belonged to that category of cultivators with limited vision.

She had some ideas.

Afterward, the Lonely Young Master and maid Meng Long left the Lion Garden first, taking only those two mundane antiques.

The couple of cultivators who continued with them were unknown to have acquired a heap of divine money from the Liu clan, returning home with an abundant harvest.

Then, the couple of Daoist cultivators departed, also leaving with a prosperous bounty, their pockets filled with small coins far exceeding expectations, rejoicing in their fortune.

Chen Ping’an originally wanted to leave early, but he had been held back by Liu Qingshan and ended up staying for three more days, exploring every corner of the Lion Garden.

Liu Qingshan occasionally showed a hint of worry, so he invited Chen Ping’an to drink each time.

Chen Ping’an knew it was about the household matters concerning the embroidered building, but he wouldn’t meddle in that.

During those days, Liu Boqi visited Chen Ping’an’s small courtyard twice; once to tell him she had severely beaten that Liu tree goddess and that she should behave for the next hundred years, and another time to split the spoils with him.

The transformed treasure demon couldn’t simply be halved with the armored sword; in fact, any earth immortal treasure demon could yield great rewards if properly raised or tamed.

Of course, if one were to kill it and seize the treasure, that would also be a huge fortune.

Thus, Liu Boqi converted it into a sum of Gu Yu money, as Chen Ping’an’s reward.

After Liu Boqi left, Chen Ping’an and Pei Qian looked at the small pile of coins on the table. Pei Qian beamed, and Chen Ping’an smiled back, ruffling Pei Qian’s hair, “Then I won’t pull your ears.”

Pei Qian was confused, “Huh?”

Chen Ping’an bent over the table, not giving her an answer, gazing at the mountain of Gu Yu coins.

Pei Qian crossed her arms, straightening her back, not wanting to think about that phrase, happily asking, “Master, I’m not a burden this time, right?”

Chen Ping’an sat up, smiling as he stretched out both hands, squishing Pei Qian’s cheeks into a round and flat shape.

Zhu Lian sat at the door, engrossed in her book. When she reached an exciting part, she was reluctant to turn the page.

She somewhat missed that old predecessor, Xun.

Shi Rou shot a glance at Zhu Lian’s book, nearly infuriated.

On the last day in the Lion Garden, just as Chen Ping’an and the others were about to depart for the capital, early in the morning, Liu Boqi came alone, handing over the hunting treasure that Chen Ping’an had taken from the wooden box, her face expressionless as she said, “This is what Old Liu promised you. It belongs to you now. If you use it to refine your life weapon, it will be exceptional. Because this small gold nugget not only carries the cultural essence of a secular dynasty but after resting in the Lion Garden for hundreds of years, it also contains the Liu clan’s cultural essence. It’s useless to me, but once you, Chen Ping’an, successfully refine it, it will be of great benefit to you, a half-baked scholar. Most importantly, even if you already have a life weapon of the five elements gold, you can still refine and merge this one, potentially raising your original life weapon’s grade, making your future path of cultivation much more effective.”

Chen Ping’an held the small hunting treasure, examining it for a moment before returning it to Liu Boqi, whispering, “Help me sneakily put it back in Liu Qingshan’s study, but remember to hide it well.”

Liu Boqi frowned, “You don’t want it? Do you think I’m trying to deceive you, doubting the authenticity of this hunting treasure?”

Chen Ping’an didn’t bother explaining.

He called for Pei Qian, who had already slung her bag over her shoulder and was holding her walking stick, and left the courtyard, heading down the quiet path outside the Lion Garden.

Liu Boqi remained in the courtyard, suddenly smiling.

If Chen Ping’an dared to accept it, she would have no choice but to kill him.

So why did Chen Ping’an refuse such a rightful gift? Was it because he sensed her motives and didn’t dare to accept it, or was he really just unwilling?

Liu Boqi didn’t think too deeply; since the hunting treasure had been left, Chen Ping’an’s thoughts were none of her concern.

Pei Qian hopped along beside Chen Ping’an, curious, “Master, why don’t you want that piece of gold? It looks quite appealing! And that female crown mentioned so many benefits.”

Chen Ping’an, throwing punches as he walked, smiled, “The Liu clan’s cultural essence is tied to it; if we take it, what will Liu Qingshan do? He even gifted you a book.”

Pei Qian thought for a moment and nodded, “That’s true; Uncle Lame is already so pitiful; let him keep it.”

Then, Pei Qian followed Chen Ping’an, practicing her stances.

Suddenly, she laughed, “Master, doesn’t this count as a gentleman not taking what others value?”

Chen Ping’an continued punching, moving slowly, shaking his head, “I’m still far from being a true gentleman.”

“How far? Is it as far as from the Lion Garden to here?”

“Probably further than from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land to the Lion Garden.”

“Is it that far?!”

“Indeed.”

“Master, no matter how far, we can still reach it, right?”

“Exactly. The premise is to not take the wrong path.”

Pei Qian suddenly stopped, standing still for a moment, waiting for Zhu Lian and Shi Rou to pass by. Afterward, she quietly reached behind her, clenched her fist, ran over to Zhu Lian, and cheerfully asked, “Do you want to know what I’m hiding in my hand?” 

Zhu Lian glared, “Get lost.”

Pei Qian turned to Shi Rou, “Sister Shi Rou, take a guess! If you get it right, I’ll give it to you!”

Shi Rou rolled her eyes.

Chen Ping’an had been enjoying the banter when he noticed Pei Qian smiling at him. Before she could speak, he quickly rapped her on the head.

(The End of This Chapter)**Chapter 396: A Bowl of Chicken Soup Unbeknownst**

As they exited the narrow path of Lion’s Garden, they passed by a small lake surrounded by lush green reeds. A turn up ahead would lead them onto the official road to the capital of Qingluan (青鸞国). However, just as they emerged from the view of the reeds, a sight met their eyes: a bullock cart, hastily maneuvered, had just entered the path from the official road. The road was narrow and bumpy, and as the cart jolted along, a young man in a blue shirt, sitting at the back, nearly bounced out, disoriented from the jolting ride. The one driving the cart was a bookish-looking boy, likely hurried by his master and driven by a youthful recklessness, as well as an unrefined skill in handling the bullock cart. The bull, in its exuberance, galloped down the narrow path, completely unaware that at the end of it, they would encounter a group of people. The foremost among them was a small girl, bouncing along merrily with a walking stick in hand. If they collided, it could spell disaster!

The boy driving the cart panicked, and the blue-shirted man grew frantic, one stumbling, the other shouting warnings. At that moment, Pei Qian (裴钱) widened her eyes, watching the bullock cart sway back and forth, as the old bull dragged along two clumsy fools, racing straight into the lake of reeds.

In truth, Pei Qian had already dodged the scene, taking refuge within a dense cluster of reeds. Even if the cart continued on its path, there was no danger of it hitting her.

But what was going on? Did someone decide to take a bath in the morning? Could it be a group of celestial beings? The bull seemed capable of pulling the cart while treading through water, exuding an otherworldly aura? After all, hadn’t she ridden a yellow cow not long ago, which proved quite miraculous, stable as it climbed mountains and crossed rivers.

Yet the scene before her didn’t seem to fit that narrative. The duo, one large and one small, started to shout, and with a splash, they disappeared beneath the surface.

Pei Qian shifted her stance, peering down the path from which the bullock cart had barreled out, watching as the entire cart plunged into the water.

She pinched her chin, lost in thought. She had heard that celestial beings merely needed to carry a Water-Repelling Pearl to traverse rivers and catch dragons with ease.

Zhu Lian (朱斂) and Shi Rou (石柔) dashed into the water to rescue both the people and the bull.

Chen Ping'an (陈平安) tugged at Pei Qian’s ear, scolding, “You need to watch where you’re going!”

Pei Qian stood on her toes, pleading for forgiveness, explaining, “How was I to know that the bullock cart would wander off the main road? It was swaying around like a drunken man, and then it just fell into the ditch! Ouch, that hurts… Master, I really did clear the way… Besides, you’ve seen bullock carts before, right? They’re always so slow, but this one was so impressive, it practically wanted to fly…”

Chen Ping'an released her ear, letting Pei Qian stand straight. She grimaced, rubbing her sore ear—it really hurt.

As expected, Zhu Lian’s words had come back to bite him, warning against being too complacent.

Chen Ping'an felt slightly relieved when Zhu Lian and Shi Rou quickly retrieved the master and servant, along with the bull and cart, from the water.

The boy, still shaken, sat among the reeds that the bullock cart had flattened, sobbing loudly.

Once the old bull was back on shore, it shook itself dry, inadvertently swinging its tail right into the boy's head, which made him stop crying.

The blue-shirted man, seemingly in his thirties, had a youthful face. After being rescued, he clasped his hands in gratitude towards Shi Rou.

Chen Ping'an approached, cupping his hands in apology.

The blue-shirted man, filled with shame, quickly returned the gesture, bowing repeatedly in contrition.

As he wiped the water from his face, his eyes lit up, and he asked Chen Ping'an, “Are you perhaps the Chen Gongzi (陈公子) who teamed up with the female Daoist to save us from Lion’s Garden?”

Chen Ping'an nodded and tentatively asked, “Are you the magistrate of Liu County?”

With a hearty laugh, the blue-shirted man replied, “I am Liu Qingfeng (柳清风), the elder brother of Liu Qingshan (柳清山).”

Liu Qingfeng, the eldest son of the late Minister Liu Jingting (柳敬亭), currently served as a county magistrate. While it wouldn’t be accurate to say he had skyrocketed to success, he had nonetheless made steady progress in his career as a scholar.

However, compared to his father, who was rapidly advancing in the official ranks and gaining a stellar reputation in the scholarly community, Liu Qingfeng seemed rather ordinary. At his age, Liu Jingting was on the verge of becoming a third-rank Minister of Rites in the Qingluan Kingdom and was recognized as a leading figure in the literary world. Thus, it was no wonder that people sighed about the contrast between the father and son.

It was widely accepted that after Liu Jingting's passing, he would receive a first-class posthumous title from the court. The only question was whether it would be “Wen” (文) for “Literature,” “Zhong” (忠) for “Loyalty,” or the somewhat lesser “Gong” (恭) for “Respect.” Both titles would require a special decree from the Emperor and could not be decided by the ministers alone. Previously, the court believed the first option had a higher chance, but after Liu Qingshan’s injury, expectations were greatly diminished. It was hard to say whether he would even be honored with the titles of “Wen” or “Zhong.”

Chen Ping'an called out to Pei Qian.

Having been like a deer caught in headlights, Pei Qian felt liberated and ran over to Chen Ping'an, apologizing with deep bows to Liu Qingfeng and the bookish boy, loudly recounting her various blunders.

In her heart, Pei Qian didn’t feel she had done anything too wrong. She even harbored some resentment towards Liu Qingfeng for not being more competent. But what could she do when her master was angry? Whether it was an apology that wouldn’t cost her any flesh or being forced to compensate with silver, even if it meant digging through her treasure box, she would have to comply.

Liu Qingfeng quickly defended Pei Qian, which made her feel somewhat better, thinking this county magistrate was quite reasonable.

Afterward, he insisted on inviting Chen Ping'an to return to Lion’s Garden with him. However, when Chen Ping'an mentioned wanting to head to the capital to catch the tail end of the debate between Buddhism and Daoism, Liu Qingfeng felt embarrassed to press further.

Chen Ping'an first helped Liu Qingfeng fix the bullock cart before they bid each other farewell and continued on their respective journeys.

Once they turned onto the official road, Zhu Lian remarked, “I think Liu Qingfeng, the eldest son of the old minister, seems more like the type to be an official than his brother Liu Qingshan.”

Chen Ping'an didn’t express any opinion on that.

Liu Qingshan had a stronger scholarly aura, greater talent, and was more virtuous, while Liu Qingfeng appeared less sharp and lacked any clear edges.

However, Chen Ping'an believed both brothers were the type of scholars needed in the world, nothing more. As for who would achieve more in the future, in the end, weren’t they both part of the Liu family from Lion’s Garden?

Chen Ping'an asked, “Pei Qian, do you know what the most admirable thing about Liu County’s magistrate is?”

Pei Qian replied without hesitation, “He’s an official with a good temper, who doesn’t act all high and mighty?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, saying, “It’s the sincerity that allows him to put himself in dangerous situations just to give way to you.”

Pei Qian responded with an “Oh,” seeming to understand, “Master, I’ll remember that, just like when I was sunbathing the bamboo slips in Lion’s Garden a couple of days ago. When the sun was blazing, I would occasionally flip through those things.”

Chen Ping'an hummed in acknowledgment, gently ruffling her hair, and didn’t say anything more.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “Young master, if there’s a chance in the future, may I help you practice your punches?”

Chen Ping'an answered without hesitation, “Sure.”

Zhu Lian then turned to Pei Qian, “Did you see that? That’s sincerity. You must know that among pure martial artists, practicing punches is light and casual, without any benefit. If you want effective results, I need to show real skills. Once I show real skills, my punches will carry killing intent, and I will have murderous intent. If, by chance, I actually have ulterior motives and hidden malice, I can conceal it well. Yet, the young master still trusts me. That’s sincerity.”

Pei Qian still seemed to grasp only bits and pieces, pondering, “Old cook, every day in Lion’s Garden, after finishing reading, you would mumble how you felt anxious about being broke. If we miss out on those excellent books in the capital, and you mentioned that the spring palace illustrations from Qingluan are a unique treasure from Baopingzhou, wouldn’t that be painful to return empty-handed from such a treasure mountain? You’re really just trying to trick my master into giving you silver to buy books and those illustrations, right?”

Zhu Lian’s face flushed with embarrassment, and he rubbed his hands without saying a word.

Chen Ping'an decisively stated, “Practicing punches is fine, but there’s no silver!”

Zhu Lian grew anxious, “Young master, we actually made some money on this trip to Lion’s Garden. Although I didn’t have to fight much, my loyalty is evident!”

Chen Ping'an turned to Pei Qian, “You say it.”

Pei Qian raised her voice: “No silver! Any silver that goes into my master’s pocket isn’t silver anymore!”

Shi Rou walked at the back, sighing inwardly.

Look at this, it’s hard to change one’s nature; these three are at it again.

———

On their way, Liu Qingfeng was bombarded with complaints from the bookish boy, yet he did not retort and certainly didn’t use his status to pressure him. Soaking wet, they arrived near Lion’s Garden, and the bookish boy, after passing the stone cliffs and old trees, caught sight of the familiar outline of Lion’s Garden and lost all traces of annoyance. He had grown up here and had a deep affection for his childhood sweetheart, Zhao Ya (赵芽)…

Among the five children of the late Minister Liu Jingting, from eldest to youngest, their names flowed like “Wind, Elegance, Mountain, Green, and Gloom.”

After changing into fresh clothes, Liu Qingfeng rushed to his brother’s study, where he was told that the elder brother was already waiting.

The three of them took their seats.

Seeing Liu Qingfeng, Liu Jingting sighed with relief, his mind relaxing as much as if he had seen a monster being captured.

It might be hard for everyone to imagine that, whether it was Chen Ping'an, the visiting Xianshi, or even the majority of people from Lion’s Garden, they were all unaware that the true backbone of Lion’s Garden was not the head of the family, Liu Jingting, who held a high official rank and had a brilliant reputation, but rather Liu Qingfeng, who held a low position and was of average talent. When Liu Boqi (柳伯奇) had peeked in on the trio drinking, he had focused more on Liu Qingshan and failed to discern the nuances of their gathering. The gradual shift in the mindset of the three of them was organic, a natural evolution. Liu Qingfeng, being practical and dedicated to accomplishments, had long ago assumed the role of a guest scholar or advisor to Liu Jingting. In contrast, Liu Qingshan spent most of his time in Lion’s Garden focusing on his studies, while Liu Qingfeng had accompanied their father in the capital, thus becoming far more familiar with the political intricacies of Qingluan Kingdom.

Liu Qingfeng laughed, “Father, I’ve already read the letters you sent to the county office.”

Liu Qingshan felt a bit uneasy as he noticed his elder brother looking at him with a smile.

Suddenly, Liu Qingfeng burst into laughter.

Liu Qingshan’s face turned slightly red, “Elder brother!”

Liu Jingting lamented, “Regarding the matter of Lady Liu Shu, if I had listened to you sooner and spoken candidly with her, perhaps our relationship wouldn’t be so strained now.”

Liu Qingfeng reassured him, “Father, whether in human affairs or divine matters, it all boils down to innate tendencies. It isn’t something we can change with just a few heartfelt words. Thankfully, Lady Liu Shu shares the glory and disgrace of our Liu family. This calamity serves as a warning for her; sometimes misfortune brings hidden blessings. We owe this to the chivalrous Chen Gongzi and the female Daoist well acquainted with Qingshan… what was her name again?”

Liu Qingshan, feeling embarrassed, shouted, “Liu Boqi! Elder brother, are you done yet?!”

Liu Qingfeng, suppressing his laughter, asked seriously, “Do you truly have feelings for her?”

Liu Qingshan felt a bit shy, glancing around.

Liu Jingting hesitated and then said helplessly, “That female Daoist is after all a practitioner from the mountains. Regarding the situation in Lion’s Garden, we cannot be overly grateful. However, when it comes to your lifelong matters, sigh, it’s a tangled mess.”

As the old Minister of Rites of Qingluan Kingdom, he was no stranger to interactions with Xianshi or passing Daoists. Coupled with the strong influence of the Tang dynasty emperor, he maintained a firm posture even in front of the renowned figures of the sects. 

Yet, a fair official finds it hard to resolve family matters.

Liu Qingfeng exchanged glances with his father, signaling that he understood, then turned to Liu Qingshan, saying, “Qingshan, I trust you. If you truly have feelings, then your feelings are sincere. You’ve considered her appearance, family background, and character, and I believe in your judgment. As your elder brother, I won’t meddle in your affairs. Therefore, let’s assume that Lady Liu Boqi, the female Daoist from another realm, could potentially become your legitimate wife. We must consider two things: first, as a practitioner, she shouldn’t be expected to deal with mundane matters like cooking and household chores. But we need to ask if she is willing to cultivate with us in Lion’s Garden and treat you with the respect due to a husband. Or, after some time, will she consider herself superior due to her status as a mountain practitioner, and start to interfere in the affairs of Lion’s Garden?”

“Secondly, Qingshan, has she ever hinted that you should abandon all scholarly pursuits and leave Lion’s Garden to ascend the mountain with her?”

“Love between men and women often begins beautifully, enchanting at every turn, just like Lion’s Garden, nestled between green mountains and clear waters, resembling a paradise. However, when push comes to shove, how will it be? If Lady Liu Shu had not truly felt stuck, she might have long abandoned Lion’s Garden to escape. The good relationships and incense ties built over seven generations by the Liu family will ultimately be tested if Lady Liu Shu’s words hurt us deeply in front of so many ancestral tablets.”

“So, Qingshan, I’m not saying you shouldn’t be with Liu Boqi. I just hope you understand that the mountain and the mundane world are two different realms. The customs of scholarly families and practitioners differ greatly. After marriage, will Lady Liu Boqi accommodate you, or will you have to yield to her?”

“Also, while Liu Boqi has done a great service to Lion’s Garden by subduing demons and saving our family from disaster, you need to be clear: the Liu family does not expect you to bear this debt alone. From our father to me, and the entire Liu family, we can share this debt across generations. As long as Liu Boqi is willing to wait, we will repay her kindness over time.”

Liu Qingfeng sighed, “Don’t blame me for being so mercenary. It’s better to think things through now than to suffer later. Regardless of what I say, I just hope you can live well. At the same time, I admit I have my selfish motives. The Liu family’s traditions and teachings should be upheld, and I don’t believe I have the capability to carry them forward. I still need you to inherit them.”

Liu Qingshan stood up, slightly crooked due to his limp, his demeanor relaxed. He cupped his hands and said, “I’ll go find out.”

Liu Qingfeng’s complex expression flickered briefly before he said softly, “There are many practitioners in the world. Qingshan, don’t worry; I can assure you that those who can be healed are completely fine.”

Liu Qingshan took this as his brother comforting him and smiled as he left.

Liu Jingting, however, with his experience from the public domain, recognized the mind of his eldest son, who was extraordinarily steady and had a broad mindset that far surpassed that of ordinary people, which made his expression subtly change.

After Liu Qingshan closed the door behind him, Liu Qingfeng, looking fatigued, said, “On the way here, I happened to encounter Chen Ping'an.”

Liu Jingting suppressed a tremor of surprise and asked with a smile, “What do you think?”

Liu Qingfeng nodded, “He’s an extraordinarily unique practitioner from the mountains, more like a genuine scholar from a noble family.”

Liu Jingting chuckled, “That’s indeed true.”

Liu Qingfeng hesitated, wanting to say something but stopping short.

Liu Jingting got up, placing a hand on his elder son’s shoulder, “It’s not for us to comment on family matters; in the future, Qingshan will understand your good intentions. As for me, to be honest, I don’t think you’re wrong, but I also don’t think you’re entirely right.”

Liu Qingfeng’s countenance darkened.

Liu Jingting continued, “Go check on Qingqing (柳清青). She is close to Qingshan yet respects you, so there are some things that you should say yourself.”

Liu Qingfeng nodded, “I’ll sit for a while. I’ll visit the two teachers first before heading to the embroidery building.”

Liu Jingting sighed, “That’s how it should be.”

The old minister left the study first.

Liu Qingfeng sat alone in the chair, turning to gaze at a pair of couplets hanging on the wall.

“Pen strokes like an army, poetry like a thousand steeds. Cultivating virtue to align with past and present, teaching descendants through the collection of books.”

This was not written by Liu Qingshan, the owner of this study, but rather a gift from Liu Qingfeng himself, inscribed for Liu Qingshan during his coming-of-age ceremony.

Liu Qingfeng's expression was somber as he left the study to visit the old scholar Fu Sheng (伏昇) and the middle-aged scholar Liu. The former was not at the academy, but Liu was present, so Liu Qingfeng asked him some questions regarding his studies before taking his leave to find his sister, Liu Qingqing.

After Liu Qingfeng departed, the old scholar Fu Sheng appeared out of nowhere.

The middle-aged scholar asked, “Master, is Liu Qingfeng’s action of dragging Liu Qingshan into the whirlpool of the three teachings in Qingluan Kingdom right or wrong?”

Fu Sheng smiled, “Didn’t someone say it? Yesterday is dead, today is born. What’s right or wrong today may not be right or wrong later; it all depends on the person. Moreover, this is a family affair of the Liu family. I also want to take this opportunity to see how much Liu Qingfeng has absorbed from the ancient texts. The integrity of a scholar can only be forged through hardships.”

The middle-aged scholar was at a loss. The master’s Buddhist perspective on the actions of Confucian disciples didn’t align with propriety. However, given the master’s esteemed status in the orthodox Confucian temple, he knew that his vision was far-reaching and would not meddle unless Liu Qingfeng strayed from his path. Had Liu Qingfeng not stepped forward in the ancestral hall to challenge Lady Liu Shu, he would have remained ignorant of the fact that the two teachers had stayed in Lion’s Garden for many years and eventually departed without a trace.

In truth, various opportunities in the world are often similar. They may differ in magnitude, as well as in the perspectives of the various schools of thought and mountain practitioners on accepting disciples, each with their own unique angles. Ultimately, it still depends on the individual being tested, whether they can grasp their own path. Daoist deities especially favor this approach, which is more convoluted and complex compared to Master Fu Sheng’s observational perspective, filled with ups and downs, life and death, familial and romantic ties, and many temptations that require testing. Historically, some renowned initiation processes took an extraordinarily long time, even involving reincarnation and experiences in blessed lands.

It’s a thrilling spectacle, grand in scale.

Fu Sheng suddenly said, “In fact, Liu Qingfeng would be a suitable direct disciple for you.”

The middle-aged scholar shook his head, “I know this person possesses good character and lofty aspirations, and he’s capable of handling tedious tasks. Unfortunately, he is not suited to inherit my particular teachings.”

Fu Sheng smiled and said no more.

He didn’t break the silence.

When the master imparts his teachings to his students, is it really as simple as having the students listen attentively to the master’s instructions? Can the students not also find gaps in the master’s knowledge and fill them in?

However, these things cannot be discussed by outsiders; they must be realized by oneself.

The Sage once expressed concern: as the scholarship of Confucian sages rises, and their status distances them from the mortal realm, what becomes of the world?

The responses vary among the sages, including the Li Sheng (礼圣), the Ya Sheng (亚圣), and Fu Sheng himself, along with the two deputy masters of the Confucian school.

Yet, the Sage still frowned.

Later, there came the emergence of the old scholar from the humble alley.

In that era, it shone brightly.

During the two debates among the three teachings, many brilliant disciples from Buddhism and Daoism resolutely turned to the Confucian school, and not just a few of them.

A young immortal from Baiyu Jing (白玉京), who participated in the debate, once asked, “Since you Confucians advocate that human nature is inherently good, and since everyone is born with a good nature, what then is the merit of Confucian education?”

The middle-aged scholar suddenly inquired, “What if Liu Qingshan travels far with the Daoist Liu Boqi and they eventually become husband and wife?”

Old scholar Fu Sheng, or the great Confucian sage Fu Sheng, laughed and said, “What of that? It’s merely a matter of perspective among the three teachings; we are just being earnest in our studies.”

The middle-aged scholar, still puzzled, pondered further.

Fu Sheng nodded and said, “Liu Qingfeng has roughly guessed our identities. Because Lion’s Garden has found an escape, it has led to today’s literary gamble involving Liu Qingfeng and the embroidered tiger of the Great Li.”

The middle-aged scholar snorted coldly.

Fu Sheng sighed, “If only there had been a few more like Cui Zhan and Liu Qingshan among the disciples of the old scholar back then, we might not have lost... or perhaps we still would have, but at least not so miserably.”

———

Liu Qingfeng stood at the foot of the embroidery building, asking the maid Zhao Ya to summon his sister Liu Qingqing down.

Zhao Ya hesitated.

In recent days, after Miss Liu learned the rough truth, she had been utterly heartbroken, especially upon discovering that her second brother, Liu Qingshan, had been injured because of her, even contemplating ending her own life. Had she not acted quickly to clear away the scissors and other dangerous items, Lion’s Garden would have faced a tragedy. Thus, she had kept a constant vigil, staying by Liu Qingqing’s side day and night. Over the past couple of days, Liu Qingqing had grown so emaciated that she looked worse than during her time of distress.

Liu Qingfeng said calmly, “Go call her down.”

Zhao Ya was startled and immediately ran upstairs.

Liu Qingqing timidly descended the stairs, not even daring to ask Zhao Ya for support.

Liu Qingfeng glanced at his sister but did not speak.

Liu Qingqing lowered her head, feeling anxious.

Since childhood, she had always feared this elder brother, who seemed to overshadow her younger brother Liu Qingshan.

Liu Qingfeng softened his tone, saying, “The sky isn’t falling. I’ll walk with you.”

Half an hour later, Zhao Ya anxiously stood in front of the embroidery building, watching for any sign of her mistress.

When she finally saw her return, there were traces of tears on her face, but it seemed she had opened up her heart.

Lifting her skirt, Liu Qingqing climbed back up to the embroidery building, with Zhao Ya following behind, confused.

Liu Qingqing suddenly smiled and asked, “Ya’er, will you accompany me to the mountains to cultivate?”

Zhao Ya was taken aback, looking at her mistress, who no longer seemed despondent, and nodded.

Liu Qingfeng walked alone through Lion’s Garden.

For a scholar, achieving the highest level of knowledge is no easy feat.

Since Liu Qingfeng had taken that step, it meant he was destined to crawl and struggle through the mire for the rest of his life.

The sorrow within Liu Qingfeng was indescribable.

What scholar doesn’t wish to immerse themselves in their studies, creating moral essays that would be remembered for generations?

What scholar doesn’t wish to have students across the land, revered as a leader of the literati and a champion of the scholarly community?

What scholar doesn’t desire to maintain integrity, to uphold the essence of Confucian teachings and forge new paths?

Yet, the most difficult task for officials is to remain virtuous; someone must tend to the trivial affairs, counting every penny for the common folk, and that responsibility falls to someone.

Fortunately, it is said that when a scholar reaches the pinnacle of knowledge, they can balance both scholarship and practical accomplishments.

At a small bridge by a flowing stream, Liu Qingfeng turned and saw Liu Qingshan walking alongside the female Daoist.

In the end, it was Liu Qingshan who approached Liu Qingfeng alone, smiling as he said, “I want to travel to Baopingzhou with Liu Boqi first. I plan to visit the Lake Academy and the newly built academy at the cliff of Daxui, as well as the one in Longquan County in the far north.”

Liu Qingfeng asked with a smile, “Have you thought it through? If you have, remember to inform the two teachers and see what they think.”

Liu Qingshan nodded, “Liu Boqi said my leg can be healed, but I feel there’s no rush. Otherwise, I’ll owe her a favor, and what if…”

Liu Qingfeng teased, “If you become one family, then you wouldn’t have to worry about such things.”

Liu Qingshan turned to leave.

Liu Qingfeng suddenly called out to his brother, saying, “On behalf of our ancestors and all scholars of Qingluan, I thank you. The Liu family’s scholarly tradition has not diminished over the years, allowing the scholars of Qingluan to hold their heads high.”

Liu Qingshan was puzzled, “Why is that? Elder brother, what do you mean? I don’t understand.”

Liu Qingfeng adjusted Liu Qingshan’s clothing with a smile, “Silly boy, don’t worry about this. Just focus on your studies and strive to become a sage of Confucianism, bringing glory to our Liu family.”

Liu Qingshan joked, “Elder brother, have you gone silly from being an official? You’re just a county magistrate now; what will you do when you become a Minister or a Grand Secretary in the future?”

Liu Qingfeng smiled, “We’ll see then.”

Liu Qingfeng asked, “When you bid farewell to the two teachers, may I have a word with Liu Boqi? Don’t worry, just a few sentences.”

Liu Qingshan nodded, “What’s the harm in that?”

Liu Qingfeng went to speak with Liu Boqi, who agreed. While Liu Qingshan went to find Old Scholar Fu and Teacher Liu, Liu Qingfeng took Liu Boqi to the Liu family ancestral hall.

Along the way, Liu Qingfeng remained silent.

Liu Boqi felt a strange sense of unease.

Of course, it mainly stemmed from her immediate affection for Liu Qingshan, and as she interacted with Liu Qingfeng and Liu Jingting, she always felt as if she were at a disadvantage in terms of seniority.

Yet, Liu Boqi also had a strange intuition that this Liu Qingfeng was not an ordinary person.

Liu Qingfeng stopped outside the ancestral hall and asked, “Liu Boqi, if my brother Liu Qingshan only had a fleeting lifespan as an ordinary mortal, what would you do?”

Liu Boqi replied, “I am now at the level of an Earth Immortal, and it won’t be difficult to rise to the fifth realm in the future. Therefore, I would be willing to delay a hundred years for Liu Qingshan.”

Liu Qingfeng then asked, “What if Liu Qingshan has a bright future and aspires to achieve the three immortals of Confucianism, with a genuine hope of succeeding?”

Liu Boqi answered, “As a Daoist, I would follow him wherever he goes. If anyone dares to hinder my husband’s path to greatness, they must first ask my saber, the fierce beast, and my life-bound blade for permission.”

Liu Qingfeng shook his head.

Liu Boqi frowned, “Then what should I do?”

Liu Qingfeng said softly, “When it comes to important matters, especially those involving life and death, I hope you can stand in Liu Qingshan’s shoes and consider things from his perspective. Don’t let your first thought be, ‘I, Liu Boqi, feel this way is best for Liu Qingshan, so I will act accordingly.’ The path to greatness is fraught with dangers, and conflicts are inevitable. But since you’ve mentioned following him, I still hope you genuinely understand what Liu Qingshan wants. Therefore, I can tell you plainly that you will undoubtedly face some hardships in the future, even greatly so.”

Liu Boqi initially found the term “sister-in-law” awkward. However, hearing his words, she could only admire him sincerely, breaking into a smile, “Rest assured, your words have convinced me, my heart is settled! I may be strong-willed, but I can differentiate between good and bad!”

Liu Qingfeng felt a weight lift as he smiled, “My brother has great taste.”

Liu Boqi extended her hand towards the ancestral hall, “You, being an immortal from the mountains, only need to bow three times to our Liu family’s ancestral hall.”

Liu Boqi complied.

To her surprise, Liu Qingfeng also bowed three times from afar.

Liu Boqi felt a heavy weight in her heart.

Liu Qingfeng quietly said, “If nothing unexpected happens, I will soon be removed from the Liu family genealogy. At that point, I will no longer be Liu Qingshan’s elder brother. If Liu Qingshan receives a letter from home and wishes to abandon his travels, regardless of whether you are in Baopingzhou or the Central Plains, if he insists on returning to Lion’s Garden to seek justice from me, you must stop him and protect him, allowing him to continue his studies far and wide.”

Although Liu Boqi did not understand the reason behind this, she still nodded, smiling wryly, “So soon you want me to play the villain? Aren’t you being too familiar?”

Liu Qingfeng switched the topic, “I heard that you gave Lady Liu Shu a good thrashing?”

Liu Boqi began to feel guilty.

Liu Qingfeng squinted with a smile, “When I was little, I wanted to do the same. I thought I would need to wait another seven or eight years to achieve it, so I have to thank you.”

At that moment, Liu Boqi finally recognized and accepted the “Liu family tradition.”

In the distance, Liu Qingshan, limping, approached the ancestral hall.

Upon seeing his elder brother chatting amiably with the woman he loved, Liu Qingshan felt certain that if his brother approved, his marriage to Liu Boqi would likely be secured. He couldn’t help but smile, this young scholar felt that no challenge in the world could be insurmountable.

———

Chen Ping'an and his party smoothly entered the capital of Qingluan.

This was the second time, after Old Dragon City, that they felt the bustling prosperity of the human realm.

Chen Ping'an indeed gave Zhu Lian some gold and silver, allowing him to purchase those paintings and calligraphy that Shi Rou despised.

Chen Ping'an also found a century-old shop, buying several exquisite sheets of rice paper for a mere penny each.

Before entering the city, Chen Ping'an had already emptied the bamboo box, placing the items inside.

Cui Dongshan had previously mentioned the background of the ongoing debate in the Baihua Courtyard, which included the nameless Baiyun Temple in the Qingluan Kingdom. Thus, Chen Ping'an deliberately avoided that area.

He felt that they had already used up their good fortune in Lion’s Garden and should not draw attention to themselves by inadvertently stepping into the sights of the Jiang family and the Tang dynasty emperor of Qingluan.

While enjoying a hearty meal at a bustling tavern, the patrons from the capital excitedly discussed the nearing end of the Buddhist and Daoist debate, which had not truly concluded. Whether it was for venerating Buddha or following the Dao, their words couldn’t hide the pride of being citizens of Qingluan. This was, in fact, a manifestation of the national strength and fortune of the kingdom.

Chen Ping'an had seen such scenes in various places—among the scouts of the border army in the snow, among the common folk in the Great Sui dynasty, in the young girl riding in the carriage in Old Dragon City, and even on the Upside-Down Mountain.

Nearby tables were sharing a remarkable story that had just unfolded in the capital.

As Chen Ping'an listened intently, Pei Qian, noticing his focus, finally let up on the remaining half of the delicious roast chicken, perking up her ears to listen.

Zhu Lian stealthily reached out with his chopsticks, trying to snatch a chicken leg for himself, only to be blocked by the quick-witted Pei Qian. The two exchanged glares, chopsticks flying, and once Chen Ping'an reached for a dish, they both ceased hostilities. Yet, as soon as Chen Ping'an focused on his rice, Pei Qian and Zhu Lian resumed their playful rivalry.

Chen Ping'an couldn’t be bothered with the antics of these two but was curious about the seemingly coincidental gaming encounter.

It turned out that the day before, the capital had experienced a heavy rainfall, and a scholar seeking to enter the city had sheltered under an eave, while a monk with an umbrella was caught in the rain.

This led to an indescribable conversation, short in content but rich in meaning, inspiring countless interpretations among the tavern patrons.

At that time, the scholar asked the monk if he could share his umbrella to avoid the rain. The monk replied that he was in the rain while the scholar was sheltered from it, so there was no need to cross over. The scholar then stepped out from under the eave and stood in the rain. The monk, upon seeing this, bellowed and went to fetch his own umbrella. Ultimately, the scholar returned to the eave, lost and disheartened.

The patrons marveled at the monk’s profound understanding of Buddhism, declaring it true compassion and genuine Buddhist teachings. For even though the scholar stood in the rain, the monk was not getting wet because he held an umbrella, which symbolized the compassion of Buddha. What the scholar truly needed was not for the monk to shield him, but rather to understand how to rescue himself. Thus, he was awakened by the monk’s shout.

It was genuinely challenging for Zhu Lian to snatch a chicken leg from under Pei Qian’s nose. Instead, he poured himself a bowl of chicken soup, took a sip, and grimaced, “Not much flavor.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Deep down, you’re still a scholar, so it’s natural you find the taste mediocre.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Of course. Laboring hard yet not being appreciated; if it were you or the Liu brothers, you’d have to obediently take out your umbrella to shield that scholar from the wind and rain, escorting him home. Perhaps you’d step into a puddle, or he’d get wet from the rain, and you’d still be grateful. If it were some vulgar fellow, they probably wouldn’t care, walking away without a glance.”

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment and asked with a smile, “What if, after that shout, the monk lent the scholar his umbrella and walked through the storm together? How would this bowl of chicken soup taste then?”

Zhu Lian shook the bowl of soup, laughing, “It might taste a lot better.”

Shi Rou finally grasped the meaning.

Pei Qian was still confused, especially as she was busy munching on her chicken leg.

Chen Ping'an smiled at Pei Qian, “Don’t just eat the chicken leg; eat some rice too.”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, leaning back slightly and proudly proclaiming, “Master, I’ve been eating plenty!”

The Buddhist-Daoist debate in the capital of Qingluan had indeed given rise to many bizarre occurrences.

There were monks who smashed Buddha statues to use as firewood, and others who openly drank and feasted in the marketplace, shouting slogans like “Meat and wine pass through the intestines, but the Buddha remains in the heart.” Such actions were deafening and thought-provoking.

Conversely, the Daoists in Qingluan were comparatively quieter, and it was said that the immortals from various famous Daoist temples had gradually been losing ground in the ongoing doctrinal debates.

Especially notable was the case of the cat slaying by the high monk of the White Water Temple in the southern part of the capital. Initially, it seemed to be the Daoist immortals’ entry point for attacking Buddhism, but the eminent monks appeared to have anticipated it, delivering a solemn discourse that left the Daoists speechless.

Chen Ping'an shrugged off the rumors he had heard.

After finishing their lunch, he took Pei Qian and the others out for a stroll.

He bought a pair of exquisite celadon Go jars. The jars were larger than typical ones but remarkably elegant, a rare find indeed. The shopkeeper claimed that these were formerly used in the palace of the seldom-burned Yunxiao Kingdom, which seemed plausible.

Chen Ping'an had an eye for porcelain, given his background, and the key was that the jars included lids, not later additions, which made them expensive. The shop offered them for fifty taels of silver, and Chen Ping'an was happy to pay.

He also bought Pei Qian a small hand-turned gourd, charmingly nicknamed “Grass in the Gold,” tiny yet exquisitely crafted. Previously, in Lion’s Garden, Liu Boqi had used a similarly shaped gourd to capture the true form of a slug demon.

Of course, this yellow-skinned little gourd was merely a common, playful object.

Chen Ping'an took a liking to it and noticed that Pei Qian was also mesmerized, so he bought it.

In Pei Qian’s eyes, wandering the rivers and lakes should be like her master Chen Ping'an, with a vessel for carrying and drinking wine.

This small, evidently expensive little yellow gourd made Pei Qian feel it was just her size, and of course, she didn’t dare to ask for it. Seeing Chen Ping'an take the initiative to buy it, she immediately beamed with joy, cradling it carefully in her hands, exclaiming that she would have wine to drink now.

But a sudden chestnut hit her, causing her to squat down; though her head throbbed, Pei Qian was still very happy.

———

At the White Water Temple, the white-clad monk sat by the long-blocked well, murmuring, “We lost, we lost. It’s not the Buddha’s teachings that lost; it’s us who lost.”

The young monk’s face was streaked with tears as he gazed into the distance, “If the world learned from me, it would be like entering a devil’s den. I was wrong, I was wrong.”

———

At the Baiyun Temple in the capital, a middle-aged temple master was scolded by a nearby woman, whose child had lost a kite. The middle-aged priest hid far away while the little acolyte cried as he sought out his master, saying sorrowfully, “Master, why don’t we just chop down those trees? We’re constantly ridiculed by the neighbors, and now the pilgrims are driven away too. If this continues, we’ll really have no incense offerings and be starving, and you won’t be able to afford any books in the future.”

The middle-aged priest certainly wouldn’t chop down the ancient trees, but seeing his little disciple cry so hard, he could only comfort him kindly while leading him by the hand to the study. The little disciple, sniffling, was a seasoned Baiyun Temple acolyte, and after shedding tears, he quickly returned to his childlike innocence. He was actually quite fortunate; his senior brothers had been scratched by the aggressive women who complained about their morning bells and evening drums. In any case, every time the temple brothers went out, they felt like street rats, but they got used to it. Their master said that this was part of their cultivation. On hot summer days, when everyone couldn’t sleep, the master also struggled to find rest, rushing out to fan the air with them under the big trees. He once asked the master why, as cultivators, after performing so many rituals and practices, they should be calm and comfortable, yet still feel hot.

The master couldn’t provide a reason and only smiled.

The little acolyte would get angry and snatch the fan from his master’s hands, but fortunately, the temple master never got angry.

After settling the little disciple down, the middle-aged Daoist took out a Confucian elementary education book for the child to read.

Meanwhile, the middle-aged priest continued perusing a book on legalist philosophy on his table.

He had just read a sentence, “Governance is like bathing; even if one loses a hair, they must still go through it.”

He began to jot down his annotations, or more accurately, his reading insights, since the pages were already filled, he had to use the cheapest paper available to write down his thoughts and insert it within.

The little disciple was not fond of reading; he preferred the master to tell him stories from the books, so he put down the book and walked over to his master. Seeing the master writing rapidly, he looked at the book open on the table and turned to his master, curiously asking, “Master, what are you writing?”

The middle-aged priest set down his brush on his handcrafted wooden stand, smiling, “I just came across a saying from the legalists that resonated with me, so I’m jotting down some thoughts to reflect upon later. I want to recall my thoughts from yesterday and verify them against my thoughts for tomorrow. After repeated discussions and reflections, knowledge can transform from the sacred texts of the various schools into our own understanding.”

The little disciple responded with an “Oh,” still feeling a bit down. He asked, “Master, since we can’t bear to cut down the trees but are still scorned by neighbors, it feels like whatever we do is wrong. When will this situation end? My senior brothers and I are so pitiful.”

The middle-aged priest’s expression softened, and he smiled apologetically, “Don’t blame the neighbors. If there’s any resentment, then blame it on your master, because your master… still doesn’t know.”

The little disciple scratched his head. All Baiyun Temple Daoists wore square caps and did not don the three types of Daoist crowns: the hibiscus, fish-tail, and lotus. The little disciple looked eagerly at his master, “Then when will you know the answer to the solution?”

Although the “knowing” they referred to was worlds apart, the middle-aged priest sighed, patiently saying, “Still don’t know.”

The little disciple suddenly laughed, patting his master’s arm, “Master, we’re not in a hurry! Should I help you massage your arms?”

The middle-aged priest finished his annotations and thought for a moment before taking out a Buddhist classic containing nearly a hundred Buddhist cases. Yet he didn’t feel rushed to open it. He suddenly smiled, “The Buddha should be more troubled than I am. If the Buddha isn’t worried, what do I have to worry about?”

The little disciple whispered, “By the way, Master, my senior brother said the rice jar is empty.”

The middle-aged priest nodded slowly, “I know.”

The little disciple rolled his eyes.

The master would always say this, and in the end, Baiyun Temple would still have to patch up one wall by tearing down another to cope.

However, the little disciple suddenly noticed something strange; it seemed a gust of golden breeze floated in from the window, turning the pages of the master’s books and seemingly flipping through the entire room.

The little disciple blinked hard, realizing he had just been imagining things.

However, the master closed his eyes, appearing as though he had fallen asleep. The master must have been tired from reading, the little disciple thought as he quietly left the room, gently closing the door behind him.

———

Chen Ping'an raised his head, gazing into the distance.

Pei Qian asked, “What’s wrong?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “It’s nothing.”

(End of this chapter)### Chapter 397: The Bamboo Basket that Scoops the Moon

Everyone noticed something unusual about Chen Ping'an. Zhu Lian and Shi Rou exchanged glances, and Zhu Lian chuckled, “You go ahead and say it first.”

Shi Rou suppressed the discomfort in her heart. The lecherous gaze of this old man was likely to remain as revolting even a hundred years later. She whispered, “I’m a Yin entity, inherently suppressed by the capital's heavy grounds. There’s something in your field of vision that unsettles me even more. What about you?”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Just now, I sensed something when the young master turned his head to look. Shi Rou, your expression as you gazed into the distance was quite mesmerizing, albeit a bit dazed.”

Shi Rou, irritated, retorted, “Even Pei Qian knows to treat people sincerely. Don’t tell me you don’t understand?”

Pei Qian looked a bit wronged. “Sister Shi Rou, what do you mean by ‘even’? I study and write diligently, okay?”

Shi Rou could only offer a regretful glance.

Pei Qian waved her hands and began to piece together some philosophical insights she had read. “No one is infallible, and there are no unforgivable people in this world…”

Pei Qian quickly realized she was treading on thin ice, as soon enough, she found herself on her toes, being yanked along by Chen Ping'an by her ear.

Chen Ping'an scolded, “You don’t even grasp the profound teachings of sages from those books, yet you dare to flaunt them?”

Pei Qian immediately admitted her fault.

Her ear felt fiery with pain.

After enduring some trials and tribulations, she had somewhat grasped the gravity of her master's anger. If he merely knocked on a chestnut, it meant he was only mildly upset. But if he pulled her ear, it indicated he was genuinely angry. If he pulled hard, it signified serious ire. However, getting knocked on the chestnut and having her ear pulled paled in comparison to when Chen Ping'an was silently angry, not doing anything—no hits, no scolding—that was what Pei Qian feared the most.

Chen Ping'an found a bustling inn in the capital, located in the prosperous Chang Le Fang, near many bookstores.

However, at present, all the inns in the capital of Qing Luan Kingdom were fully booked. Only two scattered rooms were available, and the prices were exorbitant. The young clerk at the front desk had a look that clearly said he couldn’t care less whether someone stayed or left. Nevertheless, Chen Ping'an paid and checked in, but first had to show the clerk the official documents, which needed to be recorded. Later, the local authorities would conduct inquiries. When Chen Ping'an presented several household registration documents that Cui Dongshan had prepared in advance, the clerk confirmed they were in order and immediately changed his demeanor, meticulously recording the details and returning the documents with utmost respect, apologizing profusely. He explained that although the inn truly had no extra rooms, he would definitely inform Chen Ping'an as soon as a guest checked out.

Chen Ping'an smiled and agreed. Soon after, a young girl called out to the clerk, leading Chen Ping'an and his companions to their accommodations.

The clerk hurried to find the innkeeper, reporting that a group of travelers from the Great Li Dynasty had arrived.

The innkeeper was a rotund man whose eyes were almost hidden. Dressed in the fineries of a wealthy merchant, he was leisurely enjoying tea in a quiet side room. Upon hearing the clerk's report, he immediately erupted in anger at the clerk’s foolish demeanor, kicking him and scolding, “What are you dawdling around for? Do you want me to fetch you a cup of tea to quench your thirst? Since they’re noble guests from the Great Li Dynasty, why aren’t you rushing to serve them? Damn it, the Great Li iron cavalry is about to invade the Zhu Ying Dynasty. If they’re really a young noble from a prominent family in Great Li… Forget it, I’ll go myself. I don’t trust you to do your job…”

The young clerk, having failed to earn praise, was kicked and grumbled in return, only to receive a heavy slap from the innkeeper. “I can tell by your pathetic expression that you were looking down on them. If it wasn’t for you calling me ‘brother-in-law,’ I would’ve sent you out to pick up dog poop by now.”

The young man, who had only secured his position at the inn through connections, dared to complain only once he returned to the front desk. His beautiful sister was now a concubine for such a fat pig, which was quite… a fortunate affair. With no worries for food or clothing, adorned in gold and silver, whenever she returned to her dilapidated old alley, she resembled a palace lady, quite impressive, bringing honor to him as her brother.

The innkeeper personally took charge and managed to free up another room for Chen Ping'an. Hence, Pei Qian would share a room with Shi Rou, who was suited for night training and required no sleep, so the bed was solely for Pei Qian. Chen Ping’an was concerned that Pei Qian might feel uneasy about Shi Rou's Yin entity status and Du Mao’s appearance, so he asked Pei Qian first. Pei Qian, however, didn’t mind. Shi Rou certainly didn’t care either; if it were Zhu Lian sharing a room with her, that would indeed be a terrifying dragon’s den.

Life in the human realm was filled with trivial matters, and Chen Ping'an had long since become accustomed to paying extra attention. By being attentive, those around him could avoid many mundane tasks and focus on more serious matters. This was how he had assisted Li Baoping and others in their studies during their time in the Great Sui.

The two rooms were somewhat distanced from each other, so Pei Qian stayed with Chen Ping'an to copy texts first.

Chen Ping'an practiced the Heavenly Earth Stance, while Zhu Lian, with nothing to do, took up a monkey-like pose in the corner.

In reality, both Zhu Lian, who was already a martial artist at the distant travel realm, and Chen Ping'an, who had yet to reach the sixth realm, understood that martial arts lay in the daily minutiae—the stance of their fists while walking, the different techniques for climbing mountains and wading through water, and even their breathing while seated. They both had their own methods to nurture their martial intent while sleeping. As for Pei Qian, who was still young, she hadn’t reached that level yet. However, both Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian had to admit that some individuals genuinely possessed extraordinary talent for martial arts. Even in a path that stressed being grounded and offered no shortcuts, Pei Qian seemed to be making progress as if she were cheating, such as with the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops that Chen Ping'an taught her, which advanced so quickly that Chen Ping'an felt embarrassed at the dusty drug shop in Old Dragon City.

As Chen Ping'an finished his Heavenly Earth Stance, Zhu Lian, eager to try, was given the chance. Chen Ping'an, knowing what was on Zhu Lian's mind, let Pei Qian, who had finished copying, draw a circle on the ground with her walking staff. They would spar within that circle, stepping out would mean losing. The first time Chen Ping'an and Ma Kuxuan had their “long-awaited reunion” on the streets of the Colorful Garment Kingdom, they had used this method to determine the subtly hidden stakes. Had it not been for Chen Ping'an knowing that Ma Kuxuan’s protector from True Martial Mountain was secretly observing them, the two peers from Ni Ping Alley and Xinghua Alley might have directly fought to the death.

For Ma Kuxuan, whose parents had owned a dragon kiln from a young age, Chen Ping'an would not hold back. New grudges and old debts would eventually be settled when the truth was unraveled.

After Pei Qian finished drawing a large circle, she felt a bit distressed about the celestial technique Cui Dongshan had tried to teach her, which she just couldn’t grasp.

Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian stood within the circle, the area feeling cramped as they threw punches.

Zhu Lian naturally suppressed his martial arts realm, mirroring how Zheng Dafeng had fed punches to their group back in the day.

After a stick of incense had burned, Chen Ping'an knocked Zhu Lian back, who stumbled and rooted his feet in the circle. Chen Ping'an followed up with an elbow strike to Zhu Lian’s chest, sending him crashing to the ground. Chen Ping'an clapped both palms down to the ground, rotating his body gracefully as he swung his sleeves, resembling a spinning top, his feet tracing along the circle's edge as he circled Zhu Lian. However, Zhu Lian kicked him in the chest, sending him crashing against the wall.

Chen Ping'an pressed his palms against the wall first, absorbing all the force; otherwise, with Zhu Lian's kick, it would have been more than just breaking a wall. He finally landed gracefully and laughed, “I lost.”

Zhu Lian asked with a grin, “Did you learn all these strange moves from that final battle at the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, like when Ding Ying took my Dao crown?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Ding Ying’s martial arts were eclectic, and I learned a lot.”

After they sat down, Zhu Lian poured Chen Ping'an a cup of tea and said slowly, “Ding Ying is the most talented martial artist I’ve ever seen. His mind is sharp, and he revealed a heroic spirit early on. During the slaughter in Nanyuan, I knew I wouldn't succeed. Despite accumulating martial intent for a lifetime, it felt as if the spring thunder wouldn’t strike. Although I was severely injured at that time, Ding Ying held back until the very end before revealing himself. But honestly, if I had truly wanted to kill him back then, it wouldn’t have been hard to snap a chick’s neck. I simply let him go and even gave him that Dao crown, a relic of a fallen immortal. Little did I expect that after sixty years, this young man not only didn't disappoint me but his ambition surpassed my own.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “No wonder Ding Ying is so tight-lipped about that battle that launched his martial career. He probably doesn’t want to boast or reveal his shortcomings.”

Pei Qian angrily said, “You have no idea how much that old man made my master suffer.”

Zhu Lian smirked, “If I had known, I should have killed Ding Ying with one punch back then. Right?”

Pei Qian, gaining wisdom from her experience, glanced at Chen Ping'an, then at Zhu Lian, who had an expression that suggested he was digging a pit for her to jump into. She immediately shook her head, “No, no, that’s not right.”

Seeing her master showing no signs of showering her with chestnuts, Pei Qian knew her answer was correct.

She carefully placed the brush and ink on the table into Chen Ping'an’s bamboo box, poured herself a cup of tea, then suddenly stood up and whispered into Chen Ping'an's ear, “Master, I don’t know what’s going on, but now when I flip through books, the words seem much prettier than before.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “What do you mean by that?”

Pei Qian cautiously glanced at Zhu Lian, lowering her voice, “Before, those little ink characters looked like me—black and murky. But now, they look different, like who…”

Pei Qian began counting on her fingers, “The one who taught me swordsmanship, Huang Ting, the flirtatious Yao Jinzhi, the ill-tempered Fan Junmao, and Jin Su beside Aunt Gui. Master, I’m just saying, it was Old Wei who called Jinzhi a flirtatious beauty, not me! I don’t even know what flirt means!”

Zhu Lian burst out laughing, “You can give it a rest…”

Pei Qian rushed over, trying to cover Zhu Lian’s mouth, but Zhu Lian was too quick, dodging left and right as Pei Qian clawed at him.

Chen Ping'an watched the antics between the old and the young and reminded them, “Once we finish buying what interests us in the capital, we’ll visit a few famous historical sites. We’ll stay no more than two days before heading to the fairy crossing on the eastern side of Qing Luan Kingdom, directly to the Great Sui Cliff Academy.”

Zhu Lian dodged Pei Qian while nodding in agreement, “Of course, I don’t need to worry about the young master. I’m just afraid this girl is reckless, like a wild horse without reins. If that happens, it’ll be like a cart charging into the reeds…”

Pei Qian angrily shouted, “Zhu Lian, your mouth is always so black, I really won’t hold back!”

Zhu Lian was about to tease her further when Chen Ping'an said, “Let’s not have any more bad omens.”

Zhu Lian quickly nodded, “You’re right, young master.”

Pei Qian, sitting down, held her belly with one hand and pointed at Zhu Lian with the other, finally seizing the opportunity to take revenge, laughing, “You still have the nerve to say I’m opportunistic? You old cook, please!”

Zhu Lian replied solemnly, “What you do is called fence-sitting; what I do is recognizing the times, a wise choice.”

Pei Qian blinked her eyes, curiously asking, “Master said you were once a handsome young master in our Lotus Flower Blessed Land?”

Before Zhu Lian could elaborate on his past glories, Pei Qian burst into laughter, holding her stomach, “You can give it a rest, you’re killing me! Ouch, my belly…”

Zhu Lian noticed Chen Ping'an was also trying to suppress his laughter and felt a bit melancholic.

---

As the debate between Buddhism and Daoism was about to conclude, Emperor Tang of the Tang Dynasty quietly arrived at a summer retreat in the outskirts of the capital, as a distinguished guest had come to visit. Although Tang Li was a mortal ruler, he could not afford to be negligent.

The visitor was an esteemed elder from the Jiang clan of Yunlin, a reliable cornerstone of the clan, a master who was responsible for teaching the Jiang clan's youth, known as Jiang Mao.

In addition, there was the Jiang clan's legitimate daughter, who had just returned home after marrying into the Fu family in Old Dragon City, along with an elderly tutor who had accompanied her, rumored to be a formidable Yuan Ying sword cultivator.

Beside Emperor Tang were two individuals: an elderly royal who could put him at ease, Tang Chong, who technically was Emperor Tang Li's uncle and had corresponded frequently with the old minister Liu Jingting. Tang Li had read those letters during their quarrels.

The other was an eagle-nosed elder, the top figure among the genealogists in Qing Luan Kingdom, Zhou Lingzhi. Many had forgotten that this old immortal had humble beginnings as a wild cultivator but had assisted the Tang emperors for three generations. Although his reputation was not particularly good, Tang Li, having grown up in a royal family, saw the unified empire and eternal dynasty and did not care about such trivial slanders.

Upon meeting the venerable immortal from the Jiang clan, Tang Li, the ruler of Qing Luan Kingdom, despite his displeasure toward the local mountain immortals, had to show respect.

Both parties took their seats across from each other.

It was as if they intentionally blurred the lines of host and guest, with no one taking the role of a monarch.

The elder did not carry the airs one would expect, his conversation warm and inviting.

Tang Li had the officials from the Ministry of Rites present a large stack of documents and some scrolls recorded using the techniques of immortal inscriptions. A young official from the Ministry of Rites, who was well-spoken and composed, reported the progress of the debate on Buddhism and Daoism while Jiang Mao casually flipped through the documents and scrolls. The official reported the highlights with clarity, especially during the intense and thrilling moments, speaking straightforwardly. Despite facing a legendary master of the upper five realms, he managed to maintain an appropriate demeanor, asking questions and responding appropriately, which made Emperor Tang Li proud.

Tang Li was quite satisfied and turned to his uncle, Tang Chong.

The latter quietly introduced, “Song Shanxi from the Ministry of Rites, a student from the Song family in Qingsong County, second place in the autumn exam two years ago.”

Tang Li remarked, “Next time there’s an exam in the capital, he should be mentioned.”

Tang Chong nodded with a smile.

Suddenly, Tang Li asked, “Why isn’t Governor Wei here today?”

Tang Chong explained, “Governor Wei is close with a Jiang clan descendent named Jiang Yun, who was reunited with her sister here, so he went with her.”

The nominally highest-ranking immortal in Qing Luan Kingdom, Zhou Lingzhi, slightly trembled upon hearing Emperor Tang Li refer to Wei Liang as “Governor Wei.”

In the southeastern territories of Baoping Continent, people only knew of the hereditary Wei family governor in the central area of Qing Luan Kingdom, who had been the only direct descendant, and yet their legacy had passed smoothly.

Since the founding of the Qing Luan Kingdom by Emperor Tang Li, there had been many emperors, but the great governor Wei had remained unchanged.

This unassuming individual, who had a deep connection with the Tang family, was the person Zhou Lingzhi feared most in Qing Luan Kingdom, bar none.

Once the Yu Pu realm cultivator Jiang Mao finished listening and reading, he smiled and asked, “I heard that Liu Qingshan from Lion Park performed extraordinarily well after being added to the trials. Besides the written records, are there any scrolls we can view?”

Tang Chong shook his head, replying, “In response to Jiang Lao, someone reminded us not to enter Lion Park without permission, even our Zhou worshipper can only observe from the mountain peak outside Lion Park. However, based on the reports from spies inside and the insights from Zhou worshipper’s brief observations, Liu Qingshan, the son of Liu Jingting, truly passed on his own merit without any external assistance.”

Jiang Mao smiled, “Isn’t he the national master of the Great Li, Cui Zhan? What’s there to be cautious about?”

Tang Chong chuckled, “Precisely, it is Cui Guoshi.”

However, Emperor Tang Li felt quite uncomfortable.

The Qing Luan Kingdom was forced by the situation on the continent to collaborate with Cui Zhan and Great Li, and he, as the emperor, knew very well that in the face of such a powerful adversary, he had already fallen into a disadvantageous position. Jiang Mao’s nonchalant reference to Cui Zhan by name made it clear that he and the Jiang clan behind him did not hold Great Li and Cui Zhan in high regard. As for Qing Luan Kingdom, while they appeared courteous on the surface, it was evident that the Jiang clan looked down on the Tang family.

Although Tang Li felt displeased, he maintained a neutral expression.

To put it bluntly, if Jiang Mao were to spit in his face, this emperor of Qing Luan Kingdom would have to accept it with a smile, perhaps even asking if the old immortal was thirsty.

Jiang Mao did not continue to embarrass Tang Li. He pulled out a few scrolls that depicted two locations and two individuals: Baishui Temple, known for its crystal-clear springs, located south of the capital, and Baiyun Temple, which was less renowned in the capital. A young monk in white and a middle-aged Daoist priest occupied the scrolls. Jiang Mao nodded, “From the current situation, Buddhism seems to be winning in the public eye, while Daoism prevails behind the scenes. The Confucian disciples you brought forth from Qing Luan Kingdom’s Lion Park, Liu Qingshan, performed well. There may still be hope, but if you don’t present something more eye-catching, you might only be vying for second place. Is that enough? Whether Daoism or Buddhism becomes the national religion of Qing Luan Kingdom, is it?”

His tone was somewhat aggressive.

As the oldest and most prestigious faction in Baoping Continent, the Jiang clan had been a major family since before the establishment of the Confucian “teaching.” In this historic three-way contest on Baoping Continent, it was evident who the Jiang clan would favor.

However, if Qing Luan Kingdom, simply out of respect for Jiang Mao and the Jiang clan, were to elevate a religion that had nothing to do with the Buddhist and Daoist debate, namely Confucianism, to the status of state religion, everyone would see that it was the Jiang clan pulling the strings. The Jiang clan would certainly not tolerate such a “minor blemish” that could be criticized.

Thus, Jiang Mao was the most difficult to deal with; the results had to be satisfactory, and the process must not give any onlookers a chance to criticize or draw any negative attention to the Jiang clan.

As various scholars from neighboring countries flocked to Qing Luan Kingdom, they were already dissatisfied with this debate between Buddhism and Daoism, which had no participation from scholars. These foreign aristocrats, many of whom had bad tempers and were proud, clamored that if neither Buddhism nor Daoism became the state religion, they would move out of Qing Luan Kingdom. In truth, those at the core of the imperial court of Qing Luan Kingdom, along with the true Daoist immortals and Buddhist monks, understood that the dispute was merely about vying for second place, trying not to come in last.

Meanwhile, the emperor of Qing Shan Kingdom was keen on observing how the emperor of Qing Luan Kingdom would shamelessly curry favor with the Jiang clan and the tide of southern aristocrats, wondering whether he would end up the laughingstock of half the continent, displeasing both Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism.

Emperor Tang Li smiled as he rubbed his finger against the tea table.

Tang Chong spoke up, “The Great Li national master Cui Zhan is actually the one who put forth Liu Jingting’s eldest son, Liu Qingfeng, a Confucian disciple with exceptional learning.”

Jiang Mao squinted, “Oh? What makes him different from ordinary people? I’d like to see for myself.”

Tang Chong stood up, producing two yellowed books that had been prepared in advance, one a Confucian classic and the other a Legalist text.

Tang Chong intended to walk over and present the books.

However, before he could reach Jiang Mao, the books seemed to fly from his hands to land on the table in front of Jiang Mao, who casually tossed aside the Confucian text as if it were a waste of time. Few in Baoping Continent had the qualifications to discuss “rituals” in front of the Jiang clan, not because this elder looked down on others, but because his family background and personal knowledge supported his demeanor like a towering mountain.

Jiang Mao quickly flipped through the Legalist book annotated by Liu Qingfeng, reading swiftly. He shook his head dismissively at some points while nodding slightly at others. His gaze finally landed on a specific page where he noted a phrase that had been annotated three times, originally stating, “To love without being partial, to hate without causing harm, to treat all with their due.” Closest to this phrase, Liu Qingfeng wrote, “The word ‘due’ is inappropriate; it is too high; it should be changed to ‘fundamental’.”

Jiang Mao looked over the other annotations and smiled, “Not bad. Let’s see how that Baiyun Temple Daoist measures up.”

This venerable immortal from the Jiang clan, who was openly recognized as the highest-ranked, casually tore out the page with Liu Qingfeng’s seal and returned the books to Tang Chong’s table, saying with a smile, “Let’s find an opportunity for that Baiyun Temple Daoist to conveniently come across this book soon, and see what he has to say.”

Tang Chong agreed.

In contrast to the undercurrents swirling at Jiang Mao’s location, the atmosphere in the cool pavilion surrounded by green bamboo at the summer retreat felt much more harmonious and joyful.

The tall youth who had once obtained the iron chain from Li Zhu Cave was currently chatting with an elder sister who had married into Old Dragon City.

Governor Wei Liang sat nearby, casually conversing with the weary-looking tutor.

Jiang Yun looked at her sister’s appearance, smiling yet exasperated.

The woman raised an eyebrow, “What? Judging by appearance? I think I look quite beautiful.”

Jiang Yun laughed, “Sister, I must speak frankly. You don’t bear any resemblance to beauty at the moment.”

The plump woman rolled her eyes, “I want to see what kind of fairy you’ll end up marrying. At that time, I’ll have to keep an eye on you to prevent you from being fooled by a fox spirit.”

Jiang Yun clasped his hands together, begging, “No, please! I’m afraid your temper will scare away my future wife with just a few words.”

As the woman prepared to scold him, Jiang Yun cleverly changed the subject, “Sister, what do you think of Fu Nanhua?”

The woman shook her head, “He’s alright; he’s a good man. We don’t interfere with each other; we respect each other as guests, it’s very harmonious.”

Jiang Yun laughed heartily, “Then I must find this poor brother-in-law for a drink someday. We can share our troubles for days and nights, and we might just become friends.”

The Jiang clan’s daughter was indifferent, “Do as you wish.”

She suddenly remembered something and whispered, “Did your master find success in the treasure hunt with his close friends? If he did, I’d love to sneak along to Bee Tail Crossing. I’ve never seen a Liuli Golden Body after a great cultivator’s death. We have one at home, but our ancestor has hidden it away, and I’ve never been able to find it all these years.”

She whispered, “If you let me see that thing, I’ll give you a very special gift that will make you the envy of all the young cultivators in the continent.”

Jiang Yun waved his hands, “Forget it. My master has a terrible temper. If it involves something as significant as the shattered pieces of the Liuli Golden Body, if I dare to take matters into my own hands, I’ll regret it. My master once said I could either go to Li Zhu Cave or endure trials in the Divine Revelation Sect’s blessed land; I had to choose one. Yet when I returned, my master began to backtrack, saying that trials in the blessed land were also necessary. Since I’ve already been to Li Zhu Cave, it’s double the good fortune. He said while my luck is good these two years, if I find a treasure in the cave, perhaps I could also find a water spirit wife in the blessed land…”

Jiang Yun looked distressed, helplessly saying, “How did I end up with such a shameless master? It’s impossible to reason with him.”

The woman chuckled, “You’re truly oblivious to your own fortune. In the history of Baoping Continent, how many can rise to the upper five realms from a background of wild cultivation? Even someone like Li Tun Jing, who is high and mighty, respects you. You can’t complain; just be content. When you have time, return home and burn some incense for the ancestors. Thank them for their blessings.”

Jiang Yun’s expression remained indifferent as he shook his head, “Don’t try to persuade me to go back. I just can’t muster the energy.”

The woman sighed and flicked her finger against Jiang Yun’s forehead, “Since childhood, you’ve been so strong, yet you still can’t let go of those early matters?”

Jiang Yun said nothing.

He glanced at the tutor, who gently shook her head, signaling Jiang Yun not to ask.

During their silence, Governor Wei Liang and the tutor began chatting about the Bamboo Sea Cave and the Azure Goddess.

Wei Liang looked around at the lush green bamboo, jokingly saying, “Scholars and gentlemen all love green bamboo. I’d really like to chop down countless evil bamboos.”

The Jiang clan’s daughter teased, “Governor Wei, if you start chopping bamboo here, it wouldn’t be polite to leave our ancestor, who wants to discuss knowledge with you, behind, would it?”

Wei Liang laughed, “If I sit there, I’ll overshadow him; it’s against the duties of a minister.”

She was about to retort when Wei Liang, grinning, said, “Little Jiang, I’ve actually held you before when you were young. Time flies; in the blink of an eye, the little girl in swaddling clothes is now a young woman ready to marry.”

She glared at him, pulling out a piece of ginger she had loved since childhood and taking a big bite.

Wei Liang burst into hearty laughter.

Jiang Yun admired the scene immensely.

---

Recently, many had left Lion Park in the outskirts of the capital. With the troublesome monsters eradicated, outsiders departed, and even locals were leaving.

The eldest daughter, Liu Qingya, who had been trapped at her family home for a long time, hurriedly led her husband away first. Having been bitten by a snake once, she was now terrified of the rope. This time around, her husband had been thoroughly frightened.

Next, the two teachers from the Liu family school left together.

Following them were the second son Liu Qingshan and the female disciple Liu Boqi, who were preparing to ride far north to visit the Observation Lake Academy first.

Afterward, Liu Jingting’s youngest daughter Liu Qingqing, along with her maid Zhao Ya, headed to a certain immortal sect. Her brother Liu Qingfeng had taken leave from the court to escort her personally. The mountainside residence was not very close to the capital of Qing Luan Kingdom, over six hundred miles away. During his tenure, the old minister Liu Jingting had maintained a good relationship with the person in charge of that sect, so besides a generous gift for apprenticeship, he also wrote a letter for Liu Qingfeng to bring along. The letter conveyed that even if Liu Qingqing’s aptitude was poor and she wasn’t destined for cultivation, they still earnestly requested that she be accepted as a registered disciple, allowing her to spend a few years practicing in the mountains.

In reality, even if Liu Jingting were no longer a minister, as long as he was alive, it would be easy for his daughter Liu Qingqing to enter any immortal sect in Qing Luan Kingdom, and she wouldn’t even need this letter.

On the way, the two horse-drawn carriages moved slowly, with Liu Qingqing smiling more, and Zhao Ya naturally followed suit, feeling happy.

Liu Qingfeng mostly sat in the carriage reading. Whenever they stopped at a relay station along the route, he took care of relationships and interactions. It wasn’t just about being courteous as a noble; the local officials and clerks, regardless of their standing, were quite perceptive and slick. Liu Qingfeng, as a county magistrate, treated them with apparent humility and genuine respect, which was evident. Therefore, Liu Qingfeng didn’t seem like Liu Jingting’s eldest son, the leader of Qing Luan’s scholars, but rather became a topic of interest in every relay station.

Due to her status as a woman and her youth, Liu Qingqing couldn’t see the subtle details of her brother Liu Qingfeng’s behavior, but the attentive Zhao Ya was amazed, feeling that the eldest son in Lion Park was a completely different person from the county magistrate who had just exited it.

Upon arriving at the verdant mountain residence of the immortal sect, Liu Qingqing’s visit for apprenticeship went smoothly.

After Liu Qingfeng settled Liu Qingqing, he didn’t descend the mountain immediately, as he was led to a scenic high tower at the cliff’s edge. Upon entering, he saw a blue-clad old Confucian scholar leaning against the railing, along with a dashing young man.

Liu Qingfeng sighed inwardly, suppressing his complex emotions, and bowed, “Liu Qingfeng pays respects to National Master Cui.”

The Great Li National Master Cui Zhan had personally come to Qing Luan Kingdom.

Cui Zhan smiled and gestured for Liu Qingfeng not to be so formal, then pointed to the young man beside him, “Li Baozhen, from Longquan County, now the full authority holder of the Green Wave Pavilion in the southeastern region of Baoping Continent. You’ll be interacting frequently in the future.”

The dashing young man bowed to Liu Qingfeng, “I’ve met Liu Xiansheng.”

Liu Qingfeng could only return the gesture.

Li Baozhen spoke in fluent Qing Luan dialect, “Liu Xiansheng, this journey south to Qing Luan Kingdom has been an eye-opener. There are many remarkable individuals here. Just speaking of that Baiyun Temple Daoist, with such meager skills, dares to engage in Daoist actions and steal heavenly secrets. He’s truly crossed a chasm that even Yuan Ying Earth Immortals find difficult to cross. However, being so conspicuous, whether it’s fortune or misfortune, likely depends on the will of the Jiang clan.”

Liu Qingfeng smiled but remained silent.

Was this a show of power?
Such youthful arrogance and sharpness.

Li Baozhen waited for further comments, noticing Liu Qingfeng’s silence, and began to laugh.

Cui Zhan glanced at Liu Qingfeng and smiled, “Liu Qingfeng, in the future, when it comes to major matters concerning Qing Luan, Qing Shan, and Yun Xiao, you two need not worry. As for minor matters, you should teach Li Baozhen more.”

Liu Qingfeng nodded.

Li Baozhen appeared relaxed, smiling broadly, bowing deeply, “Thank you, Liu Xiansheng.”

The River God Temple, where Chen Ping'an had once inscribed on the wall, had recently received a group of extravagant worshippers who were staying inside the temple itself.

There were two people and one yellow cow.

This made the temple’s incense money collector feel apprehensive.

A slender young man in white, with a mole on his forehead, enjoyed wandering through the stele corridor.

This was none other than Cui Dongshan, who still lingered in Qing Luan Kingdom for some reason.

That night, with a full moon overhead, Cui Dongshan borrowed a bamboo basket from the River God Temple and filled it with river water, not a single drop spilling—quite miraculous. The more wondrous part was that the moon reflected in the water within the basket swayed along with the water, still bright and charming even as he walked into the shadowy corridor.

Cui Dongshan reached a corridor and sat on the railing, placing the bamboo basket beside him, looking up at the moon.

Only the bamboo basket filled with water and the moon within accompanied him.

Cui Dongshan’s thoughts drifted far away.

The Buddha worries over the suffering of all living beings, while the Most Sacred Teacher concerns himself with the Confucian teachings, which ultimately become merely the knowledge of those who are not hungry.

As for the Daoist ancestor…

It is said he is observing the One.

Perhaps the one trapped at the bottom of a well, Wang Zhu, is the One, and the old man at Yang’s Apothecary is also the One.

Or in the eyes of the Daoist ancestor, who has reached the highest Dao, is everyone simply the One?

Cui Dongshan rubbed his cheeks and took out two ordinary scrolls made of jujube wood from his sleeve, unfurling them before him.

One scroll depicted an old scholar in worn clothes, sitting in the middle of a long bench, with the young Cui Zhan beside him, while two other boys, one a young Liu Qingfeng and the other Qi Jingchun, sat on the other side.

Four people on one long bench felt slightly cramped.

A head intruded into the artwork that should have belonged solely to the teacher and students, tilting sideways with a radiant smile, extending two fingers.

In another part, a sturdy figure squatted in the corner, facing away from everyone.

The second scroll.

The one who had peered into the first scroll stood boldly in the center of the second, arms wide open, with the young Liu Qingfeng and Qi Jingchun holding onto his arms, their legs tucked under them as they dangled in mid-air, both boys grinning widely.

The youthful scholar Cui Zhan stood behind the man, smiling modestly yet sincerely.

---

Cui Dongshan wondered when he, Chen Ping'an, and that little black girl would leave behind such a scroll?
(End of Chapter)### Chapter 398: Encountering a Fellow Countryman in a Foreign Land

For the next two days, Chen Ping'an took Pei Qian and Zhu Lian to wander around the shops of the capital. Initially, he planned to leave Shi Rou at the inn to keep watch and avoid any unnecessary worries, but to his surprise, Shi Rou insisted on accompanying them.

The streets were bustling with activity, a result of the grand debate between Buddhism and Taoism. In this prime location of the Qingluan Kingdom, people from all walks of life mingled—those seeking fame, those seeking fortune, and of course, individuals like Chen Ping'an, who simply wanted to enjoy the sights and perhaps purchase some local specialties.

Pei Qian and Zhu Lian, being somewhat oblivious, didn't notice anything unusual about Chen Ping'an's fondness for bookshops. However, the attentive Shi Rou caught on to the subtle signs. Whenever they visited bookstores of varying sizes, Chen Ping'an would almost never touch the finely printed new books, nor did he show much interest in the classics of various schools of thought. Instead, he was drawn to obscure historical accounts and local gazetteers, often flipping through rare family genealogies that lay neglected in corners. Yet, after reading them, he would leave without making a purchase.

His behavior garnered quite a few eye-rolls from the shopkeepers.

Fortunately, Zhu Lian, who was generous with his money, stepped in to help Chen Ping'an avoid any verbal lashings from the bookstore owners.

Pei Qian figured that, since they were in the capital, Chen Ping'an had already spent a significant amount—first buying a dozen expensive sheets of the renowned Qingluan country xuan paper, then purchasing a pair of Qing-glazed chess jars for Lu Baixiang, and finally acquiring a hand-turned gourd. The expenses far exceeded his usual spending. Even when he spotted items he genuinely liked, he would only sneak a few glances. After all, the treasure box gifted by Yao Jinzhi was already brimming, leaving no room for more treasures. Maybe he could ask his master for a brand new treasure box next time? After contemplating, Pei Qian decided against it. Although their master had made some money this time during the Rain of Grain festival, she had also bought a trinket of her own. She thought that next time they earned some more, she would bring it up to her master.

Ultimately, they were still poor.

Pei Qian felt a twinge of sadness, wondering when she would be able to gather enough treasure boxes to fill with valuable items. The old chef had once told her that what was even better and larger than a treasure box was a treasure rack found in wealthy households. Once filled with items, it would truly dazzle the eyes, enough to make one’s jaw drop.

During their shopping, they overheard some rumors that were somewhat related to Chen Ping'an and his companions.

According to Zhu Lian, the Emperor of the Qing Shan Kingdom had unusual tastes that were "head and shoulders above the rest," which left many in awe. This ruler, who held great power in the Qing Shan Kingdom, had a preference for women with ample figures rather than slender beauties. Among the emperor's most favored concubines in the palace, four were far beyond what could be described as plump, each weighing over two hundred pounds. The emperor fondly referred to them as "Charming Pig," "Charming Dog," "Charming Bear," and "Charming Sparrow."

The most notable among them, Charming Pig Yuan Ye, was also one of the four great martial arts masters of over a dozen nations in the southeastern region of Baopingzhou.

Currently, Emperor He Kui was staying at the capital's post inn in the Qingluan Kingdom, accompanied by his four charming concubines.

Just two days ago, He Kui, dressed in casual attire, visited the city's temples with the comparatively "slender" Charming Sparrow among his concubines. While incense was being burned, a conflict erupted with a group of noble young men. Charming Sparrow's response was swift and fierce, leaving several of them severely injured, which caused quite a stir. The local authorities, including high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Rites, had to intervene, especially since it involved the diplomatic relations between the two kingdoms. After much effort to calm the situation, the troublemakers—noble youths from the capital and a few peers from the Southern region—quieted down upon realizing the identity of Emperor He Kui. However, just when things seemed to settle, a new wave of chaos struck that very night when several troublemakers, who had recently settled into their new residences in the Qingluan Kingdom, were found dead in gruesome fashion, reportedly causing even the coroner to feel nauseous.

Soon, credible reports spread throughout the capital that the method of murder was a signature technique of the formidable master Charming Pig, which involved dismembering victims while leaving their heads attached to their bodies and silencing them before they could scream, all while staunching their bleeding.

The court of the Qingluan Kingdom quickly mobilized resources to investigate, forming a team comprising experienced officials from the Ministry of Justice, court-sanctioned immortal practitioners, and renowned figures from the Jianghu to immediately enter the inn where He Kui was staying.

Yet, public outcry could not be contained as countless scholars and students surrounded the inn where Emperor He Kui was lodged. If not for the intervention of the local enforcers and the personal dispatch of 200 elite soldiers by the Grand Commander Wei Liang, who kept a watchful eye on the situation, it could have spiraled out of control. Those bookish scholars, who were hardly capable of defending themselves, would have surely faced fatal consequences at the hands of one of He Kui’s favored concubines.

Charming Pig Yuan Ye issued a challenge, stating that she would face off against another of the four great masters, Zhu Fengxian of the Daze Gang. Should she lose, the Qingluan Kingdom would accept the blame for the chaos, but if she won, the Qingluan scholars who had earlier caused a ruckus would have to kneel outside the inn and apologize.

Word had it that the notorious Zhu Fengxian, who had once stirred up bloodshed across several nations while driving a crimson carriage, was indeed in the capital, staying at a certain temple.

Then yesterday, the infamous Zhu Fengxian made his return to the Jianghu after thirty years, this time as the number one hero of the Qingluan Kingdom, arriving at the inn for a life-and-death battle with Charming Pig Yuan Ye.

As he departed the temple in his carriage, countless citizens of the capital and Jianghu enthusiasts cheered for him.

However, despite the high hopes placed upon him, the once-promising Zhu Fengxian was ultimately no match for Charming Pig, suffering severe injuries and losing to the second-ranked master among the four, Yuan Ye. Covered in blood yet not severely harmed, Yuan Ye seized Zhu Fengxian by the neck and swaggered to the entrance of the inn, surveying the stunned onlookers, before tossing the unconscious Zhu Fengxian out onto the street with the parting words: "Don’t forget to kneel and apologize tomorrow."

Zhu Fengxian was tearfully assisted into the carriage by his disciples from the Daze Gang and taken back to the temple for treatment.

Outside the inn, it was eerily quiet. Outside the temple, curses rang out incessantly.

Having coincidentally heard about this uproar while browsing through a bookstore, Chen Ping'an continued to search for books.

Pei Qian, carefree as ever, only felt pity for Zhu Fengxian, thinking he was quite unfortunate. Lacking true skill and yet seeking the limelight, didn’t he know he should have hidden away in the temple? He had ended up nearly beaten to death by that two-hundred-pound Charming Pig. Furthermore, a once-great reputation was now tarnished; in the Jianghu, a person without a name was as good as dead. Pei Qian's only regret was that during their previous visit to the Jin Gui Temple, they had stayed at that splendid mansion built for Zhu Fengxian's granddaughter halfway up the mountain. He was once a wealthy and extravagant figure, and she had rather liked him. But now, it seemed that even if that old man survived at the temple, the next time they met, she probably wouldn’t even be able to share a meal with him.

The last time they had encountered one another, they had first sought shelter from the rain together and then climbed the mountain. Eventually, Zhu Fengxian's granddaughter, Zhu Ziyang, and Liu Qingcheng, a girl from the Yanzhi Studio of Yunxiao Kingdom, became direct disciples of the immortal Zhang Guo at Jin Gui Temple.

Pei Qian and Chen Ping'an had witnessed that elaborate apprenticeship ceremony, which lasted almost an hour. By the end, it had made Pei Qian's head spin, forcing her to stand still like a wooden puppet, feeling more exhausted than if she had been copying books.

As Chen Ping'an stepped out of the bookstore just past noon and stood on the steps, deep in thought, Zhu Lian quietly asked, "Young Master, what do you say?"

Shi Rou's heart was tense, silently wishing, *Don’t get involved, please don’t wade into this mess.*

Chen Ping'an's answer brought mixed feelings to Shi Rou.

Chen Ping'an said, "Let’s go see Zhu Fengxian. If his injuries are severe, I happen to have some pills on me. After delivering them and checking on him, we’ll leave the temple."

Zhu Lian praised, "Young Master, you’re so caring and yet so steady."

Pei Qian rolled her eyes and snapped, "What do you mean stealing my lines? What if the old chef has finished speaking by the time you're done?"

Zhu Lian retorted, "What’s it to you? Just go eat shit. You won’t have to spend any money, and if you’re still hungry afterward, just tell me. When we get back to the inn, wait for me outside the toilet, and I’ll make sure it’s hot and fresh."

Pei Qian shot back with a glare, "That’s disgusting."

Ignoring the ongoing banter between the two, Chen Ping'an inquired for directions and headed toward the now infamous temple in the capital.

After about half an hour of walking, they neared the temple, where only a sparse number of people lingered outside the walls. Some shouted insults and threw stones before fleeing, while many others had come simply to gawk. Those who showed up were likely individuals whose forebears had suffered at the hands of the Daze Gang, and thus they dared not curse openly, much less attack a drowning dog, considering that Zhu Fengxian’s life was still in jeopardy. However, several notorious disciples remained at the temple, and even one of them alone would be enough to instill fear in the average martial artist of the Qingluan Kingdom.

The temple was small and closed to visitors today. Chen Ping'an knocked on a side door for quite some time before a cautious Taoist priest answered. He looked wary as Chen Ping'an mentioned he was an acquaintance of Zhu Fengxian and requested that the temple notify him of his visit.

The young priest nodded and asked Chen Ping'an to wait a moment. After closing the door, about half a stick of incense later, apart from the priest who had gone to deliver the message, another disciple—one who had accompanied Zhu Fengxian during the previous visit—recognized Chen Ping'an and sighed in relief, leading him to the back of the temple.

This disciple didn’t speak much along the way, only offering polite thanks for Chen Ping'an remembering the bonds of Jianghu.

As they approached a house, a strong medicinal odor wafted out. Several of Zhu Fengxian’s disciples stood solemnly outside the door, their expressions grave. Upon seeing Chen Ping'an, they merely nodded in acknowledgment, remaining tense and vigilant. After all, their previous encounter at Jin Gui Temple had only been a brief intersection; the motivations of this outsider surnamed Chen were unknown to them. If it weren’t for Zhu Fengxian specifically requesting Chen Ping'an’s presence while bedridden, no one would have dared to open the door for him.

Chen Ping'an instructed Zhu Lian and the others to wait around the corner of the hallway, ensuring they didn’t approach the room.

When one of Zhu Fengxian's direct disciples opened the door, Chen Ping'an, with his sword slung over his shoulder and carrying a bamboo box, stepped inside alone.

Zhu Fengxian was propped up on pillows, his face pale and covered with a blanket. He smiled weakly, "After our parting on the mountain, to meet again in a foreign land, here I am, Zhu Fengxian, in such a pitiful state. I must be making you laugh, Young Master Chen."

He was gravely injured.

Aside from the bedridden Zhu Fengxian, there was an elderly Taoist who appeared somewhat dull. After the disciple who had helped open the door closed it behind them, he moved a chair for Chen Ping'an and then stood silently to the side, remaining present in case Chen Ping'an suddenly turned violent.

Chen Ping'an set the bamboo box down by his feet, took a seat, and softly asked, "Old Master, did you come to the capital without hiding your whereabouts?"

Zhu Fengxian coughed a few times, forcing a smile. "Of course I tried to conceal my presence, but the court has sharp ears and eyes, and I couldn’t manage it well. This temple in the capital is a branch that the Daze Gang has painstakingly established over the past thirty years. It may have already been on the court’s radar. That’s nothing though. Our Qingluan Kingdom’s Emperor Tang has always had a fascination with the Jianghu, and since ascending the throne, he has treated it relatively kindly. Most grievances and vendettas, as long as they don’t go too far, the authorities tend not to interfere.

"In fact, back when I roamed the martial world, sweeping through several nations, the prince Tang Li, who was still a dragon hidden in the den at that time, apparently admired me greatly and vowed that one day he would personally summon me, the martial artist who brought honor to Qingluan."

Chen Ping'an noticed that Zhu Fengxian was struggling to speak, so he decided to refrain from further inquiries and bent down to open the bamboo box.

Upon making this motion, the old Taoist and the man in the room braced themselves, ready for action. Chen Ping'an halted, explaining, "I have a few bottles of pills I refined on the mountain. They won’t bring someone back from the dead or swiftly heal severe injuries, but they should help replenish Qi and nourish the spirit. They can aid in patching up a martial artist's body."

Zhu Fengxian attempted to raise his arm but lacked the strength, so he merely shook it gently while smiling at his two confidants. "You don’t need to be so tense. My ability to discern people is better than my martial skills. In this capital, anyone might come to pick up the scraps, but Young Master Chen is certainly not one of them."

On his way there, Chen Ping'an had chosen a quiet back alley and discreetly retrieved three bottles of pills from his belongings, placing them into the bamboo box to avoid drawing attention.

After taking out the three porcelain bottles, he extended them to the elderly Taoist, stating, "Please, Elder, check the efficacy of these pills to see if they are suitable for the old master’s recovery."

Zhu Fengxian couldn’t help but chuckle. "Young Master Chen, your kind intention to send medicine for saving lives is indeed unique in how much you’ve downplayed it."

The old Taoist accepted the three porcelain bottles, still expressionless, and moved to the table, pouring out a pill from each and meticulously crushing them with a silver needle.

Rather than feeling offended by the old Taoist’s actions, Chen Ping'an found it fitting; this was how Jianghu people ought to conduct their affairs.

Though Zhu Fengxian was in poor health, he was in good spirits. Ignoring the signals from his disciples that it was time to dismiss their guest, Zhu Fengxian smiled and asked, "Young Master Chen, do you think that Charming Pig is really the culprit?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I’ve never met her, so I can’t say for sure what her true nature is. Generally speaking, that concubine from the Qing Shan Kingdom wouldn’t be foolish enough to kill multiple people in a foreign capital using such a distinctive method. However, if this is merely a smokescreen to divert suspicion from herself, it’s unlikely but still possible. Ultimately, it could be a power struggle between the two kingdoms; whether it was Yuan Ye who committed the murders might not even be the main point. Thus, old master, this confrontation you’re embroiled in seems unworthy, yet the mastermind behind the scenes who plotted against you is quite clever. You must take great care in leaving the capital."

Zhu Fengxian nodded. "That is indeed the case."

The old Taoist, who had been focused on assessing the pills, couldn’t help but raise his head, glancing at the young man dressed in white with a sword on his back.

Chen Ping'an chatted with Zhu Fengxian for a bit longer before rising to take his leave.

Zhu Fengxian couldn’t get out of bed and could only awkwardly clasp his fists in farewell. However, this action exacerbated his injuries, leading to a fit of coughing.

As Chen Ping'an and his companions left the temple and returned to the inn, the disciple who had escorted them out hesitated before speaking.

Zhu Fengxian chuckled. "What, are you still hoping for Chen Ping'an to help us leave the capital?"

The disciple replied honestly, "If he is willing to assist, it would certainly be a good thing. Since he came here, it shows he is inclined towards our Daze Gang. If we could persuade him a bit, who knows..."

Zhu Fengxian let out a scoff, cutting off the disciple’s naive hopes. "Fool, greed knows no bounds. Didn’t you catch the underlying message when Chen Ping'an warned us to be careful leaving the city? He’s already clarified his stance. Bringing medicine is merely a gesture of Jianghu camaraderie from our previous encounter. Once he delivers the medicine, he’ll consider his duty fulfilled. You don’t understand this basic principle? Don’t mistake his kindness for foolishness."

The disciple knew the convolutions of the situation, bowing his head. "The current circumstances are indeed perilous."

Zhu Fengxian sighed. "Fortunately, you held back and didn’t complicate matters. Otherwise, if it were Zhu Ziyang at the Golden Summit Temple facing trouble, and Chen Ping'an happened to be there again, do you think he would come to her aid?"

The disciple stayed silent.

He understood the reasoning, but the precarious situation Zhu Fengxian and the Daze Gang found themselves in might not be something they could escape. The road from the temple to the capital’s gates, and then onward to the Daze Gang, could very well lead to the underworld at any point.

Zhu Fengxian laughed lightly. "Well, in the Jianghu, life and death are one's own responsibility. Is it only allowed for others to die in my Zhu Fengxian's hands? Is this Jianghu solely mine, the backyard pond of our Daze Gang?"

The disciple smiled faintly. "Back in our Qingluan Kingdom, it indeed seemed that way three or four decades ago."

Zhu Fengxian closed his eyes.

The old Taoist spoke up. "The pills are fine, of high quality, and are bound to be valuable. They will aid in your recovery from injuries. This isn’t just embellishment but rather something genuinely beneficial in your time of need."

The disciple beamed with joy. "Really?"

The old Taoist shot him a sidelong glance. "Don’t believe me?"

The disciple grinned. "Of course not."

This old Taoist was the strategist who had diligently served the Daze Gang for decades, and Zhu Ziyang’s early path into cultivation was also thanks to the old man’s keen insight.

Suddenly, Zhu Fengxian opened his eyes, instructing the disciple to leave the room. Once the door was closed, he slowly said, "Now, tell me, after helping me for so many years, and then pulling this stunt on me, what exactly are you trying to achieve? Regardless of the outcome, I won’t hold it against you. I just hope you and the mastermind behind this can look after Ziyang in the future and keep her out of this mess while she focuses on her training on the mountain."

The old Taoist stood up and sat in the chair Chen Ping'an had just vacated, dodging the question. "Old Zhu, I think Young Master Chen, despite his youth, carries a heavy Jianghu aura."

The old Taoist sighed. "It seems that we old Jianghu folks are becoming less and less capable. Nowadays, the younger generations, in their rush to ascend, don’t hesitate to strike down their masters, disregarding all tradition and principles."

Zhu Fengxian turned his head and smiled. "How old are you anyway? You still look the same as when I first met you. Has it really been nearly sixty years?"

The old Taoist pondered for a moment. "Half my life has been spent wandering in my hometown, and half in your Qingluan Kingdom."

Seeing his old friend unwilling to elaborate, Zhu Fengxian decided not to press further; it was pointless.

The noble youths of the capital had provoked trouble in the temples, leading to Charming Sparrow’s intervention, which resulted in several deaths that night. The citizens were in a state of panic, united in their anger, while the influential families from the Southern region were outraged, further escalating tensions between the Qingluan Kingdom and the Qing Shan Kingdom. Charming Pig had named Zhu Fengxian as a fellow martial arts master. With Zhu Fengxian gravely injured and defeated, nobody from the inn bothered to kneel in apology. Yuan Ye brazenly mocked the scholarly integrity of the Qingluan intelligentsia, causing an uproar in the capital, overshadowing the debate between Buddhism and Taoism. Many Southern families contacted the local nobility, pressing the Qingluan Kingdom’s Emperor Tang Li for action, while Emperor He Kui prepared to leave the capital with his four concubines, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among the martial artists of the Qingluan Kingdom.

In just a few short days, a storm was brewing.

Everything was interconnected.

As Chen Ping'an and his companions were about to leave the capital.

At the outskirts of the capital, in the Lion Garden, a carriage rolled along a small path under the night sky.

The driver, in reality, a disguised elder who was the foremost of the four masters, was tall and had just stealthily entered the Qingluan Kingdom from Yunxiao Kingdom. In terms of martial prowess, he was a master far surpassing the likes of Charming Pig Yuan Ye and Zhu Fengxian.

Liu Qingfeng, after reading a report from the Green Wave Pavilion, said, "We can stop now."

Sitting across from him, a handsome young man smiled. "So soon? I was planning to use this as an opportunity to meet someone, but it seems there’s no bite."

Liu Qingfeng’s expression remained neutral. "It’s enough."

As the carriage approached the Lion Garden, Li Baozhen suddenly said with a grin, "I won’t go into the garden. I’ll wait in the carriage while you finish your business with the old minister, and then we’ll head back to the county office together."

Liu Qingfeng stepped down from the carriage and walked alone into the Lion Garden under the cover of night.

Li Baozhen remained in the carriage, sitting behind the driver. This young man, like Chen Ping'an, also hailed from the ancient Li Zhu Cave, idly swinging his legs and smiling, "Just thinking about how my precious younger sister calls Chen Ping'an 'Little Master Uncle' makes me furious. What am I supposed to do? As her older brother, I can’t bear to say a harsh word to my little treasure, so I’ll have to tease that mud-footed boy from the Mud Bottle Alley. If it weren’t for the fact that I had to escort little Baoping, Yuan Ye and Zhu Fengxian wouldn’t have ended up in this bloodbath. But what I admire most about the national master is his understanding of human nature and ability to place pieces in others' yards. Everyone does this to some extent; back in our Dali Kingdom’s capital, even in the Changchun Palace, and even around Song Changjing, there are many such instances. Even our emperor has his fair share of schemers from the various schools of thought. Yet in the end, when the dust settles, it seems like every small loss adds up to great gains for our national master, which is rather frightening."

Li Baozhen rambled on for a while before asking the driver with a smile, "Your background is such that even I can’t easily look up, can you tell me why you’re willing to serve our Dali Kingdom?"

The old driver, calm as ever, replied, "I hope you don’t trip up on your path to office, or else I’ll be the first to take you down."

Li Baozhen brushed it off. "You should really change that habit of yours to speak your mind to everyone. It’s bad manners. Wait until the day you can take me down before you say such things."

The old driver sneered. "Fine, I’ll repeat it then."

After a moment of silence.

Liu Qingfeng had yet to return.

Li Baozhen casually asked, "Is Jianghu fun?"

The driver replied in a low voice, "Not fun. It’s easy to get killed."

Li Baozhen responded with a soft "Oh," "I see. Well, I’ll take it easy then. I’m new here, so I’ll take some time to get familiar with the local customs. I’ve never been particularly brave; there are many formidable figures back in my hometown. Just walking down the street, I’m afraid of disturbing the local gods or martial arts masters."

Li Baozhen lightly tapped his knees. "They say old friends meet old friends with tearful eyes. I wonder who will cry next time I meet that Chen fellow. Sigh, that silly girl Zhu Lu found me in the capital and cried her heart out. I almost felt sorry for her. I was so heartbroken that I nearly slapped her to death. How could she mess up something so trivial? It caused me to incur the queen's wrath and ruined my prospects in Dali's officialdom. Otherwise, I wouldn’t need to come to this shabby place and claw my way up step by step."

The old driver chuckled. "You little brat, when you fall on hard times, it’ll be particularly painful."

Li Baozhen sighed. "Look at you, speaking your mind again. How come you never listen to advice? That’s not good."

The night was deepening.

Li Baozhen gazed toward the Lion Garden and chuckled, "Our Liu sir here is far worse off than I am. I’m just filled with malice while he’s burdened with sorrow, with countless people cursing him."

————

In a small post inn on the outskirts of the Qingluan Kingdom.

The atmosphere was extremely tense.

In this small inn, hidden dragons and crouching tigers lay in wait.

In one room.

Two pairs of eyes locked onto each other.

A white-robed youth pointed an accusing finger at the green-clad old man, furiously shouting, "You old bastard! We agreed to a fair gamble, no underhanded tricks! You actually threw Li Baozhen into the Qingluan Kingdom at this critical juncture. Given this guy's temperament, do you think he won't take revenge on personal grievances? Don’t you have any shame?!"

The old man in green remained expressionless, responding calmly, "You little brat, secretly sending a message to Chen Ping'an to block the road to the Lion Garden—aren't you the one losing face?"

The handsome youth with a beauty mark in the middle of his forehead continued to curse, "You old fool, you’re the one breaking the rules! You plotted against Chen Ping'an, undermining the very foundation of my path, and you expect me not to retaliate?!"

Inside the room, there were only two people.

It was Cui Dongshan.

And the embroidered tiger, Cui Zhan.

In reality, they were one and the same.

Cui Zhan remained indifferent, wiping the spittle off his face. "Is it entertaining to insult yourself?"

Cui Dongshan grinned widely. "It feels great!"

Cui Zhan scoffed. "Seeing you in this pathetic state makes me understand why we were stuck at the pinnacle of the twelfth realm all those years ago."

Cui Dongshan plopped down in a chair. "If I had known you’d turn out to be such a useless wretch, I would have just killed myself back then."

Cui Zhan smiled. "You can still die now if you want, just remember to leave behind this useless shell and your belongings."

Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes, spreading his arms out as he slumped over the table, his face pressed against the surface, grumbling, "The emperor is dead? Soon, Song Changjing will be acting as regent?"

Cui Zhan nodded.

Cui Dongshan didn’t look up. "So who will be the new emperor? Will it still be those two candidates, each taking half?"

Cui Zhan pretended not to hear.

Cui Dongshan raised his head, shifting from slumped over to leaning back in his chair. "How boring."

Cui Zhan remarked, "I see you’re quite spirited as a disciple to someone else."

Cui Dongshan continued to roll his eyes.

Finding some amusement in the situation?

Cui Zhan couldn't help but wonder if he had been like this when he was younger.

Cui Dongshan hesitated before asking, "How’s the old man doing in the Bamboo Loft at the Falling Ruins Mountain?"

Cui Zhan remained silent for a long while before answering, "He’s completely severed his path to the eleventh realm, but his mindset is still decent."

Cui Dongshan crossed his legs in his chair and asked, "If Chen Ping'an killed Li Baozhen, what would you do?"

Cui Zhan shook his head. "Chen Ping'an once promised Li Xisheng that he would spare Li Baozhen once. After that, life and death are up to him."

Cui Dongshan suddenly sat up, staring blankly at Cui Zhan.

Cui Zhan replied calmly, "Yes, it was all part of my plan. Right now, Li Baozhen is too inexperienced; if he’s to be of great use in the future, he must first face hardships."

Cui Dongshan burst into laughter, jumping off the chair to massage Cui Zhan's shoulders, grinning, "Old Cui, you’re still one of us! I misjudged you this time; don’t be angry, just cool off."

Cui Zhan remained unmoved. "Had I known it would end up like this, we should have just killed ourselves back then."

Cui Dongshan playfully slapped Cui Zhan's head. "Stop with the morbid talk! Ugh, we should strive to survive for a thousand years, regardless of our different paths."

Cui Zhan replied, "If you spit on my head again, don’t expect to live that long."

————

On the small path of the reeds leading from the Lion Garden to the official road.

A carriage gradually came to a stop, the old driver looking tense. Li Baozhen lifted the carriage curtain and, upon seeing the person, had an expression of disbelief. *This is possible? It’s truly a case of old acquaintances meeting!*### Chapter 399: The Least Feared Thing in the World

When Li Baozhen saw the young man who absolutely should not have appeared on the road, his thoughts raced.

Could it be that Liu Qingfeng behind him sought to frame him, wishing to monopolize the undercurrents of power in the Qingluan Kingdom? That shouldn't be the case. The National Master wouldn’t allow Liu Qingfeng’s family to dominate unchecked; it would only make sense for him to balance the powers of both Liu Qingfeng and himself.

Was it just a coincidence, a sudden encounter on this night?

With a sigh, Li Baozhen thought that if his luck was this poor, he would prefer it to be someone plotting against him. After all, in a battle of wits, one could rely on strategy; but if it was merely bad fortune, should he start burning incense and praying?

Li Baozhen stood behind the old coachman and whispered, “What do you mean?”

The old coachman replied solemnly, “One of this man’s attendants, a hunchbacked old man, is likely a martial artist from the Far Travel Realm, not weaker than I am.”

Li Baozhen slapped his forehead. “The intelligence has misled me.”

According to recent reports, Chen Pingan was at the Baohua Pavilion Inn in the capital city, having left with three of his four master attendants, only taking two with him. One was named Zhu Lian, his strength unknown but possibly at the Golden Body Realm, while the other had exhibited peculiar behavior during the Lion Garden incident and seemed weaker than Zhu Lian. As for Chen Pingan himself, judging by his punching level at the Lion Garden, he had at least the cultivation of a fifth realm pure martial artist. He could draw talismans and wore a celestial robe of indeterminate rank, with a gourd hanging by his side, presumably the “Ginger Gourd” used to nurture flying swords. Whether it contained any flying swords was still unknown.

Piecing together the fragmented intelligence still didn’t reveal Chen Pingan’s true strength.

But that wasn’t important. Li Baozhen concluded that even if Chen Pingan had suddenly transformed into a terrestrial immortal overnight, it had nothing to do with him, Li Baozhen.

Li Baozhen was merely using the great influence of the Dali Dynasty as a chessboard, toying with the piece that was Chen Pingan within the game.

The intelligence regarding the Green Wave Pavilion in the southeastern territory of Baopingzhou shifted quietly, like pieces on an ever-stretching spider web.

Before leaving Dali, the National Master Cui Chan had given Li Baozhen three choices: to go to the Great Sui and keep an eye on the Gao royal family and the Huangting Kingdom among the old vassals; to the Zhu Ying Dynasty, the greatest obstacle in front of the Dali cavalry, which had many sword cultivators, also a top priority; and lastly, to the Qingluan Kingdom, which, compared to the first two, was merely a backwater, remote place. It was only in the last two years that the Green Wave Pavilion began investing heavily here, as the educated class gradually migrated southward. Of course, these were merely the surface phenomena Li Baozhen observed after taking office. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be able to access the old coachman’s profile. But Li Baozhen wasn’t foolish; the aristocracy had an elder from Qingluan Kingdom, Tang Chong, and the rivers and lakes had figures like Zhu Fengxian of the Great Ze Gang. Especially with National Master Cui Chan personally present here, even breaking protocol to meet Liu Qingfeng from the Lion Garden... All of this indicated that Li Baozhen’s foresight wasn’t lacking. Choosing this place as his “dragon’s rising ground” in the Dali court, temporarily distancing himself from the whirlpool of danger surrounding the Song family, was undoubtedly a correct gamble.

Li Baozhen felt a bit irritated. If he had waited a few more days until a significant figure responsible for protecting him entered Qingluan Kingdom, it would have been a situation where he had nothing to fear. Names like Grand Commander Wei Liang or the chief offering of the Tang clan, Zhou Lingzhi, wouldn’t even be worth mentioning.

How could this mud bottle alley bumpkin choose the time and place so well?

Li Baozhen turned and bent down, lifting the curtain to smile and ask, “Mr. Liu, do you have a backup plan?”

Liu Qingfeng shook his head and smiled. “Like you, I have to wait a few days for a Dali martial secretary to act as my personal attendant.”

Li Baozhen grimaced. “Mr. Liu, can you bear to watch your ally die before even achieving success?”

Liu Qingfeng pondered for a moment and replied, “You must trust National Master Cui’s calculations.”

Li Baozhen sighed and lowered the curtain. It seemed this night, whether it brought fortune or disaster, was unavoidable.

It wasn’t that Li Baozhen didn’t believe in that embroidered tiger’s chess skills; it was just that the National Master might not genuinely regard him, this fence-sitter, as significant. Li Baozhen firmly believed that if Cui Chan had to choose between him and Liu Qingfeng, he would, without hesitation, leave Liu Qingfeng on the board and flick Li Baozhen back into the jar of pieces to settle the matter. After all, weren’t those fragments that made up his hometown’s Shattered Porcelain Mountain merely light-weight, pitiful discarded pieces that had turned to dust in the great struggle for the Dao?

Li Baozhen had long enjoyed being alone, often climbing to the top of the Porcelain Mountain, feeling as if he were stepping on countless white bones to reach the summit, which felt quite good.

Chen Pingan had Stone Rou protect Pei Qian from a distance, continuing forward only with Zhu Lian.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan sent him a secret letter, stating that Li Baozhen had appeared in the Lion Garden, ending with the terse words: “Killable.”

Without any doubt or hesitation, Chen Pingan quickly left the capital city, heading straight for the Lion Garden.

In matters not directly involving the great Dao, Chen Pingan chose to trust Cui Dongshan, such as when he selected the dry-boned female ghost, Stone Rou, to occupy Du Mao’s remnant position, and now this.

Approaching within fifty paces of the carriage, Chen Pingan walked slowly, already able to see clearly the young gentleman standing behind the coachman.

It was this person, with Zhu Lu’s admiration and youthful affection, who had dangled the bait of helping a father and daughter escape from their lowly status and gain the title of lady, prompting Zhu Lu to approach Chen Pingan with a bright smile in that corridor, hands clasped behind her back, all the while concealing her killing intent.

That was the first time Chen Pingan had left the Lizhu Cave Heaven, and it felt far more dangerous than the life-and-death confrontation with the Mountain Moving Old Ape at the small town.

“Chen Pingan, this is our first meeting, isn’t it?”

Li Baozhen, standing behind the old coachman, greeted him with a smile. “I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Li Baozhen, brother of Li Xisheng and elder brother of Li Baoping.”

Chen Pingan halted, asking, “If you die here tonight, will you regret it?”

Li Baozhen nodded. “I would definitely regret it.”

Chen Pingan smiled. “Is it regret for not being careful enough?”

Li Baozhen, as if throwing caution to the wind, replied candidly, “Yes, once I left Longquan County’s Fulu Street and our Dali Dynasty, I thought I could soar freely; it was too unwise. Chen Pingan, you’ve taught me two valuable lessons on how to be a person and do things. Things shouldn’t repeat thrice; from now on, you walk your sunny path, and I’ll walk my narrow bridge. How does that sound?”

Zhu Lian raised his arm, rubbing his palms together, eagerly saying, “That old driver, though a martial artist from the Far Travel Realm, I can handle him completely. Young Master, at least we’re of the same realm. If I accidentally go too far and can’t hold back, don’t take it personally.”

The old coachman’s eyes burned with intensity, fixated on the hunchbacked old man. The three kingdoms of Qingluan, Qingshan, and Yunxiao, along with the surrounding small nations, had shallow waters in the rivers and lakes, and with his duty, he couldn’t wander too far, wasting his title as a pure martial artist of the eighth realm. It was a rare chance to encounter one tonight, and he couldn’t miss it. However, with Li Baozhen behind him and Mr. Liu in the carriage, he felt somewhat constrained, asking, “Dealing with this attendant is tough, my lord. Do you have any brilliant plans to spare me? One that can protect you and let me have a good fight?”

Li Baozhen smiled wryly. “I never expected this situation. My brilliant plans only harm others and don’t save myself.”

The coachman stood up, scoffing, “So you have nothing? After all the scheming, it turns out you have so little to show for it.”

Li Baozhen laughed, “Then I’ll trouble you tonight to give a bit more effort and win me a chance to salvage the situation.”

As the number one martial artist in Baopingzhou, the coachman naturally had a heavy burden. He wouldn’t let his disdain for Li Baozhen lead him to throw in the towel and abandon the task.

The carriage shook slightly, and Li Baozhen felt a gust of wind on his face as the old coachman had already leaped forward, rushing straight at Chen Pingan.

The reeds on both sides of the path swayed toward Chen Pingan and Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian habitually hunched forward a few steps, his figure as fast as lightning, as he extended a palm.

He intercepted the old coachman’s powerful punch, which had surged with energy and expanded the sleeves.

Zhu Lian slid backward, just managing to stand shoulder to shoulder with Chen Pingan, while the old coachman used his momentum to drift back to the ground.

The reeds on either side of the road rustled and swayed, making a sharp sound in the otherwise silent night.

Li Baozhen saw the scattered streams of punch energy swirling around until they reached the utterly still Chen Pingan, like a fine drizzle meeting an oiled paper umbrella, not a drop touching the umbrella holder.

Li Baozhen’s eyelids twitched. So this was a fellow at the minimum realm of five in martial arts.

This mud bottle alley punk appeared to be doing quite well after leaving the Lizhu Cave Heaven.

Li Baozhen felt a bit regretful. Should he have chosen the path of cultivation back then? A pure martial artist at the peak of the fifth realm before eighteen, in a world where martial artists abound in the Dali Dynasty, surely he could be called a genius, right? Could it be that the immense martial fortune after the collapse of the Lizhu Cave Heaven had been monopolized by this fellow? No, that wasn’t right; the vassal king Song Changjing, Li Er, and Zheng Dafeng had divided it among themselves, leaving only scraps.

Zhu Lian shook his wrist and smiled. “Hey, big brother, your punch is a bit soft. Why are you being polite to me? Afraid you’ll kill me with one punch and lose your fun? No need, just hit me as hard as you can; I’m tough and can take a beating. If you keep holding back, I won’t go easy on you!”

Just then, Zhu Lian sprang forth like a wild monkey, moving with the speed of a lightning bolt, arriving before the old coachman in an instant, returning the favor with a single punch.

Li Baozhen had limited vision, only seeing Zhu Lian’s punch, followed by the two facing off, and found himself dizzy from the rapid exchanges.

Before long, Li Baozhen felt his ears ringing, swallowed hard, and felt slightly better.

With a light shout, the old coachman used both hands to bind and strike, throwing Zhu Lian into the reeds, while he himself stepped back, heavily stomping the ground, lifting one foot gently to steady himself.

If not for the concern over Li Baozhen behind him, the old coachman would have been able to punch more freely.

Zhu Lian’s body extended in the air, balancing on a slender reed, swaying left and right a few times, smiling, “Big brother, it seems you haven’t had a smooth time in these many years at the eighth realm; the path to greatness is a climb, isn’t it?”

The old coachman sneered, “Isn’t it too early to say that?”

Zhu Lian walked atop the clusters of reeds, skimming the surface lightly, producing a series of sounds like popping beans. He chuckled, “Not too early at all. I’m just worried that if we really get into a life-or-death match, you won’t leave any last words behind. I’ve heard that eighth realm martial artists are quite rare in the world; if you die so suddenly, I would be saddened for the loss of such a talent. While my young master hasn’t found you unsightly yet, I’d better have a chat while I can.”

The old coachman fell silent.

Inside the carriage, Liu Qingfeng attempted to rise.

Chen Pingan’s gourd suddenly emitted a flash of white light, swiftly drawing an arc, seamlessly penetrating the carriage wall, and hovering at Liu Qingfeng’s brow.

Liu Qingfeng smiled and sat back down.

Li Baozhen, with one hand hidden in his sleeve, had just made a move when a flash of dark green sword light shot out, piercing through his sleeve and nailing a talisman to the carriage wall behind him.

That golden talisman was quite peculiar, written with alchemical symbols on both sides. Not only that, but each side depicted a divine general in black and white armor.

It was a talisman of the long-lost True Body of the Day and Night Traveling Deities from the Hao Ran realm.

Li Baozhen sighed and said to the old coachman, “Let’s call it a night. There’s no need to continue fighting. I, Li Baozhen, will just wait to die.”

Zhu Lian hurriedly said, “No, big brother, we can fight without it affecting my young master’s important business with your lord.”

The old coachman nodded and dashed toward Zhu Lian.

Chen Pingan approached the carriage, Li Baozhen sat inside, presenting himself as ready for slaughter.

However, Chen Pingan gazed toward the carriage curtain, “I initially thought it was like the saying of a noble family, watching over its doors. Turns out it’s another saying from the same text.”

Inside the carriage, Liu Qingfeng remarked, “Fortune and misfortune come without doors; one only brings them upon oneself?”

Chen Pingan ceased to speak.

Great truths and lesser truths are something that scholars often understand.

Especially someone like Liu Qingfeng, who grew up steeped in literature and had experience in official circles.

The rivers and lakes’ bravado, such as the likes of Zhu Fengxian, made it easier for the onlookers to see through.

Life and death, honor and disgrace, straightforward and direct.

Li Baozhen looked at Chen Pingan.

He sat, while Chen Pingan stood, and the two locked gazes.

Curiously, Li Baozhen asked, “No matter how you found me, after you kill me tonight, how will you return to Dali? Do you plan to give up your ancestral home in Longquan County?”

Chen Pingan regarded this Li family descendant from Fulu Street, who wanted him dead, yet was still somewhat of a family.

How could they be so different in nature from Li Xisheng and little Baoping?

Seeing that Chen Pingan did not respond, Li Baozhen smiled, “I’m just a scholar, unable to withstand your punch. It’s quite a twist of fate; how could things change so quickly in just a few years? Had I known you would change so much, I should have roped in Zhu He along with you, so I wouldn’t have had to leave my home, let alone die in a foreign land.”

With a punch.

Li Baozhen cradled his abdomen, curling up, nearly retching his bile.

Chen Pingan had only used the strength of a second realm martial artist for that punch.

Chen Pingan reached out, grabbed Li Baozhen’s topknot, and yanked him down from the carriage, tossing him onto the muddy road, where he rolled away. Finally, he lay sprawled on the ground, arms and legs spread out, tears streaming down his face—not from sorrow or regret, but from pure physical pain. Li Baozhen laughed, “I never imagined I, Li Baozhen, would have such a day. Liu Qingfeng, remember to help me collect my corpse and send it back to Longquan County in Dali!”

Chen Pingan squatted down.

Li Baozhen met his gaze.

He saw a pair of familiar yet foreign eyes.

This gaze was unlike the depthless abyss of National Master Cui Chan; Li Baozhen was fortunate not to see the bottom, or else he would probably be a corpse by now. After all, those who peer into the abyss attract misfortune, and he was still far from qualified to glimpse into the thoughts of that embroidered tiger.

But the current gaze of Chen Pingan shared one similarity with the Dali National Master that Li Baozhen vividly remembered.

In the depths of an abyss and at the bottom of an ancient well, both harbored lurking evil creatures eager to raise their heads.

Suddenly, a sense of pleasure filled Li Baozhen’s eyes as he softly said, “Chen Pingan, I await the day you become someone like me. I look forward to that day.”

Chen Pingan scooped up a handful of dirt from the ground, using his palm to lightly tap on Li Baozhen’s throat. As Li Baozhen involuntarily opened his mouth, he stuffed the dirt inside, then covered Li Baozhen’s mouth with his palm and asked, “How does it taste?”

Li Baozhen struggled, his face turning red.

Chen Pingan slightly turned his head, “What did you say? I didn’t hear you. Speak louder.”

Li Baozhen suddenly stopped struggling and gradually swallowed a mouthful of dirt, his eyes fixed on the indifferent young face.

Chen Pingan raised his hand, and Li Baozhen’s face twisted as he mumbled, “Not bad!”

Chen Pingan nodded. “It’s hard to eat shit now; what’s so difficult about eating dirt?”

Following the earlier pattern, after Li Baozhen swallowed a large handful of dirt, Chen Pingan again covered his mouth, this time with increased pressure, causing Li Baozhen’s head to sink slightly into the mud.

After Chen Pingan released him, Li Baozhen gasped, struggling to breathe, then began to cough violently, spitting out a great deal of dirt.

Chen Pingan raised his right hand, gently waving his sleeve to brush away the dirt splattered on him.

At that moment, Li Baozhen let out a wail.

Chen Pingan’s left hand gripped Li Baozhen’s left hand, causing it to crack audibly, as Li Baozhen’s hand, which had stealthily clenched into a fist, opened to reveal a jade pendant he had secretly snatched from his waist.

The piece of jade, with the ancient words “Dragon Palace” engraved upon it, was originally unremarkable, but now it shimmered with a translucent quality, and within it, a slender thread of light swiftly circulated.

After crushing Li Baozhen’s wrist bone, Chen Pingan held the jade plate, which was on the verge of activating a technique, tightly in his palm, saying, “Thanks for that.”

The flying swords returned from both Liu Qingfeng’s brow and the outer carriage wall, along with the rare talisman that Chen Pingan had seen through at a glance, were collected into his spatial item.

In that book, *Dan Shu Zhen Ji*, this day-and-night traveling deity talisman was recorded in detail on the third-to-last page.

Li Baozhen covered his left wrist with his right hand, smiling sadly, “You’re ruthless. I’m scared of you now.”

These two items, the Dragon Palace jade pendant, were one of the Li family’s ancestral life-saving charms, while that talisman was a parting gift from his elder brother, Li Xisheng.

The most crucial part was that these two priceless celestial artifacts could only be explored by outsiders after he, Li Baozhen, personally “opened the door.” Otherwise, below the fifth realm cultivators, even if you were an earth immortal, they would be worthless dead objects.

Chen Pingan kicked Li Baozhen in the ribs, sending him sprawling into the reeds, landing in the lake.

Injury would take a hundred days to heal.

Liu Qingfeng stepped out of the carriage, jumping down, “Regardless of the reasons, I still have to thank Young Master Chen for your mercy in not killing Li Baozhen.”

Chen Pingan asked, “What about the Lion Garden? What about Liu Qingshan?”

Liu Qingfeng replied, “I’ve already arranged a retreat for them.”

Chen Pingan looked somewhat weary; he didn’t want to say much to this old minister’s eldest son. However, thinking of that limping young scholar, he asked, “I believe you want a favorable outcome, but you, Liu Qingfeng, should know better than anyone that you are now on a different path. How can you guarantee you won’t stray further from the result you desire?”

Liu Qingfeng smiled bitterly, gazing into the distance, and sighed, “We can only walk and see. Otherwise, in our Qingluan Kingdom, from His Majesty the Emperor to the scholars, and down to the rural commoners, everyone’s backbone will soon be broken by others, and then we won’t even have a path left to walk. Everyone knows that drinking poison to quench thirst is bad, but if one is truly thirsty to death, who wouldn’t drink? It’s just like in the Lion Garden shrine, that Liu Shu Niang, whom I dislike so much, urged my father to get you involved. If I were merely a piece in this game, I wouldn’t be able to stand up like Liu Qingshan and uphold the Liu family’s integrity. But I, Liu Qingfeng, after weighing the pros and cons, would only end up betraying my heart.”

Liu Qingfeng withdrew his gaze and smiled, “Fortunately, things haven’t reached the worst point. Every family has its difficulties, and as the elder brother, it’s my duty to bear that burden. The easy parts, let my弟弟 handle them.”

Chen Pingan glanced toward the direction where Li Baozhen fell into the water. “You’re still much better than this fellow.”

Chen Pingan looked toward the fighting scene in the distance and shouted, “Let’s head back.”

Chen Pingan then said to Liu Qingfeng, “You can rescue him now.”

Liu Qingfeng asked, “Why not just kill Li Baozhen?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “I promised someone before that I would spare Li Baozhen once.”

Zhu Lian rushed over, full of regret, wiping the blood from his face. Just as he got warmed up, it was time for that old coachman to become weak and wish for bliss.

But seeing that Chen Pingan remained silent, Zhu Lian didn’t make any jokes and silently followed.

Suddenly, Liu Qingfeng said to Chen Pingan’s back, “Young Master Chen, it’s best not to stay near the capital waiting for opportunities, thinking you can keep your promise while meeting Li Baozhen again.”

Chen Pingan turned his head, smiling and asking, “Why’s that?”

Liu Qingfeng shook his head with a smile, not revealing more.

The Dali Dynasty was about to send two people to serve as attendants to both Liu Qingfeng and Li Baozhen. It was said that one of them was a pillar on the battlefield from the old Lu Dynasty.

But that wasn’t the most important part; the real danger lay in the possibility that National Master Cui Chan was still in Qingluan Kingdom.

As Chen Pingan and his group left the scene.

The old coachman rescued the barely conscious Li Baozhen, gently helping him expel a belly full of water.

Li Baozhen took a long time to regain his senses, sitting on the road with a dazed expression.

The old coachman stood beside him, turning to Liu Qingfeng.

Liu Qingfeng smiled and shook his head.

Thus, Li Baozhen once again danced on the threshold of death.

Li Baozhen had his back to the two exchanging glances, but this young gentleman, utterly embarrassed tonight, slapped his face a few times, then turned to smile, “It seems Mr. Liu still cares a lot about the National Master’s opinion.”

Liu Qingfeng squatted down, smiling, “If someone else came to Qingluan Kingdom, they might not do better than you.”

Li Baozhen pretended to burp, “Eating dirt and drinking water is a bit too much. The rivers and lakes are truly deep and can easily claim lives; I almost drowned at the bottom.”

Liu Qingfeng helped Li Baozhen to his feet, “It seems we need to return to the Lion Garden first to get you changed.”

Li Baozhen tilted his head, bouncing a few times to shake the water out of his ears, smiling brightly, “No need to change, just let me remember this, so I won’t think of heaven’s first and the National Master’s second, and I’m third in the future!”

Liu Qingfeng had nothing to say.

Once back in the carriage, Li Baozhen shivered.

The carriage slowly moved forward, leaving the reeds and merging onto the main road, without encountering Chen Pingan and his group again.

Liu Qingfeng calmly said, “First, I advise you to return to the Lion Garden; otherwise, once we reach the county government office, I’ll have to take care of you, bedridden. Second, I also advise you, as a reminder to myself, that words can wound; using schemes to harm others is like wielding a knife; using techniques to harm others is like poison from tigers and wolves.”

Li Baozhen’s lips turned pale as he stared at this fellow, his teeth chattering, asking, “Liu Qingfeng, do you know what I lost in this narrow encounter with that Chen Pingan? Do you need to say such light-hearted words?”

Liu Qingfeng asked, “Is life worth more than that?”

Li Baozhen grinned, “Not at all.”

He turned to the old coachman and shouted, “Turn back to the Lion Garden!”

Liu Qingfeng closed his eyes to rest.

At this moment, Li Baozhen truly began to regard this person in front of him as an ally on equal footing.

Or perhaps, Li Baozhen admitted that he was indeed not as good as Liu Qingfeng at this moment. Named Qingfeng, his heart was like dead ashes, but there were signs of rebirth from those ashes.

In dealing with people and matters, those who are dedicated remain blissfully unaware of the thunderous shocks.

Never did he expect that this small Qingluan Kingdom could produce such a character.

---

Stone Rou was the one who felt the lightest at heart.

She had inexplicably left the city overnight, claiming to meet an old acquaintance.

Pei Qian didn’t take it too seriously, but Stone Rou sensed the strange aura concealed within Chen Pingan—murderous intent.

Sure enough, Zhu Lian had engaged in a fierce fight with someone.

Fortunately, once Chen Pingan and Zhu Lian returned, they said everything was fine.

Stone Rou didn’t ask much; as long as Chen Pingan said there was no problem, she believed it. If Zhu Lian had promised he was fine, even if he pounded his chest, Stone Rou wouldn’t trust him.

Although Pei Qian didn’t understand the situation, the faint smell of blood emanating from Zhu Lian was still quite alarming.

Pei Qian asked softly, “Master, is it the enemies from our hometown?”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment, exhaling a breath of stale air that had built up in his chest for a long time. He took out the gourd and drank some of the frosty wine bought from a tavern in the capital, smiling, “No need to worry about that; it’s all settled.”

Pei Qian nodded, then asked with a smile, “Did you gain or lose by acting this time, Master?”

Zhu Lian knew that Chen Pingan had obtained a talisman and a jade pendant.

Though he hadn’t looked closely, Zhu Lian was certain of one thing: as long as Chen Pingan’s hometown acquaintances were wandering outside, none of them were ordinary people, such as Zheng Dafeng from the old Longcheng, and Li Er, who had just rushed past and left. One was at the ninth realm, the other at the tenth realm, so the two items Chen Pingan snatched from that fellow were definitely valuable.

But Chen Pingan said, “It was neither a gain nor a loss. The two items I obtained are just right for someone more suited to hold them.”

Pei Qian responded with an “oh.”

As long as everything was alright.

She turned her gaze toward the capital of Qingluan Kingdom.

Holding her walking stick in one hand and that small gourd in the other.

Zhu Lian turned his head, and Stone Rou’s gaze followed suit.

Zhu Lian smiled and asked, “Miss Stone Rou, are you worried about me?”

Stone Rou remained silent.

Zhu Lian clicked his tongue, “You don’t know, but the person I fought was a great master of the Far Travel Realm, with peak cultivation, incredibly powerful. One punch could shatter mountains; another could move mountains and seas…”

Stone Rou scoffed, “If you didn’t get killed, wouldn’t that make you invincible in the world?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “You don’t understand, that big brother was too polite; he never intended to trade blows with me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have stood here whole. If I had been covered in injuries, with white bones showing, you would have felt pity for me and shed tears, and I would have been heartbroken, surely angered enough to piece that big brother’s scattered remains back together and whip them again…”

Stone Rou ignored him.

Chen Pingan suddenly said, “After we go to the Dali Mountain Cliff Academy, we’ll be on our way back to Longquan County. We might need to find a ghost in a wedding dress hidden in the mountains, whose powers aren’t weak, but we may not be able to find her.”

Zhu Lian exclaimed in surprise, “Young Master, is that wedding dress ghost pretty? How does she compare to Miss Stone Rou when she was alive?”

Chen Pingan laughed, “When I first saw her back then, she was wearing a bright red wedding dress, with a pale face, and I found her quite unsettling. I didn’t pay much attention to how she looked.”

Pei Qian swallowed hard and took out a talisman to stick on her forehead.

Chen Pingan softly asked, “That eighth realm old man, how much strength do you think you can use to defeat him?”

Zhu Lian felt a bit embarrassed, “Young Master, when I fight with someone, I go all out. So if you don’t tell me to stop tonight, that big brother will really be torn to pieces. Whether or not he becomes a water ghost is debatable.”

Chen Pingan helplessly said, “That’s a… good habit.”

Zhu Lian looked glum.

Pei Qian gleefully said, “Old cook, why aren’t you flattering me this time? Didn’t you learn it from my master?”

Zhu Lian laughed and kicked Pei Qian in the butt. Pei Qian stumbled forward, instinctively jabbing her walking stick into the ground, spinning around quickly without cursing Zhu Lian out of curiosity as to why she hadn’t fallen. Instead, she drew out the walking stick she had cherished for a long time and ran to Chen Pingan’s side, confused, “Master, why hasn’t my ‘Old Mountain God’ walking stick broken yet? Look, not even a crack! Did I pick up a treasure right from the start? Is it really a divine tree planted by some mountain god?”

Chen Pingan smiled without answering.

Zhu Lian laughed heartily, “Your young master probably helped you refine this walking stick early on with a celestial method, or it would have been long gone. A common branch wouldn’t withstand the abuse of your crazy swordplay!”

Pei Qian scratched her head. “Oh, is that so?”

It seemed surprising yet reasonable.

Then, with a rather fanciful thought, Pei Qian raised her head, looking longingly at the night sky, “Why hasn’t it rained yet?”

Chen Pingan, walking alongside her, asked, “Why do you want it to rain?”

Pei Qian, while practicing the White Monkey Back Sword Technique, using her walking stick as her sword, answered, “If it rains, I can hold an umbrella for you.”

Zhu Lian kicked again, and Pei Qian nimbly dodged, Zhu Lian laughed and scolded, “You little glutton, how could you hold an umbrella for the young master?”

Pei Qian felt conflicted, her head drooping, “That’s true.”

Chen Pingan comforted her, “As long as the thought counts.”

Zhu Lian laughed, “This little troublemaker is left with only thoughts.”

Pei Qian glared at Zhu Lian, “If it weren’t for your injury, I’d definitely let you experience my self-created mad sword technique.”

“Come on, let’s practice.”

Zhu Lian stepped forward, and Pei Qian laughed, running around Chen Pingan.

Stone Rou, for a moment, seemed lost in thought.

Always surrounding Chen Pingan, Pei Qian, despite her antics in the mountains and rivers, was still a little black lump.

But when she ran under the bright moonlight on the pristine road, the girl radiated a faint glow of purity.

One could only wonder, on the day Pei Qian walks the martial world alone, would it be a completely different sight? Perhaps like a blazing sun, from afar, causing onlookers to feel burned?

Yet, such complex emotions, as they trekked through the mountains and waters together, made Stone Rou regret having such trivial thoughts.

After all, Pei Qian was just too wild.

Summer had arrived for some time, and they were nearing the celestial crossing on the eastern border of Qingluan Kingdom.

One day, while in the dense forest, Pei Qian ran off to gather some dry branches to start a fire for cooking. When she returned, covered in dirt and with grass in her hair, she had caught a gray wild rabbit, tugging it by its ears, and sprinted back to Chen Pingan, shaking the poor wild rabbit excitedly, “Master, look what I caught?! The legendary mountain jumper, it runs so fast!”

Chen Pingan laughed, “Today we’re only eating vegetarian, let it go.”

Pei Qian was astonished, then reluctantly said, “But I worked so hard to catch it. Can we fatten it up and then eat it? I can tie it with a long rope and take it with me.”

Chen Pingan waved his hand, “If you really want meat, I’ll have Zhu Lian catch you a wild boar later.”

Pei Qian thought about it and decided it was a safe trade-off, so she nodded, took a deep breath, spun around, and with all her might, tossed the wild rabbit away. In an instant, whether by luck or misfortune, the wild rabbit vanished, “Fly away, little buddy!”

Stone Rou covered her forehead.

Pei Qian clapped her hands and squatted beside Chen Pingan, who was building a stove, curiously asking, “Master, is there any special significance to today? For instance, is it some powerful mountain god’s birthday, so we can’t eat meat in the mountains?”

Chen Pingan simply smiled, “No significance.”

The celestial crossing on the border was the most unpretentious one Chen Pingan had seen.

Not only were there no hidden mountain water restrictions, but they were also eager to attract business, starting to solicit customers from dozens of miles away. This crossing had many peculiar routes, such as one leading to a celestial cave near Qingluan Kingdom, where one could fish for rare birds and flying fish at the “Fishing Terrace” atop the mountain.

Thus, the journey was bustling with people.

Here, Chen Pingan heard many tidings from the capital.

For instance, the Tang Emperor, in response to the people’s will, established Confucianism as the state religion.

As for who would be second among Buddhism and Daoism, it seemed to require further waiting.

A small Daoist temple called the White Cloud Temple in the capital suddenly became the royal family’s designated temple for worshipping gods in Qingluan Kingdom.

An originally obscure young monk at the Baishui Temple began to preach to the world, in the temple, on the bustling streets, and in the markets, purportedly speaking in a very simple and crude manner, understandable even to children learning the basics.

Smoothly boarding the not too large celestial ferry.

Pei Qian seemed to lose her enthusiasm, feeling somewhat down. After finishing her copywork in Chen Pingan’s room, she silently returned to her own room, as if she were a different person from her usual self.

Chen Pingan went to ask Zhu Lian, but Zhu Lian didn’t provide any explanation. So he turned to Stone Rou, who shared her perspective.

Thus, on this day, after Pei Qian finished her copywork, she prepared to leave.

Chen Pingan called out to her, taking her along to the bow of the boat to admire the scenery of the sea of clouds.

The pair stood at the railing, Chen Pingan took out the gourd, ready to drink.

Pei Qian pulled out the small gourd she had been holding, lifting it high above her head, looking left and right.

Chen Pingan still hadn’t drunk from his good wine gourd at his waist, turning to smile and ask, “Is there something on your mind?”

Pei Qian tiptoed, leaned over the railing, and softly asked, “Master, when we get to Dali Mountain Cliff Academy, will you only like that little Baoping who calls you ‘Little Master Uncle’ and not like me anymore?”

Chen Pingan gazed into the distance, shaking his head, “Of course not.”

Pei Qian plopped down on the ground, crossing her arms, “I don’t believe it!”

Chen Pingan sat beside her, raised his foot, and gestured for Pei Qian to come closer.

As soon as Pei Qian saw the boots on his feet, she immediately squinted with a smile, her fingers twirling the yellow-skinned small gourd, shaking it, “Master, let’s drink!”

Chen Pingan laughed heartily, took the gourd again, gently clinking it with the small gourd, and took a sip.

Pei Qian pretended that her small gourd also contained wine, mimicking the action of drinking. Then she stood up, took a few steps back, swaying as if she were a little drunk, “Oh dear, Master has drunk too much, too much…”

Chen Pingan watched this scene, unable to hold back his laughter.

Just as Chen Pingan was about to speak up to remind her.

Pei Qian lightly bumped into a burly man walking by, who had a long sword at his waist, sneering, “You little brat with no eyes, get the hell away from me!”

The man pressed down on Pei Qian’s head, twisting his wrist, trying to throw her away.

But before he could apply more force, his wrist was seized by the young man, who had previously only been seen from behind carrying a sword.

Pei Qian quickly said to the man, “Sorry, I didn’t see you pass by just now, I’m really sorry!”

The man frowned, feeling that his hand had been stopped and he had lost face, becoming stubborn. He suddenly increased his strength, intending to fling away this ignorant embroidered pillow and toss the troublesome little black lump out.

In an instant, a sharp pain shot through his wrist, causing the burly man to kneel on the ground with a thud, drenched in sweat.

Chen Pingan smiled gently at Pei Qian, signaling her to stand behind him.

With one hand gripping the gourd behind his back, Chen Pingan changed his grip on the burly martial artist’s wrist to seize his Tianling cap, bending down without any expression, asking, “Are you looking to die?”

With fingers like claws.

The burly man’s face turned pale, gritting his teeth in defiance.

In unbearable pain, he growled, “This grievance is not settled; it’s not over!”

Those who were traveling with him quickly rushed over, aiming to take advantage of their numbers to beat up this big and small pair for fun.

However, two flying swords hovered at the fore of the crowd, aimed at the brows of the foremost man.

At this moment, everyone felt as if they had fallen into an ice cave, chills running down their spines, even in the summer heat.

Among all, sword cultivators killing people were the most justified!

But it seemed that this group didn’t realize that, as far as the matter of settling grievances was concerned, Chen Pingan had not been lacking in this regard, and the backgrounds of those enemies were not small.

Thus, what Chen Pingan feared the least was this matter.

Chen Pingan yanked the kneeling burly man up, then kicked him in the chest, sending him flying, crashing into several companions, causing chaos as they all fled in a panic.

Chen Pingan turned back to Pei Qian and smiled, “Don’t be afraid. In the future, if anyone bullies you while you’re out in the martial world, just come home and find your master.” 

(End of Chapter)### Chapter 400: The Gift

The commotion at the bow of the boat was a far cry from the thunderous atmosphere it seemed to create.

A sword cultivator had revealed his life-bound flying swords—two of them, no less—yet in the end, not a single drop of blood was shed.

The spectators felt somewhat shortchanged.

The ferry carried around two hundred passengers, and amidst the cloud of chatter, opinions flew back and forth. For the people of Qingluan Kingdom, it was nothing unusual to see a lineage of celestial masters descending the mountain to travel, or to encounter wandering hermits scurrying after profit, or even the dignitaries who brought their families to expand their horizons aboard the celestial ferry. They had seen enough of the scenic views of rolling clouds and soaring cranes; it was this kind of conflict that truly piqued their interest. 

Each person held a distinct opinion, and while one party remained indifferent, the other was full of eagerness. In the end, they all seemed to agree that the young sword cultivator had acted too domineeringly. Over such a trivial matter, was it really necessary to resort to violence? Clearly, his identity as a sword cultivator could have resolved the issue, yet he had chosen to kick the man down instead. Wasn’t that just bullying?

Only one little girl, taken along by her parents to experience the world's wonders, innocently remarked, "But wasn't that guy in the wrong first?"

The nearby adults, engrossed in their discussions, including her well-bred parents from the noble families of Qingluan, pretended they hadn’t heard her innocent words. They continued speculating where the young sword cultivator might hail from—was it from the Thunder Garden of Li Tuanjing or the Sword Qi Peak of Zhengyang? Or perhaps they mocked him, claiming that this legendary sword cultivator had quite the temper for someone so young; who knew, he might one day encounter an even more unreasonable earth immortal and suffer the consequences.

The little girl timidly added, "If that big brother in the white robe with a sword hadn’t had any skills, wouldn’t he have already been bullied by all those people?"

The adults still ignored her childish viewpoint, thinking, "What does a child know?"

Feeling somewhat miffed at being overlooked, the little girl tiptoed to a quieter spot near the bow railing, straining to look outwards. Those clouds looked like the biggest cotton candy in the world, making her mouth water. She stretched out her hands, pretending to grab it, before popping an imaginary piece into her mouth and patting her belly, satisfied enough not to sulk at the adults anymore. She actually wanted to find that boy who looked like a little piece of black coal to play with, but she felt too shy at that moment, especially after her parents had warned her not to act too freely on this boat. After the earlier incident, she didn’t dare approach him anymore.

Suddenly, she noticed someone not far from the railing who was exceptionally handsome, even more so than the older brother who had protected the girl in black coal. 

This man seemed to be in his thirties, but he still gave off a somewhat vague impression—young and full of vitality.

He turned to meet her gaze for a brief moment, causing the little girl to quickly turn her head, pretending to admire the scenery.

The man smiled, mimicking the little girl’s action as he reached out towards a floating white cloud that resembled a mountain peak near the ferry. The snowy white mountain swayed slightly, and then a brilliant white line, glittering in the sunlight, floated into his hand. He playfully kneaded it into a ball and extended it towards the little girl, as if asking her if she wanted to try it. The little girl shook her head vigorously, and the man smiled as he tossed it into his own mouth.

The little girl gaped in admiration, her eyes wide in awe.

What a handsome immortal!

The man leaned against the railing, seemingly idle.

During this trip, he was not only seeking leisure but also hoping for a closer look at the potentially law-abiding young man.

He was none other than Wei Liang, the Grand Commander of Qingluan Kingdom.

He had previously set a trap to encircle the yellow cow and lure wild cultivators to their doom, and he was also the guardian of the capital during the ongoing debate between Buddhism and Taoism.

The debate between Buddhism and Taoism had not yet truly drawn to a close, so Wei Liang, whose age surpassed even the history of Qingluan Kingdom, the left-hand aide of the founding emperor, and once the kingdom's top strategist, had recently resigned from his position to accompany the current emperor, Tang Li. Even though Tang Li was reluctant, without Wei Liang overseeing the capital, and with the current complex situation in Qingluan, where dangers lurked on all sides, the emperor had no choice but to agree. 

After the founding emperor of Qingluan established the kingdom, he built pavilions and hung portraits for the twenty-four founding contributors. "Wei Qian" ranked quite lowly, but the descendants of the other twenty-three civil and military officials had all perished, while Wei Qian had merely changed his name to Wei Liang.

This ferry, named "Qingyi" (青衣), resembled the warships of secular dynasties on the vast lakes and rivers; it was slow and often took detours. This was done intentionally to allow half of the ferry's passengers to visit famous mountains of the celestial realm for entertainment, to fish for rare birds and flying fish with special rods crafted from unique woods on a fishing platform high above the sea of clouds; to admire the breathtaking sunrise and sunset from a peak teeming with inns; or to purchase pots of exotic flowers—seeds that had been cultivated by farming cultivators—at a celestial sect, which could then be proudly displayed in their courtyards or used as elegant bribes in officialdom. There were also some mountain tops where certain celestial beasts were deliberately raised, with cultivators accompanying wealthy hunters on their hunts, assisting them throughout the entire perilous process.

Throughout the flourishing years of Qingluan Kingdom, Wei Liang had remained solitary.

Each time he took a legitimate wife, it was merely a facade, hence he had no offspring.

Time had passed like a fleeting dream, and now it had been so many years.

Wei Liang crouched down and smiled, "Little girl, what is your name?"

The little girl hesitated for a moment and replied, "My name is Yuan Yanxu."

Wei Liang nodded, "Yuan, meaning 'words must have substance,' and Xu, meaning 'order.' It seems your family must have an elder who was an admirer of the 'Yifa Theory' from the Tongcheng School back in the day. This branch of knowledge has been dormant for many years; I guess your father didn’t name you, but rather your grandfather did?"

The little girl’s eyes widened in surprise. How could he guess that?

Wei Liang smiled and asked, "Shall we have a chat?"

The little girl dashed a few steps and squatted beside him, saying, "You talk, I'll listen carefully."

In the distance, her mother wore a worried expression and was about to go fetch her daughter back.

The woman's husband, a cultured middle-aged scholar, had the same intention. No one aboard the celestial ferry was an ordinary figure.

However, the elderly family guest accompanying them shook his head slightly at the middle-aged scholar and whispered, "This might be a celestial opportunity; it’s best for us to observe quietly."

Only then did the couple relax a little, while also feeling a sense of anticipation.

Wei Liang sat cross-legged, resting his hands on his knees as the celestial ferry sailed into a sea of clouds. Outside the railing, it looked like a long white river, truly living up to its name as a ferry.

Wei Liang first asked the little girl, Yuan Yanxu, her opinion about the earlier commotion, and she shared her thoughts.

Seeing the immortal gentleman nodding, Yuan Yanxu felt happy; finally, someone acknowledged her views.

Wei Liang slowly continued, “You children, fresh to the world, are like the most beautiful yet fragile porcelain. Whether you rise to glory or fall to ruin depends on how well you are taught. If taught well, your shape will be right; if not, it will grow awry.”

“Verbal teachings are important, but actions are even more crucial. Children may not understand adult reasoning, but they are always curious about the world. For a child to truly absorb and understand adult reasoning is quite difficult. They see much more with their eyes, and it’s easier for them to remember a general view of the world, which is simple and clear-cut. This gradual influence can happen without them even noticing. Over the years, their perception of the world solidifies, and it becomes difficult to change.”

“Thus, many seemingly inexplicable actions in adulthood are often traceable back to childhood. At critical moments in shaping character, a parent’s words and actions are vital. A scolding that misses the point, or overlooking misdeeds simply because the child is too young, ultimately harms both the child and themselves. Hence, rewards and punishments must be clear; parents should set rules for their children. Benevolence and righteousness are the foundations of righteousness, while punishment is the tail end.”

Wei Liang spoke steadily, neither hurried nor slow.

The little girl listened attentively, occasionally blinking her eyes.

Wei Liang continued, “Thus, in childhood, parents should teach benevolence and righteousness through example; as they grow, their teachers should impart the principles from books. The two approaches complement each other; the former teaches in a practical manner, while the latter teaches from a higher perspective. Both are necessary and cannot undermine each other.”

The little girl remained silent, unsure if she understood.

Yet when others spoke, she listened with her ears perked up, refraining from interrupting; she understood that much.

Wei Liang turned his head and asked with a smile, “Do you know what kind of person is more willing to listen to reason?”

The little girl shook her head.

Wei Liang answered his own question, “At first, children listen to their parents. Then students listen to their teachers. As they grow older, the weak listen to the strong, the poor listen to the rich, and subjects listen to their rulers—just as those at the base listen to those above, and those above listen to those at the peak. The problem arises when the strong might say something incorrect, yet the weak take all of their words as sacred. What should be done then? When morals and righteousness become ineffective, laws are needed—something that evokes more awe than all the celestial techniques above, binding the so-called strong and making them feel as children who fear their parents’ reprimands. Just like a teacher’s feather duster and ruler, a mistake will result in an immediate smack on the palm, making them know the pain.”

Wei Liang beamed, “You don’t quite understand, do you?”

Of course, the little girl didn’t understand; her mind was a jumble. “Hmm!”

Wei Liang laughed heartily, “You’ve actually absorbed it; you just don’t understand it yet. It’s all stored in your heart, showing that you are better than many adults, who often only learn a little wisdom after suffering loss. Little girl, although your cultivation talent is average, you come from a good background and have no worries about food and clothing. You’re unlikely to undergo a major change in temperament, and once you marry a good man, you will likely lead a good life.”

Yuan Yanxu felt somewhat shy.

Marriage was something she’d played pretend at with her peers, where they would find a piece of red satin to cover the “bride’s” head. If her “husband” was the little scholar from the Liu family next door, she would laugh more, but if it was the chubby little boy from the Ma family, she wouldn’t want to smile at all.

Wei Liang raised a finger, “Considering how smart and sensible you are, remember one thing. When you grow up, if you encounter a tremendous crisis that your family cannot handle, remember to go to the Grand Commander's mansion in the southern part of the capital and look for someone named Wei Liang. If the matter is urgent, you can also send a letter.”

Yuan Yanxu timidly replied, “Sir, that’s many years from now. Let’s not worry about it.”

Wei Liang shook his head and smiled, “You can’t think like that. Time flows like water; in the blink of an eye, you will have grown up. In another blink…”

You might have already passed away from old age.

However, he didn’t voice such untimely thoughts.

Wei Liang continued with a smile, “Good people can be bullied; does that mean we should stop being good? If evil people can only be corrected by evil people, should we become bad people? A gentleman can be taken advantage of; does that mean it is right to bully a gentleman? That’s wrong.”

“However, discussing good and evil among people is far too complex. Even when one recognizes right from wrong, how to deal with it remains a tremendous hassle. Just like the earlier commotion on the ferry today, if that young man with the sword had patiently reasoned with that group, would they have listened? They might say they would, but would their hearts accept it? So what’s the point of speaking or not? What that group really wants to hear isn’t the truth, but the current situation. Once the paths diverge, the situation changes, and people’s natures are hard to change. Who knows? Perhaps sitting down to discuss things might only invite more trouble. Let’s forget about these things for now; it’s more comforting to look at the sea of clouds.”

These were more like Wei Liang’s musings than anything else, and he didn’t expect the little girl to fully grasp it.

In fact, if Yuan Yanxu’s parents had been listening, it would have been equally fruitless—not because they couldn’t understand, but because they felt that discussing such matters was less practical than the lofty principles of the world.

Wei Liang had already been an earth immortal over two hundred years ago, but in order to promote his own ideology, he planned to use the transformation of a nation’s customs and practices as an opportunity for his own enlightenment. Hence, he had taken on the name “Wei Qian” and traveled to the southeastern part of Baoping Continent, assisting the founding emperor of Qingluan, Tang, in establishing the kingdom. Since then, he had aided successive emperors of the Tang dynasty in enacting laws, and prior to this debate between Buddhism and Taoism, Wei Liang had never acted as an earth immortal towards court officials and cultivators.

As a result, not only had he exhausted himself, but progress had been slow. During the reign of two emperors, he had even walked a significant distance back.

This left Wei Liang feeling disappointed.

Finally, with a smile, Wei Liang took his leave, only reminding the little girl to keep the matters regarding the letter and the Grand Commander's mansion a secret.

After Wei Liang’s figure disappeared, Yuan Yanxu’s parents and family guests approached her, eager to inquire about the details of their conversation.

The little girl, feeling the pressure, initially intended to keep their agreement a secret, but ultimately couldn’t hide anything. After a long struggle against her parents’ eager questioning, she revealed everything.

The elderly guest was delighted and whispered with the middle-aged scholar, claiming that the man must be a revered immortal serving the Grand Commander! Perhaps he was even a favored disciple of the Grand Commander!

The Yuan family was fortunate!

The elderly guest urged the scholar to remember that these immortals were unpredictable and should not be judged by common sense. Therefore, they should not go overboard or pay a visit to show gratitude; it was best for the Yuan family to act as if they knew nothing.

The couple felt overwhelmingly excited.

Only the little girl felt guilty about the immortal gentleman, squatting by the railing and feeling a bit lost.

Wei Liang, having walked some distance away, sighed.

Such trivial matters didn’t disappoint Wei Liang, nor would he reconsider his choices because of them; he simply felt no surprise. In the future, when the Yuan family, classified as a second-rate family in the capital of Qingluan Kingdom, encountered trouble, even if that letter could not reach the Grand Commander’s mansion, Wei Liang would still step in to help.

However, that little girl named Yuan Yanxu had lost a chance to embark on a path of cultivation.

Yet Wei Liang also understood that for Yuan Yanxu, this might not be a bad thing after all.

To find stability in this world was already a rare feat.

Once she ascended the mountain to cultivate and became a Qi Practitioner, beginning to wrestle with the heavens, it would be unnecessary to discuss right and wrong in humanity; those lacking determination often found it hard to come to a good end.

Chen Pingan led Pei Qian back to their cabin on the ferry.

Pei Qian astonishingly declared that she would copy an additional five hundred characters today.

Chen Pingan didn’t stop her; he merely reminded her that the extra writing wouldn’t count for tomorrow.

Pei Qian puffed out her chest, saying, “Of course not.”

While copying, she placed her yellow gourd nearby.

Chen Pingan sat across from her, continuing to skim through a book on Legalism that he had bought after being prompted by Cui Dongshan. It wasn’t a rare edition, but it belonged to the fundamental "serious" texts that supported the teachings of the Three Schools. Chen Pingan had memorized the advice given by Lu Tai regarding reading, such as starting with thick texts before moving to thinner ones, and “following the vine to find relatives,” as well as tips on selecting books. Although the philosophies of the various schools were intricate and vast, the truly essential works that deserved the label “beneficial upon opening” did not exceed fifty. Any ordinary person who had lived seventy years could read them thoroughly.

Therefore, the three Legalist texts Chen Pingan chose were merely to ensure that the print was accurate.

What pleased Chen Pingan most about Pei Qian today was still her adherence to the principle of “acting from the heart” that he had previously shared with her.

When one does wrong, they should sincerely apologize first.

Moreover, the current Pei Qian was a world apart from the Pei Qian he had first encountered in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. From the moment the storm arose to its resolution, her sole focus had been on copying books.

Not once did she turn around to curse that group of people with wishes of ill fortune.

Chen Pingan asked, “Pei Qian, you were almost thrown off the boat by that guy who pressed your head down; aren’t you angry?”

“Of course! On the way here, I cursed them all in my heart—those eight big bad guys, each with a different way to die! Like the one who got taught a lesson by the master, tripping and falling off the boat, just like that—bam! Crushed to bits. Then there’s that lady with a prominent ‘卧蠶’ (forbidden) face, who suddenly got into an argument, ended up getting slapped left and right until she couldn’t find a single tooth left in her mouth, haha! And that monkey-faced one, who ate something bad, rolled on the floor crying for help since there was no doctor on the boat…”

Pei Qian was focused on copying her book, but she accidentally spilled her thoughts out. Suddenly realizing, she grimaced and said, “Master, you decide whether to scold me or take my ear!”

Chen Pingan wasn’t really angry; he just smiled and asked, “What if…”

Pei Qian seemed to know what Chen Pingan was about to ask, standing up straight and declaring, “Master, don’t worry! I’m just thinking of it for fun! Even if I learn the world’s most exceptional sword techniques and unbeatable fist techniques one day, I wouldn’t actually do anything to those guys! At most, I’d kick them like you did!”

Chen Pingan was curious and asked, “Why?”

Pei Qian looked at him as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “I’m your disciple, Master! I’m the first disciple! If I stoop to their level, I’m just embarrassing you! Besides, it’s not a big deal. I’ve had my fair share of fights and kicks when I was little! Now I’m a wealthy person, and half of a traveler; I’m much more magnanimous!”

At that moment, Zhu Lian happened to enter with Shi Rou, giving her a thumbs-up. “Pei Heroine’s flattery skills have become even more refined!”

Pei Qian continued to focus on her copying, feeling extremely happy today and not wanting to bicker with the old chef.

Chen Pingan said to Zhu Lian, “Those guys are definitely going to come apologize; help me stop them and tell them to scram.”

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “Master, why not see them and talk reason with them?”

Zhu Lian laughed, “What do you know?”

Pei Qian inexplicably didn’t retort and instead smiled broadly.

Last time, while leaving Lion Garden on the path, she had caught a fart to tease Zhu Lian and Shi Rou. So really, it was the old chef who knew nothing.

Zhu Lian stood beside Pei Qian, observing how she wrote, noting that her penmanship was likely learned from Chen Pingan. Now, it could be considered somewhat decent.

As he watched her write diligently and meticulously, he said, “Young Master, talking nicely to such people will only make them think they can take advantage of you. They’ll surely say they’ll never do it again in front of you, but once they turn around, they’ll feel proud and boast that they became friends with Young Master after a fight. After they leave the ferry, they’ll continue their own ways, and you’ll find they’ll brag about having a sword cultivator friend—a reputation that will make them feared. You think that’s a trivial matter?”

Pei Qian looked up and asked in confusion, “How does that make them friends? Aren’t we enemies with them?”

Zhu Lian replied casually, “We know, but the Jianghu doesn’t.”

Pei Qian stopped writing, irritated, and slammed her hand on the table. “Why is the Jianghu like this?!”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Just focus on copying your book and try to finish it all in one go. It’s best not to dawdle in between.”

Pei Qian responded with an “Oh!” and continued her copying.

Sure enough, footsteps echoed outside, mostly belonging to pure martial artists of the third or fourth realm, with only one from the fifth.

They began to knock on the door.

Zhu Lian opened the door and kicked one of them flying. “Don’t come here disturbing my Young Master’s peace. If I see you again, I’ll squash you like a bug!”

That group of people, trembling in fear, bowed and left in a flurry.

Nearby, nearly half of the rooms had their doors opened, all curious to see whether blood would be spilled or if this would turn into a beautiful tale of the Jianghu.

The outcome was rather mundane, leaving everyone feeling somewhat bored.

However, a few wandering cultivators felt somewhat relieved.

If that group of brash people gained popularity because of this, they would be utterly envious of this young sword cultivator, whose depth was unfathomable.

Watching Chen Pingan quietly observing Pei Qian as she copied, meticulously checking for any mistakes, Shi Rou suddenly felt as though her hundreds of years of ghostly existence had come to resemble a dog’s.

Wasn’t he still under twenty?

He shouldn’t be able to see human hearts so clearly.

Chen Pingan suddenly turned his head and asked with a laugh, “Why have you been staring at me for so long?”

Shi Rou felt a bit bashful and shook her head.

Seeing Chen Pingan’s strange expression, Shi Rou feared he might misunderstand, thinking she had some inappropriate intentions. This made her even more uncomfortable, and she abruptly stood up, twisting her waist and walking away.

Chen Pingan was left perplexed.

He just felt that being stared at like that by someone like “Du Mao” gave him goosebumps.

Zhu Lian, reveling in the chaos, said, “Young Master is truly a phoenix among men; any woman who meets someone like you is bound to be led astray for life!”

Chen Pingan sighed, “Zhu Lian, sometimes, your flattery is not as pleasing as Pei Qian’s.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “After all, Pei Qian is naturally gifted in flattery, while this old servant is merely putting in the effort.”

Pei Qian diligently copied her book, not lifting her head, but her expression was filled with irritation. “Old chef, just you wait. Once I finish copying, I still have one hundred and twenty-five words left. By then, you’ll be in for it!”

Zhu Lian laughed, “What are you planning? Compete with me in eating dung or cursing people?”

Chen Pingan could no longer listen and simply took out the priceless “True Body of the God of Day and Night” talisman and the jade pendant engraved with the Dragon Palace.

Because Li Baozhen had “opened the door,” and Chen Pingan didn’t know how to close it, both items had been losing spiritual energy. However, compared to the ample spiritual energy of the talisman and the jade pendant, the loss was nearly negligible.

Just like the small canal dug with a hoe outside Lion Garden to drain the swamp.

This only highlighted the fatal flaw of purely martial artists drawing talismans.

One was fiery and swift, like the turning of the seasons, waiting for no one.

The other was a gentle stream, like an immortal’s cave, evergreen throughout the seasons.

Zhu Lian exclaimed in amazement, “I can’t tell the value of the jade pendant, but this talisman from the second son of the Li family should be… the supreme treasure among celestial talismans?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “The talisman lineage belongs to a major branch of Taoism, changing endlessly—everything is a celestial mystery. Once mastered, it allows cultivators to roam freely. Even when facing the sword cultivator with the greatest killing power, one can still use the well-character talisman or sword-locking talisman. Compared to other Qi Practitioners who fear sword cultivators like tigers, this is already quite good. Moreover, it can exorcise evil spirits and fulfill missions, so generally, cultivators carry a few talismans for emergencies. As for the quantity or quality, that depends on their finances.”

Noticing Zhu Lian’s gaze on him.

During the battle at Lion Garden, aside from using gold to paint talismans, Chen Pingan had also revealed a large handful of high-quality rare talismans.

Chen Pingan smiled and said, “The story behind them will have to wait until we reach the Ruinous Mountain in Longquan County, and then I’ll share it with you and Pei Qian. In any case, this is roughly why I didn’t kill Li Baozhen.”

Zhu Lian didn’t press any further and rubbed his hands, “Young Master, can I have a chance to train with you?”

Chen Pingan nodded, standing up, “This time, you can be a bit rougher; don’t worry about whether I can take it. You have no idea how I fed punches to others back in the day. Once you’ve seen it, you’ll know that when Zheng Dafeng was feeding you punches in the old Longcheng drugstore, it was really… well, if I were to put it in your words, it was like a man gently painting a woman’s eyebrows.”

Zhu Lian laughed, “That sounds good. Back then, I felt it wasn’t enough, but with Sui Youbiao around, I didn’t want to say much.”

Pei Qian had already finished copying her book.

Chen Pingan said, “Go back to your own room; otherwise, you’ll definitely be startled later.”

Pei Qian promised in a loud voice, “I won’t!”

Chen Pingan first took out an Exorcism Talisman and pasted it inside the room.

After a stick of incense, Pei Qian simply watching the two sparred left her drenched in sweat, her heart racing. Later, she simply ran to the corner, rummaging through Chen Pingan’s bamboo box to take out her treasure box.

If she wanted to practice martial arts and become the supreme master in her mind, Pei Qian would certainly pretend that the Jianghu didn’t exist, believing there was no such thing in this world. Instead, she could just flip through stories in books.

Chen Pingan wore a golden robe with a golden lining, saving him a lot of trouble.

He and Zhu Lian returned to the table, pouring a glass of misty wine that he had bought in the capital of Qingluan for Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian drank it all in one gulp, and without Chen Pingan needing to pour more, he took the wine jug and filled it for himself.

Pei Qian reminded him, “Old chef, drink less. Drinking too much wine is bad for your health, and besides, a jug of misty wine costs three taels of silver!”

Zhu Lian began to drink slowly, asking quietly, “Young Master, when do you plan to break through the bottleneck and reach the sixth realm?”

Chen Pingan had already made up his mind in his heart and said, “Just wait a little longer. There’s an opportunity I can strive for.”

Chen Pingan didn’t elaborate further on what the opportunity was; after all, the phrase “the strongest” was even more elusive than a nation’s martial fortune that could manifest itself.

Chen Pingan smiled, “If you want me to take a chance in those broken celestial blessed lands to seize opportunities and treasures, I’m not too keen on that.”

However, with the foundation of martial arts he had built up through punch after punch, he felt it was worth trying.

Yet Chen Pingan also understood that as long as Cao Ci remained in the fifth realm, not just he, but no one else would have any hope.

The top sword immortal had personally stated that Cao Ci’s martial cultivation was far ahead of his peers; every realm he reached would be the strongest in the world.

At that time, Ning Yao had been somewhat unconvinced, saying that even if Master Cao Ci was the number one martial artist in the world, and his martial luck could be manifested, in such a vast world, every day had unexpected changes. How could Cao Ci certainly be the strongest in every realm? Was it possible that his ancestors were all shopkeepers, monopolizing the fortunes of the world?

At that time, Chen Qingdu had said something that left a deep impression on Chen Pingan.

“Cao Ci is simply that strong, from his bones and talent to his temperament and martial fortune; it’s all the same; there’s no reasoning to it.”

At that time, Chen Pingan had just lost three matches to Cao Ci. He himself didn’t feel much, but Ning Yao was already furious.

Seeing Ning Yao like that made Chen Pingan quite happy, but in turn, Ning Yao became even angrier.

At this moment, Zhu Lian subconsciously blurted out, “Young Master is certainly a person blessed with great fortune; how could he return empty-handed from a treasure mountain? Now that I’m at least in the Golden Body realm, I understand a little about those broken celestial blessed lands. I know that upper fifth realm cultivators can’t enter. Once inside, the blessed lands become unstable and can easily collapse, easily swept away by the chaotic rivers of time, severely wearing down one’s Dao cultivation. Without upper fifth realm cultivators lurking, and with this old servant assisting you, it seems now is a good time for Young Master to take a chance. If you encounter such a place next time, don’t forget to bring me along. After all, we are purely martial artists; it’s no big deal, and we won’t be bound by such rules.”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment and nodded, “That makes sense. I’ve grown accustomed to avoiding these situations, but it seems I need to change my mindset.”

Pei Qian initially furrowed her brow at the mention of “great fortune,” but upon hearing Zhu Lian’s later words, she relaxed.

Zhu Lian pondered for a moment.

Meanwhile, time on this celestial ferry drifted leisurely.

Many scenic spots with signs indicating celestial blessed lands did not have a ferry point that could continuously consume celestial money. Thus, this ferry could not “dock.” Instead, it had early preparations in place for some celestial boatmen who could float and ride the winds, taking passengers arriving at their destination to small ferry points on the mountain tops. 

As they passed by the renowned fishing platform located in the northern region of Qingluan Kingdom, many passengers disembarked. Chen Pingan, Pei Qian, and Zhu Lian arrived at the bow and saw massive clouds flowing like streams between two towering mountains. The two great fishing platforms stood atop the mountains beside the sea of clouds, where colorful birds would occasionally burst from the clouds, soaring, then diving back in.

Pei Qian was captivated, wishing she could ride the winds and fly over, holding a hiking staff to knock down those birds and flying fish, then return to the ferry; it should fetch a good price. Perhaps with a few more trips like that, she could buy a treasure box or even a treasure rack.

Zhu Lian was a martial artist of the eighth realm, but having followed Chen Pingan all this way, he had only walked, with no experience of traveling by wind.

Chen Pingan curiously asked, “Zhu Lian, don’t you have any thoughts? Wouldn’t you feel you’re neglecting your own realm?”

Zhu Lian shook his head and smiled, “Young Master, I’ve long since grown weary of people's astonished looks back in my hometown; it’s hard to muster that reckless youthful spirit.”

Shi Rou remained silently enjoying the scenery.

She had long since become accustomed to Zhu Lian’s unusual thoughts, treating them as normal.

———

While Chen Pingan and his party were enjoying the scenery.

Wei Liang was seated at a writing desk in a room, jotting down something, with an antique zitan wooden box beside him filled with “gentlemanly weapons” paper-cutting knives.

He took out a bamboo yellow carving knife to serve as a paperweight.

Although Wei Liang had left the capital, claiming to be traveling for leisure, in actuality, he had been working on one task all along.

His relationship with Qingluan Kingdom was neither too great nor too small.

He was compiling a ranking of the celestial masters of Baoping Continent, needing to create a comprehensive outline.

Wei Liang drafted a preliminary framework for a nine-rank classification.

The first rank consisted solely of the immortals from the upper five realms of Baoping Continent.

The second rank encompassed the Jade Purity realm among the upper five realms, or those who contributed to the establishment of the Great Li’s Southern Iron Cavalry.

The third rank was for the Nascent Soul realm, or contributions equivalent to opening up a state.

The fourth rank was for the Golden Core realm.

Gradually down to the last, the ninth rank.

The specific divisions were quite complex and not strictly tied to the realms of Qi Practitioners; they also needed to consider the imperial court of the Great Li, particularly the military, in terms of the recorded merits of the cultivators during the southern expedition.

Among them was Ruan Qiong of the Longquan Sword Sect, who was not only the top of the second rank but was also temporarily in the highest position on this list that would be used by the Great Li for their merit record.

Additionally, the ancestral grounds of Zhenwu Mountain and Fengxue Temple, as well as the major sword sects of Fengleiyuan and Zhengyang Mountain.

Further down were places like the Great Li’s Changchun Palace, Yunxia Mountain, and the Xu family of Qingfeng City.

Each of these required one or two spots, and it was settled that they would be featured, with guaranteed ranks not being low.

As for those who held the Peaceful and Untroubled Plaque issued by the Great Li’s Ministry of Justice, they would certainly be included.

Additionally, any celestial masters who were among the first to submit loyalty to the Great Li, regardless of their background, whether they were lineage celestial masters or wandering cultivators, would also be able to gain entry.

Recently, Wei Liang had been perfecting the details, which required substantial intelligence from that person, even involving the fate of a nation and the secrets surrounding the emperor’s life and death.

Wei Liang placed his brush on the pen holder and began to pace slowly around the room.

The reason he was willing to engage in this matter was not because he was forced by the situation to rely on that embroidered tiger; in fact, if Cui An couldn’t convince him, Wei Liang could easily forsake over two hundred years of investment in Qingluan Kingdom to start anew in another continent, like the more lawless Julu Continent or the relatively stable Tongye Continent. With the foundation laid by Qingluan Kingdom, it would merely take another one or two hundred years of effort.

However, this time, Cui An came to Qingluan and was the first to find him, Wei Liang. They had a candid discussion, and after Wei Liang learned about this Great Li national master and the established national policy direction, he decided to cooperate.

Cooperate, not submit.

Wei Liang did not compromise or haggle; Cui An had no doubts about this either.

Undeniably, what Cui An sought was more far-reaching than what Wei Liang desired, which made Wei Liang very much look forward to the scene Cui An described appearing before him one day.

“To inscribe the laws of the Great Li on stone tablets, establishing them at the peaks of the Baoping mountains!”

Wei Liang approached the window, his gaze fervent, pride swelling within him.

It surpassed even the rushing sea of clouds flowing between the two towering mountains beneath his feet.

A true man should aspire to such a thing, so that he may not waste his life nor betray all he has learned!

———

Chen Pingan had already taken the ferry across the continent three times. He knew that the “Qingyi” ferry was inherently slow, but he hadn’t anticipated the many detours it would take. After intentionally navigating along the northeastern and northern borders of Qingluan, dropping off several batches of passengers, he thought he could speed up once they finally left Qingluan’s territory. However, the ferry then made a stop within a vassal state of Yunxiao Kingdom, finally coming to a halt at noon today, suspended in the territory of this small kingdom, claiming it would set sail again at dusk tomorrow. The guests could explore the central peak, especially since it happened to be the day for gambling on stones, which offered an opportunity for a small gamble for fun. If they struck it rich, it would be a good thing. The central peak, known as the "Lampstone," was praised as “Little Yunxia Mountain.” Once the right stones were wagered, a few snowflake coins could yield top-quality lampstone marrow, and if one obtained a piece as big as a fist, it would be a tremendous fortune overnight. Ten years ago, a wandering cultivator had used his last twenty-six snowflake coins to buy a lampstone nobody wanted, the size of a stone pedestal, and ended up with lampstone marrow worth thirty snowflake coins, bright red as fire.

Of course, if the ferry passengers did not wish to disembark, they could remain resting aboard the “Qingyi.”

After hearing the ferry maid’s explanation, Chen Pingan fell momentarily speechless. Once the maid left, he walked to the window and glanced at the so-called central peak not far away, feeling a mix of laughter and tears.

Claimed to be a central peak, it was not even comparable to the Cloud Mountain in his hometown, let alone the Ruinous Mountain that belonged solely to him.

Chen Pingan could only prepare to disembark with the three of them, waiting for the small boats to ferry them to the “Great Mountain” of the central peak.

He could easily guess that the deity of this central peak was in cahoots with the owner of the “Qingyi” ferry, both benefitting from this business relationship.

While Chen Pingan and his companions were waiting for the small boats, the surrounding ferry passengers instinctively gave them space, although they certainly couldn’t avoid whispering about them.

That previous batch of Jianghu people who had suffered losses at the hands of the “young sword cultivator” had already left in disgrace after their failed apology.

Everyone had different mindsets.

Whether old or young, the celestial masters were mostly envious of Chen Pingan, who had nurtured two life-bound flying swords, although they hid it well.

The wandering cultivators were filled with fear.

The wealthy people from the secular world, influenced by the discussions among the ferry passengers, mostly felt that sword cultivators were indeed as arrogant and overbearing as the legends said.

Only among the ferry crew was there a newfound respect for Chen Pingan and his companions. They even selected a beautiful girl to occasionally knock on the door, bringing them a plate of celestial fruits and vegetables.

There was also a small pavilion on the ferry, whimsically named “Celestial Qi Pavilion,” specifically for certain esteemed guests who had traveled on the Qingyi ferry to leave behind a piece of calligraphy.

Chen Pingan politely declined, instead letting Zhu Lian handle it and write a piece.

They boarded a small boat adorned with engraved talismans and shimmering gold and made their way to the foot of that central peak.

There were not many genuine worshippers; most were power-hungry young nobles and Jianghu heroes who had come to gamble on stones.

However, these characters, accustomed to treating others with disdain, found themselves softer in tone when they encountered the ferry passengers disembarking from the small boats.

On the ferry, there had been three incense vendors from different temples affiliated with the central peak, nearly coming to blows over customer disputes. The incense vendor from the central peak temple was the most irritable, while the vendors from the mid-mountain Taoist temple and the foot of the mountain temple were also throwing soft barbs at each other. Anyway, each showcased their unique strengths, and all had some harvest, as they boarded the small boats to lure customers, taking some willing incense-burning ferry passengers with them.

The ferry manager specially led the incense vendor from the central peak temple to Chen Pingan and his party, introducing them.

Upon hearing that Chen Pingan did not currently desire to burn incense, the man still smiled widely, flattering them with polite remarks about how honored they were by Chen Gongzi’s presence.

Once Chen Pingan’s feet touched the ground, the incense vendor still on the ferry spat contemptuously over the railing.

Zhu Lian, grinning, suggested, “Young Master, how about I give this fellow some rewards for our first encounter?”

Chen Pingan waved his hand, “Perhaps it’s the only time we’ll meet in a lifetime; there’s no reason to fuss over it.”

Pei Qian curiously asked, “What’s going on?”

Zhu Lian laughed, “Someone just took a dump and peed right above your head; quickly look up!”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes.

At the foot of the mountain was a long street specifically offering gambling stones, lined with dozens of shops, large and small.

Inside and outside the shops were piled with gray lampstones, the smallest barely the size of a palm, while the largest towered over a person, weighing over ten thousand pounds. Such massive stones were often the treasures of the respective shops. These lampstones, unique to the central peak of the Chengtian Kingdom, were named for their legendary highest-quality lampstone marrow, which was as red as blood and incredibly thick, containing no impurities. They flickered like flames, and holding one could naturally intimidate evil spirits.

Interestingly, even earth immortals could not see the quality within before opening the stones.

Chen Pingan had no interest in these and handed each of Pei Qian and the others ten snowflake coins, allowing them to choose their stones and gamble.

He then set off alone, intending to visit the temple at the top of the mountain, agreeing to meet the others at an inn at the foot of the mountain at dusk.

Pei Qian hesitated a bit and asked if she had to buy stones.

Chen Pingan smiled, pinching her dark face, “You’ve got ten snowflake coins now; spend it however you like.”

Pei Qian responded with an “Oh.”

Once Chen Pingan had walked far away and started ascending the mountain, Pei Qian immediately leaped up, flailing her arms and legs, excitedly practicing her mad sword techniques.

Zhu Lian had barely managed to visit two shops before buying a lampstone he found appealing, only to realize it was a complete loss.

Pei Qian nearly fought him over it in her fury.

Zhu Lian held Pei Qian’s forehead down with one hand, allowing her to flail her arms and legs as she wished.

Shi Rou, holding ten snowflake coins, was observantly and carefully listening, moving from shop to shop, often picking up a lampstone, examining it for a long time, then placing it back, delaying spending even a single snowflake coin.

Zhu Lian praised, “You really know how to live your life.”

Pei Qian followed closely behind Shi Rou, her eyes glued to the various lampstones, wishing she could stick her eyeballs right to them.

Having received several kicks to her rear from Zhu Lian and being mocked for dropping coins, she thought nothing of it when she dropped a stone into a pile of rocks.

Zhu Lian quickly regretted not following Chen Pingan up the mountain.

Shi Rou and Pei Qian, these two young ladies, truly had exceptional perseverance when it came to shopping. They insisted on visiting every shop, carefully inspecting each lampstone. Moreover, whenever a customer bought a lampstone and asked the shop to help open it, the two were bound to stop and watch intently, as if they cared more about the results than even the wealthy customers who spent lavishly on the stones.

Zhu Lian found walking easy, but he felt mentally exhausted.

Eventually, when Zhu Lian looked up at the sky, he estimated that even Chen Gongzi was nearing the foot of the mountain.

Shi Rou finally purchased a lampstone the size of a palm, paying two snowflake coins according to the shop’s price.

When it was opened, it surprisingly revealed a thumb-sized piece of bright red lampstone marrow, leaving even the shopkeeper genuinely astonished.

The small size of the lampstone didn’t particularly indicate its immense value, but this small stone yielding that much marrow was indeed rare.

Shi Rou smiled, planning not to sell that piece of vibrant and thick lampstone marrow.

After leaving the shop, Pei Qian suddenly tugged at Shi Rou’s sleeve, whispering, “Sister Shi Rou, could you lend me eight snowflake coins?”

Shi Rou asked curiously, “You’re not buying stones, so what would you need money for?”

Pei Qian replied seriously, “I want to buy a stone!”

Shi Rou was puzzled, “But we’ve already checked out so many shops; do you remember which one?”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously.

Shi Rou smiled and handed over her remaining eight snowflake coins to Pei Qian.

Pei Qian took a deep breath and began to run.

Shi Rou and Zhu Lian exchanged glances and quickly followed.

They had no idea what Pei Qian was plotting.

Eventually, they discovered Pei Qian standing in a corner of a shop piled high with various lampstones, straining to “pull out” a lampstone that was too large for her to even hug with both arms; it must have weighed at least—

Although the lampstone looked unassuming, it had been on the market for over a hundred years, remaining unsold.

Pei Qian started to haggle with the shopkeeper, saying she only had fifteen snowflake coins, which was her entire savings accumulated over the years.

The old shopkeeper found the little girl interesting. She didn’t seem at all like a child from a wealthy family, being dark-skinned, yet she had managed to save up fifteen snowflake coins. That was equivalent to fifteen thousand taels of silver, which would make her quite the wealthy child in the counties of the Chengtian Kingdom.

The old shopkeeper actually thought it reasonable to cut five snowflake coins off the price; fifteen snowflake coins was not a loss. Otherwise, this sizable stone, which the appraiser estimated to be worth ten snowflake coins, might sit around for another century, passing to his grandchildren without ever selling.

However, the old man still engaged in a classic back-and-forth with Pei Qian over the price, each trying to outsmart the other, for about half an incense stick’s worth of time, curious to see what excuses and reasons this little girl could come up with to save those five snowflake coins.

In the end, the old shopkeeper laughed heartily, agreeing to the deal. When he saw that the black-skinned girl pulled out a large handful of snowflake coins, he couldn’t help but flinch when she put three coins back into her sleeve, handing him the remaining fifteen.

The old man’s mouth twitched.

The little girl was being somewhat unfair.

Pei Qian feigned ignorance, grinning.

Zhu Lian pretended not to know Pei Qian.

Zhu Lian then gave her a thumbs-up. “As expected of the first disciple!”

The old shopkeeper was not angered; instead, he thought the clever little girl would make a good businessperson and asked with a laugh, “Would you like us to help you open the stone on-site?”

Pei Qian nodded, “Yes, please do. Otherwise, I can’t carry it. According to your rules, any lampstone under twenty snowflake coins can be opened for free. Also, if a good stone is opened, whether or not to give the shopkeeper a tip is up to the buyer. If I don’t give you a tip, old sir, you mustn’t be angry.”

The old shopkeeper laughed joyfully and nodded in agreement.

Pei Qian suddenly told the old shopkeeper to wait, turning to look at Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian, sharing a tacit understanding, nodded, “Go ahead, Young Master isn’t here; I’ll be here for you.”

Pei Qian tilted her head, smiling brightly, and suddenly turned to the old shopkeeper, waving her hand, “Open the stone!”

She then returned the remaining three snowflake coins to Shi Rou, whispering, “I still owe you five; I’ll pay you back later.”

After half an incense stick’s time.

The entire street at the foot of the mountain was in shock.

With Pei Qian’s satchel already slung over her shoulder, she now bore an additional heavy bundle.

The old shopkeeper behind her was pounding his chest in regret.

A once-in-a-century piece of lampstone marrow!

Worth three gu yu coins!

Zhu Lian, with hands tucked into his sleeves, smiled leisurely as he followed behind the grandly striding Pei Qian.

Shi Rou found the whole situation utterly unbelievable.

Just then, Chen Pingan happened to descend the mountain, arriving at the end of the street.

Seeing Pei Qian, who was now the center of attention, Chen Pingan felt a mix of confusion and amusement.

As soon as Pei Qian spotted the familiar figure, she immediately dashed over, panting heavily.

Chen Pingan laughed and asked, “What happened? Did Zhu Lian or Shi Rou find a hidden treasure?”

Pei Qian simply smiled.

Zhu Lian and Shi Rou joined them, with Zhu Lian chuckling softly, “Young Master, this little money-maker managed to use fifteen snowflake coins to open a piece of lampstone marrow worth at least three gu yu coins.”

Chen Pingan smiled, ruffling Pei Qian’s hair, “That’s quite impressive!”

He was pleased, but it didn’t quite shock or surprise him.

Pei Qian’s eyes narrowed into crescent moons, her head tilted to the side as she struggled to take off her bag and handed it to Chen Pingan, “Master, this is a birthday gift for you!”

Chen Pingan was shocked, pausing for a long moment before placing his palm on Pei Qian’s small head, a rare smile spreading across his face, “Is that so? Then Master will accept it!”

Zhu Lian was witnessing this joyful side of Chen Pingan for the first time.

When Chen Pingan reunited with Zhang Shanfeng and Xu Yuanxia, he was certainly happy, but it wasn’t the same kind of joy he felt in this moment.

Pei Qian nodded, apologizing, “But Master, I might not be able to give you such a good gift on next year’s May Fifth!”

Chen Pingan took the bundle and placed it in the bamboo box on his back, then held Pei Qian’s hand to walk down the street together.

Pei Qian excitedly recounted the stunned expressions of everyone when they opened the stone.

Chen Pingan smiled and listened to her chatter.

As the sun set in the west, the afterglow stretched their shadows—one large and one small.

Zhu Lian continued with his hands in his sleeves, while Shi Rou looked on with gentle eyes.

(End of this chapter)### Chapter 401: Journey to the North

The group had originally planned to stay at an inn at the foot of the mountain, but to their dismay, it was fully booked. With only one room left here and another there, Chen Ping’an felt uneasy and worried that Shi Rou would not be able to protect Pei Qian on her own. Thus, they decided to take a flying boat back to the suspended ferryboat, Qing Yi, in midair.

Zhu Lian inquired about the incense offerings at the Zhongyue Shrine on the mountain peak. Chen Ping’an replied that they hadn’t gone in to burn incense; they had only taken a stroll around the top. However, along the way up, they passed several Taoist temples and monasteries, which were evidently competing fiercely for worshippers. The Taoist temple had invited a high-ranking official from the Cheng Tian Kingdom to erect a stele at its gate, while the monastery had hired a famous calligrapher to write its plaque. Furthermore, they had made the mountain paths leading to their respective temples exceptionally flat and shaded by lush trees.

The situation was similar at the various mountains, but the competition between the Five Great Mountains of the country was even more intense, with all sorts of tactics employed. Deities of the mountains often invited cultivators from the Middle Five Realms to come and practice, even if they didn’t show up in person, as long as the thatched huts remained, it was said that “the mountain need not be high; where there are immortals, it is spiritual.” They would also warmly invite literati and poets to visit their mountain and leave behind poems and calligraphy, which would later be promoted by secular dynasties, and so on—there were countless schemes. It was said that in the South Mountain of the Cheng Tian Kingdom, a famous scholar later known as the Banana Scholar wrote a widely acclaimed poem while taking refuge from the rain, which was highly regarded by the vice-master of the Guan Hu Academy and included in a poetry collection as the concluding piece. Even a century later, the South Mountain Shrine still benefited from this “literary aura.”

Chen Ping’an wasn’t particularly fond of these businesses that had nothing to do with immortal energy, but he didn’t oppose them either. 

He thought that if one day he were to establish a small sect back in his hometown of Longquan County, he might have to emulate some of these methods.

Before boarding the flying boat, Zhu Lian softly suggested, “Young Master, would you like me to show a bit of my skill? With Pei Qian having acquired such a valuable piece of luminous stone, it’s inevitable that some may covet it.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head and laughed, saying, “As of now, we haven’t caused any trouble, nor are we unable to handle ordinary rogue spirits. There’s no reason for good people to guard against thieves every night. If someone truly comes knocking on our door, you, Zhu Lian, can just act as a protector for the people.”

Shi Rou, rarely speaking up, chimed in, “But we do possess a treasure, which might attract greedy eyes.”

Chen Ping’an patiently explained, “You’re mistaken. First, the desire to seize wealth and the intent to kill for it is inherently wrong. Second, while it may seem that we are guilty of having wealth and thus attracting envy, that’s not the case. It’s the evil in their hearts that comes first. Today they see the luminous stone, tomorrow they’ll covet what other treasures we might have, and the day after they’ll target someone else's fortune. That will always be their reason to take risks and ignore the law.”

He elaborated on the sequence of thoughts, breaking down his reasoning until Shi Rou nodded in agreement.

Chen Ping’an finally smiled and said, “The martial world is already murky enough; let’s not blame the good people further. Criticizing the virtuous in the Spring and Autumn period was a wise intention from the sage, but it’s not something we can blindly apply in our times.”

Zhu Lian, grinning, asked Pei Qian, “Do you understand?”

Pei Qian glared, “Why do you care?!”

Zhu Lian clucked his tongue, “The poor girl finally stepped in dog poop but ended up making a fortune; her backbone is stiffer than a walking stick now.”

The flying boat slowly ascended.

Pei Qian sat beside Chen Ping’an, struggling to suppress her laughter.

Zhu Lian continued, “Why not buy a few more pieces of luminous stone… take a gamble? For example, you have three remaining snowflake coins; if worse comes to worst, let Shi Rou sell that small luminous stone. It’s a small risk for a big profit. With that, you could strike it rich in this auspicious place! Not to mention, not just this year’s birthday gift for your master, but possibly for next year and the year after as well…”

Pei Qian held up two fingers, her face full of pride.

Zhu Lian smiled, “Please, enlighten me; I’m all ears.”

Pei Qian imitated Chen Ping’an’s slow tone, “First, on the way out of the Lion Garden, my master taught me that a gentleman doesn’t take away what others cherish, so I won’t have Shi Rou sell the luminous stone. Second, when traversing the martial world, one must know when to withdraw! This is also what my master taught.”

Zhu Lian clasped his hands together, “I’ve learned much! I wonder when the great hero Pei will open a school to impart teachings; I will definitely support it.”

Pei Qian raised her fist to threaten Zhu Lian playfully. When she saw the old chef remain unfazed, she reluctantly withdrew her fist, “Old chef, why are you so childish?”

Zhu Lian retaliated with a fist of his own.

Pei Qian leaned back just in time to dodge, bursting into laughter.

Zhu Lian exchanged smiles with Chen Ping’an.

Shi Rou, after all, wasn’t just a pure warrior; she didn’t fully grasp the subtleties of their banter.

Once they boarded the ferryboat, the rumors of “a young sword cultivator with two life-bound flying swords” were far more intimidating than the allure of the three snowflake coins. Thus, until the ferry left the Cheng Tian Kingdom, no rogue dared to test the waters with the sword cultivator.

However, the slow speed of this ferryboat, the meandering route, and various money-making schemes truly amazed Chen Ping’an.

On this day, as the ferryboat hovered and the flying boat cast a net toward a celestial residence, Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but exclaim, “We’ve truly boarded a pirate ship!”

This celestial sect, while only a third-rate one in the Baoping Continent, had built a long, single-log bridge spanning over ten miles between two peaks, permanently elevated above the sea of clouds. The scenery was pleasant, but the toll was also quite hefty, as it cost a full three snowflake coins to cross. It was said that a wild cultivator from the Fengwei Ferry once crossed this log bridge and witnessed the sunrise, which enlightened him, leading him to break through to the Golden Core Earth Immortal realm right there. Taking that single step allowed him to achieve great success later in life, despite starting as a lowly wild cultivator on the Baoping Continent.

Chen Ping’an obediently handed over twelve snowflake coins.

Pei Qian initially thought she could make several trips back and forth, but a fortunate young maid who had climbed the mountain to cultivate reminded everyone that this log bridge had a rule: one could not turn back after crossing.

This left Pei Qian stamping her feet in frustration—she had lost money, hadn’t she?!

Though called a log bridge, it was far from narrow or difficult to traverse.

The bridge the wild cultivator had taken back then was indeed shabby and run-down.

Later, with funds from the sect, it had been rebuilt to its current scale, wide and stable, not to mention exquisitely beautiful.

Afterward, the ferryboat wound its way through the war-torn central Baoping Continent, taking a genuinely long detour.

As a result, beneath the ferryboat’s hull lay the same Dragon Road Chen Ping’an had once sailed down south.

That time, Chen Ping’an had parted ways with Zhang Shan Feng and Xu Yuan Xia, heading south alone.

This time, he was accompanied by Pei Qian, Zhu Lian, and Shi Rou.

During their time on the ferryboat, apart from practicing his stances, Chen Ping’an had to devote half of his time to meditating, drawing in spiritual energy to nourish the “Water Mansion.”

The longer he embarked on the path of cultivation, the more he felt the repercussions of balancing martial arts and qi training. Chen Ping’an roughly concluded that this path would grant him a brief period of advantage when he reached the seventh realm of martial arts and the cave-dwelling realm as a qi cultivator. However, beyond that, especially after refining his life-bound item and eventually forming the Golden Core, the conflicts between the two pursuits would only become increasingly irreconcilable, making the ascent in martial arts riddled with obstacles and making it exceedingly difficult to advance to the Yuan Ying stage.

But those concerns belonged to the future.

For now, he still had to practice his fists and devote his utmost effort to absorbing and refining the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

After completing one million punches with the foundational six-step stance at the Great Wall of Sword Qi, Chen Ping’an had practiced nearly four hundred thousand punches since leaving the Upside Down Mountain to Tongye Continent, then to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, to the Great Spring Dynasty, Qing Hu Palace, and the southernmost Old Dragon City of the Baoping Continent, and now traveling north from the southeastern Qing Luan Kingdom to the Great Sui.

After the Qing Yi ferryboat faded into the distance.

In the early summer, they entered the sweltering heat of July, and three old men climbed the mountain to reach this log bridge.

Tourists were sparse.

Aside from the women collecting tolls at both ends of the bridge, there were almost no other patrons on it.

One of the old men, short and clad in coarse clothing, had a rather bandit-like appearance. Although he was the shortest, his presence was undeniably strong. He slapped the shoulder of a fellow old man traveling with him, “Xun, why are you dawdling? Pay up!”

The Xun surname elder was busy inquiring about the unique features of this scenic spot with the young maid. After being patted on the shoulder, he immediately fawned over her and took out nine snowflake coins, playing the part of a fool.

The old man digging into his pockets was none other than the Xun senior Zhu Lian often spoke of, who had gifted him several novels about celestial fights at the Old Dragon City’s pharmacy.

Zhu Lian held this elder in high regard and admired his vast knowledge.

Following him was the elder's destination, the Yu Gui Sect in Tongye Continent. After the previous master Du Mao failed in his ascension, the sect was gravely weakened, but the Yu Gui Sect had since risen to become the undisputed leader of the continent.

Another plain-looking elder hesitated, wanting to counsel his boisterous old friend. After all, Elder Xun had made the trip across continents to visit him; how could he give him the cold shoulder? Did he truly see this elder as just a junior of the Invincible God Fist Gang? Moreover, if it weren't for Elder Xun's timely aid, how could he have smoothly obtained the largest piece of the shattered glass golden body left behind by Du Mao?

To put it another way, Elder Xun was ultimately a great cultivator of the celestial realm from Tongye Continent and the old sect master of the Yu Gui Sect! Where did this guy, who had fallen back to the Yuan Ying realm, find the confidence to treat this elder so casually every day?

This elder was, in fact, the wild cultivator from Fengwei Ferry at the upper five realms, and also Jiang Yun’s master.

So this log bridge had once served as a blessed land for the old man when he formed his Golden Core.

The young maid, a mere third realm cultivator, couldn't tell the depth of these three individuals; it wouldn’t matter if she stood here—even the mountain master of the Sea Viewing realm wouldn’t be able to discern their true identities.

One was a celestial realm cultivator, another was a Jade Talisman realm cultivator, and the last was a Yuan Ying realm cultivator.

Any one of them could probably cause the mountain to tremble.

After paying the toll, the three old men slowly walked across the log bridge.

In terms of age and cultivation, Elder Xun was the most esteemed.

Yet, in front of the jade-faced young lord of Baoping Continent, the Tongye Continent’s one-foot spear simply couldn’t assert itself.

Once, while watching the same fleeting scene, the young lord inexplicably asked if the one-foot spear was capable of fighting. If it could, he would offer some help.

Elder Xun patted his chest, assuring him that even if it couldn't fight, it wouldn’t hold them back.

Then, as a qi cultivator, the leader of the Invincible God Fist Gang gave Elder Xun an address to meet up at.

Elder Xun then directly rode the wind, moving at an astonishing speed.

The result was a clash between a newly ascended celestial lord from the Divine Proclamation Sect and a Jade Talisman realm wild cultivator at the Fengwei Ferry, both of whom strove to obtain that piece of the shattered glass golden body, leading to a deadlock.

Unless something unexpected happened, regardless of how the outcome unfolded, it was certain that the Invincible God Fist Gang and the Divine Proclamation Sect would have a grudge against each other.

However, once Elder Xun appeared, he immediately broke the stalemate.

In a manner that could be described as a win-win, the Jade Talisman realm wild cultivator purchased that rare piece of glass golden body, nearly exhausting his life savings. It was evident that the nominal top cultivator of Baoping Continent, the celestial lord Qi Zhen, took a significant step back, only accepting payment. Moreover, Elder Xun assisted the Divine Proclamation Sect in retrieving the ancient and unknown shattered cave realm site where that piece of the glass golden body had escaped to, allowing it to be taken back to the sect for repairs. If managed well, it could become a small blessed land for disciples to cultivate.

Generally speaking, upper five realm cultivators wouldn’t easily enter fragments of cave blessed lands, but there are no absolutes.

Moreover, among the Confucian sages of the Hao Ran world, there were special sages dedicated to “expanding territories,” seeking out those ruins drifting at the bottom of the rivers of time. Once salvaged, they would either stabilize them as new cave blessed lands or gradually merge them into the territory of the Hao Ran world.

Many Confucian sages have completely fallen into the rivers of time throughout history, and countless others have suffered losses to their Dao’s foundation because of this.

And yet, these dangers and sacrifices remain unknown to the world.

After Li Huai arrived at the Great Sui Mountain Cliff Academy to study, although he was bullied at first, the storm eventually passed. Not only did no one in the academy bother him anymore, but he also made two new friends, both of whom were his peers: one was a prodigious child from a cold clan named Liu Guan, and the other was Ma Lian, born into a prominent family of the Great Sui.

The impoverished Liu Guan was audacious, often coming up with outlandish ideas, while the well-off Ma Lian was rather timid, often too afraid to do anything, becoming their little follower, sticking close to Liu Guan and Li Huai. Due to Ma Lian's family being among the foremost noble families of the Great Sui, with ties to the Ge Yang Gao family, and being the legitimate grandson, he faced exclusion and mockery from other peers in the academy, being labeled a sycophant and a walking wallet.

As summer approached, the three classmates would sneak out to the lakeside for a breeze after the academy's curfew, risking being caught by their teacher and facing punishment of copying texts or standing in the corner.

Tonight, Liu Guan led the way, swaggering along like a teacher on patrol. Li Huai glanced around cautiously, while Ma Lian trudged behind with a distressed expression, his head hung low.

They successfully reached the lakeside, where Liu Guan kicked off his boots and dipped his feet into the cool water. Feeling slightly dissatisfied, he turned to one relieved companion and said, “Ma Lian, it’s so hot in summer. Isn’t your family known as the best at hiding fans in the capital? Just bring a few out for me and Li Huai when you get a chance. It would be nice to fan ourselves while studying.”

Ma Lian frowned, “My grandfather cherishes those fans; each one is his prized possession. He won’t give me any.”

Liu Guan rolled his eyes, “Then just steal a few fans that your grandfather doesn’t often use. If he finds out, do you think he’d really beat you to death?”

Ma Lian was on the verge of tears.

Li Huai intervened, “Forget it; Ma Lian is too timid. He can’t hide anything on his face. If he sneaks home to steal fans, he’ll probably give himself away the moment he steps through the door.”

Ma Lian nodded vigorously.

Liu Guan sighed, “What a waste of such a good background. Not daring to do this or that, Ma Lian, I see little future for you. Just look, your grandfather is the Minister of Revenue of the Great Sui, holding the title of Grand Scholar of the Wen Ying Hall. By the time it gets to your father, he’s only a regional governor, and your uncle, though a court official, is just a minor functionary. When it’s your turn to become an official, you’re probably only going to be a county magistrate.”

Ma Lian sighed, not arguing back. He neither had the courage to quarrel with Liu Guan nor could deny that Liu Guan was stating the truth.

Among the three of them, the teachers in the academy scolded Liu Guan the most, but everyone could see that the teachers had the highest expectations for him. Ma Lian was neither here nor there, slightly better than the perpetually bottom-ranking Li Huai.

Li Huai patted Ma Lian’s shoulder to comfort him, saying, “Being a county magistrate is still impressive. Back in my hometown, the highest official was a supervisor of the kiln, who couldn’t even wear an official cap, while now we finally have a county magistrate. Besides, no matter what level of officialdom you reach, aren’t we all friends?”

Ma Lian hastily assured, “I will always consider you my best friends.”

Liu Guan chuckled, “Then tell me, between me and Li Huai, who is your best friend?”

Ma Lian was momentarily speechless, unsure how to answer without offending anyone. Although he admired Liu Guan’s intelligence and decisiveness, deep down, he preferred spending time with Li Huai, who was easygoing and didn’t make him feel inadequate.

Li Huai laughed, dipped his feet into the water, then gasped as the cold hit him, exclaiming, “I’m second best! I won’t compete with Liu Guan for first place; he’s first in everything, anyway.”

Liu Guan pulled Li Huai into a headlock, laughing, “As if you could beat me!”

Li Huai quickly pleaded for mercy, “I can’t, I can’t! Liu Guan, why compete with the bottom of the class?”

Ma Lian chuckled quietly.

The three kids were, after all, enjoying their carefree youth.

Suddenly, a furious yell from a nearby teacher broke the moment. Liu Guan shoved Li Huai and Ma Lian, “You two run first! I’ll hold that drunkard Han down!”

Without a second thought, Ma Lian bolted, still barefoot.

Li Huai picked up Ma Lian’s boots, asking, “What about you?”

Liu Guan widened his eyes, “Run quickly! If we all get caught together, it’ll be worse; the punishment will be even heavier!”

Li Huai hurriedly put on his boots, running more cautiously than Ma Lian, as he had walked all the way from Longquan County to the Great Sui Academy.

In the end, Liu Guan bore the brunt of the night patrol’s fury alone. Had he not answered the questions correctly, the teacher might have made him stand at the lakeside all night.

When Liu Guan returned to the dormitory, Li Huai opened the door and asked, “How did it go?”

Liu Guan snapped his fingers proudly, “There’s nothing in this world that Liu Guan can’t solve.”

Li Huai, ever observant, asked, “Aren’t you left-handed?”

Liu Guan immediately cursed, sitting at the table with his palm open, revealing that his left hand was already red and swollen. He grumbled, “That old drunkard Han must have been in a bad mood; the wine prices in the capital must have risen, or his two good-for-nothing sons caused trouble again, and he took it out on me. He used the ruler especially hard today.”

Liu Guan was carefree and could fall asleep anywhere. While Li Huai and Ma Lian anxiously worried about the consequences for tomorrow, Liu Guan was already in deep slumber.

Liu Guan lay at the outer edge of the straw mat, with Li Huai’s bedding against the wall and Ma Lian sandwiched in the middle.

Li Huai, unable to sleep, propped himself against the wall, holding a painted puppet and muttering to himself.

Ma Lian quietly asked, “Li Huai, why haven’t you played with Li Baoping lately?”

Li Huai casually replied, “I’ve been afraid of her since childhood. Besides, what’s the point of always playing with one girl? If people misunderstand that I like Li Baoping, I’ll definitely get beaten half to death by her.”

Ma Lian responded with an “oh,” feeling a bit dejected.

He thought that the girl in the red cotton robe was really pretty.

If he could just catch a glimpse of her from a distance at the academy one day, it would make his entire day.

After a long silence, while Li Huai continued to play with the puppet, pretending to be a commander, Ma Lian suddenly asked, “Li Huai, that Chen Ping’an you often mention, why hasn’t he come to see you after almost three years at the academy?”

Li Huai paused his actions, lost in thought for a moment before smiling, “He’s busy.”

Ma Lian realized that Li Huai had quickly laid down on the cool mat, placing the painted puppet beside his head. Normally, Li Huai could play with it for over half an hour, but today was an exception.

Li Huai, however, was staring out the window at the moonlight.

In his green bamboo box, there was a pair of straw sandals, a jade hairpin engraved with “Huai Yin,” and a book titled *The Great Cliff of Broken Water*, which Chen Ping’an had given him money to buy.

And then there was this painted puppet, along with the exquisite wooden box, acquired from the Land God Wei Bo at Qizhuang Mountain. The puppet was Li Huai’s number one general.

On a piece of paper, there was a character that Mr. Qi had asked them to copy back in the day; however, they either lost it or left it at their homes, leaving only Li Huai with it by chance. During their travels, Li Huai wanted to gift it to Chen Ping’an, who turned it down but asked Li Huai to keep it safe.

So, Li Huai had tucked it into the book *The Great Cliff of Broken Water*.

There were also a set of vividly crafted clay figurines gifted by Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple. They weren't as grand or imposing as the painted puppet; the five clay figurines stood only half a finger tall, depicting a wandering swordsman, a dust-brushing Daoist, an armored general, a woman riding a crane, and a drum-beating town crier, each named after some general or another.

The flying swordsman had once said some words that Li Huai had long forgotten. Something about the Yin-Yang family, the Mo family’s puppet techniques, and the Daoist talismans, and how the cultivators of the seven or eight realms were like that. Back then, Li Huai had only cared about having fun, paying no attention to such chaotic matters. Later, when introducing the clay figurines to his two friends, he wanted to brag about their value but couldn't come up with anything worthwhile. Eventually, he thought that since Chen Ping’an had promised to come visit him at the academy, he would ask him when he arrived. After all, Chen Ping’an remembered everything.

But it seemed that Chen Ping’an had forgotten about them.

At first, he would write letters to Li Baoping and send scrolls, but later he seemed to have stopped even the letters.

————

Compared to Li Huai and his two peers’ playful antics, Lin Shouyi was already recognized as a prodigy at the Mountain Cliff Academy.

He balanced both scholarly pursuits and cultivation, gaining the favor of many teachers in the academy.

He had early on followed a wise old immortal skilled in thunder techniques, traveling through the mountains and rivers of the Great Sui, splitting his time nearly evenly between the academy and the outside world.

The last person to have such treatment was the youngest sage of the Great Sui’s Guan Hu Academy, who was praised by the vice-master as the epitome of gentlemanly virtue.

As he grew older, Lin Shouyi transformed from a graceful young man into a charming young nobleman. The number of women who admired him, both in and out of the academy, increased dramatically. Many young ladies from the foremost families in the capital of the Great Sui would specifically visit the academy built atop Xiaodong Mountain just for a glimpse of Lin Shouyi.

Lin Shouyi gradually developed an ethereal quality that seemed to distance him from the mundane world.

As Lin Shouyi’s fame grew, reaching a pristine state akin to white jade, the influential figures in the Great Sui capital began to hear his name more frequently, whether discussing matters in government offices or conversing with their families.

Despite the attention and the various entanglements in daily life, Lin Shouyi, born a son of a bureaucrat’s concubine in Longquan County, exhibited neither arrogance nor annoyance.

Cultivating the heart was also a form of cultivation.

The more effort he put into refining his mindset yesterday and today, the fewer flaws he would have when breaking through in the future.

Due to his travels, Lin Shouyi had seen much of the political turbulence in the Great Sui. The once-thriving northern dynasty was now steeped in a melancholic atmosphere.

Yet, Lin Shouyi showed no interest in it.

Even the Great Li’s iron cavalry sweeping down south didn’t pique his concern.

Aside from studying the thunder techniques taught by the old teacher, he diligently delved into the *Clouds Above Langlang Book*, which he obtained from Qizhuang Mountain.

This time, he followed his teacher to the northern border of the Great Sui and a celestial cave known as Shenyao Mountain, spending three months there. For the first time, Lin Shouyi had boarded a celestial flying boat to closely observe a thundercloud, a breathtaking and awe-inspiring sight. The old teacher rode the winds, departing from the swaying boat and showcasing his ability to grasp lightning, collecting it in a specially crafted celestial porcelain bottle known as the Thunder Drum Bottle. He gifted it to Lin Shouyi for drawing in spiritual energy upon his return to the academy.

Tonight, Lin Shouyi was walking alone in the night, heading to the library to read books. The night watch teacher wouldn’t stop him; the Confucian academy had many rules but was not overly rigid.

Upon ascending the library, he lit a lamp and read until dawn.

Since becoming a qi cultivator, as long as he properly nourished his spirit, he could read all night without feeling tired.

After returning the books, Lin Shouyi approached the window, just in time to witness the heavy impurities of the world sinking, with the pure essence rising.

The world as seen through the eyes of a qi cultivator was vastly different from that of ordinary people.

Mortal eyes could not perceive the flow of spiritual energy, the rise of malevolent energy, the gathering of Yang energy, or the dispersal of Yin energy.

Yet, though the doors of ordinary cave dwellings were tightly shut, while they could not accept the refining and nourishing of spiritual energy for longevity, they were also sheltered from the various winds and tempests of the world, with life and death determined by fate.

Cui Dongshan once composed a poem that had Lin Shouyi yearning for more.

High winds and turbulent waves, riding the toad’s back for thousands of miles, wandering the heavenly palaces while gazing down at the misty haze. An immortal swaying the osmanthus tree while the world below calls it a gentle breeze.

After entering the academy, he perused the yellowed texts, hearing tales of ancient immortals who could visit the Day Palace and the Moon Palace, drinking divine brews with the gods and getting drunk for hundreds of years.

Lin Shouyi was filled with longing for this.

He suddenly sighed.

If that day ever came, he hoped that the willow-like woman would be by his side.

Upon thinking of her, Lin Shouyi couldn’t help but smile.

If the young ladies of the Great Sui capital saw this scene, they would surely be enraptured.

Over the years, Lin Shouyi occasionally reminisced about that naive journey during his youth, filled with adventure and novelty. It was the first time he encountered mountain spirits, the first time he met the land deities, the first time he obtained a chance to cultivate, the first time he stayed at an inn surrounded by immortal energy, and the first time he saw a painted guardian deity as tall as a person. It was also the first time he received a gift of a small book box and a jade hairpin. And the first time, in an unfamiliar place like the Great Sui Academy, he united with others against common adversities.

Lin Shouyi suddenly felt a pang of regret.

It seemed that after that person left, everyone scattered. Even though they still met at the same academy, the hearts of people had drifted apart.

A clear stream of water began to fork, flowing in different directions. Though they appeared to grow stronger and larger, like the joyous creek that became Li Huai, the mighty river that became himself, or the lake that became Li Baoping, waiting patiently, or the deep well that became Yu Lu, underground rivers; looking back, it was apparent that in the very beginning, they were all noisy, muddy, with bamboo boxes and straw sandals, braving the elements, some keeping watch at night…

Lin Shouyi sighed.

There was no turning back.

————

Initially, Yu Lu had no classmates living in his dormitory, but later a prince, Gao Xuan, moved in, and the two became inseparable, sharing a close bond.

However, not long ago, Yu Lu became a “lonely man” once again, as Gao Xuan quietly left the Mountain Cliff Academy to attend Lin Lu Academy on Piyun Mountain in Longquan County, claiming it was for study. The truth was evident to anyone with keen insight; it was merely a hostage situation. After the alliance between the Great Li’s Song family and the Great Sui’s Gao family, besides Gao Xuan, there was also a high-ranking official from the Gao family in the Great Sui capital, as well as an old dragon who had retired to the mountains in Huang Ting Kingdom, who together became the deputy mountain master of the newly established Lin Lu Academy.

Yu Lu sent Gao Xuan off at the foot of the academy but did not accompany him further.

This morning, Yu Lu, for the first time, knocked on the door of a secluded courtyard.

The person who opened the door was Xie Xie.

Yu Lu saw Xie Xie holding a broom.

Even though Cui Dongshan had left the academy for some time, it seemed she still diligently managed her duties as a maid every day.

Xie Xie, with a stern face, asked, “What do you want?”

Yu Lu smiled, “I suddenly realized it’s been a while since we last met, so I came to check in.”

Xie Xie inquired, “Now that you’ve seen me, what next?”

Yu Lu, feeling helpless, said, “How about a cup of tea? That’s not too much to ask, right?”

Xie Xie hesitated for a moment but still allowed Yu Lu, whom she should have respectfully addressed as Your Highness, to enter the courtyard.

The courtyard wasn’t large but was kept very clean. If autumn approached, bringing falling leaves, or if spring came early with flurries, it would be a lot of work.

Xie Xie pointed toward the main room, which was tightly shut, with a corridor beneath the eaves made of green bamboo, almost like a large mat for cooling off. Yu Lu could even imagine that white-clad youth with a mole on his forehead lazily lying here to watch the stars on cool nights.

Xie Xie reminded, “Remember to take off your shoes before stepping up the stairs. Otherwise, I’ll have to clean again after you leave.”

Yu Lu took off his boots, sitting on the bamboo floor, which was likely cultivated by some qi cultivator from a celestial residence in the Great Sui, a luxury even for the ordinary nobles of the Great Sui to make into writing brushes. It was quite proper for cultured gentlemen to gift each other such items. If there were a bamboo mat for summer or a bamboo chair for cooling off, that would be an extraordinary display of both incense and wealth, but here in this courtyard, it remained as it was.

Xie Xie continued with her chores, not pouring Yu Lu any tea. It was too early for tea; did he think he was still the Lu prince? Yu Lu was now less than Gao Xuan, who at least had the Gao family’s backing in the Great Sui. Compared to those Lu clan remnants sent to be laborers in the mountains west of Longquan County, enduring the harsh sun, wind, and rain all year round, often getting whipped, or worse, being sold off to serve as maids and servants in newly built residences, the disparities were vast.

Yu Lu reclined backward, asking, “Xie Xie, have you ever thought about what kind of life you want in the future?”

Xie Xie sat beside a stone table, “Never thought about it.”

Yu Lu, dressed in the academy’s Confucian robe, placed his hands on his abdomen, “Your young master gave me a beating before leaving the academy.”

Xie Xie scoffed, “What, can’t defeat that Cui Dongshan, so you want to use me as a punching bag? Truly impressive for a seven-realm warrior bearing half the kingdom’s martial fortunes. But are you certain you can win against me?”

Having been captured by Great Li, she had several dragon nails driven into crucial acupoints by a sword cultivator in the palace, which was exceptionally cruel.

Later, Cui Dongshan removed half of the dragon nails, restoring her to the cave-dwelling realm of qi cultivators. Before leaving the academy, Cui Dongshan pulled out a few more, leaving only the last nail that sealed her life-bound item acupoint. But at least she had returned to the Sea Viewing realm. Additionally, Cui Dongshan had set up many secret techniques in the small courtyard, most of which he taught Xie Xie to activate, control, and close. Thus, as long as she was in the courtyard, she had the rudiments of what it meant for Mao Xiaodong to guard the Mountain Cliff Academy.

Yu Lu sat up, smiling, “If we truly fought, you would still lose.”

Xie Xie responded with an indifferent “oh,” her expression flat, “Well, if you say so, then I must have misjudged you. Should I apologize?”

Yu Lu lay back down, using his hands as a pillow, and sighed, “You.”

Though they were both remnants of the Lu dynasty and should have supported each other in mutual suffering, Xie Xie deeply loathed this easygoing Yu Lu and didn’t bother to hide it.

Yu Lu closed his eyes, “It’s comfortable lying here; let me take a nap.”

Xie Xie hesitated but didn’t urge him to leave.

She was somewhat curious as to why Yu Lu hadn’t followed Gao Xuan to Lin Lu Academy.

If he had gone to Great Li, he could at least oversee the Lu clan remnants suffering from the harshness, and many Lu clan civil and military officials, though dependent on Great Li, were still valued and trusted. Many military officers even followed the Great Li cavalry south, reportedly achieving great success and gradually integrating into the Great Li military.

Even disregarding all that, Yu Lu was now a registered citizen of Great Li and a young warrior of the Golden Body realm.

If that were known, it would surely shock many.

The Great Li Emperor, for all else, lacked nothing in poise.

The Prince, Song Changjing, was the same.

In any case, it seemed Yu Lu should have gone to Lin Lu Academy.

But Yu Lu stubbornly stayed at the Mountain Cliff Academy.

Among those who entered the academy with him, Lin Shouyi had always stood out as the most promising, destined for the highest achievements, while the red cotton-robed girl, Li Baoping, was the most interesting and lovable, with no one disliking her. Xie Xie had the strongest backing, while Li Huai possessed the most mediocre aptitude for academics but was the most amiable. And Yu Lu remained the least noticed, easily forgotten, even after befriending Prince Gao Xuan, who still didn’t inspire anyone to pay attention to Yu Lu, merely viewing him as a young man who liked to climb the social ladder by befriending the powerful.

Yu Lu suddenly opened his eyes, “Your young master said Chen Ping’an is about to break through to the fifth realm of martial arts, and his true combat strength is even higher.”

Xie Xie, feeling a bit gloating, asked, “Are you afraid of being caught up?”

Yu Lu shook his head, “He will definitely catch up.”

Xie Xie frowned, “Soon?”

Yu Lu nodded, “Sooner than you can imagine.”

Xie Xie asked again, “Martial fortunes?”

Yu Lu shook his head, “Precisely because it has nothing to do with that, I feel somewhat… melancholic.”

Xie Xie couldn’t respond.

She couldn’t imagine what Chen Ping’an would be like next time they met.

Would he still be carrying his bamboo box, wearing straw sandals, just taller?

Li Baoping also lived alone in her dormitory.

This was the only matter on which Mao Xiaodong and Cui Dongshan, two sworn enemies, had never clashed.

Since the dormitory was meant for four, it was expected that the red cotton-robed girl would have an empty room. 

But in reality, aside from her own bed, the other three were filled to the brim with stacks of papers, neatly arranged.

As a result, the teacher had to complain to several heads of the academy that the girl had finished copying enough texts to be punished over a hundred times; what else could they do?

The night-watch teachers were left in a state of amusement, as almost every night, they could see the girl copying texts under her lamp, her brush flying across the page in diligent fervor.

At first, some of the older teachers felt sorry for the girl, mistakenly believing that the colleagues responsible for teaching Li Baoping were being overly harsh. They grumbled privately about it, but the answer was quite ridiculous: those teachers claimed this was just the girl’s preference; she didn’t need to copy so many classics. Li Baoping occasionally skipped classes to dawdle on Xiaodong Mountain or sneaked out of the academy to wander, and afterward, according to the academy's rules, she would indeed be punished to copy texts, but she didn’t require that many. The problem was that the girl enjoyed copying texts. How could they stop her? Other students in the academy, particularly those with more rebellious temperaments, were forced to copy texts with rulers and rods, while this girl somehow ended up copying an entire mountain of books.

Fortunately, this well-known girl in the academy, while sometimes skipping class and annoying the teachers, was still quite endearing. Of course, apart from those odd questions she often posed, which left the teachers scratching their heads. How could a little head hold so many bizarre ideas? Why do all rivers in the world like to twist and turn? Do you know the answer, teacher? When it rains heavily, will the mosquitoes outside the dormitory be smashed by raindrops? Do you know, teacher? I searched the ground for a long time after the rain and didn’t find a single mosquito corpse! Why don’t those fish in the lake die even after drinking so much water? You don’t know either, right? That’s not mentioned in the books; I can just go turn the pages myself…

As a result, the teachers who taught the girl often found themselves in a bind, jokingly wondering if it was time to compile a collection of Li Baoping’s questions.

Today, Li Huai, for some inexplicable reason, didn’t follow Liu Guan and Ma Lian. He claimed he needed to use the restroom and wandered to the top of Xiaodong Mountain alone.

Coincidentally, he indeed spotted the familiar figure in a red skirt perched on a tree branch—Li Baoping.

Li Huai didn’t dare to greet her and lay on the stone table at the mountain peak, gazing at the girl who often came here to climb trees.

After a while, Li Baoping, having daydreamed enough, skillfully wrapped her arms around the tree trunk, slid down to the ground, and took off running.

She caught sight of Li Huai, who was raising his hand but unable to utter a word.

Li Baoping merely glanced at Li Huai, then turned away, her feet flying as she dashed down the mountain.

Li Huai felt a mix of resentment and grievance, so he found a stick on the ground and started doodling.

Suddenly, Li Huai’s eyes lit up; he remembered last time he wrote about his parents, and they indeed came to visit him at the academy.

So, would writing Chen Ping’an’s name work too?

Li Huai grinned and began writing the characters for Chen Ping’an.

Before he could finish, a hand unexpectedly appeared and wiped away the nearly completed characters.

Li Huai was baffled, realizing it was Li Baoping, who had somehow returned.

Li Huai, feeling petulant, wrote the first character again, only for Li Baoping to wipe it away once more.

In the past, Li Huai might have backed down, but today, emboldened as if he had taken a bear’s heart and a leopard’s gall, he stubbornly started writing again.

Li Baoping said nothing, simply reached out to erase the characters as he wrote.

By the time Li Huai broke that stick, he still hadn’t managed to write out a single complete character of “Chen,” let alone the following “Ping An.”

Li Huai threw down the broken stick and began to sob.

Li Baoping ignored him and picked up the stick, continuing to squat and write the characters for “Little Master Uncle.” After finishing, she nodded in satisfaction.

Li Huai hastily wiped his face and sniffled, “Li Baoping, if you keep bullying me like this, I’ll tell Chen Ping’an when he arrives! If he gets angry, he might not want to be your little master uncle anymore!”

Li Baoping changed her handwriting and continued writing “Little Master Uncle,” concentrating on the ground, completely ignoring Li Huai’s threat.

Suddenly, Li Huai forced a smile and cautiously asked, “Li Baoping, could you just let me write three characters? It’ll surely work! Chen Ping’an might really come to our academy tomorrow. I’m not lying; last time I thought of my parents, and they came after I wrote about them, as you know.”

Li Baoping didn’t lift her head, simply handing over the stick again.

Li Huai, overjoyed, barely set the stick to the ground when Li Baoping suddenly frowned, “Focus on writing!”

Li Huai was startled, causing his hand to tremble, and immediately scribbled something unrecognizable, “What are you doing?!”

Li Baoping helped him erase the marks.

Li Huai broke into a smile and began to earnestly write the character “Chen.”

Once finished, Li Baoping looked around, asking, “Where is he?”

Li Huai pulled a long face, “How could it happen so quickly?”

Li Baoping sprang up and dashed toward the large tree, standing on a branch and scanning the surroundings.

Li Huai’s eyes darted, knowing something was wrong; he tossed the stick aside and started to run.

But he couldn’t outrun Li Baoping, who quickly caught up with him after leaping down from the tree, and he crouched down, hugging his head in fright.

This time, however, to his surprise, Li Baoping didn’t hit him. Instead, she ran along the mountain path all the way toward the academy’s gate to explore the streets and alleys of the Great Sui capital.

As Li Baoping wildly roamed the capital, Li Huai, relieved to escape, returned to the dormitory.

At the Mountain Cliff Academy’s gate.

A weary-looking group of four approached—a young man in white, carrying a sword and a bamboo box, smiling as he handed a travel document to an elderly scholar at the gate.

The old scholar examined it for a long time, noting the numerous seals from various nations and regions on the two continents, filling his heart with astonishment. He looked up and smiled, “This young Master Chen has traveled to so many places!”

The young man visiting the academy nodded with a smile.
