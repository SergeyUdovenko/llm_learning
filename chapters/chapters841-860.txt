 **Chapter 841: A Startling Shock to the Vast World (Part 1)**

For a few years, Zhu Lian had been secretly toiling away in Clearwind City, and in the end, he managed to pry away a fox kingdom. When Zhu Lian returned to Ruined Mountain with Pei Xiang, they just happened to be caught between Jun Qian descending the mountain and those entering the mountain from the sides.

The lord of Clearwind City, Xu Hun, had only recently departed from the Ascension Platform. Xu Hun had once been celebrated alongside the sword cultivator Huang He of the Wind and Thunder Garden as one of the "most lethal under the upper five realms" in the Baoping Continent. Now that he had ascended to the upper five realms, he was as steady as ever, yet it was hard for him to suppress a sense of pride. Instead of returning to Clearwind City, he boarded a military ferry from the Great Li Kingdom at the Niu Jiao Mountain crossing, heading to the battlefield at Old Dragon City as per the arrangement made at the Ascension Platform.

Then, Xu Hun received a message via flying sword. On the ferry, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted, a dense murderous intent that spread out like a tide, enveloping the boat. The practitioners from the Baoping Continent aboard the ferry possessed unique identities, prompting a rogue from the Mo family, sword held behind him, to quietly leave the imperial capital of the Great Li Kingdom. This trip was specifically to escort the ferry south. Just as Xu Hun could no longer contain the overwhelming aura of the upper five realms, causing the entire ferry to tremble, they swept past the Sea of Clouds, scattering white clouds in all directions.

Xu Ruo maintained his usual demeanor. One hand circled behind him as he practiced a unique "Sword Grip Technique" he had derived from observing an ancient painting of a sword immortal from Shu. He gently pushed the sword out of its sheath by an inch, instantly suppressing Xu Hun's aura.

The ranger Xu Ruo shook his head at a ferry steward from the Great Li military, indicating that there was no need for alarm. Xu Hun's actions could be noted, but there was no need to pursue accountability at this moment.

After a while, Xu Hun, who had always donned a suit of armor with a prominent wart, appeared at the bow of the ship, taking the initiative to apologize to the ferry steward and then expressing his gratitude to Xu Ruo.

Xu Ruo simply smiled and said it was no trouble, just a minor issue.

Returning to his cabin, Xu Hun appeared to have regained his composure. The military general among the Great Li troops, who hailed from Zhenwu Mountain, noted that Zhenwu Mountain and the Snow Temple, two ancestral homes of military families in the Baoping Continent, had the best relations with the Mo family, thanks to their shared principles and mutual respect.

The armored general quietly asked, "Xu, could it be that something significant has happened in Clearwind City to cause an upper five realm cultivator to lose composure like that?"

Xu Ruo nodded. "It’s most likely due to that fox kingdom. We needn't concern ourselves; we have spies keeping an eye on it."

The foundation of Clearwind City lay with the fox kingdom, especially in terms of making money. Although the city lord Xu Hun held a high position, he was surprisingly simple and unpretentious about matters of romance and spending. Of course, Xu Hun's wife was quite capable of making money and enjoying life. In the bureaucracy of the Great Li capital, opinions on Xu Hun were mixed.

Xu Ruo sighed, feeling somewhat regretful. Earlier, he had learned of a momentous secret from National Teacher Cui Zhan but had been unable to break free in time to meet the poet and sword immortal Bai Ye.

After Zhu Lian returned to Ruined Mountain, he immediately gathered Wei Ban, Mi Yu, and Wei Wendong to discuss several important matters that very night.

The butler, the allied mountain lord, the sword immortal who served them, and the Golden Core qi cultivator who handled finances and accounts all came from different paths of cultivation and different hometowns, yet they ultimately converged at Ruined Mountain.

Zhu Lian, the chief steward of Ruined Mountain, was meeting Mi Yu and Wei Wendong for the first time, yet during this meeting, he treated them as if they were familiar friends.

The group sat around the stone table in Zhu Lian’s courtyard. Wei Ban waved his sleeve, and four jars of Longchun Palace wine appeared on the table, accompanied by four replicas of the "Li" character cups from the Twelve Flower Gods. According to rumors from the foot of the mountain, these were typical "official imitations," meaning the four little wine cups, which had originated from the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land, were worth much more than the four jars of Spring Flower Brew. Those nocturnal feasts were not held for nothing; Wei Ban had scavenged quite a few treasures from the celestial realm.

Zhu Lian said, "Tonight is just a small gathering; no one should drink too much."

Wei Ban raised his sleeve again, as if he were about to collect the wine. Zhu Lian quickly reached out to cover the wine jar in front of him. "A little drink adds to the merriment; it won’t do to not drink."

Wei Ban smiled and said, "Let's discuss the serious matters."

Wei Wendong had been carefully examining one of the wine cups, estimating its value in his mind, but upon hearing Wei Ban's words, he quickly focused.

Zhu Lian took a sip of wine and set down his cup, gently twisting the exquisitely crafted porcelain cup with his fingers. 

The first matter at hand was to inquire when the mountain lord would return to the Vast World and whether he could indeed return home.

Zhu Lian had prepared for the worst, even bracing himself for a scolding from Wei Ban. 

However, he received excellent news—not a definitive answer, but rather that Mi Yu said a certain Mr. Liu, who was the senior brother of the Hidden Official, was rather confident about this matter. While he couldn't guarantee that the junior brother would definitely return, there was hope for survival. As long as there was a glimmer of hope, they, as seniors, would plot and plan, whether through sword or fist, to secure that chance for their junior brother.

Zhu Lian said, “The three disturbances in the sky above the North Yue region were truly astonishing. What excellent martial arts! Truly impressive martial arts.”

However, this wasn't that Zhu Lian disrespected Jun Qian; rather, his views on martial arts and boxing were always somewhat peculiar. In Zhu Lian's eyes, compared to Cui Cheng's boxing intent, although Jun Qian's boxing also reached for the heavens, its intent still descended from above. Thus, Zhu Lian continued to hold greater admiration for the martial artist Cui Cheng. Just like Ding Ying, who, according to Young Master and Zhong Qiu, faced the heavens until his dying breath, it was indeed impressive and could be described as domineering. Yet Zhu Lian even felt that even if the heavens stood before him, they would still be the heavens, just as Cui Cheng praised the principle of boxing: before a martial artist, there should be no equal.

Otherwise, even if Ding Ying found refuge elsewhere in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he would still have a future life, where his boxing would rise to a new level. Even if he cultivated celestial techniques to enhance his boxing, no matter how high his boxing intent became, he would merely be a marionette.

Zhu Lian gathered his thoughts and began discussing the second matter.

This concerned the choices Ruined Mountain would have to make if the mountain lord had not returned in the coming years.

How to interact with the Great Li Song Clan, which was essentially a nation and a continent.

Regarding this, Wei Ban remained silent. No matter how close they were to Ruined Mountain, it would be inappropriate to speak. Unless Zhu Lian and the others discussed it and there was a significant divergence from Wei Ban's views. However, Zhu Lian wouldn’t make a foolish move. In chess, Zhu Lian was quite skilled and matched Wei Ban in prowess. Although both were slightly inferior to Zheng Dafeng, they were still significantly better than Cui Dongshan. Zhu Lian never deliberately pursued divine moves, a quality that even Zheng Dafeng acknowledged.

Mi Yu, on the other hand, felt guilty. He had spent his time on Ruined Mountain snacking with Xiao Mi Li and was now feeling a bit apprehensive.

Fortunately, Wei Wendong was there, not disappointing Mi Yu.

Wei Wendong and Zhu Lian reached a conclusion together: they should divide their approach. The way to interact with the Great Li Song Clan should be somewhat different from their dealings with the Great Li dynasty.

Zhu Lian proposed a plan.

All ferries at the Niu Jiao Mountain crossing would not charge a single snowflake as docking fees, and the spiritual energy loss from Niu Jiao would be solely borne by Ruined Mountain.

Wei Ban suggested a fifty-fifty split. Zhu Lian rubbed his hands, a flattering smile directed at Wei Ban, just as he was about to speak, Wei Ban decisively stated that fifty-fifty was the only way, with no room for negotiation.

The honorable Wei Ban, with sleeves of clean wind… joyful events continued in the North Yue, with a few nocturnal feasts thrown in, smashing pots and selling iron to bring fine wines down the mountain…

Zhu Lian thought of some rumors that could even be heard in Clearwind City and felt that managing a large family business like Wei Ban's must not be easy, so he stopped haggling.

The most unfortunate were those who had barely slipped away to the Middle Yue region to avoid trouble and just happened to bump into Mountain Lord Jin Qing, who was also hosting nocturnal feasts.

After some consideration, Zhu Lian proposed an idea: after throwing out all the operating costs and miscellaneous expenses of Ruined Mountain, all profits related to the Great Li military and battlefield supplies, even if procured from Ruined Mountain and transferred to the border troops, would be forfeited. Furthermore, Ruined Mountain would also negotiate with all allied peaks in the southeastern line of North Julu Continent, including the Pima Sect, Chunlu Garden, Cloud City, and Caizhu Mansion, to appropriately lower prices. On the premise of ensuring no losses, they would earn less, or even nothing.

Wei Ban said, "Repaying favors is more troublesome than borrowing money from immortals and paying it back. I think Ruined Mountain should digest this debt itself and not involve our trade allies. Either that... or the Pima Sect and Chunlu Garden should take the initiative to speak up, and then we’ll remember their favors. I say this because you’ve been away from the mountain for years; Ruined Mountain still has a bit of spare cash. Not to mention various sources of income, just the trip to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land back to Tongye Continent under Jiang Shangzhen’s management didn’t just avoid losses but even made a profit. Wei Wendong, report the accounts for Ruined Mountain."

Wei Wendong calculated the accounts for the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, and Jiang Shangzhen indeed had a knack for making money. Wei Wendong was now quite admiring of this named offering from Ruined Mountain and felt he would love to chat with him.

Zhu Lian smiled and said, "No wonder, which mountain peak provides offerings that not only don't charge but also scrambles to give money?"

The expenditures for the members of the Ancestor Hall at Ruined Mountain could truly make many sects envious, as they all enjoyed subsidizing their own mountains.

Zhu Lian then asked with a smile, "Brother Wei, are we afraid of owing favors at Ruined Mountain? Are we lacking business partners? I don’t think so. Our dealings with others are for the sake of friendships that will last for hundreds or even thousands of years. In my view, whoever owes favors to whom can be discussed later. Therefore, can you allow me to make a unilateral decision on the price negotiation? Those unwilling to lower the price, apart from the Pima Sect, will have to leave it to the mountain lord to decide in the future. As for the others, like Chunlu Garden, closing the door and speaking our minds, even if our relationship grows distant, so what?"

Mi Yu finally nodded and spoke up, "I understand the atmosphere in North Julu Continent better. Besides, we haven’t made Chunlu Garden lose any money; we just aren’t making any. If they can’t accept that, haha."

Wei Ban pondered for a moment and nodded, "That works."

Zhu Lian then put forth another suggestion, which made even Mi Yu, who had a big heart, feel a bit tongue-tied.

Zhu Lian proposed to immediately lend out their ferry, the Ink Dragon Boat, for exclusive use by the Great Li border troops. From the outset, they would clearly state to the Great Li Dynasty, even signing a black-and-white agreement: if the ferry were to be destroyed in some battlefield one day, Ruined Mountain would treat it as if they had never owned that ferry, and the Great Li border troops would not need to pay a single snowflake.

Though Wei Wendong felt pained by this, he still said, "That’s fine!"

The third matter involved the merger of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land with the Iron Chain Well, linking the blessed land and cave heaven together.

Although that well was not truly a small cave heaven, it was nonetheless one of the "broken mountains and rivers" of the former Li Zhu Cave Heaven, which was itself one of the thirty-six small cave heavens.

This matter was brought up by Wei Ban, with Wei Wendong responsible for supplementing the details and numbers.

The great sword immortal Mi Yu was there to listen.

Three golden rains had caused the spiritual energy in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land to flourish, with mountains and rivers thriving exceptionally. In the four southern nations, everyone was astonished at how much rain had fallen this summer, while the cultivators and mountain spirits above were shocked at the "heavenly dew" beyond belief.

A Lotus Flower Blessed Land that had only recently reached the level of a medium blessed land—first with the immortal money earned by Jiang Shangzhen, and then with the three golden rains—suddenly approached the bottleneck of being classified as a medium blessed land. It seemed that just one more drop of Gu Yu money could elevate it to a high-grade blessed land. Once it reached that level, various auspicious signs would emerge between heaven and earth, and numerous heavenly materials and earthly treasures would be born. Many cultivation opportunities would arise, and at that time, the Lotus Flower Blessed Land would see an unimaginable surge in profits, turning Ruined Mountain’s losses into gains.

This was also why the golden spirit copper coins were more valuable than the Gu Yu, Xiaoshu, and Xiaoxue celestial coins.

Not only were they rarer and harder to forge, but the golden spirit copper coins could transform into the purest earthly spiritual energy while also containing the essence of divinity.

However, when Wei Ban spoke about inviting the sword immortal to explore the mountains and rivers and open up paths, Mi Yu suddenly appeared embarrassed. Being mocked by young sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall as "relying on looks to kill enemies and reach the upper five realms," or being dubbed the "first sword immortal of the Jade Purity Realm" had never made him feel as awkward as this.

The coexistence of blessed land and cave heaven required the sword immortal to carve out a path and stabilize the heavens and earth with sword energy. Thus, for the establishment and stabilization of the fifth realm, the Culture Temple of the Central Plains must invite Bai Ye out of seclusion, which was the reason behind it.

For an upper five realm sword cultivator, the depth of their sword intent, the quality of their swordsmanship, and the abundance of their spiritual energy were all tests.

Although Mi Yu had been a ruthless fighter with a sword against enemies when he was in the Earth Immortal realm, comparable to the likes of Nalan Caihuan and Qi Shou, and even considered a senior, this was why Yin Chen regarded Mi Yu with new eyes. Unfortunately, Mi Yu had never felt any joy from being seen as a kindred spirit by Yin Chen. However, after Mi Yu ascended to the Jade Purity Realm, he suddenly became indistinguishable from the masses at the Sword Qi Great Wall, even ranking at the bottom among upper five realm sword cultivators. He had once been a brother in hardship with the traitor sword immortal Lie Ji.

Mi Yu didn’t dare to casually speak on matters that involved the long-term interests of Ruined Mountain, only lamenting that if only Bai Ye had visited Ruined Mountain when Zhu Lian was present.

If Mi Yu couldn’t do it, then it was even less feasible for the saint of the Longquan Sword Sect, Ruan Qiong, to be trusted.

Thus, Wei Ban's idea was whether it was possible to invite the Mo family ranger Xu Ruo for assistance.

Mi Yu took a sip of his sorrowful wine. After arriving at Ruined Mountain, it seemed he hadn't accomplished a single serious task, and he murmured, “If only Left Sword Immortal were here.”

Wei Ban sighed, "Left Sir is currently in Tongye Continent, surrounded by formidable foes, so it's impossible for him to show up."

Thus, this matter was temporarily shelved.

Since it wasn’t urgent, there was no need to rush.

Zhu Lian took a sip of wine, smacking his lips in appreciation, “This is excellent wine! I’ll have to ask Wei Ban for a few dozen jars later,” he said, genuinely sighing, “Having Longming as a friend on the mountain is truly a blessing for us at Ruined Mountain.”

Wei Wendong's eyes lit up with excitement as he nodded vigorously, smiling, "Indeed, ever since Longming arrived at Ruined Mountain, our fortunes have skyrocketed. We’ve gone from being hand-to-mouth to having plenty to spare… I might even forget how to do arithmetic!"

Wei Ban said, "Next time we meet, let’s invite Longming."

Zhu Lian suddenly asked, "Are we sure we can trust her?"

Wei Ban replied, "Given the mountain lord's secret letter, and Longming's cautious nature, she even made a trip to Tongye Sect to ask Left Sir for a token."

Zhu Lian shook his head with a smile. "It’s my Young Master who worries that we might not trust Longming, which is why she’s taking such precautions."

Mi Yu felt that his little world had finally appeared, quickly downing a drink and exclaiming, “It must be so! The Hidden Official has always been a master at calculating strategies. In the Summer Palace and the Spring Banner Pavilion, that’s well acknowledged, and the one who organizes the hearts of the people is none other than an old fox. In the end, they’re all convinced. The targets of the Hidden Official’s schemes are not just the head of a great demon that fell into the sea!”

Wei Wendong lowered his head to drink. It was indeed not easy for Mi Yu to finally express his feelings.

Zhu Lian raised his cup, "Let’s toast to Mi Yu. One for welcoming the sword immortal, and one for my Young Master and the Hidden Official."

Mi Yu immediately filled a cup, taking the first toast. Then he poured another, but there was only half a cup left since today’s discussion had seen him speaking little and drinking a lot.
Zhu Lian had already raised his cup when he suddenly turned to complain, “Brother Wei, where’s the wine? How can we let Master Mi have only half a cup? Is that even reasonable?”

Wei Bo shot him a glance, thinking to himself, “You old chef, is this all part of your plan?” Consequently, four more jars of celestial brew appeared on the table.

Zhu Lian declared, “If Wei Mountain Lord has the audacity to collect wine fees, then I have the audacity not to pay!”

Wei Wenlong suddenly realized that this “old chef” had become surprisingly familiar with the atmosphere of Luoposhan, just like during his days at Chunfan Studio. Back then, it was only him, Yan Ming, and Nalan Caihuan in the account room, and the mood inevitably turned dreary. Even when Mi Yu sat outside, he would just stare blankly at the doorstep. Only when the young Hidden Official made an appearance would things change. The Hidden Official never tried to force a conversation; he simply spoke naturally and acted in ways that allowed things to flow effortlessly. Wei Wenlong didn’t want to emulate the Hidden Official because he knew he could never replicate that.

Zhu Lian slowly said, “I’ll first have a word with Daoist Changming, chat for a bit, and then see if we should all meet again next time.”

The fourth matter at hand was that Wei Bo took out three scrolls from his sleeve and returned them to Zhu Lian.

As for the details behind this transaction, Wei Bo wouldn’t share them with Wei Wenlong.

Whoever possessed these three scrolls essentially held the lifeblood of Lu Baixiang, Wei Xian, and Sui You. These three scrolls were handed over to Wei Bo by Zhu Lian before his journey to Qingfeng City, asking him to keep an eye on the scrolls’ strange phenomena, lest someone die and not return.

Chen Ping’an was willing to trust Zhu Lian, and Zhu Lian intended to honor that trust in his own son.

In fact, Wei Bo still had a fourth scroll, which represented Zhu Lian’s “life object” as a pure martial artist and also served as a “life-extending lamp.”

This particular scroll had been handed over to Wei Bo by Chen Ping’an long before his journey, stored in the Mountain Lord’s residence at Piyun Mountain, and Chen had initially explained the matter in front of both of them.

It wasn’t that Chen Ping’an didn’t trust Zhu Lian; it was simply a matter of rules. First and foremost, it was about Zhu Lian’s relationship with the other three, which could not be neglected. The three scrolls were in Zhu Lian’s hands because he was the chief steward of Luoposhan, and his status was already distinct from the other three. Thus, Zhu Lian’s scroll had to remain with the Mountain Lord, Chen Ping’an. 

On Luoposhan, each had their own paths and connections, and while some favoritism was unavoidable, it couldn’t go too far. For instance, Chen Ping’an naturally favored Pei Qian, Nuan Shu, and Xiao Mi Li, while he would be slightly distant from Cen Yuanji and Yuan Bao Yuanlai. However, all of Luoposhan’s established mountain rules, guidelines, and principles were rigid. For example, future matters regarding opportunities, distribution of heavenly materials and precious treasures, and how seniors would descend from the mountain to protect juniors—all had to follow the mountain rules. Chen Ping’an maintained this within Luoposhan, and even more so when he wasn’t on the mountain.

The fifth matter was the relocation of the Fox Kingdom from Qingfeng City and where they needed to be settled.

Zhu Lian invited everyone to speak their minds.

Mi Yu was essentially just a bystander, drinking while too lazy to think. Even if he tried to muster the energy to engage, he felt he couldn’t keep up with Zhu Lian and Wei Bo. It was better not to overexert himself.

That wasn’t his strong suit.

In the future, when the world was at peace, and the chaos had settled, that would be the perfect time for Mi Yu to showcase his talents and make a name for himself during the opening of the Mirror Flower Water Moon event on Luoposhan!

It was better to share joy than to be alone in happiness, and he would pull in Wei Bo, offer service to Zhou Fei, and even the students of the Hidden Official, like Cui Dongshan!

As long as it didn’t involve the grievances between Luoposhan and the Song family of Da Li, Wei Bo had always been straightforward, sharing his opinions without reservation. He wasn’t afraid of Qingfeng City or the jade-level practitioners like Xu Huan; it was just that engaging in a battle of wills with Qingfeng City held no meaning. Otherwise, what was wrong with celebrating the Fox Kingdom’s arrival and settling them as a vassal of Luoposhan on Huimei Mountain or Huanghu Mountain?

Was he really afraid that Xu Huan would come knocking? What would it mean if that Grand City Lord, who had just entered the fifth realm a few days ago, returned home with a bruised face?

Now that the situation was so chaotic, how things were schemed behind the scenes was one matter, but openly fighting among themselves was inappropriate. Were they supposed to imitate the Jianfeng Thunder Garden of Zhengyang Mountain?

Zhu Lian rubbed his hands together and nodded in agreement, praising Wei Bo for his far-sightedness and gentlemanly elegance.

Mi Yu felt a twinge of disappointment but didn’t know what else to say; he could only continue drinking.

Hearing about a sword immortal from Zhengyang Mountain who had closed themselves off for a hundred years only to achieve the jade-level realm had already shocked him; now there was another Grand City Lord with extraordinary power in the fifth realm?

Instinctively, Mi Yu pulled out a handful of sunflower seeds, only to notice Zhu Lian and Wei Bo looking at him. He was about to retract his hand when Zhu Lian jokingly scolded him, and Wei Bo echoed him. Only then did Mi Yu divide the seeds among the other three, including Wei Wenlong, who was no exception. Although Wei Wenlong hadn’t originally had this habit, he couldn’t resist it after seeing Xiao Mi Li go with Nuan Shu to clean the courtyard. Xiao Mi Li wouldn’t step over the threshold but would only ask from outside if the shopkeeper was working hard and if he was eating sunflower seeds. After a few times, Wei Wenlong had felt a pang of guilt and, before he knew it, had developed a craving for them. Now, late at night, sunflower seeds and wine had their own special flavor.

After hearing all the details about the Fox Kingdom, with various fox spirits of different realms and several celestial caves of various ranks, Wei Wenlong stopped his calculations and suddenly said, “According to the Hidden Official’s style, he will likely consult Pei Xiang first regarding this matter. If there’s a disagreement, both sides will clarify the reasoning and interests before making a decision.”

Zhu Lian and Wei Bo exchanged smiles.

They had both been waiting for this very statement.

Wei Wenlong didn’t disappoint.

If a financial deity only focused on money, thinking wealth was the supreme goal, he might fit in well elsewhere, but it wasn’t enough for Luoposhan.

Zhu Lian smiled and asked, “Wei Caishen, what do you think we should do regarding the fox skin talismans, which are the most profitable item from the Fox Kingdom?”

Wei Wenlong hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “Feel free to speak your mind. Whether it’s good or bad, wise or foolish, it doesn’t matter. What truly matters is that if people keep their thoughts hidden, day by day, they might find themselves at a crossroads.”

Wei Wenlong began to sweat.

Mi Yu was a bit puzzled.

Taking a deep breath, Wei Wenlong said, “The Xu family of Qingfeng City is wealthy but lacks compassion, which is certainly undesirable. However, if we at Luoposhan swing to the opposite extreme, would that really be the best choice? From my perspective, we can reduce the sources of materials for the fox skin talismans, but we shouldn’t cut them off entirely just to gain a reputation for righteousness with the Fox Kingdom’s ruler, Pei Xiang, and all the fox spirits in the kingdom. If we do that, people’s hearts will… grow bolder! They will come to favor using righteousness to pressure Luoposhan! Pei Xiang, as a Nascent Soul, ultimately represents the Fox Kingdom’s stance. Sooner or later, when public opinion swells, Pei Xiang could easily shift from one extreme of gratitude to another extreme of ingratitude! The resentment could be as great as that of Qingfeng City!”

After saying this, Wei Wenlong appeared somewhat fatigued and softly added, “As Zhu Lian said, these are my true thoughts. If you all see me as someone who only cares about money…”

Zhu Lian nodded.

At Luoposhan, they weren’t afraid of people speaking the truth, nor were they afraid of someone being self-interested. Moreover, Wei Wenlong’s words were neither selfish nor misguided; on the contrary, they were quite astute.

If a financial deity who managed the flow of wealth didn’t understand people’s hearts, then Zhu Lian would have to worry that one day, Wei Wenlong might go astray. At that point, he might forget how remarkable he had been, his high position on the continent, and that the fundamental reason for his success was where he stood and what ground he walked on. While his own talent played a part, it certainly wasn’t the only reason. To put it frankly, if Zhu Lian managed the finances, he might not shine as brightly as Wei Wenlong, but the difference wouldn’t be that great.

However, Luoposhan welcomed all kinds of flowers to bloom, and Zhu Lian genuinely hoped for that. Whether it was the martial arts path or the sword path, they would provide shelter for those still growing, allowing them to grow without worry. When spring came, flowers would bloom just like it always did.

Wei Bo felt even more gratified.

Mi Yu rarely took the initiative to speak, “Is the Hidden Official not focused on money every day? What’s wrong with that? Wenlong, it seems you need to cultivate your heart more.”

Wei Wenlong looked up, half-believing.

Mi Yu rolled his eyes, imitating the Hidden Official, who occasionally spoke at the Summer Resort: “Are you saying you’re not?”

Mi Yu, unusually serious, continued, “My initial intention is to do good for others while earning money; there’s no conflict there. The fox spirits of the Fox Kingdom, due to the atmosphere deliberately created by Qingfeng City, have long been at odds with each other, leading to constant disputes and killings. Every year, old fox pelts shed, so what? Are you, Wenlong, planning to become some kind of moral saint? If not, why should we feel guilty and act all timid?”

Wei Wenlong, being from Chunfan Studio, was half a member of the Summer Resort, and Mi Yu felt compelled to defend him, regardless of the validity of his arguments.

If Zhu Lian, the old chef they had just met, held a grudge against him, Mi Yu would accept it.

Zhu Lian raised his cup of wine, “Wenlong, you underestimate our Mountain Lord’s discernment of people. Drink with me, then pour yourself another cup.”

This was a double entendre; Wei Wenlong underestimated himself and also Luoposhan.

Wei Bo was just about to raise his sleeve.

Wei Wenlong quickly said, “Mountain Lord Wei, I still have plenty of wine left in my flask.”

Zhu Lian laughed and scolded, “You, Wei Wenlong, acting like a financial deity of Luoposhan! Are you trying to save wine for the Grand Mountain Lord of Beiyue or look down on the Night Feast of Beiyue?!”

Wei Bo smiled, “Could we please just move on from this matter?”

Mi Yu, munching on sunflower seeds, quietly added, “We might agree, but the many celestial beings and mountain spirits in the Beiyue territory eager for the next Night Feast might not be so accommodating.”

Wei Bo raised both hands, gently rubbing his temples.

Zhu Lian lifted his cup again and stood up, laughing, “There will come a day when Luoposhan truly shines in the eyes of the world. Until then, let us work hard, each showcasing our talents. I believe in the near future, when the young ones at home grow up, Luoposhan will definitely not…”

At this point, Zhu Lian looked at Mi Yu.

Mi Yu stood up and smiled, “We will definitely not let the Hidden Official down!”

Wei Wenlong followed suit, raising his cup, “Luoposhan will certainly have a steady stream of wealth!”

Lastly, Wei Bo stood up, saying helplessly, “Let’s strive to avoid organizing any more dubious Night Feasts.”

They all drank up their cups.

Then they took their seats once more, except for Wei Bo, who continued to look toward Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian asked, “Have we finished chatting? Brother Wei, feel free to attend to your duties. As a great mountain lord, I’m sure you have much to do, so I won’t make you stay against your will.”

Mi Yu still didn’t grasp the deeper meaning.

Wei Wenlong, with sharp eyes, had noticed Zhu Lian had already tucked the imitation Twelve Flower Goddess Cup into his sleeve.

So, Wei Wenlong extended his hand to grasp the wine cup, representing Luoposhan’s stance.

Learning from the Hidden Official’s way of doing things was difficult, but learning to be shameless like the Hidden Official was far easier.

Mi Yu, slow to realize, smiled and covered the wine cup, saying, “Each of us has two jars of wine; tonight has been enjoyable enough. We can save more for next time.”

Wei Bo sighed, placing his wine cup down on the table, and his figure dissipated, returning to Piyun Mountain.

The remaining three laughed heartily.

(End of Chapter)

 Chapter 842: A Startling Encounter for Hao Ran (Part 2)

On the right side, Sui had just returned from the New Year's shop in Qilong Alley, where she had a chat with the shopkeeper, Shi Rou, about the situation regarding Shujian Lake and the True Realm Sect. As for her own cultivation, she merely mentioned that she was at a bottleneck in the Golden Core stage.

Meanwhile, Rong Chang, a sword cultivator from Floating Duckweed Sword Lake, and her senior disciple, Li Cai, had brought along her junior sister, Sui Jingcheng, to visit the Ruined Mountain. The two had visited before, so they were familiar with the path. Coming from the north were Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang, who returned to Ruined Mountain around the same time as Rong Chang and Sui Jingcheng.

Cui Wei, who had recently ascended to the Nascent Soul stage, made his way to the Old Dragon City battlefield after stopping by the Ascension Platform. He also sought the help of Wei Shanjun beforehand, leveraging his position as a disciple of the Cloudy Peak’s Crown Prince.

Cui Wei was a native sword cultivator of the Sword Qi Great Wall, so it was no surprise that he was able to become a spy placed there by the Grand Li National Master. His character, talent, and intellect were all exceptional.

Hong Xia successfully entered the Nascent Soul stage as well. After recovering from her injuries in the water cave of Yu Ye River, she took the same path back and had to comply with the insistence of the estate manager, Zhu Lian, who instructed her to personally thank each of the river deities and mountain spirits along the way.

Hong Xia didn't find this too bothersome, since as a Nascent Soul Water Dragon, she might be revered as a Bodhisattva in other celestial realms. However, at Ruined Mountain, she felt the need to be cautious; she couldn’t help but wonder if Ruined Mountain intended to send her to confront some formidable enemy atop a mountain, like the Water Flooding Qingfeng City or crashing into the ancestral mountain of Zhengyang?

Nevertheless, Hong Xia found herself startled in a more manageable way. It was her first time proactively visiting Ruined Mountain, and as she climbed the mountain path, she encountered Pei Xiang.

Both of them were at comparable levels of cultivation. As the ruler of the Fox Nation, Pei Xiang possessed more magical techniques and offensive treasures than Hong Xia. However, when it came to combat power, even one and a half Pei Xiangs would likely struggle against Hong Xia — especially in close combat, where Pei Xiang would undoubtedly lose. Thus, when Pei Xiang truly met Hong Xia, she was more shocked than Hong Xia was to see her.

At that moment, Pei Xiang was strolling on the steps when she spotted Hong Xia and the little water monster climbing the mountain together. The girl in black was still strutting about, claiming to have learned from Pei Qian and slightly embellishing her style, swaggering with an air of arrogance: “Walking with bravado, demons feel uneasy.”

This wasn’t particularly strange; Pei Xiang had seen her share of oddities. What truly astounded her was that the nearly water-soaked Nascent Soul Water Dragon was intentionally walking a step behind the little girl, almost as if it was a deliberate act. The girl was short, while Hong Xia was tall, so their interactions didn’t seem overly bizarre.

Unaware of the strangeness, the little girl focused on guiding her sister Hong Xia, who was a guest for the first time. She occasionally shared tidbits about the trees — when the mountain lord and Pei Qian planted them, or who gifted the flowers and plants to the warm tree sister, with a bit of complaint that the warm tree sister often stopped her from asking Wei Shanjun for bamboo. “Hey, I’m not stingy with sunflower seeds; I can’t be the only one with no trees planted on the mountain, right? Right, Sister Hong Xia? You should help me persuade warm tree sister; then I can let Pei Qian remember your great contribution…”

Pei Xiang could sense Hong Xia’s restraint, a kind of reverence for entering a different small world.

Zhu Lian stood at a fork in the mountain path with his hands clasped behind his back, smiling to welcome his guests.

Hong Xia offered a respectful greeting.

Pei Xiang approached Zhu Lian as well.

Zhu Lian nodded at the water dragon. “Miss Hong Xia, you should become more familiar with Pei Xiang; you must have guessed by now that she is the ruler of the Fox Nation. Let’s have a casual chat first.”

At Zhu Lian's door, Xiao Mi Li stood guard at the entrance without needing the old chef to prompt her.

Zhu Lian laughed, “Xiao Mi Li, join us in the conversation.”

Zhou Mi Li frowned, refusing to budge, and shook her head. “You all talk; I don’t understand anything, so I’ll just stand here.”

Zhu Lian called out in a serious tone, “Right Protector of Ruined Mountain.”

Zhou Mi Li perked up immediately, “Got it, got it!”

Once inside the courtyard, Zhou Mi Li sat properly, her arms crossed, forcing herself to maintain a serious expression without fidgeting.

Pei Xiang initially thought Zhu Lian was merely going to chat about trivial matters, but the topics he brought up grew increasingly significant. He first discussed a few potential locations for the Fox Nation’s settlement on Ruined Mountain, as well as the current state of the Lotus Root Blessed Land, indicating that she would get to choose the site.

Then Zhu Lian encouraged Pei Xiang to consider carefully before discussing the construction of the water palace on Huanghu Mountain, detailing how much celestial money Ruined Mountain could provide to assist her in establishing her residence.

Throughout the conversation, although Xiao Mi Li remained silent, her expression was serious as she listened intently, no longer pretending to understand when she didn’t.

After their discussion, Zhu Lian smiled and asked, “Right Protector, do you have any thoughts to share?”

Zhou Mi Li, who had been perfectly still, scratched her face, “Can I not have any?”

Zhu Lian responded with a smile, “You can.”

Zhou Mi Li chuckled, “Then I have none.”

At this moment, her mind was still buzzing.

Suddenly, the little girl appeared somewhat troubled and softly asked, “Such an important matter, Old Chef, aren’t you going to call warm tree sister? Wouldn’t she be sad if she found out?”

Zhu Lian smiled and explained, “Warm Tree has greater responsibilities; she doesn’t need to concern herself with these matters. So, anything discussed here today, you can certainly share with warm tree. Just remember not to hide anything on purpose.”

Zhou Mi Li picked up the golden shoulder pole and travel staff from the table. “Then I’ll go patrol the mountains! Yu Mi is still waiting for me.”

Zhu Lian waved his hand and continued discussing the details of the site selection and establishment with Pei Xiang and Hong Xia.

Pei Xiang chose to settle the Fox Nation in the Lotus Root Blessed Land, while Hong Xia was reluctant for Ruined Mountain to spend money, claiming she had some savings of her own. However, she did need Ruined Mountain to connect her with the mountain craftsmen for constructing her residence.

Then Zhu Lian cheerfully remarked, “You don’t want Ruined Mountain to spend a single cent. Miss Hong Xia, are you intending to establish your own mountain stronghold? Planning to carve out your own territory and rule over the waters and mountains, listening to orders but not proclamations?”

The moment these words left his mouth, Hong Xia’s face turned pale with fright.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “No need to be nervous; it was just a joke. You’re much better than that troublesome Yun Zi, who needs more polishing.”

Hong Xia didn’t dare to utter a word.

Zhu Lian waved his hand, “Ruined Mountain will not skimp on necessary expenses. Hong Xia, since you come here infrequently, you might not be familiar with many rules, so just remember this: favors within the rules are indeed favors. If you don’t understand the rules and start making reckless claims about favors, will you then resent Ruined Mountain for not returning the favor in your heart? That wouldn’t be reasonable, would it?”

Hong Xia stood up, offered a deep bow, and affirmed, “Hong Xia has received your teachings and will obey.”

After Hong Xia left, Pei Xiang sighed, “Yan Fang, are you trying to intimidate me?”

In Qingfeng City, Pei Xiang liked to secretly refer to him as Zhu Lian, but upon arriving at Ruined Mountain, she began to enjoy calling him Yan Fang.

Zhu Lian shook his head, “Don’t overthink it. At Ruined Mountain, we treat others with sincerity, only discussing reason.”

After pondering for a moment, Zhu Lian added, “I’ll have a Jade Purity stage sword immortal accompany you to the Lotus Root Blessed Land first. After you see the blessed land with your own eyes, we’ll finalize the site selection.”

Pei Xiang couldn’t help but smile bitterly; she had guessed half of it. She had speculated that “Yu Mi” was a Nascent Soul sword immortal but hadn’t expected it to be a fully-fledged great sword immortal…

Luckily, Mi Yu wasn’t here; otherwise, she would probably feel scolded again.

Once Cao Qinglang returned to Ruined Mountain, he took over as the new gatekeeper in place of Xiao Mi Li without hesitation.

Upon learning that Pei Qian had not only failed to return to Ruined Mountain but had also gone from North Ju Lu Continent to the Aiai Continent, Cao Qinglang was momentarily at a loss for what to do.

Today, Cao Qinglang had stepped out to Ruined Mountain to rent a vassal mountain for Zhu Chai Island.

He was there to discuss the matter of the ink dragon boat with Liu Chongrun, not under Zhu Lian’s personal authority, nor was it the mountain lord Wei Bo, but rather Cao Qinglang.

This was where the knowledge came into play.

When Zhu Lian spoke about business, it was an official matter between Ruined Mountain and Zhu Chai Island. Although the dragon boat belonged to Ruined Mountain, it wasn’t related to the island lord or the long princess who once listened to the government behind a curtain, 

However, when it came to discussing matters with a woman, one must first establish a good rapport. 

Thus, Cao Qinglang was the most suitable choice.

Cao Qinglang was currently the only direct descendant of the mountain lord Chen Ping’an at Ruined Mountain, serving as both a mentor and a student, passing down the literary tradition.

Liu Chongrun naturally understood this fact very well; Chen Ping’an treated his students, Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian, as if they were his own children. 

In Liu Chongrun’s presence, Cao Qinglang naturally held a junior position, making Liu Chongrun less likely to be angry, or perhaps even not angry at all. 

It was akin to having half the mountain lord Chen Ping’an negotiating the matter. Even if there had only been half a reason previously, it would likely become a complete one in the heart of the woman.

After finishing the patrol with Zhou Mi Li, Mi Yu expressed interest in the misty Lotus Root Blessed Land upon hearing Zhu Lian mention the journey and happily agreed to accompany Pei Xiang.

Zhu Lian had already explained the precautions for visiting the blessed land under the guise of a fallen immortal, but this time, he planned to invite the long-lived friend to join as well.

At this moment, sitting on the steps, watching the distant figure of Cao Qinglang leave, Mi Yu gave Zhu Lian a thumbs up, “Brother Zhu knows the hearts of beauties best!”

Zhu Lian complained, “Why is Mi Yu cursing people? How can a martial arts master praise a fledgling like this? Isn't it harmful?”

Mi Yu laughed heartily, “There’s no distinction between seniors and juniors; we are merely fellow practitioners, sparring and forging ahead together!”

Since Mi Yu said so, Zhu Lian didn’t want to be overly formal either, laughing heartily, “My path is not lonely!”

Today, Wei Wendong, who rarely stepped out of his office, had no idea what they were discussing.

Wei Wendong was only worried whether Cao Qinglang would face a closed door when visiting Liu Chongrun.

Xiao Mi Li squatted behind the old chef and Mi Yu, frowning deeply as she listened, not understanding much. She decided to note it down first and ask warm tree sister and Pei Qian later.

Zhu Lian fell silent for a moment, his expression solemn. Suddenly, he said, “Delicate and graceful, pausing in elegance. The mountains and rivers here suddenly gather, revealing a gentle embrace.”

Mi Yu, still quick-witted, recited in a flowing manner, “Tender and soft, swaying gently. Viewed horizontally as peaks, viewed sideways as ridges, it’s indeed hard to control.”

The two lines matched nicely.

Zhu Lian turned his head, and Mi Yu did the same, clapping their hands in unison. Everything was understood without words.

Behind them, Xiao Mi Li sighed; luckily, the good-natured mountain lord wasn’t here; otherwise, she would feel ashamed again.

Wei Wendong truly had no ears for this; he got up and left.

Xiao Mi Li cleared her throat, “What are you two talking about? I can recite poetry too! I have the word ‘pause’ in my poem; do you want to hear it?”

She borrowed a poem from Liu Ke Shui, promising to return it after showing off, although she initially intended to keep it for Pei Qian. However, now she felt the urge to compete with the old chef and Mi Yu, planning to showcase it to embarrass them.

Zhu Lian was momentarily astonished, having completely forgotten about Xiao Mi Li’s keen ears. So he immediately decided to take the risk, turning to Xiao Mi Li with a smile, “I don’t know how to recite poetry; these two lines are written by Brother Mi Yu. I suddenly remembered them and recited them. Xiao Mi Li, remember? It was Mi Yu who got inspired while snacking on sunflower seeds; it has nothing to do with me.”

Mi Yu was a bit confused.

Zhu Lian had already quickly left, not looking back.

Xiao Mi Li gave Mi Yu a thumbs up, praising, “Wonderful talent! We can have poetry duels in the future!”

Mi Yu probably still didn’t fully understand that the Right Protector of Ruined Mountain would never hide anything from Warm Tree Sister and Pei Qian, while Pei Qian’s ledger was calculated based on “principles.” Moreover, Xiao Mi Li often forgot things, and while she could recall seemingly trivial matters, she could forget significant events, such as being bullied, while remembering the smallest details, like how a white cloud looked a bit plump today, or how much louder the thunder was last night, compared to the last time…

In the past, while at home on the mountain, Pei Qian had never shown any impatience, likely a reason why Xiao Mi Li remained so important.

Ruined Mountain sent a flying sword to relay messages to the New Year's shop in Qilong Alley.

Soon, the long-lived friend quietly arrived at Ruined Mountain.

After the three of them — the long-lived friend, Mi Yu, and Pei Xiang — entered the Lotus Root Blessed Land, Zhu Lian stood alone at the cliff’s edge, feeling slightly fatigued. It wasn’t that the work was hard, but the mountain lord had been absent for too long, causing a lingering sense of burden.

Zhu Lian had taken on a student, Cen Yuanji, temporarily as a named disciple, but he was not yet a direct successor. Cen Yuanji had reached the fourth stage of martial arts, and outside of Ruined Mountain, he could indeed be considered a martial arts genius.

As for the sword cultivator Sui Youbian from the True Realm Sect, she had yet to accept a direct disciple, nor did she even have a named disciple.

Lu Baixiang had been recruited by a Crown Prince’s mountain in the Central Peak to serve as a steward, effectively giving all factions a strong backing. In the Ministry of Rites of Grand Li, he now held a semi-official position. His only direct disciples were the siblings Yuan Bao and Yuan Lai, who were said to have encountered a celestial opportunity at that Crown Prince’s mountain, but Lu Baixiang had not elaborated on this matter in his correspondence.

As for Wei Xian, the founding emperor of the Nanyuan Kingdom, he had started as a military monk alongside Liu Xunmei and Cao Jun, gradually establishing himself as a legitimate military officer of Grand Li through a series of real battlefield experiences. The “clean stream” status of Grand Li’s civil and military officials is quite rare, and Wei Xian even obtained a low-ranking peacekeeping certificate issued by the Grand Li Ministry of Justice. This was facilitated by Liu Xunmei, who was one of the officials overseeing construction. Wei Xian’s military achievements were sufficient, but the Ministry of Justice still held the power to grant or deny such certificates. With Liu Xunmei’s intervention, he was able to navigate this delicate balance, ensuring no violation of Grand Li’s laws while also doing Liu Xunmei a favor.

Cao Qinglang returned from Ao Yu Peak with good news: Liu Chongrun greatly praised Ruined Mountain’s actions. She was even willing to offer her water palace, allowing Ruined Mountain to help coordinate the dragon boat for the Grand Li border troops. However, Cao Qinglang had already prepared responses for both the best and worst outcomes and, following Zhu Lian’s advice, politely declined Liu Chongrun’s goodwill while persuading her not to take such actions.

After returning to the mountain, Cao Qinglang naturally took on the role of gatekeeper. After discussing matters with Zhu Lian, he returned to the foot of the mountain.

Zhong Fuzi also practiced his boxing along the mountain path today, deliberately waiting for Cen Yuanji twice, once at the mountain top and once at the foot, to point out the subtle flaws in his boxing technique.

Cen Yuanji respected this scholarly and easy-going elder from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, second only to Zhu Lian, who he considered a half-master.

After returning home, Zhong Fuzi lit a lamp and studied the teachings of sages late into the night. This journey had taken him from Treasure Bottle Continent to the Sword Qi Great Wall, then from the Upside-Down Mountain to South Posa Continent, Middle Land Divine Continent, Aiai Continent, North Ju Lu Continent, and back to Treasure Bottle Continent. He had traversed half of the Hao Ran world, gaining rich insights — not only delving into the doctrines of various scholars and schools but also encountering numerous immortals and heroes. Some resonated with his temperament and knowledge, while others engaged him in discussions of principles or martial arts. Naturally, there were also perilous encounters where punches determined life and death.
Zhong Qiu had never been a stuffy scholar. As the national teacher of the Southern Garden Nation, he was anything but a rigid bookworm.

Today, Cen Yuanji paused once more at the foot of the mountain, hesitating for a moment before finally approaching the young Confucian scholar reading by the moonlight.

Cen Yuanji was known for her diligent practice of martial arts on the Ruined Peak (Luopok Shan). She knew that Cao Qinglang was not only a disciple of Confucianism but also a practitioner of the Dao. It was said that Cao Qinglang had traveled far and wide under the guidance of Master Zhong, which was why he had taken so many years to return to Ruined Peak.

A hint of envy flickered across Cen Yuanji's heart. Her home was not far from Ruined Peak, located in the city of Longzhou, yet she had never truly ventured far beyond its borders.

Whenever someone came to the door—be it Zheng Dafeng, Yuan Lai, Xiao Mili, or even Cao Qinglang—they would sit on a bench or a bamboo chair, casually placing two or three snacks nearby for when the need arose. Of course, there were also sunflower seeds.

Cen Yuanji sat on a bamboo chair, silent for a long while. "Cao Qinglang, I’m currently stuck at the fourth realm of martial arts. Yuan Bao wrote to me earlier; she has already reached the fifth realm. You’ve traveled to many places—are there many martial artists at the fourth or fifth realm at our age?"

Cao Qinglang replied honestly, "Not many, especially among women. However, during this journey with my master, I have indeed encountered quite a few martial geniuses. Many of them have already achieved great success at a young age."

He quickly added with a smile, "But my master firmly believes that on the path of martial arts, there are distinctions in levels, and one should not fear the situation of ‘learning martial arts but achieving a lower level’."

Cen Yuanji was puzzled. "Why shouldn’t we be afraid? If I were in your position, I would be anxious to death."

Cao Qinglang replied, "To be honest, I don’t quite understand it either. However, my master said it with such seriousness, only explaining that ‘if you fear yourself, you will die in your practice.’ I’m not purely a martial artist, so I didn’t ask further. I just felt that this principle of martial arts, when placed in a book, fits well, which is why I remember it clearly."

Suddenly, Cen Yuanji laughed, her beautiful eyes narrowing into crescent moons. She tried to stifle her laughter but couldn’t help it, covering her mouth with her hand, smiling softly as if recalling something after hearing Cao Qinglang’s words, which lightened her mood considerably. Unfortunately, this matter was not something she could share with him; it was something she could discuss only with the bookworm Yuan Lai, not with Cao Qinglang.

Cao Qinglang was somewhat bewildered by her reaction, but seeing that Cen Yuanji no longer seemed so downcast, he smiled slightly and returned to his reading.

Before leaving, Cen Yuanji asked, "Cao Qinglang, may I ask, what realm is your master in martial arts?"

Cao Qinglang smiled and shook his head, "Of course you can ask, but as a student of my master, I cannot disclose such matters."

Cen Yuanji looked into the clear eyes of the young scholar and did not take offense. Instead, she nodded with a smile and clasped her hands in farewell.

Cao Qinglang couldn’t help but think of his hometown—the shabby alley where his ancestral home was located, the school, the bustling Scholar Alley, the entire capital of the Southern Garden Nation, and the foreign guest, Mr. Lu, a figure akin to the "Lotus Flower's Blessed Land" like his master.

His master, Zhong Qiu, of course, was a great benefactor to Cao Qinglang. 

In truth, Mr. Lu weighed heavily on Cao Qinglang’s mind too. After traveling to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he learned from his master that this Mr. Lu was actually a prominent figure among the Yin-Yang school, a descendant of the esteemed Lu clan.

Their first meeting had taken place on the ferry to Osmanthus Island, where they became acquainted at Upside-Down Mountain. Mr. Lu had helped his master "give a grain of rain money" in an act of great friendship.

In a fortunate turn of events, they had both boarded another intercontinental ferry, the Swallowing Whale, journeying to Pine Leaf Island together. Not only had they fought side by side, but they had also shared life and death, becoming close friends who no longer needed to discuss money.

Zhang Shanfeng, Xu Yuanxia, Lu Tai, Zhong Kui, and Liu Jinglong—these individuals were all regarded by his master as close companions and equals, with the roguish Xu Yuanxia considered something of a senior.

As for his fellow townsman Liu Xianyang, he was somewhat different; his master never denied that he regarded Liu Xianyang as an elder brother and treated the snot-nosed kid from Mud Bottle Alley as a younger brother. They were all family to him.

Lu Tai was actually one of the people who cared for him the most after leaving the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land, along with Master Zhong.

Without their guidance, life would have continued to be a daily grind, but it would have been much more difficult. 

Yet the elegant and unparalleled Mr. Lu had gone to the Clear Void World along with one of the Lotus Flower's Blessed Lands.

Cao Qinglang wondered if he would ever have the chance to reunite with Mr. Lu in this lifetime.

His master had once casually chatted with him in the pavilion at Dragon Slayer Cliff, jokingly saying that looking back, Lu Tai had brought with him a whole array of treasures and endless methods of the immortals, showcasing the demeanor of a direct descendant of the Lu clan—though his realm was a bit too low. Many young prodigies from the Central Lands with backgrounds in immortal clans could raise their realms as easily as drinking water. For example, Cao Qinglang had met a talented cultivator named Huai Qian in Beiju Luzhou. 

When he eventually encountered Lu Tai, he had to have a good laugh about how, because of a fear of heights, he had also come to fear the "elevation" of his cultivation realm.

His master rarely spoke ill of others behind their backs, but whenever he mentioned them to his students or disciples, he often spoke of friends. The stories he told were always ones that made him smile, ones that brought him joy rather than sorrow.

In the end, Cao Qinglang sincerely expressed that if he hadn’t known Mr. Lu was a heroic figure, he would have mistakenly thought Mr. Lu was a woman masquerading as a traveler in the martial world.

For some reason, his master had shown an odd expression at that moment. He even reached out, gently pressing down on Cao Qinglang's head, giving him a rare admonition, telling him not to dwell on such thoughts at such a young age. Once he returned to Ruined Peak, he should avoid mixing with Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng. If he ever caught wind of Cao Qinglang sneaking a peek at those immortal books, he would go to Cloud Peak and chop bamboo to make him a ruler...

Tonight was an exception; Cao Qinglang could hardly focus on his reading. He simply closed the book and began to rest his eyes.

For some reason, he had a strong feeling that his master was about to return home.

Mi Yu had already returned from the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land with the other three, and they had done so smoothly. Pei Xiang had chosen a feng shui treasure location along the border of the Songlai Nation, a secluded area of mountains and waters, which also occupied a potential dragon vein. In her excitement, Pei Xiang promised that the Fox Nation would provide an additional eight hundred grains of rain money as the first "settling-in fee." However, these grains of rain money were to be managed by Ruined Peak's accounting, needing to be invested in the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land, especially since her chosen location had to account for at least fifty percent of the spiritual energy transformed from the immortal money.

Pei Xiang had already roughly understood the customs and trade dynamics of Ruined Peak. She realized that one must not be too pretentious or overly reserved; one had to "treat others with sincerity," speaking directly without losing face.

So upon returning to Ruined Peak, Wei Wenlong carefully calculated the accounts with Pei Xiang.

The back-and-forth negotiations were nothing new to Pei Xiang; instead, she felt reassured. In the end, both sides were pleased. The Fox Nation’s investment was upgraded to one thousand grains of rain money, but the spiritual energy from the chosen site could only account for thirty percent; otherwise, it would greatly disrupt the changes in the fortunes of the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land. When it came to this matter, Wei Wenlong, who had been diligently discussing trade, hardly ever showed a serious expression. He sternly warned that if there were any financial disputes that led to turmoil in the blessed land, causing fluctuations in the fortunes of the four nations, the mountain lord would not spare anyone. You, Pei Xiang, I, Wei Wenlong, and even Zhu Lian would all be held accountable—no one could escape!

Pei Xiang had already obtained the results she wanted, so she naturally had no objections. In fact, she was even prepared to spend one thousand grains of rain money for only twenty percent of the spiritual energy.

The reason she was willing to spend this extra thousand grains of rain money was not only for the dual meanings of "faithfulness" and "visiting gift," but Pei Xiang was not foolish; she could see that elevating a Lotus Flower's Blessed Land from a medium to a high-ranking blessed land was an easy and inevitable trend. The Fox Nation would benefit tremendously from settling here, able to reap blessings for hundreds of years.

Chang Ming, a friend of theirs, secretly visited the chief steward, Zhu Lian.

After some polite exchanges, when they discussed the true value of the Fox Nation, both of them fell silent for a moment before speaking in unison, "Literary prosperity."

On this day, Zhong Qiu invited Zhu Lian for a drink, and the old chef prepared several dishes to accompany the wine.

Their conversation was straightforward; they had no need for pretense, as they were both from the same hometown and fellow cultivators.

Before leaving, Master Zhong stood and bowed in gratitude to Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian accepted the gesture with ease.

After all, the Fox Nation was something he had brought to Ruined Peak through his own efforts. If the literary prosperity of the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land could increase by four to five percent or even seven to eight percent in the future, who would be most pleased? Of course, it would be Zhong Qiu, the national teacher, who had the well-being of the world’s people at heart.

As Zhu Lian accompanied him out, he simply said, "We can’t let Master Zhong regret coming to Ruined Peak."

Zhong Qiu shook his head. "Even in death, I have no regrets; I have no regrets at all!"

Zhu Lian gave a hearty slap on Zhong Qiu’s back, laughing as he scolded, "What a gloomy thing to say?!"

With a hearty laugh, Zhong Qiu departed, feeling quite pleased in his heart.

Zhu Lian thought that this Zhong Qiu could truly be regarded as a sage in this vast world.

Every time Mi Yu took a break, he enjoyed sitting quietly at the top of the steps, spending a moment alone to clear his mind, which helped alleviate his worries.

As for sitting on the cliffside stone table with Xiao Mili, munching on sunflower seeds, that was purely for fun. Or when he encountered the seemingly always busy Xiao Nuan Tree, Mi Yu would also feel delighted.

The Hidden Official had once earnestly declared at the summer palace that he and Mi Yu shared a natural affinity, and that he would visit Ruined Peak more often when given the chance.

The young Hidden Official had then squinted and smiled, rubbing his thumb and forefinger together, signaling to the leader of the summer palace, that every time the great swordsman Mi Yu came to visit Ruined Peak, he must not forget to show sincerity.

At this moment, Mi Yu chuckled, "Oh, Hidden Official, the reason you were unwilling for me to become a guest at Ruined Peak back then was not because of the repeated formalities?"

Zhu Lian slowly walked over and sat beside Mi Yu, offering him a jug of glutinous rice wine from the Dong family shop, which Ruined Peak received quite a bit of every year.

Mi Yu opened the wine jug, taking a sip. The taste was soft and mellow, with a lingering aftertaste. He smiled and said, "No wonder Ruined Peak has such a reputation."

From Wei Wenlong’s ease to his own adaptation to local customs, to tonight's firsthand experience of Cao Qinglang and Cen Yuanji’s casual conversation, he felt a sense of familiarity.

Zhu Lian finished a large gulp of wine, wiping his mouth as he nodded and said, "One mountain lord, one style of conduct."

Even if they did not speak of Ruined Peak, one could mention the young swordsman from Beiju Luzhou, Qi Jinglong, who was a dear friend of Mi Yu’s son. 

Although it was rumored that he had been halted by the lawmaster Huang Tong, who did not permit him to go to the battlefield in Longcheng on Baoping Island, with the reasoning that "the sect leader of Taihui Sword Sect cannot die; it’s just a temporary measure," while the swordsman Huang Tong himself rushed to another battlefield. Qi Jinglong did not remain in the ancestral hall or on the graceful peak to cultivate but led his own earth immortal sword cultivators to leave the sect, first uniting with several major sects that had friendly relations with Taihui Sword Sect, then teaming up with many like-minded cultivators to quell disturbances on the mountains and plains, striking down anyone who went too far. He would not allow any signs of internal strife in Beiju Luzhou, preventing those rogue and hidden demon clan cultivators from stirring trouble and causing disaster.

People of a certain caliber naturally associate with friends of similar standing. This was true for their mountain lord Chen Ping’an, as well as Liu Jinglong.

Mi Yu, regaining a bit of his carefree charm, quietly said, "What about that Sui Jingcheng, the young lady?"

When Sui Jingcheng visited Nuan Tree and Mili, she treated them as if they were her own daughters. Not only did she find various ways to send gifts, each one carefully selected, but she also willingly devoted a great deal of time to the two young girls without a hint of awkwardness. Sui Jingcheng’s presence had brought an abundance of laughter to Nuan Tree and Mili in recent days. Even Mili had privately sought help from Yu Mi and the old chef to find several reasons for her senior brother Rong Chang not to descend the mountain for a few days.

For a young lady of her stature to act like this—what other reason could there be?

Zhu Lian chuckled, "Why be so explicit?"

After finishing the wine, Zhu Lian slowly remarked, "A true man speaks of principles, not profits. A real hero speaks of order, not success or failure. A sage speaks of the world, not just one lifetime!"

Mi Yu nodded, then shook his head.

Not all Hidden Officials were like that.

Zhu Lian laughed, "Of course, my son is one of a kind."

Then one day, the swordsman Zuo arrived at Ruined Peak.

Mi Yu had grown accustomed to being lazy at Ruined Peak, feeling somewhat guilty only when discussing serious matters.

However, upon seeing Zuo, the swordsman and the Hidden Official's senior disciple, Mi Yu felt so guilty that he wished he could dig a hole and hide. He simply went outside the mountain and found his good friend Liu Xianyang to drink instead.

In the end, this led to the scene outside the Grand Hall at Jiscolor Peak.

The disciples of the Confucian Sage first paid their respects to their master with incense, then sat on the chairs outside the door.

Aside from Chen Nuan Tree, who opened the door, and Zhou Mili, who helped move the chairs, only Zhu Lian remained to observe from a distance.

Cao Qinglang had just accompanied Zhong Qiu to the state city and was on his way back.

After Zuo stood up, Zhou Mili dashed over to help Zuo carry the chair back into the Grand Hall, insisting that he let her do it.

Zuo had no choice but to give up.

If Mi Yu or Pei Xiang had been present, they would have likely had their eyes pop out in disbelief.

When Zhou Mili returned, Chen Nuan Tree closed the door again.

Zuo smiled, "You must be Zhou Mili, the 'water monster of the mute lake' my junior brother mentioned?"

Zhou Mili couldn’t help but open her mouth wide, then quickly handed her golden shoulder pole and mountain staff to Nuan Tree for safekeeping, covering her mouth before finally placing her hand over it and laughing, "Good sir mountain lord's senior brother, you’re even bigger than a table! You know me?"

Zuo laughed and asked, "What do you mean by bigger than a table?"

Zhou Mili explained, "It means you can fit many big white bowls on it, the size of sunflower seeds, quite normal-sized, but big enough to be called a table! That means you’re the biggest of all!"

Zuo nodded, "I suppose you could put it that way."

Zhou Mili was so happy that she began to bounce in place, a dance she had learned from Pei Qian, who had gotten it from Sister Baoping. This was the martial arts legacy of the Jianghu.

Zuo reached out and ruffled Nuan Tree's hair gently, saying softly, "Your little junior brother often mentions you at the Sword Qi Great Wall. He’s always worried you might be bullied by someone named Chen Lingjun. If that’s the case, I, as the mountain lord's senior brother, can give him a little reminder."

Zhou Mili quickly replied, "Chen Lingjun has gone to Beiju Luzhou to roam; he hasn’t bullied Nuan Tree! Please don’t scold him, great swordsman!"

Chen Nuan Tree made a bow and said, "Mr. Zuo, Chen Lingjun is very kind and wouldn’t bully anyone."

Zuo nodded and, seeing Zhu Lian approaching with a bow, got straight to the point, "Is there any hurdle at Ruined Peak that I can help with?"

After Zhu Lian returned the gesture, he said, "There is indeed something that requires your help, Mr. Zuo."

Zuo was a bit surprised. "Oh? Which fool from Baoping Island?"

Even the usually smooth Zhu Lian was momentarily at a loss for words.

This way of chatting was a first.

Zhu Lian explained the matter of connecting the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land with the Broken Well’s Cave Heaven.

In the vast world, there were only two such grand feats. One was Zhu Lian's hometown, where the blessed land had once been connected to the Lotus Cave Heaven of the Dao Ancestor.

After hearing this, Zuo said, "A small matter."

Having finally arrived at Ruined Peak, it seemed Zuo was a bit disappointed that this was all he would be doing.

On the way to the bamboo building at Ruined Peak, Zuo walked slowly, carefully consulting Zhu Lian about the geographical situation of the Lotus Flower's Blessed Land. After gaining a rough understanding, he suggested asking the Long Life Daoist for some divine knowledge and checking in with Master Zhong about the current state of his hometown’s mountains and rivers. If Mr. Zhu did not find it troublesome, they could also inquire about Pei Xiang, the guest from the blessed land. As for how to draw his sword in the end, there was no need to ask anyone else. 

Zhu Lian agreed to everything, saying it would take a maximum of two hours.
As they arrived outside the bamboo building, Zuo You called over Cao Qinglang, who had just returned to the mountain. Sitting on the cliff's edge, he began to ask him about matters of learning.

Zuo You remarked, "When it comes to studying, you need to be more diligent than your teacher. He's too clever for his own good; his attitude towards learning is actually not as good as yours."

Cao Qinglang was at a loss, unsure whether to nod or shake his head, and even more uncertain about how to respond.

Zuo You asked, "Has Pei Qian returned from his travels yet?"

Cao Qinglang nodded, saying, "The last message we received from Laopojiao (the Abandoned Peak) was from the Leigong Temple on Aiai Continent, sent from the home of the Tenth Realm martial artist, Pei Ahxiang."

Zuo You furrowed his brow slightly. "Did Pei Qian send the letter himself?"

At such a young age, how could he be so careless while out alone? "Don’t follow in your master’s footsteps."

Cao Qinglang shook his head. "It was actually Senior Xie Songhua, the Sword Immortal from Aiai Continent, who helped him out. Pei Qian is quite cautious when navigating the martial world."

Zuo You nodded and smiled. "That’s good to hear."

However, he couldn't help but feel dissatisfied when he looked at the younger disciple. The students he had taken under his wing, on the other hand, seemed much more pleasing to the eye.

Zuo You continued, "As a Confucian disciple and someone who cultivates the Dao, you must focus on both your heart and strength. My master doesn’t like to interfere too much. However, there is something you should remember: when faced with unreasonable celestial beings on the mountain who bully others simply because of their higher realm, mentioning your teacher's name may not suffice. Instead, use your master's name."

From this point on, the direct lineage of the Confucian Sage no longer needed to hide from the world.

Cao Qinglang nodded. "Got it."

Suddenly, Zuo You asked, "Can you drink?"

Cao Qinglang blushed and replied, "I’ve had some during my travels, but I don’t really enjoy it."

Zuo You laughed. "That’s great. Don’t turn into a drunkard like your master."

You should learn from my master instead.

Cao Qinglang then asked, "I still have some academic questions. Are you busy, Master?"

Zuo You said, "There’s nothing more important than studying. Just ask away."

In the end, Zuo You only stayed at Laopojiao for a mere two days.

The realms of heaven and earth are interconnected.

Zuo You then retracted his sword energy, wielded his sword, and set off on his journey, covering thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.

As he passed through the central region of Baoping Continent, he heard a voice that succinctly conveyed a principle to him, causing Zuo You to furrow his brow.

"The Confucian lineage already has disciples of the next generation. Is there a capable one among your peers known throughout the world? So that in the future, the old and decrepit won't dare to bully others at will?"

This principle was something that Cui Chen had mentioned while holding the White Jade Capital.

Thus, Zuo You ultimately turned his sword point not towards the south to Yulong City, but instead crossed the sea to travel directly to Posa Continent.

Xiao Xian was just about to ask Chen Chuan'an, who was renowned for his martial prowess, when he was suddenly interrupted.

In the expanse of heaven and earth.

The sword light arrived.

Xiao Xian was struck down from the sky, tilting at an angle, and in an instant, he crashed into the depths of the sea. The sword light split the ocean, piercing through both Xiao Xian and the mountains beneath the sea.

Xiao Xian asked me for a punch, coming from behind.

Zuo You returned the favor with a sword, bright and upright.

Whether or not to receive it, it was unavoidable.

In this wild world, you might not even be able to handle it.

With the cave heaven and blessed lands established, Zhu Lian felt a weight lifted off his shoulders.

It seemed that all the confounding issues had been resolved, and all that remained was for the Young Master to return home.

However, just as Zhu Lian's mood improved, an unfortunate event occurred. He cursed under his breath, realizing that one should never get carried away.

A Sui girl had left just a few days prior, and now another one had arrived.

Zhu Lian noticed an anomaly in a scroll on his desk and cursed, "Damn it," tossing in a grain of Gu Yu coin.

Fortunately, it was the least valuable of them all; he only needed one.

Moreover, she was not entirely a martial artist, which had its advantages.

After dying once and emerging from the scroll, she did not harm the roots of the Dao.

Sui Youbiao emerged from the scroll, exuding a heavy aura of killing intent.

Clearly, she had not spared her enemies in the battlefield of Yulong City, leading to her demise and loss of her Dao.

Sui Youbiao's killing methods were unlike those of Zhu Lian or Wei Xian, resembling more those of Lu Baixiang. So she certainly wasn't seeking death but was caught in a bloody situation, surrounded by peril.

Zhu Lian continued to curse, "Why learn from someone else? Why imitate your master’s reckless fighting style? Acting all high and mighty, thinking you’re some kind of Confucian sage in the world of Haoran? And what’s the outcome? I don’t care to discuss your fate, but as a direct disciple, shouldn’t you know better?"

Sui Youbiao's eyes turned icy, her killing intent surging even more.

Zhu Lian glared. "What’s wrong? Did I say something wrong? Or was I right?!"

How dare you scare me, you reckless woman? In these years in the Yuguizong and Zhenjing Sect, how many celestial coins have you earned? You’re not even as good as Lu Baixiang or Wei Xian.

Although this woman had a heavy killing intent, her heart wasn’t too dark, indicating she still had some conscience.

Otherwise, Zhu Lian would have truly feared that he might lose control and send her back into the scroll!

A Golden Core realm sword cultivator, did she really think she was so impressive?

Others might not understand why she had visited the Ascension Platform and why she couldn’t break through to the Nascent Soul realm, but Zhu Lian knew all too well! Others might not know why you, Sui Youbiao, wanted to ascend, but I, Zhu Lian, who once roamed the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, had combed through historical records and tales for years, and I knew exactly why you insisted on wielding your sword to ascend!

It was to fulfill the wishes of your deceased husband.

Zhu Lian also understood why Sui Youbiao treated the Young Master differently.

It was due to that Daoist priest known as "Old Heaven," who deliberately altered Sui Youbiao's memories, making Chen Ping'an bear a resemblance to her master.

Sui Youbiao clearly knew of this matter long ago, but because of an inability to let go and a reluctance to discard old ties, she pretended as if nothing had happened!

When you were in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, even if you single-handedly wielded your sword and made the heroes of the world bow down, did you dare to openly declare your affection for your teacher?!

Among the four from the scroll, including yourself, who hadn’t been manipulated by that old Daoist with a foul reputation?! The old master was immensely skilled, and with his cunning schemes, all four of you had to hold your noses and accept it.

Wei Xian treated that little Pei Qian like his own daughter!

Lu Baixiang was infatuated with the game of chess, and upon arriving in the world of Haoran, he was determined to become the lord of Baidi City, along with Cui Chen, and to truly become a formidable figure in the demonic Dao!

As for me, Zhu Lian, I can only express my pity.

I have always been unsure of my true self, and the cycles of life and death have led me into a maze!

Sui Youbiao no longer wanted to argue with Zhu Lian, saying simply, "I need to return to Yulong City again."

Zhu Lian replied, "How many lives do you have left to act recklessly? You died back in the Blessed Land, yet you could come into this scroll. If you were to die again, who would collect your body?"

Sui Youbiao retorted, "Why do you care?! Among the four of us, you, Zhu Lian, are the one most prone to creating troubles for no reason!"

Zhu Lian grinned, "My Young Master cares, he would be upset over a Gu Yu coin. Let me warn you, when it comes to serious business, my Young Master has never suffered a loss. Don’t let your case be the exception."

However, this silly woman, Sui Youbiao, had indeed said something insightful.

Sui Youbiao prepared to fly off on her sword.

Zhu Lian suddenly said, "He would care about the money, but he would regret it."

Sui Youbiao snorted, striding away, yet she did not leave the mountain on her sword. She had a place to stay on Laopojiao.

Zhu Lian clicked his tongue in admiration.

In the small town of Huaihuang County.

Today, after the New Year's money exchange shop on Qilong Alley closed for the day, the long-lived Daoist friend did not return home but instead picked up the remaining pastries, gazing at the shopkeeper, Shi Rou, who was counting the accounts behind the counter.

Shi Rou looked up; over the past few days, it had been the same. This long-lived Daoist friend who referred to herself as "Ling Chun" always looked at her with a gentle smile.

Both had long known each other’s backgrounds. Shi Rou understood why this unrecorded long-lived sister of Laopojiao had such a strange look in her eyes. Previously, the long-lived sister had hidden some of her cosmetics, which Shi Rou had already seen.

The long-lived sister had even explained to Shi Rou why she went by the name "Ling Chun," saying that if one had a Ling Chun tree and a few branches of osmanthus at home, it was a good omen. It was certainly better than the saying "good people do not live long," which was too clichéd. In the future, the Patriarch's hall would still use the name "Long Ming," after all, that saying didn't sound good. But what could be better than "good people live long"?

Shi Rou glanced outside; no one was passing by.

Only then could she no longer suppress her curiosity and asked with her heart, "Sister Long Ming, what’s wrong?"

Using heart communication had its advantages; Shi Rou could restore her female voice.

Dressed in a snow-white robe, Long Ming had employed a concealing technique. To the ordinary townsfolk and lower-tier cultivators, she appeared to be a plain-looking woman, seemingly in her twenties.

Long Ming pinched a piece of pastry, covered her mouth with her hand, and after finishing it, wiped her lips with her thumb and smiled, "Shi Rou, do you remember how you were once refined by that Liuli Xianweng, turning you into a colorful-clad, skeletal lady ghost? Later, you followed the mountain master, gaining fortune from misfortune. After so many years, you’ve worn this guise of an immortal's shed skin. Have you forgotten many of your old habits? I mean some of those little habits you had since childhood, the insignificant ones, like..."

Like how you would bite your fingers when nervous, or how you could endure the scorching heat but could hardly bear a slight chill, or how you had a natural fondness for ancient music. These were all things Long Ming had learned from the archives after receiving hints from Old Yang. It wasn’t hard to find—just that the ancient Shu region's incense was thin, and there were some relations with the three teaching masters of the White Jade Capital... The characteristics Long Ming thought of were precisely due to a certain lineage that naturally bore Dao seeds, awakening early but never truly practicing the Dao.

However, Long Ming did not voice her questions, only smiling at Shi Rou.

Shi Rou looked pitiful and asked, "For example, what about it? Sister Long Ming, please don’t scare me."

It wasn’t that she was intentionally hiding something; in fact, she had nothing to hide anymore. Besides, with Cui Dongshan around, what could she possibly conceal? She had grown used to the peaceful days in Qilong Alley. Every night, she could shed her shed skin for a moment and return to a feminine form—after all, a ghost was still a woman. Moreover, she had resumed her focused cultivation, accumulating slowly, and steadily improving her realm without worries; no one would ever hold her realm against her. Shi Rou truly had no distracting thoughts, and the peaceful days, which resembled one another, made her exceptionally content.

As for the secret lineage that Cui Dongshan had revealed long ago, Shi Rou truly didn’t want to say much. Why discuss it with Long Ming? Besides, if Cui Dongshan knew, wouldn’t that mean half of Laopojiao was aware? Surely not even the mountain master would be ignorant of it? In the past, because of the folk song of her hometown, Cui Dongshan had caught onto her lineage so quickly, calling her a "descendant of a fallen nation from six hundred years ago," and "the dying embers of a Daoist side branch," even claiming he understood the unique secret art of her lineage’s "ancestor of revival," and that he would "completely erase a portion of her Dao seed's spiritual light"...

To be honest, Shi Rou had been terrified at that time.

As for now, it was whatever; she was just the substitute shopkeeper for a New Year's money exchange shop, helping Laopojiao and Cui Dongshan’s master earn a few hard-earned coins daily. She practiced diligently at night; what more did they want from her?! If they really upset her, she would go and complain to her master! It didn’t matter if he was Cui Dongshan or some big white goose!

Long Ming gazed at Shi Rou for a moment before smiling and saying, "I see, this Cui Dongshan is indeed quite interesting. Quietly doing good... without leaving a name? If he weren’t the direct disciple of the mountain master, someone completely trustworthy, it would indeed raise concerns."

Long Ming smiled and said, "It seems I misunderstood you. I won’t mention those inappropriate words about you, Shi Rou. However, you may mind; just be careful not to let me discover how much you mind, or it would put me in a difficult position."

Shi Rou’s lips trembled, both afraid and aggrieved, timidly saying, "Sister Long Ming, please don’t scare me."

Having finally found a confidant, why had it suddenly changed like this?

Long Ming sighed, "I’ll write a letter for you, first asking for the opinion of that Cui Xianshi. If it’s feasible, we’ll fish for big ones; if it’s not advisable to act rashly, we’ll put it on hold for now..."

At this point, Long Ming extended a finger, a golden light suddenly pressing against Shi Rou's forehead, and she smiled, asking, "Three Teaching Masters, what do you think?"

Shi Rou immediately fainted, her body shimmering with seven colors.

Outside, a head poked in, and after looking around, a young man in white stepped over the threshold. He clapped lightly, a radiant smile on his face as he said, "Sister Long Ming has good intentions, good skills, and great courage! My master is truly fortunate to meet such people!"

Long Ming frowned. "Since both sides are already aware of each other, may I ask, Cui Xianshi, why have you allowed Lu Zhangjiao to observe from afar until now?"

Cui Dongshan leaned over the counter, stretching his neck to look at Shi Rou, who was lying behind the counter, while turning his back to Long Ming. He snapped his fingers and Shi Rou abruptly jumped up from the ground, then landed heavily, laughing, "Don’t worry, Lu Zhangjiao has one good trait: he’s always willing to lose in major matters. As for the trivial ones, he really can’t be bothered to scheme. At most, he’ll take a look at the scenery of Qilong Alley when he’s bored. Each time he employs the technique of observing mountains and rivers, crossing two worlds, he sees little and expends much. This is inherently a kind of gift to Shi Rou. It’s just that Shi Rou is too foolish to notice."

Cui Dongshan leaned on the counter, his feet off the ground, and turned to smile at Long Ming, the youth saying cheerfully, "I swear on heaven and earth!"

Long Ming shook her head. "Even if Lu Zhangjiao is caught in a scheme, he is a divine being with a heavenly heart. He may not catch it once, but after several times, he will still sense your schemes."

Cui Dongshan nodded vigorously. "And then? There’s still a world between us. Even if he were to come here in person, he would still be suppressed at the Ascension Realm, and merely observing mountains and rivers should be calculated as a celestial being's realm. When he comes to engage in mental calculations with me, can he win?"

Cui Dongshan shook his head vigorously. "He really can’t."

Only then did Long Ming gently nod but then said, "I will relay this matter to the master in full."

Cui Dongshan performed a bow, saying, "With such support from the master, the burden on my shoulders is halved."

Long Ming felt somewhat helpless.

Suddenly, Long Ming asked, "Did you predict that I would probe Shi Rou today?"

Cui Dongshan raised both hands; his snow-white sleeves were indeed too large, covering his face. After taking a breath, he put one hand down and vigorously patted his chest, "I swear on heaven and earth, I was just taking a chance!"

Long Ming fell silent.

Cui Dongshan pointed at his head, sighing, "It’s not entirely reliant on luck, after all, I’m not Li Huai. You, with such an existence, residing in Laopojiao, how could I neglect you? Don't blame Wei Ban for leaking information; aside from Wei Shanjun, you actually haven’t uncovered all the spies I’ve placed here, so I’m just using intent against intent..."

At this point, the young man in white began to shake his head and sway, casually saying, "What nonsense about not letting Sister Long Ming mind, I won’t say anymore. But you can mind; just make sure I don’t find out you mind too much, or it would put me in a tough spot."

Long Ming couldn't help but smile. She felt more at ease.

A Jade Purity realm cultivator could completely conceal himself beside her? No wonder he dared to say he was plotting against Lu Chen.
Cui Dongshan backflipped onto the counter, landing with both feet together right on Shi Rou's face. He shook her vigorously, yelling, "Wake up! As a female ghost, I can tolerate you sleeping in during the day and slacking off without earning any money, but at night, you better hurry up and scare some people!"

Chang Ming reached up, rubbing her forehead. Was Cui Dongshan such a rogue even in front of their master?

Cui Dongshan squatted down, and soon the sound of slaps echoed, followed by the distinct noise of Shi Rou waking up, startled and bumping into the cabinet. It seemed that this white-clad youth had truly been frightened to the core.

In the end, Cui Dongshan stood on a small stool, wiping the counter with his sleeve, while Shi Rou stood a short distance away, her head lowered and silent.

Cui Dongshan turned to the side, scolding, "Is my master unwilling to see you, which is why he hasn't returned home yet?! What are you, some half-man, half-ghost, neither male nor female? If it were me, I'd find it equally off-putting, and I'd avoid seeing you if I could..."

Chang Ming frowned, saying, "You'd better not say such things. I can assure you that if Chen Ping'an were here, he definitely wouldn't let you speak like that!"

Calling out Chen Ping'an's name so casually was a first for Chang Ming, indicating she was genuinely upset. She was prepared for the worst, expecting to fall out with Cui Dongshan.

Unexpectedly, the white-clad youth suddenly stopped his rant, sighed, and bent his knees, resting his head on the table. "As long as Master is here, I wouldn't mind if he scolded me once or even hit me a hundred times."

Chang Ming chuckled, "He will come back."

Cui Dongshan flailed his sleeves across the counter, wailing dramatically.

Suddenly, he stopped, asking, "Are we leaving the mountain soon?"

Chang Ming nodded.

Cui Dongshan hopped off the stool and swaggered around the counter, saying, "This master uncle is being outrageous—coming and going without so much as a word. Next time we meet, I'll jump up and give him a good punch!"

Watching that white-clad youth sway out of the shop, Chang Ming couldn't help but frown. It was normal for cultivators to have odd quirks, but one as eccentric as him was quite rare.

Cui Dongshan suddenly poked his head back through the door. "Sister Chang Ming, how about you come and be the Grand Law Master of Lupo Mountain?"

Chang Ming laughed, "You don't get to decide that."

Cui Dongshan replied, "You don't know! Master favors me the most among his students. Pei Qian and the others combined are no match for me."

Chang Ming smiled sweetly, "Then please roll away."

Cui Dongshan grinned, "Then I really will roll away!"

Chang Ming extended a hand.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily as he left, spinning sideways down Qilong Alley, his wide sleeves fluttering beautifully, leaving just as quickly as he had arrived.

Arriving at Lupo Mountain, Cui Dongshan hadn’t taken the main road but had climbed up instead. Thus, he startled Zhou Milin, who was snacking on sunflower seeds, making her jump at the sight of his head peeking over the cliff. The little girl stared for a long while, dumbfounded.

Zhou Milin dashed over, crouching down to peek around. "Big White Goose, where's Pei Qian? Why isn't he back home with you? Don't you guys often hang out together?"

As Cui Dongshan climbed over the cliff, Zhou Milin stood up, handing him a handful of sunflower seeds, then chuckled, "I'm not bragging; I was just a little startled when I saw you earlier."

Cui Dongshan beamed, "Little Milin is looking good, growing up!"

Zhou Milin stood on her tiptoes and laughed heartily.

Cui Dongshan ruffled Zhou Milin's hair and gazed into the distance. Suddenly, he bounced up and shouted, "Listen well, world of righteousness! Today I startled Little Milin just a bit, so when Master returns home, he must give the whole world a big scare! Damn it, and that includes the wilderness and the Azure Clear world too!"

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 843: I Am Dongshan**

Cui Dongshan finished his grand declarations with a light nod, clearly pleased with himself. Since no one objected, he took it as an agreement from the three realms to this matter.

Zhou Mili, clutching a golden shoulder pole and a hiking staff, pulled out the lively plaque of the Right Protector of the Fallen Mountain and clapped her hands cheerfully.

Cui Dongshan followed the six green stone tiles laid on the ground and performed a series of exaggerated movements, striking a pose that exuded confidence. It wasn’t a martial stance, but rather a series of flailing sleeves, making a raucous sound.

With both feet firmly planted on the ground, he faced the bamboo tower, turning his back to Mili. Suddenly, he twisted his waist and threw out a punch, noticing that Mili seemed a bit dazed. He couldn't help but remind her, “Take this punch! Unmatched under heaven and earth!”

Mili quickly spun around in place several times before sincerely exclaiming, “Good punch!”

Cui Dongshan shook his sleeves, his face full of regret. “Who would have thought that even after mastering this unparalleled fist technique, I still couldn’t defeat the Right Protector? Alas, let’s call it a draw and save the rematch for next time.”

Mili scratched her face, feeling a bit unsatisfied since she hadn’t even thrown a punch herself.

Cui Dongshan swaggered over to the stone table. Mili hurriedly placed their treasured items on the table and began pulling out handfuls of sunflower seeds, piling them up in front of the big white goose. She kept at it for a while until there was finally enough for them to use.

As he cracked open the seeds, Cui Dongshan casually asked, “Mili, has anyone been bullying you? Even if you're the water monster from Dumb Lake, if you’ve suffered even the slightest grievance, you must tell your senior brother! I may not have many skills, but I’m a master at cursing and blocking doors.”

Zhou Mili crossed her arms and raised her shoulders as high as they could go, almost towering over her head. She scoffed, “Big White Goose, you’ve been away too long, haven’t you? Your head isn’t as clear anymore; it’s only I who bully others!”

That’s why you all shouldn’t always enjoy wandering so much. If you go out and get bullied, I won’t be able to take care of you.

Cui Dongshan leaned in, munching on seeds, and continued, “Mili, as more people come to the mountain, even if they don’t wander far, there will be more and more things happening on the mountain. At that point, I might not have so much time to chat with you. Are you sad about that? Upset?”

Zhou Mili laughed heartily, “Big White Goose is talking nonsense! When I was a water monster in Dumb Lake for many years, no one chatted with me all year round. Why would I be sad?”

Cui Dongshan suddenly understood and said, “But those fleeting passersby aren’t your friends! If your friends ignore you, it feels different.”

Mili scrunched her brows, thinking hard as she counted her good friends one by one. Finally, she cautiously asked, “Can you at least say one word to me in a year?”

Cui Dongshan paused his seed-cracking and smiled, “You can count on that.”

Zhou Mili whispered, “Two words wouldn’t be too much, right?”

Cui Dongshan grinned and asked, “When will you take me to Red Candle Town and the Jade Liquid River for some fun?”

Zhou Mili blinked, “Let’s wait until the Good Person Mountain Master comes home and then talk about it.”

As long as she crouched inside the bamboo box of the Good Person Mountain Master, the black-clad girl could muster the courage of two grains of rice. As long as she knew the Good Person Mountain Master was on his way home, she would dare to go down the mountain alone to fetch him.

Cui Dongshan nodded, “No problem.”

He was furious, but he couldn’t scare Mili. Since the old chef had already returned to the Fallen Mountain to help sort things out, Cui Dongshan felt more at ease. What he could do now was to take it easy and fill in the gaps. Aside from helping Chang Ming with his small finishing touches, he also needed to deal with the two little miscreants from Hongxia. As for that newly arrived ruler from the Fox Kingdom, Pei Xiang, he would need to keep a watchful eye on her. The old chef was always soft-hearted with beautiful women, so it was better for Cui Dongshan to play the role of the bad guy.

Cui Dongshan had long since told his master that even if a mountain peak ultimately achieved the same goal, it needed to have multiple hearts involved, so that certain people could see things clearly and remember them well. Only then could they truly understand and appreciate it.

Among the many important matters, one was his suggestion for Chang Ming to temporarily take on the role of the Fallen Mountain’s Master of Laws.

In fact, according to the usual rituals of immortal sects, this was already a bit overstepping for Cui Dongshan. It wasn’t just a bold move; it was a direct challenge to the entire Master’s Hall. Forget about being held accountable later; he could get his feet chopped off and tossed out to be fed to the Left Protector of the Dragon Riding Alley.

So, this trip to the Fallen Mountain was not just a casual visit for Cui Dongshan.

At that moment, Chen Nanshu came running over, a jingling bunch of keys at her waist, chatting lightly.

The girl in the pink skirt greeted Cui Dongshan and quietly sat by the stone table.

Chen Nanshu might not get involved in major matters, but she knew all the little happenings on the Fallen Mountain.

Cui Dongshan and Chen Nanshu discussed some of the recent developments regarding Chen Lingjun in North Julu Prefecture. It wasn’t idleness; he had encountered quite a surprising turn of events.

Chen Lingjun had become close with a new friend, united by their common interests and willing to risk their lives for each other. However, due to this new brother, who had genuinely severed a chicken's head and burned yellow paper, the two found themselves detained by the Thunder God’s residence at Infant Mountain, located at the far west of Jidu.

The Dragon Palace Cave in central Jidu had sent two letters pleading for Chen Lingjun’s release, but neither had succeeded in convincing the Thunder God’s residence. They were understandably furious; while the sect didn’t suffer significant losses, the humiliation was immense. Who would have their signboard’s golden letters half-removed right at their gate?

You’d think even a fool would have some sense, right? If you’re going to steal, you might as well take the whole sign with you. At least then you could retrieve it later, but these two idiots only removed the “God’s Residence” two big golden characters...

After they apprehended the culprit, the reason given was, “I took down all three characters; I was afraid you’d beat me to death. Leaving one character is a way to keep a line open for future encounters in the martial world.”

This led to those two letters from the Dragon Palace being treated with great respect, but the Thunder God’s residence still didn’t release anyone. Nevertheless, the actions of the great immortals on the mountain were typically not overly harsh. They politely returned the letters with soft wording, merely stating that their esteemed guest from the Southern Xun Water Palace, a friend of the Dragon Pavilion Marquis, only needed to offer a simple apology, and they would not only release the person but also escort them out of the territory.

The crux of the issue was that this well-connected fellow maintained a stubborn stance, acting like a rogue, saying, “You can hit me, half to death even, but don’t think about an apology or admitting fault.”

Chen Nanshu looked worried and asked, “Did Chen Lingjun throw a fit and make a mistake?”

“Surprisingly, he didn’t mess up this time. That kid in North Julu Prefecture, rather than bowing his head, practically crawled on the ground, eager to stay hidden from everyone,” Cui Dongshan replied.

Cui Dongshan waved his hand and laughed, “It’s the Thunder God’s residence at Infant Mountain that’s poorly managed. They were at fault first, and it wasn’t a big mistake. It was just a small dispute in the martial world down the mountain. Someone was wrongfully harmed, a few people were injured, and they threw some divine money at the problem. Unfortunately, Chen Lingjun happened to witness it, but he couldn’t save anyone. His ‘friend’ couldn’t hold back and was the first to throw a punch, resulting in a chaotic brawl. Chen Lingjun’s new friend ended up looking like a mess, and the offending cultivator fled, which left Chen Lingjun even more furious. As for the immortals at Infant Mountain, they value their reputation and don’t believe that they did anything wrong. Since Chen Lingjun is an outsider, according to the mountain’s usual rules, this is just compounding the mistakes. He’s not foolish enough to storm the mountain gates after being turned away once or twice, so in the end, he and his friend decided on that approach.”

At this point, Cui Dongshan burst out laughing, “No wonder he’s got the spirit of someone from the Fallen Mountain; he does things with great satisfaction.”

Chen Nanshu said, “As long as there are no real dangers, that’s good.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “The two friends who sent the letters are not ordinary people. We can rest easy knowing Chen Lingjun is being well taken care of in the Thunder God’s residence. He’s having a good time with friends in there, and as for the waterway journey, it’s just a few river gods escorting him. Well, our Chen Lingjun is being protected by great nobles!”

After all, those two who sent the letters were currently from the leading factions of North Julu Prefecture, and they had to maintain their reputations.

Shen Lin, from the Southern Xun Water Palace, now held a divine position that hadn’t been seen for thousands of years, the Spirit Source Duke of Jidu.

The other one, of slightly lower rank but once a prominent river god, Li Yuan, was now the Dragon Pavilion Marquis of Jidu. Though the Duke had a higher rank, the territorial water domains broadly belonged to the east and west, each managing their own.

Zhou Mili listened intently, thoroughly impressed, “Chen Lingjun is quite well off! He’s really enjoying himself out there. I wouldn’t know how to make such influential friends.”

She just didn’t know if Chen Lingjun had mentioned that he had a good friend back home who was a water monster from Dumb Lake, capable of being quite fierce in the martial world.

However, Mili scratched her head, thinking that Chen Lingjun probably wouldn’t want to mention that. If he didn’t, it wouldn’t matter either. If Chen Lingjun’s new friends weren’t keen on hearing it, wouldn’t that embarrass him?

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “Exactly! Mili only recognizes big oaf Jun Qian and that big sword immortal, Table.”

Zhou Mili giggled, “And there’s also Liu Drowsy and Sister Hongxia!”

Chen Nanshu stifled a laugh and said, “Mili helped Mr. Zuo carry a chair to the entrance of the Master’s Hall at Jise Peak. After Mr. Zuo got up, she planned to carry it back herself, but Mili was fierce and loudly declared, ‘I don’t agree!’ making it awkward for Mr. Zuo.”

Mili quickly covered her mouth, laughing, “Where was I fierce? I wasn’t loud at all! Don’t say nonsense, Sister Nanshu!”

Chen Nanshu found it too amusing and couldn’t resist praising Mili again, “Mr. Cui, you don’t know. At that moment, Mili looked up, silently conveying that she was the one to carry the chair. That message was clear, and no one could argue against it!”

Mili waved her hands vigorously, “That’s not what I meant at all! Sister Nanshu is just talking nonsense!”

Cui Dongshan suddenly leaned back in shock, his face full of disbelief, “Mili, you’re remarkable! Don’t you know that outside of Mr. Zuo, everyone else is quite fearsome? Even your Good Person Mountain Master has never had a good expression around him. Just saying that in the city of the Dumb Lake water monster, the Sword Qi Great Wall has a renowned swordsman, Table, who, for any reason or none at all, just sends a sword flying outside the city walls, like cutting vegetables, slaying countless great monsters. Even the native sword immortals at the Sword Qi Great Wall fear debating with him and try to avoid him. Mili, what are you thinking? How do you have such great courage?”

Mili straightened up, furrowing her brows as she thought for a long time before nodding to herself, “Next time, I can agree.”

Nanshu, who was slowly cracking seeds, gently pushed some of the seeds toward the big white goose and Mili.

Cui Dongshan continued chatting with the two young girls while also thinking about some trivial matters in the back of his mind.

In this world, while matters were important, as long as the threads of fate were in his hands, everything else was just minor issues.

As for the appointment of the Spirit Source Duke and the Dragon Pavilion Marquis, the Central Land’s Cultural Temple had yet to voice its opinion; it seemed they were merely tacitly approving it.

The appointment of the Spirit Source Duke had been a monumental event not seen in three thousand years. 

Ordinary secular monarchs of a single region had no right to intervene in such matters; it was a fool's dream, and only the Central Land’s Cultural Temple had that authority.

However, the three factions of Dragon Palace Cave, the Great Source Dynasty’s Chongxuan Department, Floating Water Sword Lake, and Water Dragon Sect, were all actively promoting this matter, each contributing money, effort, and personnel, even constructing two grand temples. Of course, the Spirit Source Duke and Dragon Pavilion Marquis were considered half of their own people. No matter how their past relations had been, they could not fake their waterway operations. Not only would they be able to consolidate a region’s water transport, but they could also siphon water transport directly from the sea. Especially the latter, such a rare opportunity that even mountain cultivators would find difficult to grasp—who wouldn’t want to seize this chance and share in the glory of those two noble temples?

Zhou Mi, the head of the academy in North Julu Prefecture, not only did not oppose this but even handwrote two letters to the Central Land’s Divine Continent, one to the Cultural Temple and the other to his own master. He likely wanted to persuade the Cultural Temple to recognize this matter, hoping for a vice-master or a grand priest to come and officiate the appointment; an accompanying temple sage wouldn’t be enough.

However, what exactly was written in those letters, Cui Dongshan, being neither a vice-master nor a grand priest, had no way of knowing.

He could only guess, based on Zhou Mi’s temperament and the situation of the region.

In truth, whether connecting North Julu Prefecture with Baoping Prefecture or appointing the Spirit Source and Qi Crossing Dukes, it was the Baoping Prefecture pressing the Central Land’s Cultural Temple to tacitly approve these matters. What could they do if they didn’t acknowledge it?

But the sage Zhou Mi from North Julu Prefecture must have been the subject of many jokes lately. The fact that Zhou Mi, as the headmaster, had to rely on his master’s “fury” calligraphy must have been quite entertaining.

Cui Dongshan was actually quite familiar with him.

As for the Qi Crossing that belonged to his own Baoping Prefecture, the ceremony would be overseen by the elder from the Booklet Lake.

The old monk Ji Tang and Mr. Fan from the merchant class would be present to witness.

And this was just what was on the table; behind the scenes, there were also secretive returns to Baoping Prefecture by Li Liu and Ruan Xiu, the latter gazing across the water at Li Liu.

The young deity from Yang's Apothecary was also having Ruan Xiu bring a plaque and a pair of couplets as gifts for the grand ceremony of the Spirit Source Duke's temple.

“Qi Crossing Duke Temple.”

As if basking in the spring breeze, gentlemen continue the legacy, taking responsibility for the heavens and earth.

Calm and proud, the sages and virtuous govern the world, with literature conveying the way to open a peaceful era.

Both the plaque and couplets were composed of carefully chosen words, as if personally penned by the Qi Crossing Duke himself.

Inside the Spirit Source Duke's temple, there also hung a blank plaque, seemingly waiting for someone to inscribe it.

Perhaps it would say “Spring Welcomes the World.” Perhaps it would say “My Heart is Bright.” Who could say for sure?

Cui Dongshan leaned on the pile of sunflower seed shells on the table, feeling a bit bored. Where was the Sword Immortal Mi? Why hadn’t he come to catch up? This was a reunion of good friends; time was precious!

Why does the Sword Immortal of the Jade Purity Realm look down on a friend who's only one realm beneath him? 

A figure in a green robe approached the cliff's edge, a smile that didn’t seem entirely genuine on his face.

Mi Yu truly feared the great sword immortal Zuo; to be precise, it was a mix of fear and respect. As for the “handsome youth in white” before him, who kept silent yet had a sharp tongue, he was genuinely vexing.

Back in his hometown, he had lain drunk on the city walls, not bothering anyone. But then this guy passed by and dug a pit for him, forcing him to draw his sword against the local cultivators. Mi Yu counted that as a half-win since, after all, the locals hadn’t truly attacked him; they had underestimated him as a mere decorative pillow of the Jade Purity Realm. The big sword immortal, Yue Qing, however, had “lucked out” and ended up with the remaining half of the spoils.

So when Mi Yu discovered that Cui Dongshan had come to the mountain, he had wandered around the empty old Mountain God Temple at the summit, not expecting that Cui Dongshan could actually chat. Avoiding him seemed inappropriate, too deliberate, especially since the Fallen Mountain was about to open the Mirror Flower Water Moon, making money from those fairy sisters. Mi Yu wanted to pull this guy along with him. 

After all, one doesn’t get to know someone without a little conflict. Now they were like family. But Mi Yu felt he needed to tread carefully; Lin Junbi was a clever person. Just a few games of chess had led to Cui Dongshan being duped so badly. Mi Yu, being a lousy chess player, should be cautious.

Chen Nanshu tugged at Zhou Mili’s sleeve. Mili suddenly brightened up, excusing herself to help Sister Nanshu clean up the bamboo tower. If there was even a speck of dust on the desk, they would both be lazy together.

Cui Dongshan gestured for the great sword immortal Mi to take a seat, smiling brightly, “Great Sword Immortal Mi, long time no see.” 

Mi Yu had no choice but to sit down, facing the white-clad youth, keeping a respectful distance between them.
Cui Dongshan spoke with utmost seriousness, "I am Dongshan."

Mi Yu retorted, slightly annoyed, "We know each other well enough."

The clay idol still held a bit of anger; although he didn't count as a sword immortal, he was still a sword cultivator. Which sword cultivator in the world didn't have a bit of temperament?

"Then let's get to know each other better?" Cui Dongshan smiled with his heart voice. "My innate flying sword fills the sky with clouds. Before reaching the upper five realms, I secretly killed six times in the lower five realms. Especially when I was a nascent soul sword cultivator in the middle five realms, my attacks were the most ruthless, ranking second among sword cultivators of the same realm. I was the most willing to throw my life away because, in this place, the opposing demon clan wouldn't be too strong. Even if trapped in a dire situation, my brother Mi Hu could still save me, and we would both survive. After reaching the Jade Ripe Realm, Mi Yu's killing style suddenly changed drastically; he became timid, turning into a laughingstock in his hometown. The truth is, it's just that once Mi Yu finds himself in a life-and-death crisis, it could lead to my brother's death first. Even if Mi Hu were to die later than his younger brother, he would still likely die quickly in the next great battle, or suffer like that sword immortal Tao Wen or Zhou Cheng, living a life worse than death."

Mi Yu clenched his fists under the table, his face a stormy shade.

Cui Dongshan propped his chin on one hand, casually fiddling with sunflower seeds, and continued, "But it wasn't me who said this, it was my master."

Mi Yu sneered, "The Hidden Official would never be so boring!"

Cui Dongshan shook his head and switched hands to support his chin, "Exactly! I'm the one who's boring, that's why I pour wine on others' wounds."

Mi Yu shot back, "If you don't like me, just say so!"

Cui Dongshan shook his head again, "Quite the opposite. I dare not say that Mi Yu is a wronged hero in my heart, but I can say that sword cultivator Mi Yu is truly someone of flesh and blood."

Mi Yu felt weary but was serious about certain matters. 

So even with Cui Dongshan's explanation, Mi Yu's anger still flared, unable to strike back, not to mention he might not even win in a fight, and he certainly couldn't insult Cui, as he would definitely lose that battle too. 

Moreover, with their current statuses being so different from those of the past, Mi Yu felt even more stifled. 

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “The awkward thing is that Mi Hu's talents are too remarkable. Compared to his younger brother, he started training earlier and has a higher realm. So when will Mi Yu truly be able to unleash his skills and slay great demons?”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, “No chances left. With his current low realm, breaking through the bottleneck of the Jade Ripe Realm isn’t so easy. As the last remaining incense, he can’t afford to die; otherwise, how can he even hope to make up for the losses incurred by his older brother? It’s truly frustrating. If I were the Sword Immortal Mi, with a heart as open-minded as mine, perhaps I'd be even more frustrated.”

Cui Wei once confided to Cui Dongshan back in his hometown's Sword Qi Great Wall, “Why should I die here?”

Cui Dongshan fully agreed.

As for Mi Yu, Cui Dongshan recognized him even more. That incident on the city walls all those years ago was due to Mi Yu's own impulsiveness; he was merely fanning the flames on minor matters while letting the big things flow. After all, what of a person venting a few angry words? Clear-cut grievances are the mark of a true man. Those who fell on the battlefield like Yue Qing were the same, and so was the surviving Mi Yu.

Mi Yu, for the first time in his life, was furious. He fixed a blazing glare on the outspoken youth, his eyes red, and said in a deep voice, “Cui Dongshan, stop it!”

Cui Dongshan raised both hands, “Alright, alright. Is it unbearable to hear a few harsh words from a family member? When the world of Bao Ping Continent is peaceful, and outsiders use this matter to mock you, Mi Yu, while also mocking the entire dilapidated mountain, wouldn’t the great sword immortal Mi have to repeat this every day, sneaking out to stomp on people until their heads pile up like mountains, slicing through with his sword?”

Mi Yu unleashed a fierce sword aura, instantly shredding a large swath of white clouds beyond the cliff.

He even forgot about the heart voice.

Cui Dongshan squinted, raising a finger to his lips, “Don’t scare the warm tree and little rice grain. Otherwise, I’ll beat you half to death.”

Mi Yu's sword aura only half reached Cui Dongshan; the white clouds outside the cliff were shattered, but not a trace of sword energy reached the bamboo house.

Taking a deep breath, Mi Yu quickly restrained his sword aura, forcefully suppressing the rage boiling within him, though his face remained dark. He turned quickly, spotting the two little girls leaning against the railing on the second floor. Mi Yu forced a smile, waved, and rasped, “Just playing around, just playing around. Carry on with what you were doing.”

Cui Dongshan said, “When there’s great unrest in the hearts of men, it leads to difficult knots in their minds. I can fully understand that you, Mi Yu, have such a knot in your heart. If we were just ordinary friends, I wouldn’t even mention it. Every time we meet, it would just be laughter and joy, you eating sunflower seeds and me drinking. But…”

Cui Dongshan grinned, “But I’m never afraid of ‘what if.’ For instance, if your heart knot exceeds that of the dilapidated mountain, then I have to cut this matter off in advance.”

“A beautiful saying, when repeated in someone’s ear a thousand times, becomes tiresome and loathsome.”

“Similarly, a monumental heart knot, if someone speaks about it a few more times, will inevitably lighten a bit.”

Cui Dongshan delivered three statements in a row.

Mi Yu, having already grasped Cui Dongshan's intention after the first sentence, no longer felt much "difficulty in letting go." The second statement even seemed reasonable, but by the third, Mi Yu's anger flared once again, unable to hold back as he lowered his voice and cursed, “Shut your damn mouth! I’m not as petty as you think!”

Cui Dongshan smiled brightly, “Really? If you’re serious, then I’ll take you seriously.”

Mi Yu sighed, “I’ll keep that ‘what if’ in mind.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, “You can be taught.”

Mi Yu shot a sideways glance at the youth in white, “Are you always this good at irritating people?”

After asking, Mi Yu immediately answered himself, “No wonder you're the student of the Hidden Official; you haven’t learned anything good, just the bad.”

Cui Dongshan corrected him, “Not just any student, but my master’s prized disciple!”

With the master sister who loved to keep accounts temporarily away from home, today’s little junior brother had to find ways to make up for it.

Mi Yu hesitated, wanting to say something but holding back.

Cui Dongshan swept his sleeve across the table, pushing all the sunflower seed shells into the air, as if foreseeing the future, saying, “You don’t need to force yourself to be friends with me. No need for pleasantries or small talk. We’re family; even brothers can have disagreements, let alone you and I. If you trust your Hidden Official, I’ll help ease my master’s worries. We share the same general direction, so there’s no need for more. Forcing a melon, dipped in honey, will still taste bitter in the end; the sweetest first leads to the most troublesome bitterness.”

Mi Yu nodded, “That’s a good point.”

Perhaps it could be adapted and used to discuss with the female heroes.

Cui Dongshan leaned against the stone table, gazing out into the distance with a smile, “When the dilapidated mountain opens the mirror flower water moon, Sword Immortal Mi can certainly share this reasoning with the women. I’ll just be on the side cheering loudly and applauding, as if it were the first time I heard such wise sayings.”

Mi Yu sighed, “Annoying.”

Cui Dongshan replied lightly, “If the pages of books are burning, how can it be summed up with just one word—annoying?”

Mi Yu raised both hands, his face drawn in a grimace, “Cui Dongshan, Cui Immortal, Cui Grandpa, I’m scared of you, okay? From now on, when you come to the dilapidated mountain, I’ll definitely avoid you, I won’t annoy you at all.”

Cui Dongshan lifted his hand, his wrist unmoving while his palm swayed gently, smiling, “Sword Immortal Mi, don’t be like that. Right now, I only have the obedient grandson Cai Jing, adding more would only trouble me.”

On the second floor, Chen Nuanshu sighed in relief, as it seemed the two had reconciled.

Little Mi Li finally relaxed her tightly knitted brows, relieved that Yu Mi hadn’t gotten into a fight with the big white goose; that would have been hard to break up.

Little Mi Li’s feet hit the ground, and she softly asked, “Sister Nuanshu, why were they arguing?”

Chen Nuanshu rubbed Little Mi Li’s head, gently saying, “Mr. Cui and Mr. Yu are both adults, with their own worries, and it’s better to talk than to hold it in.”

Little Mi Li nodded vigorously, and then her eyes brightened, clearing her throat, she asked, “Sister Nuanshu, can I ask you an extremely difficult riddle? It’s not one that the good-hearted mountain master taught me, it’s something I thought of myself!”

Chen Nuanshu, curious, nodded, “Go ahead and ask.”

Little Mi Li burst into laughter, unable to contain herself, rolling on the ground as she held her belly, clearly that riddle had made her so happy she couldn’t stand it.

Nuanshu crouched down, waiting for Little Mi Li to finish laughing before asking what the riddle was.

As soon as Zhou Mi Li sat on the ground, just about to speak, she was overcome with laughter again.

Nuanshu helplessly said, “Well, I’ve got to get back to work.”

Zhou Mi Li took a deep breath, finally managing to say, “What’s something that’s good when held in, but bad when not held in?!”

Then the little girl rolled around on the ground in laughter.

Nuanshu rubbed her head; she knew the answer but pretended to think for a moment.

A few years ago, when Pei Qian was training, it was rare for her to get a two-day break and not go to the second floor.

Zhou Mi Li’s one and only time not going early in the morning to be Pei Qian’s doorkeeper led Pei Qian to find it strange. She ran to check the dilapidated mountain’s right protector, who was slacking off. When Nuanshu opened the door, they found Little Mi Li’s bedding supporting Zhou Mi Li’s head and hands, as if a little hill had formed, tightly wrapped.

When Pei Qian asked the right protector what they were doing, Zhou Mi Li grumbled that she should open the door first. Pei Qian lifted the blanket and was so overwhelmed by the smell that she hurried out of the room, leaving behind a Little Mi Li rolling in laughter on the bed, having already covered her nose.

At the cliffside stone table, the two fell into silence.

Cui Dongshan suddenly said, “If you let your emotions take over and smash the Temple of the Water God at Yuye River with a sword, there wouldn’t be a Yu Mi left today.”

Mi Yu shook his head, “I’m not stupid. The Hidden Official has always mentioned following local customs; I know the weight of the situation.”

Cui Dongshan turned his head.

Mi Yu continued, “Alright, I admit, I’m a fool.”

Cui Dongshan stood up, walked around half the stone table, and gently patted Mi Yu’s shoulder, “Mi Yu, thank you.”

Mi Yu asked, “Thank me for what?”

Cui Dongshan didn’t answer. The youth in white, hands tucked into his sleeves, looked like a drifting cloud, gazing out at the white clouds beyond the cliff.

The former youth in white, who had once followed the old scholar through the White Paper Blessed Land, saw it continuously expanded after being occupied by novelists. The White Paper Blessed Land could be considered one of the strangest top-tier blessed lands in the world. There were no fixed numbers in the vastness of heaven and earth; each novelist cultivator could write about people and events as long as it wasn’t ultimately edited out, allowing the blessed land to continually grow in mountains and rivers. 

Cui Dongshan had seen several “great works” within the blessed land, covering tales of mountain immortals and martial arts sects, but he found them lacking. He thought that those mountain immortals and martial arts sects had their shortcomings. Human hearts rarely changed; it was as if once you entered the mountains or joined a martial arts sect, time would pass, yet you wouldn’t truly live. Some personal sentiments, even with slight turns, seemed too rigid. The growth of those minor heavenly characters was relatively rich, but everyone around them—good remained good, and wise remained wise—always maintaining harmony. Such mountain sects and martial arts schools couldn’t withstand scrutiny; no matter how grand, they were just empty shells with many people. Once they left the White Paper Blessed Land, they would fall with a gust of wind.

“I’m not claiming to know everything about the White Paper Blessed Land, only that most of the situations are like this. The principles of the world need to be articulated clearly, and the proportions of size must be spoken of.”

“Do friends and chivalrous people around someone never make mistakes? Do mountain immortals never accidentally kill the wrong person? Each of them seems to be better than the moral saints of the vast world.”

“Are the people around that individual only friends because they’re friends of friends, becoming lifelong companions? Why are those who stand against them always the most treacherous, with few living splendid lives? Why can’t they earn respect elsewhere? Why do mountain immortals only associate with lush mountains and clear streams? When they descend to the world, if common folk can’t recognize the immortal money in their pockets and haggle for a jar of cheap wine, are they no longer immortals?”

“Could it be that this vast White Paper Blessed Land exists solely for those few minor heavenly characters?! What a grand path!”

At that time, the founding ancestor of the novelist had only laughed while stroking his beard.

The young patriarch beside him and several acknowledged “talented and gifted individuals” didn’t take kindly to an outsider revealing their flaws, and their expressions were not pleasant. They were just short of saying, “If you’re so skilled, then write it yourself.”

Otherwise, given the nature of the then-young Cui Zhao, he would have indeed come forth. 

To teach them what it meant to be an “ordinary person whose thick accumulation leads to a sudden burst of brilliance; that was the natural gift of Cui Zhao.”

Fortunately, the old scholar quickly smoothed things over, scolding his disciple, “What you gain from books is shallow. What do you know? Writing a novel is not as simple as tossing out a few lines of poetry. These grand works, often thousands or tens of thousands of words long, are quite different from your casual chatter.”

Then he helped praise those young talents, only pointing out a few small faults, which didn’t overshadow their merits.

The praise and constructive criticism from the literary sage, of course, outweighed the casual remarks of a young disciple. Those novelists didn’t bother to hold anything against Cui Zhao anymore.

Outside of the title of the literary sage’s top disciple, he was just another obscure junior, a nobody.

But Cui Zhao didn’t back down. At that time, still an unproven youth, he boldly made even more rebellious remarks that slapped faces, saying, “I’ve always felt that language itself is a cage. The words of the world are the great enemy of the novelist. Because the boundaries built by words are the invisible boundaries of our thoughts and desires. As long as we remain trapped within this, it’s hard to verify the great path.”

At that moment, only the old ancestor of the novelist nodded gently, looking at the young Cui Zhao with admiration. The old scholar grinned wide, showing half a smile but refraining from saying anything.

The ancestor cast a sidelong glance, thinking, well, at least he wasn’t going to nod.

Later, Cui Zhao’s reputation soared, living up to his title as the literary sage’s first disciple. Even later, Cui Zhao’s name became known throughout the world, generating splendid works, merely one of the “Three Glories of the Vast World.” Finally, his reputation fell into infamy.

The vast world knew of this, yet most had forgotten one detail. Cui Zhao had often taught on behalf of his master back in the literary sage’s lineage.

Cui Dongshan remained lost in thought, gazing toward the southern part of the Bao Ping Continent.

That talent would always be that Cui Zhao, regardless of whether he still counted as the literary sage’s top disciple. He would always be the “embroidered tiger of the Three Glories of the Vast World,” the great master of the nation of Da Li, who would never wish to merely add ornamentation to the world.

I am not.

Cui Dongshan chuckled, murmuring to himself, “I’m just Cui Dongshan, the innocent and naive youth Dongshan.”

Tomorrow will always belong to the youth. (Note 2)

Youth comes around every year, and I still remain one of them.

In truth, Cui Dongshan had thought about wanting to step aside. Cui Zhao hadn’t agreed back then, giving Cui Dongshan a reason he couldn’t refuse.

Cui Zhao was just like that, always calculating, forever including himself in the equation.

Mi Yu didn’t stir up trouble; he merely sat silently at the side, never taking the initiative to speak with the youth in white.

Cui Dongshan exhaled lightly, gently pushing a large expanse of white clouds away.

The immortal boasts, the clouds gather and scatter.

Then he turned to the little girl in black on the second floor, calling out, “Little Mi Li, I’m heading down the mountain. Ask the old chef to prepare a grand feast.”

Zhou Mi Li quickly asked, “How good will it be?!” 

Cui Dongshan imitated Little Mi Li, crossing his arms and furrowing his brows hard.
Zhou Mili waved her hand, "You’re such a child, my lord. Go on, go on, remember to come back early! If you’re late, make sure to take the mountain gate; I’ll be waiting for you there."

Cui Dongshan nodded, retreated a couple of steps, then leaned back and plunged off the cliff. After disappearing from sight, he suddenly soared higher, his body spinning and drawing circles in the air, reminiscent of an immortal riding the wind on a leisurely journey...

Zhou Mili sighed, truly the big white goose was acting childish again.

Mi Yu narrowed his eyes, watching intently. Wow, it seemed he was headed straight for the Water God Temple at the Yuye River. He let out a heavy sigh, frustrated, “You bastard, why didn’t you bring me along?”

Cui Dongshan did indeed head to the Yuye River, but not to the Water God Temple. Instead, he performed a concealment technique to hide his form and arrived above the Yuye River. With a flip, he dove straight into the water and swam over to the entrance of the Water Palace.

Finally, the young man curved his fingers and lightly knocked on the door, raising his voice to shout, “Lady Water God, open up, it’s Dongshan!”

Two spirit creatures guarding the Water Palace exchanged glances. Setting aside who this guy was and how he had silently bypassed the formidable mountain water barrier, they wondered why the door to the Water Palace was wide open, yet he was knocking.

At the Caotou shop on Qilong Lane, the blind old Daoist had been wearing a smile on his face for the past few years. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that sometimes he would wake up laughing from his dreams. Even his two disciples noticed that Jia Cheng had been cursing him less frequently. After all, “to hit is to love, to scold is to care; no scolding means no teaching.” Jia Cheng felt that his luck had turned—he was finally living the life a true immortal should enjoy.

However, the old man secretly reminded himself that no matter how good life was, he must remember the lesson of being under someone else’s roof. Some rules that worked well for him would need to be adjusted.

For instance, if he was in a bad mood, it was fine to give a few kicks to Zhao Denggao, that little brat with a dubious background. But the once-frequent heavy-handedness was now out of the question.

As for that girl, Tian Jiu’er, he could hardly scold her at all. After all, she was the most beloved disciple of the young mountain lord, and every time she visited Qilong Lane, she would call him “Jiu’er Sister.”

Today, the weather was quite pleasant, and the business at the Caotou shop was still mediocre. It was manageable, considering that aside from the few items left over from the mountain, everything else was either from the leftover goods at Niu Jiao Mountain's Baggage House or consigned by a girl named Ma Duyi. That girl, even if the old Daoist was blind, he could tell at a glance that she was of extraordinary origin after years of battling demons and safeguarding the righteous path. Pretending to be blind… well, he truly was blind and just feigned ignorance.

The old Daoist stood with his hands behind his back and happily moved to the neighboring New Year’s shop. Unfortunately, that Daoist Lingchun was temporarily absent.

As an elder immortal of Longmen Realm, with unparalleled divine abilities, once his “heavenly eye” opened, he could discern the approximate appearance and figure of Daoist Lingchun.

Shi Rou stood behind the counter, too lazy to even glance at Jia Cheng.

What could this crafty old Daoist do? If he hadn’t gone to Huanghu Mountain to cultivate, he would have spent his days here idly chatting and flipping through ancient histories, boasting about his illustrious ancestors. Now that he had achieved Longmen Realm, he immediately started showing off, even making Shi Dazhucai less willing to call out to him. It was as if they were supposed to look out for each other; a “Shi old brother” here and there just to flaunt his various mysterious skills of the Longmen Realm. If only he could just shut up!

If it weren’t for Shi Rou feeling sorry for Jiu’er and Denggao, she would have kicked him out long ago for daring to show his face.

The old Daoist leaned against the shop door, holding a jade bamboo fan, and smiled, “Shi old brother, why isn’t Miss Lingchun here today?”

Shi Rou remained silent.

The old Daoist opened the fan and waved it to create a breeze. After a moment of silence, the fan made a swishing sound, and he suddenly exclaimed, “Shi old brother, look at me, I’ve accidentally made a fool of myself! I’ve been down in the world for too long, focusing solely on subduing demons and protecting the righteous path, I almost forgot that I’m no longer aware of the seasons!”

Shi Rou merely smiled lightly.

The old Daoist looked relieved and closed the fan with a clap. It wasn’t surprising that Shi old brother felt so awkward; after all, both were nominal offerings of Luopo Mountain, but their realms were vastly different.

Jia Cheng walked slowly, commenting on the aroma of various pastries, pinching one off, knowing that Shi old brother was about to speak. He chuckled as he anticipated Shi Rou’s request to record the accounts for the month’s end.

“Shi old brother, you can charge double the price; that’s perfectly fine. After all, selling a few dozen or hundreds of pounds of pastries might not even compare to what I can sell in my shop,” Jia Cheng joked.

Shi Rou lowered her head and opened the account book. “No need for that.”

Jia Cheng smiled inwardly; Shi old brother was far too thin-skinned. Why was he still being formal with him? Even if he had become an elder immortal of Longmen Realm, wasn’t he still Jia Laoge from the shop next door?

Jia Cheng lingered in the New Year’s shop for about half an hour, not waiting for Miss Lingchun to appear. He then tucked the fan behind his collar, placed his hands behind his back, and leisurely strolled back to his own shop.

As he did, he “spotted” a young man in white casually lounging at the counter. Jia Cheng didn’t hesitate; he saw the old Daoist quickly switch the fan to his waist and hurriedly bow with excitement, exclaiming, “Master Cui!”

Cui Dongshan ignored him, simply telling Jiu’er, who was minding the shop, to go next door and have some pastries on his tab. No need for formality, or else he’d get upset with Shi Dazhucai.

As for Tian Jiu’er’s senior brother, Zhao Denggao, he had gone to Longquan Sword Sect to visit that Ruangong’s senior disciple, Dong Gu. They had hit it off, and Zhao Denggao often sought advice on cultivation matters from the latter. Jia Cheng, normally taciturn, was surprisingly more enthusiastic about this than his disciple, as if he were the one practicing cultivation. He privately urged Zhao Denggao not to be shy and to visit often, as that Dong immortal was a terrestrial immortal. Even if Zhao Denggao was a bit slow-witted, he could still benefit from the encounter, while Jiu’er could handle the shop on her own.

Once Tian Jiu’er left the shop, Cui Dongshan settled at the counter, eyeing the gaunt old man in an oversized robe. He chuckled, “What a fine elder immortal of Longmen Realm! With a weight of ninety pounds, half of that must be thanks to that magical robe. Jia old immortal, you’re not just wearing a Daoist robe; you’re wearing a pile of immortal money! Oh my, that robe is so big the sleeves nearly touch the ground; are you going to sweep the streets in Qilong Lane?”

Jia Cheng was sweating profusely and forced a laugh. “Master Cui, you’re just joking, right?”

The old Daoist wasn’t foolish. Over the years, whether in the small town or at the state capital or on the mountain, he’d picked up bits and pieces of gossip. No matter how far-fetched, he would analyze it thoroughly, thinking the best of good news and the worst of bad news. Caution was his foundation for navigating the world without capsizing.

As for Master Cui’s sarcastic remarks, they were quite refreshing, especially with the cool breeze on a hot summer day.

Jia Cheng didn’t feel even a bit embarrassed; if he dropped his pride, he wouldn’t bother picking it up. He could bend down easily!

Spending a little money on a few pastries from the neighboring shop could easily make up for it. Little did he expect that Lingchun would show up just then at the entrance of his own Caotou shop, leaning against the door, arms tucked into her sleeves, smiling sweetly.

What a pity.

When Jia Cheng was merely Jia Cheng, the old Daoist didn’t bother wasting more words. He lightly tapped on the counter and said plainly, “Are you aware of how sought-after Luopo Mountain’s nominal offerings are these days?”

Of course, the old Daoist was aware. When the ancestral hall of Luopo Mountain was built, even Lord Wei Dashi came to witness the ceremony!

Moreover, regarding the young mountain lord and Miss Ruangong’s affair, even if the old Daoist was truly blind, he wouldn’t be so foolish as to be blinded by greed; he knew everything clearly!

Just after making a trip to the Water Palace of Yuye River, Cui Dongshan slowly said, “You’ve taken in a good disciple; cherishing your broom is already quite generous for a nominal offering of Luopo Mountain.”

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan slapped the counter, startling the old Daoist, who immediately shrank his neck and bowed even lower.

Cui Dongshan jumped down from the counter, circling around the silent old Daoist, scolding, “What a waste! You’re too selfish; it’s simply not honorable! Have you grown tired of being an elder immortal of Longmen Realm? Are you like the old longevity star eating arsenic? How many pounds do you need? Give me a straight answer! Damn it, if I get even an ounce less from you, it means I’m just as selfish!”

Jia Cheng raised his head slightly, feeling anxious, and with a wronged expression on his old face, he trembled as he said, “Master Cui, I understand your intentions, but I’m struggling to express my feelings. Now that I’ve encountered Master Cui, I can’t afford to lose face. I must dare to speak about the difficulties our three disciples are facing.”

As he spoke about the bittersweet struggles, the old man rubbed his eyes, but he didn’t pause his words, “My Jiu’er’s physique truly aligns with the natural order; it’s not that I’m reluctant to part with this ‘heavenly material and earthly treasure.’ As a nominal offering, how could I be a person devoid of conscience? I’m incredibly grateful to Luopo Mountain and the mountain lord, wishing I could set up an altar at home and burn incense daily! If not for the mountain lord’s blessings, I wouldn’t have made it into the small Longmen Realm at Huanghu Mountain. I should be doing something practical for Luopo Mountain. However, the old Daoist traveled the world in his youth, fighting monsters and subduing demons. My heart was hardened; my skills were lacking, making me a laughing stock in front of Master Cui. I know very well the benefits from Jiu’er’s blood, but I fear this action could harm harmony. If the mountain lord found out, he might blame me instead. Otherwise, I would have long let Jiu’er undertake this task. Even if she’s unwilling, it’s too cruel if she doesn’t understand gratitude towards Luopo Mountain. As her mentor, I should not only demand a few pounds of talisman spring from her but also teach her the principles of being a person! No matter how much I cherish my two disciples, I can still make them endure some discipline!”

Of course, Jia Cheng was just rambling, purely nonsense. Not only did he put a tall hat on himself, but he also tried to smear Jiu’er’s reputation.

The truth was that the elder immortal of Longmen Realm, Jia Cheng, had only one real concern: he was afraid that the mountain lord, Chen Ping’an, would think this harmed harmony, making him appear insincere. Wouldn’t that be a massive loss?

Jia Cheng, though blind, wasn’t naive; he understood Luopo Mountain’s bottom line was to at least act with a conscience and be human.

As for the rest, any little tricks or cleverness wouldn’t cost him his position as a nominal offering at Luopo Mountain.

In fact, even now, the shrewd old Daoist still couldn’t quite grasp how the young mountain lord had, with a mere glance, taken a liking to their trio, allowing them to enjoy a meal at Luopo Mountain after a life of hardship.

Cui Dongshan tugged the old Daoist’s robe sleeve and took back the jade bamboo fan he had brought to show off, gently opening it while walking in circles, creating a pleasant breeze.

Master Cui didn’t speak, but the old Daoist had exhausted his “heartfelt words,” leaving him with no more courage or clever remarks.

Cui Dongshan said, “From today on, let Jiu’er regularly gather talisman spring; it will be of great use in the future. Just remember not to harm Jiu’er’s cultivation.”

The old Daoist bobbed his head like a chick pecking at rice, clasping his fists, “I will strictly follow Master Cui’s orders. I’ll help Jiu’er gather talisman spring and keep her well-being in mind. How could I bear to let her suffer? After all, she’s just like my own daughter.”

This Jia Cheng was muddled in his cultivation but not in his speech.

In reality, it was precisely because Jia Cheng was so shrewd that the old Daoist’s seemingly foolish choices caught the attention of Luopo Mountain.

Those two disciples had it rough under such a master, frequently subjected to beatings and verbal abuse. He could say the harshest things and wouldn’t hesitate to discipline his disciples, but there were some things Jia Cheng handled in ways that weren’t typical for a mountain immortal. For instance, taking in a disciple of mysterious origins and hiding her identity, or not selling Tian Jiu’er to the talisman sect.

Tian Jiu’er, the old Daoist’s disciple, was gifted with a natural talent; her blood was especially suitable for crafting talismans.

In past years, whether Jia Cheng was making money or pretending to be a Daoist master to swindle wealthy patrons, the talisman spring had always come in handy.

Yet, relying on genuine skills and trickery to accumulate wealth was worlds apart from selling Tian Jiu’er for a high price.

Cui Dongshan nodded, “Then it’s settled. I won’t disturb the old immortal’s cultivation any longer.”

Cui Dongshan tossed the fan back to the old Daoist.

Jia Cheng quickly caught it with both hands, as if it were a treasured item.

Cui Dongshan walked toward the door, glanced back at the longevity Daoist, and suddenly turned, “One pound of talisman spring, one small summer coin. Consider it a personal transaction between me and Miss Jiu’er, unrelated to Luopo Mountain.”

Jia Cheng immediately said, “That’s too much; two pounds of talisman spring, and you can have half a small summer coin. That’s already a breach of conscience for our Caotou shop.”

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Oh? How so?”

Jia Cheng straightened his back, seemingly embodying the demeanor of an elder immortal, and said, “All the immortal money belongs to Jiu’er. As her master, I haven’t done much for her. I feel quite guilty. If Jiu’er could rely on this immortal money to stand on her own without her useless master’s support and make some progress, that would truly be a blessing, wouldn’t it?”

Cui Dongshan pointed at the old Daoist, “Damn it, from now on, all the young people newly accepted by Luopo Mountain should come to learn how to talk from you!”

Cui Dongshan snapped his fingers several times, each time a small summer coin tinkling. Finally, a few summer coins floated towards the old Daoist, “These are a reward for you, so don’t hesitate to accept it. After all, our Luopo Mountain’s nominal offerings shouldn’t be walking around in tattered clothing, making a fool of ourselves!”

Jia Cheng immediately understood.

The robe could be changed; he should go out less in the future.

Cui Dongshan smiled at the longevity Daoist, “Sister Lingchun, shall we go for a stroll?”

Lingchun nodded with a smile, genuinely having a few questions in her heart. Since it was now appropriate to ask, there was no need for excessive politeness.

The two walked along Qilong Lane, passing several large houses that had become Lingchun’s property. 

With so much money and nowhere to spend it, Lingchun had even considered changing her appearance and identity to secretly buy several mountain tops in the west as her own courtyard.

Cui Dongshan reached a grain drying area, lowered his head, and smiled, “Sister Lingchun, any questions you have, feel free to ask.”

Lingchun didn’t take the rules of the ancestral master too seriously and asked, “Is that uncommon skin you’re wearing for the day you might have the chance to eat that young boy from Mud Bottle Lane… Wang Zhu?”

Cui Dongshan replied, “Hmm.”

But that was the worst outcome.

Now it was the best outcome.

When it came to dealing with dragon-like creatures, Cui Dongshan was “naturally” quite skilled. The old dragon, now residing at the Yuanshu Academy within the Piyun Mountain, had already experienced this firsthand.

However, the true dragon he intended to “overcome” from the very beginning was the last true dragon of the Lihu Cave Heaven—“Li Zhu.”

If it couldn’t be nurtured, it wouldn’t grow. Then let me, Cui Dongshan, take matters into my own hands.
Seeing that the situation was turning dire, Cui Dongshan steeled himself. Not only would he take down Wang Zhu, but he also intended to swallow the other five brats, the old Jiao from Huangting Kingdom, his two useless offspring, and those remnants and opportunities left behind in the ancient Shu territory, as well as the likes of Li Jin from Hongzhu Town and others. He wanted it all!

Changming spoke up, “At this rate, it’s becoming a burden. Ascending to the Flying Ascension realm will be very difficult. Old Mr. Yang will certainly not open the Ascension platform just for you.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head. “In this world, calculations favor completeness.”

Changming nodded in agreement. “I was overthinking it.”

Cui Dongshan cradled the back of his head with both hands and resumed walking, taking his friend Changming, who had already lost the position of the Mountain Master of the Fallen Mountain, along with him for a stroll.

Changming thought of the grass-roots shop and the talisman spring, chuckling, “Gaining without effort is indeed a bad habit. Over time, it truly becomes as light as a feather.”

Cui Dongshan remarked, “If you don’t invest, you won’t cherish it. The more you put in, the more you care. It has nothing to do with whether a person is good or bad. The same pot of wine, regardless of the circumstances—whether the price goes up or down—the taste and the pace of drinking will always be different.”

Cui Dongshan turned and smiled. “Changming, why don’t you tell me about your encounter with my master? Choose what you can share.”

Changming began recounting the tale.

Actually, there was not much he couldn’t say. Besides not mentioning his former master, the executioner, he also refrained from detailing the sewing process of the Hidden Official. Other than that, he had little to hide. 

For example, the existence of the sewing person’s core, the old hearer’s collection of disciples, and the origins of those demon clans imprisoned in dungeons—their backgrounds and how they interacted and fought with the Hidden Official.

The relic that Cui Dongshan possessed was, in a certain sense, the sewing person’s prized possession.

As for some cultivators’ skin, it had nothing to do with their realm; it was naturally suitable for use as talisman paper, which the sewing person excelled at. The “Talisman Beauty” made from fox skins in the Fox Kingdom of Qingfeng City barely compared.

The sewing person selected cultivators, killing them and skinning them to store the talisman paper. They might either use it to draw talismans themselves or sell it at a high price to demonic cultivators.

Thus, the sewing person was ranked among the Ten Evil Cultivators alongside the lone rider from the South Sea and the flower thief, and thus was loathed by all, not without reason.

After Cui Dongshan listened to the stories, he slowly said, “The sewing person shares some similarities with the executioner. The lone rider of the South Sea, who steals the world’s waterways. The traveler who triggers the passage of ghostly soldiers. The enchanting corpse who practices colorful refining arts and creates extravagant tents. The flower thief, whose corpse is heavily rewarded by the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land. The plague god, destined for a life of misfortune. The debt collector loathed by the Yin-Yang School. The ferryman who helps others through life’s difficulties, but at the cost of their three lifetimes of fate… Except for the poisoned immortal I haven’t yet dealt with, I’ve encountered everyone else in my lifetime. I’ve even seen that rare ‘Ten Bandit Candidates’ mirror seller, and I spoke with him a few times in the Chan Juan Cave Heaven.”

Cui Dongshan’s expression remained calm as he shared with Changming some tales of old friends. “I once rode the winds over the South Sea with the lone rider. I once stood by the traveler’s side on horseback. I once drunkenly lay in an extravagant tent, discussing the sage's teachings with that enchanting corpse until dawn. I once gifted poetry to the flower thief. I once heard the sorrowful sobs of a young plague god. I once haggled over accounts with that debt collector. I once asked the ferryman what to do if the traveler had no next life. I once asked the mirror seller if he could truly refine the glowing bright moon into a makeup mirror, and who I could see when I looked up.”

At this point, Cui Dongshan suddenly burst into laughter, his eyes brightening a touch as he looked up and said, “I once stole the lady’s hair from Green God Mountain with Ah Liang in the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven. Ah Liang swore to me that it was the best material in the world for refining ‘emotions’ and ‘wisdom swords.’ Later, when our location was leaked, that damned Ah Liang ran off without a second word, casting a binding spell on me to face the furious lady of Green God Mountain alone.”

“I also journeyed with my junior brother Zuo in the Chan Juan Cave Heaven. We first stopped by the Manzhang Blessed Land and the Qingxia Cave Heaven before taking a detour to Chan Juan Cave Heaven solely because Zuo was stubbornly uninterested in the place. Because of Zuo’s insistence, I still haven’t visited the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land. Chan Juan Cave Heaven is a place that cultivators about to become immortal couples yearn for dearly! At that time, the fairy by our side was nearly in tears, wondering how to convince Zuo to take us there.”

“Inside, there’s a city called Xijing, said to be the most efficacious place for lovers. Even those suffering from unrequited love can come here to burn incense and make wishes, not only hoping to become a couple but also to grow old together. I remember the temple maiden, a beautiful girl holding a peach blossom fan, painted with a bright moon and inscribed with bamboo branch poetry. Her name was Chen Xi. She was graceful and charming. It’s said that when Bai Ye was still only a poet and not a sword immortal, he traveled to Chan Juan Cave Heaven with his friend Jun Qian, and out of hospitality, he wrote on the fan himself. In truth, Bai Ye and his friend Liu Sixteen didn’t have any money, so they couldn’t enter Chan Juan Cave Heaven. Bai Ye had to sell poetry to earn the fare. That’s why the entrance to Chan Juan Cave Heaven now bears the inscription ‘Thousands of Hearts Under One Moon,’ a line written by my junior brother Jun Qian. Who could have guessed?”

“When they were about to leave Chan Juan Cave Heaven, the fairy quietly asked Zuo if the temple maiden wasn’t that pretty, right? Zuo replied that she was quite attractive. Behind Zuo, there was a girl smiling like a crescent moon, while the one beside Zuo was not as cheerful. When Zuo then remarked that looks had nothing to do with him, the two girls’ moods flipped.”

“After the fairy left, I jokingly scolded my junior brother, asking if he was a fool and urging him to open his eyes. He laughed and replied, ‘Do you really think I’m naive? Don’t you see that the fairy who likes you is subtly probing, worried you might be attracted to the temple maiden because she’s pretty? Isn’t it a bit shallow to think like that?’ I gave him two thumbs up, and my junior brother Zuo smiled brightly.”

Changming found this casual chat with Cui Dongshan quite amusing. 

Fortunately, they were not enemies. 

Someone who has experienced much and accumulated many stories can be the harshest when they choose to be.

As they walked past the Mud Bottle Alley, when they reached the old academy, Changming stopped and asked, “What about it?”

But Cui Dongshan didn’t stop; instead, he quickened his pace, his sleeves hanging low. “Nothing to say, really.”

Changming caught up and changed the subject lightly, “What did you do when you visited the Water God’s residence at Yuye River?”

Cui Dongshan replied, “Nothing much, just tugged at the Water Goddess’s hair and spun around a few times.”

Changming teased, “Can you even be considered human?”

Cui Dongshan responded, “It’s tough. Trust me.”

Changming sighed, “It’s hard not to trust Mr. Cui.”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “The remnants of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, and that Yunzi from Qingni Slope, I won’t go about being the villain anymore. It’s not tiring to hurry along, but chatting with others is the most exhausting. So I’d appreciate it if you, Changming, could take on the role of the villain. After all, you said it yourself: gaining without effort is a bad habit. But pay attention to one thing—don’t go overstepping with the girl known as Shijiao. The entire Fallen Mountain pretends she doesn’t exist, which is the way she feels most at ease. Privately, you should protect her a bit more. Just keep the balance; you know how to handle it. Otherwise, if my master gets angry, he might reason with you, at most scold you a few times. As for me, I doubt he’ll bother reasoning; he might just beat me up directly.”

Changming nodded. “Understood.”

The Yunzi from Qingni Slope on Gray Mist Mountain was temporarily in the Dragon Gate realm. In reality, she was a black snake from Chess Stone Mountain, but not a true mountain or swamp spirit; rather, she transformed from one of the black pieces in a game played by two immortal chess players long ago. With golden lines in her belly, she had already begun to take on the form of dragon scales. Compared to the water jiao in Hongxia, because of that game back in the day, the black pieces were extremely vicious, making the later “Yunzi” more cruel and unruly than the average mountain or swamp snake.

Finally, Cui Dongshan brought Changming to a shop by the Longxu River.

Liu Xianyang stood up, hands on his hips, laughing boisterously, “Dongshan, my old brother!”

Cui Dongshan swaggered in response, “Xianyang, my old brother!”

Liu Xianyang raised his hand high, and Cui Dongshan jumped up to give him a high-five, then silently gestured a question. This sister Lingchun? Hmm?

Cui Dongshan’s eyes answered: not this one, try another girl.

Liu Xianyang sighed dramatically and clasped his hands to Changming, saying, “Greetings, Miss Lingchun.”

Changming smiled and nodded, sensing that it was still polite but awkward with this person. Thus, she clasped her hands in return. “Greetings, Mr. Liu.”

She had already made up her mind: from now on, she would come here less often for any matter. Absolutely no visits unless necessary.

So Changming took her leave, heading to Gray Mist Mountain and Qingni Slope to attend to important matters.

Liu Xianyang and Cui Dongshan sat on a small bamboo chair. Liu Xianyang quietly reminded him, “Take it easy, bro; that chair you’re sitting on was once graced by our Dali Empress. It’s precious! If you break it, can you afford to pay back?”

Cui Dongshan raised an eyebrow, glancing at Liu Xianyang’s bamboo chair, chuckling but saying nothing.

Liu Xianyang laughed heartily, “What are you thinking, bro? Wasn’t that a little too improper? That chair? It was already hidden away by my master long ago.”

Cui Dongshan gasped. 

Incredible! No wonder he was Xianyang, my old brother!

If that old stick-in-the-mud Ruan Qiong heard this, he’d probably beat Liu Xianyang to a pulp!

Cui Dongshan chatted casually with Liu Xianyang, much like he had with Chen Lingjun when they were tipsy.

In the end, Cui Dongshan remarked, “Xianyang, what a nice name. A heart that blooms like flowers turning towards the sun.”

Liu Xianyang chuckled, “I never noticed until you mentioned it. I only remember that Old Yao said years ago that Yanshan clay is great for making ceramics, but it’s hard to find. Back when Chen Ping’an followed Old Yao into the mountains to search for clay, he had quite a tough time.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly smiled, “Bai Ye and Jun Qian are friends and are connected to you. How about you, Xianyang, and She Yue?”

“Xianyang, She Yue, both great names!” Liu Xianyang laughed. “I’m just reaching for the stars; it’s me who is reaching too high.”

From the looks of things, from the tone of his voice, he was already getting cozy with that She Yue, one of the ten most talented young women.

Liu Xianyang suddenly asked, “How does that She Yue look?”

But Cui Dongshan answered the question with a different one. “This girl is quite strange, born in the wilderness. Yet in Tongye Continent, she hardly kills anyone, only seeks people.”

Liu Xianyang slapped his knee. “What a good girl! So devoted! Isn’t your Xianyang brother right here? What’s she searching for?”

He quickly turned and handed a sunflower seed over, “Cui Ge, let’s snack on some seeds.”

Cui Dongshan took the seeds and then grabbed some for Liu Xianyang. “At least leave some for Xianyang, my bro.”

As Cui Dongshan cracked seeds, he bent down to gaze into the distance, casually asking, “Do you believe in fate? Are you afraid of the red thread?”

Liu Xianyang also cracked seeds, laughing. “I only look at whether the girl is good or not.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “Didn’t you leave out a word?”

Liu Xianyang nodded. “One word, but it counts as two, saves some effort.”

You only look at how the girl looks.

Cui Dongshan clapped his knee, “Xianyang, I’m not exaggerating; you’re scarily clever!”

Liu Xianyang, with a bashful expression, said, “If you change it to cute, it sounds better. To seek good fortune, you must find a good wife.”

Finishing his sunflower seeds, Cui Dongshan announced he was going home for dinner.

Liu Xianyang waved his hand, signaling he wouldn’t tag along for free meals.

Cui Dongshan stood up and had just taken a few steps when Liu Xianyang suddenly asked, “Is that She Yue looking for Liu Cai?”

Cui Dongshan slowly turned his head. “Yes and no. It’s hard to clarify.”

Liu Xianyang asked again, “How far is it from me? Can Mr. Cui let me catch a glimpse of Liu Cai from afar?”

Cui Dongshan shook his head. “Don’t get involved.”

Liu Xianyang continued, “Is it that I can’t get involved at all, or it’s just a larger cost for me to get involved?”

Cui Dongshan laughed. “Both are true, but the former is more prominent, so don’t overthink it.”

Liu Xianyang went “oh,” and stopped speaking.

Cui Dongshan didn’t use wind to return to Fallen Mountain but walked instead, finally sitting on the stone arch bridge.

There were no longer any old sword strips hanging below.

Cui Dongshan furrowed his brows tightly, hands tucked in his sleeves.

That She Yue looking for someone was indeed Liu Cai.

A person who was far away from his master yet seemed so close.

A person Cui Dongshan had guarded against for years, just in case.

Not because he felt anything strange about that person back then, but because that person’s messenger was too peculiar.

So whenever he had the chance, Cui Dongshan would discreetly ask about old stories from Tongye Continent.

Moreover, his master was quite willing to chat a few more words about that friend he had met during a long journey, which led Cui Dongshan to naturally learn more.

Thus, Cui Dongshan now roughly understood that before his master entered the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he had already met the future Liu Cai.

Not just met, but they were right there, so close they could touch!

And they were both sincere and dear friends; that person even genuinely hoped his master would become a pillar of support in a chaotic world.

Even as an outsider, just thinking about it, after so many years, even if he was only half a Cui Zhan, Cui Dongshan would feel a chill down his spine, his heart racing!

Back then.

His master roughly said, “Leave a little room; don’t try to take everything without compromise.”

That person laughed heartily, “Chen Ping’an, you’re actually avoiding that little bit.”

Let’s have you avoid it for a bit. Become that little bit.

Once you become that little bit, then come to use that little bit to kill the other.

Master Chen Ping’an and that future Liu Cai from long ago were practically facing each other discussing this matter.

This is the true scheme.

Back then, in Lizhu Cave Heaven, that string of candied hawthorns, wasn’t it enough, Zhou Zi?! How long will this go on?!

Cui Dongshan slapped the stone arch bridge, but suddenly restrained his strength, letting his palm and sleeve gently brush over the bridge’s surface.

Cui Dongshan spoke with his heart, “Li Xisheng, come settle the debt! Master’s fate and fortune are mostly in your hands. Since master didn’t accept your peach talisman, you should…”

Actually, Cui Dongshan was preparing to throw a tantrum and be a rogue.

This logic shouldn’t be spoken, but it was unavoidable.

Cui Zhan, that old bastard, knew about this, extrapolated more, and extended it further. That old bastard wanted Liu Cai to try it out and see how it went.

Cui Dongshan was unwilling to do so. Many things, if it were just about a fight, wouldn’t be hard at all. The problem was that Zhou Zi had set up such an elaborate scheme, and the entanglement would only grow larger. This was not some simple heart-to-heart in Shuijian Lake!

Li Xisheng smiled and appeared, sitting beside Cui Dongshan, nodding gently. “I can talk with Zhou Zi about philosophy, of course, but it won’t be for Chen Ping’an. But do you really look down on Chen Ping’an? Isn’t it inappropriate for students not to believe in their teacher?”

Cui Dongshan feigned illness, “I’m in the thick of it, so of course I can’t be as stable as you.”

Li Xisheng gently placed his hands on his knees, gazing into the distance. “Do you think Chen Ping’an has already guessed who Liu Cai is? Of course, he’s just taking a wild guess.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head. “My master’s mind is not unwell.”

Secretly harboring small schemes.

Planning to ask Li Xisheng for some auspicious words that align with his intentions.

Once, the embroidered tiger Cui Zhan was merely acting as a teacher on behalf of his master.

And the once-great leader of Baiyu Jing Dao was truly acting as a master to accept disciples.
Li Xisheng, however, did not allow Cui Dongshan to have his way. He merely chuckled and said, “Whether there’s such intent or not, does it really matter? That elusive ‘one’—is it so easy to evade or to eliminate? Even my master doesn’t believe it’s a sure thing. So I think we should just observe from the sidelines. If something truly arises, we can address it then.”

With a flick of his wrist, Li Xisheng tossed the golden mountain carp and the golden little crab into the water. Just as they were about to hit the surface, they suddenly reappeared in the distant Great Marsh (Dalu).

Li Xisheng smiled and said, “Transform into dragons.”

Cui Dongshan gazed longingly into the water.

Li Xisheng remained unfazed, adding lightly, “A person returning on a snowy night.”

Cui Dongshan, however, acted as if he hadn’t heard, remaining indifferent.

As Li Xisheng’s figure vanished into the Great Marsh, Cui Dongshan stood up expressionlessly. Riding the wind, he returned to Desolate Mountain (Luopo Shan) and spotted the little speck waiting at the entrance. He flicked his sleeve, sending a gust of air swirling.

No matter how many years it would take, there would always be someone returning on a snowy night.

To hell with the so-called ‘Zouzi’ or whatever ‘one’ business; I am Cui Dongshan! I am the East Mountain! 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 844: The Burden of Effort**

On the desolate peak of the Broken Fate Mountain, there were no significant events. Just as Zhu Lian and Pei Xiang had said, the weather was fair and pleasant, with the breeze blowing and rain pattering softly against the water—merely delightful sights to behold.

The tranquility of Broken Fate Mountain was certainly not due to its lack of conflict with the world, but rather because of the grown adults and elders, each in their various positions, sheltering the mountain from storms and hardships.

For instance, there was the sword immortal Mi Yu, who had already made a name for himself on the battlefield of the Old Dragon City, and the Nascent Soul swordsman Cui Wei, who was on his way to the frontlines.

At the summit of Broken Fate Mountain, even Pei Qian, who had once been only slightly taller than a grain of rice, was now deep in the central battlefield of the Golden Armor Continent. In her heart, she pursued a figure she regarded as both her master and a formidable rival—Cao Ci, the tenth-stage martial artist. Pei Qian chased not only the height of martial arts but also the tally of enemies slain on the battlefield. Even though she remained far behind Cao Ci, the gap still substantial, to her, learning martial arts meant she had to take action. Thus, the precarious half of the Golden Armor Continent had come to recognize that beside the renowned genius martial artist Yu Jianfu, there was also a young female martial artist named Pei Qian, whose talent was extraordinary. Particularly, her punches were exceedingly domineering, excelling at trading injury for death, and she preferred to actively seek out powerful demon adversaries—unfortunately, her encounters often led to demon earthly immortals meeting their end beneath her fists.

As the North Mountain region of the Dali Empire, which was half a land of dragon auspices, had yet to come into contact with the demon army, the recent three consecutive golden deluges had caused all cultivators to feel a lingering dread. Previously, the transformation of the Longxia into a river dragon had been a major event, but under the current circumstances of the continent, it no longer drew much attention. Moreover, with Wei Bai and Cui Dongshan, both of whom held official positions in Dali, covering up the incident in their respective areas, the celestial masters and wild cultivators remaining in the North Mountain region were still unaware of whether this river dragon had been secretly nurtured by the Longquan Sword Sect as a guardian offering.

Pei Xiang's fox kingdom had relocated to Broken Fate Mountain, chosen for its lotus root blessed land. Meanwhile, Xu Hun from Clear Wind City had to rely on his military exploits in Old Dragon City to repay the Dali Empire’s ascension platform debts. Thus, even though the Xu family lady from Clear Wind City had some suspicions, there was nothing she could do for the time being—she could only wait anxiously for the outcome. Xu Hun, the city lord, gave outsiders the impression of being solely focused on his cultivation, unfamiliar with mundane affairs, resulting in significant power falling into the hands of women. However, Pei Xiang and Madam Yan were well aware that the true backbone and authority behind Clear Wind City had always been Xu Hun, the one who decisively made the call in critical situations.

Furthermore, there was the old sage Zhi Qiu, who wanted to visit the Snow Temple. Sui You had already died once, and both Wei Xian and Lu Baixiang had, in succession, gained military and official identities within the Dali Empire. In the Dali Dynasty, aside from military achievements, one could only ascend to higher ranks through even greater military achievements. Even the aristocratic descendants from Yucheng Lane and Chi'er Street, like Guan Yiran and Liu Xunmei, had emerged from the piles of corpses, while the descendants of the supervisory officer Cao Gengxin and the pillar of the nation Yuan Zhengding had first earned their degrees through the imperial examination before being tossed into the local bureaucracy to navigate the treacherous waters. In such a chosen field, families might manage to gain some influence, but after that, whether one could rise through the ranks or ascend smoothly depended entirely on the Dali system of merit.

Before descending the mountain, Cui Dongshan had guided Cao Qinglang in his cultivation. Cao Qinglang's breakthrough was neither fast nor slow—considered slow compared to the average direct disciples of sect leaders, yet not fast when compared to talents like Lin Shouyi.

This was perfectly acceptable; when cultivating on the mountain, as long as one's aptitude was sufficient, one didn't need to be overly impressive. Many geniuses fall early, so the steady approach was paramount. The ability to astonish after transitioning to swordsmanship stemmed from having previously studied with a solid foundation.

These days, even the seemingly simple and adorable Cen Jie found herself facing marriage proposals each time she returned home. Particularly her mother had privately spoken several times to her about personal matters, her eyes reddening with emotion. After all, it was their daughter, so charming and from a relatively well-off family, yet she had become a big girl without worries about marrying off. Proposals had become increasingly scarce, with many young scholars she had set her sights on becoming suitors for other families instead.

Cui Dongshan sat on a bench at the mountain gate, listening to Cao Qinglang recount his youthful experiences. Cui Dongshan couldn't help but feel a twinge of regret, as this journey had delayed him from witnessing many interesting events.

Cao Qinglang had diligently pursued his studies in the lotus flower blessed land, under the guidance of his mentor, Zhi Qiu, and later traveled far and wide with Zhi Qiu for years, acquiring substantial skills. His speech was articulate, and he carried himself with grace. The only regret in his heart was that his coming-of-age ceremony was held in the absence of his teacher.

Before leaving, Cui Dongshan was both happy and worried; he was pleased with how well Cao Qinglang had grown, yet troubled by the more challenging matters left unspoken.

The joyful part was that Cao Qinglang’s words were rarely tinged with the sense of despondency typical of Broken Fate Mountain. After all, such an atmosphere could not last forever. In the past, his teacher had felt somewhat uneasy about this, often insisting that the atmosphere of Broken Fate Mountain must remain as it was. He never dared claim all the credit for its achievements, as others like Cui Dongshan, Zhu Lian, and Zheng Dafeng also shared considerable merits. Now that his teacher had been away for many years, if the younger generation of Broken Fate Mountain started to resemble him more and more in their interactions and demeanor, it would be a source of embarrassment for Cui Dongshan, as he had truly jumped into a quagmire of reputation, becoming irreparably tainted.

“Junior brother, who do you think is more beautiful, Cen Yuanshi or the two ladies, Yuan Bao? Speak your mind; we’re not gossiping behind anyone’s back. I, as your senior brother, am not one to indulge in idle chatter. We’re just having a heart-to-heart exchange as fellow brothers. If you don’t speak, it’ll seem like you’re hiding something, and I’ll have to suspect you openly,” Cui Dongshan said with a grin.

“Cen Yuanshi has a more exquisite appearance, and when it comes to practicing punches, she is focused, regardless of others around her, which is quite rare. Yuan Bao, on the other hand, has a resilient temperament; once she sets her mind on something, she is incredibly persistent. Both are good ladies. However, senior brother, I must clarify—I’m merely sharing my thoughts, so please don’t overthink it. I feel Cen Yuanshi is perhaps overly diligent in her training but lacks a bit of agility. If she could harbor a grand ambition, her martial arts might improve further. After all, what does it matter if a female martial artist faces more disadvantages than a cultivator? Once she strikes out, she must make all the male masters bow in submission. On the other hand, Yuan Bao is clever and perceptive. If Mr. Lu would teach her with a bit more leniency and empathy, that would be even better. Senior brother, these are merely my humble opinions; take them with a grain of salt.”

“Is that all?” Cui Dongshan asked.

“Is there anything else?” 

“Does Yuan Bao have a crush on anyone? Do you know?” 

“How could I know something like that? Besides, it’s not good to make assumptions.”

Cui Dongshan chose not to press further.

Yuan Bao had feelings for Cao Qinglang, just as Yuan originally had feelings for Cen Yuanshi.

Cen, with her martial spirit and sharp edge, secretly admired a scholar she rarely saw, making it difficult for her to fully embrace her feelings. 

Yuan Bao’s seemingly rebellious behavior and her juvenile tactics were just a façade. Since she could not muster the courage to speak her feelings directly, she had to let her words reach him indirectly.

Cao Qinglang cherished the teachings of sages, preferring to be a scholar. He even secretly kept a few books on the imperial examination, yet he had affection for the martial artist Cen Yuanshi, loving her as if Broken Fate Mountain was graced with two moons—one in the sky and one in his heart.

Cui Dongshan considered himself too clever and too cold-hearted. He excelled at handling many "bad situations" and resolving unexpected troubles, so he dared not touch these beautiful matters, fearing that he might shatter them with too much force.

After all, human hearts are not like the moon reflected in water; the moon will always return, while human emotions can shift like clouds. 

It’s okay; he would leave it for his teacher.

Once his teacher returned home, it would be difficult for him to venture out again, and Broken Fate Mountain would enjoy hundreds, even thousands of years of prosperity. The lineage would continue to grow, the seats in the ancestral hall would multiply, and Broken Fate Mountain along with its allied peaks would be frequented by many. The disciples would continue to pass down their teachings, and the lineage's record would thicken, piling up into boxes. Even the one who cherished remembering every person and event—the teacher—would eventually find it hard to keep track, encountering young faces he wouldn’t recognize or know the names of.

In the past, Chen Lingjun, who was solely focused on "two punches," would become one of the revered guardians of Broken Fate Mountain in the hearts of future young cultivators. It was unimaginable that the founder Chen Lingjun would once linger at the foot of Cloud Mountain, only to be turned away and return to Broken Fate Mountain, nearly shedding tears in secret.

The river dragon Hongxia, which had once dared not approach Broken Fate Mountain, would become a lofty "Yellow Robed Fairy" in the eyes of future disciples of Broken Fate Mountain, firmly believing that their ancestor Hongxia was truly capable of mastering water magic.

It was even possible that the warm trees would have fewer chances to busy themselves with trivial matters, and even a handful of sunflower seeds from Little Rice's pocket would be regarded by the cultivators of Broken Fate Mountain as more valuable than the coins of the Rain Festival.

There would surely come a day when every disciple of Broken Fate Mountain would proudly speak of their founder's unparalleled martial arts and supreme swordsmanship, admiring their old master Chen's connections throughout the world, recounting which old ancestor was a close friend and which sect leader was their brother... As future generations traveled down the mountain or roamed the world, they would likely enjoy sharing tales of their ancestors' grand feats.

Thus, the rules and principles established by the young mountain lord of Broken Fate Mountain would only grow more numerous and significant.

And Cui Dongshan aimed to ensure that these future matters would be an indelible thread, a path stretching through the mountains and rivers. The pathways had already been laid out, and in the future, disciples of Broken Fate Mountain could confidently tread upon them, hoping that someone might carve out a new path even better. However, in this process, there would undoubtedly be various mistakes, human hearts drifting apart, and numerous small and large misfortunes. It would require someone to teach and guard the way, someone to correct and amend errors. It was never the case that a single teacher could handle everything alone.

Thus, the lesson Cui Zhan imparted to Cui Dongshan, convincing him not to act impulsively, had nothing to do with outsiders; it was simply a matter between Cui Zhan and Cui Dongshan.

If you believe you are Cui Dongshan, no longer Cui Zhan, that’s fine. Cui Zhan has already made the Dali Dynasty and the Baoping Continent into a significant "One," so you, Cui Dongshan, should make Broken Fate Mountain the next great "One" in the world.

Let us engage in a philosophical duel, and may Cui Zhan live a hundred more years while granting you at least a hundred to wrestle with me over whose "One" is greater and more unbreakable.

Whenever Cui Dongshan thought of this, he wanted to curse loudly, but each time he only managed to mutter “old bastard” without saying more.

What does that Mi Yu care about? Can he compare to me, Dongshan?! He dreams of me taking him to the Yuye River's Divine Palace to relieve his boredom—he can dream on! I’m just envious and resentful.

After all, there are differences in intimacy. Cui Dongshan considered himself quite protective of Mi Yu, as he would be the future pillar of their aspirations. However, he was less courteous to some newcomers whom he didn’t hold in high regard, treating them as half-family while withholding excessive politeness, fearing it would make him seem distant.

For instance, the trinket that the fox kingdom's ruler Pei Xiang had inscribed for Zhu Lian had already become a treasure in Cui Dongshan's hands. He cherished the phrase “True Heart for Years,” so he gifted Pei Xiang a trinket he no longer favored. This was not only a fair exchange of goodwill but also a small token of gratitude from Broken Fate Mountain. Receiving an item that even fifth-tier cultivators might not fully possess left the ruler of the fox kingdom feeling as if she were dreaming.

One day, while the old chef was cooking in the kitchen, Cui Dongshan leaned against the door and playfully took out that small inkstone, blowing gently on it to show off to Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian glanced over and asked with a smile, “How much is ‘True Heart for Years’ worth?” 

Cui Dongshan replied with a grin, “It's worth a lot, a lot indeed, requiring a trinket in exchange. Of course, it’s not just about money; with Pei Xiang's high position, she has to consider her kingdom. Don’t be too sad, old chef, or you might only end up troubling Pei Xiang even more.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, saying it was already quite unexpected, his demeanor calm and genuinely sincere. Cui Dongshan then asked, “What if Pei Xiang were to apologize to you?”

“I have my own methods to ease her heart; otherwise, what can be done?” Zhu Lian answered.

Cui Dongshan grew increasingly impressed by the old chef, realizing he was not just a mere cook—his wisdom could not simply be described as accomplished but rather as seasoned.

On the mountain gate side, Cui Dongshan casually inquired about some trivial matters regarding Mr. Lu from the time spent at the lotus flower blessed land, the more minute, the better. This way, it wouldn’t raise suspicions from the meticulous Cao Qinglang, and a few trivial conversations would be less likely to reveal true intentions. After all, the more frequent these casual chats, the more they could reflect genuine character. Moreover, Mr. Lu had been quite sincere with Cao Qinglang, allowing Cui Dongshan to draw closer to the “real Mr. Lu.”

Once Zou Zi felt the timing was right and truly took action, he would have various young sword cultivators of the realm at his disposal, like Liu Cai, one among the top ten young sword cultivators. With two sword nurturing gourds and two life swords that countered his nature, these would not only serve as methods to suppress Mr. Lu but also as a smokescreen. The teachings of the sword were not limited to the blade; Mr. Lu had long understood this, and in the future, he might even use Zhengyang Mountain as a training ground, asking about the heart of this person through the sword.

So, relying on one person to dominate the entire "Lushi family," Zou would certainly be aware.

At that time, Zou Zi would undoubtedly make the past sufferings of Lu Tai incredibly difficult, while also transforming Liu Cai into a sword immortal in Zou Zi's eyes. Ultimately, this would only intensify Mr. Lu’s struggles. All the sincere feelings and past grievances shared between them would become another life sword crafted by Zou Zi for Lu Tai—a sword that Liu Cai wielded with true ferocity. The most troubling aspect lay in Zou Zi’s intention to kill one with the other, which would not necessarily force Liu Cai to kill Mr. Lu, but rather point towards a path of enlightenment. The notion of life and death might appear to be merely a family matter, yet often it could concern the families next door. All it took was to separate the body and mind.

Cui Dongshan rarely felt such trepidation towards anyone.

A person who dared use Shi Rou as a path and compare themselves to Lu Chen, saying, “Lu Chen, you’re boring; I’m here to relieve boredom,” such a person would naturally be far more formidable than one who merely used red threads and manipulated the sword array of a continent to forge a path of enlightenment.

However, this significant matter should not be mentioned in front of junior brother Cao Qinglang, as he was ultimately still too young and lacked true experience.

Yet, even just chatting with Cao Qinglang lightened Cui Dongshan’s mood somewhat. Within the same lineage, there were successors—he could see a promising figure capable of great responsibilities, which was more worthy of his expectation than who had gained a higher martial rank or who might ascend to the next peak.

The younger brother, who seemed to make the little bamboo chair grow smaller each year, had transformed from a slightly thin young man in his hometown into a refined young scholar.

The lineage of the Literary Sage had a rich heritage, and aside from Jun Qian, even Mr. Lu himself had a commendable relationship with women.

When it came to Cao Qinglang, even Cui Dongshan hesitated to be certain. After all, having good relations with women required some awareness, didn’t it? Otherwise, one would be as dull as a wooden block, even if the matchmaker visited frequently, hammering red threads, or if they pulled the red thread taut to run toward their brothers, feeling quite pleased, thinking they understood everything. What could the teacher or the brothers do then?

Cui Dongshan's light chat with Cao Qinglang was, in fact, a temporary farewell to Broken Fate Mountain.

As a cloud drifted on the wind, he couldn’t help but glance back at the picturesque mountain and waters.

He was leaving, but he wanted to look back a few more times; he truly couldn’t resist the urge to return for more sunflower seeds.

With the old chef and the lawmaker on the mountain, he felt at ease. Outside the mountain, there was also Liu Xianyang, someone he could trust.

What truly reassured Cui Dongshan about Liu Xianyang was not his level as a Golden Core swordsman achieved through dreaming of sword practice, but rather the simple request, “Can I take a distant look at Liu Cai?”
After watching the scene unfold, what would Liu Xianyang do? Of course, he was destined to kill in his dreams! Liu Xianyang didn’t bother to question the cause and effect, nor did he care about the price he would have to pay. Even his refined scholar’s demeanor was momentarily set aside!

Some matters of life and death, especially those that dance around the threshold of the underworld, can teach a person what it means to be wise after just a single painful experience. Liu Xianyang had already done something similar for a friend back in his hometown. Yet, when faced with another issue concerning the same friend, he still displayed a shocking lack of wisdom.

Cui Dongshan was certain that his master, Chen Pingan, despite everything, still believed Liu Xianyang to be infinitely more intelligent than himself. It was a conviction he might hold onto for life.

This belief was precisely why Cui Dongshan had, at that time, borrowed a bit of courage from the left protector of Qilong Lane, risking a reprimand from his master to arrange for Liu Xianyang to follow the Confucian scholar Chen on that journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As a small, secretive “immortal,” Cui Dongshan could certainly accomplish many things, but he would never be able to carry himself as confidently as Liu Xianyang. Especially not in the way Liu Xianyang could act from the heart, as if to say, “If my actions don’t carry weight with Chen Pingan, then who am I? Who is Chen Pingan?”

Even Cui Dongshan had to admit that this unspoken confidence of Liu Xianyang’s was pretty impressive.

Such a Liu Xianyang was deserving of any good woman in the world.

Cui Dongshan did not head to the capital of the Great Li Dynasty or the ancient city of Longcheng, but instead journeyed to the vast mountain region not governed by Wei Bo. He still had some matters to attend to at Zhenwu Mountain, related to Old Yang, so he needed to proceed with caution.

Flipping through the old records, he realized that those ancient deities who once stood at the peak were now scattered across various mountains. If they had been united, humanity wouldn’t have been able to ascend the peaks. The most significant commonality among them remained the indifference of the heavenly law. The transformations experienced by Ruan Xiu and Li Liu in this lifetime were deliberately orchestrated by Old Yang. Otherwise, why did Li Liu, who had reincarnated multiple times, maintain her core Dao despite each rebirth?

Cui Dongshan yawned, and at the junction of the two mountains, he suddenly flipped, changing his position from face-up to face-down to glance at the mortal world.

The various night wanderers residing in the City God Temple of the Northern Mountains were now probably the most “grateful” beings to their Lord Wei.

On Cloudy Mountain, the currently unoccupied Wei Bo sat quietly in a small bamboo grove. 

These few remaining bamboo stalks didn’t just come from Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven; more accurately, they were from Qing Shen Mountain, where the mountain god’s shrine was located—a rare find indeed. Back when he had caused trouble for A Liang, he had reluctantly accepted it. In truth, every time he visited the Bamboo Pavilion at Ruined Mountain, Wei Bo felt a mix of emotions. A longer gaze would tug at his heartstrings; if he looked away, he couldn’t help but feel the ache.

Now, the bamboo grove appeared desolate and barren. Wei Bo sighed. The Night Wandering Banquet could be forced through, but the bamboo must be carefully protected.

Previously, when he had found Cui Dongshan and inquired whether the white-clad youth had any connection to the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven, wondering if he could purchase a few comparable ancestral bamboo to keep nearby, he had been willing to pay a high price, even to the point of selling his possessions. Cui Dongshan had worn a strange expression, saying he was willing to risk his life to speak on behalf of the mountain lord, yet feared being beaten half to death by the lady of Qing Shen Mountain and dragging Cloudy Mountain into the list of “first-class honored guests” of the Qing Shen Shrine.

Wei Bo had no choice but to give up.

However, he placed his hopes on Chen Pingan, as he was skilled at dealing with either women or seniors. This young mountain lord of Ruined Mountain had a knack for it.

The small incense spirit in the City God Temple, who regularly reported to Ruined Mountain, was secretly rewarded with a temporary minor official title by Zhou Mi Li, the right protector of Qilong Lane, the one who had just stepped down. Zhou Mi Li had candidly told him that whether the endeavor succeeded ultimately depended on Pei Qian’s disposition; for now, he was merely acting in an interim capacity. The little guy was so delighted that he nearly went home beating drums in celebration.

When the incense spirit returned to the City God Pavilion, he probably donned an official hat with his back straightened, feeling a surge of confidence. Standing at the incense burner’s edge, hands on hips, he looked up at the golden statue and declared, “Make sure to show me some respect from now on!” “If you don’t hurry up and throw in more incense ash, I’ll sue you to Ruined Mountain! I’ve got someone backing me up now; if you don’t welcome me, I’ve got other places to go!”…

The City God, the most revered within Longzhou, chuckled, replying, “What an impressive display of authority!”

The little guy’s bravado slightly diminished, and emulating the right protector, he crossed his arms. Just as he was about to utter some heroic words, the City God slapped him out of the pavilion. Embarrassed, he simply ran away, seeking refuge at Ruined Mountain for the day. Encountering the right protector of Ruined Mountain, he lamented his small stature, wishing he could carry the burden for Lord Zhou. When Chen Nuan Shu learned of the little guy’s complaints about the City God, he offered some advice, suggesting that since he and the City God had shared hardships at Mantou Mountain for years, now that his master had finally ascended to a high position, he too had become part of the City God Pavilion’s face and shouldn’t frequently sulk at the City God, lest he become a laughingstock among the other city gods and shrines. In the end, Nuan Shu smiled, asserting that the right protector of Qilong Lane certainly knew how to behave and was always thorough and polite.

Little Mi Li nodded vigorously, gently resting her hand on the incense spirit’s head, saying, “Those of us who have been or are currently the right protector of Qilong Lane are all quite clever!”

The incense spirit was initially taken aback, then pondered for a moment, ultimately feeling delighted. With a little help in exiting this awkward situation, he leapt off the stone table, cheerfully heading home down the mountain.

That night, Liu Xianyang walked alone along the banks of the Longxu River, making his way to the Iron Talisman River. Across the river stood the Water God Shrine, dedicated to Yang Hua, the god of the river. It was only at this point that Liu Xianyang turned back.

Before leaving Nan Posuo Island, the old master had bid farewell to him on the cliff. He shared a matter with Liu Xianyang and allowed him to choose for himself.

At that moment, Liu Xianyang raised his wrist and couldn’t help but smile wryly. Without hesitation, he performed a bow, earnestly requesting the old master to sever the red thread of fate.

Chen Pingan smiled and snapped the red thread with two fingers, reminding Liu Xianyang, “Be careful when you return to your hometown. Those who can meddle in this are certainly not simple.”

Liu Xianyang sighed, vigorously rubbing his cheeks. The odd existence of that sword cultivator Liu Cai indeed caused worry. Yet, thinking of that girl, the Month of Promise, made him feel a little better. He dashed to the water’s edge to “check his reflection,” muttering to himself that even several of Chen Pingan couldn’t compare to his own good looks. Ah, that Month of Promise was truly fortunate!

In the Northern Julu Prefecture, the head of Yufou Academy, Zhou Mi, awaited two replies. Temporarily unable to retreat to Baoping Island to relax, he decided to take a short trip to Lion Peak instead, enjoying drinks with two friends: the Peak Master and the martial artist Li Er.

Not long ago, Zhou Mi had visited Lion Peak, where he encountered a young Confucian scholar who claimed to be from Cliff Academy. The young man had been reading on the mountain, clearly someone who wouldn’t neglect himself. With a bowl and chopsticks, a pot of wine, and a few side dishes, the young man named Li Huai had treated Zhou Mi like a fellow cultivator of Lion Peak, boldly inviting him to drink and offering the remaining half pot of wine to the “Divine Immortal Zhou” to take home, insisting that it was all on the house. He had mentioned having a sister cultivating on the mountain and asked Zhou Mi to look out for her.

Zhou Mi chuckled and asked, “Has your son returned to Baoping Island?”

Li Er nodded, grinning, “Yes, he has. He can’t always be wandering around. After all, my son is a scholar.”

Li Er and his wife still believed that their most valuable asset was their son Li Huai’s identity as a scholar. As for their daughter, Li Liu, she had always been a good and sensible girl, and she still was.

The Peak Master’s smile turned awkward, not because Li Huai was inconsiderate, but rather because he was overly so. For the sake of his sister’s celestial prospects, he had said all sorts of flattering things, which was out of place at Lion Peak. Furthermore, the old Yuan Ying had grown accustomed to flattery at the dining table outside the mountain. So, the old cultivator didn’t mind the praises; he just found himself at a loss for words, fearing that he might offend.

The founder of Lion Peak was no mere Golden Core Earth Immortal in Li Huai’s eyes; she had a flying, ascended demon as her servant and treated it as a casual assistant.

After sharing drinks with Li Er and the others, Zhou Mi found himself alone at a scenic pavilion, gently sighing.

“Master, some things in the world can be done or left undone. Let’s do them first, and if you think the journey is too far, I’ll take care of the ceremonial sealing. But don’t forget to send me that decree made of blue material from the Confucius Temple.”

Due to sharing the same name as a great demon, this self-proclaimed amiable Confucian sage communicated with the Confucius Temple in a formal manner. However, his letters to his master were nearly disrespectful.

“If you can’t even do this, I’ll have to return the sage teachings you imparted to me. Not only that, but I’ll also resign from my position as the headmaster. The Confucian scholar Zhou Mi will seek out that Wild World’s Zhou Mi; after all, only one of us can remain.”

At the Thunder God’s Residence on Infant Mountain, the two foreign gentlemen finally left. 

The fellow named Chen Lingjun refused to bow his head and admit his mistakes until the very end, maintaining an attitude of “You admit your faults first, then I’ll apologize.” The reason the Thunder God’s Residence released him was that Prince Longting, Li Yuan, had sent a second secret letter with just one sentence: “Don’t play nice; my good brother has eaten too many meals at your place. If you keep him locked up, I’ll turn your Thunder God’s Residence into a water prison!”

However, at that moment, Chen Lingjun remained blissfully unaware, merely wishing and praying for the lord’s blessings of safety, believing his wishes had finally come true.

His once-glorious name was now tarnished at the Thunder God’s Residence.

At least he no longer had to live in constant fear of the prison; otherwise, just a hint of meat in his meal could feel like a death sentence, and seeing his friend wolfing down his food would only bring him sorrow, feeling he had dragged his good brother down with him.

Now, however, the sky was wide, and the gang of old deities at the Thunder God’s Residence not only didn’t hold a grudge over the loss of the “God Residence” title but happily escorted him down the mountain.

Chen Lingjun secretly left all the divine money in prison, only keeping enough gold leaves and silver ingots to ensure he and his good buddy wouldn’t go hungry. The Thunder God’s Residence might not be particular, but he, Chen Lingjun, was.

After descending the mountain, Chen Lingjun inevitably felt a bit downcast.

The young coachman said, “The deities at the Thunder God’s Residence didn’t admit their mistakes, and we didn’t either, so it’s even now.”

Chen Lingjun looked back at Infant Mountain from a distance, “Aren’t we all deities? Is it really that difficult to admit a mistake and correct it?”

The young coachman laughed, “Whose face is more important, a deity’s or a commoner’s? Brother, you really are naive; can’t you see this?”

Chen Lingjun chuckled and replied, “Forget about face.”

The young coachman continued, “Let’s go drink good wine; who cares? Remember to pick the expensive stuff, though. Being stingy isn’t our style.”

In a coastal city, Chen Lingjun found a tavern and ordered a large spread of food and drink. Together with his steadfast brother, they drank and got thoroughly drunk. The brothers needed to drown their sorrows in wine.

The young man, named Bai Mang, had a peculiar name. Once, when Chen Lingjun was drunk at the tavern, he remarked that the name wasn’t very auspicious. He promised his friend that when they returned to their hometown, he would ask his father to give him a better name. Chen Lingjun stood on the bench, giving a thumbs-up, saying, “My father’s naming skills are top-notch!”

Although he was a young coachman, he was a solid martial artist at the third realm, and quite seasoned in the ways of the world.

When Chen Lingjun made friends, he didn’t pay too much attention to their levels. Besides, in his hometown, realms were nothing to take seriously; they held no weight.

In this vast world, affinity mattered most.

That day, at the tavern with his good buddy Bai Mang, they ordered an array of signature dishes. Bai Mang said something profound, “It’s rare to have a day like today without worries; perfect for enjoying fine wine.”

What was fine wine? Expensive wine. Chen Lingjun loved it, and Bai Mang’s straightforwardness was his favorite; he never put on airs. Bai Mang exuded a genuine brotherly affection that made Chen Lingjun deeply appreciative. Damn it, Li Yuan’s brother was just missing this bold spirit.

Today, Chen Lingjun got quite drunk, but instead of bragging with Bai Mang, he felt a bit sentimental, lowering his voice as he reflected, “In the past, I loved hearing compliments, couldn’t stand a single unflattering remark. Then I met the lord, who told me to listen to both good and bad comments and not take them too seriously. After all, ten compliments can be crushed by one criticism. So, whenever I hear a compliment, I reserve ninety percent of it, waiting for that single criticism to arrive; that way, I won’t feel hurt at all.”

The young coachman shook his head, “Brother Lingjun, very few in this world are as calculating and wise as you. Most people only want to hear good things. Otherwise, they must be idle and gluttonous, eager to pick out the ugly.”

Chen Lingjun chuckled, “Are you talking about me?”

The young coachman laughed, “I’m talking about myself too. Let’s encourage each other. At least we understand the reasoning; whether we can act on it, we’ll talk about it after the drinks.”

Chen Lingjun quickly raised his cup to drink with Bai Mang.

He couldn’t help but sigh again, feeling strange today. He suddenly thought of that old brother from Huanghu Mountain and said, “Bai Mang, when you come to my house next time, I want to introduce you to a friend, an old Daoist named Jia. He’s witty and can hold his liquor well; we get along great back home.”

Bai Mang laughed, “Jia? Is that for real? Sounds fake.”

Chen Lingjun chuckled, “Not very educated, huh? But as a man of the world, it’s fine not to recognize big characters. You just need to throw in a name.”

Bai Mang hurriedly drank a bowl of wine, filling another cup. The bowl wasn’t large, so they needed to drink in multiples. After all, good brothers weren’t stingy. In the world of Jianghu, that’s what brotherhood meant!

The two staggered out of the tavern, and Chen Lingjun weighed his purse, grimacing, “Bai Mang, it seems we can’t afford many more meals like this.”

Bai Mang nodded with a smile, “Yeah, every banquet must come to an end.”

Chen Lingjun burped; he was still in his bamboo box and holding a walking stick. He intended to follow his friend’s words and scold Bai Mang for not speaking properly, but just thinking about truly embarking on the journey made those words sound sad, and he couldn’t bring himself to argue. After all, venturing out was bound to be difficult and fraught with unexpected events. Bai Mang was only a third-realm martial artist; he might not be able to keep up with Chen Lingjun’s pace, and who knew what would happen if they were stopped by the Thunder God’s Residence.

Bai Mang turned to look at the silent Chen Lingjun and chuckled, giving him a hearty slap on the back of his head, causing the latter to stumble slightly.
Chen Lingjun scratched his head in confusion. "What is it?"

Bai Mang patted his belly and laughed, "A good drink can fill you up, just play it by ear."

After hesitating for a moment, Chen Lingjun said, "Brother, it seems we really have to part ways. I have something important to do, and I can't delay it. If I succeed, I'll come back to find you, and we’ll have a good drink—maybe even the finest immortal brew!"

Seeing Bai Mang just smiling and gazing at him, Chen Lingjun was taken aback. "What’s the matter? Have you been cooped up for too long that you think I’m some delicate flower? Bai Mang, don’t be like that! How about I give you all the golden leaves, and I’ll keep the silver ingots? After that, where you go is none of my business."

Bai Mang laughed heartily, "No need for that! As long as I’m with a good brother, I won’t have to worry about food and drinks. That’s the way of the world…"

Chen Lingjun had already taken off his book box, walking to a secluded spot where he opened the bamboo chest and pulled out the last remaining bundle of golden leaves, handing them to Bai Mang. Noticing that his good brother hadn’t moved, Chen Lingjun complained about his lack of decisiveness, saying he wasn’t acting like a true brother.

Bai Mang hesitated for a moment.

Chen Lingjun casually tossed the bundle to him. After Bai Mang caught it, Chen Lingjun hugged his walking staff and clasped his fists, saying, "Bai Mang, we part ways here. If you’re willing, wait for me at the Water Dragon Sect. As long as I can return, I’ll definitely come find you and take you to Treasure Bottle Continent for some fun. I’m not just boasting! I know that place like the back of my hand; wherever I go, drinks won’t cost a dime! Once we get there, we’ll feast like kings..."

Bai Mang smiled, "Then I’ll wait for you at Spring Dew Garden."

Chen Lingjun thought for a moment—who was waiting for whom was still uncertain—but he found it inconvenient to say more, so he agreed to meet at Spring Dew Garden.

With that, Chen Lingjun strode away.

Bai Mang tucked the bag of golden leaves into his sleeve, leaning against the alley wall, watching as Chen Lingjun’s figure gradually faded into the distance.

Indeed, who was waiting for whom remained to be seen.

Bai Mang had originally planned to wait until things settled down.

Just like that old Daoist, Jia Sheng, he’d return this body to its original owner.

However, unlike Jia Sheng, who had been muddled, his mind was now clearer. Occasionally, he would glance at the memories of the past, at the Pearl Cave.

As for the body he inhabited now, he was merely a passerby. When the day came for him to leave, the host would hardly remember a guest had come. Uninvited guests who barged in would naturally need to offer a gift upon departure. What with distant travels and physical enhancements, and celestial cultivation, it was not difficult. Yet for mere mortals suddenly blessed with wealth, their shallow hearts may not lead to any long-term benefit. Handing over some worldly gold and silver in exchange for a body that could extend life by a few years might suffice for a wanderer. They would return to their hometown, gaining a strange yet comfortable prosperity—close enough.

Admiring flowers while overlooking the mist is indeed a difficult endeavor.

Must one truly end up smiling at a flower in the end?

Bai Mang suddenly chuckled, raising his hand to form a seal.

The sword technique was also a way of enlightenment.

With a flick of his sword, the principles of the Dao were set in motion.

Time flowed backward like a river in reverse.

Bai Mang had just received that bag of golden leaves when Chen Lingjun had just turned around.

Bai Mang smiled, "Chen Lingjun, I really came here to slay the dragon. At the Pearl Cave ruins, it would be a two-fold gain. I’ll first deal with that true dragon’s remnant and then, after a short distance, I’ll slice off your head at the entrance of Jidu as a little token of gratitude for Lu Chen’s meddling."

Hearing "Chen Lingjun," the man turned around and gave Bai Mang a thumbs up, saying, "As expected of a good brother, you speak with such flair!"

Without drinks, I’m the most miserable one on the Ruined Mountain. But with drinks, not to mention the Ruined Mountain, the entire Northern Yue region is mine to command!

Then, Chen Lingjun leaped up and slapped the young man on the head, laughing and scolding, "Not eating seeds, huh? Look at how drunk you are! A good brother’s head isn’t meant for slaughter! If you’re out there, you can’t even afford a sword. If I let you carry one, you’d be off slaying the heavens!"

Bai Mang laughed heartily, forming another seal in his sleeve.

He remained where he was, while Chen Lingjun had already vanished around a street corner.

A head suddenly popped out, shouting, "Bai Mang, from now on, I’ll help you change your name! Bai Mang is just too lackluster!"

Bai Mang, or perhaps Jia Sheng, or the preaching mentor of the Lord of White Emperor City—once a slayer of dragons in the vast world—smiled and waved goodbye to Chen Lingjun.

---

At the high towers of the estate,

Today, Song Mu had left the crowded council hall filled with military generals and immortal masters, personally guiding the esteemed guest, Mr. Fan, to a high point for a view of the battlefield.

His uncle, Song Changjing, had spoken a few words that truly transformed him from the commoner, Song Jixin, of Mud Bottle Alley, into the Prince of the Great Li, Song Mu.

You can spend a lifetime diligently studying, yet you might not become a sage of the Confucian Temple. You can climb mountains to cultivate the Dao, but that doesn’t guarantee you’ll become an immortal. However, as the Prince of the Great Li, you don’t need to care whether you’re listed as Song He or Song Mu in the Song family genealogy. As long as you can recognize and employ talent, you’ll wield more power than any academy head or mountain immortal. 

The mountains and rivers of an entire continent are in your hands, waiting for you to strategize. The sages of the academy speak their theories for others to hear. What about those divine beings watching the mountains and rivers? That’s just for their own eyes. As for the thoughts of the women around you, do you really need to understand them? Should you wallow in self-pity? No, you need to let them guess what’s in your heart.

Song Mu exhaled gently.

Outside the Old Dragon City, a small Treasure Bottle Continent saw many mountain cultivators displaying their magical arts. Even Mr. Fan—the old cultivator who had once hunted down A-Liang—couldn’t help but feel a chill of fear.

Zhi Gui revealed his true dragon form in the sea, not only slaughtering the wild demon army but also summoning a massive tidal wave to crash against the water law technique wielded by the mighty demoness, Fi Fei.

When Fi Fei struck, the entire southern waters outside Old Dragon City seemed to split into two—a high and low division. After Zhi Gui revealed his true form, a pearl as large as the moon illuminated the area, instantly raising the sea surface near Old Dragon City. The two towering water walls, one high and one low, were the result of Fi Fei’s immense effort, aided by countless adept water demons pushing the tide.

Zhi Gui surged through the collapsing sea, heading straight for Old Dragon City!

On the battlefield of Old Dragon City, the cultivators from Treasure Bottle Continent wouldn’t allow the tidal waves to crash against the city’s defenses. In the sky hovered sword boats, and thousands of flying swords shot out. The sword immortals from Northern Ju Lu Continent, along with local sword cultivators from Treasure Bottle Continent, unleashed their brilliant sword lights, slicing through the water.

Some monks, representing the temples of Treasure Bottle Continent, risked their life’s essence and robes, using their staffs to transform into dragons, creating a blue mountain that spanned between the waves and the land, while covering half of Old Dragon City with their robes. They were determined to prevent the overwhelming tide from causing irreparable damage to the city’s formation.

The Grand Master Huang Tong of Taihui Sword Sect, instead of retreating, stood his ground on the shore, summoning his life-bound flying sword. Ignoring the gigantic waves, he took the opportunity to slay any water demons that fell into the sea. All pretenses were torn apart, and this was a chance to let the demoness see his true power—his sword shot out, transforming into eighty-one streams of light that danced around like dragons. Each brilliant sword light, upon touching a demon’s body, would explode into a myriad of sword lights, bursting forth with a thunderous crash.

Years ago, when he vied for death at the Sword Qi Great Wall with the sect master, this was the confidence Huang Tong had when he said, "Let me handle it; you go back."

Yet, unfortunately, he was still suppressed by the sect master Han Huaizi with a simple, "I am the sect master."

For now, the protective formation of Old Dragon City remained intact.

Before Mr. Fan departed, he smiled and said some "polite words" to Prince Song Mu. "It’s better that I can’t see this level of damage; if I do see it and don’t lend a hand, I’ll just have to pay."

Thus, Old Dragon City received a hefty sum of money to maintain the spiritual energy operation of the city and the floating sword boats above.

After Mr. Fan and his retinue left, Song Mu stared into the distance, watching the occasional glimpses of the true forms of two ancient rivals across the sea.

Zhi Gui, Fi Fei.

Both had revealed their true forms.

The dense water currents from the north swirled like a raging river, continuously flowing from the central great lake towards Zhi Gui.

Fi Fei had similarly tapped into a portion of the water currents from Northern Tongye Continent, but her momentum was not as spectacular as Zhi Gui's.

The battle of dragon and serpent.

Only, the true dragon, of a higher rank, was still young and at a lower realm.

Fortunately, for now, both sides were too cautious to recklessly seize the ocean currents, leaning instead towards the pure white true dragon with golden eyes.

Song Mu’s expression was calm, but one hand gripped the railing, his fingers curling like claws.

Suddenly, he withdrew that hand without turning around, simply raising it lightly.

The Great Li cultivators immediately allowed the two to approach the prince.

They were two old acquaintances, the young city lord Fu Nanhua and the immortal from Yinxia Mountain, Cai Jinjian.

With Fu Nanhua, there was no need for pleasantries. They hadn’t seen each other in a while, but over the years, one had lived in the inner city of Old Dragon City, and the other had moved to the outer city, providing plenty of opportunities to catch up. Thus, when Song Mu turned around, he merely smiled and nodded at Fu Nanhua, then turned to the immortal from Yinxia Mountain, clasping his fists and saying, "Congratulations, Jinjian, on reaching the Nascent Soul."

Cai Jinjian felt a bit awkward and replied, "It’s just a joke; Fu Nanhua just teased me about it, and you don’t need to join in."

After a hearty laugh, Song Mu said, "I’m not Fu Nanhua."

Cai Jinjian sighed, standing next to Song Mu, gazing at the battlefield. Above them, the protective formation of Old Dragon City shimmered, momentarily pressed down by the remaining waves, but after the impact, it dimmed slightly before quickly returning to its original spiritual glow. The Great Li Song family was indeed wealthy.

After Cai Jinjian obtained the opportunity at the Ascension Platform, thanks to Yinxia Mountain, she didn’t need to engage in battle at the front lines. Resources could be exchanged for merits.

Yinxia Mountain had even sent for Cai Jinjian after learning of her ascension, urging her to ensure that while she fought outside, she must protect the foundation of the Dao.

Song Mu continued to observe the distant battlefield.

His own cultivation was insignificant, which turned out to be a blessing, as he didn’t need to witness the bloody scenes too vividly.

The only true dragon in the world, stretching three thousand zhang, with its massive form, when torn open, would bleed even more and be more heartbreaking to witness.

Cai Jinjian glanced at the prince, who was no longer the young man who once walked Mud Bottle Alley, trying to hide his noble bearing.

In the central region of Treasure Bottle Continent, resembling the White Jade Capital, twelve flying swords were summoned for the first time, vanishing above the capital and the great lake, only to reappear outside Old Dragon City in the sea.

The flying swords pierced through the true form of Fi Fei from head to tail.

This allowed the white-boned true dragon, bared to the elements and covered in golden blood, to retreat from the battlefield. Yet even with the help of those twelve flying swords, the true dragon was still unable to escape smoothly.

A long-armed elder hovering outside the battlefield, wielding a sword, shifted from shouldering a long staff to smashing down on the true dragon’s head, causing its skull to crash into the depths of the sea, blood instantly staining the surface.

This scene was a mere stone’s throw from Old Dragon City.

Song Mu clenched his fists in his sleeves, maintaining an expressionless face.

Several sword immortals from Northern Ju Lu Continent helped suppress the true dragon, while the great demon Yuan Shou, seeing the opportunity to kill slipping away, smiled and took off, leaving the sword beneath him, suddenly transforming into a massive form. He crushed dozens of cultivators who dared to attack his favored son on the shore before striking the mountain water formation of Old Dragon City with a single blow, shattering the array formed from countless streams of spiritual energy, causing it to explode in a dazzling display, as if a magnificent rain fell upon Old Dragon City.

The long staff not only broke the formation but also continued its momentum, rapidly smashing toward the high towers of the estate.

Huang Tong and Li Cai almost simultaneously summoned their swords to strike at Yuan Shou’s head, but the great demon swatted away one sword and caught another, tossing it far.

Fortunately, just as the staff was about to hit the estate, a subtle, thin line appeared in the sky. It was a small mountain, brought in by someone unknown, blocking the remaining force of Yuan Shou’s blow.

When the "thin line" snapped, a mountain in the central region of Treasure Bottle Continent crumbled.

Yuan Shou dared not linger on the battlefield, having been struck by several swords from the sword immortals, and retreated back onto his long sword, exiting the battlefield.

Those sword-playing brats from Northern Ju Lu Continent were truly detestable. Once I smash a hundred ancestral halls in Treasure Bottle Continent, when I arrive at your homeland, I’ll make sure to smash your ancestral halls properly, rather than just turning it into a brawl.

On the Long Ascending Platform, a woman in white, having retracted her true form, curled up.

A young boy in yellow stood trembling at the steps, not daring to approach the gruesome master.

Zhi Gui pressed her face to the ground, glaring at the useless boy, squeezing out three words from between her teeth, "Stay far away."

That yellow-clad boy, who had previously followed Zhi Gui into the water successfully, a remnant of the past in Mud Bottle Alley, hurriedly ran down the steps, crouching at the base of the Long Ascending Platform, hands over his head, shivering.

Just moments ago, he had perceived that his master was on the verge of resorting to a healing meal.

Fi Fei had also returned to her human form, but with twelve holes in her body. Those weren’t the common swords of sword immortals, and they inevitably harmed her fundamental Dao, especially the one that penetrated her brow from the back of her head. It was the most vicious. However, compared to the dismal fate of the little dragon, Fi Fei was faring much better.

As for the twelve flying swords from White Jade Capital, not all returned to Cui Chen. One was shattered, while another was kept back as a gift for her young master.

The battlefield returned to a melee.

With a single command from Prince Song Mu, dozens of loyal Great Li warriors moved quietly, casting nets toward the three doors that had been breached by the wild demon armies.

These doors were both torn open by the demon army and intentionally opened by Old Dragon City.

Otherwise, the wild demon world would truly swarm Old Dragon City, moving northward.

Song Mu and all those eligible to participate in the discussions never truly believed that Old Dragon City could hold its ground.

Yet when Old Dragon City could no longer withstand the onslaught, it would be nothing but a desolate ruin, with enough demon forces dead—especially the demon cultivators. As for the cultivators of Treasure Bottle Continent? In any battle, can one truly avoid death?!

Just like those warriors heading to the battlefield. Aside from the Great Li border troops, many were prisoners from the Ministry of Justice’s dungeons. Each one was a "talisman," and every death among them would carry the power equivalent to a self-destructing Golden Core earth immortal.

Cai Jinjian asked, "Aren’t you worried that some of the warriors will be afraid and flee or surrender to the demons?"

Song Mu replied, "There will certainly be some, and probably quite a few. But it’s not something to worry about. They fear death, and the demons won’t dare to take them."

The loyal warriors from the Great Li military would surrender first and then die. It wouldn’t just be one person but rather a total of twelve, forcing the demon army’s camp not to accept their surrender. Moreover, given the chaos on the battlefield, who would have the leisure to sift through identities?

Soon, the frontlines near the encroaching demon army lit up with a brilliant glow.

Fu Nanhua leaned on the railing, glancing at Song Mu, who was squinting as he focused on the battlefield’s developments. Song Mu raised a hand, seemingly with an idea, calling over a secretary with a mental message, sending him off on the wind toward the council hall.
Fu Nanhua withdrew his gaze, a hint of envy flickering in his eyes. The identity of a feudal prince and the talent of a formidable leader—such things were enviable. Behind the Old Dragon City, the two elite cavalry units of the Great Li Dynasty had quietly awaited the city's imminent fall. Meanwhile, in the southeast and southwest of the Baoping Continent, fierce battles were already raging on two fronts. However, for the moment, those conflicts were not as devastating as the one at Old Dragon City. Yet, even this "not as devastating" was relative to the cultivators on the mountains; the death toll of the border troops and vassal soldiers of the Great Li Dynasty was rising sharply each day.

Of course, it was the elite cavalry stationed on the frontlines who suffered the most casualties. Yet, some vassal border troops deemed capable by the Great Li Dynasty fought alongside them on the frontlines. Even so, these elite soldiers from the vassal states were often looked down upon by the Great Li cavalry.

On a battlefield governed by the Jiang clan of Yunlin, a major conflict had just concluded. Under the setting sun, the civil and military secretaries of the Great Li Dynasty were busy arranging for the soldiers to clean up the battlefield. Most of the soldiers were vassal troops, with only a few hailing from the elite cavalry of the Great Li. After several battles, relationships among the troops had become somewhat more amicable. This so-called "amicable" meant they could chat casually a bit more.

A young soldier from a vassal state softly said, "Captain, according to those celestial beings, it is said that when people die, most simply cease to exist. Some may turn into wandering souls that can catch up during the first seven days. Only a small number have the chance to become ghosts."

The one called Captain had an elegant demeanor. If it weren't for his injuries, he could easily be mistaken for a cultured gentleman in a vassal state. However, this Captain, of course, was a remnant of a former official position in the vassal armies. Nowadays, he could barely call himself a captain; he had recently been promoted to a deputy officer due to his military achievements and was now just one of three deputy officers. Tomorrow, he would probably return to being just another deputy once the dust settled.

He chuckled softly, "The homeland is still here. The sooner you die, the sooner you can go home. Otherwise, if you die late, you might find your home gone. At that point, you wouldn’t even know where to go. Originally, you might be lucky enough to take a few more looks, but instead, it turns out to be bad luck."

In reality, this Captain, named Cheng Qing, was indeed a graduate in the truest sense.

Cheng Qing turned to the deputy officer beside him, jesting, "You Great Li are stationed at the very north; it should be easier to traverse."

The deputy officer, Wang Ji, was also around Cheng Qing's age and came from a scouting background in the Great Li border troops. However, when Cheng Qing joined the army, he was still a youth buried in his studies.

Cheng Qing had once asked an age-old question he had longed to know the answer to: why were the Great Li cavalry so formidable?

The man who had served as a deputy officer for many years in the Great Li border troops, despite appearing older than he was, pondered for a long moment before he gave an answer that wasn’t really an answer. He said, "When I first joined the border troops and faced the enemy for the first time, I didn’t dare to cry out when I saw my own comrades’ bones. I was carried by the old squad leader to dress my wounds. He wouldn’t blame me; I only blamed myself, thinking I wasn’t a good soldier, but I had to pretend to be brave. As for later, I simply got used to it."

A youthful-looking local border soldier of the Great Li shouted angrily, "What do you mean ‘you Great Li’? Clarify that!"

Wang Ji did indeed have an older appearance, while the youth genuinely looked like a boy of merely sixteen. Yet he was a true border cavalryman of the Great Li.

The youth grumbled inwardly, having tolerated the pretentiousness earlier. It was said that this guy was a scholar who had read a few books. Upon seeing the sunset, he claimed it resembled a beloved woman blushing, and even said the moonlight was a snob; otherwise, why did the moonlight look better on fine silk than on coarse cloth?

Spouting such nonsense that only half made sense to others, he thought, "You boast such great knowledge, yet I haven’t seen you kill more demon beasts than me. Why don’t you go be a Minister of Rites?"

Cheng Qing chuckled, "Alright, alright, you’re right, Horse Squad Leader."

The boy always claimed to be named Horse, so ever since he was born in the Great Li, he was destined to join the Great Li cavalry!

Seeing Cheng Qing take it lightly, the youth decided not to hold a grudge. After all, Cheng Qing was half a deputy officer now, and given that he was an outsider, it made sense why he was considered half.

Wang Ji didn’t stop the youth’s words. Instead, he reached out and gently pressed down on the boy's head, not allowing him to continue blabbering and risking the group's camaraderie. Wang Ji laughed, "It’s just some habitual sayings; it doesn’t matter. Besides, if we’re not even concerned with life and death, what else is there to fuss over? We’re all comrades now..."

Just then, the youth opened his mouth to speak but was gently pressed down by the deputy officer, causing him to promptly shut his mouth.

According to Great Li laws, all soldiers from the vassal states would have their ranks reduced by at least three levels. Those with no official rank had to obediently serve as common soldiers.

Cheng Qing teased, "Horse Squad Leader, did you see that Song Fairy who looks about your age? Did you notice if she cried while tending to your wounds?"

The boy’s face flushed red as he cursed, "You scholars are all such unseemly people! What kind of hero is it to laugh at a little girl? Come on, let’s spar!"

Cheng Qing waved his hand, "I dare not, I concede."

Everyone, whether from the Great Li or not, burst into laughter.

Now, in the rear of the battlefield, alchemists from the Medicine Family and disciples of the Dan Ding Sect were regarded as the highest-ranking celestial beings in the hearts of all Great Li soldiers. The reasoning was simple: one could save lives, and the other could increase the chances of survival.

Regardless of their cultivation level or appearance, women were genuinely called "fairies," while men had their surnames followed by "immortal." It was well-known that the Great Li border troops had always looked down upon the celestial beings of the Baoping Continent. Before this war, which had started without knowing when it would end, those practicing cultivation on the mountains dared to be arrogant. They would often boast, "See this Great Li sword? If I can’t kill you, my cavalry will just send someone else, and you’ll be dead before you dare fight back."

And the girl whom Cheng Qing referred to as "Song Fairy" was a Qi practitioner from the Medicine Family, brave enough to accompany her seniors to this place yet prone to secretly crying.

The youth, unwilling to let his companions mock his acquaintance with Song Fairy, immediately changed his tone and asked, "Deputy Officer, I heard you once followed our general to the Ministry of War in the capital. How was it? Was the office as imposing as they say? Is the Minister really as legendary as people claim, able to sneeze louder than thunder?"

The usually stern deputy officer smirked slightly, which was as close to a smile as he got. "Back then, I was just a personal guard to the general, which gave me the chance to tour the capital. Without an official document, I couldn’t enter the Ministry of War, and sneaking in would just be asking for trouble. So I waited outside for the general. With people coming and going at the office gate, I summoned the courage to touch the mane of a stone lion. Just as I was getting into it, the general came out and said the matter was settled. We were heading somewhere else, and a friend of the general's was working in a subordinate office under the Ministry of War. He was doing poorly but held the same official hat, sitting around drinking tea every day instead of fighting on the battlefield."

Wang Ji continued, "Actually, among the general’s friends, there are a couple who have really made a name for themselves in the capital. I’m familiar with them. I used to get beaten by them quite often. They all came from the same old unit as our general. But our general cares about his reputation and wouldn’t want to run into them."

"Whenever the general finished his business in the capital and wasn’t in a hurry to return to the border, he would visit the capital area. In the general's words, these old friends weren't as high-ranking as him."

Those old friends might not even have been that old, nor were they necessarily failing; many had simply died early.

Cheng Qing sighed inwardly.

The speaker was unaware, but the listener took the words to heart. This casual conversation made Cheng Qing, a scholar, find a deeper meaning.

Wang Ji, however, was oblivious to Cheng Qing's thoughts. He slowly continued, "I also followed him to the direct office of the Armory. As luck would have it, the general’s friend had business to attend to, so I had to sit with the general in the side hall, drinking a bellyful of tea all afternoon. There was hardly any tea, just a lot of water. The general was quite cheerful, saying that we military officials are truly poor—really poor—not like the Ministry of Rites, which just pretends to be poor with fancy talk. The general has a loud voice, and this happened to be overheard by the officials outside, who quickly sent a small jar of tea leaves, laughing as they told the general to sprinkle as much as he liked. It's not like before when the Ministry of Revenue was stingy, measuring tea by the two grams; now they’re generous enough to weigh it by the pound. Our general was just waiting for that line and immediately stood up, cupping his fists, saying, 'Thanks to my former comrade, Liu, who has been promoted to the Deputy Minister of Revenue.'"

"The old official laughed and said, 'Then we’re half family, right?' They started asking about each other's experiences in the border troops. It turned out that when Deputy Minister Liu was still a captain, our general was a scout officer. No one expected that when Deputy Minister Liu first joined the army, the old official had already been a squad leader. The general insisted the old man sit and drink tea while he took care of the door. The old man laughed, saying he couldn’t do that—one thing is one thing; being punished with wine on the border is delicious, but here in the office, the punishment isn’t so nice."

Hearing this, the youth asked, "Deputy Officer, didn’t you ask to be the door guard back then?"

Wang Ji was taken aback and shook his head, "At that time, I was too busy being happy to think of that."

The youth clicked his tongue, "Deputy Officer, you really aren't cut out for being an official. If it were me, I would have gone to the door to keep watch, at least letting the old squad leader and the general enjoy a pot of tea."

Wang Ji playfully pushed the youth's head, laughing, "The general says I can’t be an official, and I accept that. How can you, a mere squad leader, talk to a deputy officer like me?"

Wang Ji originally intended to drop the topic but found that everyone around seemed to enjoy such trivial stories. As the youth kept pressing for more about the capital, he continued, "I didn’t enter the Ministry of War, but I did take a trip with the general to Yichi Lane and Chier Street."

Those two streets in the capital were famous for their abundance of military households.

The youth’s eyes sparkled with anticipation, "So, how was it? Was the security tight? Walking down the street, did you dare to breathe too loudly? Did you have to report even a fart to the Ministry of War? Otherwise, you’d find your head rolling?"

At this point, the young soldier began laughing to himself, enjoying the joke, confident it was clever enough to share with his fellow soldiers later. Age didn’t matter; he was still the master of these troops!

Wang Ji shook his head, "At first, I was nervous, my palms sweating even more than on the battlefield. As I walked, it wasn’t much different than anywhere else. The trees along the sides were quite old; in the summertime, walking under their shade kept us cool."

Wang Ji, too embarrassed to mention that when he turned his head, he saw the general’s eyes shining with determination, showing no signs of fear, which helped him relax.

As for whether the general had to force himself to remain composed, he hadn’t thought much about it back then, but he planned to ask if he ever got the chance again.

The youth shot a sideways glance at Cheng Qing, laughing, "Yichi Lane, Chier Street—what a wonderful name! You can’t find names like that anywhere else!"

Cheng Qing nodded, "If you can come up with such good names, it’s only possible in Great Li."

That was a heartfelt statement.

The young soldier became furious, "Look at how capable you think you are! Want to fight me? I’m unarmed, but give me a knife so we can spar! Whoever loses is a grandson..."

Wang Ji again pressed down on the youth’s head, stopping him from making a fool of himself. He laughed and scolded, "He’s just giving you a compliment; be smart about it. Read more books in the future."

The young man leaned closer, whispering, "Can’t you tell the difference between good and bad words? It’s just that the Deputy Officer raised us, so I thought I’d find an excuse to get angry."

Wang Ji simply repeated, "Read more books in the future."

In Wang Ji’s eyes, this young soldier was still a child—he was only sixteen after all!

As long as a young man could survive the era of peace, he could read more books.

Let those of us who are older and hold a bit more rank go first.

Wang Ji didn’t tell the youth that the old man serving tea had a steady hand, but the other hand, which he intentionally hid, trembled. 

That hand had been injured on the battlefield.

As for the old man’s hand that didn’t shake, it was missing two and a half fingers.

The border scouts, the accompanying cultivators, and the veterans of the Great Li Dynasty were held in the highest regard.

The Great Li Dynasty valued these individuals highly.

They were often the first to die. Even those who became celestial beings didn’t spare their lives, nor did those who survived long on the battlefield.

Civil officials, the bearing of celestial beings, the charisma of scholars—though the Great Li Dynasty acknowledged them, when they encountered the former, they were told to step aside! 

When the Great Li cavalry and the various vassal armies first came together, conflicts arose frequently, both verbal and physical. Wang Ji had no shortage of opportunities to protect his men, striving for a semblance of justice. He only hoped that the words of the fierce soldiers of the Great Li wouldn’t be too excessive; that was enough—he didn’t dare to wish for more. Fortunately, the laws of the Great Li border troops were still enforced. 

The vassal troops could not stand against them; even the outspoken Great Li border troops dared not escalate matters. Often, when they defeated their opponents in training, they would be dragged back to the training grounds, receiving a thorough beating with military sticks. The Great Li border troops could see this, and so could the vassal soldiers.

According to some customs of the Great Li border troops, those who were severely punished would have their bare backs struck hard with the back of the blade, and in more severe instances, where the violations were grave, they would be dragged by horses, leaving their backs a bloody mess.

Strangely, when many gathered together to watch the commotion, the vassal soldiers often remained silent, while the Great Li border troops would jeer the loudest, whistling and making bizarre remarks, "Oh my, look at that white backside! Let’s satisfy our cravings tonight!" 

The Great Li border troops had a quirk: the older scouts or the old squad leaders from the veteran units, though not holding high ranks—some even very low—often carried themselves with great airs. Especially the former; even when they encountered a formally appointed Great Li general on the road, they would first salute, while the general might not return the gesture, depending on his mood.
In a vivid scene, a young military officer, who held the rank of a fifth-grade general, rode into a military camp to discuss matters of state. After leaving the command tent, he encountered an old sergeant on the road and immediately dismounted to greet him with cupped fists. Despite his youth, this man had a notable background, hailing from the prestigious family of the Chi’er Street. Now, he commanded five thousand elite troops of the Great Li Border Army, and he was still just a junior officer!

In the vassal state of Baopingzhou, his authority might even surpass that of a general in his own country.

The old sergeant, however, merely knocked on the young officer’s polished armor with his fist and playfully pinched his cheek, laughing as he scolded, “You little brat, not much of an achievement but with quite a title! No wonder you left our scouting unit—having a high-ranking official for a father has its perks, doesn’t it? You can go wherever you please! Damn it, if I could choose my next life, I’d want to be born as your son!”

With that, the old sergeant gave him a light shove. “Get lost. No more being a mere pawn who can only die on the battlefield. From now on, just focus on being an official—it’s still better on horseback.”

Wang Ji suddenly cast his gaze over everyone and remarked, “Everyone, we’ve had our share of grudges and victories, but regardless of the past, we’re all brothers in arms here on the battlefield, each wearing the Great Li battle standard. I may not have the words for flattery, but let me say this: our Great Li battle sword is the most beautiful bride in the world—everyone deserves one, so don’t think it’s too little!”

Vice Officer Cheng Qing, the young sergeant, and the others exchanged smiles. Some laughed out loud, while others merely chuckled quietly.

In the small territory of Baopingzhou, the sound of iron hooves echoed as cavalry from various nations marched together to hear the tides of the sea. The immortal beings on the mountains, unconcerned with worldly affairs, descended back to the plains, while heroes from the green woods and rivers plunged into the battlefield together...

Meanwhile, on the expansive land of Tongyezhou, one of the legendary sword immortals, a master from the Hundred Swords of the Moonlit Mountain, stood atop a remote, insignificant mountain. With one hand pressed against the hilt of his sword, he plunged it into the skull of a corpse. A sense of regret washed over him; it was far too easy to slay a Golden Elixir cultivator.

Behind this sword cultivator stood a dilapidated ancestral hall. A young cultivator from the same military camp raised a delicate hand, pale fingers adorned with blood-red nails. Inside the ancestral hall, five puppets twisted and turned, as if dancing under the command of this cultivator.

In the ruins of the vast capital city, a colossal demon loomed, its enormous body casting a shadow over half the city. Whenever it moved, it threatened to crush countless old legends.

Golden light broke through the heavens, crossing the great gates and descending upon the land of Tongyezhou.

When one of the ancient deities walked among mortals, trailing behind it was a shimmering spectrum of colors.

The Zhaozhou military tent announced to all the local demon clans of Tongyezhou that any of them who could find a nearby military tent would be officially recognized as different ranks of mountain and water deities based on their cultivation levels. Upon returning to their homeland, they would shatter the local Confucian temples, leaving only the martial temples behind, where the City God and the proper deities would independently build their shrines and gather offerings.

There were also talks that if they could cross the Great Sword Qi Wall, there was no reason they couldn’t get past the small Old Dragon City.

Zhou Mi stood at the northernmost ferry of Tongyezhou, gazing toward Cui Zhan, located in the central part of Baopingzhou, and smiled, “Though I’ve already disappointed the Embroidered Tiger, I can’t let him down too much.”

Cui Zhan turned to look into the distance, slightly shifting his gaze toward Fuyiao Island and Jinjiazhou.

Zhou Mi nodded. “We need to strategize further; there’s no time left.”

Over at Fuyiao Island, countless sword lights had previously surged toward all the remaining academies and learning halls.

In Jinjiazhou, which had already yielded most of its territory, the demon army continued its steady advance northward.

On a battlefield where the outcome had seemingly been decided, an ascended demon encountered Cao Ci and his group in a narrow path.

The demon commanded its army to disperse, brandishing a crimson gourd that unleashed the Samadhi True Fire. The ground for hundreds of miles around became scorched earth.

Yet, a figure in white continued to throw punches.

Among the chaos of battle, a young woman, seemingly oblivious to the danger, found herself in a playful skirmish with one of the rare ninth-grade peak warriors under the demon’s command.

This grand battle gathered the remaining elite forces of Jinjiazhou, alongside many fifth-grade cultivators and earthly immortals. They fought against the demon army for nearly a month, and the outcome remained uncertain until Jinjiazhou ultimately faced a tragic defeat due to the betrayal of a local ascended cultivator.

At the end of the great path, life was fleeting.

The old cultivator craved the old mountains and rivers of the human realm, and he alone mourned for eternity.

In the midst of the brutal melee between pure warriors, a fifth-grade demon cultivator shrank the mountains and rivers, appearing behind the young woman’s warrior, wielding a long spear with sharp tips at both ends, ready to sever her head.

Whether or not he would accidentally harm his own ninth-grade martial artist was secondary; he was focused on achieving a battle merit.

As the young woman’s warrior leaned forward, slightly tilting her head, a small, frail elder appeared abruptly on the tip of the spear aimed at her.

With white hair, dressed in purple, and barefoot, the elder had a black-and-white Yin-Yang pattern embroidered on the back of his purple robe. A translucent wine gourd hung from his waist, revealing a galaxy of sparkling stars within, as if he had bottled an entire stretch of the Milky Way.

The emaciated elder had just rushed from the Central Divine Continent. He had some minor grievances with the ascended demon from Jinjiazhou but was ultimately a step too late.

The fifth-grade cultivator once again shrank the mountains and rivers, but the diminutive elder clung to him like a shadow, grinning as he asked, “Do you recognize me?”

The demon cultivator, having failed his ambush, decided to retreat, discarding his life-bound iron spear and instantaneously shifting hundreds of miles away. To his surprise, the spear followed him to the new location along with the elder.

The elder chuckled, “No need for formalities. You’re dead.”

A fifth-grade demon exploded into pieces, along with his Golden Elixir, Nascent Soul, and Yin-Yang spirits, without even realizing what kind of divine powers the old man had unleashed until the very end.

The iron spear clattered to the ground, while the elder remained “standing” at a distance, slapping his forehead in mild regret. “I forgot you wouldn’t understand my hometown dialect. If I had known, I would have spoken in the refined language of the Great Harmony.”

He glanced at the other two battlefields, seemingly uninterested in involving himself.

At the northern ferry of Tongyezhou, Zhou Mi extended a hand, signaling Cui Zhan to respond.

The situation didn’t seem too promising for Xiao Xian, who was currently clad in a “legal robe” crafted from the aura of righteousness intentionally stripped from Tongye and Fuyiao Islands by Zhou Mi. As long as he gave it his all, half of that power would fall upon the Scholar Saint. But if he didn’t go all out, he would have to see how Xiao Xian wielded his sword with all his might.

Furthermore, in retaliation, if the Embroidered Tiger could jump across continents, then Zhou Mi could certainly match that feat with a bit more flair.

On the battlefield of Jinjiazhou, the elder suddenly furrowed his brow. A figure rose high into the sky, looking anxiously toward the southern Fuyiao Island.

This elder was named Yu Xuan—or rather, “Talisman Master Yu Xuan.”

Just as one would think of the poet immortal as the most accomplished, or the martial deity as the pride of the Da Duan Dynasty, when mentioning the “dog days,” one would inevitably refer to a certain someone.

The line of the Lesser Sage, Chen Chunan, monopolized the essence of Confucianism. The Grand Master of Longhu Mountain monopolized thunder magic.

This elder, however, monopolized the art of talismans across the world.

What a situation—six beasts gathered in one continent?

What about Bai Ye? 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 845: The Departure of Bai Ye

First, the true form of the young True Dragon, Zhi Gui, emerged as it actively left the Dragon Ascension Platform, plunging into the sea to engage in battle with the formidable demon, the Scarlet Consort, whose presence clashed with the greater Dao. This led to a fierce struggle between dragons and serpents that could be said to shift the seas. Soon after, Cui Chen’s twelve flying swords from the White Jade Capital arrived on the battlefield to assist Zhi Gui. Then, Yuan Shou struck the True Dragon’s head with a staff, shattering the mountain water formation of the Old Dragon City before hurling it towards the residence, only to be met by a half-drawn sword from the Mo Clan rogue, Xu Ruo, that blocked the remaining half of Yuan Shou's staff.

On the battlefield of Old Dragon City, the demon forces continued to land and attack, while cultivators from Baoping Continent kept falling. 

After the fierce battles atop those peaks, the wilderness of the world swiftly unfolded a series of long bridges and divine stone tablets, accompanied by massive silk ribbons being pulled taut. The great demons, having transported mountains from Tongye Continent and refined them into miniature forms, tossed them into the sea. With a flash of supernatural power, they abruptly rose from the depths, their peaks embedding into the seabed near Old Dragon City, inverted in the ocean, creating an array of flat battlegrounds. Above them, the vast sea of clouds spread across the surface like white mist filling the valleys.

Compared to the young True Dragon, who could only lie on the Dragon Ascension Platform nursing its wounds, the Scarlet Consort was in far better condition. She had received a secret command from the Jiazi Account and, after a brief wait, a multitude of massive ice spikes appeared out of thin air above the sea, tilting toward the long-blocked Old Dragon City. The ice spikes lined up in order, resembling countless trebuchets ready to launch.

Among these ice spikes, several dozen demon cultivators appeared to be sound asleep, trapped within their icy cages, mostly plagued by disease, with two passing travelers included. 

Moreover, a large number of demon cultivators stood atop these ice spikes, diligently inscribing talismans, eager to avoid provoking the notoriously temperamental Scarlet Consort, who might freeze them on the spot and toss them into Old Dragon City. Among the previous two shared rulers of the wilderness, the one who was more mild-mannered was rather more gentle than the other. These throne-level demons, despite having better tempers, couldn’t be expected to be overly lenient. The few exceptions included the wandering swordsman Liu Cha, who liked to roam the world, and Mr. Zhou, who seldom made an appearance.

The Scarlet Consort turned her head with a charming smile and softly called out to a certain "young master." 

A young man in a black robe, his hair tied with a white silk ribbon, hurriedly arrived at the rear of the battlefield—it was Yu Si, the sword cultivator of the Jia Shen Account. 

Yu Si was still concerned for her safety, even if she was a throne-level demon in the wilderness. 

"Are you alright?" Yu Si asked. 

The Scarlet Consort shook her head. "That little brat is still quite tender. Relying on a bit of True Dragon luck and some of the Grand Yang water luck for protection, he merely has a tough body. He’s not worth much, and his water techniques remain unrefined. Even if he succeeds in walking the path of corruption, he won’t reach ascendant realm. His skills are limited, but his temper is not. This battle won’t afford that little brat many opportunities. If I can swallow her before Yang Zhi’s aunt does, then I wouldn’t mind accompanying you to the shores of Central Divine Continent for a little relaxation."

It was only with Master Yu Si that the Scarlet Consort was willing to engage in more conversation. 

The throne-level demon White Ying had already secretly rushed to Golden Armored Continent after the battle in Tongye Continent concluded. 

Previously, the gentleman from Tongye Continent, Zhong Kui, had prevented White Ying from fully unleashing her potential; Zhong Kui and Jiang Shangzhen were the two most deserving of death who had somehow escaped it. 

As for the others, they had already received secret orders from Mr. Zhou. It was difficult for her to extricate herself from the battlefield at Old Dragon City, and besides, she was not keen on mingling in such a grand affair. 

After all, this time the entire Fuyun Continent was set as a hunting ground, with the target being Bai Ye, the one who had slain throne-level demons with three swords. Although the circumstances had turned upside down and he had the advantage of time, place, and people, Bai Ye was still Bai Ye.

Yu Si sighed softly, "Mu Ji has already received Mr. Zhou's bestowed name, Zhou Qinggao." 

The Scarlet Consort smiled reassuringly, "Being Master Zhou’s closed-door disciple is still not as esteemed as your status, young master." 

Yu Si shook his head, finding it difficult to converse with her. 

Understanding that her young master was more interested in the battlefield's developments, the Scarlet Consort kindly performed a divine palm technique to show the mountains and rivers, allowing Yu Si to clearly see the unfolding chaos at Old Dragon City.

At Old Dragon City, the first counterattack by cultivators in over ten days began in a grand manner, with as many as three hundred Qi Refiners rushing out of one of the three great gates, charging toward the sea.

Yu Si was taken aback. "Da Li is very pragmatic; it doesn’t align with the character of the feudal lord Song Mu. He wouldn’t typically engage in such a futile clash."

Once the cultivators from Baoping Continent stepped out of the great mountain water formation of Old Dragon City, especially when they left solid ground for the sea, they lost the protection of the other two formations.

The Scarlet Consort explained with a laugh, "It’s another bizarre technique from the Grand Yang world. They’re just paper puppets, lacking any real lethality; they’re meant to intimidate." 

Yu Si nodded, "So that’s the unique divine technique of novelist cultivators. After all, they can depict various mountains and rivers of the mortal world with their pens. Creating hundreds of Qi Refiners to deceive is indeed not surprising. I previously heard Liu Bai mention it in the Jia Shen Account and became curious, hoping to one day journey to the White Paper blessed land. However, Old Dragon City’s actions are not solely for intimidation. It seems Song Mu is quite prudent, which is why Cui Chen dared to place him in charge of Old Dragon City."

As Yu Si had surmised, the cultivators who charged out of the city to fight were merely a ruse to deceive the demon cultivators and lure out some hidden offensive treasures. Even if they depleted some of the demon celestial cultivators' spiritual energy, it was still a good thing. Soon, there would be Da Li cultivators responsible for supervising and inspecting the battlefield, meticulously documenting every detail. On the battlefield, Old Dragon City wouldn’t overlook any trivial profit.

Such measures, large and small, emerged with fresh variations every day, and both sides operated in this manner.

Zhou Mi never personally managed affairs, directing actions from various military tents; Cui Chen did the same, leaving all matters of Old Dragon City to the feudal lord Song Mu.

As for personally engaging in battle, that was even less likely. A single misstep could lead to certain death.

The infrequent interventions from Zhou Mi and Cui Chen were, in themselves, a significant protection for the top-tier combat forces within their respective camps.

Anyone daring to complain that while all others were fighting to the death, only these two celestial figures were exempt from danger would likely meet a grim fate.

A female demon who had once displayed a river and water scroll on the battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall noticed the chaotic situation at Old Dragon City and coldly laughed as she summoned a scroll depicting a mountain range, the peaks resembling sword tips.

The painting flashed and instantly broke through the defensive formation of Old Dragon City. Although it was partially pierced by several sword immortals using flying swords and damaged by other Qi Refiners with spells, the remaining half of the mountain scroll still unfolded above Old Dragon City, and the peaks swiftly descended, akin to colossal flying swords crashing down upon the second layer of formations guarding the residence.

Does Da Li possess sword ships?

Hundreds of peaks, like enormous flying swords, fell like a torrential downpour upon the small lotus flowers.

Upon hearing of this in the conference hall, Song Mu merely nodded, remaining focused on discussing battlefield arrangements with the military officers and numerous civil and military secretaries.

I am a feudal lord of Da Li, not some upper-grade cultivator; whether through the defensive formations of Old Dragon City or based on certain private agreements with the assistance of an immortal by my side, it is none of my concern. 

The reclusive sage, known as Cao Rong in the Frosted Moon Dynasty, sighed. Seeing the female demon unfurl her scroll, he simultaneously took out a treasured item he had kept for most of his life. It pained him, truly pained him.

It was a scroll of landscapes and flowers, featuring one scene each for the four seasons of landscapes and four for flowers and birds, all personally painted by him, which he took great pride in.

The unparalleled rarity of this scroll lay not in the paintings themselves, but in the presence of a seal stamped on one of the pages.

The three headmasters of the White Jade Capital in the Azure Sky world had all left their seals on it, as if “sealing the deal.”

The headmaster who accepted disciples in place of the master had the seal “Dao Jing Shi.” 

The second headmaster, who was Cao Rong's second master, the truly invincible Dao Lao Er, also extraordinarily produced a seal that was not easily issued: “Literature has the first, Martial Arts has no second.” 

The third headmaster, Lu Chen, who was the teacher of the sage, had the seal “Stone to the Present.” 

In the Great Xuan Du Temple, the old temple master Sun Huaizhong had the seal “Peach Blossoms in Bloom Again.”

These four landscape paintings were all obtained with the help of his master, Lu Chen. 

Otherwise, based solely on Cao Rong's identity as Lu Chen's direct disciple and his long absence from the Azure Sky world, how could he have such connections? The headmaster would likely give him a favorable response, but the proud second master and the old temple master Sun, who was most opposed to the White Jade Capital, would never grant such a favor.

The remaining four paintings of flowers and birds were sealed by the old sage himself after requesting others to stamp them. 

The Grand Master of Dragon and Tiger Mountain in Central Divine Continent had a private seal “Chick Phoenix.” 

The talismans were profound, and the seal read “One Cry Shocks the World.” 

These two individuals were revered old immortals among the top ten in Central Divine Continent, held in high esteem and with exceptional Dao skills. 

The seal from the Fire Dragon True Person of Northern Julu Continent was carved in a hurry because the old immortal couldn’t refuse the request; it bore the inscription “Chirping Nonstop.” 

The final painting carried a personal seal from the embroidered tiger Cui Chen, reading “White Eye.” 

Sage Cao Rong sighed as he successively tore off four landscape paintings, holding one to throw it out, pasting it onto the great mountain water formation of the residence. The seasons flowed like a small Daoist realm, which truly was not small. Especially the four seals, the smallest no larger than a thumb and the largest no bigger than a palm, suddenly expanded, shining with precious light, overflowing with the essence of the Dao. Among them, the words Dao Jing Shi exuded a gentle aura, while the four characters from the old temple master of Great Xuan Du Temple bloomed peach blossoms in that realm, both real and illusory. The words “Stone to the Present” from Master Cao Rong exuded the essence of a steadfast pillar, especially the eight golden characters belonging to Dao Lao Er, which radiated with unmatched sharpness and were the only seals capable of actively attacking the demon’s mountain peaks with flying swords. 

Cao Rong carefully tucked away the remaining half of the landscape and flower scroll into his sleeve, chuckling bitterly. “I truly have no face to meet my master now.” 

The old monk jested, “It looks quite valuable.” 

Cao Rong responded, “In the eyes of a monk, what value is there?” 

The old monk replied, “There is what there is, and there is not what is not. First, there must be something, and then there must be nothing; only then can it be true nothing.” 

Cao Rong praised, “Good Buddhist teachings.” 

The old monk sighed, “Indeed… it seems this poor monk is not suited to spar with high-level beings; I always lose more than I win.” 

In one of the paintings depicting the four seasons and landscapes, the clouds parted to reveal a divine fairy emerging. Heavy snow fell, with countless jade flakes. 

The old monk said, “Such a secret treasure may not even be recorded by Da Li…” 

At this point, the old monk was left speechless; after all, the embroidered tiger’s calculations of heaven, earth, and human hearts were truly unfathomable. 

Of course, the old monk had not seen the final flower and bird scroll with the “White Eye” seal; he merely speculated based on common sense. 

Cao Rong laughed, “Currently, my half-brother is reminiscing with Madam Gui within Old Dragon City. As a junior, it wouldn’t be proper for me to undermine my half-brother’s reputation.” 

The old monk understood, “The old boatman from the Guihua Isle of the Fan family often passes through Jiaolong Gorge.” 

Cao Rong nodded.

The reason he referred to him as a half-brother was that the master had never acknowledged this person as a direct disciple.

However, back in the day, when the master traveled across the seas, the old boatman was responsible for rowing the boat, accompanying the master on his journeys. Although he had no achievements, he had endured hardships alongside the master, so the direct disciples regarded the old boatman as their eldest brother.

The eldest brother had many aliases, one of the most famous being Gu Qing Song. He was well-known in Central Divine Continent for having a reputation of “Feigning Nonchalance” and was notoriously strong-willed.

No matter who he fought, regardless of the disparity in realms or the opponent's background, Gu Qing Song had never been intimidated, and he had hardly ever emerged victorious. Yet, at the end of every battle, he managed to avoid death. He had crossed paths with Ah Liang, the city lord of White Emperor City, and the Fire Dragon True Person. Eventually, he returned to the sea as the old boatman, reportedly unable to provoke anyone further, lest the younger generations fall short of him.

With Cao Rong’s intervention to guard the formation, Old Dragon City and the residence were free from worry. 

Suddenly, Song Mu recalled something in the council hall and solemnly reminded, “All cultivators who perished outside Old Dragon City, regardless of whether they left the designated battlefield on their own accord or inadvertently broke the rules, their deaths are still deaths. Remind all supervising cultivators that these Qi Refiners will be recorded in Da Li’s military archives, and no military merits shall be discounted!”

A secretary remarked, “This action contradicts the regulations established by the national master.”

Song Mu turned and glared at him fiercely, “In Old Dragon City, I make the decisions! You just need to follow orders. If the national master wishes to hold the residence accountable, let him come to Old Dragon City to find Song Mu!”

The secretary's eyes sparkled as he cupped his fists, “Understood!” 

This young civil official, filled with emotion, immediately flew on his sword to convey this matter. 

This young man, hailing from the renowned clan of Da Li, for the first time genuinely recognized Song Mu’s status as a feudal lord. 

A young gentleman from the Great Sui Mountain Cliff Academy stood guard at the rear of one of the massive holes in the great formation of Old Dragon City. He assigned three battle lines, reflecting the enormity of the gate, as the gentleman assisted the Da Li cultivators in arranging their formations. Whenever enough spiritual energy accumulated, he would exert himself once. 

This time, the young gentleman casually murmured, “Three hundred thousand blue cavalry units.” 

The so-called “blue cavalry” actually referred to willow branches. 

They clustered densely, exuding a considerable aura. 

Killing those non-cultivator demon forces was acceptable, but their primary purpose was to hinder the advance of the demon army. 

A carefree sage from the Lake Viewing Academy, Zhou Ju, who had only recently returned to the ranks of gentlemen, had made significant contributions on the battlefield of Old Dragon City. However, he had lost his gentleman title at the academy and reverted to being a sage; when would this fluctuating status ever come to rest?

Zhou Ju had acted several times before, even more dramatically than the gentleman from the Mountain Cliff Academy, and at this moment was squatting beside the gentleman from the Mountain Cliff Academy, munching on celestial coins with a crunch, savoring their delicious flavor.

A relatively young cultivator accompanying the army, hailing from the Wind and Snow Temple’s martial family, was responsible for guarding this frail gentleman from the academy. To put it simply, if the latter found himself in peril, the former would take the lead. This was not unusual; it was common for accompanying cultivators on the battlefield.

Although he was very steady in battle, his natural disposition was quite spirited. He turned to the similarly temperamental sage, Zhou Ju, and teased, “Master Zhou, is there a difference between three hundred and three thousand? Did you add an extra hundred?”

Zhou Ju replied earnestly, “The essence of written language lies in its profoundness. It first intimidates the opponent with the aura of weaponry on the pages. To conquer without fighting is the goal. As a leading expert of the Wind and Snow Temple, you shouldn’t be ignorant of this principle; otherwise, you should come to the Lake Viewing Academy and spend a few days with me.” 

The gentleman from the Mountain Cliff Academy merely spoke a single line, and upon sending forth the willow branch “blue cavalry” into battle, immediately sat cross-legged, his face slightly pale, chuckling, “You all can stop now; don’t get addicted.”

The greatest pleasure for Zhou Ju and the martial cultivator from the Wind and Snow Temple during their leisure time was to tease this gentleman, calling him the future head of the academy.

However, the gentleman knew all too well that the current head of the Great Sui Mountain Cliff Academy had been replaced from Mao Xiaodong to the national master Cui Chen, and it was unimaginable who would take over as the next headmaster.

Who would dare to speculate on the inscrutable thoughts of that embroidered tiger?

Suddenly, Zhou Ju stood up and said to the accompanying cultivator with a serious expression, “Protect the gentleman!”

In a flash, he vanished from sight, and near the gate, he spotted a demon girl in a loose black robe, her techniques and powers strangely potent. In the blink of an eye, her body transformed into countless birds, annihilating those willow branch cavalry units. Zhou Ju aimed to confront her! He sought an opportunity to twist off her head and afterwards say, “You were once a beauty.” 

At another battlefield, the situation was even more perilous. Even with the sword immortals from Northern Julu Continent maintaining order, dangers still loomed, as the beasts of the wilderness surged into the gate like a swarm of locusts.
In the Old Dragon City, all cultivators had to admit that the demon race was truly fearless. The demon cultivators had engaged in a deadly exchange with the defenders of Old Dragon City, showcasing their respective tactics for dealing with death. Initially, this led to significant losses among the cultivators on the front lines of Old Dragon City. It wasn't until Secretary Wen from the residence, risking everything, quickly combed through a plethora of secret records that he finally identified the identities of the demon race's death warriors, known as "Nightmare" and "Face Thief," in a relatively new book that lacked proper citations. Only then did the residence devise a response strategy, sending swift sword messages to all sword cultivators, instructing them to search for clues about these two peculiar cultivators, which ultimately helped turn the tide of battle.

A small Thunder Pool suddenly materialized above the battlefield, with lightning arcing across dozens of miles, electric flashes resembling white dragons and five thunders akin to colorful serpents, dancing unpredictably across the land. A demon cultivator, clad in red and black, rode a fire dragon and a water dragon, charging toward the main gate. 

Beyond the great gate, on the distant sea, another formidable demon made its debut—a golden-armored divine general riding a horse and wielding a spear, galloping toward Old Dragon City. Although this beast was not a peak-level demon, it had attracted considerable attention on the battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall in years past. Its golden armor was notoriously difficult to breach, earning it a reputation as a must-kill target among the hidden officials of the Summer Retreat Palace.

If this being had commanded such attention at the Sword Qi Great Wall, how much more so would it in Old Dragon City? Meanwhile, a talisman sect cultivator from the Daoist lineage, though not high in realm and at the Golden Core bottleneck, was highly skilled in the art of inscriptions. Now, combined with a young scholar from an academy, he crafted divine characters with every stroke, producing texts of sage-like wisdom above the South Sea.

Among the combatants was a young female demon sword cultivator, one of the famed Hundred Sword Immortals of the Moon-Supporting Mountain. Her youthful appearance bore faint traces of her demon lineage on her forehead and cheeks, and astonishingly, she was advancing even faster than the golden-armored divine general. She did not ride a sword; instead, every leap she took conjured a white jade step beneath her feet. Behind her, a radiant light like a lunar halo followed her, shattering upon impact with the flying swords or spells from Old Dragon City, only to reassemble within moments. Having trained for several years at the Sword Qi Great Wall under the watchful eye of the Dragon King, she had obtained the sword intent "Burning Flower," the flying sword "Shattered Mirror," and her innate divine ability "Reunion." Both sword and body were equally resilient. It was certainly possible to perish on such a battlefield, but as a sword cultivator, one could not afford to cower in fear.

After all, she had battled for years on the Sword Qi Great Wall; she did not truly believe she would meet her end in such a trivial place. In the future, if she were to die outside the gates of the Central Plains’ Literary Temple while delivering a sword, she could accept that without much fuss!

Meanwhile, an old Earth Immortal cultivator from Old Dragon City suddenly rose in a flurry, slaying a large number of enemies. Just as he was about to fulfill his ambitions, accumulating enough military merit to leave the battlefield and return to his sect in the state’s heartland, a familiar face emerged from the pile of corpses behind him—one of the familiar-faced cultivators from the Treasure Bottle Continent. With a claw, the demon ripped out the Earth Immortal's heart, devouring the Golden Core whole, and then the puppet collapsed, blood spilling from its mouth.

Nearby, an old sword cultivator from the Treasure Bottle Continent, a veteran Yuanying stage sword immortal, searched for the elusive demon's true form. Unable to locate it, he reluctantly summoned his innate flying sword, "High Branch," enveloping the pile of corpses in a grand circle of sword light. Then, the sword light crashed down, obliterating most of the bodies, leaving only a few intact corpses.

Unexpectedly, it was still that puppet, which suddenly darted away. The old sword cultivator directed his flying sword toward it, only to be surprised when the body of the previously disemboweled cultivator instantaneously fled in the opposite direction. At the same time, the initially revealed puppet’s body softened, about to plunge into the sea.

In the blink of an eye, the old sword cultivator was caught off guard. Instinctively, he slightly restrained his sword intent and, instead, sliced the puppet in two. Immediately after, he retracted his flying sword to strike down the heartless corpse, knowing the true demon essence was bound to the latter. With a surge of sword light, his momentum was like a rainbow.

Li Cai was speechless. 

What kind of foolish antics are you pulling? 

Even though this out-of-towner, a female sword immortal, was indeed exhausted, she still made an effort to invoke her flying sword, completely shattering the puppet that had just been bisected, obliterating the demon's soul hidden within the guise of a human cultivator.

Glancing back at that old fellow, Li Cai couldn’t be bothered to speak. She needed to return to Old Dragon City for a few good drinks to regain her spirits. First, a long and restful sleep, then back to battle. 

As for the old sword cultivator who appeared to be quite aged, given his Yuanying aura, he was certainly a newcomer. Yet his Golden Core was an ordinary grade, suggesting he had been honing it for quite some time.

How was it that his battlefield experience was like that of a fledgling? 

He seemed to be an "old sword immortal" hailing from Zhengyang Mountain? 

Goodness, my dear mother! 

Just looking at his insight and the decisiveness of his strikes, one could say that even my mischievous apprentice, Chen Li, might not measure up to him. 

However, that old sword cultivator from Zhengyang Mountain had already cupped his hands in gratitude to the renowned female sword immortal from the North Pole Continent. 

Indeed, the Master of Floating Water Sword Lake, Li Zongzhu! Cultivators from both continents recognized the prowess of this female sword immortal. 

A true sword immortal! Her swordsmanship was exquisite, and her innate flying sword never missed its mark, always yielding significant results! 

If given the chance to visit the ancestral hall of Zhengyang Mountain in the future, I must pay my respects and seek her guidance on swordsmanship.

Li Cai almost rolled her eyes in response to the old sword cultivator’s gratitude. She barely managed to hold back her irritation and refrained from saying too much—one doesn’t strike at a smiling face. 

If you had that kind of look in the Sword Qi Great Wall, and others saw you, it wouldn’t just be the Hidden Official who would laugh. Even our little Hidden Official would be rolling on the ground with laughter. 

The Sword Qi Great Wall was filled with peculiarities, and among the lesser-known oddities was that the young hidden officials were particularly zealous when dealing with the demon race, especially those who were known for shifting mountains. 

Li Cai had once privately inquired whether there was a significant grudge with that Yuan head. Was it just because of the bottleneck in their realm that they had to vent their anger on Yuan’s disciples and grandchildren? 

At that time, Chen Pingan had given a reason that Li Cai considered a joke. He said, "When Ning Yao and I first risked our lives to join forces against an enemy, we still couldn’t gain an advantage." 

Li Cai was puzzled. Had Yuan ever acted against Chen Pingan and Ning Yao? Or had they merely crossed paths with a major demon during a fierce battle but failed to make a significant impact? Just like the young hidden official had briefly sparred with Fei Ran, only to quickly brush past each other? 

As Li Cai flew back to Old Dragon City, she was ready to drink. In fact, her current posture on the sword was already swaying, indicating that she was quite tipsy. 

To hell with the Immortal Realm; it’s truly hopeless now, and I've even ruined my last chance. Who can I blame? Blame the wine, I suppose. 

Meanwhile, on the Dragon Ascending Platform, far from the battlefield, Wang Zhu had recovered somewhat and could sit up. Her robe, resembling an ancient dragon robe, was markedly different from the royal dragon robes of later generations. 

Once a semi-immortal weapon cloud sea above Old Dragon City, combined with a relic from a dilapidated cave, it had become an undeniable immortal weapon. 

The young boy in yellow sitting idly on the steps suddenly stood up, his expression stern. "Ma Kuxuan, please halt!" 

Alongside Ma Kuxuan, who had a cat perched on his shoulder, were a handful of personal maids and a direct disciple he had taken in years ago, whom he had named Wang Zuzu. 

This young boy in yellow felt particularly displeased about the name "Wang Zuzu," as it seemed to phonetically resemble his own master’s alias, "Wang Zhu." 

Ma Kuxuan chuckled, "Little critter, back in Mud Bottle Alley, you could only scurry about. Now that you can finally speak, cherish it and don’t seek death recklessly." 

The boy in yellow replied, "One must watch the snake to see its owner." 

Ma Kuxuan gazed at the serpent with four legs and horns reminiscent of the Pearl Cave. 

The latter stepped back, its heel bumping against the step. 

Sitting atop the steps, Wang Zhu waved her sleeve, sending the useless minor figure flying. She looked down at Ma Kuxuan. "What brings you here?" 

As Ma Kuxuan was about to step forward toward the Dragon Ascending Platform, Wang Zhu narrowed her eyes. "Think carefully first." 

Ma Kuxuan wasn’t afraid of her; his body had the strength of a Ascending Realm, but his cultivation didn’t match. He had long been seen as a figure good at killing, but in reality, his expertise lay in self-preservation. 

Ma Kuxuan simply didn’t wish to provoke her anger. Wang Zhu was already in a foul mood, and there was no reason to worsen it for him. 

So, he gazed up at her and said, "I’ll try to help you regain some face, but I can only try." 

Wang Zhu smiled coldly. 

One of the ten young candidates, and yet their arrogance was greater than that of the ten from the Central Plains. 

Ma Kuxuan replied with a smile, "I’m not saying to slay that Scarlet Concubine. I’m not one to dream." 

That individual from the Central Plains, one of the ten, the old sword cultivator Zhou Shenji, had been killed by a major demon. 

Of course, this was closely related to Zhou Shenji’s consecutive battles at the Water and Mountain Cave, but the difference between winning and killing an opponent among Ascending Realm beings was immense. 

The Scarlet Concubine, also one of the fourteen thrones of the barbaric world, was not foolish enough to seek death on the battlefield. It was better to find opportunities from afar and call out when possible. 

In the current battlefield, certain existences that both Xiu Hu and Zhou Mi were concerned about would likely die the moment they made a move or revealed themselves. 

This young woman, Wang Zhu from Mud Bottle Alley, had just taken a heavy blow from Yuan’s strike! 

Currently, Ma Kuxuan faced criticism in Old Dragon City, with some believing that since he was one of the ten young candidates of the world and could command divine beings to attack the celestial dome, he should be on the front lines, making achievements befitting his status. Others felt that Ma Kuxuan, as the leading young figure of the Treasure Bottle Continent, was too reclusive and should learn from that sword immortal Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple, who boldly questioned the strong. 

Unless he heard it directly, Ma Kuxuan typically didn’t care. Once, outside the residence of Old Dragon City, he happened to overhear and said to the face of one of his critics, "The title of one of the ten candidates isn’t worth much; I’ll give it to you, and then you can go die." 

Wang Zhu didn’t respond further, merely turning her gaze northward. 

In the surrounding region of the Southern Mountain, mountain-moving apes, mountain-chasing dogs, yellow-turbaned and silver-armored warriors from the talisman sect, and puppeteers from the Mo family continued tirelessly to build layer upon layer of defensive lines. As long as the Great Li Dynasty had funds and the North Pole Continent as a support, manpower and resources were not an issue. 

Fortifying the walls and clearing the fields? No need. When Old Dragon City fell, nothing would remain for the demon race—only a complete ruin. 

Even if the demon army pushed all the way to the foot of the Southern Mountain, it would remain the same. 

Ma Kuxuan merely watched that cold and lonely girl. 

Very well, she had always been different back in the Pearl Cave, and thankfully, she still remained so. 

In Mud Bottle Alley, he in Apricot Blossom Alley, they didn’t meet often. The most frequent encounters were during early mornings by the iron-locked well, watching her pretend to struggle while drawing water, which he found utterly adorable. Sometimes she would sleep in and be late to fetch water, so he would wait a little longer. They always managed to see each other. 

Suddenly, Ma Kuxuan asked telepathically, "Is that Hidden Official the Eleventh your true bond?" 

Wang Zhu seemed to brighten at once, smiling mischievously. "If I didn’t kill you before, I might just do it in the future." 

At the same time, on Tongye Continent, the Tongye Sect had imprisoned a large group of young cultivators, all without exception the sect’s most outstanding talents. 

The less exceptional young ones had perished, killed by their own master, a venerable ancestor, and other guests. If not, they wouldn’t have been able to explain the situation at the century ledger. 

While it was true that they were confined, the punishments from the immortal realm were not lacking. However, among them, six of the most gifted were held within the shattered ruins of the Wutong Cave, belonging to the Tongye Sect. 

Li Wanyong, Qin Shuihu, Du Yan, Yu Xin, Fu Haizhu, and another outsider who had inexplicably become a direct disciple of the Tongye Sect—Wang Shizi, a Golden Core bottleneck sword cultivator, who would soon break through. 

These young individuals were the "disgraced disciples" of the Tongye Sect, who had insisted on staying. 

Even Li Wanyong, who had nearly collapsed due to the circumstances surrounding the left and right, made the same choice. 

As for the sect leader of the Tongye Sect, the immortal realm sword cultivator Fu Lingqing, he had long since perished in battle. 

If not for this, the current Tongye Sect would have been left with no incense in the ancestral hall, completely severed, replaced by a reputation whose lineage was uncertain. 

The newly appointed elder of the Tongye Sect opened the mountain and water restrictions, arriving at the dilapidated ruins that covered no more than a few dozen miles. Compared to the complete small cave of years past, it was a sight to behold. 

The elder did not proceed further. Among the six young cultivators, some continued to practice their swordsmanship diligently, while others looked up at him, their eyes filled with hatred, sorrow, and confusion. 

The elder offered no explanation, instead displaying a somewhat unfriendly demeanor, as if he had come solely to prevent these sect traitors from hatching any treacherous plans. 

With just a few glances, the elder soon turned to leave. 

A sect had completely fragmented, on one side the old and timid, on the other the young willing to lay down their lives. They stood off against each other, leading to the absurdity of mutual slaughter—a joke witnessed by both the righteous and barbaric worlds. 

Since the death of the founder of the Tongye Sect, Du Mao, the sect had been subjected to ridicule; they had grown accustomed to it. 

Unlike many old cultivators of the Tongye Sect, the elder was not particularly afraid of death. His realm was stuck at a bottleneck, his body decaying, and his spirit flickering like a candle in the wind. 

Since he did not fear death, he had to do something even more fearsome, like leave a legacy worthy of the term "inheritance" for the Tongye Sect. 

Those young ones behind him were the key. 

But for them to survive, a clear line must first be drawn. 

If the barbaric world won and claimed the entirety of the righteous world, then these children would ultimately have a chance to re-emerge, redeeming themselves. Even if they retreated to the Tongye Sect to cultivate in peace, they could lead a stable life in the mountains. The demon race in the barbaric world revered strength; as long as their realm rose, they could find even greater freedom than in the righteous world. 

However, if the barbaric world lost and retreated to the wild lands south of the Sword Qi Great Wall, they would still have choices. 

As the oldest in the Tongye Sect’s ancestral hall, a dying man could do little for the ancestors’ portraits. 

Those young people willing to sacrifice for the sect’s honor must not perish! 

In the southern part of Tongye Continent, the Yuguizong, having held power for a few years, had already seen its master die, including the once-adorable Liu Xiaogirl and later, Sister Huamao, both having fallen in battle. 

Even if the ancestral hall remained in the future, who would still curse themselves? Wouldn’t it be lonely then? I, Jiang Shangzhen, would surely feel lonely to death. 

A figure suddenly appeared, hardening against a waiting Ascending Realm demon's spell, crashing into the last mountain and water formation of the sect, then leaping toward the Nine Strategy Peak. 

Taking advantage of the temporary absence of others, it was a perfect opportunity to practice. 

Jiang Shangzhen spat out blood and declared, "Prepare to greet your guest with a sword!" 

The Nine Strategy Peak trembled, and countless chess pieces emerged, forming nine sword arrays with nine flying swords. 

Old Xun, don’t blame me for squandering our family’s fortune; the old ones have nearly all perished, and the young ones really cannot endure! 

On the Treasure Bottle Continent, the Wind and Snow Temple sword immortal Wei Jin, along with the top sword cultivator from the North Pole Continent, Bai Chang, and the master of the Qingliang Sect, He Xiaoliang, rushed toward the West Mountain region. 

As for He Xiaoliang’s half-brother, the old boatman, he had already bid farewell and set off for Old Dragon City alone.
Under the instigation of the Great Li Dynasty, this group of top-tier warriors was tasked with guarding the western region of the Baoping Continent against invading demons. Their relationships were complex: Wei Jin with He Xiaoliang, and He Xiaoliang with Bai Shang. Especially Wei Jin, who had abstained from alcohol for years but had recently taken to secretly enjoying the wine brewed at the Wind and Snow Temple, seemed to have transformed back into that roguish figure who rode a donkey with a wine flask slung over his shoulder.

As for He Xiaoliang’s Qingshuang Sect, their conflicts with Xu Xuan and his master Bai Shang were well-known across the two continents. Bai Shang had once declared that He Xiaoliang should never expect to ascend to the Immortal Realm. This made the relationship between Wei Jin and Bai Shang, two sword immortals who were previously unrelated, quite delicate.

Wei Jin couldn’t help but curse at the embroidered tiger—what were you thinking, forcing us three together? After their reunion, He Xiaoliang had been courteous to Wei Jin, not attempting to distance herself, yet the more she did so, the more Wei Jin felt compelled to drink. Bai Shang, who had been in a rather indifferent mood, found himself surprisingly amused by the situation, his spirits lifted.

In the region of Central Mountain, the Mountain Lord Jin Qing had, apart from manifesting a towering golden body to protect the National Master at the White Jade Capital, often been engaging in dealings with his old friend Ruan Qiong. In the past, the Zhu Ying Dynasty was the most prominent place for sword cultivators on the Baoping Continent, and Ruan Qiong, as the foremost swordsmith of the continent, was certainly familiar with Jin Qing, who hailed from a mountain lord’s lineage.

As the chief offering of the Great Li Dynasty, Ruan Qiong had long ago imparted his swordsmithing mastery to the sword cultivators of Great Li. However, he still needed to personally forge swords for those celestial sword cultivators, crafting weapons that were serviceable without overly focusing on their quality. Additionally, he had to divert part of his attention to guide other swordsmiths, pointing out flaws in their craft. These unnamed disciples of the swordsmiths were tasked with creating long swords for all cultivators at the Middle Fifth Realm, while those still in the Lower Fifth Realm were not even qualified to enter the battlefield. Moreover, the Great Li Dynasty strictly forbade these sword cultivators from leaving their sects; without exception, all were placed under house arrest by their elders. It was not that they were unwilling to send them off to die; there were strict orders from the Great Li, so why not comply?

Sword cultivators from the Baoping Continent were often referred to as “golden nuggets in a straw nest,” a phrase once coined by their northern neighbor, the Bei Ju Lu Continent. Indeed, they couldn’t compare to the extravagant style of the Bei Ju Lu.

However, the cultivators on the mountains of Baoping Continent had gained immense respect for the Bei Ju Lu in recent times. In fact, sword cultivators from Bei Ju Lu, especially, had changed their views about this previously regarded small continent, which they thought was only slightly better than the Ai Ai Continent. They realized that those who dared to fight were genuinely fearless and capable. They had failed to notice that their southern neighbor resembled Bei Ju Lu in so many ways—there was no other place quite like it in the vast world of Haoran!

At the Shujian Lake True Realm Sect, Sect Master Wei Ying, Chief Offering Liu Lao Cheng, and Offering Liu Zhi Mao, three experts from the Upper Fifth Realm, were heading to the coastal Jiang Clan in Yunlin. Besides them, there was also the Daoist Celestial Xie Shi, who brought along a large group of sword cultivators and Qi practitioners from Bei Ju Lu. Among them was Yuan Ling Dian, recognized in his homeland for his “Jade Purity Realm” strength equivalent to that of an Immortal. He was a senior disciple of the Fire Dragon True Man, the founder of the Zhi Xuan Peak lineage.

There was also a sect known for being invincible but had a notorious reputation for having a gang of “Invincible Fist” fighters. The old gang leader met his old friend Liu Lao Cheng, once the only wild cultivator at the Jade Purity Realm from Shujian Lake, who had now become a revered figure in the True Realm Sect. Life was unpredictable indeed.

After meeting his friend Liu Lao Cheng, the old gang leader, still with his roguish demeanor, had several rounds of drinks. During their last round, Liu Lao Cheng could no longer restrain himself and said, “Old Xun has left us just like that.” The old gang leader gulped down a large mouthful of wine, “That one-foot spear wasn’t much of a skill, but the guts were there. In the end, it was poor luck. What else could be done?”

After a long silence, the elder raised the wine jug and poured some southward, murmuring, “Brother, your one-foot spear from Tongye Continent was never impressive in front of my Jade Face Young Lord. I never expected you’d die so heroically. If I had known back then, I would have smiled at you more and said a few more good words.”

In the capital of the Great Li Dynasty, the well-established Mo family from the Central Plains had already invested in the Baoping Continent's Mo cultivators, building several mountain ferries and sword boats for the Great Li Dynasty. The Great Li was adept at making money, and Mr. Fan was especially so.

The best official of the Great Li’s Ministry of Revenue, once humorously referred to as the “soft persimmon” that anyone could squeeze, had become one of the most irritable figures in the Great Li court. He even dared to scold the Minister of War; as for the Minister of Works, he treated him like a sworn enemy, not just scolding but even striking him. Each time they met to discuss affairs, he would insult the Minister of Works from the very start, and after finishing their business, he would insult him again. The latter usually departed hastily before he could finish.

The Great Li capital, which once consisted of six government offices on the same street, had now expanded into a large area, gathering all the offices closely together, allowing officials to move freely without hindrance. Former colleagues in charge of construction, Liu Qingfeng and Guan Yiran, often crossed paths again. As the direct descendant of the old master Guan, Guan Yiran was merely filling a vacancy in the Ministry of Revenue, and despite not being promoted, according to the rules of the Great Li court, even demotions were not counted as such. This made many civil and military officials who supported the Guan family quite indignant.

In contrast, Liu Qingfeng, a civil official from a vassal state, had already been promoted to the Right Vice Minister of Works, while Guan Yiran, with both Guan family and military ties, remained just filling a gap in the Ministry of Revenue. Moreover, it seemed as though once the old Guan Minister left, Guan Yiran deliberately distanced himself from any ties to the Ministry of Personnel. Over the years, during festivals and holidays, he never made the effort to visit relatives in important positions in the Ministry of Personnel, nor did he visit even his grandfather's contemporaries, maintaining a significant distance. It was said that an old vice-minister who had left the Ministry of Personnel over twenty years ago, having served three years as a minister in another department before retirement, had treated Guan Yiran like a close grandson. This old man had been idle in the capital for many years, but Guan Yiran, the ungrateful young rascal, never paid him a visit. This infuriated the old man so much that on the second day of the first lunar month last year, he waited for a long time at his door but never saw the young man, who liked to laugh and play, coming around. The old man angrily struck the ground with his cane, cursing that Guan Yiran was not a good child, a little rascal without any conscience.

As the old man turned away, he couldn’t help but blame the old Guan Minister for being too cruel, far too cruel. How could he bully his own child like this?

In Yichi Alley, an old man who had been retired for many years was busy indulging in the joy of raising grandchildren. After all, several of his descendants had achieved some success and did not bring shame to the family, allowing him to walk through Yichi Alley and Chi’er Street without needing to lower his head.

Today, the old man took his grandson for a walk in the garden. The child, who had just started learning to recognize characters with the family tutor, suddenly piped up with a childish voice, “Grandpa, with so many immortals in the mountains and so many fierce beasts in the wild, can’t they just fight it out in the sky? Once they finish fighting up there, we can start the fight down here. When that happens, if it gets too intense, I won’t help out. Since the Ministry of Revenue is lacking silver, I can just donate my New Year’s money; my dad often gets scolded by the officials of the Ministry of Revenue anyway. If I give them money, they probably won’t scold my dad anymore, right? Twenty taels of silver!”

There was too much complexity in all of this, so the old man could only choose bits the child could understand, saying, “Fighting isn’t child’s play. Not only must the immortals in the mountains not fear death, but those on the ground must not either. No one can be afraid of death. Otherwise, it will be like Tongye Continent. If that happens, we two will have to move.”

It might truly mean moving—taking some belongings and some sage books, or it might just mean losing their heads. 

But that last line of thought, what could he say to a child? Not to mention the child might be frightened; he himself often felt alarmed whenever he thought of the worst outcome. Should he drink a few cups of old wine to calm his nerves?

Now the Great Li allowed officials to resign, confiscating half their assets. The remaining half, if sufficient for traveling on cross-continental ferries, could be used to flee north to Bei Ju Lu, free to do as they wished. Great Li would not obstruct them. If there wasn’t enough money, they could borrow. Officials from the Ministry of Revenue and accompanying cultivators would personally arrive to check all accounts. Anyone daring to conceal or underreport their assets, if exceeding one-tenth of their actual holdings, would face confiscation of all their properties. Regardless of age, entire families would be forced to migrate. The Great Li was in urgent need of both money and people at this time.

In places throughout the Baoping Continent that had temporarily escaped the ravages of war, any instigators of brawls involving more than ten people would be executed without question, regardless of the reasons behind the conflict. Cultivators causing chaos in a region would also be executed without hesitation.

In areas of unrest not involving cultivators or demons, those failing to manage the situation effectively would be held collectively accountable, and the criminal minister from the vassal state would be sent directly to the nearest Five Peaks or the Prince’s Mountain.

For all conflicts involving cultivators and demons, depending on their respective sects and ranks, all immortal peaks would be classified into three tiers. From lower to higher, they would manage areas of three hundred miles, one thousand miles, and three thousand miles. Regardless of whether they witnessed the chaos or not, if they failed to apprehend or execute the perpetrators on the spot, they too would be held accountable. Afraid of unwarranted disaster? Then disperse all the sect’s immortal records and keep watch day and night around the sect! There was no need to engage in battle; couldn’t they even maintain peace near their own mountain gates? Such immortals on the mountains were better off not existing.

All wild cultivators in the continent could receive a patrol token engraved by the Great Li’s Ministry of Punishment, allowing them to roam freely within their jurisdictions, regardless of their realm. They could also assist the immortal record keepers. Should they achieve any captures, they could earn immortal rewards, and once they accumulated enough, they could exchange it for military merit in the Great Li. At that point, whether to secure a position in the vassal country’s Ministry of Rites or to retreat to Bei Ju Lu was entirely up to them.

Wild cultivators who were unwilling to go to battle would not be compelled by the Great Li’s iron cavalry or the various vassals. However, any local spirits who dared to abandon their posts would be held accountable by the vassal lords and the entire Ministry of Rites.

Any immortal record keepers who acted independently and removed names from the records would face collective punishment for their entire sect. The leading elder would be executed, and all other cultivators would be exiled to the Southern Mountain region.

The Emperor of the Great Li, Song He, had just concluded a small court session and was resting his eyes in the imperial study, preparing to meet a series of ministers from the six ministries, each with urgent matters requiring his final decision before issuing edicts to the realm.

Song He recalled the words of Cui Zhan, who was both a teacher and the National Master. Today’s harshness of the Great Li under Cui Zhan’s rule and the strictness toward vassals would lead to public sentiment swaying toward the future Great Li under the Song family, should the emperor relax his governance even slightly. 

He couldn’t allow the emperor to lose at least half of the continent’s territory and still not earn a few good words in history from other nations. 

In both books and records, there should be nothing but praise—rest assured.

In the vassal country of Great Li, near Yanzhi County, the once-ominous haunted house from rainy nights was now a beautiful place filled with spiritual energy, a residence for immortals. 

She reached out to tug at his sleeve, shaking her head gently, unable to voice the selfish thoughts that lingered in her heart, the reasons she knew were unreasonable. 

But she simply didn’t want him to go to Old Dragon City. 

He comforted her, “With my skills, I’m not enough to fend off a great demon. Even if I end up doing menial tasks, I’ll do my best to help a little and find peace of mind. How could I bear to leave you alone? I’ll definitely come back.” 

She nodded, lightly holding his hand, knowing that regardless of her agreement, she couldn’t stop her husband.

In a small vassal state fortunate enough to be located in the central region of the Baoping Continent, an old scholar who had closed his doors to guests for many years actually stepped out today to bask in the sun.

However, the usually refined elder was surprisingly cursing today, lamenting the tyrannical and oppressive rule—“Those who have destroyed my homeland and mountains are not far from ruin!”

A group of rascally young men passed by, and the one at the forefront, who had attended a few years of school, asked a dog-headed strategist, “What’s the old scholar talking about? Why does he look like his precious son just got beaten?”

The educated young man quietly replied that the old scholar was cursing the Great Li barbarians for meddling too much and being quick to kill. The questioner wondered if the old scholar had any grounds for his curses. The educated young man, who wasn’t exactly a scholar himself, seemed uncertain and merely said, “Somewhat, I suppose. Our Jiang Master has great knowledge.”

Thinking this, the young man glanced at the old scholar’s retreating figure. 

The old scholar was indeed knowledgeable, but that son of his was a good-for-nothing, addicted to gambling. When he fell into debt, he would pretend to be dead. One time, the gambling den got desperate and beat him up, tying him up, and it was the old scholar who had to plead for him, paying off the gambling debts. 

Because one of the old scholar's students happened to be his tutor. While he hadn’t learned much, he still held great respect for that teacher. The old scholar had often scolded and beaten him, causing him to feel quite indignant as a youth, but as he grew older, he increasingly felt guilty toward that teacher, thus beginning to respect both the teacher and the old scholar. However, that Jiang old scholar’s son was truly a worthless person; even when helped, he later ended up blaming his father.

The leading rascal nodded to himself, “That’s right, nowadays, when we walk down the street, the officials who used to treat us like brothers during drinking sessions now look at us like we’re thieves. It’s quite frustrating.”

In the Jin Jia Continent, Yu Xuan was situated high in the sky of a continent, and he was supposed to be at the site of a temple honoring the sages.

As for the local ascendant elder, Wan Yan Lao Jing, despite being an ascendant cultivator, he was like an elderly commoner, watching time drip away as he aged, waiting for death—he was even worse off than a common old man.

Wan Yan Lao Jing, as the foremost cultivator of the Jin Jia Continent, was highly regarded, but he had been in seclusion for five hundred years before exiting. Almost every century, rumors spread across the continent that an old ancestor was about to break through bottlenecks and resonate with the heavens. However, as time passed and the rumors became more frequent, no one paid them any mind.

Following the Fire Dragon True Man from Bei Ju Lu, Chen Chuan An from Nan Po Sha Continent, and Liu Shi Caishen from Ai Ai Continent, Wan Yan Lao Jing was once considered one of the most promising ascendant cultivators in the Haoran world, recognized as one of the ten peak cultivators in the Central Plains.

As for why he wasn’t fighting against the ascendant demons from the wild in the battleground of his home continent, aiming for a grand and explosive mutual destruction, or why he chose to ruthlessly slay the ascendant cultivators from his homeland, who could say for sure?

Was it because the path was severed, and his spirit and body had rotted away, leaving him waiting for death, thus causing his heart to crumble and giving rise to inner demons that attracted some extraterrestrial evils to seize his heart lake?

Was it due to the immense restrictions imposed by the Central Plains’ temple, leading to long-standing resentment? Or were there various grievances accumulated over countless years? In any case, it all resulted in an eternally unresolved mystery, the truth unknown.

Yu Xuan was not interested in digging deep into the matter. Wan Yan Lao Jing was, after all, a stubborn old man, and their grievances were not insignificant.

Had it not been for the annoyingly rigid rules of the temple, Yu Xuan would have crossed continents to visit the Jin Jia Continent long ago. If he enjoyed seclusion so much, why not just stay hidden?

Yu Xuan glanced back at the northern part of the Jin Jia Continent, sighing, what a clever man Jia Sheng was. When scholars have ill intentions, it can be truly terrifying.

The mirage of Tongye Continent was clearly visible to the elder, standing on the northern part of the Jin Jia Continent, outside the gates of several sects. What a vibrant scene it was for the beings of Tongye Continent.
As Yu Xuan descended to the mortal realm, he dared not venture far with his Yin Spirit. After all, in this land of Golden Armor Continent (Jinjia Zhou), where most of the mountains and rivers had fallen to the savage world, was he looking for death?

Yu Xuan possessed some minor skills in talismans, being one of the ten great masters from the Central Lands (Zhongtu). But what of it? Even the renowned Bai Ye (White Master) was marked for death! 

Occupying half of the vast territory of the righteous world, the Central Divine Continent (Zhongtu Shenzhou) boasted the ten masters known throughout the realm. The most illustrious among them was none other than the poet immortal Bai Ye. He stood alone at the top. 

The other nine were roughly divided into three tiers. This categorization wasn't necessarily accurate but was widely accepted nonetheless. 

There was the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain (Longhu Shan), the pillar of martial scholars across the world, a master of talismans, and Yu Xuan himself. 

In Bai Di City (Bai Di Cheng), there was the female martial god Pei Bei, the leader of a sect and a formidable demon in her own right. 

Then there was the Mo Family's prodigy, famed for his ability to conquer cities single-handedly. Legend had it that as long as one of the ten masters wasn't present, any sect of immortals could be annihilated in the blink of an eye. 

And of course, there was the Old Sword Immortal Zhou Zhenzhi. 

This ranking purposefully overlooked the Central Lands' Confucian Temple. 

Moreover, there were the Ten Heroes of the Righteous Path (Haoran Shijian). However, the noise created by those who spoke of them had grown unbearable, and even Yu Xuan found it tiresome. 

The Sage of the Most Sacred, the Holy Sage, the Sub-Sage—Bai Ye, the Old Master of the Daoist Temple at East Sea (Donghai Guandao), and the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain. 

These were the figures recognized by the true great cultivators at the peak of the mountains, including Yu Xuan. 

Beyond them, discussions ebbed and flowed, with the ten masters and their substitutes being debated endlessly, driven by personal biases and preferences. For instance, from the Sub-Sage line, there was the swordsman Ah Liang, who wielded an overwhelming sword intent, and from the Holy Sage line, the second disciple, Zuo You, whose swordsmanship was unrivaled in the world. 

Yu Xuan soon realized that the ascendant demon had already fled, and that the two young martial artists were unscathed. Strangely, Yu Xuan felt a sense of worry; was he really going to return to the Central Divine Continent empty-handed? Killing or seriously injuring an ascendant-level demon outside the Fourteen Thrones would somewhat ease his conscience. As for the Fuyiao Continent (Fuyiao Zhou), he truly wasn't keen on wading into that murky water. It was simply too deep. 

Yu Xuan, being of shorter stature, hesitated, deciding to engage the two young martial artists in casual conversation to ease his mind. 

Unexpectedly, after a smile and a polite fist salute of thanks, Cao Ci took his leave, appearing quite composed. 

On the other hand, the slightly tanned but handsome young girl was more courteous, offering her thanks and not leaving immediately. 

Yu Xuan couldn't help but glance towards the south. 

The Fuyiao Continent had ultimately ceased to be part of the Righteous World, becoming a territory of the savage lands. 

Bai Ye might not care whether he was within the Righteous World, but those six beasts were trampling their own homeland. 

The Grand Array of Twenty-Four Solar Terms on Treasure Bottle Continent (Baoping Zhou) appeared ethereal and seemingly useless, but its most profound essence would be lost on ordinary people. How could Bai Ye not understand? 

A change in celestial fortune. 

As one rises, another falls. 

With the Treasure Bottle Continent cultivators having no chance of winning, a sudden increase in odds would arise from nowhere. Was that not significant? 

When the odds were evenly matched at fifty-fifty, turning into a sixty percent chance? Was it not crucial? 

A ninety percent chance becoming a hundred percent? Would the demon cultivators facing them not tremble in fear? 

If Bai Ye fell in Fuyiao Continent, it would be akin to choosing to stand alone, waiting for an encirclement. 

However, the number and level of the demons encircling Bai Ye would likely surprise even him. 

Yet for Bai Ye, surprises were merely surprises; they wouldn't hinder his swordplay. 

The old man Huai was fond of taking advantage and gaining fame, which is why he went to the South Posa Continent (Nanposha Zhou), where Chen Chuanan was stationed. 

That temperamental old man Zhou Zhenzhi, leaving the Central Divine Continent for Fuyiao Continent—what of it? A hero, indeed! In the coastal waters of Fuyiao Continent, slaying demons was a thrill! But then what? Nothing more. One of the ten masters of the Central Lands, gone just like that. 

He had allowed the old Huai to rise from the bottom tenth to the ninth. 

While Zhou Zhenzhi was alive, he had proclaimed that as long as he lived, he would hold onto the ninth seat. Even if offered the eighth, he would refuse, wanting the old Huai to remain at the bottom for life, to be humiliated beneath him. 

Six demons, indeed. 

What if there was a seventh? 

What a ridiculous "what if"! There surely was! 

At the northern ferry of Tongye Continent (Tongye Zhou), Zhou Mi silently calculated. 

Fuyiao Continent. 

A fitting name, perfect for Bai Ye. 

Liu Cha was indeed on his way to Fuyiao Continent, not bothering to conceal his sword intent, transforming into a beam of sword light visible to the cultivators atop South Posa Continent. 

Mr. Zhou had given this wild-bearded wanderer two options: to assist the Dragon Lord in slaying a younger generation at the Sword Qi Great Wall or to escort Bai Ye on his final journey to Fuyiao Continent. 

A swordsman sending off another swordsman. 

Surely, it was better than Bai Ye dying in the clutches of divine techniques—at least it would be a more honorable death. 

If one wished to be a prominent figure, then one must eliminate the competition. 

Zhou Zhenzhi was merely the first. The deranged ascendant-level Wanyan Lao Jing was an entirely different extreme. 

Indeed, as the ancestor of Mount Tuo Yue had previously stated at the Hanging Mountain ruins, proclaiming to the world, "You of the Righteous World, your freedom is but a fleeting illusion." 

Who bound the cultivators at the peak? Naturally, it was the Confucian rules. The most insidious part was that the higher one’s cultivation, the heavier the shackles. Ascendant beings leaving their continent must always seek permission from the Confucian Temple, the sacred teachers. Only then could they travel far and wide. In the savage world, such rules did not exist. Even in the Taoist-dominated Qingming World, would there be such restrictions? Yet, in the Righteous World, teeming with competing schools of thought, immortals and ascendants were bound by myriad rules. 

Liu Cha chose the second option. 

In the savage world, he hadn't exerted much effort, respecting Chen Qingdu and the sword cultivators. He couldn't reach the Righteous World, consult Chen Chuanan for a sword, and still refrain from drawing a few strikes. 

Bai Ye, like Ah Liang, was the one Liu Cha most wanted to duel with. 

Yet he hadn't been able to spar alone. What could he do? Liu Cha wanted to, but in the end, he couldn't. 

Mr. Zhou said two things before parting: the first was, "Please remember where your hometown is, Mr. Liu." 

The second was, "Mount Tuo Yue requests that Liu Cha draws his sword." 

Outside of that, Mr. Zhou was also calculating Chen Chuanan and the entire South Posa Continent. 

With Zhou Zhenzhi dead and Daoist Mount Tuo Yue and Tongye Continent falling into the hands of the savage world, only South Posa Continent, closest to the Hanging Mountain and Sword Qi Great Wall, remained largely unscathed. 

Once Bai Ye fell in Fuyiao Continent, what of the pure Confucian Chen Chuanan? 

South Posa Continent now had the Huai family ancestor leading the charge, and also had Lu Zhi, one of the ten peak sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, supporting from the side. 

Chen Chuanan, ever at ease, was indeed a Confucian scholar fishing in tranquil waters. 

Zhou Mi halted his calculations, lightly shook his sleeves, and smiled at Cui Chan: "I just need to wait for Zuo You to draw his sword and drive back Xiao Xian. Then, as a student, I'll take half of your life before heading to Fuyiao Continent." 

Cui Chan remained silent. 

It was precisely what Zuo You would do—if he didn't take action, the old scholar would force him to yield and draw his sword. 

Cui Chan's gaze drifted further south. 

Soon, a towering tree and a magnificent watchtower would rise in that direction. 

The old scholar had given Liu Sixteen something to take to Tongye Continent. 

Observing the Dao Temple, Tongye Continent, the phoenix tree. 

You calculate your affairs; I calculate mine. 

I, Cui Chan, do not care for your plots—let alone the life and death of Bai Ye; I am indifferent to how the old scholar and Zuo You fare either. What to say of Chen Chuanan, who hails from the Sub-Sage line? 

Which of these necessitated my concern? 

However, the small calculations of Cui Chan, as a matter of courtesy, would be interesting to see if Jia Sheng dared to disregard it and whether he could truly be indifferent. 

With three frontlines in a single continent, people were dying everywhere, yet the Grand Master of the Da Li Kingdom remained composed, aside from commanding the White Jade Capital and using his flying sword to slay demons, he simply discussed the principles and nuances of the Hundred Schools of Thought with those Confucian disciples. 

Aside from his calculations, dividing his attention to answer the Confucian scholars, an energetic student from the Guanhu Academy unknowingly spoke of the issue of being concerned for a world without borders. 

Cui Chan replied blandly, "To hell with a world without borders." 

A hush fell over the room. 

The speaker was not Cui Dongshan but the Grand Master Cui Chan. 

In Fuyiao Continent, Bai Ye left a quiet corner away from the war, listening to an old master, speaking with a heavy accent, imparting wisdom to young children. 

Bai Ye looked around with a calm smile. 

He wondered if the plum blossoms in his hometown were white. 

It turned out that once his parents passed, he was destined for distant travels. 

As a scholar, Bai Ye felt no regret in this life, nor in the righteousness he upheld. 

And so, Bai Ye took his leave. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 846: The Drinkers Leave Their Names; The Old Master Wants to Flip the Book**

At the battlefield ruins of Golden Armored Continent, a frail old man with white hair and a purple robe, his waist adorned with a wine flask, stood barefoot atop the tip of a slanted iron spear. Yu Xuan surveyed his surroundings, where the ground was littered with the corpses of elite soldiers from the continent and the Qi practitioners from the mountains above. Piles upon piles of bodies were strewn about, a grim testament to the carnage wrought by the demon race, who had constructed this makeshift capital for the skeletal king, allowing the white demon to push northward with these reanimated corpses, aimed at seizing the remaining territories of Golden Armored Continent, which had lost its will to fight.

That white demon was, without a doubt, the most despicable among the fourteen demon lords. If it were allowed to rampage through the Central Divine Continent, it would spell endless troubles. It was already causing havoc in Golden Armored Continent; what would happen if it reached the heart of the land?

Unfortunately, Yu Xuan had arrived too late, failing to stop the deranged Wan Yan Lao Jing or to take the opportunity to confront the white demon. His initial intention for crossing continents was to temporarily set aside grudges with Wan Yan Lao Jing and help Golden Armored Continent buy some time.

Yu Xuan, confident in his talisman-making skills, believed he could handle the white demon's skeletal army. After all, he had a considerable number of talismans at his disposal, allowing him to win by sheer volume. Furthermore, he noted that the white demon was not particularly adept at one-on-one combat; thus, he felt it was safe to join the fray, as long as he avoided imitating Zhou Zhenzhi.

Yet now, as he stood on the spear's tip, feeling the chill of the wind, the old man tugged at his beard, troubled in heart.

The white demon had vanished without a trace, likely having gone to Fuyun Continent to hunt down Bai Ye, seeking to take advantage of the situation.

Yu Xuan wondered how this demon lord, seemingly lacking in direct combat skills, was feeling. Was it as troubled as he was? After all, killing Bai Ye would surely come at a cost.

As he gazed at the young girl approaching him, he chuckled, “You must be Pei Qian, right? Your reputation has grown! You and Cao Ci are both impressive. You youngsters really scare us old-timers; very good, very good.”

Pei Qian had been looking around but stopped to clasp her fists in greeting. “Old Immortal Yu, may I clean up the battlefield? If allowed, it would only take me the time to burn an incense stick. Even half an incense stick would suffice.”

In a mere instant, she could slay a demon practitioner of the Jade Purity realm, and recognizing Yu Xuan’s attire, Pei Qian identified him as the talisman master from Central Divine Continent.

During a past journey home, her master had mentioned Yu Xuan with admiration. To have impressed her master—who had such high regard for him—was no small feat. Today, as this esteemed old immortal visited the battlefield of Golden Armored Continent, Pei Qian felt she hadn’t missed out on Zhou Lao Jianxian, but rather been fortunate to meet Old Immortal Yu. This battle wasn’t fought in vain. Pei Qian had once asked her master whether the yellow talisman on her forehead was worth more than the talismans drawn by Old Immortal Yu, to which her master had only chuckled and served her an extra bowl of fish soup. At that time, the little girl had been quite full, her belly round, and as she received the bowl with a distressed face, she hadn’t known whether she had spoken correctly or not.

As memories of her childhood surfaced, Pei Qian felt somewhat guilty towards Old Immortal Yu, not because of the value of their talismans, but because she had naively called him “Old Immortal” without understanding the honor it entailed. Now that she had the chance to meet him, she felt a deep sense of respect. Moreover, the old man’s demeanor and presence were as bright and grand as the Milky Way, with twinkling stars. She had only glanced at him twice and, after gathering her thoughts, dared not look again.

Yu Xuan nodded. “Are you worried the white demon is hiding among the corpses? Not at all; it has fled. No demon would dare to come and die here now. You can rest easy. Whether it’s the time of an incense stick or even an hour, it’s no problem. But what do you intend to do here, little girl? As a purely martial artist, your realm is impressive, but you cannot appropriately handle these corpses. Let me do it.”

Pei Qian felt a bit embarrassed but replied honestly, “Old Immortal Yu, I want to search the bodies of those demon practitioners for some items to exchange for celestial coins.”

Yu Xuan was taken aback for a moment. A young martial artist, barely a step away from Cao Ci's level, had the audacity to ask if she could pick up money from the corpses?

Was she really a step away from Cao Ci? It was quite intimidating, especially since she was a little girl much younger than Cao Ci. Yu Xuan almost jokingly asked, “Do you have a master? If not, how about this: I am somewhat versed in boxing; you can become my disciple.” Regardless of whether he actually knew boxing, he could always just recruit a disciple first. However, Yu Xuan was well aware that such a young prodigy likely had a formidable master.

He burst into laughter. “Go ahead and gather your treasures; I’ll keep an eye on you for a moment.”

After a moment, they would decide what to do next.

After all, Bai Ye was not so easy to kill.

Pei Qian received Old Immortal Yu’s blessing, clasped her fists deeply in gratitude, and, with a radiant smile, retrieved an ancient seal from her sleeve. With a gentle stomp, the gleaming treasures she had eyed earlier from the corpses of the demon practitioners sprang into the air, and with a flick of her wrist, they entered her spatial artifact.

She darted away, and wherever she stepped, objects from the demon practitioners would rise from the ground and, guided by her precise martial intent, would obediently enter her spatial artifact like guests entering a home.

Earlier, she had borrowed a spatial artifact from Sister Xi and later another from Sister Zhu Mei. The previous skirmishes had yielded little. After all, battlefield clashes were invariably fierce; survival was paramount, and Pei Qian had always been cautious. Today was her only exception. Yet, amid the battlefield ruins, treasures of heaven and earth were abundant, and Pei Qian still intended to leave in the time of an incense stick, not wanting to waste more of Old Immortal Yu’s time.

Although Yu Xuan appeared to be gazing southward at Fuyun Continent, he was actually keeping a close watch on the young martial artist as she scavenged.

He wanted to see if she would keep her promise and only collect the significant treasures from the demon corpses. If she accidentally picked something else, it wouldn’t be his fault if he made a mistake too.

He wasn’t afraid of reckless fighters; what did it matter if they were at the tenth realm or even the eleventh? The vastness of the world held countless paths; each walked their own. What he truly feared were those who were careful about their reputation, who acted like good people for years, only to seize a chance to profit immensely by turning bad.

Yu Xuan had seen plenty of these types; some he could see through, and some he could not, like Wan Yan Lao Jing, who had managed to escape his scrutiny.

The girl had looked into his heart, but Yu Xuan had also glimpsed her heart. What a good girl; she had a light within her, illuminating her path, and it seemed to be growing brighter. She had genuine trust in that light; otherwise, how could she learn martial arts without risking breaking through the heavens?

Very well.

The girl had a keen eye for selecting items and conducted herself with integrity and caution.

Since that was the case, the opportunities were hers to seize; as long as she could see, pick up, and take away, she was free to prosper. Yu Xuan certainly didn’t care much for these lowly items. After all, he was merely cleaning up the battlefield corpses to prevent future troubles; he had no interest in making money. Throughout his life of cultivation, he had never once worried about celestial coins and life-forging objects, as they always came to him unbidden through his own abilities.

What a pity, what a pity! Such a lovely girl, and what was the point of being merely a martial artist? Why not join my sect and learn my talisman techniques? She wouldn’t even need to lift a fist to kill; after all, in Central Divine Continent, there was a saying, “The killing aura comes from the immortal, talismans from Yu Xuan.” Had she ever heard it? Did it stir her heart? There was no harm in being tempted.

Unfortunately, the girl’s gaze was only brightened by the prospect of money, unaware that true celestial coins stood right before her, unmoved.

Just then, the time of an incense stick had passed.

Pei Qian returned to the spot where she had last stood, clasped her fists again, and thanked Old Immortal Yu before taking her leave.

Yu Xuan nodded. This girl was far more pleasing than that brat Cao Ci.

The old man had made up his mind; he would go take a look—just a glance at Fuyun Continent, toss a few talismans, and if it didn’t go well, he would flee.

With blood splattered on her, Pei Qian took a deep breath, preparing to leave the battlefield. Before she departed, she gazed at the corpses, which could never be buried or rendered meaningless. Biting her lip, she silently prayed, “May you all find peace.”

With a slight bend of her knees, she soared into the sky, the earth trembling beneath her as ripples spread out, shattering the remains of the many demon practitioners.

Hearing Pei Qian’s silent wish, Yu Xuan smiled faintly. He lightly stepped off the spear’s tip, landing barefoot on the ground, and as he did, the long spear flipped over, seeming to ride the wind like an immortal, catching up with Pei Qian. With a steady pace, they moved side by side, and Pei Qian hesitated for a moment but ultimately grasped the long spear, inscribed with golden talismans, which belonged to a demon practitioner slain by Old Immortal Yu.

Turning her head, she called out loudly, “Old Immortal Yu, your reputation is well-deserved! No wonder my master said, ‘Talisman techniques are unparalleled, the killing aura of an immortal is profound.’ The talisman arts in your hands resemble converging rivers flowing into the sea, vast and magnificent, setting the Dao of Central Divine Continent high above all else.”

Pei Qian felt a twinge of guilt; her master had never actually said such things. She wondered if her praise had been too excessive. If only her master were here, he would surely know how to temper her words better.

She didn’t dare to look back to the human realm, where sorrowful matters awaited, knowing it wasn’t just her master who was absent from her journey.

It was fine; she had temporarily gained an unnamed master—one who loved silence and spoke little.

A thousand miles from the battlefield, Pei Qian found the child she had been seeking atop a great mountain. She found him squatting on the ground, alongside Cao Ci and Sister Xi, both dressed in white, resembling a pair of immortal lovers stepping out of a painting.

After gracefully landing, Pei Qian called out, “Aman,” but the little mute, unwilling to say a word, merely raised his head to glance at her before looking down again.

Pei Qian glanced at Cao Ci, feeling a bit helpless. It was only after witnessing the standoff between Cao Ci and a great demon of ascension that she realized the truth: Cao Ci had never fought with his full strength in past battles. When it came to killing demons and saving lives, his punches were precise and purposeful, never lacking in force or trajectory, as though he could foresee every strike, thus never needing to rush.

After Pei Qian left on the wind, Yu Xuan stroked his beard thoughtfully. No wonder that girl knew how to show respect; it turned out she had a good master guiding her with great care. He wondered how old she was to possess such composure and insight.

With both hands raised, his sleeves fluttering, Yu Xuan unleashed a flurry of talismans that fell like snowflakes upon the battlefield ruins.

His smile faded, and he muttered as he descended southward, crossing continents, “Let the dead rest.”

The old man stood alone, accompanied only by his talismans.

The one who saves Bai Ye is none other than Yu Xuan of the talismans.

---

**Fuyun Continent.**

Bai Ye stood alone, sword in hand, his green robe flowing as he soared into the heavens.

Beneath him, an entire continent had transformed into a vast array, from the skies down to the earth, cloaked in the chaotic fortune of the savage world. The coastal lands served as boundaries, forming an immense prison designed to capture and overwhelm the lone Bai Ye.

Bai Ye was indifferent; he simply needed to distance the battlefield from the ordinary realm. Immortals fighting often brought misfortune upon mortals, and Bai Ye had seen too much of it to tolerate. This battle marked the conclusion of his life’s swordsmanship, akin to the final verse of a poem, and he could not allow it to end in such a manner.

As for everything else, it was up to you; as long as you were happy, that was enough.

Bai Ye hovered with his sword drawn, surveying the surroundings, his heart steady.

His only regret was not wanting to owe anyone anything; this sword, which had accompanied him for many years, would likely never return to the Daoist Master Sun of the Great Xuandu Temple.

This immortal sword was named "Taibai."

The first time Bai Ye met Daoist Master Sun and the sword "Taibai," it was during Master Sun’s first distant journey to the vast world to unwind. He had initially offered the sword as a gift, but Bai Ye had refused, leading Master Sun to change it to a loan, explaining that the sword’s name clashed with the blossoming peach color of his temple, which brought bad luck. “The immortal sword Taibai pairs perfectly with you, Bai Ye. It’s like marrying off my daughter to the vast world, and I gain a son-in-law. That’s a win-win situation,” he had said, showcasing the old Daoist’s way of thinking.

The only ones Bai Ye felt even a hint of indebtedness toward were three individuals: the venerable ancestor of the Sword Immortal lineage, Master Sun Huai Zhong, his close friend Jun Qian who traveled to seek immortality alongside him, and the Confucian sage.

The Great Ancestor of Tuoyue Mountain, Wen Hai Zhou Mi, and the swordmaster Liu Cha. The white demon, Yang Zhi, the crimson phoenix, and several others like Yuan Shou, Yao Jia, Huang Luan, and the Lotus Temple Master.

In the savage world, there used to be those fourteen thrones.

Yet now, all of that was in the past.

At the end of the battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Lotus Temple Master, who had refined half a moon, had already been slain by Dong San Geng, not only killing a great demon but also bringing down the bright moon.

The great demon Huang Luan, who had refined countless immortal caves and pavilions, was said to have been mostly dispatched by A Liang and the sword immortal Yao Chong Dao, leaving it severely weakened and forced to change its form, becoming a Nascent Soul demon, living in agony.

As for the first throne demon to fall in the vast world, it had disguised itself as Yao Jia, who, according to the old scholar, liked to flaunt wealth, making it the type he detested.

This was a being that had slaughtered countless deities of the mountains and rivers on Fuyun Continent to compensate for its losses at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Bai Ye had unleashed three swords against it, ultimately slaying it amidst the remnants of the Upside-Down Mountain. The first sword sent it off from Fuyun Continent to prevent collateral damage; the second sword served as a return gift to the savage world, and the third sword was Bai Ye's most dedicated strike, a tribute to the valiant sword practitioners who had perished at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In fact, Bai Ye should have unleashed one or two more swords to truly kill Yao Jia.

However, at that moment, someone had intervened, overpowering the great ancestor of Tuoyue Mountain’s abilities.

Otherwise, Bai Ye would not have minded taking his sword and wandering far, coincidentally checking out the remaining half of the Sword Qi Great Wall that still belonged to the vast world.

Now, Bai Ye hovered in the center of the cloud sea above the continent.

Beneath him, the sea of clouds was the white demon's primary means, filled with the vengeful spirits and resentful energies of countless souls, with countless skulls and limbs attempting to rush toward Bai Ye, only to be dispersed by the overwhelming righteous energy radiating from him without him needing to draw his sword.

The white demon no longer sat atop the throne of bones; it stood up, beside it a powerful sword attendant resembling the former Dragon Lord.

Perched upon the floating ancient divine skeleton, the great demon Wuyue gripped a long spear that pierced its skull. Thunder rumbled, and colorful lightning coiled around the spear and Wuyue's arm, the sound echoing across the continent, making Wuyue appear like a supreme deity of thunder returned to the mortal realm.

There sat a three-headed, six-armed giant on a golden book spread out like a mat. The sword mark on his chest had crossed the Sword Qi Great Wall, still only half erased, deliberately leaving the other half behind.

He awaited the moment he could personally shatter the Ascension City of the Fifth Heaven, at which point he would completely wipe away the sword mark.

The great demon Yang Zhi, adorned with an emperor's crown and clad in a black dragon robe, with a head like a dragon and a massive body, floated among the many celestial beings playing pipa around him. At that moment, his old friend Yuan Shou, who had crossed continents with him, was casually snacking on some yellow beans while treating his injuries, having taken quite a beating during the previous battle at Longcheng.

Though the great demon's body was incredibly resilient, even when injured by the ordinary ascended foes, he felt no fear. However, facing Bai Ye, Yuan Shou showed no mercy, and Yang Zhi did not mind the injuries; both sides aimed to restore their peak fighting strength. 

Yuan Shou remained suspended on his sword, a long staff balanced on his shoulder, his hands adorned with a string of beads made from the many mountains of Tong Ye Continent, now bearing additional beads from the large mountains there.
The odds of victory were hardly worth discussing. Whether it was Liu Cha from their own camp or Ah Liang, who had returned from the Outer Heaven to the Sword Qi Great Wall, switching places with Bai Ye would ultimately lead to the same fate. What truly mattered to Yang Zhi, Yuan Shou, and all the other great demons was whether one among the six of them would die, and which one it would be. Bai Ye's final sword strike in this life would inevitably claim a companion to the grave; even if he couldn't kill anyone, being reduced to a pawn in Huang Luan's game would be tantamount to death.

A towering demon clad in golden armor, whose appearance was indistinguishable from that of a human, stood a hundred feet tall. The ancient golden armor he wore not only served as a prison but also provided a meager form of protection. The armor was on the verge of shattering, and streams of thick golden light poured out like water from a creek. He went by the name "Niu Dao," a name that could only be described as crude. Unlike the other throne demons who were fixated on the vast world of righteousness, his true target for revenge lay in the Qing Ming realm, not in the White Jade Capital, but rather with a "young man" who preferred to stay in the Lotus Cave heaven.

The only demon who consistently disliked revealing his true form in the mortal realm was the exceptionally handsome Qie Yun, who wore a sword-holding gourd at his waist. He appeared particularly diminutive, his stature comparable to that of the scholar Bai Ye.

Bai Ying, the Five Mountains, Yang Zhi, Yuan Shou, Niu Dao, and Qie Yun—all came from different battlefields and positions, yet they found themselves in the same moment on the turbulent Fuyao Continent. The six great demons surrounding Bai Ye were all undeniably throne-level demons.

The Lord of the Lotus Temple, Huang Luan, and Yao Jia—these three great demons had already become part of history. Now, there was an additional high-ranking throne, Xiao Shen, along with two less popular ascendant demons. The two new throne demons had previously dismissed the original thrones as inconsequential, merely filling the numbers. In this unprecedented encirclement, Zhou Mi had not even allowed them to show their faces.

Bai Ye smiled and said, "Of the new fourteen thrones coming to Fuyao Continent, less than half look down on me, Bai Ye?"

Qie Yun twirled a strand of hair at his temple and replied with a grin, "Only the Most Sacred Master could say such a thing."

Bai Ye shook his head, "Some things, even the Most Sacred Master might not dare to say."

The implication was clear: there were some words that only Bai Ye could utter in this world.

The six great demons fell silent, perhaps having nothing left to say.

Bai Ye reached out and gently grasped the hilt of his sword. "What are you all just standing around for? Come on and try to kill me. Afraid to take action? Then I might just have to kill a demon myself."

With that, he drew his sword.

The Immortal Sword Taibai gleamed brilliantly, and suddenly, the world was filled with light. The first barrier of the Fuyao Continent, belonging to the savage world, shattered completely. A torrential downpour of multicolored rain fell like crystal, all manifesting from Bai Ye's sword energy, as the sword formation crashed down upon the sea of clouds and the six great demons.

————

At the northern ferry terminal of Tongye Continent, four teachers and students from the Wenhai lineage of the savage world took a stroll together.

Zhou Mi was in a good mood, rare to be with his three direct disciples while reminiscing about old stories.

"The unsuccessful scholar, Jia Sheng, after leaving the Central Land Divine Continent, in order to become the Wenhai Zhou Mi of the savage world, of course had to pass through the Sword Qi Great Wall."

"That self-proclaimed scholar, who aimed to bring peace to humanity for all time, still clinging to his homeland, sought out Chen Qingdu, that old Sword Immortal who was always idling around."

At this point, Zhou Mi chuckled to himself, "It was as if he was pretending to pass down a sacred edict; he claimed to have received the tacit agreement of a deputy master from the Confucian Temple and the head of the academy, saying that as long as the tens of thousands of sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall were willing to assist, they could march together with the qi cultivators of the righteous world to attack the Moon-Treading Mountain in the savage world, thereby expanding the territories of the righteous world. In exchange, the sword cultivators would no longer be treated as prisoners from that point on, and the Confucian Temple would offer a vast expanse of land for them to govern, allowing both sides to live in peace."

A young blind man, filled with the scent of books, spoke up, "In terms of sentiment, reason, and the greater trend, the Confucian Temple should naturally make such concessions. No, they would have to."

Once a disciple of Zhou Mi, known for his lofty ideals, Zhou Qinggao. 

The teacher remarked on how the world had changed, and many good words could turn into bad ones. The name "Qinggao," originally meant something noble, yet in today's world, what was it worth? As a disciple of Wenhai Zhou Mi, he had to strive to turn those words back into something good in people's hearts.

Zhou Mi smiled. "Of course, I need to ensure with Chen Qingdu that at least half of the sword cultivators can survive by the end of the war. Otherwise, the scholars, including Jia Sheng, will be the first to regret it."

Zhou Qinggao curiously asked, "What did that old Sword Immortal say?"

"Chen Qingdu enjoys walking with his hands behind his back atop the city walls. I accompanied him on that stroll for a few miles. He laughed and said this matter had little to do with me; as long as I could convince the Confucian Temple and a few other sword immortals besides him, he would have no issues."

"I was the last executioner in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall. I served for over a hundred years, of course under a pseudonym. Chen Qingdu helped me conceal my true identity. Surprised, aren't you?"

Zhou Mi chuckled, recalling how, although Chen Qingdu was unusually agreeable, he seemed to have never believed that Zhou Mi could achieve anything.

Sword Immortal Shouchen laughed, "I truly never would have guessed."

Liu Bai suddenly asked, "Teacher, why is Bai Ye willing to single-handedly defend Fuyao Continent?"

The teacher only laughed heartily, not explaining anything to his direct disciple.

Zhou Qinggao patiently explained to his teacher and senior sister, "My sister thinks Bai Ye will die in vain?"

Zhou Qinggao shook his head slowly, "Yes and no. It's right and wrong. Zhou Shenzhi, when he was on Central Land Divine Continent, was nearly revered by all mountain qi cultivators, especially the local sword cultivators. He was one of the ten most esteemed figures, even ranked ninth, yet he was still genuinely regarded as unbeatable."

"But after he was killed by a throne demon, many in the Central Land Divine Continent began to voice their grievances for the 'Old Abacus' who ranked last among the ten. Some even believed Zhou Shenzhi was a useless old relic; what kind of sword immortal was he? He might not even be able to leave a mark on the Sword Qi Great Wall in the savage lands. After Zhou Shenzhi's death, with the betrayal of Wanyan Laojing, if it were you, now in the ascendant realm, would you dare to get involved?"

"Isn't Bai Ye's swordsmanship superior to Zhou Shenzhi's? Did he not slay that throne demon in three strikes to avenge Zhou Shenzhi? So if Bai Ye were to die, what would happen? The issue is, if Bai Ye doesn't go to Fuyao Continent, who else can? Who dares to go? Whether Fuyao Continent or Tongye Continent, aren’t they the decisive battlegrounds that determine the fate of the world?"

Liu Bai was not foolish; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been such an integral part of the planning in the past. She nodded, "Ultimately, it depends on the situation in the Central Land Divine Continent. As long as the righteous world can hold its ground, it will be invincible. We will be in serious trouble, quite troublesome. Many of the advantages we’ve built up over time will gradually turn into hidden dangers, surfacing one by one."

Shouchen suddenly interjected, "Bai Ye should know when to stop and return to the Central Land Divine Continent. He has already achieved great merit by establishing a new world. Slaying a throne is enough to have a clear conscience. It's time for others to take the stage."

Zhou Qinggao shook his head, "If Bai Ye thought like that, then the righteous world would indeed become a lot easier to conquer."

Liu Bai greatly admired this disciple whom her teacher had just named. Now, he was her junior brother.

Back at the Jia Shen account, Liu Bai had already admired the military leader Mu Ji's strategic prowess.

Now that they were in the same sect, Liu Bai felt even more inadequate.

With her teacher, Zhou Qinggao never showed even a hint of fear, as if he was never afraid of saying the wrong thing or making a mistake.

When talking to his senior brother Shouchen, he never fell behind, nor did he deliberately try to outdo him in words.

Zhou Mi smiled and said, "You’re all thinking too shallowly."

"Don't think that just because the Sword Qi Great Wall has hindered us for many years, our world isn't strong. Well, if you think so, that's fine. As for my homeland, right beneath and halfway up this mountain in the righteous world, if everyone thinks so, that's even better. It's splendid. Only a few, like Xiu Hu or Bai Ye, dare to remain sober while everyone else is intoxicated. Most people fear this matter the most. Their incessant discussions and complaints will only agitate the mountain deities, who have never had small tempers."

The Sword Qi Great Wall is incredibly difficult to conquer, which is both a curse and a blessing.

After capturing the Sword Qi Great Wall, taking down Tongye Continent and Fuyao Continent would be as easy as turning over one's hand. The morale on the battlefield would not only remain high but would also rise further, and eventually, the Nan Posuo Continent would be breached, along with the Golden Armor Continent and the current Baoping Continent.

"If it weren't for Zhou Shenzhi seeking death, he must die; otherwise, it would slightly disrupt the situation in Fuyao Continent. Plus, this guy is so stubborn and refuses to retreat in battle. I had actually prepared to give him a chance to earn a great reputation, just like Bai Ye's three strikes against the throne? Bai Ye wouldn't even have had the opportunity to strike, because Zhou Shenzhi had wounded the throne demon with a single strike much earlier. This shows that the sword immortals and sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall are all like ants, mere paper figures. Look at Zhou Shenzhi, who is only ranked ninth among the ten in the Central Land Divine Continent. Isn’t there only a total of fourteen thrones? Our old sword immortal Zhou easily took care of one with a single strike. So this battle is actually very easy to win. Those demon beasts, exhausting the true strength of half the world, are not worth mentioning."

"So, they merely fortuitously captured two continents."

"Furthermore, it’s just that the Confucian Temple is too cautious, the Confucian saints are making a mountain out of a molehill, and they lack the courage of true sages. This is laughable and disappointing, even enraging."

Liu Bai listened in shock.

Zhou Mi lightly shook his head, gazing towards the Central Land Divine Continent with a smile. "The world of righteousness hasn't changed; it always teaches one to laugh away tears."

"The strong do not question right or wrong, nor do they distinguish between sides. They must also be unencumbered. As long as the strong are strong enough to sit firmly at the highest position, every word and action—even silence—becomes reasoning, and even the entire world will help them reason it out."

Zhou Mi smiled, "Bai Ye will die. At that time, the righteous world will only witness the truth: the most favored Bai Ye will be slain by Liu Cha of the savage world, and that will be all. Previously, no one was afraid, right? Now you all will be frightened."

From the mountains down to the valleys, discussing bloodshed and death had become second nature. To speak of death as inevitable, to endure it—after enjoying peace for ten thousand years, how could the righteous world compare with the savage world?

When it came to mobilizing the full strength of the world, you scattered sand, each playing in your own mud.

Zhou Mi laughed heartily, then straightened his clothing, shook his sleeves, and proactively opened a barrier of heavenly fate on the continent, bowing to the heavens and earth, proclaiming, "Most Sacred Master, my homeland has left that scholar Jia Sheng in despair for too many years; now it’s my turn to annoy you."

Above the cloud sea of Baoping Continent.

Xu Ruo asked, "This Jia Sheng?"

Cui Chan replied, "Pretentious, concealing his hand."

Zhou Mi turned towards Baoping Continent, "Only Xiu Hu knows me in this world."

Zhou Qinggao asked a pivotal question: "The Confucian Temple?"

Zhou Mi smiled, "Why is that so important? My homeland is not a place for reasoning."

He, Zhou Mi, was more about reasoning, having already spoken for the Confucian Temple, revealing early on why the Central Land’s Confucian Temple was so bound and restricted.

Years ago, Jia Sheng's Twelve Strategies for Peace! Which strategy was not aimed at preventing today’s events?! Which one wasn’t a fundamental cause of the current chaos? A place where even the gentlemen and virtuous could not be the national master or behind-the-scenes ruler, a righteous world where even emperors could not all be Confucian disciples—that's the suffering it must endure today. It is the trouble of the Confucian Temple itself. When it truly comes down to needing people to fight to the death on the battlefield, what will the sages and virtuous ones use to reason? Will they take a few sacred books and go tell those about to die the theories written within?

Years ago, the righteous world refused to heed the Twelve Strategies for Peace I painstakingly wrote.

Now it’s time for them to listen more, think more, and thoroughly contemplate.

What a pity for only Cui Chan. What a waste of a Xiu Hu, who not only would die but would also leave a stench in history for ten thousand years, even if… even if the righteous world won this war, it would still be so, destined to be so.

You Confucian Temple have given the world too many paths to take, given too much freedom to humanity, yet it only makes people feel that no one is free, not nearly enough.

Very well!

You want pure and unrestrained freedom? Then let the Moon-Treading Mountain provide it for you.

You want the strong to be the only rationale? The savage world has always valued this, not just my Zhou Mi’s words.

Zhou Mi quickened his pace, and his three students sensibly let their teacher walk alone by the sea.

Shouchen stopped, gazing towards the battlefield at the southernmost tip of Baoping Continent. The Crimson Concubine had already sent those plague gods and the two visitors to Old Dragon City, and it seemed to be working well.

Zhou Qinggao and Liu Bai turned to walk slowly, Zhou Qinggao fell silent for a moment before suddenly saying, "Senior sister, do you know you like that hidden official?"

Liu Bai was taken aback, then laughed and scolded, "What?! Mu Ji, are you crazy?!"

Zhou Qinggao stopped in his tracks, laughing, "Who is crazy? No one is crazy."

Liu Bai's face turned pale, gritting her teeth, "Impossible! Junior brother, don’t speak nonsense."

Zhou Qinggao continued to walk, "Rather than worry that your future heart demon is that hidden official, why not open your heart and admit that you like him? First, Chen Ping'an will definitely die at the Sword Qi Great Wall; even if we assume for a moment that he doesn’t, you know in your heart that you will never be able to take revenge on him in this life. Then the heart demon will always be waiting for Liu Bai on the path of cultivation. The more you deceive yourself, the more opportunities the heart demon will find."

"Secondly, not only should you like him, but you should also truly like him. Then Liu Bai only needs to hold onto one thought; in the future, she will definitely ask him about the sword at the Ascension City, so that the one who caused Chen Ping’an's death—the true culprit—will let Ning Yao know that Chen Ping'an likes her, but his genuine feelings are not as strong as those he holds for Liu Bai."

Liu Bai was drenched in sweat, still refusing to catch up with her junior brother.

Shouchen and Zhou Mi exchanged silent smiles, "The teacher has taken in a good disciple."

Zhou Mi smiled, "It's normal for the junior brother to surpass the senior brother; just don’t come too early."

"Zhou Qinggao is different from you senior brothers and sisters. He truly admires the Sword Qi Great Wall and yearns for that young hidden official. Thus, his inner denial of the righteous world is heavier than yours. At the same time, he has a greater chance of becoming the Chen Ping'an of the savage world—he must resemble him first in order to surpass him. As for that Fei Ran, he already has his own path to walk; going by the name Chen Yin, he more so finds himself bored after landing on Tongye Continent, not to mention that Fei Ran hardly needs to become anyone else."

"Today, the teacher is in good spirits, so I’ll share a few words with you in advance. I have some young people in my heart that I’m quite optimistic about. Besides you and Zhou Qinggao, Fei Ran, Yu Si, Tan, Dou Kou, and so on—around a dozen or so, but not more than twenty young people. I look forward to your grand accomplishments. Trust me, the teacher will not be disappointed."

"I'll go find She Yue, take her to see that phoenix tree and the Demon Suppressing Tower. Shouchen, keep a close eye on the battlefield in Old Dragon City with your junior brother."

Shouchen accepted the order.

Teacher Zhou Mi, meticulous and thorough, in his dealings with the world.

Junior brother Qinggao, clear waters and high mountains, in his dealings with the world.

————

The old scholar sat unsteadily at the edge of the Southern Posuo Continent’s heavenly curtain, not far from a companion sage from the Li Sheng lineage, one who was temporarily not interested in speaking while the other was waiting expectantly for conversation, knowing that the old scholar would inevitably speak, and there was no stopping him.
"All you wise sages have always been lonely since ancient times—what a hard life it is," the old scholar coughed a few times to clear his throat. Indeed, in the grand scheme of the world, it was not easy for him to spit out even a few drops of genuine blood, so he used it as an excuse to complain. He first expressed sympathy for others' struggles and then began to grumble to the sage beside him, "I’m not doing any better! Forget about the merits recorded in the Confucian Temple; I’m not concerned about one or two entries. But you must remember to give me an additional mark for my contributions. In the future, when there’s a dispute at the Confucian Temple, you have to stand up for me and say a few fair words."

The sage accompanying him nodded and replied, "To speak fairly, I’ve said everything I needed to say, not leaving out a single word, O Sage of Literature. As for what I shouldn’t say, even if you roll around here throwing a tantrum, it won’t matter."

The old scholar sat cross-legged and thumped his chest in grievance. "Your family’s master is so magnanimous in his actions, it’s no wonder he can’t earn a prefix in front of the title 'Sage.' Just look at me; you should learn from me..."

The sage replied directly, "I’ve seen enough. It’s something I can’t replicate."

The lineage of the Ritual Sage in the Confucian Temple had always been closest to the lineage of the Sage of Literature, whose incense offerings had thinned over the years. If not, the Grand Sacrificial Wine Master of the Ritual Academy wouldn’t have been so eager for the Sage of Literature’s line, though not of direct descent, to stay in their academy and devote themselves to scholarship.

In the past, the officer overseeing the Sword Qi Great Wall, a gentleman from the Ritual Academy named Wang Zai, wouldn’t have taken the initiative to speak those veiled harsh words to Chen Ping’an, who wasn’t even a Hidden Official at the time. In the end, he even asked Chen for a seal inscribed with "The sun shines by day, the moon shines by night," and rather casually requested that Chen sign it, as if it were nothing.

The old scholar sighed, feeling it was exceedingly dull. If he weren’t too lazy to wander elsewhere, he would have long sought out someone more interesting for a chat. 

In the Central Plains Confucian Temple, there were a total of seventy-two accompanying sages. Among them, those stationed to oversee the nine continents year after year were merely “staying put like wax figures.” They needed to patrol the brightest lights of the mortal realm day and night, suppressing the actions of all ascended cultivators, ensuring they didn’t leave their designated areas, while also monitoring the movements of immortals to prevent the misuse of divine powers that might harm the people.

For instance, there were three stationed at Tongyezhou and Fuyouzhou, while Baopingzhou, being the smallest, had only two. As for Nanposuo Zhou, due to its proximity to the Upside-down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were as many as four.

Among them, there was once a sage from Fuyouzhou whose temperament was quite compatible with the old scholar. He was relatively talkative and would share a laugh with the old scholar in private, saying that he could see the lights of mortals' prayers and wishes rising higher and higher, feeling that this view of the human realm was truly exquisite.

It was precisely because of this sage's words that the old scholar came up with the humorous term "wax figure." To turn disparaging remarks into genuine compliments was a unique talent of the old scholar.

As for being able to twist compliments into something strange and uncomfortable... "You think that’s something I would care about? I, the old scholar, am a person of letters! Who would dare speak ill of anyone?!"

The old scholar asked, "Is there any wine? Good wine from the mortal realm is endless; just find a wealthy family to borrow a couple of jars. Let’s have a drink together. Just remember, don’t pick that celestial wine brewed in the mountain’s immortal abode—I’m not one to fuss over such things."

The sage shook his head.

The old scholar clapped his hands together. "Then I’ll find Chen Chun’an for some wine later; I won’t even need to borrow. Ah, look at this situation; it seems the scholars of the Ritual Sage lineage are now less grand than those of the Lesser Sage lineage. It’s my fault; I can’t escape the blame. If only there was wine here, I would definitely punish myself with three cups first."

The sage said, "The Sage of Literature says so, so it must be true."

The old scholar burst out laughing. "To stand upright, with a lofty spirit within—no wonder you can be a sage over Chen Chun’an. Those other accompanying sages can’t compare to your grandeur. The only flaw is that you’re a bit stingy on certain small matters."

The sage replied, "If I recall correctly, there was a time when a certain person nearly stuffed his named disciple into a sack and tossed him in the Ritual Academy. And before doing so, he encouraged his disciple, saying that if one day he really became an accompanying sage of the Ritual lineage, he must go to Nanposuo Zhou and guard the heavens. He must help the master vent his anger."

The old scholar vigorously waved his hands in denial. "Impossible, impossible! Mao Xiaodong is the most respectful and devoted disciple; he would never betray his master."

It was unclear whether he was denying or admitting it.

The sage said, "Mao Xiaodong got drunk while with the Grand Sacrificial Wine Master, speaking about his master’s ongoing charisma."

The old scholar stroked his beard and nodded, praising, "That makes sense, really makes sense."

The sage suddenly gazed into the distance beyond the mountain rivers of the continent and asked, "Sage of Literature, can we win? Can we reduce the number of casualties?"

The old scholar pondered for a moment and replied, "Since we can’t do more, just think positively."

There were still some sages in the Confucian Temple who, at the cost of their Dao cultivation, sought broken secret realms in the long river of time, placing them in the territory of the righteous world, either waiting for fated individuals or emerging in response to circumstances. In the end, they would all become new caves or blessed lands within the righteous world. The Confucian Temple itself would never occupy them; otherwise, a former deputy leader once joked that what use was there for sage principles when competing for benefits with the world?

Over ten thousand years, the greatest harvest was undoubtedly that discovery in the Fifth Heaven, uncovering traces and solidifying the path—two significant contributions credited to a certain accompanying sage, who had argued the most with the old scholar and had, in the past, made the old scholar feel most embarrassed during the disputes of years past. Only after the old scholar appeared alongside Bai Ye did that person finally feel relieved and pass away unexpectedly, leaving only a smile when encountering the old scholar.

The remaining accompanying sages, some entirely gone, some half gone, had whimsically and resolutely departed to distant lands, accompanying that Ritual Sage for a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years.

Thus, the old scholar, who had always been most protective of his youngest disciple, never said a word about this distant journey to his current closed-door disciple.

Only when he met the wife that his closed-door disciple had found after enduring countless hardships in the Fifth Heaven, that lovely girl Ning Yao, did the old scholar suddenly feel a wave of sadness wash over him. He nearly broke down in tears in front of his friend Bai Ye and a junior disciple. Truly, such suffering could not be spoken of. It was not just about his closed-door disciple's struggles.

The sage rarely spoke, but with a hint of mirth, recounted an old story of a mutual acquaintance. In truth, compared to their existence, the time that had passed was not far; yet recalling it now felt distant: "My old friend passed through this place years ago and, before returning to Tongyezhou, cursed the Sage of Literature with many unflattering words."

The old scholar scratched his head, then crossed his arms and scoffed. "Let him curse a few times; it won’t cost him a few pounds of meat. If I took it to heart even a little, I might as well not be the Sage of Literature, having read countless tomes of sage literature for nothing!"

The sage smiled again. "The last thing my old friend said was, 'The cold pig head meat from the Confucian Temple is delicious; anyway, that old scholar can’t eat it. That guy can thicken his skin and go to the Confucian Temple one day to sneak a few pieces to eat.'"

The old scholar slapped his knee. "If you want to eat, just eat! Who's afraid? For a scholar to sneak a taste of cold pig head meat, can that be called sneaking?!"

In the past, the old scholar rarely put on a stern face and seriously disciplined a younger disciple who never needed to worry about his studies, telling a boy about future matters, "Xiao Qi! Today, the teacher is seriously angry with you! You listen well; the teacher's voice is louder, so no crying... Alright, alright, it's true that being logical doesn’t depend on the volume... Is cold pig head meat that easy to eat? Is it that delicious?! If you can eat, that's great; if you can't, then just don’t! One cannot become a sage just to eat pig head meat! Being a gentleman, a head of the academy—what’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with having lofty aspirations?"

The phrase about eating cold pig head meat wasn’t originally coined by the old scholar, but he truly popularized it, causing many sages to occasionally poke fun at themselves and willingly mention it.

Is being a sage really that easy?

The old scholar once remarked that in Confucianism, it's easy for gentlemen to die, but hard for sages to perish. Yet, he only spoke half the truth; if sages find it difficult to die, does that mean they have it easier?

Why is it that the Confucian sages stationed in the heavens, those who are the pinnacle of knowledge, can exert Confucian powers, while those gentlemen and scholars from the seventy-two academies, who have no chance of turning a page of sage literature again, could still kill enemies and die in their prime?

So why, when faced with the massive invasions of the barbaric worlds, could the Confucian sages guarding the heavens only merge their fates with a continent’s earth?

This was the most they could do, these pitiful sages. Did Wan Yan Laojing, that old thief, know this? Of course, he did. But did he care? Not in the slightest.

Those who either slandered or harshly criticized the Central Plains Confucian Temple for being ineffective—did they know the fate of the gentlemen and scholars from the Three Continents’ academies? Did they care? Probably not. They demanded heroes while speaking of the victors and the vanquished.

Just like the "old friend" the sage mentioned, who was the sage that helped Du Mao go to Old Dragon City back in Tongyezhou. The old scholar cursed him, and would have fought if not for the Lesser Sage stopping him at the time.

And yet, even when there was no cold pig head meat to eat in the Central Plains Confucian Temple, that sage, having guarded the heavens year after year, still focused on honing his own scholarship, successfully bringing back the incense offerings of the Confucian Temple, insisting on returning to Tongyezhou and seeking death without a word, and that person even wanted to hurry.

That fellow’s true self, following the Ritual Sage to protect the righteous world, had already shattered and dispersed amidst the battles against the remnants of ancient deities.

Should the old scholar give that a thumbs up? He should.

In the Azure Sky World, a White Jade Capital was forged to suppress the demonic forces from outside. In the Lotus Flower World, the Western Buddhist Kingdom pressed down countless stubbornly malevolent spirits and fierce ghosts. 

As for the Righteous World, it seemed to be responsible for countering the invading demon races from the barbaric world, but it was far more than that.

As the most important enclave of the Righteous World, the Sword Qi Great Wall had tens of thousands of sword cultivators stationed there for thousands of years, holding the line against the demons from the barbaric lands. The Sword Qi Great Wall had stood for ten thousand years; did that mean the Confucian Temple could be worry-free for ten thousand years? Just sitting back and watching the show? Why did the second divine position of the Confucian Temple, the Ritual Sage, almost never appear? Even during the disputes of years past, he remained silent? No matter how many reasons there were, the biggest one was that the external threats were too great, and the distant worries were never truly distant.

All the accompanying sages stationed in the heavens were truly outside! They followed the Ritual Sage to confront the remnants of ancient deities! Only their shadow spirits remained in their hometown, half-alive, forced to guard the heavens and act as pathetic old gods!

Otherwise, would the ancient deities who have breached the heavens and come to visit the Righteous World over the past ten thousand years be simply dazed, obediently serving as gatekeepers for us?!

The old scholar remarked, "Just like you said, speaking fairly and addressing the matter—your friend, relying on moral essays, has genuinely benefited the world and has done quite well. Such words are not only to be said in your presence but also to my disciples in the same way."

The sage nodded. "The Sage of Literature speaks the truth, which resonates with me."

In fact, aside from the sage's principles, one of the deepest impressions the heavenly sage had of the old scholar was something he said long ago, not very much like the Sage of Literature.

Those who are not on my side are just bad people with rotten guts? Those who have a philosophical conflict with me are nothing but enemies with no redeeming qualities? Those scholars who diverge from my scholarly lineage are simply misguided readers?

Who the hell do I think I am?!

At that time, the old scholar was in the Confucian Temple, raising his voice. It seemed he was first speaking about himself, but in truth, he was also speaking about everyone.

The old scholar turned and earnestly asked, "Since you admire my knowledge and respect my character so much, why don't you become my disciple?"

The sage replied calmly, "I'm several hundred years older than the Sage of Literature. Besides, I believe you have some sense of the quality of our Ritual lineage's scholarship."

The old scholar rubbed his hands together. "You, you! Still too shy! I have a great relationship with your Ritual Sage; changing your affiliation will certainly be no problem. One might even say your vision is commendable. Even if the Ritual Sage doesn’t praise you, I will certainly praise you a few times on his behalf, truly taking in a student who has no biases whatsoever."

This sage did not respond.

The old scholar was well-known for his penchant for climbing the ladder of success, and he would even craft his own makeshift ladder if there wasn’t one.

Even when he faced the Ritual Sage or the Sage of Sages.

Even when he faced a rustic villager or a young student.

The old scholar lightly coughed a few times.

In a secluded area of the continent, where human traces were rare, those who had not yet been completely stripped of the righteous aura immediately experienced phenomena—clouds swirling or waters rising and falling.

As for Nanposao Zhou, with this sage by the old scholar’s side overseeing the earth’s fortune, even the slightest ripple was suppressed.

The old scholar grinned. "You’re troubled. I’m not a very good guest."

The sage shook his head. "In any case, I have no wine to entertain the Sage of Literature."

The old scholar asked, "You aren’t trying to chase me away, are you?"

The sage nodded with a smile. "What the Sage of Literature says is true."

The old scholar sighed. "Just sitting here waiting to die must be an unpleasant experience, right?"

The sage shook his head. "It’s slightly better than the Sage of Literature, without the pain and suffering."

The sages only left their shadow spirits to guard the heavens, responsible for stabilizing the earth’s fortune. This was not only the Confucian Temple's helpless choice but also a fortunate arrangement for the mortals, for since ancient times, the lonely sages, lacking true forms, became purer and aligned more closely with the heavenly Dao.

The old scholar stood up, grumbling as he walked away. He stumbled a bit and quickly disappeared.

After all, the righteous world’s Qi cultivators were all passionate and indignant, cursing these sages for being nothing but good people who only sent people to their deaths. The old scholar’s few words were nothing in comparison.

The sage sighed. That moment when Xiao Xuan drew his sword and faced off against the others; the old scholar didn’t just need a few drinks—were it an ordinary ascended cultivator, they would have long been enraged to the point of shaking the heavens to reclaim their fundamental Dao.

The sage looked down, and as the central hub of the scholarly world, the Chen Academy was once again in an uproar.

Currently, in the Central Plains Divine Continent, the various royal academies and schools, even among the scholars of the seventy-two academies, many were passionately speaking out, as if they were willing to sacrifice their identities as scholars to vehemently curse the sages for doing nothing, each one seeming confused as if they had never encountered even a single military text, allowing Tongye and Fuyou to watch helplessly as they fell. 

Does the Central Plains Divine Continent need to build a frontline? Can our great Central Plains even hold onto Tongye and Fuyou? As long as the sages of the Confucian Temple step forward, with ten from the Central Plains assisting, if ten aren’t enough, we’ll add another ten as reserves, along with the vast number of jade talismans and immortals to aid! Those beasts from the barbaric world, what fourteen thrones or whatever, would be easily shattered and turned to dust in the blink of an eye.

A young woman clad in a red cotton coat quietly sat at a gathering of scholars for a long time, listening intently. No matter whether their arguments were right or wrong, she chose to listen first before speaking.
After listening to those adamant words for a while, she felt the urge to ask a few questions. So, she found a scholar from the academy and inquired, “Are you planning to summon the Ascended and Immortal beings to come down from the mountains?”

“There are the Great Sage and the Virtuous Sage who will take charge of this matter.”

“What if they still refuse to come down? After all, battles can be deadly. The Ascended from Tongye Continent have already perished. Those cultivators on the mountain, I believe, are just as concerned for their lives as we are. After all, they climbed the mountain to pursue the Dao of Longevity.”

“I don’t even need to mention the Great Sage; just the rules laid down by the Virtuous Sage—who would dare to disobey? Who would even think to defy?”

“Yet some might dare to ignore them. Kill a few to establish authority? Then the rest would have no choice but to reluctantly follow them to the battlefield? Ultimately, as you said, they would all bravely march to their deaths in a foreign land. Isn’t it said that the great cultivators of our Haoran world are quite unfree? What if, in the end, they truly become free? For example, simply defecting to the Wildlands? Then they would have to fight both the Wildlands and prevent their own people from rebelling, wouldn’t that be quite taxing? The key issue is the people's hearts; the higher one is in position, the more one looks far and wide. Similarly, the actions of those who look far and wide will be more visible to those below. What then of the hearts of the people in the Central Land?”

“Hearts? In a world of chaos, what does that matter?! Those who undertake great matters are not concerned with trifles! As long as we win a great victory, the hearts of those on the mountain and those below will naturally be swayed.”

“Of course it matters! Because from the Ancestor of Tuoyue Mountain to Wenhai and Zhou Mi, to the entire Jiazi Camp, they have always been calculating the people's hearts. For instance, didn’t Zhou Mi say that when they land on the Central Land, the Wildlands will only dismantle the Confucian temples and academies, while leaving everything else untouched? Dynasties will remain, immortals will remain, everything will stay the same. The authority gained from relocating our Confucian temple will not be monopolized by Tuoyue Mountain; they are willing to sign contracts with the immortals and Ascended beings of the Central Land, planning to share a continent with all the major sects of the Central Land. The precondition is that the elders of the five realms atop the mountain do not interfere, only observing from the sidelines. As for the celestial masters beneath the five realms, even if they go to the battlefields of various continents to fight the demons, the Wildlands will not seek retribution afterward. Look, isn’t this all about the people's hearts?”

“Why are you rambling about these nonsensical things? Utterly pointless! Dare you speak of the noble spirit of scholars? I heard you are also a disciple of the Cliff Academy; truly, a person from a small place, lacking in knowledge and understanding. You have little sense of benevolence and righteousness in your heart.”

“Am I not just discussing the matter at hand with you?”

“Go away, go away! Do not make noise—a girl knows nothing.”

The scholar studying in the Central Land then moved on, continuing to speak passionately with his peers, full of vigor as he pointed out the injustices of the world.

If it were the cunning Tiger Xuanchan, he would probably have arrested all these people and sent them directly to the northern battlefield of the Golden Armored Continent using a few intercontinental ferries. Whether they genuinely sought death or merely craved fame, they could speak of it after they were dead.

Li Baoping, the refined scholar from the Chen family who had traveled alone from the Central Land, couldn’t help but sigh, taking out his gourd and secretly sipping some wine. 

Talking to people was truly exhausting. Regardless of whether I am right or wrong, can’t you at least listen to what I have to say? Just because I have a few valid points doesn’t mean you have to disagree with everything.

---

The old scholar ventured down to the mortal realm.

By chance, he caught sight of a figure in red, and his spirits lifted. He planned to chat with Chen Chuanan first before meeting with Little Baoping.

On a rocky cliff by the water, the scholar who had once single-handedly carried the sun and moon now bore the weight of an entire continent’s sun and moon. He didn’t even turn his head, saying, “Liu Cha has gone to Fuyiao Continent, and Xiao Xian is still on the way, blocking the sides.”

The old scholar lamented, “That little girl with the two braids is quite cute, but when it comes to action, she is truly unlikable.”

Chen Chuanan laughed and asked, “Do you really not hold a grudge against Xiao Xian’s actions at all?”

The old scholar replied, “After all, one must allow others to be human. As for other matters, let them be. If one makes a mistake, one must bear the consequences before talking about correcting it.”

Chen Chuanan said, “It’s difficult on all sides.”

The old scholar nodded, “Books and the world beyond are not the same; scholars find it difficult.”

Chen Chuanan raised an eyebrow and playfully commented, “Is the old scholar about to start cursing? If you’re going to curse, only blame the lineage of the Sage of Literature; remember to include the others of the literary lineage as well.”

The old scholar said, “The early pages of those old histories were painstakingly borrowed from the old man; do you want to hear them? Don’t think that you, nor even your mentor, knows them better than I do. You are someone who only likes reading the sage’s teachings and remains oblivious to worldly affairs. You don’t care for trivial matters, and our dear Virtuous Sage is so restrained that he seems to light an incense stick every time he turns a page. He might not feel weary, but I see it and find it exhausting.”

Chen Chuanan raised his hand, producing a flask of wine and offering it to the old scholar.

The old scholar shook the unusual flask, and the liquid inside seemed extraordinarily magical. He frowned and returned it to Chen Chuanan, saying, “This place has its own spiritual energy; you keep it to yourself. I don’t need even a drop of it.”

The old scholar continued, “Right now, I lack strength; you help me cover a bit. If there’s a slip-up and the heavenly secrets are leaked, it’ll be all your fault.”

Chen Chuanan promptly helped create a barrier between heaven and earth.

When it came to serious matters, the old scholar never hesitated.

He gazed out at the great river beyond the cliff, slowly recounting some ancient histories to Chen Chuanan.

Ten thousand years ago, humanity climbed mountains, reached the heavens, shattered the heavenly court, either killing or driving away those high and mighty beings who had treated humanity as mere pawns and manipulated their lives and deaths. From that moment on, those beings became mere wisps of smoke. In truth, when that moment arrived, nearly all of humanity found it hard to believe that they had really won. From then on, it seemed as if humanity would be responsible for maintaining peace for countless generations.

The demon race, which had existed even before humanity, had its own merits and grievances and still harbored deep animosity towards humanity. In the end, they claimed a quarter of the world, which would become known as the Wildlands. The vast expanse was rich in land but poor in resources and spiritual energy. After that, the sword cultivators who had rendered great service were relocated to what is now the Sword Qi Great Wall after a colossal internal upheaval. They built a high city, and three ancestors appeared one after another, ultimately combining their powers to help construct the Sword Qi Great Wall into a great formation that could disregard the seasons of the Wildlands, establishing their dominance and standing firm.

Chen Chuanan asked, “Those ancient sword cultivators, why did they choose to sever ties with all camps back then? I only know that if it weren’t for the internal division among sword cultivators at the time, it’s hard to say what the world would look like today.”

The old scholar sighed, “What else could it be? Sword cultivators are the most lethal force in the world, the ones who have slain the most divine beings. One faction of sword cultivators, headstrong and arrogant, believed that the ruins of the heavenly court, which even the sages shunned, should be sealed off. But that faction thought they should occupy it and promised they would slay all the remnants of the divine beings that had fled far away, sparing others any worry. Meanwhile, another faction led by Chen Qingdu, Longjun, and Guanzhao believed that this approach was unwise and that they should seek a larger territory in the mortal realm to recuperate. The result was a fierce battle that nearly turned the heavens and earth upside down.”

“Although the faction led by Chen Qingdu did not take action, there were the military ancestors who had long allied with the sword cultivators. Just a hair’s breadth away, they nearly held victory.”

Chen Chuanan inquired further, “During the bitter victory of humanity, did they not fear the remaining sword cultivators? What if something went wrong? Although Chen Qingdu and the others did not wield their swords at the time, the seeds of hatred were sown and would eventually grow into towering trees of sword energy. Sooner or later, if Chen Qingdu and Guanzhao were to have a change of heart or if the sword cultivators clashed with other factions of humanity, they would definitely draw their swords.”

“That’s right,” the old scholar replied with resignation. “So they became prisoners. How pitiful! Of course, it is extremely pitiful! But you must understand, at that time, the remaining sword cultivators might not even have been able to be called prisoners! Look at the sword cultivators of later generations at the Sword Qi Great Wall; did our Confucian Temple have any authority over them? At that time, a military ancestor who had lost his partner boldly proclaimed that these unruly fellows, with their temperaments akin to divine beings, would inevitably become a great trouble. The earlier sword cultivators didn’t want to obey, feeling their contributions were significant, and sought to occupy the ruins of the heavenly court. Very well, if they wanted to be the new divine beings, those remaining who changed their minds and gradually entered the battlefield to wield their swords were not few. If so, it would be better for both sides to be straightforward. At worst, they would fight for a few hundred years to see which side could be completely annihilated, leading to a more relaxed future, where peace could truly be established for thousands of years!”

Chen Chuanan began to understand.

The old scholar lightly waved his sleeve, “Be attentive. Some of this is what the old man directly said, and some is my own imagination. However, when combined, the truth shouldn’t be too far off.”

Chen Chuanan raised his gaze and noticed that figures from ancient times now emerged along the banks of the great river.

By the riverside, the figures seemed to be near yet distant, as if separated by the heavens.

An old sage stood by the water, as time flows ever onward, seemingly enlightened.

A dull-faced monk stood on the opposite bank, gazing toward this side.

A young Taoist priest sat by the water, washing his face with its flow, a green bull lying beside him. Then the young Taoist raised his head, as if sharing a subtle smile with the old scholar and Chen Chuanan from ten thousand years later.

A robust man clad in armor, gripping a knife in both hands, frowned silently, exuding a murderous aura, as he looked toward a young man nearby, who bore a sword on his back.

This was a gathering by the riverside.

Only the sword cultivator was present, named Chen Qingdu.

In addition, there were two ancient ancestors of the demon race participating in the discussion, one of whom would later become the master of Tuoyue Mountain, the great ancestor of the Wildlands. The other was Bai Ze.

Bai Ze stood beside a middle-aged man in a green robe, who was none other than the Virtuous Sage.

In the distance, several towering figures, ancient and immeasurable, appeared, but they were indistinct, even Chen Chuanan couldn’t clearly see their faces.

The furthest figure, the tallest of all, seemed to be tying up a mass of green hair.

The old scholar remarked, “The first thing Chen Qingdu uttered was so resolute it was as if he propped up the heavens with his spine. He simply said, ‘If we fight, then let’s fight!’”

It was as if the youth bearing the sword truly spoke those words beside the grand river of time.

The old scholar pointed to the imposing figure nearby, the robust man with a knife, who rubbed his chin with one hand, saying, “Very good.”

Further away, Bai Ze seemed about to speak, but was gently restrained by the Virtuous Sage, who shook his head to signal not to rush.

From the farthest point, the tall figure, though vague, spoke with a clear and cold voice, “I’ll help Chen Qingdu.”

The monk on the opposite bank shook his head.

The young Taoist sighed, “Can’t you see the true enemies of the Dao?”

Even from afar, witnessing a mural of time from ten thousand years ago, knowing the ultimate outcome, Chen Chuanan still felt a weight on his heart.

The old scholar chuckled, “Next, it should be our turn to take action, grand and magnificent; you think my heartfelt words are mere flattery? It cannot be!”

Chen Chuanan watched as the old sage, the Great Sage of the Haoran world, waved his hand and approached the youth with a sword, gently pressing down on the sword hilt while smiling, “I will take care of the sword cultivators. I vow that no matter how the sword cultivators choose in the future, in their battles, our Confucian lineage will bear all consequences and responsibilities.”

The monk on the opposite bank clasped his hands together, and the riverside Taoist lightly nodded.

Then the old sage withdrew his gaze and smiled at the sword-bearing youth, “Chen Qingdu, trust me. In the future, I will surely provide an explanation for the sword cultivators. I can’t guarantee it will be great, but I assure you it won’t be bad.”

“Chen Qingdu, if you don’t trust me, then it’s even less troublesome. Just feel free to draw your sword; I will protect the swords of the world’s sword cultivators for a while, as I’ve long grown accustomed to this matter.”

Suddenly, Chen Chuanan became serious. The refined scholar’s expression grew increasingly solemn and heavy as he bowed to the Great Sage from ten thousand years ago in a deep salute.

He reveres the truly sage-like figure in his heart.

From the farthest distance, that tall figure spoke nonchalantly, “It’s best if a fight breaks out; if not, I’ll come to your territory.”

The old scholar put away the mural of time.

Beyond the cliff, the great river no longer bore any figures.

This was the truth and reality.

Otherwise, who could define those sword cultivators, who were the most skilled in battle, as prisoners?! Because it was everyone outside of the sword cultivators! It wasn’t just humanity but even included those two ancient demon ancestors.

Moreover, it wasn’t entirely the sword cultivators’ fault.

The sword cultivators couldn’t restrain their swords, and a cultivator’s heart of the Dao could not be contained by Daoist techniques. No matter how many millennia passed, humanity would only remain a quagmire!

In the past, when the divine beings looked down from above, regarding all humanity as mere puppets, could humanity truly feel at ease? And then begin to slaughter one another?

At that time, the two leaders of the demon race who represented them in discussions had substantial disagreements regarding the wandering sword cultivators—one approved, while the other disapproved.

However, since they had been placed in the Wildlands, they said little more. Yet, the one who approved of turning the sword cultivators into prisoners absolutely did not anticipate that the stronghold of those prisoners would be situated between the Wildlands and the Haoran world.

After all, compared to the sword cultivators, who were their own kind, the enmity between the demon race and humanity was far more complex.

At that riverside, the two demon ancestors who participated in the discussions included the current master of Tuoyue Mountain and Bai Ze, who was later nominally suppressed at Xiongzhen Tower.

Why did so many remnants of ancient divine beings, who had quieted for ten thousand years, suddenly emerge all at once, all heading toward our Haoran world? Were they not going to attack Bai Yujing? Were they not heading to trample on Tuoyue Mountain in the Wildlands? It was because the Haoran world had accepted all the sword cultivators, and the two earliest scholars took up the burden to preserve the incense for the sword cultivators of the world! Otherwise, the Haoran world and the Wildlands could merely be two completely isolated realms; why would there be any need to have a Sword Qi Great Wall there, with people dying for ten thousand years? And why should the Haoran world and the Sword Qi Great Wall view each other with animosity?

Regardless, since the Confucianists dared to speak of this principle, they would have to pay the price and endure millennia of attacks from beyond the heavens!

All the saints residing in the celestial realm detached themselves from the Dao and ventured beyond, following the Virtuous Sage into battle, leaving only their shadow spirits in the Haoran homeland. By now, who among them wasn’t half-human, half-ghost? Wasn’t that the fate of the gentleman from Tongye Continent, Zhong Kui? That had long been the case!
The ancient remnants that managed to escape disaster were few in number. Aside from those once holding supreme positions, most either faded into nothingness or were forced to reincarnate as humans. But which of them was easy to provoke?

Why did Chen Qingdu choose to wield his sword and head to Tuo Moon Mountain? It was to repay a debt of gratitude. Why was he willing to defend the city for ten thousand years? It was to win a proper “explanation” for the sword cultivators from the Grand Master of the Sacred Teachings! Otherwise, in your eyes, isn’t Chen Qingdu just a useless, utterly useless waste?

Back then, at the riverside meeting, though he dared to draw his sword, he ultimately did not strike. He dared to die but never truly faced death. In the end, all the remaining sword cultivators also held back their swords, and humanity was spared another great catastrophe. In the end, the Sword Qi Great Wall was cleaved in two, yet not a single sword was drawn. The great sword immortal was even less capable than those teenage sword cultivators of the lower ranks?

The old scholar sat on the stone cliff, glanced at the sky, and then spoke softly, “I once asked the old man why the sages acted this way, making such great sacrifices while remaining silent, not uttering a word. It seemed like the Confucian Temple was purposely concealing something. Only those upright gentlemen among the candidates for sagehood would know a little of the inside story, allowing them to make an early choice about whether to become that non-human, non-ghost type of existence. I was truly anxious back then, so I asked the old man why we couldn’t just explain our hardships to the world, speak about the difficulties of governance. A heartfelt lecture on principles, after all. Who knows if they’d listen or remember? At the very least, we should try. Worst case, it would let that white-eyed wolf realize it’s a white-eyed wolf.”

“You know how the old man answered me? He held up three fingers—not three phrases—just three words.”

“‘On what basis?’”

Chen Chunan asked, confused, “What does the Grand Master of the Sacred Teachings mean by those three words?”

Was it a reprimand or a demand directed at all the sages? Or perhaps a reflection on the Dao of the world for millennia… was there a tinge of disappointment? Or was there some other deep meaning?

The old scholar sighed, “You know I’m quite good at reading people, but back then, the old man had a poker face, not a hint of anything. I couldn’t guess the answer.”

Chen Chunan replied, “The sages seem willing to grant humanity more freedom, which is precisely what Jia Sheng despises the most. He seeks to separate heaven and earth, placing the finest cultivators in the heavens while everyone else stays on the ground. Compared to the previous grand world of righteousness, the strong gain the most freedom, while the weak are left with none. And the strong, in Jia Sheng’s eyes, are not even related to character.”

The old scholar stood on his tiptoes and patted Chen Chunan’s shoulder, “You’ve had it tough, being stabbed in the back, almost reaching my former glory. Good, good. We’re in the same boat, brothers. It’s no wonder we can chat so well.”

The cultivators from the Central Divine Continent, closely tied to the islands of Tongye, Fuyou, and Jinjia, along with the major dynasties and noble families, were all fixated on the battlefield of Nan Posuo, ultimately watching only Chen Chunan.

Those who sought to reason were bottling it all up, some already starting to speak openly about it.

The old scholar whispered, “Die, die, die! Why aren't they coming to Nan Posuo to die? Why aren’t they going to Jinjia to die? Why didn’t the scholars die at the Sword Qi Great Wall back then? Why aren’t they dying in Tongye? Or Fuyou? In the future, why won’t ten people from the Central Divine Continent die? Why won’t ten from the grand world of righteousness die? Why doesn’t the vice head of the Confucian Temple die? Why don’t the sages die? And on top of that, why doesn’t Chen Chunan die outside Nan Posuo?”

The old scholar sighed, “Many sages have already died.”

His frustration grew, “At least give Chen Chunan a chance to die with dignity! You all are worse than that damned A Liang, a hundred times worse!”

“When the mountains and rivers of Nan Posuo are destroyed, oh, they’ll shut up, or maybe they won’t—there will be even more talk. They’ll first call Chen Chunan a useless piece of trash, refusing to die early, clinging to life. If he dies, he’ll still have some heroic spirit left. Then they’ll call him a sinner of the grand world of righteousness, deserving to die, dying well. If not, he’ll only feel ashamed before the lineage of the quasi-sages and the Confucian Temple of the Central Divine Continent.”

Chen Chunan seemed to have anticipated this, showing no signs of disappointment, only smiling as he said, “In our lineage of quasi-sages, the Confucian Temple has the most accompanying sages.”

Indeed, among the Confucian traditions of the grand world of righteousness, the lineage of quasi-sages was the most prosperous.

The old scholar replied, “So you all die more, carrying a heavier burden. That’s why I don’t hold it against you for some things.”

The old scholar had one good trait: he acknowledged goodness, whether it was a good principle or good deeds from good-hearted people. Right and wrong were calculated separately.

The people who couldn’t tolerate even the slightest grievance were those who only picked the good to see, only chose the favorable to hear, and only selected the profitable to learn.

Whether it was Jia Sheng of the grand world of righteousness or Zhou Mi of the wild world, they were not entirely wrong in saying that the Confucian Temple had indeed been too lenient, allowing too much leeway.

Many scholars of the quasi-sage lineage today were quite principled, willing to criticize mistakes, even if it was their own pillar, the pure Confucian Chen Chunan—he too would be criticized and deemed worthy of it.

Chen Chunan didn’t mind at all; instead, he sincerely comforted many, laughing, “Those who can think this way and dare to say it openly are actually quite good. After all, they aim for the grand world of righteousness. Once they read more and broaden their horizons, things will surely change. I’ve always believed that the younger generation these past few years has improved with more reading and wider experiences. I firmly believe in this. Just look back at that Wanyan Laojing; aside from his high cultivation, what else can he compare to? As for that Mr. Nalan in the Central Divine Continent, his sect is in an awkward position due to his background and the prevalence of demon cultivators. He’s not better off than I am; he endures the same. So, when you say the old must be mad and the young must be stable, it’s not entirely correct.”

“The same principle applies; it’s about people, places, and timing. You’ve mixed up your reasoning.”

The old scholar chuckled angrily, “If it weren’t for a group of virtuous gentlemen putting in the effort to explain things properly, almost because of the death of a perfectly timed demon pawn, we would have clashed violently with the cultivators on the mountain.”

Chen Chunan suddenly said, “There are simply too few old scholars in the world. Otherwise, things would indeed be much better.”

Only the old scholar could summon Bai Ye to open the Fifth World.

He could even convince Bai Ze, who “wouldn’t help either side,” to actively present a treasure map of his ancestors to Nan Posuo.

Chen Chunan rarely praised the old scholar, but unexpectedly, the old scholar was ungrateful, stamping his foot, “Why should I?! Why should Zhou Shenzhi go to Fuyou’s Water Cave? Why should Fu Lu Yu Xuan risk leaving the Central Divine Continent? Why should Zheng Juzhong of the White Emperor City go to Baoping Island to take on disciples, ‘passing by’ Luoshui Pit? Why should Huai Lao squeeze his nose and bring people to Nan Posuo to lose money?! Why should the only son of the quasi-sage lie under Tuo Moon Mountain? Why should my disciples wield their swords against their own teacher, even trying to save Bai Ye?! Why should Lu Zhi chase after Liu Cha without a second thought? Why should the Dragon Slayer not slay dragons upon reaching Lihuzhu Cave?! Why should the real Fire Dragon guard the Long Bridge over the sea? Why should the Daoist of the Observation of the Dao offer up a life-bound iron ring? Why should the old monk of the Chicken Soup actively enter the fray? Why should Bai Ye travel far with a sword, thinking he’s finally proud of himself?!”

The old scholar sighed, “The common people can indeed question their own conscience. The affairs of the mountain and the sky have always been unknown. We can’t demand anything from them.”

But he then asked, “What about those cultivators with enough vision? What about those who see everything yet choose to ignore it?”

Chen Chunan replied, “That’s the freedom we Confucians grant. If we choose to do so, then we must bear the consequences without complaint.”

The demon clan of the wild world is like a starving person barging into a wealthy household, intending to eat their fill and survive. If they lag behind, they’ll be killed by the greater demons behind them. If they’re afraid of death on the battlefield, their entire clan will perish.

Would the Confucian sages of the Central Divine Continent act this way? Would they dare? Would they be willing? Would they be capable? Is it appropriate?

Only Baoping Island is truly willing, daring to compete with the wild world in ruthlessness, in meticulousness, in calculating the hearts of others. They place certain sage principles temporarily aside, storing them in books.

How many cultivators atop the mountain heard the words of the great ancestor of Tuo Moon Mountain, and how many actually grasped their true meaning? Certainly, it’s not just Wanyan Laojing, who betrayed Jinjia.

The old scholar stomped his foot in fury, “I will definitely have complaints! I can’t bear to curse the commoners even once, but some of those mountain-top great cultivators, especially certain bastards among the Confucian lineage who are better at scheming than Huai Lao, have water in their brains! One by one, I’ll spit in their faces!”

“I have to admit one thing: cultivators are indeed a different breed. There are good and bad among them.”

Chen Chunan remained silent for a long time before saying, “The nature of humanity is inherently evil.”

Upon hearing this, the old scholar felt no joy; instead, he said, “The essence of the heart is divided; the human heart tends towards goodness. Today’s youth are vastly different; the future holds great hope.”

In the end, Chen Chunan smiled, “Now, the lineage of the Sage is booming with students, while my quasi-sage lineage is being criticized because of me. Are you secretly pleased?”

The old scholar patted Chen Chunan’s sleeve, “I’m not that kind of person. One mustn’t judge a scholar’s heart by the heart of a sage.”

The old scholar couldn’t help but chuckle, “Look at that, secretly pleased? Not at all.”

In a flash, the old scholar disappeared, heading to find Little Baoping.

As Chen Chunan was about to ask, the old scholar's hoarse voice echoed in his heart, “Just wait and see.”

In what seemed like an empty Central Divine Temple, ripples began to stir.

On the plaza of the temple, it was already in disarray.

Meanwhile, near the Jiaolong Ditch, a gray-clad elder stood, and a massive whirlpool had emerged beneath his feet.

Atop the Sui Mountain of the Central Divine Continent, a sturdy figure clad in golden armor clasped his fists, “I pay my respects to the Grand Master of the Sacred Teachings.”

An old Confucian scholar in a robe smiled, “Sui Mountain is the highest in the world; I temporarily borrow a piece of land from you. Apologies for the disturbance. Remember to send all living beings to the Prince’s Mountain; there may be significant commotion later.”

The golden armored deity continued to clasp his fists, saying solemnly, “Your humble abode shines brightly.”

The old scholar sighed, “Did you learn that from that scholar?”

The golden armored deity chuckled, no longer interrupting the Grand Master of the Sacred Teachings and others' affairs, and directly headed for the foot of Sui Mountain.

The old scholar sat cross-legged, took out a book from his sleeve, and spoke to the heavens with a heartfelt voice, “It’s been too long since you fought. My apologies.”

As the elder revealed the book, the shoulders of the golden armored deity sank, and even the entire Sui Mountain instantly sank several feet.

In the realm beyond the grand world of righteousness.

A middle-aged scholar in a blue robe, commanding the heavens and the earth, held his hands in a ghostly grip, using only his own strength and courtesy to shield the entire grand world of righteousness in his palms.

There, accompanying sages from the Confucian Temple, who traveled far and wide, were engaged in a fierce battle against ancient remnants of divine beings.

For millennia, the situation beyond the heavens had never been as perilous.

A deity, majestic as the sage of ritual, stood far away, appearing as small as a mustard seed, and once again unleashed a sword strike.

Beside him, an ancient giant deity, who had been present for millennia, casually grasped a star, instantly refining it into a thunder pool, and smashed it hard against the golden body of a vice head of the Confucian Temple.

When the old scholar, stationed in the grand world of righteousness, opened the first page of the book.

The entire mountain trembled at its base, crashing down even further.

Only I, the grand world of righteousness, have Bai Ye. Moreover, he is a scholar.

Atop Sui Mountain, the old scholar glanced at a certain place in the Central Divine Continent, where the Li tree was in full bloom.

Finally, the old scholar gazed into the distance.

Do you really think I, the old man, won’t fight?! 

(End of this chapter)

 **Chapter 847: Fishing in Dried Ponds**

Li Baoping led her horse past one archway after another, heading toward the riverbank.

The esteemed Chen clan, celebrated as the pinnacle of archway craftsmanship, was home to both Shaoguang Academy and Fanlu Academy—two of the seventy-two Confucian academies, and among the most renowned institutions in Haoran. Fanlu Academy, in particular, was almost a family legacy of the Chen clan, with most of the esteemed scholars there sharing the surname Chen.

Wearing a crimson dress and a small wine gourd at her waist, Li Baoping was quite well-known in these two academies, thanks in part to her stubborn adherence to principles and her extraordinary patience during debates. While not universally adored, she certainly managed to annoy a fair number of people. Thus, the scholars of Shaoguang and Fanlu academies recognized this young woman from Shanyan Academy. Although Shanyan Academy, under the significant influence of the newly appointed headmaster Cui Zhan, had garnered some fame, it was primarily due to Cui’s controversial reputation for betraying his mentors and ancestors, rather than the merits of the students it produced or the notable achievements of its young scholars. As such, the Confucians had their reservations about Shanyan Academy's reinstatement among the seventy-two.

Cui Zhan, the “Embroidered Tiger,” had been the Grand Master of the great Lihua Kingdom, capable of uniting the power of a continent to counter the demonic forces. That was indisputable; however, his appointment as headmaster of the academy had drawn considerable criticism.

Li Baoping had previously traveled alone across the Central Divine Continent, visiting the major dynasties of Dadu and Shaoyuan, all of which were in a state of emergency, drafting top cultivators and elite troops to the main coastal battle lines against the demonic tide. Various schools of thought had sent their Qi practitioners, each displaying their unique powers, with mountain ferries rising into the sky in droves, casting shadows across the cities and plunging them into sudden darkness. It was said that the ancestors of many schools had come forth, yet the figures of the revered sages from the Confucian Temple—the Most Sacred Teacher, the Rites Sage, the Second Sage, and other founders of the Confucian lineage—had yet to appear. In the end, only a deputy teacher and three grand lecturers were seen bustling about across the continents, often reported in the news from the mountainous residences, meeting with various people and discussing various matters.

In truth, Li Baoping was not entirely alone in her travels. A young Qi practitioner named Xu Bai preferred to follow her from a distance, though this young man, often referred to as "Xu Xian," had become wise after being transported thousands of miles by Li Xisheng twice. He only occasionally boarded the same ferry as her, making sure to keep his distance and not seek her out once on board. He simply stood at the bow, staring longingly at the crimson-dressed girl, content with just a distant glance.

Previously, while taking a ferry to Nanposha Continent, Li Baoping could no longer hold back and approached him, asking, “Xu Bai, are you bound by a red thread? What is it you like about me? What would it take for you to not like me?”

Xu Bai’s face flushed instantly, and he hurriedly answered all three questions, insisting he was absolutely not bound by a red thread and that he liked everything—unless he happened to like another girl.

In this world of cultivators, there were indeed those with heavenly blessings, like Huang Ting of Tongye Continent and He Xiaoliang of Baoping Continent.

Now, among the ten young elites, there was a young sword cultivator named Liu Cai, who monopolized two Dao ancestor gourds, and another who had ascended in the realm of humanity, already making waves in the world.

Among the ten young candidates, Xu Bai from the Central Divine Continent and Ma Kuxuan from Baoping Continent were particularly favored by fortune, akin to serendipitous opportunities falling from the sky.

Both the young elites and the candidates had undergone various trials of the Dao, and even the youngest, the girl "Chunqing" from the Bamboo Sea Cave Heaven, had already endured several battles at the tender age of sixteen, being the only direct descendant of the Lady of Qing Shen Mountain. Xu Bai, however, was different from Ma Kuxuan; he had no record of taking action, only having had two encounters that could be termed “conflicts,” both of which resulted in such good fortune that he considered himself unlucky. He had the misfortune of encountering Li Baoping's elder brother, but fortunately, Xu Bai was devoid of any competitive spirit and remained unbothered by his two defeats, simply wishing to avoid meeting that scholarly man again.

Currently, Xu Bai found himself at Fanlu Academy, with only one lingering question in his heart: who exactly was Li Baoping’s so-called “little master uncle”? Why had she confidently declared that once she met her little master uncle, she would make Xu Xian become Xu Buxian? At that moment, the crimson-dressed girl seemed to transform into an adorable little girl in his eyes. Xu Bai mused that even if he had to take a beating from that little master uncle, it would still be worth it.

As for the nickname “Xu Xian,” which had been inexplicably bestowed upon him, Xu Bai had always felt uneasy about it and dared not take it seriously.

After all, the poetry of the White Immortal and the sword of the Su Immortal, the words of the Immortal of Symbols, and the chess of the Zheng Immortal were all truly ethereal, unparalleled in the world, and Xu Bai could not comprehend how he had ended up with a suffix of “Immortal.”

As Li Baoping walked by the riverbank, about to take up her sword-shaped gourd for a drink, she quickly put it down.

Li Baoping blinked, her teacher’s teacher had arrived.

The old scholar, still employing his illusionary arts, chuckled softly, “Little Baoping, don’t make a fuss. My name is quite known here; if I’m discovered, it will be hard to escape.”

Recalling the past, how many young women had lost their hairpins and handkerchiefs due to the allure of the Chen clan’s teachings? How many scholars had argued red-faced over a mere seat?

Li Baoping refrained from bowing and greeting him, instead calling out to her master in her heart for the first time.

The old scholar grinned broadly, quite fond of this aspect of her, unlike that Ma Xiaodong, who was more formal than the teacher himself.

The old scholar casually asked, “Little Baoping, what book are you reading lately?”

Li Baoping replied, “I’m reading a Buddhist scripture, which starts with the Great Wisdom Bodhisattva asking the Buddha one hundred and eight questions.”

Had it been any other Confucian discourse, the old sage would have likely suffered a headache upon hearing this; however, the old scholar chuckled knowingly. “You’ve chosen a fine book, Little Baoping. It’s a good scripture with profound Buddhist teachings. The Buddha felt that one hundred and eight questions were still too few, leading to more questions, almost exhausting the heavens and earth. One of the Buddha’s intentions was to eliminate the relative law, which actually shares a remarkable similarity with our Confucian principle of the Doctrine of the Mean. The scholar who resonates with this the most among us is probably that wise man from Shujian Lake whom your little master uncle has interacted with. I once arranged a course for your teacher and several of your elders specifically to respond to ‘Heavenly Questions.’ Later, your left elder teacher deliberately used this to challenge your little master uncle at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Li Baoping nodded gently. Over the years, she had dabbled in Buddhist philosophy due to its emphasis on clarity, and the teachings of her lineage’s ancestors, particularly this venerable sage beside her, had also elaborated on the importance of naming to signify reality in the “Discourse on Rectification of Names.” Naturally, she delved deeper into exploring more. In short, these were all tools for “debate,” and the more, the better. However, the more books Li Baoping read, the more questions she had, and ironically, she found herself unable to win debates against herself. Thus, she seemed increasingly silent, but in truth, she was engaged in an internal dialogue, questioning and answering herself too often.

“The sage’s teachings can lead to enlightenment naturally.”

The old scholar sighed, “Such words were difficult for your teacher to share with you before; you were too young then, and your studies were not deep enough, easily distracted. For example, ‘Sweeping and cleaning should maintain inner and outer cleanliness; locking doors and gates must be personally checked.’ Such words might seem tedious to a child, yet to an elder, it becomes profound wisdom, realizing that the essence of knowledge is in daily life. The same person, the same principle, experiences a starkly different feeling at a young age compared to an older age. Once one’s studies deepen, one can weave texts together and discern meaning from the words.”

As he spoke, the old scholar took out a jade bracelet from his sleeve, placing it in his palm, and asked with a smile, “Do you see anything in this?”

Li Baoping appeared to grasp something and nodded, “It’s similar to the most precious square seal among the seals down the mountain; it’s the same principle—what exists and what does not are uncertain, yet the essence is boundless.”

A beautiful piece of sheep-fat jade, carved into a bracelet, was precious and rare precisely because it required discarding much to leave a refined taste for appreciation.

In contrast, the value of elliptical seals and shape seals was far inferior to that of square seals, owing to the principle of “not letting go.”

Yet, this also touched upon a layer of significance linked to the “immortal seed” connected to the material of the bracelet and square seal. However, Little Baoping’s thoughts leaped far beyond, sparing the old scholar much worry.

Suddenly, the old scholar turned his head and smilingly asked, “Xu Bai, what do you think?”

From a distance behind them, a young man quickly stepped forward, first bowing in apology, then rising to bow again, answering respectfully, “I—I do not know.”

Xu Bai, hailing from a remote small kingdom in the Central Divine Continent, originally from Zhaoling, came from a long line of mundane scholars who guarded the Wish Bridge. Although he had diligently studied the sacred texts since a young age, he still struggled with practical matters. This time, he had mustered the courage to travel alone, and along the way, had encountered several amusing blunders.

The old scholar gazed at the young man in the blue robe and scarf. Thankfully, this lad was not yet a Confucian scholar, but rather honest and straightforward. Otherwise, if he dared to undermine the lineage of the sage, the old scholar would have had to express his anger with words. The greatest principle of the universe trumped all, and as for age and status, they could be set aside. The old scholar was in a good mood, thinking, “Good lad, worthy of the title Xu Xian—such a love-struck guy. My lineage’s direct and indirect heirs are certainly not lacking good fortunes; it’s just that they have focused entirely on their studies, while the Rites Sage’s lineage and the Second Sage’s lineage are on a different level. As for the lineage of that old fellow Fu, it’s even worse, being closer to the humblest scholars seeking guidance.”

Li Baoping sighed softly, realizing she had no choice but to call her elder brother for assistance. If her brother could manage it, he would simply send Xu Bai back to his homeland.

The old scholar quickly raised his hand, gesturing for Little Baoping not to rush into using her trump card; with her master present, there was nothing to fear.

The old scholar waved at Xu Bai. When the young man nervously approached the old scholar, he performed another bow and said, “I am Xu Bai, paying my respects to the Venerable Sage.”

The old scholar nodded, smiling, and asked, “Xu Bai, have you heard of a rigorously scholarly old master named Ma Xiaodong, renowned throughout the land?”

Xu Bai nodded, “In my youth, my learning teacher provided me with a reading list before embarking on his journeys, outlining sixteen books for me to read repeatedly. One of those was the interpretative work of Headmaster Ma from Shanyan Academy. I studied it earnestly and gained much.”

At this point, Xu Bai felt somewhat embarrassed, aware that his learning teacher, while esteemed, was incomparable to an academy headmaster. After all, the young man from a small place had a humble heart, and the difference between wealth and poverty, the mountain top and the valley, still weighed upon him. Thus, in Xu Bai’s eyes, no matter how much he respected his teacher, he believed that the knowledge of an academy sage far surpassed that of a mere village master.

The old scholar chuckled, refraining from revealing any profound secrets to the young man, and merely communicated with Little Baoping in thought, “If I’m not mistaken, Xu Bai’s learning teacher is the ‘Lord Xu of Zhaoling,’ an undeniable great scholar. However, despite both being surnamed Xu, there’s no genealogical connection between them.”

Li Baoping understood in her heart.

The one known among the people as the “Saint of Characters” was not one of the revered sages enshrined in the Confucian Temple, but he was indeed an old master whom her little master uncle had greatly admired in the past.

The old scholar laughed, “Your learning teacher has quite the discerning eye, selecting these sixteen classics for you to delve into. Among them is Ma Xiaodong’s ‘Cui Zizi Collection,’ which reveals not only Cui Zhan’s foundational knowledge but also Ma Xiaodong’s annotations, allowing you to see both the principles and the techniques involved.”

It was hard to imagine that a disciple of a scholar specializing in writing commentaries would clash so fiercely with his senior brother, Ma Xiaodong, at Shanyan Academy.

The old scholar inquired, “Earlier, Little Baoping mentioned that scripture; I’ve heard you have quite a diverse reading list. Have you come across it?”

Xu Bai nodded, “I’ve read it, but I’ve read a lot and thought little. I remember it but cannot comprehend it.”

The old scholar casually remarked, “To decide to become a Buddha is like dust rising in the wind; what danger is there?”

Xu Bai replied without hesitation, “Once one begins cultivation, it’s like a leaf floating back to the sea, without any hesitation.”

The old scholar nodded, “Upon your return to the Central Divine Continent, you should visit the Liji Academy and ask Ma Xiaodong about your questions regarding the ‘Collection.’ Young man, it’s not easy to travel far, so you shouldn’t just enjoy the scenery.”

Xu Bai’s face turned slightly red, and he nodded vigorously.

The old scholar then communicated in thought to Xu Bai, “My Little Baoping, as long as you’re not blind, will surely like you. It would be strange if she didn’t like you. However, given the current turmoil in the world, young people should focus on cultivation and stability. Love is beautiful, but there’s no need to rush. Since you have no ties to any lineage yet, take your time—if you go to the Liji Academy, learn whatever you find appealing, and choose to study under the scholars whose knowledge resonates with you most. There’s no need to be restricted by lineage; you can decide who to follow as a true disciple when you meet your learning teacher again.”

Xu Bai hesitated for a moment and asked, “Venerable Sage, is my learning teacher truly the legendary ‘Lord Xu’?”

When he was learning in his early years, his teacher favored explaining meanings through characters and words, and before embarking on his journey, he had recommended various books, particularly favoring interpretative works.

However, if the Venerable Sage hadn’t mentioned it today, Xu Bai would never have dared to associate his humble village teacher with the esteemed “Lord Xu.”

The old scholar felt a bit helpless, thinking, “Why are young people so hard to fool these days? They’re all so sharp; it’s really not as simple as my apprentices, who are still pure of heart.” 

Yet, since Xu Bai had guessed it himself, the old scholar couldn’t fabricate anything, especially considering the importance of the matter. Even if some words might be disheartening, he had to be direct about it. Originally, the old scholar planned to find someone to secretly assist Xu Bai in seeking refuge at a certain academy in the Central Divine Continent. Although Xu Bai had great potential, the world was perilous and full of uncertainties. He lacked the experience, and regardless of whether he was from his lineage or not, it was best to ensure he was protected.

Especially concerning that “Lord Xu,” due to the connection between his scholarly achievements and the name of the Confucian sage, he had become a target for the major demon lords of the wild lands. While the old scholar could protect himself, it wouldn’t be pleasant if unexpected troubles arose because of an unnamed disciple like Xu Bai.

Therefore, the old scholar nodded, “Indeed, it is the ‘One Who Explains Characters and Words, the Best in the World’ Lord Xu. Thus, you must be cautious; the demon lords of the wild lands, especially the great demon of Tuoyue Mountain, may very well take action against you. Sooner or later, they will seek trouble with your teacher. My earlier suggestion for you to visit the Liji Academy was not just for your studies; the demon tribes are scheming, both openly and covertly, with no regard for civility. It’s possible there’s a plot specifically targeting Xu Bai, and subsequently, targeting Lord Xu. You may feel worried and need to think about it more, but there’s no need to be overly frightened. I, along with your teacher, who has yet to reveal his identity for whatever reason, and Chen Chunan, we old friends are still here.” 

Xu Bai bowed in gratitude.

Xu Bai had always preferred not to approach the great Confucian sages as one of the ten young candidates but rather hoped to engage with them humbly as a disciple of Confucianism, seeking knowledge. The former felt too abstract, while the latter felt far more grounded. Up to today, he still found it hard to believe he was among the elite; however, he never felt he didn’t deserve the identity of a scholar. His greatest hope in life was to attain a degree through the imperial examination and become a civil servant capable of benefiting his community. As for mastering minor techniques, encountering various calamities in the future would mean he wouldn’t have to pray for rain or relief at the Confucian Temple or Dragon King Shrine, nor would he need to implore immortals to descend and manage floods. That wouldn’t be a bad thing.
The old scholar stroked his beard and chuckled, “You must have a good rapport with that Mao Xiaodong. Once you arrive at the Liji Academy, be a bit thick-skinned and just go on about how you and the old scholar were like brothers, how you met as if you were old friends after a long separation. Feel embarrassed? When it comes to learning, as long as your heart is sincere, there’s nothing to be ashamed of. If you truly manage to grasp all of Mao Xiaodong’s knowledge, that would be the best apology. When I first traveled to the Confucian Temple, how did I enter? I boldly claimed to have received the true teachings of the Sage, who would dare to stop me? With the wind at my feet, I rushed in, quickly offering incense and bowing to the old man’s statue. Didn’t the Sage just chuckle at that?”

Xu Bai felt increasingly awkward; after all, he was a scholar accustomed to propriety. If it weren’t for the presence of Li Baoping, rumored to be from the Pearl Cave Heaven, he might have thought he was facing a false Confucian sage.

As Xu Bai prepared to take his leave, the old scholar nodded with a smile. Xu Bai didn’t move, and Li Baoping shot him a glance, silently urging him not to overstay his welcome. After a long moment of hesitation, Xu Bai mustered his courage, met her gaze, and softly said, “Li Baoping, if I’ve been bothersome, I sincerely apologize.”

Li Baoping remained silent, her expressive eyes clearly conveying, “Then why don’t you change that?” 

Xu Bai broke into a radiant smile and clasped his fists in farewell. Li Baoping sighed, reluctantly returning the gesture.

After Xu Bai left, the old scholar joked, “Little Baoping, you really don’t need to fret. It’s not easy for a young man like Xu Xian to take a liking to you.”

Li Baoping shook her head. “I know Xu Bai is a fine scholar, but some things can’t be forced.”

The old scholar chuckled. “Little Baoping, go ahead and explore. I need to have a few words with an old acquaintance.”

Li Baoping bowed in farewell to her mentor, sharing many unspoken sentiments in her gaze. The old scholar, of course, noticed and accepted them, handing a white jade bracelet to Baoping. 

Li Baoping accepted it without hesitation, putting it on her wrist as she continued her journey with her horse.

The old scholar smiled, feeling fortunate to enjoy his later years. Among the disciples of the Confucian lineage, Li Baoping was the most “accomplished,” already exhibiting the demeanor of a female sage. As for any potential troubles ahead, the old scholar felt assured: “I have a direct disciple to protect the Dao.”

Lin Shouyi had gathered the three volumes of “The Book of Glorious Clouds” through chance, talent, and sincerity, gradually ascending in his cultivation, yet he still maintained his identity as a Confucian scholar. 

Li Huai, while not considered a gifted scholar by many Qi practitioners, was still regarded as a promising seedling in the Confucian lineage. Having read the classic texts and grasped a few essential principles, he was persistent in his practice. If that wasn’t a promising seed, then what could be?

Dong Shuijing had become a dealer in blades, embodying the principle that a gentleman loves wealth but acquires it through righteous means. What teacher wouldn’t appreciate such a disciple?

Yu Lu and Xie Xie were both doing well too. One was broadening his horizons, while the other was growing in generosity, providing some reassurance to the countless remnants of the Lu Dynasty. The world is filled with various knots, seemingly tightened by the passage of time, but in truth, they can be untangled. For instance, the impoverished families of Hongzhu Town, or the unfortunate prisoners of the Lu family, could indeed find relief. There are many withered trees along the paths of life, but when spring arrives, who knows? Even old trees may blossom with beauty.

That young girl, Shi Chunja, had already married, and her little child would soon become a young lad in a few years.

Zhao Yao had made achievements in both the arts and techniques, having ventured to the Fifth World. Although he still struggled with his obsession over the Spring Character Seal, as a young person, the more he grappled with a couple of matters, the greater his future prospects would be. Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to read extensively, and not become a mere walking bookshelf.

An old man suddenly materialized beside the old scholar, smiling as he said, “What a fine saying: ‘Reading the classics naturally leads to enlightenment.’” 

With that one sentence, he encompassed the teachings of the Three Doctrines, with Confucianism leading the way.

The old scholar replied, “Just so-so. If you want such fine words, I have a basketful; feel free to take them.”

The newcomer was none other than Xu Bai’s teacher, Xu Jun from Shaoling. Xu Jun remained silent. Those familiar with the old scholar's ways often learned a form of silent meditation on the side.

The old scholar spoke seriously, “It’s indeed difficult for someone to hide their name for so many years here.”

Six beasts were surrounding a lone figure, and talismans were necessary to save Bai. 

Xiao Xian was intercepting from the left and right, while Lu Zhi was chasing after Liu Cha.

The world was in chaos, but that was the extent of it.

The real turmoil lay among the people beneath the mountains of the Three Continents.

Xu Jun nodded, “If it weren’t for the barbaric world breaking through the Sword Qi Great Wall, those ascended monsters would be acting too cautiously. Otherwise, I could have ‘taken a city first.’ With that mountain search map you stole, the odds would have increased. I can’t say I could kill those fourteen thrones and make them wary, but I could manage something. Unfortunately, those who come here to act are either Liu Cha or Xiao Xian; that Jia Sheng should have guessed I was here long ago.”

The so-called “taking a city first” referred to wielding the true name inscribed on the mountain search map, allowing Xu Jun to use his innate divine powers to “interpret the texts” for the world of Haoran, slaying a head of a great demon. The cost of killing transcended beings would not be small for Xu Jun, even with the ancestral map in hand. Even if he risked his life’s essence, destroying two pages of the mountain search map would still only allow him to slay two ascended beings outside the thrones.

However, since he had been in this place for some time, Xu Jun had no intention of returning to his hometown of Shaoling in the Central Continent. This was also the reason why he hadn’t accepted Xu Bai as his direct disciple earlier.

But there was a crucial premise: both sides needed to be within the Haoran world; after all, Xu Jun of Shaoling was not Bai Ze.

Thus, Xu Jun could only stubbornly wait for an ascended great demon to step onto Nanposao Continent. With Chen Chunan stationed in the mountains and rivers of the continent, assisting to suppress the great demon would reduce Xu Jun's consumption of his Dao.

Though it seemed there were no battles to be fought in Nanposao, the Central Continent Academy and mountains had already been thoroughly criticized. However, maintaining a firm hold on Nanposao itself meant that the barbaric world would have to stretch two long fronts.

As for whether to go to Tongye Continent or Fuyou Continent, this scholar who did not accompany the Confucian Temple might not even have time to reveal the great demon’s true name before being targeted by the meticulous Wenhai or even the great ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain.

Even if the Sage intervened to save him, the loss would still outweigh the gains.

In truth, the Sage and the old man in gray near the Jiaolong Ditch were the first to engage in combat, with the ruins in front of the Confucian Temple and the whirlpool in the Jiaolong Ditch serving as undeniable evidence.

That represented a true conflict of the Dao between two worlds.

And someone who recklessly smashed jars and bottles would always have it easier than someone trying to protect every single vessel.

As for Xu Jun’s claim of stealing the mountain search map, the old scholar chose to ignore it.

The South Posao Continent beneath their feet was well-guarded by the righteous Chen Chunan, as well as the Sword Suppressing Tower, one of the nine towering fortresses. Among the ten individuals of the Central Continent, the old calculating Huai Yin, and the great sword saint Lu Zhi, were all clear representations of the continent’s combat power. The cross-continental ferries that traversed between the Central Continent and South Posao had been transporting goods for over a decade.

Additionally, Xu Jun and the mountain search map were hidden from view. Moreover, there was certainly more than just one scholar waiting to strike; there was also the Mo family leader, who was solely responsible for one front.

While the barbaric world did not attack South Posao, the Haoran world had to defend it, making the situation appear straightforward, yet it was anything but.

Xu Jun asked, “The Holy One is beyond the heavens; I understand that. But where is the Second Sage?”

The old scholar replied in thought, “Take the back route.”

Xu Jun shook his head, “Relying solely on the Second Sage, it would still be difficult to accomplish anything.”

The old scholar said, “Who says it’s just him?”

Xu Jun suddenly understood, “No wonder you need to borrow a name, and then request a mountain master from the Confucian Temple. What a skilled move, what boldness! What a reversal of mountains and rivers!”

A Tuo Yue Mountain, half a Sword Qi Great Wall left, not to mention the hundred thousand great mountains in between. Depending on someone’s calculations, the old blind man might even be willing to change that initial intention of remaining uninvolved.

For example, old blind man, how about moving Tuo Yue Mountain to your home? That’s just one possibility. Cui Zhan was truly adept at calculating human hearts and nature.

Cui Zhan’s ideas seemed always fanciful yet somehow within reach. A century ago, if Cui Zhan had said he would use the power of a nation to build a second Sword Qi Great Wall in the Haoran world, who would not think he was dreaming? Who would take him seriously? But now, Cui Zhan’s dream had come true. What made Cui Zhan feel even more distant was not just that the embroidered tiger was too clever, but that everything he thought, dreamed, and planned, he never spoke a word to outsiders.

Cui Zhan had those three embroidered matters, along with the city lord of Baidi City, making a deal in the colorful cloud scheme, just one aspect of it.

In a certain battle of calculations, Cui Zhan had once outsmarted the founding ancestor of the arts, but for some unknown reason, that ancestor, who ranked low among the hundred schools but held high aspirations, despite losing to an outsider in the fundamental path of the Dao, felt incredibly pleased, declaring, “I have gained ten, and the world is sufficient,” leaving a great mystery to this day. Even within the arts, no one knew what exactly “ten” meant.

Moreover, before Cui Zhan defected from the Confucian lineage, he had given up the easily attainable position of Grand Scholar and Vice Master of the Confucian Temple. Otherwise, following the normal course, he could have contended for the position of Master of the Confucian Temple in a century. Unfortunately, Cui Zhan ultimately chose a path of extreme decline, becoming a lost dog, wandering the world alone, and later becoming a ridiculous national master in Baoping Continent. This significant secret, due to its involvement in the higher-ups of the Central Continent’s Confucian Temple, was not widely known, only whispered among the mountain peaks.

Regrettably, all of this was but fleeting moments.

However, there would always be some who genuinely felt that the Haoran world would lose much flavor without a single embroidered tiger.

The old scholar suddenly inquired, “What is the cleanest and most fastidious thing in the world?”

Xu Jun shook his head, “I do not know. Is it what the first disciple asked his master long ago?”

The old scholar answered his own question, “It is morality.”

Xu Jun nodded, “I wholeheartedly agree.”

The old scholar added, “Flaws do not overshadow brilliance. How can that be?”

Xu Jun laughed, “That is indeed the logic of it.”

The old scholar stomped his foot and declared, “Let’s go, let’s go.”

Xu Jun bowed.

The old scholar returned the bow. 

These old sages always maintained such formalities with him; it seemed he had suffered for not having a scholar's title. 

The old scholar whispered to Chen Chunan, sending word to cross the continent back to the Central Continent, and then to speak with that tall figure in Suishan.

At the entrance of Suishan, the old scholar stumbled and fell flat on his face, landing in the dirt.

The golden-armored deity sat on the steps, laughing, “Oh, grand ceremony! Consider this your way of settling the debt you owe to Suishan.”

Getting up and shaking off his sleeves, the old scholar strode to the foot of the mountain, standing beside the mountain deity, their heights nearly equal.

The old scholar gazed up at the peak of Suishan, his expression solemn.

The towering mountain deity chuckled, “What now? Do you need something from someone again?”

The old scholar rubbed his hands and face, saying, “Asking others for help is like swallowing a three-foot sword—difficult! Moreover, I have never been good at asking for help; it’s doubly hard.”

The mountain deity seemed a bit amused; if the Sage had to ask for help, he truly wouldn’t be the Sage.

The old scholar turned and asked, “When I saw the old man earlier, did he say ‘the humble place shines brightly’?”

The mountain deity shook his head, “Not a word from me; if it weren’t you, I wouldn’t have spoken at all.”

The old scholar wore a doubtful expression, noticing that the giant was as righteous as the accompanying sage, and could only express regret, “Not being perceptive, we’ve wasted so many words. If it were me, I would have already set up a few altars at the mountain’s peak, prepared some tea, and then asked the old man if he needed me to chop off that fellow’s head, thumping my chest and making a loud promise. ‘Oh old man, just say the word! I’ll take on any danger for you!’ If I can’t slay him, I’ll just bring my own head to meet you…”

The mountain deity frowned, “Do you really think the Sage wouldn’t hear your nonsense?”

When they were alone, the old scholar could ramble on, but with the Sage seated at the mountain’s peak, the mountain deity really didn’t dare to indulge the old scholar’s flights of fancy. 

The Sage was not one for jokes.

The Holy Rites Sage would adhere to the rules but could occasionally make light-hearted comments. 

The Second Sage was famously meticulous.

In fact, apart from the old scholar, the vast majority of the founding ancestors of the various Dao lineages were quite serious.

The old scholar jumped up with a slap, “You daring fool! How dare you underestimate our Sage’s supreme Dao! Whether he wields the brush or takes up arms, who isn’t invincible? His literary prowess stands unrivaled, and in martial arts, there’s none to compare! Even that Dao Old Two seems awkward; wanting to praise the old man but too shy to do so, he hides and twists his words in that painter Cao Rong’s landscape scroll. Damn it, if only that Cao Rong hadn’t asked me for a seal, I would have offered a ‘please take a seat,’ then beside that Dao Old Two, I would have stamped ‘you’re not worthy’… This time the old man strikes, embodying the essence of kingship mixed with righteousness, a sage among heroes, a grand undertaking, a mighty spirit, and a magnificent intent!”

The Suishan deity turned a deaf ear; it seemed that the old scholar’s plea today was not a small matter. Otherwise, in past conversations, no matter how thick his skin, he could at least keep some dignity, but today he was utterly shameless. To praise someone was one thing, but to take credit for labor was another.

Indeed, the old scholar stumbled again and was directly pulled up to the peak, indicating that even the old man could no longer bear it.

The old sage at the mountain peak remarked, “Scholar, you’re far more likable during the debates of the Three Doctrines.”

After rising and bowing, the old scholar wore a bitter expression, “The Confucian Temple hasn’t given me ample opportunities to showcase my debating skills.”

Implying that it wasn’t his unwillingness to support Confucianism, but rather that the Confucian Temple hadn’t allowed him to shine, the old sage couldn’t force him into a corner, expecting him to endure great grievances while suppressing minor complaints.

The old sage chuckled, “Here for Bai Ye?”

The old scholar glanced toward the direction of Fuyou Continent and sighed, “No need for me to ask.”

The sage seated at the peak of Suishan continued to confront the gray-clad old man near the Jiaolong Ditch from afar.

The old scholar exhaled; it was indeed steady, as expected of the old man.

The celestial phenomena, mountains, and rivers of the golden-armored and Baoping continents remained unaffected by the divine powers of the great ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain in the slightest.

On the other side, the Holy Rites Sage was also faring well for the moment.

However, those ancient remnants that had originally traveled far away were still continuously gathering. Historically, the Holy Rites Sage had led the Confucian Temple’s master, vice-master, and a group of Bai Yujing immortals, along with the great master of Longhu Mountain, Sun Huaizhong from Daxuandu, and a group of Buddhist disciples from the Western Buddhist Kingdom, on a long journey. Unfortunately, the results had been minimal. One vice-master of the Confucian Temple had fallen beyond the heavens; if it weren’t for the subsequent three-four conflicts, the first disciple of the Confucian lineage, Cui Zhan, would have had a chance to fill that gap. Regrettably, the old scholar knew that Cui Zhan’s ambitions had never been aimed there.

Ten thousand years ago, countless techniques fell from the heavens. Whether given by certain ancient deities or struck down by humanity from above.

The myriad techniques that fell to the world included the most lethal ones, undoubtedly obtained by sword cultivators. 

For humanity, the greatest contributions and merits belonged to the sword cultivators.

Thus, in today’s world, the path of the Dao favored sword cultivators the most, yet it was subtly suppressed by the relatively fragmented heavenly Dao, resulting in the most challenging bottleneck for ascended beings.

However, in terms of the sheer number of divine powers and techniques acquired, as well as the self-realization and proof of the Dao, the dedicated sword cultivators could not compare to the numerous ancestors among the Three Doctrines. Though their paths varied, they had all reached incredible heights thousands of years ago.

As a result, the true “combat skills” of the three of them were capable of shaking the heavens and the earth.
The old scholar was always willing to ask questions, which made the Sage of the Ancients more inclined to share his thoughts. Because of this, the old scholar learned something significant: ever since the moment the founders of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism attained enlightenment, they had never truly committed themselves to a confrontation.

During that discussion by the riverside, Chen Qing, who had exceptional swordsmanship and a remarkably good temper, had once declared, "If we are to fight, then let’s fight." The reason it never escalated to actual combat was largely due to the attitude of the three sect founders.

In that moment, Daoist Patriarch had revealed a profound truth: the true enemy of the Great Dao lies within us. It resides in humanity, in our innermost hearts, in all living beings themselves. It has nothing to do with techniques or divine powers.

The overwhelming force in Bai Yujing (White Jade Capital) was merely a manifestation of the Daoist's heart, transformed into an otherworldly demon. In the Western Buddhist Kingdom, it was the lingering attachments of vengeful spirits that were being suppressed. The righteous teachings of the world aimed to guide all beings toward goodness, allowing various schools of thought to flourish, all to assist Confucianism in addressing the needs of humanity.

At the core of it all, it boiled down to one thing: the self.

For countless years, humanity's true adversary in life and death has always been ourselves. Even after a thousand more years, this is likely to remain unchanged.

If we fail, it will usher in an unstoppable age of decline.

If we succeed, the world can continue to ascend, truly lifting the hearts of humanity to the heavens.

"Everyone is a sage."

"All beings possess Buddha-nature."

"Each individual must attain purity; all must achieve purity."

The goodwill of humanity in this lifetime, the karmic ties of past and future lives, the lofty and subtle nature of the Daoist heart.

Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going?

In broad strokes, the answers have largely been revealed.

As for the Fuyou Continent (Fuyou Zhou)...

Bai Ying, the Five Mountains, the Revered Peak, Yuan Shou, Niu Dao, and Qie Yun.

Only the six great demonic kings remained; what is there to fear? Even with Liu Cha, who was poised to unleash his sword, what difference would it make? Now, the Fuyou Continent is just a vast, untamed realm—what of it?

In essence, it equates to a Bai Ye (White) without the immortal sword "Taibai," along with a Grand Master from Longhu Mountain who also lacks an immortal sword. Add to that Chen Chunan, who is situated in half of the Southern Bosa Continent, supplemented by the talismans of Xuan, a Fire Dragon Immortal, and a somewhat less scheming Zheng Huaixian from Bai Di City (White Emperor City), not to mention the elusive Liu family God of Wealth from Aiaizhou.

It is just this handful of people.

The old master chuckled, "Easy to talk when you’re not in the thick of it, isn’t it?"

The old scholar quickly took a seat nearby, exclaiming, "By the heavens!"

Suddenly, Bai Ze materialized in their midst, reminding the Sage of the Ancients, "What you truly need to be wary of in the Confucian Temple is that literary sea of the wild lands. He has already devoured the Lotus Temple Master and Yao Jia. This person has grand ambitions. Once he is fully sated in the wild lands and returns home to flaunt his power, it will be even more troublesome."

The Sage of the Ancients nodded with a smile.

Bai Ze had no good impression of Jia Sheng. This Wen Hai was meticulous and seemed to have abandoned any ties to the two worlds. It was as if, from the moment he crossed the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had chosen to tread a path that had not been walked for millennia, aspiring to become a high and mighty deity, looking down upon the mortal realm.

The old scholar frowned in silence, eventually sighing, "He is determined to scheme for the future of many with just one person; that one person is the common folk of the world. Humanity has been nearly extinguished, truly surpassing even the gods in their divine essence. No, they are not even as noble as those ancient deities."

The old scholar looked left and right, whispering to the Sage of the Ancients and Bai Ze, "Can we agree to this?"

Bai Ze felt helpless; nodding now would be foolish, but shaking his head in refusal? Could he really do that? He had already given out those mountain maps; he certainly couldn't offer himself up as well.

Thus, Bai Ze shifted the topic, saying, "The Fuyou Continent is fishing in a dry pond."

With that great demonic king crazily drawing on the spiritual energy of the continent, they were merely waiting for Bai Ye to exhaust his energy.

The old scholar rolled up his sleeves.

Bai Ze remarked, "Who are you trying to impress with all this show?"

The old scholar retorted angrily, "Look at this! It’s truly heartbreaking. Both of you revered Bai brothers are my greatest admiration. Look at Bai Ye's unparalleled poetry and swordsmanship! He effortlessly cleaved open the Yellow River's cave, casually struck down the restless demonic beasts of the Ascended Realm, toiled tirelessly to carve out the Fifth World, and with three strikes, killed the great demon king Yao Jia. Now he’s single-handedly challenging six great kings..."

The old master replied nonchalantly, "I’m aware of all this."

The old scholar immediately recoiled, laughing, "Alright then."

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 848: One Slash After Another, Only My Triumph**

Yuan Shou stood firm, his foot planted on an ancient relic sword, while a long staff spun unpredictably in his hands. A thick aura of energy expanded outward in a great circle, shattering the multicolored rain that fell from the sky, each drop bursting apart like fragile glass.

The towering golden-armored demon, known as Niudao, remained unmoved, allowing the sharp sword energy to batter against his armor. He could only lament that the energy was too light and sparse to break through the cage that encased him. Thus, he awaited the moment when Bai Ye would unleash his first full-force strike, ready to intercept.

Cutting Rhyme lightly tapped the sword-preserving gourd at his waist. He met sword energy with sword energy, resting a finger against his cheek, squinting as he gazed at the beautiful scene before him. He murmured softly, the wind and rain swirling, dispersing the chaotic energies.

Seated on a golden futon, a robust giant exhaled gently, causing the rain and sword energy to tilt away from him.

The dragon-headed figure, Yang Zhi, turned his innate divine ability, gathering the rain around him. Ultimately, it coalesced into shimmering droplets of seven colors, but they quickly succumbed to the sword energy's assault, shattering with a resounding crack. Yet, they reformed instantaneously. After several cycles of gathering and breaking, a few puppet maids, each cradling a pipa, received a command and began collecting the rain droplets infused with sword energy into their instrument's strings. Most of the pipas could not withstand the fine sword energy and crumbled into dust, but there remained a shimmer of brilliance from the surviving pipa. Thin threads of sword energy traced the patterns on the phoenix wood, ultimately manifesting delicate sword intent along the pipa's strings. Yang Zhi reached out and grasped a pipa between his fingers, focusing intently. As he did so, the strings trembled, but they snapped one after another.

Yang Zhi shook his head at Yuan Shou, indicating that Bai Ye's sword energy left no trace to deduce or evolve from, and that they would need to seek other opportunities.

Yang Zhi, or perhaps all the throne demons involved in this siege, needed to understand one crucial point.

What exactly had Bai Ye’s fourteenth realm merged with in the vast world of righteousness?

Earlier on the battlefield, whether it was the Great Wall of Sword Energy or presiding over Golden Armor Continent, Bai Ying had always presented himself as a skeletal figure on a throne. Today, however, he had withdrawn the throne of bones and transformed into a middle-aged man. Clad in a dull, lifeless robe, he had manifested from the skeletal throne.

Beside Bai Ying stood an old sword attendant, formed from celestial brew that had nourished his head into flesh and bone. Towering over others, this was the true visage of the former Dragon Monarch, though he had lost his spirit and intelligence, and Bai Ying had named him “Long Jian.” Currently, the sword attendant held the long sword “Zhu Zhao,” a remnant soul of a sword cultivator that Bai Ying had painstakingly sought out, expending countless heavenly materials to refine it into an immortal weapon. The Mount Tuo Yue had long been aware of this but feigned ignorance.

Standing atop a Dragon Monarch's skull and refining a remnant soul of observation, Bai Ying had made prior arrangements with the ascended old figure, transforming the decayed being into an existence akin to an ethereal puppet—neither human, demon, god, nor immortal. The demon Bai Ying seemed to have no limits to his ambitions.

The only advantage that the old figure, Wan Yan Lao Jing, had gained was the ability to avoid the impending heavenly tribulation, completely extinguishing his path as a pinnacle cultivator of humanity. He clung to life, even if it meant enduring a fate worse than death. Perhaps one day, in the wild world, he might have the opportunity to rise again, especially when the mountain and river spirits of the area would not object.

Bai Ying's thoughts were not on this torrential rain; it was just Bai Ye casually drawing his sword from its sheath.

He was one of the key figures in this siege against Bai Ye. The reason he was “one” of them was that Bai Ying was temporarily unaware that Mr. Zhou was discreetly advising other throne demons.

The sword attendant with the visage of the Dragon Monarch, Long Jian, swung his sword toward the heavy rain above, slicing through it like parting the heavens. The sword light created a rift, and on either side, the sword energy cascaded like a fine river of time, before being swept away by the overarching principles, disappearing without a trace.

Bai Ying continued to channel his innate divine ability, temporarily gathering the spiritual energy of the continent within the sea of clouds.

Bai Ying needed to siphon all the spiritual energy from the vast formation of the continent. Even if he could not capture it all, he aimed to muddle the pure energy with filthy, corrupting forces. The sea of clouds beneath Bai Ying's feet, littered with bones and exuding a malevolent aura, was designed to ensure that every time Bai Ye unleashed a strike, his personal microcosm would exhaust its spiritual energy bit by bit.

Generally speaking, once a cultivator reaches the ascended realm, facing an opponent, even in life-and-death struggles, it is rare for them to find themselves lacking in spiritual energy. Years ago, in the wilds where throne demons hid, Ah Liang exemplified this; despite being pursued by several powerful demons, he would shatter any signs of being cornered without hesitation, striking fiercely to escape. This method of sword flight, capable of traversing thousands of miles in an instant, was his crucial means of survival. He was unafraid of spells and techniques, able to withstand several divine arts, but feared getting ensnared and exhausting his energy.

As long as a cultivator's microcosm remains connected to the greater cosmos, it grants them the blessings of a paradise, making it exceedingly difficult for mountain peak cultivators to be killed.

Typically, battles between ascended beings involve showcasing their abilities, with the tides of time and location as variables; victory or defeat is often commonplace. The true measure of whether one can be deemed powerful lies in the ability to slay the opponent. Thus, whether in the wild world or among the ten from the Central Plains and the ten from the righteous realm, whether one can rise to a throne or be counted among the top ten depends on whether they have truly killed an ascended cultivator or at least rendered another incapable of retaliating. For instance, the Fire Dragon Master had once blocked the entrance to Luoshui Pit for months, and with a single slap, he could send an immortal flying. As for the enigmatic defenses in that battlefield of Golden Armor Continent, they had effortlessly slain a jade-grade demon cultivator without even casting a spell—in the eyes of true mountain peak cultivators, such feats were hardly worth mentioning.

If it weren't for the multitude of rules in the righteous realm, such dismissals would be numerous.

Thus, in the wild world, ascended beings often choose to align themselves with stronger foes or completely distance themselves from the hidden lairs of powerful throne demons. Take the old blind man’s guard dog, who had once been renowned for his ferocity in battle as an ascended being. Yet after a trip to the Great Wall of Sword Energy, where he attempted to contribute by crafting artifacts for the old blind man, he was met with disdain and kicked aside, left to lie on the ground, too intimidated to even breathe heavily.

Reaching the ascended realm places one in a lofty position, detached from worldly concerns; they witness the passage of time and the stability of mountains and rivers as if in their grasp. They are even praised by Qi Practitioners as having achieved a form of immortality, existing alongside the heavens and earth…

Of course, this is an exaggerated claim; to aspire to such immortality, ascended beings lack the qualifications, unlike Wan Yan Lao Jing, who could only wait for death.

The higher one ascends, the narrower the paths become, until the only route left for those who reach the summit is to break through another realm, requiring a unique alignment with the principles of the world. However, concerning this matter, even across the combined realms of the fourteen, the number of cultivators is still exceedingly few. Moreover, once someone is genuinely at that level, they tend to keep their insights close to their chest, as discussing the fundamental principles of the Dao could cost them half their life.

The old scholar harmonized with the three continents of the righteous realm. What happened next? He was cut into three parts with precision by the cultured sea and refined into a robe of law for Xiao Xian to wear.

Bai Ye gently gripped the celestial sword Taibai, holding it before him, and flicked his finger.

The long sword vibrated, releasing a bright beam of light like a crystal-clear autumn pond, deep and serene. The sword energy and water vapor intertwined, forming a swirling dragon pool, fluctuating unpredictably, with sun and moon coexisting within its depths. Bai Ye had once traveled with friends to visit immortals, seeing countless moons in the mortal world.

In the end, it seemed that Bai Ye himself was the true immortal.

One round after another, bright moons hung in the air, as if six additional lanterns had appeared out of nowhere, varying in size and height, perfectly positioned above the heads of the six throne demons.

The bright moons and moonlight suddenly converged into a line.

The sword light cascaded down.

Yuan Shou frowned slightly; this sword technique was dazzlingly frightening, befitting a cultivator of the fourteenth realm. The visions in his heart were nearly the truth of the Dao.

Fortunately, Bai Ye was not a sword cultivator.

Yuan Shou suddenly grew to a height of a hundred feet, swinging his staff toward the sword light. The surrounding spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged violently, and it was unclear whether it was moonlight or sword light, shattering like countless flying swords. The clouds beneath Yuan Shou's feet erupted, creating a massive hole.

The golden-armored divine being remained utterly still, enduring a sword strike, allowing the beam of light to pierce through his head. His golden armor shook violently, fracturing even more.

Yang Zhi swept away the sword light with his dragon tail, instantly turning blood and flesh into a muddled mess. A massive wound marred his true form, yet he remained oblivious to the terrifying injury, which healed at a visible speed.

Yuan Shou stood atop the ancient long sword "Qun Zhen," pointing his staff toward Bai Ye high above, laughing heartily, “Bai Ye, is this all you can do with your flashy tricks? Far inferior to your earlier three strikes that shattered the radiant armor. Or is it that after three strikes, you’ve already been injured?! Why test the depth of our cultivation? You’re bound to die anyway, so why not be like Dong San and trade your life in a straightforward manner?”

After all, Bai Ye would inevitably attempt to exchange blows with one of them. Yuan Shou certainly did not mind if Bai Ye's sword struck him; it was just that once Bai Ye unleashed his full might, whether it was three strikes or five, who knew who he aimed to kill? It was impossible to guess. Yuan Shou's ferocity flared, revealing a genuine curiosity about what Bai Ye would choose in his moment of desperation.

Would he cling to life, deliberately delaying for the rescue of the mysterious assistance? Or did he have greater aspirations, hoping that the sage might intervene and pull him from the conflict between the two realms? If so, the ancestors of Tuo Yue Mountain would surely let the battlefield of the old dragon in the treasure bottle continent or the remnants of the northern territory of Golden Armor Continent shatter into chaos.

Bai Ye could hardly be bothered to respond to Yuan Shou.

His fingers brushed casually over the sword's body, and thousands of golden characters instantly materialized densely in the palm of his hand.

Bai Ye smiled and said, “Go.”

A beam of sword light flickered and vanished, akin to a sword cultivator summoning forth their life sword, initiating an exchange with Yuan Shou that was equivalent to a sword cultivator of the ascended realm.

The other five throne demons prepared to receive a strike as well. No one could afford to be idle; before encountering Bai Ye, their numerous schemes were one thing, but now they had to consider their own strategies. Wasn’t that tiring?

“Come at me! I’ll shatter your flying sword with my staff!” Yuan Shou laughed heartily, shifting to hold the staff with both hands and striking the incoming sword light with a powerful swing. The overwhelming force of the strike, indeed, was not to be underestimated; beneath the long sword "Qun Zhen," the area within a hundred miles was devoid of cloud.

The golden demon Niudao, shimmering with golden light, had previously dared to present himself for slaughter even before Bai Ye. Now, he slightly furrowed his brow. Had Bai Ye already detected his flaws in the Dao so quickly? No longer allowing the sword light to pierce through his armor, he manifested a colossal Dharma form and reached out to grasp the sword light, clenching his fist. Golden light poured through his fingers like cascading waterfalls.

Simultaneously, Niudao activated his innate divine ability, rearranging the numerous caverns where his life objects were stored within his microcosm, causing the surging spiritual energy within to flood like a diverted river, ultimately swapping places with the lake and marsh “stationed” there.

The handsome-faced demon, Cutting Rhyme, wore a smile, pinching together a sword formula with two fingers and gently pointing, “Go as well.”

Previously engaging sword energy with sword energy, they now faced sword light with sword light. From a dozen miles away, two beams of sword light collided like soaring swords.

On Bai Ying's side, it was still the sword attendant responsible for receiving the strikes. Fortunately, Long Jian's long sword was indeed a genuine immortal weapon, and because it was forged from a remnant soul of observation, it possessed unique intricacies, allowing Bai Ying not to have to act personally. In terms of combat, Bai Ying had always kept a low profile; in the hierarchy-dominated wild world, he was considered one of the weaker throne demons. Bai Ying had almost no record of personally battling ascended demon cultivators and mostly commanded armies of skeletal soldiers to crush foes. In the rare instances he faced a difficult opponent, he would at most allow Long Jian to strike. Moreover, Bai Ying's domain of bones had no shortage of powerful allies.

In places outside of the Daoist temple, like the Lotus Blossom Ancestral Master, who kept his distance from the swaying waters, when encountering other throne demons like Huang Luan, he would be deemed “ineffective in battle.”

Yuan Shou struck down the second beam of sword light, causing his sleeves to flutter wildly. The winds churned powerfully, and as Yuan Shou swayed slightly, he squinted and said, “Bai Ye, if you have the ability, send down another seventeen or eighteen beams of sword light! I want to see if your sword light outnumbers mine… Oh! Here they come…”

Just as you wish.

The more words, the more swords.

Beams of sword light surged towards Yuan Shou.

Special attention was given to this throne demon.

Yuan Shou burst into laughter, shattering sword light, deflecting sword light, and then sweeping at sword light, encountering various dangers. Each stroke of sword light slicing through the air would tear apart the world, as if a paper cutter were effortlessly slicing through a sheet of white rice paper.

Yuan Shou held his staff with both hands, his ferocity apparent. His eyes blazed red, each pupil containing a glimmering speck of golden light. Though he shattered the sword light with his staff, Yuan Shou remained fixated on the one-handed sword-wielding Bai Ye, his sight encompassing a thousand miles. Among the several figures of Bai Ye holding swords, one particularly clear “Bai Ye” could even faintly reveal the trajectory of his sword strikes. This was one of Yuan Shou's innate abilities, allowing him to perceive the threads of fate and foresee the future.

Demons are notoriously resilient in their true forms. Though Yuan Shou's face was mangled by countless fragmented sword energies, it only took an instant for him to regain his visage. As for his robe, it bore the same fate; as a throne demon enduring through the ages, he wouldn’t dare traverse the world without donning an immortal-grade robe.

On the battlefield of the Great Wall of Sword Energy, throne demons rarely made many strikes, with those who exerted themselves being exceptionally few. More often, they adhered to the orders of the celestial military, supervising the assaults of the demon army.

The gray-robed elder intentionally aimed for them to concentrate their thoughts on the righteous realm.

Liu Cha drew his sword solely for Ah Liang.

Unless the ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain personally intervened to suppress him, Ah Liang's reckless and fearless combat style would likely lead to the destruction of several military tents.

In the later stages of the conflict, the Radiant Armor had targeted the lord of one of Bai Yujing’s twelve towers, driven by greed, deliberately singling out the nearly exhausted Daoist sage. This provoked the latter, who, unwilling to meet a demise without purpose, summoned Lu Zhi to drop his sword. Lu Zhi fulfilled his promise, almost cleaving the meticulously crafted golden throne of Radiant Armor in two.

The Radiant Armor’s rampage through the mountains and rivers of Fuyou Continent, shattering shrines and plundering fragments of the golden body, stemmed from this incident.

Yang Zhi spoke to Bai Ying through thought, “Is Bai Ye not going all out yet?”

Bai Ying replied with a smile, “Aren't we also just biding our time, only defending without counterattacking?”

Yang Zhi asked, “Will it take you half an incense stick's time to gather all the spiritual energy of this continent? Do you need my help? If Bai Ye chooses to abandon his dignity, it could become quite troublesome.”

Bai Ying nodded, “I’d be more than happy to.”

In fact, should Bai Ye truly compete for spiritual energy with him, it would indeed be quite troublesome.

However, any trouble would fall squarely on Bai Ye, not on them, the six throne demons.

This hunt was orchestrated by Bai Ying, employing the most straightforward method to deal with a cultivator of the fourteenth realm.

If Bai Ye were to engage in combat while simultaneously opening the doors to the caverns to absorb vast amounts of spiritual energy, the complications would be immense. Zhou meticulously explained that during Bai Ye's struggle for spiritual energy, they should do their utmost to hinder him, preventing him from discerning the truth.

Regardless, being caught in this scheme was a massive predicament for Bai Ye; he had to either remain composed and wait for his spiritual energy to deplete, ultimately dying in battle, or act rashly, causing trouble and meeting an early demise. 

As things stood, it seemed Bai Ye was either overly proud or had sensed something amiss.

Neither mattered in the grand scheme.
Yángzhǐ, adorned with a crown fit for an emperor and draped in a dark dragon robe, gazed down at a vast, suspended landscape that spanned millions of miles. Yet, it was a mere black-and-white depiction, unlike the vibrant rivers and mountains of the mortal realm. 

As Yángzhǐ navigated around the Five Sacred Mountains and other mountain ranges, all the rivers, lakes, and marshes within her sight suddenly roiled as if boiling. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was drawn into the water, coalescing into a powerful current of vitality. 

First came the sea of clouds, commanded by the white figure, absorbing the spiritual energy while simultaneously stirring chaotic forces that disrupted the atmospheric phenomena of an entire continent. Meanwhile, Yángzhǐ wielded control over the rivers, voraciously consuming the energy around her. 

Clearly, their intention was to turn the continent of Fúyáo into a desolate land loathed by all Qi cultivators. 

Taking advantage of the light from the White Sword illuminating Yuán Shǒu, Qièyùn, having nothing better to do, playfully pressed her fingers together, lightly resting them against the sword-raising gourd at her waist. She chuckled, "Well, I might as well lend a hand since I'm just sitting around." 

From this point forward, the celestial wine brewed atop the mountain would be the only one infused with the most spiritual energy. Now known as Jiǔyè, Qièyùn found herself reluctant to even drink it. 

Upon arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, where she took on the alias Qīnghuā, she personally witnessed the sword immortals of the Great Wall, as delicate and fragmented as fine porcelain. 

In the vast world of Hàorán, known as Jiǔyè, she not only collected various celestial wines but also specialized in skinning female cultivators to mend her own features. There were the Yulong Sect near the Upside-down Mountain, the Yuzhigang of Tóngyè Continent, and the ancestral mountain of the Kōnghóu Sect… 

Traveling far across Hàorán, it was a journey well worth taking. 

The only one not idling about was the sword-wielding elder, who held a staff with both hands. 

With the sheer number of sword lights, coming one after another, he truly had no time to waste. The so-called casual strokes of an ordinary sword were, after all, the signature flying sword of an Ascended Realm sword cultivator. 

Some sword lights were swept down by Yuán Shǒu's staff, plunging toward a mountain below the sea of clouds, causing the earth to quake and shatter, leveling it to the ground. 

Other sword lights were smashed into the great river, creating towering waves and forming a massive lake, as the river's flow tilted and surged into it, causing the water level downstream to drop by several feet. 

Yuán Shǒu cursed, "Is this ever going to end?!" 

Part of his frustration stemmed from feeling personally targeted, which left him extremely aggrieved. He dared not approach the white figure and found himself trapped, allowing the other thrones to watch him as if he were a monkey in a circus. 

Another part of his irritation came from the very real concern for his robe's damage. If this kept up, it would not just be a matter of superficial damage but a significant loss of quality. His robe was crafted from the roots of twelve dragon veins found throughout the wild world, but the white figure unleashed far too many sword lights, each arriving in an instant. Even though Yuán Shǒu could shatter or repel some of the sword lights, the shattered sword energy remained too dense, turning his once-mendable robe into a tattered mess, riddled with countless holes. 

Qièyùn, while drawing spiritual energy from the sword-raising gourd, chuckled, "Elder Yuán, your staff technique is commendable. After this battle, you will surely be renowned throughout the world. You’ve broken seventeen of the white figure’s sword lights, which is far more impressive than shattering the ancestral hall of a continent. Eighteen sword lights now!" 

Yuán Shǒu, staff in hand, his palms bloodied and raw, first jabbed to send a sword light flying, then swept horizontally to break another, splitting the sword light in two. That was the terrifying nature of the white figure's sword; as long as they weren't utterly shattered, any remaining sword light could persistently entangle Yuán Shǒu, making escape impossible. Yuán Shǒu let out a furious roar, his once-elderly features taking on a more primal appearance, as he used the technique of traveling through mountains and rivers to shift several hundred miles away, crushing those two sword lights one after another. 

Earlier, Yuán Shǒu had "slacked off," his strikes slightly weaker, resulting in three sword lights closing in at once. He had nearly suffered a grievous injury when one sword light tore open a large wound on his neck, almost displacing his head. While losing his head would not be a major issue, as he could regenerate even after being decapitated, the injury was still serious, not something that consuming several of Yángzhǐ’s precious fruits could heal. 

Yuán Shǒu’s method of breaking sword lights was straightforward, lacking in any flashy techniques—merely a direct and forceful approach. 

Thus, the white figure's eighteen sword lights did not manifest in full glory. However, if a Qi cultivator were to witness the battle, their resolve could easily shatter. 

Every time the sword light from the white figure burst forth, it clashed with the aura emanating from Yuán Shǒu's strikes, each carrying an essence of Dao. For those cultivating the Dao, observing such a confrontation was akin to fighting against both. 

Qièyùn, ever perceptive, preemptively helped Yuán Shǒu curse out loud before he could open his mouth, laughingly scolding, "Shut up, you whiny old man!" 

Yuán Shǒu spat out a mouthful of blood, realizing why he had produced a disciple of such caliber, one who could stand shoulder to shoulder with the young Hidden Official and Sword Immortal Shòuchén. Feiran, the foremost sword immortal of the Hundred Swords of the Tuoyue Mountain, was said to have been taken in by Qièyùn as a disciple. 

The large demon, Niúdāo, spoke up in a deep tone, "Who’s coming first? Let’s not drag this out any longer; what’s the point?" 

In truth, from the moment six throne-level great demons appeared, to the white figure drawing their sword and shattering the glass-like barrier, to the eighteen sword lights targeting Yuán Shǒu, none of this was as mundane as a few casual drinks at a table. 

The hulking giant seated cross-legged on a golden mat, a great demon with three heads and six arms, rose to his feet, each of his six arms wielding a formidable weapon. He chuckled, "Having witnessed Mr. Bai's poetic sword energy, I will now test the unmatched sharpness of the Immortal Sword Taibai, alongside the prowess of a boundary-breaking martial artist." 

A Qi cultivator, an Ascended Realm practitioner. A pure martial artist, at the tenth "Divine Peak." 

As Wǔyuè rose, not only did he wield his weapons; the golden mat, originally formed from countless golden tomes, transformed into eleven golden talismans, affixed at his ankles, the third eye in the middle of his foreheads, and on his six arms. 

Bái Yīng pinched a luminescent white bone bead between her fingers, using it to gauge the remaining spiritual energy of the world, and smiled at the hulking giant, "We must still exercise caution. The sword held by Bai Ye ultimately comes from the Grand Xuandu Temple. There's no need for you to rush, Wǔyuè; just wait half a stick of incense before you make your move." 

Wǔyuè shook his head, ignoring Bái Yīng's advice. His form shifted to that of a commoner’s height, wielding dual blades—one a straight sword, the other resembling a cleaver—along with a hammer and an axe. 

Once the most disheartened scholar of the Hàorán world, now he stood as the most favored scholar, demonstrating great courtesy. Not only did he mobilize the six great thrones to surround Bai Ye, but he also set up three layers of restrictions for Fúyáo. 

The outermost layer was the flow of Qi from the mountains and rivers of the continent, completely enveloping Fúyáo and cutting off its connection to the spiritual energy of the Hàorán world, resembling the ancient formations of Tóngyè Continent’s Three Regions and Four Symbols, as well as the Baopíng Continent's Twenty-four Solar Terms formation. 

This made the battlefield, already heavily skewed in numbers, all the more favorable to the throne-level great demons of the wild world. 

This expansive landmass, just a battlefield for seven participants. 

The previously shattered glass barrier, struck down by Bai Ye’s sword, had meticulously extracted a portion of the river of time to serve as a second small world. 

Between the two formations, there was a mountain-and-water array, formed by the Five Sacred Mountains and hundreds of rivers across the lands of Fúyáo, located beneath the sea of clouds, resembling a monochrome landscape painting that pulled the "mountain-water forms" into the sky above Fúyáo, with mountains scattered across the stars and rivers crisscrossing, effectively isolating Fúyáo's "heaven and earth" into two halves, reminiscent of the greatest meritorious deed of the past, bringing forth a separation of realms. 

Surrounding Bai Ye of the Fourteen Realms, Zhōu Mì was indeed willing to pay any price. 

Seeing Wǔyuè rise, Bai Ye merely shook his head lightly, noncommittal. 

In an instant, six "thrones" descended around Bai Ye, gradually spreading out, three on each side. 

Each throne-level great demon held a long sword in hand. 

While they confined Bai Ye with three realms, Bai Ye too could confine his enemies with his inner worlds. 

In years long past, filled with vigor, he had traveled to meet the immortals with dear friends, the sights before him grand and majestic—what was it that didn’t exist in his eyes’ heavens and earth? 

One of the Five Sacred Mountains bent slightly, while another stomped heavily on the ground, not invoking the divine ability to traverse mountains and rivers, but charging straight ahead. Each step sent ripples through the very fabric of reality, emptying the spiritual energy within a hundred miles radius. 

With one stroke, a sword cleaved the head of the wielder of the "Five Sacred Mountains," dissipating it only for it to reconstitute elsewhere, as the six throne-level great demons, manifestations of Bai Ye’s heart, surrounded Wǔyuè. 

Wǔyuè found himself momentarily hindered, unable to engage in true combat with Bai Ye, as his three heads and six arms dashed like lightning, unpredictable, shattering those manifestations with a single blow and retaliating against the six figures. 

Wǔyuè wanted to see just how long these manifestations of Bai Ye could endure, as well as determine whether Bai Ye needed to expend spiritual energy. 

Qièyùn chuckled silently, her thumb gently rubbing the sword-raising gourd, truly a sword immortal, Bai Ye. 

She admired him deeply, her heartfelt longing evident. 

This gourd of Qièyùn's bore a long inscription at its base. 

"I wish to offer three hundred thousand in immortal coins, exchanging them with beauties and scholars, to share in a thousand jin of fine wine with the sword immortals of the mortal realm." 

If Bai Ye were to perish today, then for millennia to come, there may never be anyone in the world who resembled Bai Ye again. 

As for the Five Sacred Mountains, there was no real surprise there. 

The demon race held a significant innate advantage in martial arts. However, while they found it easy to enter and ascend quickly, reaching the pinnacle proved more difficult than for humans. After all, there are no truly free lunches in this world. 

In comparison to humans, the demon race's training in martial arts faced far fewer restraints from the Dao. Yet, there were both benefits and drawbacks; lacking in tempering, the number of martial artists at the tenth realm in the wild world was even less than that in the Hàorán world. 

In truth, martial arts today represent a remnant path to divinity from ages past. 

The gods had imposed numerous restrictions upon humanity, with human hearts fluctuating, thoughts tangled, and souls unsteady, and that was just the beginning. 

Innate frailty of the body meant that one was destined to be unable to escape the river of time. The river of time continuously battered the flesh, shortening human lifespans and serving as a considerable limitation. 

In ancient times, the heavenly court boasted many divine beings, while the humans beneath them were but ants. Regardless of their appearance or innate physique, they were relatively close to the divine, yet still far too weak, leading many gods to become increasingly dissatisfied. Even if they deliberately allowed those ants to cluster together, once the human population reached the millions and the deities descended, the earth would shatter, mountains would collapse, and all would perish. This was not comparable to the mutual slaughter between deities or the execution of those slightly larger demons. 

Thus, before techniques and spells arrived on the earthly plane, the gods actively provided humanity with martial arts to harden their bodies. The earliest "Golden Body" realm was the bottleneck, the endpoint of a dead-end path. 

Yet, many talented humans emerged, with the founder of the martial family becoming the first to break through the Golden Body realm. After that, they surged ahead without pause, attracting numerous followers. When the divine beings noticed, they nearly wiped out all those who had opened up the Golden Body realm, leaving only one person who managed to escape under the protection of a supreme deity and personally named the three layers of Boundless Energy, Returning to True, and Divine Reach. Yet, for reasons unknown, the martial path reached a standstill, forever becoming the endpoint of martial arts. 

During this time, some gods regarded this individual as a half-fellow traveler, while others watched coldly, coveting more of the mortal realm's incense. As human martial arts became more refined, the incense would become even more potent and valuable. 

Thus, the martial family, possessing great merits in the heavenly Dao, caused future martial family practitioners to resemble those martial arts masters with divine luck, disregarding the gains and losses of mortal virtue and karmic retribution. Ultimately, it was because they were innately distant from the river of time, while pure martial artists and martial family practitioners shared a significant lineage. 

Since humanity was destined to be unable to escape the river of time, they could only turn to "drink the waters." 

This was the most helpless choice for humanity back in the day. Yet, over time, a different type of Qi cultivator emerged, distinct from the divine beings. Coupled with a supreme deity's favor toward humanity, imparting sword techniques from heaven to earth, and the continuous ascension of humanity led to an increasing number of techniques and spells falling to the mortal plane. In fact, the river of time became one of the greatest surprises leading to the collapse of the gods and the fragmentation of the heavenly court. 

Yuán Shǒu inquired with his heart, "Have you gleaned any clues from your observations of the soul?" 

Bái Yīng replied with a smile, "Tracing back to the source, there is a small glimmer of hope. But I fear Bai Ye is intentionally being vague." 

Yuán Shǒu grew agitated. "This is so frustrating! Bai Ye is just a scholar, not a sword cultivator. His true form is far inferior to ours! If we swarm him, he’ll still have to reveal his true form at the Fourteen Realms! Wǔyuè is familiar with you; you should greet him. He’ll deal with his matters, and I’ll find a chance to strike Bai Ye with my staff, splattering his brain and seeing what he can do then!" 

Bái Yīng stifled a laugh and said, "Why rush? We’ve been talking for only half a stick of incense. If Bai Ye isn't in a hurry, then we don’t need to be either." 

The naturally hot-tempered Yuán Shǒu was about to speak again but sighed instead. 

Bai Ye truly did not know his limits, allowing Bái Yīng and Yángzhǐ to siphon off spiritual energy without interference, yet he insisted on opposing Yuán Shǒu. 

Now, eighteen sword lights hovered around Yuán Shǒu, spanning a thousand miles, the sword energy ominous, with every sword tip aimed at the sword-wielding elder. 

Amidst the sword lights, golden characters appeared. 

Bai Ye’s poetry was unmatched, and his verses became flying swords. 

These eighteen sword lights, their intent and momentum far exceeding before, loomed like mountains across the heavens. 

Seeing this phenomenon, Yuán Shǒu felt not a shred of fear; rather, he felt exhilarated, tearing off his robe and stashing it into his sleeve, donning one of the oldest divine armors known as the Mountain Demon. 

Did Bai Ye truly think of him as a soft target?! 

Yuán Shǒu’s joints cracked like thunder as he sheathed his long sword, "Qúnzhēn," no longer using sword techniques. He gripped his staff with one hand and forcefully jabbed at the empty space beside him, revealing his towering true form of a thousand zhang, still not at its peak perfection. 

The Mountain Demon armor Yuán Shǒu wore, along with the colorful attire from the Sword Qi Great Wall, and the West Peak armor temporarily borrowed by Wèi Xiàn, were all once worn by ancient high-ranking deities, illuminating vast distances. Thus, in ancient times, each time a deity ventured out, they shone like comets streaking across the sky. 

The later generations’ Gānlù armor was merely a replica; it was not due to inferior craftsmanship, but rather that the later Gānlù armor, while precise, lacked the innate material superiority of the ancient divine armors. 

In ancient times, the heavenly court had many cruel punishments, with the Dragon Slaying Platform being just one of them. The deities responsible for enacting justice employed methods that were shocking and awe-inspiring. 

The mountain and water deities of later generations, along with the City God and the spirits of the Civil and Military Temples, had to first be sanctioned before they could be sculpted into golden bodies. Compared to the ancient deities, they had already lost much of their essence and required the incense of the mortal realm to sustain them. Once deprived of that incense, their golden bodies would falter. In contrast, the ancient deities existed at a level far above the mortals, and the incense, while important, was not an absolute necessity; without it, they could still endure indefinitely, until they faced a calamity aligned with their innate destiny. If they survived, they could ascend; if not, their golden blood would merge with the river of time. 

Corpses would transform into stars. 

Eons of silence. 

Bai Ye glanced at the false mountains and rivers depicted in the scroll, then at the towering demon, Yángzhǐ. 

Earlier, when the bright moon transformed into a line, asking the sword of the Six Thrones, a sword light had descended, severing the path of the river dragon. Thus, Yángzhǐ, a member of the dragon lineage, felt genuine fear, while the remaining throne-level demons appeared to be merely passively observing. 

Bai Ye gazed at the vast river now brimming with spiritual energy and smiled. The way of water was not his forte; he had merely broken through its techniques, severing holes into the heavens. 

With a thought, the rivers began to rise from their beds, transforming into magnificent, straight lines of sword energy. In the human realm, swords surged forth, a chaotic swarm of blades aiming at Yángzhǐ, the one most versed in the Dao of Water.
Yan Zhi let out a cold snort as the river of long swords approached her within a hundred miles, shattering into a magnificent downpour, returning to the mortal realm. Was Bai Ye not going to draw his sword for real yet?

Bai Ye turned to glance at Bai Ying, having heard that this formidable demon was skilled in commanding an army of bones. In his heart, he silently recited five words: Heaven, Earth, Will, Law.

"Have you not seen the poems of the borderlands in the books? Have you not seen the light cavalry with their blades chasing the white clouds?"

It was well-known that Bai Ye only had a superficial understanding of military strategy. He murmured, “Even after all these years, I still feel that the laws of heaven and earth flow more smoothly from my tongue.”

The skeletal demon Bai Ying smiled slightly and finally summoned her life-bound artifact, a grand banner that rose behind her, as the army of bones surged forth to clash with the galloping legions of spirits.

In that moment, whether they had made a move or not, all the throne demons sensed a subtle omen. Bai Ye swung his sword, cutting through the golden armor of the divine being, cleaving both armor and body in two.

Behind Bai Ye, Qi Yun’s situation mirrored his own. She was struck by a sword, but unlike the golden-armored divine being, Qi Yun only bore a delicate sword mark from her forehead downwards, as if she had endured a blow but was still reluctant to part with her skin. In truth, it was Bai Ye who had truly delivered the strike. Qi Yun believed she could not evade it, and by tearing her own body apart, she narrowly avoided that fateful blow from Bai Ye.

This was still a distraction of two swords.

What if Bai Ye focused with all his might on one strike?

Even after the first blow, Qi Yun did not hastily reassemble her body. The lingering aura of the celestial sword was too overwhelming. If she were to merge her body back together, she would be caught in the deadly aftermath of the sword energy, a loss that was not worth the gain.

With a heavy sigh, Qi Yun pondered that the vast world seemed to hold yet another celestial sword, located in the Dragon Tiger Mountain Tianshi Mansion of the Central Land.

It was said that the ancient Fire God, like the Water God with his many summer palaces, ruled over boundless territories, one of which was situated in the planet of Mars. 

Moreover, it was rumored that there were attendants on Mars skilled in forging, using the planet as a furnace to extract fire essence as charcoal, manipulating the River of Time to draw forth fire, wielding stars as hammers. They would shatter them and discard them, only to replace them with new ones, ultimately forging several long swords for the ancient deities of the heavenly court.

It seemed as though all the world’s charm had been seized by the vast realm of righteousness. 

Qi Yun sighed repeatedly. It should not be like this.

Ten thousand years ago, after the discussions by the riverside, there had actually been two secret meetings: one was the Dao discussions among the three teachings, and the other was a dispute within the demon race, leading to the separation of the Great Ancestor and Bai Ze.

In the ensuing ten thousand years, the wilderness was divided, and conflicts arose without end.

Among the local cultivators of the vast realm of righteousness, the fourteen realms were represented not only by the Sage of Rites, the Sub-Sage, and the Literary Sage after the unification of the three continents, but also by Bai Ye. Now, there was also the sword cultivator A Liang.

As for Bai Ze, the old Taoist of the Dao Observation Pavilion, and that monk known as the Chicken Soup Monk, they were indeed outsiders to the realm of righteousness.

In the five cities and twelve towers of Bai Yu Jing in the Qing Ming realm, the three masters who took turns controlling Bai Yu Jing were all recognized as being within the fourteen realms.

Could it be that among the fourteen realm cultivators in the wilderness, there was only one outsider, the blind old man?

And now, after waiting for ten thousand years, had the world only gained one defector, Xiao Qian, from the Sword Qi Great Wall?

Why was Jian Xiu Yu Si revered by the Crimson Concubine as “Young Master”? And who was the “Old Master”?

Senior brother Qi Yun, junior brother Fei Ran—Qi Yun had taken on disciples in place of his master, adding a new little junior brother, Fei Ran, to their sect. But who were their masters? Were they still alive?

The mountain-seeking map that Bai Ze had given to the old scholar did not list all the peers among the demon race. Did the old scholar have any complaints about this? Did he think that the temper of Bai Ze, who addressed the Sage of Rites simply as “Little Master,” was too good? Before attending that riverside meeting, Bai Ze had achieved great military feats, surpassing even that of the Great Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain. The sword cultivators had their break, and Bai Ze had also personally slain countless sword cultivators.

Once Bai Ye truly drew his sword, he was no longer a scholar.

One slash after another, without any grace.

First, he struck down the golden-armored divine being, breaking the demon bull's golden armor to spare further waiting.

Then he slashed at Qi Yun, forcing her to actively split her body to evade his edge.

He severed Yan Zhi’s tail. He struck down the head of Bai Ying’s sword attendant. He broke the long staff from Yuan Shou’s hand. He cut off the arms of Wu Yu.

The six throne demons each summoned their magical techniques, or unleashed their life-bound powers, almost simultaneously reverting to their true forms, appearing as if they had never been struck by a sword.

Then, he would strike again.

To the world, Bai Ye was still unseen, his swordplay a mystery.

Suddenly, a flash of sword light lit up the heavens and earth.

Even the six throne demons, including Bai Ying, no longer hesitated, revealing their true forms and manifestations. Their Yin spirits roamed free, and their life-bound artifacts shone brilliantly, obscuring the sky.

An old man in purple robes, with white hair and bare feet, who had painstakingly broken through three realms of heaven and earth, paused for a moment and asked softly, “What’s going on?”

The scholar in the azure robe, holding Tai Bai, once again declared himself the most proud of Bai Ye in the mortal realm.

Amidst the talismans and mysteries, the scholar chuckled, “Wait for me to slay Liu Cha.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 849: Bai Ye, the True Sword Immortal, but the Sword Spirits Are Different

The thirteenth strike of the fourteen realms had already opened Yu Xuan's eyes wide, especially when Bai Ye’s sword severed six royal seats in succession, not a single strike missing its mark. This left Yu Xuan utterly impressed.

The sword energy surged forth, magnificent and awe-inspiring.

Some things could indeed only be accomplished by Bai Ye, and he made it seem effortless.

Slicing through those six royal monsters like they were mere vegetables was no small feat. It was not that Yu Xuan looked down on Bai Ying and others; he certainly wouldn't dare to claim he could easily win against any of those royal beasts.

Thus, there was only one reason: Bai Ye wielded his sword with such unreasonable skill.

However, when Yu Xuan heard that Liu Cha was also coming to Fuyou Continent, his earlier speculations proved true, and he couldn't help but smile wryly.

Not only did a seventh royal monster exist, but it was undoubtedly Liu Cha.

A creature who could call A Liang a brother and exchange sword techniques with him was indeed the most suitable ace up their sleeve.

Every cultivator at the peak of the world, just a step away from ascending, received the mountain and water reports in their hands; each letter was of great significance. They were worlds apart from the idle reports that ordinary sect leaders might use to pass the time.

Yu Xuan quickly collected his thoughts and reminded Bai Ye in a serious tone, “The spiritual energy here is peculiar. However, since I'm here, you can safely absorb the spiritual energy within a hundred miles. Beyond that, don’t touch it, not even a bit—it could lead to endless troubles.”

When Yu Xuan arrived, he had forcefully broken through three layers of heavenly restrictions with his signature talisman technique and had finally reached the battlefield where Bai Ye was located.

This was truly the Central Divine Continent; not only had he broken through the gates, but he had also used tens of thousands of rare talismans to perform a mysterious technique known as "Supporting the Mountain's Waist."

Traveling from the northern part of Jin Jia Continent, crossing the sea to Fuyou Continent, Yu Xuan didn’t waste much time; however, breaking open the gates had taken him a full quarter of an hour. This illustrated just how determined the wild world was in surrounding Bai Ye.

It should be noted that Yu Xuan claimed to be second in the world when it came to opening mountains, and no one dared to claim the first position.

The local Daoism of the Vast World was divided into two major branches: talismans and alchemy.

Among them, the talisman branch, alongside a Taoist sect outside Bai Yu Jing in the Qingming World, was said to have three mountain law altars, and Yu Xuan occupied one of them.

Yu Xuan’s feat of snatching away the term "Talisman" from the Dragon Tiger Mountain's Heavenly Master’s estate was nearly on par with taking the "North" from Aiai Continent.

It is said that there was nothing in the world that Yu Xuan could not open, nor any great mountain formations or saints’ worlds he could not break. There were even tales that he could cozy up in the sleeves of his old friends who had ascended, like the Fire Dragon Priest, and others who had once traveled through the Vast World with him.

Every time he crossed continents, he would drop a message. The Fire Dragon Priest had once blocked the entrance to the Luoshui Pit, truly unable to deal with the ancient water god’s summer palace that had already been refined by the plump old woman. He had sent a talisman sword to Yu Xuan, asking that old Daoist to hurry and assist him in opening the door, promising to split the spoils afterward. At that time, Yu Xuan had replied with a talisman dragon of clouds and water, claiming he was in a critical life-and-death situation daily and couldn’t spare a moment.

That talisman dragon had just exhausted its spiritual energy outside the Luoshui Pit’s entrance, revealing its true form as a green bamboo staff covered in talismans. Once the Fire Dragon Priest left the Luoshui Pit with the bamboo staff and calculated the time, he felt something was off; the timing didn’t add up. Moreover, the life-and-death tribulations of a peak ascendant were perilous, leaving no leisure to reply to messages. The Fire Dragon Priest changed his mind and didn’t return directly to the North Ailu Continent. It wasn’t until he returned to the Central Divine Continent that he learned the old Daoist was attending the Qingshen Mountain banquet in the Bamboo Sea cave.

This time, Yu Xuan traveled alone to Fuyou Continent, not only using talismans to break through three layers of heavenly restrictions but also temporarily creating three great doors. Of course, Yu Xuan aimed to ensure his freedom of movement while seeking an opportunity to possibly take Bai Ye along.

Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the battlefield, all the talismans shattered simultaneously, and the three doors collapsed instantly. Yu Xuan groaned in despair. It was truly unfortunate; he felt trapped.

Bai Ye chuckled, “That’s not like the usual style of Yu Xuan. I appreciate the sentiment, but the matter of spiritual energy is not an issue.”

Yu Xuan, known for his unwillingness to engage in life-or-death battles, preferred exchanges of techniques. He would first ensure he was in an invulnerable position, then merely utilize others’ stones to attack jade, learning from the art of talismans. When he encountered someone of similar level, he almost never resorted to overly domineering techniques. If there was no life-and-death involved, he wouldn’t harm relationships. In contrast, if someone was incapable of matching his Dao, death would render any notion of good relations moot.

Yu Xuan, too, was unaware of Bai Ye’s profound understanding of the Dao in the fourteenth realm.

He could only nod.

The short old man, who monopolized the talismans of the world, now hovered about a hundred miles from Bai Ye. With his hands forming seals, a heavenly phenomenon resembling the movements of the sun, moon, and stars unfolded around him, with fireflies trailing behind, creating a celestial display.

If he got too close to Bai Ye, he might inadvertently distract him from wielding his sword. With Bai Ye facing six opponents, every moment counted; the slightest misstep could lead to a world of difference. Yu Xuan couldn’t afford to make a trip across continents only to distract Bai Ye.

However, if he was too far away, he couldn’t exactly consider himself a transcendent figure capable of offering assistance.

Beneath the white-haired old man in purple robes, a black-and-white Taiji diagram appeared, with the old man remaining still while the diagram slowly rotated beneath him. Occasionally, sparks flew, crackling into faint green smoke, indicating the intricate and secretive methods of Wen Hai Zhou Mi, who had manipulated the spiritual energy of this continent, inadvertently revealing some clues to Yu Xuan’s Taiji diagram.

The principles of yin and yang, of ancient and modern, of life and death—all were manifest in the Taiji diagram.

Of course, this was much grander than the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Once this diagram emerged, it was no mere technique of Yu Xuan’s; it was a trump card even beyond the "Supporting the Mountain's Waist" technique.

It wouldn’t hinder Bai Ye from wielding his Taibai sword to slay demons, and it would allow Bai Ye to take a few steps back to safely absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

As Bai Ye drew his sword, he still had the energy to speak to Yu Xuan, “It’s not too late to leave now.”

Bai Ye held the immortal sword Taibai in one hand and the sword sheath behind him in the other.

Yu Xuan glanced at the sword sheath, then looked up at the sky, shaking his head. “Forget it, forget it. Now that I’m here, I’ll act as the situation demands. It wouldn’t sit right with me to leave without making a move. Just focus on your fight; don’t worry about me. My self-preservation skills are still adequate.”

In truth, Yu Xuan could have left earlier, but he hesitated. The three talisman doors broke apart too quickly, making him miss the only opportunity to sidestep and retreat thousands of miles away.

Of course, this would have required Bai Ye to escort him with his sword; otherwise, the six royal beasts would never allow Yu Xuan to come and go as he pleased. If Bai Ye didn’t offer his sword, Yu Xuan, known for his meticulousness, might suffer losses time and again, possibly even drop in rank.

Yu Xuan stroked his beard, squinting as he continued to observe the battlefield, planning to carefully probe the foundational paths of the six royal beasts.

Seeing Bai Ye strike again and again, each time merely raising and lowering his sword, a beam of sword light illuminated the sky for miles around. Even Yu Xuan felt a shiver of awe—what a sight to behold, a sword that broke through myriad laws.

Unfortunately, Bai Ye was not a sword cultivator and did not possess a life-bound flying sword.

Yet, Yu Xuan thought to himself, the Heavenly Dao dislikes fullness; even so, Bai Ye, this scholarly figure, was already enough to leave a mark throughout history.

Bai Ye extended his sword, driving back the colossal figure of Yuan Shou. The old ape's long staff was struck by the brilliant sword light, sending sparks flying as if a divine soldier was forging a sword mold, scattering starlight that ignited countless landscapes.

Yuan Shou’s massive body slid back hundreds of miles, roaring in anger. He stomped his foot in the void, causing ripples to splash like thunder in the air, even stirring the waters of the River of Time.

Yuan Shou swung his staff, the force tremendous enough to bend the staff into a bow.

Bai Ye struck again, shattering the gust of wind created by Yuan Shou’s staff, causing tornadoes to spin across the heavens.

Yuan Shou released his hold, regripping the staff; it clashed with the sword light, buzzing with resonance. Just the reverberation from the staff was enough to shatter nearby treasures.

Yuan Shou glanced at his palm, filled with white bones. Although they regenerated almost instantly, it was still quite vexing. In the wild world, he was renowned for his combat prowess over countless battles throughout millennia; he had never felt this constrained.

As for the other royal monsters, one of them, Yang Zhi, harnessed his life-bound artifact, the Dragon Palace Water Mansion, swiftly gliding through the winds, revealing countless ethereal water spirits, resembling a magnificent escort.

With this artifact, he drew closer to Bai Ye and summoned another life-bound object, suddenly descending upon Bai Ye.

Yu Xuan furrowed his brows, looking up. This woman’s background was impressive; she truly was one of the peak royals of the wild world, possessing nothing but good treasures.

The item summoned by Yang Zhi was a style of ancient jade that had been abolished for thousands of years by Bai Yu Jing, engraved with inscriptions on all four sides, displaying radiant hues of red, blue, white, and yellow. The foremost side bore the inscription “The First Month’s New Moon,” while the others read “The Sharpness of Swords and Sabers Cannot Be Used,” “Exorcising Spirits and Commanding the Dragon to Control Water,” and “The Essence of One Item Holds the Great Dao.”

This item was not only an ancient relic but also a six-fold law seal refined and completed by Yang Zhi, with the heavenly inscription reading “Azure Sky” and the earthly inscription reading “Yellow Springs.”

Once this seal emerged, it exuded overwhelming heavenly might.

The Bai Yu law seal spun as it fell, carrying the imposing presence of a celestial facing impending tribulation.

Particularly, the inscription “The Sharpness of Swords and Sabers Cannot Be Used” inherently suppressed sword cultivators and their swords. The inscriptions glimmered brightly, shimmering with ancient seals, dispersing into the surroundings.

As a result, Bai Ye was unable to cleave through the law seal with his sword, and instead, his majestic sword energy was partially absorbed, causing the seal to descend with even greater force.

Bai Ye did not entangle himself too much with the descending law seal; as it swiftly descended within three thousand zhang, he simply offered a second sword strike towards Yang Zhi.

One sword cut across the crown atop Yang Zhi’s dragon-like head, severing the twelve colorful silk threads connecting the jeweled tassels, all of which Bai Ye sliced through. As Yang Zhi reached out to catch the falling pearls, his thoughts shifted, and the life-bound object was restored to its original state. However, to compensate for the damage caused by Bai Ye’s sword, countless flying deities, all remarkably beautiful and indistinguishable in gender, emerged from the seams of his dragon robe, only to turn to ash, hundreds at a time.

Yang Zhi had presided over the Yueluo River for thousands of years, during which he had meticulously refined three hundred court dancers, all elegant and graceful. He had refined a total of one thousand eight hundred standing dancers, adorned in splendid attire, their colors radiant and their movements enchanting.

Additionally, there were sixteen thousand court maidens of the Yueluo River, each responsible for mending the dragon robe and crown.

Yang Zhi was unwilling to distance himself too far from the law seal, nor did he believe he could truly subdue Bai Ye. Even with the mountain-sized law seal looming over him, merely a few hundred zhang separated it from Bai Ye’s sword.

In the end, he had no choice but to retract the law seal and nurture it within his life’s core.

Bai Ye’s earlier strike had created a crack in the six-fold law seal, which could naturally refine sword energy. Not only could it repair the crack, but Yang Zhi could also use this opportunity to derive Bai Ye’s Dao.

Bai Ye smiled and said, “Spirits of essence are adept at manipulating heavenly mechanisms; be wary of sinking souls in the Northern Fengdu.”

Upon hearing this, Yu Xuan stroked his beard and laughed, finding Bai Ye’s words quite profound.

Yang Zhi’s expression changed slightly as she pressed her hand against her temple, then tightened her grip on the law seal. Her wrist trembled slightly as she struggled to stabilize the life-bound object.

Looking at her hand, the side inscribed with “Swords and Sabers” had become utterly shattered, directly damaged by the residual sword energy from Bai Ye, signifying that from now on, she had lost a life-bound divine ability and could no longer rely on this ancient law seal to suppress the sword cultivators of the Vast World.

Fortunately, the other five sides remained intact.

Yang Zhi’s face was expressionless, harboring deep hatred within. She regretted asking Bai Ye about “the sword”; no matter the route, she shouldn’t have been so presumptuous.

Yu Xuan seemed to have an insight.

With each sword strike, Bai Ye appeared to deliberately avoid striving to kill the royal seats outright.

This was indeed intriguing.

Could it be that he aimed to reduce the six royal seats to mere ascendant beasts? To make some of them, once at their peak, revert to ordinary ascendant monsters?

Yu Xuan surveyed the surroundings; in every corner of the heavens, there were talismans Yu Xuan had quietly deployed to uphold the balance of heaven and earth. This not only allowed him to accurately examine the flow of heavenly time but also slightly resist the increasingly oppressive forces of the heavens and earth closing in.

Yu Xuan certainly wouldn’t just watch Bai Ye display his sword skills; the three layers of heavenly restrictions were gradually converging, tightening step by step, like a fishing net being drawn in. As the spiritual energy of heaven and earth became increasingly sparse and thin, it also favored the royal monsters’ timing, which would become more concentrated. According to Yu Xuan’s calculations, once the three overlapping nets ultimately shrank to a thousand miles, it wouldn’t be surprising if even the River of Time manifested, and in the long run, Bai Ye would truly face a dead end. This proud figure of the mortal realm, wielding his sword, was indeed on a road of no return.

Before Bai Ye could inquire further, Yu Xuan smiled knowingly, “Just focus on wielding your sword; I won’t be a bother.”

Bai Ye lightly nodded, shaking his wrist gently. A beam of sword light, bright as autumn waters, suddenly appeared.

Centered around Bai Ye in his green robe, a massive mirror of sword light manifested in the air, composed entirely of condensed sword energy.

It seemed as if the heavens had opened, with a sword offering a distant salute to Wen Hai Zhou Mi.

However, this sword light was supposed to cleave through the old man behind Bai Ye, yet upon passing through the Taiji diagram, it bent and twisted, ultimately completely circumventing Yu Xuan.

The old man, relying on a single hand, was already astonishingly extraordinary.

Yu Xuan, standing firm within the grand formation, remained motionless, allowing Bai Ye’s sword to miss its mark.

Yu Xuan stroked his beard and laughed, appreciating Bai Ye’s peak performance; it was grand and free-spirited.

Avoiding this strike was merely a fortunate coincidence. As long as he could leave Fuyou Continent alive this time, he wouldn’t need to say much about such matters. A visit to a certain sword sect that shamelessly hung Bai Ye’s portrait in their ancestral hall, sipping a few cups of tea, chatting casually would suffice. It was amusing how they hung Bai Ye’s portrait despite having nothing to do with him; they dreamed of becoming part of the ancestral hall’s legacy, yet they expected the sword cultivators to chant Bai Ye’s poems three hundred times in one breath. Who would believe that?

As for the six enormous royal monsters, each suffering from their true forms being severed and split in half.

The three unfortunate monsters that had been sliced by the sword light quickly regained their original forms, each injuring a bit of their vitality, having used their life-bound artifacts to block the attack, which still failed to shake the foundation of the Dao.

Yuan Shou picked up his tilted head and reattached it to his neck.

Yang Zhi’s dragon tail fell hundreds of zhang before rejoining with her upper body.

The six-armed royal beast had its legs severed at the knees, but it didn’t care.

As for the remaining three royal beasts, their imposing forms restored even quicker.

Qie Yun stood on the shoulder of his golden form; as the golden light scattered in all directions, his mind stirred, and his golden body was remade.

Among the six royals, Qie Yun was the most laid-back one. Even now, he had the leisure to examine the unexpected guest, Yu Xuan. Especially the life-bound gourd at the old man's waist, which made Qie Yun’s eyes glimmer with envy.

Yu Xuan clicked his tongue in wonder; these royal monsters could indeed fight and endure, each one more brazen than the last.
The relentless clash between the realms of the human and the wild had reached a fever pitch. Each of the mighty beings withstood the assault of Bai Ye's sword, a blade capable of severing both true forms and avatars with ease. In the world of the Ascended, known as the Haoran Realm, no one would dare confront such power head-on; the resilience of human cultivators simply could not match that of the savage beasts from the Barbaric Lands.

Under normal circumstances, a typical Ascended beast from the wild—be it in its true form or as an avatar—would have been forced to retreat and recover after suffering a blow from a sword like Bai Ye's. Yet here were figures like Yuan Shou and Yang Zhi, who thrived in the heat of battle, growing ever bolder.

The elder couldn't help but sigh. The Sword Qi Great Wall had stood for millennia, enduring countless sieges and battles every century. How much had it suffered in that time?

Yet Chen Qingdu's temperament was known to be irrationally fierce. It was said that in days gone by, when the Dao Ancestor rode a cow through the gates, Chen Qingdu had hardly glanced in his direction, dismissing a certain royal beast with a casual slap that sent it back to the depths of an ancient well. Chen Qingdu had similarly ignored the aftermath. Later, when Dao Lao Er finally ventured from Bai Yu Jing to the Haoran Realm, capturing a beast of the Ascended, it was rumored that Chen Qingdu nearly broke his own rules and drew his sword from atop the city walls. Only then did Dao Lao Er leave behind the grandest mountain seal in existence, the Upside-down Mountain.

The fact that Dao Lao Er had to suppress his anger and refrain from striking was largely due to Chen Qingdu and the old scholar. The truth of the matter had become a mystery, one that future generations might never unravel, no matter how much they pored over ancient texts.

It was all so similar.

Just like the actions of many talismans and the enigmatic figures of yore, they mirrored the myriad unsolved riddles of the current Haoran Realm.

Which great cultivator standing atop a mountain peak had not left behind a tapestry of stories and footprints for the world to ponder?

Take, for instance, the small national mountain in the Lixia Continent, which remained suspended in the air for six hundred years, upheld by a talisman cast by Yu Xuan. The talisman still gleamed with vitality, showing no signs of dissipated spiritual energy or broken talisman seals.

It was said that this suspension was a consequence of that particular mountain lord's capricious behavior, inadvertently angering Yu Xuan during his travels through the region. As punishment, Yu Xuan made it clear that until the mountain lord came to the gates to acknowledge his mistakes, the mountain would remain suspended.

In truth, the mountain lord had attempted to visit Yu Xuan before but found the elder deliberately absent, waiting at the mountain gates for years, only to return empty-handed.

Even though a national mountain lord had fewer restrictions than a mountain god or land deity, the challenges of journeying across continents were immense. To traverse the seas and distances involved was no small feat. The mountain lord had to endure countless hardships, borrowing and seeking help from the spirits of nature, before finally arriving at the gates of Yu Xuan, only to discover the master was far away, entirely unaware of when he might return. Yu Xuan, it seemed, had no intention of seeing the mountain lord.

After years of waiting and serving as a gatekeeper for the mountain, the mountain lord eventually left, having bowed his head in submission. Throughout the ordeal, he never once considered crashing into the gates in anger, a testament to his restraint.

There were also those cultivators on the mountains who were at odds with the Daoist talismans and held grievances against Yu Xuan, criticizing him for being too unyielding and arrogant, for relying on his status to bully a small national mountain lord. If Yu Xuan was truly the best at mastering talismans, why not prove it against the likes of the Suishan? What merit was there in picking on a mere mountain lord from another continent?

As for why that mountain remained suspended for six hundred years despite the severed roots, and how the mountain lord's divine statue remained secure while the spiritual energy of the land showed no signs of waning, those observing the spectacle hardly paid attention to such trivialities. Meanwhile, the once-mighty mountain lord had changed his domineering ways, diligently fortifying the spiritual energy of his territory, never allowing himself to be lax, which only made the situation more mundane.

The affairs of the world were as numerous as the hairs on a cow. While it was unlikely that anyone would truly die, what was being extinguished were the youthful spirits.

Bai Ye, much like Yu Xuan, seemed to possess a premonition of the situation, smiling as he remarked, "To plan this way is indeed true, and it is also true that the throne is not easily slain. I need to draw my sword to find the method of resolving the sacrificial death."

The Celestial Sword Taibai, sharp beyond compare, would not fall into the hands of mere mortals. No matter how many times Bai Ye wielded his sword, it would hold no meaning if it did not strike true.

At least one of the royal beasts was, in some sense, an immortal body. Before arriving in the Haoran Realm, it had likely received permission from the Grand Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain or the meticulous Wen Hai, allowing it to secretly merge with the Barbaric Lands. Or perhaps it was tied to some yet-to-be-revealed robe or armor, intertwined with the vast landscapes of the Barbaric Lands. Regardless of the scenario, it meant that Bai Ye, despite being capable of slaying a royal beast with a single strike, could only shatter mountains and rivers in some remote corner of the Barbaric Lands. Thus, Yuan Shou's apparent desire for death and the so-called life-exchange were all deliberate ploys.

This was the most troublesome aspect.

The disputes over techniques atop the mountain were already treacherous and convoluted, and the struggles at the peak only served to confound further.

Yu Xuan was deeply troubled.

If these royal beasts were this difficult to kill, was there truly an even more mysterious method of sacrificial death, one even more cryptic than my own?

Was this the vile method of that damned Jia Sheng?

Yu Xuan glanced at the face of the woman, now stitched together, known as Qie Yun, and asked with a smile, "One-on-one?"

Qie Yun quickly waved her hands with a bright smile, "At Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan, we kill with a celestial aura. I dare not challenge you alone; I only dare to collect the corpses."

Yu Xuan couldn't help but regret coming here.

Had he known Bai Ye would wield his sword with such astonishment, he wouldn't have come to join the commotion. He could neither help nor leave; it was a bind he did not wish to be in. It was an embarrassing situation, lacking any semblance of heroic spirit.

Yu Xuan couldn't help but ask, "What should we do?"

Bai Ye smiled and replied, "Just draw the sword."

As the restrictions across the continents grew tighter, the world itself felt smaller.

Bai Ye remained oblivious.

In the next moment, Yu Xuan sighed, "I always thought Bai Ye, being at the top of the Ten of Central Plains, was without question, but the gap between Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan and Bai Ye should not be too vast. I never imagined that upon seeing him today, I would realize how mistaken I was."

Deliberately setting aside the rankings of the Confucian Temple's Three Saints in the Haoran Realm's Central Plains, each mountain likely had its own opinions on specifics. However, it was nearly universally agreed that Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan ranked among the top five, if not sixth. There was hardly any dissent on this matter. Even the Lord of Bai Di City and the martial goddess Pei Bei fluctuated in their ranks, constantly sparking debates that could earn the mountain's report a fortune in divine currency.

As for the Ten of Haoran, the arguments surrounding the rankings were entirely nebulous.

For example, the sword-cultivator sects often liked to include A Liang and his companions among the ranks, particularly in the case of North Ju Lu Continent, where they would almost prefer that apart from the Three Saints—Zhi Sheng, Li Sheng, and Ya Sheng—only their own Fire Dragon True Person would be included, with the remaining six being sword immortals. Bai Ye, while not a sword cultivator, wielded Taibai, and even as an outsider, his ranking could not be lower than fourth. The Grand Master of Longhu Mountain was also included, as he wielded a sword, counting him as half an insider. Additionally, there was A Liang from the Ya Sheng lineage and the left and right from the Wen Sheng lineage—one undefeated in battle and the other unparalleled in swordsmanship—both deserving of their rankings. As for Zhou Shen Zhi of the Central Plains, he was begrudgingly considered, at least as a proper sword cultivator… The old sword immortal Zhou Shen Zhi had once turned red in the face over this matter, almost flying across the continent on his sword to scold and slay people in North Ju Lu. It was said that the widely circulated and immensely popular mountain report had cost the Elder of the Huan Family a pretty penny.

It wasn’t that Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan was self-deprecating, but rather that Bai Ye’s swordplay was too flamboyant, too extraordinary.

For instance, at this very moment, Bai Ye split the heavens and the earth into six with his heart.

A single leaf boat, departing from Bai Di amidst colorful clouds. Yuan Shou felt a twinge of doubt, glancing around, unsure how he ended up standing on the edge of a cliff.

Bai Ye, clad in white as pure as snow, stood on that single leaf boat and struck down at Yuan Shou with his sword.

In the West, there was a path for Taibai’s birds, capable of crossing the peaks of Emei. Bai Ye wielded his sword, stepping forth from the mountain's moon, severing Qie Yun.

The great waterfall cascaded down three thousand feet, transforming into a sword that cleaved down upon the Five Peaks.

The birds flew away, the lone cloud drifted lazily, and amidst the high pavilion, the blue-clad sword immortal descended, striking down upon the great beast, Yang Zhi, in the water.

The long winds stretched for miles, the autumn geese departed far, and high above, the sword light chased the golden-armored divine being.

On a battlefield long forgotten, where iron-clad warriors lay shattered and bones piled high, Bai Ye struck down upon Bai Ying.

Beyond that was where Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan resided, still hundreds of miles away from Bai Ye.

Strangely enough, today marked the first time Yu Xuan and Bai Ye had encountered each other up close. Previously, they had only passed each other at a distance, having exchanged not even a single word.

Soon after Bai Ye achieved his most triumphant statement, he closed the mountain and the sword, shutting himself away for many years on a solitary island, accompanied only by books and the sea.

Historically, some great cultivators, disbelieving in fate, sought to explore and uncover how a man, not even a sword cultivator, could command such a rebellious celestial sword.

However, the outcomes were seldom favorable. The best luck was finding no trace of the restrictions, while those who did often encountered only the sword light and returned home, tail between their legs.

Yu Xuan chuckled and asked, "The Celestial Sword Taibai, does it truly have a sword spirit that can take human form?"

Bai Ye nodded, "It can. But Taibai prefers to remain hidden."

Yu Xuan laughed heartily, "You've cleared a major doubt from my mind!"

There have always been rumors that the four famed celestial swords of the world harbored a sword spirit, able to manifest a human form through the sword path and accompany their master. The power of a sword spirit equates to that of an Ascended sword cultivator. Thus, possessing a celestial sword essentially meant having a fellow sword cultivator of the Ascended realm by one’s side. However, Yu Xuan had never seen the forms of the four sword spirits personally. His old friend, Fire Dragon True Person, who served as the outer sect Grand Master of Longhu Mountain, had only claimed to have seen the sword spirit twice, but its form varied—once appearing as a young disciple with a talisman and once as a sword-wielding female attendant.

Yu Xuan was half-convinced, for Fire Dragon True Person had a reputation for deceiving those closest to him. Just a few years ago, when he had encountered setbacks at the Grand Master’s residence, he took a young disciple named Zhang Shan Feng with him on his travels through the Central Plains. 

The master and disciple did not ascend the mountain; Fire Dragon True Person simply told Yu Xuan to stay below to entertain guests, claiming his disciple was too timid. 

The boy, whether naive or overly confident, had learned Yu Xuan's name and, with a sincere expression, almost said out loud that the elder's luck was poor, being misfortunate enough to share a name with Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan, which surely brought ridicule during his time studying on the mountain.

The three celestial swords, including Taibai, were renowned. Each appearance of these swords would shake the heavens.

For example, Bai Ye cleaved through the cave sky, with the waters of the Yellow River flowing from the heavens. Or, Dao Lao Er wielding a sword, challenging the entire Daxuan Daoist Temple, personally slaying a prodigy from the Qingming Realm.

There was also the current Grand Master of Longhu Mountain, the youngest to inherit the title in history, who descended the mountain with a sword at a tender age, having traversed the world for a century, spanning the Haoran Six Continents, and consecutively slaying eleven top-tier demons of the Ascended realm, causing all evils to retreat from Longhu Mountain.

Thus arose the well-known saying, "Wherever demons plague the world, there is the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain."

Only the fourth sword, for thousands of years, had remained unseen. It was said that one of the nine great towers in Nan Po Sha Continent was built to suppress this sword, meant to counter the spirit of the sword. There were also claims that it belonged to the Dragon Slayer who emerged three thousand years ago, wielding a long sword, who, after slaying the dragon, carelessly tossed it into the sea.

Occasionally, rumors circulated atop the peaks of the Haoran Realm that a fifth celestial sword might still exist, though its whereabouts remained entirely unknown.

Aside from the celestial sword Taibai borrowed by Bai Ye, its true name was Xuandu, but it was nicknamed Taibai. Once it fell into Bai Ye's hands, the latter's fame overshadowed the former.

At the Grand Master’s residence in Longhu Mountain, one of the talisman's seals, the celestial sword was named Wanfa.

And the sword held by the reputed invincible second pastor of Bai Yu Jing was known as Dao Zang.

Bai Ye turned and smiled, "Not leaving? This is your last chance. Once your Yin Spirit dissipates, along with that life-seed gourd left behind, you won't even be able to stay in the Ascended realm, Old Yu Xuan."

Bai Ye's six realms of heart could not contain the six royal beasts for long.

Yu Xuan was deeply anxious. He could hardly lend significant aid, and he knew staying here could give Bai Ye a sliver of hope.

In truth, he had indeed traveled far with his Yin Spirit, hiding his true self elsewhere, but he had brought all his possessions, including a wine gourd.

Bai Ye raised his sword sheath and said, "Please, Old Yu Xuan, help me return this item to the Grand Master of Xuandu. It is said that Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan has one regret in life: that he never traveled far to Qingming Realm. Bai Ye has little merit to offer, but with this, you could ascend and traverse between the two realms. As for the Taibai sword in my hand, it truly cannot be returned to its rightful owner. Please help me convey my apologies to Daoist Sun."

Once Yu Xuan accepted the Taibai sword sheath, Bai Ye would strike with all his might to slay the six royal beasts, no matter what, he would pave a road for Yu Xuan.

Believing that with Yu Xuan's talisman skills, even if a royal beast tried its hardest to block him, he would still find a way to escape.

Unexpectedly, Yu Xuan shook his head, "Only sending my Yin Spirit far away and giving up half my life to come here is already a sign of my resolve. To back down now would mean losing all my celestial aura."

With unwavering determination, Yu Xuan laughed heartily, "If I am to return the sword sheath, I shall do it myself! I, Yu Xuan, will have a word with that Bai Ying; this fellow is likely the key to the method of sacrificial death. You can draw your sword afterward; I will not interfere."

A peak Ascended being, willing to part with their Yin Spirit and a crucial life item, if that isn’t grand, then it would be a joke of cosmic proportions.

Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan was indeed brimming with celestial aura.

The white-haired, purple-clothed elder, stepping onto the Taiji diagram, vanished in a flash. As Bai Ye's heart realm shattered the heavens above with Bai Ying's impact, the elder slipped through a gap into the inner sanctum, revealing his avatar, his sleeves billowing as he unleashed a torrent of talismans, raining down like snowflakes. He first repelled Bai Ying and the sword attendant back to the battlefield's ruins, then used half of the talismans to stabilize Bai Ye's heart realm, converting it into his own talisman array, while the remaining half of the talismans twisted and turned, creating a myriad of strange forms.

Upon the earth, iron-clad cavalry rallied, charging forth, while in the heavens, celestial maidens scattered flowers.

In addition, hundreds of golden-armored puppets surged forward, their momentum like thunder.

Pavilions and towers shimmered, while talisman-formed white-robed immortals, along with various spells and attacking treasures, descended like rain upon the world.

One of the mysteries atop the Haoran Realm was how many talismans Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan had actually crafted. Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? A million?!

Meanwhile, the royal beast Bai Ying remained trapped within the confines of the Eight Trigrams Formation.

No matter where you stood in the celestial formations of the Fuyou Continent, first with Bai Ye's heart realm, then with the talisman realm, and finally with the Taiji diagram, one by one they were all dispelled!

Bai Ying felt heavy-hearted. If only it were any other of the Ten of Central Plains, it wouldn't be this complicated.

Bai Ying, unwilling to reveal her roots, had no choice but to adopt a strategy akin to that of Symbolic Talismans Yu Xuan, relying on numbers to win, showcasing her powers in a multitude of ways.

With Yu Xuan's multitude of talismans, Bai Ying transformed her robe into that of a skeletal throne, commanding legions of Yin spirits to battle alongside countless talisman puppets across various battlegrounds.

In truth, the entire realm they occupied was a battlefield, both above and below.

Although Yu Xuan was only entangling one royal beast, it significantly lightened Bai Ye's burden.

For one, Bai Ying was likely the key backup set by Jia Sheng. Moreover, throughout Bai Ye's life, whether in the zenith of his sword prowess or the decline of his poetic inspiration, he had never relied on others. Therefore, this battle marked the first time Bai Ye fought alongside someone.

Besides Bai Ying, the other five royal beasts had already escaped, each revealing towering avatars, while the final remnants of spiritual energy crazily coalesced in five locations.

In the world, a continent's spiritual energy had already been nearly exhausted.
The six thrones either used their life artifacts to control the situation or were swallowed by the likes of Bai Yingyun, Yangzhi Longpao, and Qieyun Yangjian Hu. As the five sword formations descended, they once again tightly imprisoned Yangzhi and the other four thrones within.

Bai Ye’s poetry was unmatched. Only when the verses in his heart had been completely exhausted did his spirit and energy falter. Until then, his poetry was invincible, and his swordsmanship even more so. Bai Ye, the true Sword Immortal, had surely outshone countless sword cultivators.

In the realm of Qingming, at the Baiyu Capital (Baiyu Jing), five cities and twelve towers loomed, a sight unparalleled across the land. Immortals rode whales back to the city or soared through the skies on yellow cranes. There were ancient sages on high platforms, lost in their own forms, while intricate patterns of Dao undulated like ripples outside the towers. In the city, venerable immortals gathered clouds of purple above their heads, forming crests that rivaled the Five Mountains. Furthermore, the finest materials for cultivation were abundant in Qingming, and in the depths of the night, spirits roamed Baiyu Capital, visiting the five cities and twelve towers, where immortals might bestow azure clasps and jade tablets or grant longevity techniques.

Now, the Second Dao Lord held court in Baiyu Capital. The third sect master, Lu Chen, was responsible for dealing with the relentless outer realm demons in the Celestial Beyond. However, Lu Chen often sneaked back to Baiyu Capital.

The Second Dao Lord, a tall middle-aged man, paid no mind to Lu Chen’s mischief. He frowned and asked, “Bai Ye once devoted himself to the Dao; why don't you take action?”

Behind the Second Dao Lord, a long sword trembled slightly, as if responding to the celestial sword Taibai that was separated from them by an entire realm.

Leaning over the railing, Lu Chen chuckled, “I don’t wish for Baiyu Capital to gain another tedious immortal, nor do I want my hometown to lose its most esteemed figure. How does that answer suit you, brother?” 

The Second Dao Lord remained silent.

After a moment of quiet, Lu Chen suddenly laughed and cursed, “That Daoist Sun really lacks decorum; I’ll go to the entrance of the Daxuandu Temple and scold him later.” Earlier, Daoist Sun had appeared outside Baiyu Capital without a glance at the highest point and had simply remarked, “Oh, so Baiyu Capital does have true immortals.”

In the Central Land of the Haoran World, at the Longhu Mountain Tianshi (Celestial Master) Estate, a young daoist with a face like jade stood atop a Star Snatching Platform, calculating with his fingers concealed within his sleeves. Dressed in the distinctive robe of the Tianshi Estate, adorned with swirling yellow and purple energies, he was known as the Feathered Robe Minister, a figure renowned throughout the realm.

A young sword-wielding attendant appeared out of thin air on the Star Snatching Platform. The young daoist turned and bowed, while the young attendant stood casually with one hand behind his back, facing the current Grand Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain, executing a one-handed sword gesture to return the salute.

In the fifth realm, Ascension City.

Ning Yao pressed her hand against her forehead.

On the golden arched bridge, a tall woman sat with a sword resting on her knees, gently coiling her dark hair. 

Was she a spirit attendant? 

Of course not. The sword spirit was something she had refined herself; to be precise, the sword spirit had always been her, and she was never merely a sword spirit.

She preferred that no one knew this truth. Even the old man Yang, who had been the first to withdraw from the battlefield, couldn’t guess the reality. Qi Jingchun, with his gentlemanly demeanor, didn’t wish to delve too deeply into the matter and remained equally unaware.

Only that once-young “Liu Sixteen,” whom she had pulled into this place, managed to deduce some clues, yet even then it wasn’t the full truth. Liu Sixteen harbored doubts about the “sword attendant being dead.”

When she journeyed to the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Qingdu was fully aware of her identity, but given the significance of the situation, he didn’t know how this senior felt, so he had to play dumb to assist her in deceiving Chen Pingan. Even when she told him to keep his distance, Chen Qingdu could only hold his nose and genuinely step back.

If she were merely one of the sword spirits akin to the four celestial swords, she wouldn't be worthy of being called "senior" by Chen Qingdu.

Ten thousand years ago, one of the five supreme deities of the Heavenly Court, the Sword Bearer, wielded a power unmatched by others. 

Conquering the heavens and earth, she amassed the corpses of deities and earth demons beneath her blade, forming mountains of defeat. 

Even the various blessed lands and cave heavens, including the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, were shattered by her sword strikes, reduced to fragments of the world.

Later, the Fire God commanded the messenger of the Comet and joined forces with the Water God to gather the essence of heaven and earth, forging four swords that imitated the blade of this deity.

Subsequently, swordsmanship descended into the mortal realm, branching into four lineages, appearing in shadows and light, extending endlessly. Apart from the lineage of the Sword Qi Great Wall led by Chen Qingdu, there were also lineages from the Longhu Mountain Tianshi Estate, the Daxuandu Temple’s Daoist Sword Immortals, and another from the Lotus Flower Buddha Kingdom.

Among them, the damaged celestial sword taken by Chen Qingdu to the Sword Qi Great Wall was not suitable for extensive use, hence it had quietly awaited its master’s return for ten thousand years. Eventually, after such a long wait, it was finally gifted to Ning Yao by Chen Qingdu, or perhaps it was the sword spirit that had actively chosen Ning Yao. This was also the reason why Ning Yao was able to stand out so remarkably on the path of swordsmanship at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Thus, when Ning Yao traveled to the Lizhu Cave Heaven, she was determined to open her heavenly eye at the center of her forehead and unveil this sword. At that time, she wished to see who would inherit the sword techniques she had personally imparted to the mortal Chen Qingdu ten thousand years later.

In the past, during a riverside discussion, the old scholar revealed the scroll of the River of Time, and she was the one standing farthest away.

As for why she willingly taught sword techniques to the human race and stood with them in the same camp, who knows? In her eyes, the many deities from back then were just ants.

So, three thousand years ago, during the dragon-slaying battle that forged the Lizhu Cave Heaven, she still found it laughable, as if it were a child's game.

Because she was not just a sword spirit.

Above and below the heavens,

She was the Sword Master.

 **Chapter 850: True Invincibility**

Dao Lao Er wore a robe of law, a celestial sword strapped to his back, and a fish-tail crown perched upon his head. Next to him, his junior brother Lu Chen lay lazily on the railing, adorned with a lotus crown, while a goldfinch rested on his shoulder.

In the past, the Grand Master of Bai Yu Jing (White Jade Capital) was the first disciple of the Dao Ancestor, donning a Ruyi crown and bearing a Taoist talisman. The reason he could accept disciples on behalf of his master was naturally due to his recent closeness with the Dao Ancestor.

At this moment, the celestial sword on Dao Lao Er's back trembled incessantly, emitting rays of light from its sheath. Golden clouds, manifestations of the Great Dao, appeared one after the other. Yet, as soon as the golden characters emerged from the sheath, they were immediately bound by the immense and almost tangible Dao laws emanating from Dao Lao Er. The contents of the Daoist scriptures and treasured texts could only flicker in existence, like countless fish swimming in a stream, their lives and deaths forever trapped in the waters. Occasionally, a fish would leap from the water, but it would merely catch a fleeting glimpse of the sky before plummeting back down.

Lu Chen teased, “Senior Brother, with that much killing intent, you'd better be careful or you might provoke the Great Xuan Du Temple to activate their sword formation. They might come asking for a duel at Bai Yu Jing. Our friend Daoist Sun has been patient with you for quite some time. Luckily, I found a little junior brother for you; otherwise, gathering five hundred Spirit Officials would have dragged on for years, maybe three hundred years at most, or at least a hundred years—definitely not ideal.”

Dao Lao Er didn't respond directly. The long-standing grievances between Bai Yu Jing and Great Xuan Du Temple were old hat and lacked interest. As for the matter of the five hundred Spirit Officials returning to the celestial ranks, it was only a matter of time. When the time came, after two hundred years, he would lead the five hundred Spirit Officials to wage war against the outer demons. Those extraterrestrial fiends would suffer significant injuries, and the five hundred Spirit Officials would become even more legitimate.

Regarding those outer demons, who seemed impossible to eradicate completely, the three branches of Bai Yu Jing had long had their differences. Dao Lao Er's branch simply favored killing. Apart from suppressing the outer demons and preventing some formidable fiends from growing stronger, Dao Lao Er also intended to personally wield his sword across the world, leading the five hundred Spirit Officials to spend five hundred years specifically slaying the heart demons of the Qi Refiners. His goal was to render those countless outer demons into a source-less water, a rootless tree, ultimately forcing them to merge into three. At that point, he and his two senior brothers would each suppress one, bringing peace to the world.

This feat would eclipse even the legendary slaying of the true dragons by a certain someone in the Haoran World.

As for the junior brother Daoist Shan Qing, Dao Lao Er had a lukewarm impression of him—neither particularly good nor bad, just passable. The only thing that caught Dao Lao Er's eye was that Shan Qing dared to take initiative in that new world, willing to undertake matters that even the Dao Ancestor's closed-door disciples would shy away from.

Currently, Shan Qing had made the once-dominant power of Bai Yu Jing increasingly isolated, transforming it into a lone mountain in the Fifth Realm, forming a confrontation with all other sects. It was precisely because of this that Dao Lao Er found it somewhat commendable.

The figure praised as "True Invincible," the second Grand Master of Bai Yu Jing, merely sneered, “I’ve wanted to sever the head of that throne-dwelling bull for quite some time now.”

Years ago, their master had intentionally spared its life, binding it with a golden armor manifested from a seed of Dao, forcing it to accumulate a bit of spiritual light through cultivation. When the time came, it would be free to roam the vastness of the world, perhaps becoming a ruler in the wild lands, and thereby cultivating for ten thousand years, nearing immortality. Who would have thought that such an ungrateful being, lacking in appreciation for its fortune, would resort to base tactics, attempting to use Bai Yu's sword to break through the Dao armor—a true waste of heaven's gifts. Such a dullard had the audacity to visit Bai Yu Jing?

Regardless of Dao Lao Er's temper, in a certain sense, he was indeed more aligned with the secular meaning of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao than his two brothers.

“Regarding the matters of the Haoran World, I advise you not to get involved,” Lu Chen said lazily. “Wasn’t the founding ancestor of the military unmatched back in the day? Yet, he ended up as a corpse divided into five pieces, meeting his end at the hands of those he considered ants?”

Aside from the corpse becoming an object of contention, after the military ancestor's demise, his spirit was entirely merged into the martial providence of the world, paving a path to the heavens for future martial artists. This was also why, across the various realms, they never deliberately manipulated the martial providence. That military ancestor had achievements in the heavens yet bore the sin of dividing humanity—his merits and faults did not offset each other. His great merits remained as such, yet he was still destined to face punishment for ten thousand years.

As for the five Qi Refiners who had divided the corpse back in the ancient battlefield, at that time, their realms were not particularly high. One had taken the lead in claiming the head, while the remaining four each took their share—a historical footnote referred to as “joint beheading.”

A young Taoist boy soared into the air from one of the five cities of Bai Yu Jing, Qing Cui City, hovering above the clouds. He bowed respectfully upwards, not daring to act recklessly or ascend on his own.

Qing Cui City, as one of the five cities of Bai Yu Jing, was located at the northernmost point. According to Daoist Sun of Great Xuan Du Temple, the name Qing Cui City came from the saying “Jade Emperor plums are indeed crisp,” akin to the Dao Ancestor planting a gourd vine that transformed into seven sword-nurturing gourds. Of course, the residents of Qing Cui City would never admit to such an explanation, dismissing it as nonsense.

However, within the internal hierarchy of Bai Yu Jing, Qing Cui City was indeed known by the alternate title of Jade Emperor City. Qing Cui City governed seventy-two lands in the Qing Ming realm, including two of the ten great cave heavens and thirty-six minor cave heavens, three blessed lands, and six dynasties. Moreover, the mountain and valley Taoist temples were countless. Every sixty years, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, the lord of Qing Cui City would summon a ceremonial procession to inspect the merits and faults of the various dynasties' officials, assessing the mountain gods and spirits. The areas traversed by the procession were all subject to evaluation, not limited to just the city’s borders.

Thus, Qing Cui City held significant power despite its lowly position among the twelve floors of Bai Yu Jing's five cities.

The reason for this city's extraordinary status stemmed from the Grand Master of Bai Yu Jing having spent an extensive period in cultivation there, often teaching the Dao to the world. Regardless of whether they were disciples of Bai Yu Jing or human officials, or even spirits and ghosts from the mountains and rivers, all could enter the city to seek guidance, making Qing Cui City a place renowned for fostering good relations with the world.

Lu Chen waved his hand with a smile, calling out, “Yun Sheng, why the formalities? Come here!” Only then did the young Taoist boy approach the highest point of Bai Yu Jing, landing gracefully in the corridor and bowing once more to the two Grand Masters, not daring to overstep the rules. 

In Bai Yu Jing, the rules were few. When the Grand Master managed Bai Yu Jing or indeed the entire Qing Ming realm, he truly practiced non-interference, even the significant Daoist places like Great Xuan Du Temple and the Yearly Sacrifice Palace were in agreement. Even Lu Chen, once a disciple of the Dao Ancestor, was seen as a natural choice to govern Bai Yu Jing. The world may have been filled with disputes and chaos, but they did not mind much. However, when Dao Lao Er took charge of Bai Yu Jing, rules became more stringent.

Dao Lao Er cast a glance at the young Taoist boy’s Daoist crown and let out a cold laugh. 

The fish-tail crown was likely bestowed by the ancestor of the Jiang clan from the Purple Qi Pavilion, intended to make the little fellow appear obedient to his lineage. Upon returning to Bai Yu Jing, Jiang Yun Sheng had switched to the crown style from Qing Cui City, a Ruyi crown. 

If it weren’t for his senior brother’s face, Dao Lao Er might have insisted that the young Taoist boy wear the lotus crown of his disciple, Lu Chen, for then Dao Lao Er would not have been so accommodating.

Everyone in Bai Yu Jing and the entire Qing Ming realm understood one thing: Dao Lao Er's silence while watching was, in itself, the greatest concession.

“Yun Sheng, when did you become the lord of Qing Cui City? Your uncle has prepared a congratulatory gift! As my nephew, you can’t leave your uncle waiting too long; it’ll only make his eyes feel dry,” Lu Chen leaned against the railing, turning to smile.

“I have a good relationship with your Dao Grandmaster and the Grand Master. Even if they don’t come for the ceremony, it’s still reasonable for your uncle to officiate it. Besides, your uncle is known for having the fewest rules. What could take several days could easily be done in a single incense stick’s time.”

The young Taoist boy remained silent, merely bowing again respectfully, as if to express gratitude to his uncle Lu Chen, while also apologizing to the second Grand Master beside him.

Back then, in his youthful ignorance, he had secretly shifted allegiance to the Grand Master of Bai Yu Jing, which was a huge taboo for his family. The key was that at the time, the Grand Master was suppressing the outer demons and was unaware. This was purely because the young uncle had dragged him to Qing Cui City to pay respects and make offerings, leading his family to quickly “relocate” him to the Haoran World, specifically to the Upside-Down Mountain, demanding that he always wear the fish-tail crown, or they would expel him from the ancestral hall, or leave him in the Haoran World instead.

The young Taoist boy, named Jiang Yun Sheng, had been neighbors and guardians with the sword-wielding Zhang Lu on Upside-Down Mountain for many years. This Jiang Yun Sheng, who was expected to become the lord of Qing Cui City, often leaned against a cow-tethering post, enjoying sitting on a cushion while reading novels about talented scholars and heroines or tales of wandering heroes. Among the high-level Taoists of Upside-Down Mountain, he was the most approachable, and many children liked to go there to frolic and play, asking the young Taoist to help them soar through the clouds.

Jiang Yun Sheng’s family ancestor was the head of the Purple Qi Pavilion, one of the twelve towers of Bai Yu Jing, who had ascended.

The Purple Qi Pavilion boasted lofty mist and swirling purple energy, as well as a dense sword aura piercing through the heavens, praised as “The sun and moon float above, the purple energy piled high, a home within the palm of an immortal.” As this pavilion was located at the easternmost part of Bai Yu Jing, among the high-level immortals, it was already situated high in the clouds, receiving the light of the sun and moon first. Most of the female immortal disciples cultivating in this pavilion originally bore the surname Jiang or were given the surname Jiang, often adorned with hibiscus crowns and water jade hairpins, earning them the reputation of “Spring Officials.”

The Jiang clan of Bai Yu Jing and the Jiang clan of Tong Ye Prefecture shared a similar plight in their circumstances.

Qing Cui City bordered Shen Xiao City, with both city lords hailing from the Grand Master lineage of Bai Yu Jing, the latter being the Daoist sage stationed at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Meanwhile, the great deity residing at the peak of Upside-Down Mountain was Dao Lao Er’s direct disciple, responsible for guarding the world’s largest mountain seal, which was upside-down in the Haoran World.

Jiang Yun Sheng was born in the Purple Qi Pavilion, which was undoubtedly part of Dao Lao Er's lineage. However, in his youth, due to Lu Chen's persuasion, he, as a direct descendant of the Purple Qi Pavilion, shifted allegiance to the Grand Master’s lineage. According to family records, Jiang Yun Sheng was several generations removed from his ancestral figure, but within the Daoist hierarchy of the Qing Ming realm, he was considered of the same generation as his ancestor in Bai Yu Jing. Therefore, as long as he was not at the Purple Qi Pavilion, if he were to encounter his ancestor, they would greet each other with bows, addressing each other as brothers, but upon returning to the Purple Qi Pavilion, it would be calculated differently.

The Northern Ju Lu Prefecture’s great deity Xie Shi, the leader of the Baoping Prefecture’s Divine Talismans Sect, and Tian Jun Qi Zhen, originally also had the Grand Deity of Taiping Mountain from Tong Ye Prefecture and the Mountain Lord Song Mao.

These figures belonged to the branches of Lu Chen, Dao Lao Er, and the Grand Master respectively. Among them, the Daoist lineage of the Divine Talismans Sect was relatively complex. Although all Taoists and female disciples wore fish-tail crowns, they still shared connections with the other two lineages, with some being distant relatives of the five cities and twelve towers of Bai Yu Jing across a realm.

Of course, there was also He Xiao Liang, who founded a sect in Northern Ju Lu Prefecture, and the hidden Daoist of the White Frost Dynasty, who had taken the name Cao Rong, all belonging to Lu Chen's direct lineage.

These Taoist sects originating from Bai Yu Jing stood in opposition to the local Dragon Tiger Mountain Tianshi Mansion in the Haoran World, with their talismans and spells serving as a stabilizing force among the various sects.

In the Haoran World, with its myriad teachings and philosophies, the Dao was diverse, and human hearts were naturally not merely divided by good and evil.

Dao Lao Er asked, “Why did you specifically choose Chen Ping An back then in Li Zhu Cave Heaven as your closed-door disciple?”

It was said that one of his direct disciples, He Xiao Liang from the Qing Liang Sect, had some messy entanglements with Chen Ping An.

In truth, looking at this lazy junior brother, who had finally taken things seriously once, as long as Chen Ping An was willing to negotiate, Lu Chen could easily elevate him another generation; it was all negotiable.

Lu Chen smiled, “Chen Ping An had already revealed the mysteries near Jiao Long Gully. I was looking at the potential for him to become my disciple, to abandon his original path. It wasn’t about Chen Ping An himself; it’s more about what I, Lu Chen, find worthy. Otherwise, what can one Chen Ping An do? It seems like I’m giving him many choices, yet in fact, he has none. Isn’t that the way of life? It’s not just Chen Ping An stuck in such a predicament.”

Lu Chen continued, “The same logic applies to that unreasonable ancient being, who chose Chen Ping An not out of his own will. A naive boy, what could he understand back then? In reality, it was Qi Jing Chun who wanted to shape things in a certain way. But once one gives rise to two, and two gives rise to three, three gives rise to myriad things, it gradually becomes quite the spectacle. Ultimately, what began as Qi Jing Chun’s hope turned into Chen Ping An’s entire life. I just wonder what Qi Jing Chun asked Dao Ancestor when he traveled to the Lotus Small Cave Heaven. I once asked Dao Ancestor, but he didn’t elaborate.”

Thinking back to that time when the young boy, who first stepped onto the bluestone roads of Fu Lu Street and Tao Ye Alley, was just a mud-bottle kid in straw sandals, standing outside a school, instinctively wiping his palms before pulling out an envelope. At that moment, he surely couldn’t have imagined that his future would be what it is today. He would step through so many mountains and rivers, witnessing countless grand waves and the separations of life and death.

Dao Lao Er asked, “It seems that Cui Zhan has changed his trump card for dealing with the wild lands. Otherwise, with the chaos of the world, he could easily avoid many restrictions.”

Lu Chen chuckled, “He wouldn’t dare. Once he brings it out, it would be far more blasphemous than betraying his master and extinguishing his ancestors. Moreover, it’s all very sudden; time is of the essence. In this world, how many things can be negotiated properly?”

Lu Chen sighed, “Cui Zhan had an edge over the founder of the technique masters back in the day, making the latter think himself worthy of a 'ten.' The vast majority of cultivators on the mountain peaks across several realms don’t even understand the knowledge behind it. It’s a great study. If that fearful end-time truly arrives one day, there’s no stopping it, so even if the world loses technique masters and all cultivators, everyone would still remain at the foot of the mountain.”

“At that point, the only teachings left by the technique masters would still allow many to attain the Dao, which might just be what worries Cui Zhan the most. For example, the human race disappearing entirely and becoming the old members of the new divine court could very well happen. Cui Zhan seems to have always believed that day would come, which is why even though Baoping Prefecture is in a perilous position, he still dares not truly ally with the Mo Clan.”

“So, that disappointed giant of the Mo Clan, feeling embarrassed, turned to help Chen Chuan An in Nan Po Sha Prefecture. However, the Mo Clan is still the Mo Clan; their wanderers retain an ancient spirit, not hesitating to stake their entire fortune in Baoping Prefecture. Moreover, the Mo Clan’s deal has indeed proven profitable—they are merchants, after all, with greater ambitions than farmers or pharmacists.”

Dao Lao Er recalled something, “What do you plan to do about that Lu clan disciple?”

The Ouhua Blessed Land in the Haoran World’s Tong Ye Prefecture was divided into four parts by the old temple master using a blend of sketch and vibrant colors, three of which followed the old temple master and ascended to the Qing Ming realm.

Among them, Lu Tai occupied one of the blessed lands, successfully “ascending” away from the blessed land, beginning to reveal himself in the Qing Ming realm, and had developed an extremely good relationship with a young female disciple who had stepped into the human realm—more like dao companions than just companions.

Lu Chen shrugged, “What? You want to take him as your closed-door disciple? Aren’t you afraid of granting that Zou fellow his wish?”

As for this disciple who had again arbitrarily renamed himself “Lu Tai,” with his rare Yin-Yang Fish physique, he was undoubtedly a divine seed, but Lu Chen was not keen on meeting him. Later generations often misunderstood the concept of divine seeds, not realizing that true divine seeds are the ones that understand the essence of the divine before becoming immortal. It’s not merely about having good cultivation talent; at most, they are just seedlings of the Dao.

Jiang Yun Sheng stood by, dumbfounded. Back in Upside-Down Mountain, this young Taoist boy had once sent Lu Tai flying out of the incense offering room with a single slap.
Lu Tai had deep ties with that obnoxious bull-nosed figure. If he were to become the direct disciple of the Second Palm Teacher in the future and take up residence in one of the Twelve Towers of the Five Cities, with Lu Tai’s petty nature inherited from his ancestors, wouldn’t he be destined to clash with himself for hundreds or even thousands of years? The White Jade Capital was already in a state where their master had not shown his face for a long time, and the two uncles took turns managing their affairs for a century. This had only added more chaos to the already turbulent realm of Qingming. If it weren’t for the opening of the Fifth Realm, Jiang Yunsheng might have felt that his relatively peaceful hometown had turned into the tumultuous world of the Upside-Down Mountain.

Now, that Upside-Down Mountain had transformed back into a seal that could be worn around one’s waist or even refined into a life-bound object. It was said that the Second Palm Teacher had entrusted it to the young uncle, Shan Qing.

Jiang Yunsheng was quite curious about the young uncle he had never met, but given the circumstances of the past ninety years, it seemed they were destined to remain apart.

“Never mind these things,” Dao Lao Er said. “Let the heavens and the earth calculate; I shall walk my own path.”

Lu Chen shook his head. “Zouzi’s thoughts are rather… peculiar. He views the current state of the world as an age of decline and has begun to lay down his plans early on, whereas practitioners can only wait for this decline to come. Zouzi has even disregarded the Three Teachings’ founders. This isn’t a case of blindness due to a single leaf, but rather a deliberate choice to overlook. Thus, it is indeed normal for one person to overshadow the entire Lu clan in the realm of Haoran.”

In the Lihuzhu Cave Heaven, Lu Chen and that Zouzi had never actually met. One of them was setting up a stall, while the other was also managing his own affairs, each living their own lives. Though they seemed to have no interaction, it was akin to the naming of the two “life-bound flying swords” of Zouzi’s disciples and Lu Chen’s descendants—both sharp and pointed against each other.

The casual conversation between the two senior brothers left the young Taoist boy from Qingcui City feeling rather pitiful. With both masters speaking of an age of decline, Jiang Yunsheng felt his heart racing, his Dao heart wobbly.

Suddenly, Lu Chen smiled broadly and said, “Yunsheng, your ancestor was quite impressive back in the day, opening the seas of clouds and striking the Lihuzhu Cave Heaven. Unfortunately, you were far away at the Upside-Down Mountain and lacking in cultivation, so you couldn’t witness this scene in person. No worries, I have a treasured scroll depicting the River of Time, which I’ve kept for many years. I’ll gift it to you. Take it back to the Ziqi Tower and frame it properly. Your ancestor will surely be pleased, and supporting you as the lord of Qingcui City will become a straightforward affair.”

The young Taoist boy watched with eyes wide open, remaining indifferent to the conversation.

Dao Lao Er frowned and said, “Enough, don’t go twisting things around for the kid. I have no intentions regarding Jiang Yunsheng or Qingcui City. Whoever wishes to contend for the position of city lord should do so based on their own abilities. If Jiang Yunsheng can take it, so be it. Qingcui City has always been regarded as the territory of the senior brother; I have no objections to who takes charge. My only concern is if they manage it poorly, leaving a mess for the senior brother to clean up.”

Lu Chen shook his head. “Oh, senior brother, you and I are up here, and even the slightest flick of our sleeves or furrow of our brows causes the immortals below to ponder over it for quite a long time. Compete? How can Jiang Yunsheng compete? After finally gathering the courage to reminisce with the two uncles today, the Second Palm Teacher didn’t spare him a single glance. How do you think the Twelve Towers of the Five Cities will regard Jiang Yunsheng? Ultimately, what seems trivial to you is a matter of life and death for Jiang Yunsheng. Of course, you can choose not to care, thinking it’s simply the natural order of things…”

Dao Lao Er could hardly tolerate Lu Chen’s demeanor. It was neither as natural as their master nor as straightforward as their senior brother, which made him somewhat impatient. He asked bluntly, “Do you want Shan Qing to take over Qingcui City or Jiang Yunsheng?”

Jiang Yunsheng sighed. Great, the Third Palm Teacher was rambling over there, dragging him into this mess. He genuinely couldn’t tell if the Third Palm Teacher was trying to help him or set him up for failure. If the Second Palm Teacher weren’t present, he would have already started to vent his frustrations.

In truth, Jiang Yunsheng didn’t particularly care about the ownership of Qingcui City. He had steeled himself to come here today precisely because he had rarely spotted Lu Uncle’s figure. It would be even better if the latest young uncle took over Qingcui City, saving him from being pushed into the spotlight. Once he assumed the position of city lord, he would be inundated with work and conflicts. Having stayed at the Upside-Down Mountain for so long, he had grown accustomed to a leisurely life, practicing when there was something to do and reading when there wasn’t. Furthermore, given his current realm and reputation, he was hardly qualified to stand out and govern a city renowned as the Little White Jade Capital.

Lu Chen smiled and patted the young Taoist boy on the head. “You may leave now.”

The young Taoist boy quickly bowed and took his leave, riding the wind back to Qingcui City.

Dao Lao Er spoke in a soft voice, “You just placed a celestial demon from the outer realms right in Jiang Yunsheng’s heart?”

Lu Chen chuckled. “I’m just bored.”

Dao Lao Er reminded him, “You should return to the Outer Heaven.”

Lu Chen merely pretended not to understand, remaining silent for a long time before suddenly saying, “Senior brother, have you ever thought about the day someone comes to challenge you to a duel?”

Dao Lao Er replied, “That’s not something that happens often.”

Even if he was hailed as truly invincible, there were still those in this realm of Qingming willing to challenge the Second Palm Teacher of the White Jade Capital.

Lu Chen smiled. “I’m talking about a duel that would require you to exert all your strength.”

“Are you referring to A Liang? Bai Ye? Or perhaps Chen Ping’an, who has ascended to this realm?” Dao Lao Er asked. “How long would we have to wait for that, and even then, whether we would get the chance is another matter.”

Lu Chen raised both hands, tapping his fingers lightly on the lotus crown, looking innocent. “You’re the one who brought it up; I didn’t say anything.”

Dao Lao Er chuckled, “You really are exceedingly bored.”

Lu Chen leaned on the railing. “I’m looking forward to Chen Ping’an wandering around in this realm. Who knows, he might end up more adept at setting up fortune-telling stalls than I am.”

Dao Lao Er said, “He would need a physique comparable to a Ten Realms martial artist, along with the support of an ascended cultivator’s spiritual energy, to truly wield a sword and serve as a sword attendant.”

Lu Chen replied, “It doesn’t have to be that complicated; reaching the Fourteen Realms would suffice. Not as a sword attendant, but as the master of sword attendants. Of course, he needs to stay alive for that to happen.”

Dao Lao Er laughed heartily. “I have some anticipation. After cultivating for eight thousand years, missing the ancient battlefields, it’s hard to find a worthy opponent.”

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 851: The Five Supreme, Four Immortal Swords, and One White**

At the Tianshi Manor on Longhu Mountain, beneath the Star-Picking Platform.

After the appearance of the sword-bearing young Taoist, another woman deliberately concealed her face and figure with flowing mist and clouds. She bowed deeply at the bottom of the steps, then received the Tianshi’s decree before slowly ascending. As she stepped onto the platform, the illusion dissipated, revealing her true form. Dressed in feathered robes and an elegant crown, she carried herself with a natural grace and charm, a small red mole adorning her brow.

Not only was she a prominent figure in the vast world of Haoran, but she was also one of the highest-ranking celestial foxes, serving as the guardian of the Tianshi Manor for three thousand years. Within Longhu Mountain, she went by the name Lian Zhen.

In her youth, when the Grand Tianshi of Longhu Mountain traveled the world, she secretly followed the young Taoist, who was still in his early twenties, while pretending to be a village girl. The Grand Tianshi intentionally did not expose her true identity, allowing her to follow from a distance and observe his cultivation methods. Over the course of a full sixty years, as the young Tianshi traversed the world, slaying demons and dispelling evil, Lian Zhen benefited from his virtue and protection, escaping several tribulations. Ultimately, she voluntarily joined the Grand Tianshi in Longhu Mountain for her cultivation, and in return, he personally sealed her with a magical imprint, allowing her to withstand the heavenly tribulations.

Upon reaching the platform, she stood high above, as if she could reach out and pluck the stars from the sky.

However, after ascending the Star-Picking Platform, Lian Zhen hesitated and did not approach the youthful Grand Tianshi. Her innate reverence for the sword-bearing Taoist, known as Wu Lei, held her back. The sword cultivator was recognized as the most formidable among the four notorious spirits of the mountain, especially given that the flying sword of the sword immortal could sever heads with a single strike—an ability that was not mere fictional embellishment found in bizarre tales.

That young Taoist was indeed the embodiment of the immortal sword "Wan Fa."

Constrained by the platform's enchantments and unable to counter with her own mystical powers, Lian Zhen resorted to a compromise. She revealed half of her true form, ten massive, snow-white tails trailing behind her, nearly covering the entire pathway of the Star-Picking Platform.

The young Taoist turned to her, offering a warm smile and a nod. 

Lian Zhen quickly returned the gesture, bowing respectfully as she considered herself a handmaid to the Grand Tianshi. Once on the platform, however, she was forced to regard herself as merely a fellow cultivator in the presence of the unsociable sword spirit Wu Lei, to avoid causing any displeasure.

Lian Zhen and Wu Lei rarely exchanged words, and their encounters were infrequent. The Grand Tianshi treated both of them as equals, never regarding them as subordinates.

Lian Zhen understood why the Grand Tianshi wanted to meet with Wu Lei today, to gaze towards the distant Fuyou Isle located in the southwest of the Haoran realm. Yet, Fuyou Isle was now a wild and untamed landscape, and she believed that even with the Grand Tianshi’s divine abilities, he would struggle to perceive it clearly.

The Grand Tianshi continued their previous conversation, "I plan to take this seal and make a trip to Tongye Isle. You stay here to guard the mountain gate."

Wu Lei remained expressionless, his tone cold. "The current state of the world indeed warrants your daring venture, but make sure not to fall into Zhou Mi's hands. Otherwise, it would fall to me to deal with you."

Lian Zhen felt a wave of anxiety, wishing to offer her concerns, yet she dared not speak against her master on such important matters. As her master had once stated, the world was filled with mysteries, and cultivators of higher realms often found their paths increasingly limited, while the winds of fate grew stronger at the summit.

Every moment of helplessness, every involuntary thought, could lead to death and dissolution. All human brilliance would ultimately be swept away by the relentless tides of time, leaving behind only solitude through the ages.

As for the cold demeanor and words of the young Taoist, Lian Zhen found them unsurprising. Though the sword spirit was technically a servant, his pure embodiment of the way transcended the notions of good and evil typically found in later interpretations.

The young Taoist gently lifted an object with a light gesture, revealing a green bamboo flute at his waist. Its inscription echoed the ancient wisdom of the world: "Great blocks of breath, its name is wind."

The current Grand Tianshi of Longhu Mountain, Zhao Tianlai.

One of the ten great figures of the Central Land, he ranked above the likes of Xuanzang in the realm of talismans. Even in the heated debates among the ten greats of Haoran, he undeniably held a place of honor.

The supreme praise of the Five Thunder True Law was embodied in the sword known as Wan Fa, which Zhao Tianlai possessed. He was not only the longest-living Grand Tianshi in Longhu Mountain’s history, but his cultivation level was second only to that of the long-absent founding ancestor who had traveled far beyond the realm. Furthermore, Zhao Tianlai was regarded as one of the few with the greatest potential to ascend to the Fourteenth Realm.

However, the unpredictability of worldly affairs meant that a cultivator wielding an immortal sword often drew the sword far less frequently than an ordinary sword cultivator residing on the mountain.

It was noted by keen observers that the three immortal swords had been drawn a limited number of times in the mortal realm. Bai Ye, after borrowing the immortal sword "Taibai" from Daoist Sun of the Grand Xuandu, had drawn his sword no more than ten times. 

The invincible Bai Yujing of Qingming Heaven had only used his sword a handful of times throughout his long cultivation journey. Even when facing the legendary strongmen atop the mountain, he had no need to draw his "Dao Zang." The most recent instance was when he confronted the second Daoist on the peak with the Grand Xuandu, who was considered the ancestral home of the Sword Immortal lineage. In his encounters with the ascendant Ah Liang, both fought barehanded, one without his sword, the other willingly leaving his immortal sword aside.

As for the Grand Tianshi of Longhu Mountain, his sword was drawn more times in comparison to the previous two. Generally, after descending for travels, he drew his sword three to five times in each realm.

Regarding the fourth immortal sword, among the few who knew the truth were the mountain's elite cultivators. Zhao Tianlai, possessing a sword spirit and skilled in divination, happened to be one of them. He not only knew that the fourth sword was called "Tianzhen," but he was also aware that it was neither housed in the Sword Tower of Nanposha nor wielded by the dragon-slaying hero from three millennia ago; instead, it had been left at the Sword Qi Great Wall for ten thousand years.

As for the legendary dragon-slaying hero, whose identity was a closely guarded secret, it was known only that he hailed from a superior blessed land that remains sealed to this day and had a profound connection to the original ancestor of the military schools. Regardless, during the time of slaying dragons, he managed to teach students like Sun Juzhong from Baidi City, etching his name into history. It could be said that later generations would write extensively about him in wild tales.

Zhao Tianlai turned to Lian Zhen with a smile. "Daoist Lian Zhen, it seems there is someone on Tongye Isle who can be considered a kindred spirit with you."

Lian Zhen nodded gently, "She shares a path but a different lineage, aligned more closely with Qing Ying by Bai Ye's side."

The celestial fox spoke softly, afraid to raise her voice due to the overwhelming sword intent exuded by Wu Lei. 

As one of the four sword spirits, his lethality was comparable to that of an ancient sword cultivator at the Ascended level, yet he lacked any human emotion, creating an innate sense of pressure for beings like Lian Zhen. 

In ancient times, divine beings were exalted above all, and before the emergence of humanity, they had crushed countless creatures of various demon races. Only the true dragons were regarded slightly higher, gathered under one of the five supreme deities of the ancient heavenly court.

The Heavenly Court ruler. 

The sword bearer. Similar in status to the executioners of the Sword Qi Great Wall or the law enforcers of the ancestral hall on the mountain.

The armored one. Comparable to those hidden officials of the Sword Qi Great Wall, who perceived all matters of heaven and earth.

The Fire God, governing the stars of eternity.

The Water God, keeper of the river of time.

In addition, there were twelve high-ranking deities who could manipulate the heavens and drag the stars. Among them, two oversaw the Ascension Platform, responsible for guiding earth immortals to transform into divine spirits, or what later generations would refer to as attaining the ranks of immortals.

As both sword techniques and divine powers descended into the mortal realm, humanity continuously rose, ascending through the platform to become divine beings, their numbers increasing.

Then came a great conflict. This was the very reason why Elder Yang held Ruan Xiu and Li Liu accountable for the greatest sins.

Furthermore, the sword bearers were tasked with breaking through defenses. It was rumored that both had fallen, and according to common logic, this should indeed be the case. This was also why Elder Yang had always regarded her as a sword spirit, extending her existence for millennia. Additionally, she had deliberately presented herself in the guise of a sword attendant.

Ultimately, the founders of the three teachings and the ancient military ancestor joined forces to reach the highest point of heaven, shattering the old heavenly court. 

Wu Lei hesitated for a rare moment.

Zhao Tianlai remarked, "I must admit, reaching the Fourteenth Realm is indeed quite challenging."

The old scholar's path to unity with heaven and earth relied on the merits of sages and harmonizing with the mountains and rivers, resonating with the very essence of the universe. The Sub-Saint achieved this earlier by merging with the Central Land, where one continent and its rivers comprised half of the Haoran realm.

Bai Ye’s path to the Fourteenth Realm was his own poetic journey, astonishingly so, and in some sense, it was far less imitable than the harmony found with heaven and earth. The only later figure regarded as having a talent comparable to Bai Ye was a renowned literary genius praised as the master of a myriad of words, who lamented, “When poetry reaches Bai Ye, it’s a stroke of good fortune; when it arrives at my feet, it’s a tremendous misfortune.”

This individual was so self-deprecating, having to turn poetry into lyrics, that it made others and future generations cautious about attempting to harmonize poetry and the way.

Chun’an, the pure Confucian, shouldered the sun and moon, harboring illumination within his heart, aiming to unite with the true principles of sages.

The former head of the Lotus Flower Temple, who had died on the battlefield, painstakingly refined the Moon Spirit, wishing to enter the Haoran realm and continuously merge with the moon of more blessed lands.

The Fire Dragon True Man, as an outsider with familial ties to the Tianshi Manor of Longhu Mountain, was praised by the cultivators of Haoran as a master of fire, water, and thunder laws, yet he found it challenging to attain harmony.

In the realm of talismans and mysteries, those seeking the elusive unity were akin to the half-true, half-false heart found in a wine gourd, resembling the "Galactic River."

In ancient Daoism, there existed the Tower Observation Sect, which constructed towers from grass for stargazing and divination, hence its name. This lineage held profound mastery over the art of divination, and its connection with the Fire Dragon True Man ran deep. The friendship between the Fire Dragon True Man and the talismanists was not merely based on personalities; they exchanged insights into their arts, with aspirations of walking the path together and ascending to the Fourteenth Realm.

Zhao Tianlai sighed softly, gently waving his sleeve to loosen some restrictions, to prevent someone from later finding excuses to complain.

The young Taoist couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

Lian Zhen, being a latecomer to the conversation, felt helpless.

She quietly asked, “Should I go greet the guests?”

The Grand Tianshi replied irritably, “Greet what guests? He is the master; I am the guest.”

In the three academies of the Central Land, at Suishan, in the Bai Ze Tower, Bai Ye had always turned the tables on the host, often acting more like the master than the actual host, practically wishing to help serve guests with his own resources.

Within the inner sanctum of the Tianshi Manor on Longhu Mountain.

This place was heavily restricted, even more so than the ancestral mountains of the talismanists.

A sneaky old scholar crept in, not heading directly to the Star-Picking Platform. He silently chanted a few times in his heart, believing that if the master did not respond, it meant he had tacitly agreed. He arrived at the private residence of the Grand Tianshi. Although he felt a bit hesitant to enter directly, he paused outside the main hall, looking up at a couplet praising the current Grand Tianshi’s ethereal presence and noble virtues. The old scholar couldn’t help but marvel, wondering who in the world could possess such a remarkable talent for words. The current Grand Tianshi indeed had a discerning eye, willing to replace the previous couplet with an ordinary sentiment for this one.

The content of the couplet was grandiose.

“Virtue respected, and the law transcending the heavens, I stand in this mountain. Feather-robed ministers wielding swords sit with dignity, their celestial winds cooling. I do not know who understands.”

“Subduing demons and exorcising evils, my heart is tied to the mortal realm, banishing all wickedness. Noble figures holding seals command the winds, their divine essence weighing upon the five mountains. If no one cultivates, I shall.”

The horizontal inscription read: "Unity of Heaven and Man."

Should one enter the inner hall, it would lead to the celestial fox's place of cultivation.

The back hall was where the current Grand Tianshi engaged in inquiries about the Dao.

Recalling those days, the old scholar reminisced about drinking with a few disciples by the corner, fanning away the wine aroma with his hand while discussing the celestial fox of the Tianshi Manor. There were speculations if she possessed nine or ten tails, or whether the fox spirit sought to become a Dao partner with the Grand Tianshi but was unable to. In the end, they asked the old scholar for answers. Back then, he was still obscure, lacking the means to travel to the Tianshi Manor. The theories he shared were primarily drawn from wild histories and miscellaneous texts. Even the old scholar himself couldn’t discern their truth, and he hesitated to mislead the disciples, saying only that one should not speak of strange forces, leaving a young disciple disappointed. 

Later, as the old scholar gained renown, he no longer needed to spend money to travel; others willingly funded him to lecture and spread the Dao. He made a special trip to Longhu Mountain, opting not to take the celestial bamboo raft, but instead, strolled up the mountain with a green bamboo staff, exuding confidence. The display at the Tianshi Manor was truly remarkable, and while he could not claim to be the first, he could confidently say that few had dared to tread before him.

He noted that the path of divine spirits was lined with noble figures and cultivators from various palaces and temples, all astonished and delighted. They were surprised that the scholar had never before set foot outside the Confucian academies into the realm of divine beings, making this a rare exception for Longhu Mountain. Rumor had it that the scholar had actively submitted documents to the Tianshi Manor, and even a holy site like Longhu Mountain could not help but feel joy at the arrival of a figure like him.

Naturally, they rejoiced at the presence of the scholar, especially since it coincided with his recent triumph in the three teachings debate, along with two extraordinary feats—one was visiting the sky and earnestly inviting the second Daoist to wield his sword, and the other was requesting the two founders of Buddhism and Daoism to take their seats after the debate concluded.

The old scholar held the fourth divine position in the Confucian Temple, having won two rounds of debate, thus when the scholar unexpectedly arrived at Longhu Mountain, even the Grand Tianshi personally welcomed him at the mountain gate.

Ultimately, the old scholar sat together with the current Grand Tianshi in the main hall, where he sincerely expressed heartfelt words of integrity and conscience, yet his gaze constantly drifted to the inner hall, chuckling softly with each sip of tea.

Finally, the old scholar felt too shy to cross directly through the threshold and chose to wander elsewhere.

He treated Longhu Mountain’s ancestral mountain as his own backyard, reasoning that it wasn’t good hospitality to be overly polite with the master. 

The old scholar couldn’t help but glance back at the couplet and the horizontal inscription, feeling justified for having carried not only the brush but also the glue up the mountain, without needing to trouble the Grand Tianshi to put it up.

What is a guest? This is what it means to be a valued guest!

He headed towards the Moral Hall, where the ancestral hall of Longhu Mountain was located, adorned with portraits of successive ancestors and twelve accompanying deities. Apart from the two disciples of the first Grand Tianshi, the rest were all historical figures from Longhu Mountain’s lineage of outsider Grand Tianshis.

On the main pillars of the ancestral hall rested eight golden dragons of talismans. It was said that as long as a celestial being helped to awaken their eyes and breathed white clouds, a dragon would emerge from the clouds to suppress all demons and evils daring to enter the mountain.

The old scholar sighed, reflecting on the founders of Longhu Mountain, who were indeed heroes. In their time, Li Sheng led a group on a long journey to confront the remnants of divine beings. Although their success was limited, the vastness of the outer realms was unimaginable, and the restrictions were exceedingly exaggerated. However, there were indeed several fierce battles, and the first Grand Tianshi of Longhu Mountain fell on his return journey. His death significantly led to Longhu Mountain, in later generations, losing the notion of “talismans being supreme.” Yet, this should not be blamed on the practitioners of talismans but rather seen as the Dao restoring balance.

The old scholar bowed outside the door, treating it as a distant tribute to the sages.

The main courtyard, known as the Demon Suppression Well, had a jade mirror suspended above its mouth, holding captive the troublesome mountain spirits and water demons suppressed by the Tianshi Manor.

Surrounding the courtyard was a white jade railing, carved with nine mythical beasts, including pure white dragons, representing the essence of thunder and lightning refined by the noble figures of Longhu Mountain through the ages.

A hall that was never opened, its doors plastered with talismans imbued with the seals of past Grand Tianshis, was said to contain countless ferocious and malevolent spirits sealed within.
Throughout history, the Grand Celestial Masters would undergo two significant sealings in their lifetime: one during their acceptance of the seal and the other at the time of its relinquishment.

In the backyard of the Grand Celestial Master's private residence, there stood a towering, ancient osmanthus tree that danced gracefully in the wind. This thousand-year-old tree loomed far above the courtyard walls. The old scholar had been searching the ground for quite a while but couldn't find even a single stone.

This osmanthus tree was a precious treasure acquired by the Grand Celestial Master during his sword-wielding travels across the Treasure Vase Continent. It was a genuine Moon Palace variety. The osmanthus wine brewed from its blossoms was a delicacy, stored away in the mists, reserved for guests—a true specialty of the mountains.

As for that cross-continental journey, Zhao Tianlai had, of course, set out to hunt down the elusive master of the Glazed Pavilion, the one clad in a flowing pink robe. So what if he was a junior brother of Zheng Juzhong from the White Emperor City? Brother Tianlai showed no mercy in his pursuit.

The Grand Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain descending the mountain with his sword was, in itself, a distant deterrent to the White Emperor City. Of course, that brother Huai Xian rarely paid heed to the ties of sect camaraderie.

The old scholar seldom admired others' courage, but this fellow, currently calling himself Liu Chicheng, was quite impressive—similar in nature to the old boatman of Osmanthus Island, who was half a disciple of Lu Chen. 

Having provoked the Grand Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain and endured the wrath of the talismans inscribed on the tortoise-turned-stele, he had finally managed to escape the clutches of the Treasure Vase Continent. However, he continued to attract trouble from Xiao Qi, Xiao Ping'an, and one of the Dao's leaders, Li Xisheng, as well as the Water God, Li Liu...

He truly was a remarkable man, a true talent. The next time they met, he might as well greet Zheng Juzhong as "old brother" before addressing Liu Chicheng as "Liu brother." After all, the relationship between the White Emperor City and the Confucian lineage had always been quite amicable. 

Yet, thinking further, the old scholar couldn't help but feel sorrowful. Having good relations with the great figures of the demonic path... The Imperial Edict Pavilion was a place that preserved the sacred texts and plaques gifted by sages from various sects and the emperors of various countries, as well as the divine proclamations and treasures of invitation to deities.

Within the pavilion were countless treasures of gold and jade, rich in cultural heritage and overflowing with dragon energy. In the old scholar's words, just a glance would compel one to turn away, for it was too captivating to behold, and one could easily become envious after looking too long.

Suddenly, the old scholar felt a bit awkward as a beautiful young female immortal, who was responsible for guarding this sacred place, appeared at the entrance. Despite her youth, her rank in the Celestial Master’s household was exceptionally high. She had been stationed at this minor realm and, being of an immortal realm, she was keenly perceptive. Sensing a change in the old scholar’s aura, she immediately manifested and bowed respectfully, inquiring softly, “Lord Wensheng, may I ask if Master Zuo is well?”

The old scholar stamped his foot and exclaimed, “My disciple is a fool blinded by pig oil! How could he bear to wound the sword-wielding Zhao girl’s direct disciple and bring that sword immortal back to Longhu Mountain to discuss matters with her? Was that so difficult?!”

Regardless of the situation, he first scolded his disciple. The old scholar then collected himself and comforted, “At least that fool is fine, which has caused Zhao girl some worry.”

The female immortal sighed in relief, smiling, “My direct disciple, as a noble of the Huang and Zi ranks, lacks proper restraint in wielding his abilities. If he fell into my hands, his punishment would have been even harsher.”

The old scholar chuckled, “I’ll wander around on my own. I wouldn’t want to disturb Zhao girl’s peaceful cultivation.”

The female immortal nodded gently.

The Grand Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain was her elder brother.

In truth, the Celestial Master’s household was filled with individuals of the Huang and Zi ranks, the vast majority of whom were not true cultivators. Therefore, the matters of seniority were rather unique, with distinctions between ancestral hall genealogies and Daoist rank. The oddity lay in the latter needing to accommodate the former, rather than the other way around. Thus, her and Zhao Tianlai's seniority aligned in both respects, which was exceedingly rare in the Longhu Mountain Celestial Master’s household.

After the old scholar departed, he still felt a pang of sorrow. If only his disciple were a bit more insightful, he could easily ride on the coattails of the illustrious Zhao Tianlai and be regarded as half an elder. Wouldn’t that mean the junior brother would be of equal standing with the Grand Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain? That would make the relationship between the Fallen Peak and Longhu Mountain a familial bond, and surely Longhu Mountain would be overjoyed!

There was a Hundred Flowers Garden, said to be a gift from the Flower Lord and the twelve divine masters, meticulously cultivated over generations to honor the Celestial Master’s household.

There was also a small Thunder Pond, located within a palm-sized inkstone. The base bore the inscription of the Third Thunder Pond. This seemingly unremarkable object was, in fact, second only to the Washing Sword Pond of the Upside-Down Mountain and a legendary Thunder Pond said to be lost in some remote corner of the Northern Julu Continent.

Long neglected on the Grand Celestial Master’s desk, the Celestial Master’s household held an annual writing ceremony. If the Grand Celestial Master were in closed-door training or away on travel, it would be entrusted to the direct disciple of the Huang and Zi ranks to hold the pen, “dip ink,” and write a series of golden talismans. These were used for personal purposes or gifted to sovereigns or mountain deities. A Five-Thunder True Law talisman, whether used by an emperor to bestow upon the mountain shrines or to suppress the fortunes of the land, or gifted by the sect’s ancestor hall to its direct disciples as a protective treasure, would be extraordinarily effective, making it no surprise that it was regarded as a priceless artifact.

Not to mention the numerous mountain formations connected to various dragon veins and peaks, just the two hundred immortal casket swallows on the cliffs, their origins and purposes unclear, were a tremendous deterrent.

Simply taking into account the three unevenly high cloud seas near the Star Picking Platform, each had its significance, with a rain master, thunder general, and lightning lord responsible for overseeing each one.

This was a mountain-top immortal abode with profound foundations painstakingly cultivated over thousands of years.

Historically, Longhu Mountain reached its peak with ten Daoist palaces and eighty-one Daoist temples, alongside the vast expanse of six continents and fifty nations, encompassing the ten great dynasties of the Central Land Divine Continent. They all expended immense financial resources to establish Daoist academies and temples here, promoting the Daoist teachings and sending the best cultivation seeds to train on this mountain.

Thus, at that time, Longhu Mountain not only earned the title of “The Capital of Daoism in the World” but also nominally controlled the talismans and rites of the Three Mountains, presiding over Daoism across the realm.

The talismans and elixirs were inseparable, all housed within Longhu Mountain.

With a lineage stretching back over eight thousand years, the incense and Daoist traditions were long-standing.

In terms of cliff inscriptions and poetic monuments, the number was countless, with Longhu Mountain only second to Suishan.

In terms of heritage, compared to the Fallen Peak of his own closed-door disciples, Longhu Mountain still held a slight edge for the time being.

However, with so many valuable items that weren’t particularly useful, they couldn’t be borrowed or moved away. Ultimately, it came down to the fact that the old scholar had visited too few times, and the accumulated bonds of incense were insufficient.

It was fortunate that his disciple was not around, or else the old scholar surely would have had something to say. When students have nothing to say, it’s perfectly fine, but what kind of senior brother would he be?

A ripple of thought crossed the old scholar’s heart as the Grand Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain asked, “Have you seen enough?”

The old scholar laughed heartily, taking a step onto the Star Picking Platform’s steps. Upon seeing the ten snow-white fox tails unfurling on the ground like a breathtaking scroll, he exclaimed, “Lian Zhen, you’ve grown even more beautiful! Such beauty is beyond compare. The ten scenic spots of Longhu Mountain are hardly sufficient; this scene under the snow, in the Star Picking Pavilion, should be the eleventh scenic spot! No, no, that's too low of a ranking…”

Lian Zhen quickly activated her divine power, retracting the ten fox tails and appearing at the foot of the steps. She bowed in greeting, addressing the old scholar as “Lord Wensheng,” just like the female immortal in charge of the Imperial Edict Pavilion.

The old scholar waved his hand with a smile, “We’re not strangers, Lian Zhen. Why be so formal? You’re making me feel uneasy.”

Zhao Tianlai arrived, standing on the first step beside the old scholar as they ascended slowly together.

A young Taoist boy sat cross-legged at the edge of the Star Picking Platform, gazing out over the sea of clouds, pretending not to notice the old scholar.

The old scholar quietly inquired, “Why did you refuse the proposal of the Fire Dragon True Man back then? Why didn’t you allow that young Taoist to succeed as the external Grand Celestial Master? Longhu Mountain suffers, and the Celestial Master’s household suffers even more. Given the temperament of the Fire Dragon True Man, even if he were to resign from his position, he would undoubtedly protect Longhu Mountain even more fiercely.”

Zhao Tianlai countered, “If I were to perish or fall from grace to the realm of immortals, an external Grand Celestial Master who is still young and lacks sufficient cultivation would have to bear much of the mountain’s grudges. That would not be good for either of them. Instead of being swept along by the currents of fate, it’s better to let the young ones forge their own paths. This way, the Fire Dragon True Man won’t feel guilty towards Longhu Mountain. It’s a good parting, after all.”

In the realm of the Dao, the peaks competed for prominence, each possessing its own unique heights.

Zhao Tianlai held the same view regarding the talismans and the Fire Dragon True Man.

Many of the Huang and Zi ranks in the Celestial Master’s household still couldn’t see beyond the “talismans” title, which was only to be expected. However, if even the Grand Celestial Master Zhao Tianlai were to become fixated on this, the Daoist lineage of Longhu Mountain would truly be in danger. It wasn’t that they didn’t strive for recognition, but rather they sought it in the greater Dao. Otherwise, if another mountain peak arose from the plains, Longhu Mountain would have to cut it down with a sword, or crush it with a seal, or suppress it with a talisman, or let the Fire Dragon True Man move mountains with a sweep of his sleeve… In such a case, the local Daoist lineages would unconditionally acknowledge the Bai Yujing Three Lineages as their ancestors.

The old scholar nodded vigorously, “Yes, yes, yes! Heroes don’t discuss profit and loss; they only recognize right and wrong in their hearts. The Dao is the Dao—one cannot merely speak of it while secretly tripping others.”

When the old scholar spoke like this, it was worth listening to.

Zhao Tianlai then directly asked, “Are you here for Bai Ye?”

The old scholar did not hold back, knowing that there was no point in concealing anything from the Grand Celestial Master. He replied straightforwardly, “You must have noticed the old man’s actions on Suishan. My disciple has been too restrained by Xiao Xian, and Lu Zhi, who left the Southern Posa Continent, ultimately couldn’t match Liu Cha. So, when all is said and done, the battlefield of Fuyang Continent comes down to just Bai Ye and Yu Xuan facing the seven thrones of the barbaric world. Once Liu Cha puts his all into his sword, it will surely change the landscape of an entire continent.”

Lian Zhen, who followed behind the two, hesitated to speak.

The old scholar smiled bitterly, “I’m not expecting the Grand Celestial Master to sacrifice himself without regard for life or death. There’s no such reasoning in this world. Hypocritically advocating righteousness while harboring ulterior motives is not true virtue. I just hope that the Grand Celestial Master does his best; that will be more than enough. For instance, even if you can’t save Bai Ye, at least save Yu Xuan. With this act alone, the future of the righteous world, especially within your own Daoist ranks concerning the ownership of the ‘talismans,’ won’t be so fiercely contested. After all these years, how many messy accounts have accumulated from the affairs of the mountain and the world? Of course, I’m merely offering an example; how the Grand Celestial Master chooses to act is entirely up to you.”

Zhao Tianlai had nothing left to hide, stating, “I plan to make a trip to Tongye Continent; my mind won’t change.”

The old scholar nodded, “That would be excellent. It’s worthy of that horizontal inscription. I believe the Daoist lineage of Longhu Mountain will indeed flourish as the Longhu Mountain Chronicles say, ‘The Dao Capital is our mountain; the longer it persists, the more prosperous it becomes.’”

Zhao Tianlai chuckled, “Old scholar, you truly lead a busy life.”

The old scholar bent down to sit beside the young Taoist boy, saying, “Busy as I may be, I strive not to be so busy that I achieve nothing. Even if I can accomplish just one thing, that is already quite good.”

Zhao Tianlai sat cross-legged beside him.

The young Taoist boy had already stood up, unwilling to mingle with the old scholar.

The old scholar asked, “Would you like to drink?”

Zhao Tianlai replied, “Are you treating me?”

The old scholar fell silent.

Holding a green bamboo flute, Zhao Tianlai said, “You drink a jar of that osmanthus wine and consider it my treat; the rest, please return to their original place.”

The old scholar had been waiting for this moment. He raised his hand, and a jar of wine slid out from his sleeve—not for the sake of the mountain’s spiritual energy, but simply craving the taste of the wine.

The old scholar took a sip, “Actually, when Bai Ye fell to one continent, I already sensed what kind of ending awaited him. Now, all I desire is to turn the worst outcome into something slightly better.”

For example, if Yu Xuan could survive, it would be best if he remained that talisman of Yu Xuan. Or, perhaps Bai Ye could at least avoid complete death. Even if the righteous world would lose one of its finest sword immortals, even if Bai Ye may no longer exist in the righteous world, as long as “Bai Ye” remains, the old scholar wouldn’t have to drink a jar of heartbroken wine. Wherever Bai Ye is, he is still Bai Ye, still that Bai Ye who seems to teach the world.

Zhao Tianlai played the bamboo flute, and indeed, it was like heavenly music.

Golden cranes soared over the mountain peaks, azure phoenixes glided above the sea of clouds. It was like golden and green pearls rolling and adorning a curtain of white pearls.

As the old scholar sipped his wine, he engaged in poetic exchanges and responses.

“Carving out the immortal land of wind and moon, I cultivate the golden mist and ageless body. Yellow-robed residents of the Celestial Realm, peach blossoms bloom, heralding spring across the world. 

The three peaks merge with the rain, soaring like dragons, as the five Thunder Lords receive the homage of Fuyang. A stream of glaze, a myriad of smoke; when the immortal ascends the mountain, he becomes an immortal.”

The young Taoist boy shook his head, saying, “Your flowery verses are no match for the music of the flute.”

He added, “Not even close. Indeed, when it comes to poetry and song, the sages of the Confucian Temple are far outdone by the worldly poets and bards.”

After Lian Zhen had gracefully paid her respects, she seated herself beside the Grand Celestial Master.

By the time Zhao Tianlai put away his bamboo flute, the old scholar had also finished a jar of the Celestial Master’s osmanthus wine.

Reluctant to discard the wine jar into the sea of clouds, he tucked it away into his sleeve, saying, “We should not seek to become deities; we should strive to be the one true deity. A single word makes all the difference. The literary sea is vast, and it must be simplified to the most basic distinction of strength and weakness, so as to isolate and sever the connection between heaven and earth. Therefore, your journey to Tongye Continent may be fraught with danger, perhaps no less than Bai Ye’s stationing in Fuyang Continent. Be cautious of that Jia Sheng, be cautious again.”

Zhao Tianlai smiled and nodded.

With a youthful face and an ancient aura, the mountain breeze brushed against him, enhancing his extraordinary demeanor.

Lian Zhen curiously asked, “Lord Wensheng, may I inquire about the Ascension Platform?”

The old scholar chuckled, “What’s there that cannot be asked? The ancient Heavenly Court resided in a distant galaxy. The so-called immortal riding the wind may never reach it in their lifetime. In earlier times, when deities descended to the earthly realm, apart from a few with great powers who could completely disregard the passage of time, the vast majority still needed to traverse the Ascension Platform to go back and forth. Therefore, the Ascension Platform serves not merely to guide earth immortals to ascend. The Qing Tong Heavenly Lord is responsible for one of them, for there are actually two.”

As for the other, it was the Moon-Trusting Mountain of the barbaric world.

However, it had long since lost its original significance. Back then, Chen Qingdu, along with the Dragon Lord and Guanzhao, questioned the sword at the Moon-Trusting Mountain, not in a spirit of rivalry.

But the remaining intricacies of this matter, the old scholar chose not to elaborate further.

Zhao Tianlai didn’t even share this with Lian Zhen; after all, it was just a jar of osmanthus wine, not worth revisiting old histories. Moreover, that Daoist friend standing alone, as one of the four ancient sword spirits, likely knew more truths than the Grand Celestial Master himself.

The old scholar stood up, laughing, “Though I didn’t get my wish, I truly owe a debt of gratitude to Lian Zhen. Last time, I enjoyed a fine jar of tea, and today I’ve had a good jar of wine here. As a guest, I, this old scholar, am often short on resources, but I’ve always prioritized manners. Last time I gifted a couplet, today I intend to present a seal to a young man from Longhu Mountain who has spent years in secluded inquiry. I would trouble the Grand Celestial Master or Lian Zhen to pass it on to him later.”

Zhao Tianlai stood up, “In the end, we shouldn’t let good resources flow to outsiders.”

That Zhao Yao, who once left the Lihua Cave in a cart, was one of Qi Jingchun’s direct disciples.

Later, during his travels in the Central Land Divine Continent, he had spent some time cultivating in a Daoist palace on Longhu Mountain; his identity was still that of a scholar, even after he went to the Fifth World.

It seemed there was someone he missed dearly in that Ascension City.

Based on some clues, the Daoist’s calculations suggested that Zhao Yao had a close relationship with Bai Ye.

Zhao Tianlai merely held the flute with both hands, smiling silently.

Lian Zhen understood her master’s reluctance to become entangled in worldly affairs, so she stepped in to take the white jade seal from the old scholar. In truth, she wasn’t a stranger to that young man, Zhao Yao.

The old scholar chuckled, “It’s not something to hide; Lian Zhen can freely inspect the seal’s inscription. After all, there’s no rush to hand it over to Zhao Yao. It can be kept safely for nearly ninety years.”

Lian Zhen then stopped being polite, pinching the seal with her fingers and lifting it to take a look.

The four-character inscription...
**The Heart's Lamp Never Sleeps**

Zhao Tianlai glanced over and smiled knowingly, "In the valleys and hills, the spirit is invigorated; in the clouds and waters, the essence is revealed. The heart's lamp never sleeps, and the Dao tree flourishes eternally."

The old scholar laughed heartily, "Brother Tianlai, you’re nearly done reading all the books in the world!"

In truth, Zhao Tianlai had intended to add a compliment about the carving knife’s ability to write beautifully, infused with a touch of celestial and Buddhist essence. However, after the old scholar made his quip, he decided to let it go.

The old scholar, not one to miss an opportunity, ventured, "Could it be that you’re merely buttering me up? I can change that. I could even take back my words."

Lian Zhen, having put away his seal, couldn't help but chuckle. Such a learned man as the old scholar was a rarity in this world.

Zhao Tianlai asked, "Where are you heading off to next?"

The old scholar, still not willing to give up, continued, "Later, I’ll have my disciple forge a seal for you. It could say, 'One careless moment, and you’ve read all the books of the world.' What do you think? Or if you find that too wordy, I could just have it say 'Read All Books' instead."

Zhao Tianlai remained silent.

The old scholar, ever the master of finding a way out, was smooth as flowing water. He began to stroke his beard while smiling. "Two of my disciples are now connected—one found by Xiao Qi, and the other by me. They’ve happened to come together, so naturally, I must go and have a look."

Once the old scholar discreetly exchanged glances, Grandmaster had no choice but to use his powers to shrink the distance, transporting them to a far-off location.

The young Taoist boy asked, "Why must the old scholar go to such lengths?"

Zhao Tianlai chuckled, "When a tree stands out in the forest, the wind will surely bring it down. If a disciple shines too brightly, their teacher will inevitably feel anxious. But this kind of heartache has its own flavor, one that ordinary people can hardly seek."

The young Taoist boy suddenly furrowed his brow.

The old scholar hadn’t even brought back any drinks!

Zhao Tianlai laughed, "So I returned the favor with a careless remark."

The old scholar landed far away, crashing directly into a river.

Once he emerged from the water, for some unknown reason, he sighed heavily before soaring off again.

He found Xiao Baoping and Pei Qian meeting at a royal academy.

Yet, the old scholar didn’t reveal himself immediately. Instead, he gazed from afar at the little girl from years past, now grown into a graceful young woman.

She was their little master uncle and teacher.

With care, she had traversed mountains and waters, saving many along the way. She had never harmed anyone, not even once.

In the lush green mountains and flowing waters, the carefree youth thought nothing of evil.

There were many heartfelt words the old scholar truly cared about, yet he couldn't bear to share them with outsiders.

He feared that people might find out; at times, he also worried they would not know at all.

The old scholar suddenly turned to glance at the southwest direction of the vast world.

**The Fifth Realm**

The Ascension City had just opened up a remote outpost far from its main walls, but it was still just a fledgling city.

Although there were many sword cultivators in Ascension City, even with a significant number of traveling Qi practitioners from the neighboring Fuyun Continent now attached to it, they were still stretched thin, struggling in various ways. Throughout this process, Deng Liang from the Ailai Continent truly contributed significantly, taking on a large part of the responsibility of rallying the Fuyun practitioners, handling matters with far more finesse than the Judicial and Hidden officials.

Not only that, Deng Liang also helped to refine some of the institutions within the Spring Court of Ascension City. The atmosphere there, led by the Marquis of Gaoye, was well-known throughout the city, almost to the point of being money-hungry to an insane degree. Every time a practitioner from the Spring Court arrived, it was as if the heavens were a foot higher and the earth a foot lower; their catchphrases about leaving no blade of grass unturned and stopping at nothing were countless.

As a sword cultivator from the Hidden Officials, Deng Liang also possessed a measure of the true teachings of the former Hidden Official, which made him a respected guest among the Spring Court practitioners, who were busy looting the mountains.

This geographical area had inadvertently carved out a vast territory, placing it almost centrally between Ascension City and the southern world, leading to several disputes with the Tongyezhou practitioners, who were aggressively pushing northward and carving out their own territories.

This carefully chosen outpost was truly a treasure trove of feng shui; aside from a great river flowing through, it also had the potential to create a landscape reminiscent of the Five Mountains. Situated in Tongyezhou, it might very well become the site of a new dynasty.

The other three outposts aiding Ascension City in its efforts to expand were not nearly as domineering and forceful and were relatively closer to the central Ascension City.

After a question-and-answer session with a certain female sword immortal from the Hidden Officials, she left behind a remark: "We are here to bully you Tongyezhou."

Qi Shou and the Marquis of Gaoye, as the leaders of the Judicial and Spring Courts, could do nothing but accept this. Moreover, the Sword Qi Great Wall had a notoriously poor reputation in Tongyezhou.

Ultimately, following the established procedures of the Ancestor Hall, a monument was erected at the highest point of the mountain, inscribed with a single character: "Qi."

Additionally, there were stones inscribed with "Sword" in the east, "Long" in the west, and "City" in the north.

The biggest surprise came from the "Sword" monument, where a young Taoist known as Shan Qing not only split the stone tablet with his sword but also expelled all the sword cultivators from Ascension City.

On the ruins of the "Sword" monument, Ning Yao arrived at the mountain's peak, and without a word, she went to confront Shan Qing. When she reached the realm of Qingming, Ning Yao, without hesitation, asked her question with her sword, ultimately severing the mountain character seal that once hung upside down.

Not only that, but Ning Yao also took the mountain character seal and returned it to the "Sword" monument at the mountain's peak. Before she left, she turned to the pale-faced Shan Qing and warned him, "The next time you wish to duel, let me know. Our swords will divide life and death."

The Taoist who destroyed the "Sword" character, a disciple of the Grandmaster, tacitly accepted this and had no choice but to enter closed-door cultivation to recover.

After this battle, Ning Yao undoubtedly became the leading figure in this new realm, with no one able to contest her status.

On her way back from the "Sword" monument, Ning Yao received a message from Ascension City via flying sword, stating that a serious dispute had arisen with a large group of Tongyezhou practitioners in the southern "Qi" monument territory.

Given the tense atmosphere during the Ancestor Hall meeting, the Hidden Officials had mentioned how to interact with the outside world, which inevitably made many sword cultivators hesitant to act against their opponents.

Thus, Ning Yao had no choice but to venture south again, ready to draw her sword once more.

From that point onward, including the sword cultivators building in the south, the entire Ascension City understood that when dealing with Tongyezhou practitioners, there was no need to be polite. As long as they had the upper hand, they could very well "anger" the Tongyezhou recorders of immortals without consequence.

Deng Liang was much more insightful than Qi Shou and the Marquis of Gaoye. He privately sought them out for drinks, implying that Ning Yao's actions not only relieved their frustrations but were also advantageous. This way, while they formed a grudge against all Tongyezhou practitioners, it would also implicitly strengthen the bonds between Ascension City and the practitioners from Fuyun Continent, increasing their goodwill and making them feel more naturally connected to Ascension City.

As for the recorders of immortals from Tongyezhou, even if they acted with righteous indignation now, once a door was opened regarding their status in Ascension City, they would be more than willing to spend money.

When Ning Yao returned to Ascension City, her mood was somewhat downcast.

That evening, she rarely found herself at an inn. The former gatekeeper of Lihuzhou’s small town had now become the inn's temporary manager, thriving amidst the bustling atmosphere filled with gamblers and drunks.

Ning Yao held a bowl of wine, glancing at the idle announcements plastered on the wall.

Zheng Dafeng greeted Ning Yao with a smile before lowering his voice, continuing to share tales with the patrons about his recent good dreams, where twenty-four celestial maidens graced him with their beauty. He concluded with a lament, "As old men, which of us doesn't have a woman locked away in our hearts? There really are no true bachelors in this world, especially after drinking in my inn."

In truth, the atmosphere in the inn had shifted dramatically upon Ning Yao’s arrival.

Only when Ning Yao stepped in did things return to a semblance of normalcy.

It was unavoidable; as Ning Yao's swordsmanship grew sharper and her reputation soared, Ascension City naturally began to view her as the second great sword immortal.

Above the Judicial, Hidden, and Spring Court officials, Ning Yao stood alone, and it was only natural.

Fortunately, Ning Yao's presence at the inn eased the mood; otherwise, the drinking would have become overly restrained.

A young man, not quite understanding Zheng Dafeng’s innuendo, laughed foolishly and asked him what exactly he meant about locking a woman away, wondering if it was some secret technique from the world of Haoran.

Zheng Dafeng lifted his wine bowl, and immediately someone rushed to fill it. He took a hearty drink and then glanced over at a table where a wealthy female sword cultivator from the old Yuzhu Street sat. She often brought several female sword cultivators to drink, spending lavishly. When Zheng Dafeng subtly glanced her way, a nearby drunkard followed suit, and they both nodded in understanding, realizing why the benches in the inn seemed to be getting narrower; indeed, Zheng Dafeng was a learned man.

As the woman turned her head, Zheng Dafeng quickly averted his gaze, wiping his mouth lightly, and turned back to the young man, saying, "Brother, your thoughts are rather crude. It’s not some technique or magic; when a man holds a woman in his heart, it’s just a pair of self-promised immortal lovers. Whether she’s a mountain fairy or a common girl, she will always look as youthful as a girl in her teens or twenties. Beautiful, isn’t it? Of course, it is."

Everyone suddenly seemed enlightened. Indeed, there was some truth to that.

Zheng Dafeng scratched his head with one hand while pouring wine for others with the other, saying, "Alright, brothers, let’s all rise and toast."

While drinking, Zheng Dafeng continued to smile, but occasionally, as he lowered his head to drink, his eyes held a subtle, unspoken sorrow, seeing through the wine to the people beyond.

After having some wine, Ning Yao took the initiative to seek out the second-in-command of the Judicial officials, Nian Xin.

Any sword cultivator from the Hidden Officials would likely have reservations about meeting this person, but Ning Yao was an exception.

Nian Xin’s abode was located in a quiet alley, quite simple.

In the night, after Ning Yao entered and took a seat, she got straight to the point, "Senior Nian Xin, did he leave a letter here?"

Nian Xin, draped in a loose robe, nodded, "Indeed, he left a letter. However, according to my agreement with Chen Ping'an, I cannot give it to you just yet. In fact, it would be best for you, Miss Ning, to never open this letter in your lifetime."

As Nian Xin spoke, her fingers gently twirled a wick on the table.

Ning Yao nodded, glancing at the peculiar lamp before choosing not to ask for the letter.

To her surprise, Nian Xin pulled the letter from her sleeve, smiling, "But I think it’s better to open it early; perhaps it will bring some good fortune."

Ning Yao hesitated.

Nian Xin placed the letter on the table, murmuring to herself, "I have kept my promise and preserved this letter well."

In truth, Chen Ping'an had given three letters in total. Apart from the one to Nian Xin, another was given to Bai Shou, the direct disciple of the Taihui Sword Sect at the Pianran Peak.

At that time, he privately told the young man that when his master was particularly sad and would drink alone, he should give this letter to his master.

This letter merely requested Liu Jinglong’s assistance in reasoning with the Bride Ghost regarding a certain matter. Chen Ping'an believed Liu Jinglong would handle it better than he could.

The final letter was given to Wei Wendong at Chunfan Studio, which actually contained two letters. One was for Zhu Lian, and the other for Liu Xianyang.

This letter from the Falling Star Mountain detailed many matters, including appointing Cao Qinglang as the next mountain lord and ensuring he looked after Pei Qian.

The letter in Ning Yao's hands, entrusted to Nian Xin, was the earliest written by the young Hidden Official, yet it had taken the longest to complete.

As Ning Yao opened the envelope and read the first line, she immediately turned away.

Nian Xin let out a soft sigh. That young Hidden Official must have written something quite absurd for Ning Yao, a woman of such stature, to react this way.

Nian Xin quietly stood up, taking the lamp with her as she left the room to give Ning Yao some solitude.

Ning Yao continued to turn away, reading the first line of the letter once more.

"Ning Yao, don’t worry; I’ve always been thinking of you. Even at the last moment of this life, it will still be so."

As she read further into the letter, Ning Yao might skip a few lines, while others she would reread multiple times.

"I'm sorry; even when the situation is as it is, I stubbornly act on my own. Life is like when I was young, collecting herbs by the stream. I managed to cross over back then and was fortunate to meet you. This time, I failed to do so, and it saddened you. If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn’t have gone to the Sword Qi Great Wall to find you. But how could I not? Even if I had a thousand chances, I would seek you out each time."

"There's no way; Chen Ping'an could never remain a lonely orphan from Mud Bottle Lane forever. He could never be a slow-learning kiln apprentice indefinitely, nor could he always be the fallen master of Falling Star Mountain, much less the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The only thing he could do is to be Chen Ping'an, who likes Ning Yao. In truth, growing up, whether it was during these years of traveling or resting, I never felt uncomfortable or suffered too much. Disappointment is inevitable, but hope is always more prevalent."

"Just some heartfelt words you often hear and get flustered about; I can only keep them to myself. You once asked me, ‘What’s so great about liking someone?’ I’ve always wanted to tell you, Chen Ping'an likes Ning Yao, and Ning Yao likes Chen Ping'an; that is undoubtedly the most extraordinary thing in the world. For tens of thousands of years, it is only us who like each other."

Meeting Ning Yao was the happiest thing that had ever happened to Chen Ping'an since he turned four.

"Hello, Ning girl. My father’s surname is Chen, my mother’s surname is Chen, so I am called Chen Ping'an."

"Ning Yao, you must stay safe and sound."

Ning Yao folded the letter, closed her eyes in silence for a long time, then finally stood up and approached the door, pressing her hand against her forehead once more.

Nian Xin emerged from the side room, asking silently, “Is this the reason you can't break through the Immortal realm?”

Ning Yao nodded.

This treasured sword, "Tian Zhen," which had been nurtured for many years, wanted her, Ning Yao, to become its sword servant, while she, who was supposed to be its spirit, would become the master.

Thus, after entering the Immortal realm, Ning Yao had nearly imprisoned it twice within her heart. Over the years, that "Tian Zhen" acted like a mischievous child, constantly evading her, making it hard for Ning Yao to find its traces. As for the previous anomaly, it was the other sword spirit, "Tai Bai," which was similarly a sword spirit, having some mysterious connection with Tian Zhen. The other two swords, "Wan Fa" from Longhu Mountain and "Dao Zang" from Baiyu Jing, likely shared similar circumstances with "Tian Zhen."

Nian Xin said, “Take your time.”

Ning Yao remained silent.

Nian Xin observed Ning Yao, suddenly smiling, “You don’t seem as sad as I imagined.”

Ning Yao replied, “Because I believe in him.”

---

The old scholar still only revealed himself in front of family, chuckling, “Little girls have grown into big girls now.”

Pei Qian instinctively clasped her fists in greeting but felt it was inappropriate when she saw Sister Baoping bow. So she immediately followed suit and bowed to the old scholar.

Pei Qian had recently returned from the Central Divine Continent with Yu Jianfu and had heard about this academy near the Yu family. She had traveled all the way here by herself, carrying a bamboo box and a mountain staff. As for the mute, A Man, who stubbornly refused to leave, he stayed behind with the Yu family to continue being mute. Pei Qian had to remind him not to forget to practice his punches, and the child had remained silent, neither agreeing nor rejecting.

This academy was not part of the seventy-two Confucian academies; if it were, Pei Qian wouldn’t have come.

What Pei Qian didn’t expect was that she would run into Sister Baoping.
The old scholar waved his hand at them, puzzled. “What’s wrong? Have you had another argument?”

Li Baoping nodded in response.

The headmaster of the academy, the one who first articulated what it means to be a true Confucian, had not only penned numerous passionate essays criticizing current affairs but had also earned a reputation for openly criticizing his own esteemed predecessors, which garnered him countless accolades below the mountain. However, it was rumored that some returning practitioners and scholars from Fuyiao Continent and Nanposha Continent attempted to debate with the headmaster but were turned away at the door. This back-and-forth led the headmaster to write another piece lamenting the decline of moral standards in society, which resonated with even more people who shared his concerns.

Li Baoping had previously engaged in a debate with a direct disciple of the headmaster. She first acknowledged the merits of the headmaster's arguments, stating that in the realm of righteousness and within the cultural temples of Central Land, there should certainly be space for everyone to express their honest and unflattering opinions. However, just as she began to discuss the first point of contention—questioning whether the headmaster's heartfelt words, labeled as 'truth,' were indeed the absolute truth—her opponent immediately scoffed and stormed off.

With a sigh, Li Baoping found herself once again in this situation.

At that moment, Pei Qian stood beside Li Baoping, her expression unreadable, and muttered a curse at the departing figure: “To hell with him.”

The disciple of the headmaster, who was both deaf and sharp-tongued, turned around instantly and demanded to know what Pei Qian had said, challenging her to repeat it.

Pei Qian didn't hesitate. “To hell with you!”

Perhaps unwilling to tarnish his scholarly reputation, the young man laughed heartily and turned to Li Baoping, saying, “Look at their attitude! Is this worth my esteemed headmaster's time to even listen to half a word?”

The old scholar, after hearing Li Baoping's concise yet comprehensive account, nodded with a smile, “Well said, Little Baoping. And Pei Qian’s curse was quite delightful too. Both are commendable!”

In the lineage of the Sage of Literature, aside from the closed-door disciples, the direct disciples were often targets of ridicule. However, the old scholar never hesitated to praise the second-generation disciples.

Pei Qian felt a slight blush creep onto her cheeks and scratched her head habitually. She had initially worried that the venerable Mr. Wen Sheng might scold her. It was fine if she faced the brunt of the criticism, but it wouldn’t be good if it reflected poorly on her master.

The old scholar instructed them to wait a moment as he went to find the headmaster, who was known for cursing heaven and earth while worrying about the nation and its people.

It turned out that the headmaster initially didn’t recognize the old scholar. After a brief argument, one of the headmaster’s direct disciples muttered, “Who do you think you are?”

The old scholar retorted immediately, “I am the Fourth Elder!”

The headmaster was momentarily taken aback, recognizing the old scholar, and became even more spirited, questioning whether the once-great sage should silence him simply because of his past status.

The old scholar, uninterested in further discussion, returned to Li Baoping and Pei Qian, leading them towards the Yu family, for that old man Yu was indeed a troublesome character.

Suddenly, the old scholar looked up, exhilarated.

What a sight!

A sword first broke free from the Longhu Mountain Tianshi Mansion, heading straight for Fuyiao Continent. 

Another sword followed, tearing through the celestial barrier between the Qingming Realm and the Haoran Realm.

A third celestial sword shattered the sky of the fifth realm, also heading towards Fuyiao Continent.

In succession, three layers of celestial restrictions in Fuyiao Continent were breached.

Alongside Bai Ye’s own celestial sword, four celestial swords gathered together for the first time in the Haoran Realm.

Bai Ye, the second of the Taibai lineage, wielded the Dao of the Scriptures.

The Grand Master of Longhu Mountain, known for his mastery over myriad laws.

The fourth celestial sword, known as Tian Zhen, symbolizing the Sword Qi Great Wall.

By one’s side, the celestial swords assembled.

 **Chapter 852: Li Hua and the White Tiger Hat**

In the vast wilderness world, Wen Hai Zhou Mi left the northernmost dock of Tongye Continent (Tongye Zhou) and used his supernatural abilities to find both She Yue and Fei Ran. One was casually wandering through the mountains and fields, having suffered two setbacks in foreign lands and his hometown, making the round-faced girl in her cotton clothes increasingly cautious. She began diligently gathering and refining the moonlight from various places. The other was atop Zhaoping Peak, outside the Great Spring Mirage City, admiring the moon. Zhou Mi casually brought one of the ten young people of the world beside him to join in the appreciation of a structure manifested by dharma and a phoenix tree that concealed its truth.

Cui Chan, known as the Embroidered Tiger, was adept at avoiding competition with others in their strongest areas. He preferred to first shore up any weaknesses before maximizing certain strengths, making the struggle for control over Baoping Continent largely ineffective against Zhou Mi’s schemes. It had all come down to a head-on confrontation.

Fei Ran and She Yue both greeted Zhou Mi respectfully. Zhou Mi smiled and nodded, then turned his gaze to Fei Ran, saying with a smile, “You finally decided to make use of your senior brother Qie Yun’s name.”

Fei Ran replied, “I apologize for the trouble I caused Zhou Mi. I’m willing to take the initiative to apologize to the Wuzi Army and exchange for mutual benefits based on military achievements. If I’m lacking, I’ll borrow from my senior brother.”

The temporary preservation of Great Spring City was not due to the impenetrability of Mirage City’s formations or the defensive capabilities of the bordering army after they had consolidated. Rather, it was because Fei Ran, after leaving Taoye Ferry, had a sudden whim at Zhaoping Peak and sent a flying sword message to the old Wuzi army camp, requesting that Great Spring Mirage City be designated as his new territory in Tongye Continent, and that he occupy it alone—not even through the Guiyou camp he belonged to. This created significant conflict with the Wuzi army stationed in the old capital of Nanqi. The title of one of the ten young people wasn’t enough to intimidate the entire army, but in the end, the two sides avoided conflict because Fei Ran convinced them with a single statement.

“Qie Yun is my senior brother.”

Fei Ran didn’t even need to mention trading Mirage City for his senior brother Qie Yun’s military achievements. The five cultivators of the Wuzi army camp fell silent, leaving without a word of harshness.

Jia Shen Camp, a sword cultivator of the great demon Lord Yangzhi’s direct lineage, was respected by the great demon Fei Fei as “Young Master.” Moreover, since Fei Ran and Qie Yun were brothers, these were all top secrets of Jia Zi Camp.

In the wilderness world, reasoning was straightforward. 

However, since Zhou Mi teased about this matter, Fei Ran naturally was willing to adopt a different approach to reasoning. 

In the wilderness world, reasoning was simple because the rules were so clear-cut; the distinction between right and wrong was easily covered. 

Zhou Mi waved his hand, saying a few words that left Fei Ran puzzled, “It’s a small matter. I’ll personally help you settle this later. Don’t worry about just one Mirage City; the entire Great Spring Dynasty is something that should belong to Fei Ran.”

The upper-level demon cultivators of Tongye Continent had almost all sensed the changes in the celestial phenomena across the continent. 

Fortunately, there was no overwhelming anxiety, just a slight relief. 

In the central region of Tongye Continent, a magnificent structure that had long been overdue finally appeared—the Demon Suppression Tower, one of the nine grand towers built by the Confucian Temple. 

This tower overshadowed all things in Tongye Continent. 

The Demon Suppression Tower delineated a circular territory encompassing a thousand miles of mountains and rivers. Zhou Mi stood just outside its boundary with She Yue and Fei Ran. He reached out, pinching his fingers together, lightly pressing against the array that prohibited entry. Ripples were set in motion, causing the scenery across the thousand miles to begin to tremble. As demon cultivators, Fei Ran and She Yue instantly sensed a suffocating pressure from the overwhelming grandeur. Fei Ran dispelled that natural suppression with sword energy, while She Yue gathered moonlight around herself. Only Zhou Mi remained completely unaware of it. Yet it wasn’t because he was not of the demon race; quite the opposite, for reasons unknown, even though Zhou Mi had not yet stepped into the territory governed by the Demon Suppression Tower, the vibrant, multi-colored ripples of light that surged forth seemed to crystallize the essence of heaven and earth. The pressure was evident, as Fei Ran and She Yue both took a few steps back; this was still due to Zhou Mi suppressing the formations of the Demon Suppression Tower. Otherwise, Fei Ran and She Yue would have likely had to retreat quickly from this place.

Zhou Mi withdrew his fingers, and the strange phenomena gradually dissipated.

He looked up at the sky and said to She Yue, “The Lotus Flower Abbot must die; it’s just that it has come a bit too early. Do you know you are the ‘Predecessor of the Bright Moon’? That’s why the side of Tuo Yue Mountain has always regarded you with admiration. The direct disciple of the Grand Ancestor stationed at Tuo Yue Mountain, Xin Zhuang, often visited you in the Bright Moon, but she has always looked down on the Lotus Flower Abbot, who is far superior to her, because Xin Zhuang’s true form used to be the goddess who watered the Moon Palace and cut the osmanthus. Naturally, she wouldn’t think highly of the Lotus Flower Abbot.”

She Yue replied, “I’ve had my suspicions but have never been certain.”

Zhou Mi suddenly laughed, “I advise you to raise your hand to the heavens; how many others look on coldly?”

With a heart full of ancient schemes, burdened by countless frustrations, he cooled down a hot-blooded heart, burning away the sacred texts within.

She Yue pretended not to hear.

Fei Ran then asked, “Can Zhou Mi break this grand tower?”

Zhou Mi replied, “I could, but it wouldn’t be worth the loss, so there’s no need at present. However, compared to the grand tower in Nanpusa Continent, which is merely ornamental, this one is indeed an eyesore and a nuisance.”

Fei Ran genuinely admired Zhou Mi, who hailed from the world of Haoran. Years ago, Fei Ran had studied under Zhou Mi for several years, but they had no formal master-disciple relationship. When they parted, Zhou Mi had jokingly told Fei Ran that one should only read half of the sacred texts. Too little wouldn’t make one a sage, and too much would make one a true sage. Half was just right for gaining both fame and fortune.

Zhou Mi looked up at the sky, seemingly waiting for something.

Suddenly, Fei Ran’s sword heart trembled, instinctively wanting to distance himself from Zhou Mi. 

But in the next moment, he felt a weight lift off his shoulders, only to realize She Yue had vanished without a trace.

Zhou Mi gently shook his sleeves, and from one of them, pure white moonlight shone brightly. He looked towards the bright moon of the Haoran world and smiled, “Just in case.”

The three mountains and waters prohibitions of Fuyun Continent were truly the trump card. Besides surrounding Bai Ye, it was Zhou Mi’s heavenly means that forcibly restrained the rivers of time of that continent, turning it into a lake that was almost still.

Zhou Mi suddenly spoke to Fei Ran through a mental connection, “Your senior brother wants me to relay a message to you. He has done enough in terms of taking in disciples on behalf of the master; it will be up to you from now on.”

Fei Ran’s expression was indifferent as he fixed his gaze on Zhou Mi. 

In an instant, Zhou Mi’s figure vanished from sight.

————

A beam of sword light cleaved through the canopy, traveling from the world of Qingming to that of Haoran.

In the world, immortals ride the wind, and nothing could travel faster than a flying sword—this was common sense. And as one of the four immortal swords, Dao Zang was naturally quicker on this long journey.

At the highest point of Bai Yu Jing, Lu Chen had returned, sitting on the railing with a half-smile, gazing at his disobedient second senior brother. 

Dao Lao Er frowned slightly, displeased, and asked, “What are you doing?”

Lu Chen raised his hands, adjusting the slightly tilted lotus crown that symbolized his position as the headmaster, “Aren’t you afraid of ending up like Taibai Sword? True invincibility is true invincibility; an eight-thousand-year reputation will not be so easily cast aside, will it? No matter how nostalgic Bai Ye is, he has to survive to repay this great favor. I see it as a long shot. Why is my senior brother doing this trade?”

Once he lost that handy immortal sword Dao Zang, his senior brother’s title of true invincibility might just fall into someone else’s hands.

Dao Lao Er countered, “Was there any need for a reason when that foreign heavenly demon infiltrated Jiang Yunsheng’s Dao seed? Is it necessary to give a reason for such violations?”

Lu Chen looked helpless, “Of course there is a reason! I just knew my senior brother would be too lazy to listen, so I didn’t want to bring it up.”

Dao Lao Er said, “Then I certainly have no reason to toss the sword into the Haoran world. After all, it’s exhausting to calculate and scheme. I’ve wanted to say this to you for a long time. But you’ve always been someone who doesn’t heed others’ opinions, so as your senior brother, I used to be just as lazy to say much.”

Lu Chen turned his gaze toward the ethereal Wucheng Twelve Towers, sighing, “My senior brother doesn’t need a reason to act; that’s probably why I differ from you yet still acknowledge our brotherhood.”

The three headmasters of Bai Yu Jing had a rather subtle relationship. The different paths they each took over the course of a century managing Bai Yu Jing illustrated three distinct paths. Particularly with Lu Chen and his senior brother Dao Lao Er, they left the cultivators of the entire Qingming world perplexed and uncertain.

When Dao Lao Er held the reins at Bai Yu Jing for a century, the world had to obediently follow Bai Yu Jing’s rules. Those who most resisted constraints, like the most renowned genius who had gathered countless Dao veins at the Daxuandu Observatory, ended up being personally questioned by Dao Lao Er concerning his sword, leading to a scattering of his Dao throughout the world and an irreconcilable enmity between Bai Yu Jing and Daxuandu Observatory.

When it was Lu Chen’s turn to take charge, the world would once again follow its own path, with gatherings and dispersals being unpredictable, the relationships complex, and chaos reigning. Lu Chen’s connections with places like Daxuandu Observatory or the Sui Chu Palace, which were outside the three lineages of Bai Yu Jing, were actually thriving. Lu Chen often journeyed among them, freely discussing and enjoying wine and scenery, but he never engaged in exchanging Dao techniques. Rumors said that the master of Sui Chu Palace had secluded himself for years, and one of the young candidates among the ten, “Twenty-Two,” actually formed a pair of immortal Dao partners with a female cultivator who was the founding ancestor of a rival sect, which was closely related to this most carefree headmaster of Bai Yu Jing.

When the Great Headmaster of Bai Yu Jing returned, signs of the hidden situation in the world became evident. Various Dao traditions, officials, royal families, and residences of immortals had the opportunity to recuperate and grow stronger.

However, these two disciples, in contrast to the elder disciple who took in disciples on behalf of the Dao ancestor, had a relatively harmonious relationship. Before ascending from his hometown to Bai Yu Jing, Lu Chen had already regarded his future headmaster as an ancient, grand figure alongside the Dao ancestor. Even before Lu Chen set sail, he made a special trip to find an ancient site hidden in the river of time, where the Dao ancestor once crossed with a green ox and a thin cart, and someone insisted on leaving a scripture, thus leaving behind five thousand words for future generations. That person would later become the Dao ancestor’s first disciple, someone whom Lu Chen would praise as “observing heaven and earth, understanding every detail.”

In short, Lu Chen believed his senior brother’s Dao techniques were high, almost to the point of the Dao itself. But in the eyes of the practitioners on the mountaintop of the Qingming world, Lu Chen might not necessarily recognize the self-proclaimed “first in literature, second in martial arts” Dao Lao Er.

Lu Chen closed his eyes, using secret techniques to observe the rivers and mountains through the eyes of a direct disciple, sensing the flow of fate in the Haoran world for a moment. After opening his eyes, he hugged the back of his head with both hands, laughing, “It’s a pity that that proud Grand Master Zhao Tianlai is a step ahead of you in delivering the sword; otherwise, it would have been quite the joke.”

Dao Lao Er sneered, “Let’s see whose immortal sword arrives at Fuyun Continent first.”

The tall Daoist waved his sleeve casually, and a magnificent aura of Qingming Dao, like a silver river hanging in the sky, followed the immortal sword, tearing through the canopy once more.

Lu Chen couldn’t help but turn his head and ask, “Is my senior brother really competing for priority?”

Dao Lao Er countered, “If I really have to bring up the master, will you then obediently go to the Outer Heaven?”

As Lu Chen was about to slowly rise, leisurely riding the wind and preparing to leave, he suddenly chuckled, “I’m truly the matchmaker here; no one can compare.”

It turned out that in the fifth realm, another immortal sword called “Tian Zhen” had emerged, closely following the renowned Wan Fa and Dao Zang, finally making its debut after lying dormant in the Sword Qi Great Wall for millennia. Years ago, when Lu Chen was struggling in Lizhu Cave Heaven, pushing a cart to find this thread of red string took immense effort, only to finally manage to bring the cart to Mud Bottle Alley. However, later on, part of that red string near the Sword Qi Great Wall was severed by Chen Qingdu. It was unclear what Chen Ping’an was thinking, as he seemed to have intentionally kept the red string uncut.

The complexities of human nature, oscillating between divinity and beastliness, engaged in a tug-of-war within the human heart, ultimately enabled humanity to become the one to shatter the ancient heavenly pathways.

Divinity regarded this as the worst, while humanity achieved the best, each walking extremes, thus replacing the one with another.

Dao Lao Er glanced at his smug junior brother, Lu Chen.

Just as Lu Chen was about to continue speaking, a young-looking Taoist appeared beside the railing, “Oh?”

Even Dao Lao Er and Lu Chen were caught off guard, completely unaware.

Lu Chen immediately fell silent, suppressing his expression.

Dao Lao Er bowed respectfully and said solemnly, “Disciple Yu Dou, greets the master.”

Dao Lao Er, whose common name was Yu Dou, hailed from the Qingming world, and had cultivated for eight thousand years. 

Lu Chen quickly bowed backward, landing gracefully, and then bowed, saying, “Disciple Lu Chen, greets the master.”

Lu Chen, the Grand Master of Bai Yu Jing, common name Lu Chen, Dao title Xian Yao, hailed from the Haoran world, cultivated for six thousand years, and had been in charge of Bai Yu Jing for five thousand years.

However, the Dao ancestor’s appearance in that lotus cave was not youthful.

The Dao ancestor smiled, “It’s a pity I could not witness Bai Ye draw his sword.”

It was not that he couldn’t, but rather he did not wish to break the established rules. The Most Sacred First Teacher and the Dao ancestor, along with the founders of the three teachings, collectively established rules for heaven and earth, and for millennia, none had ever violated these rules.

Next to this “youth,” another guest who was visiting Bai Yu Jing for the first time appeared—a visitor from the Haoran world, the East Sea Observer's old master.

For the fourteen-realms old master, Dao Lao Er clearly did not regard him highly, not even glancing at him.

Lu Chen laughed and said, “Old Master, with such celestial skills, you could even arm-wrestle with my master. How did you end up losing to that old scholar? First losing a hairpin and then the essence of the lotus flower’s sun and moon, it truly surprises your junior.”

The old master scoffed, “Lose? Is there a hierarchy in the Dao? Are there dimensions in the Law? Is there a height in the illusory vessel?”

The old Daoist seemed to speak casually, yet his words carried weight, sending ripples throughout Bai Yu Jing’s five cities and twelve towers. Especially in the God Xia City, which temporarily lacked a lord, the tremors were most pronounced.

Lu Chen realized, “I’ve been enlightened.”

Dao Lao Er snorted coldly, and the disturbances in God Xia City promptly ceased.

The Dao ancestor addressed Lu Chen, “Lu Chen.”

Lu Chen immediately understood and smiled, “I will strictly follow the master’s decree.”

However, this third headmaster was not heading to the Outer Heaven but rather to Daxuandu Observatory.

Dao Lao Er was bound for the Outer Heaven, destined to help his junior brother Lu Chen clean up the mess.

The old master said, “The fifth realm is about to undergo a change.”

A brand new realm, where the might of the Dao reigned supreme, would impose its pressure on all. However, Ning Yao had previously been truly “fervent,” her brilliance unmatched, to the extent that even the Dao of that realm had to temporarily retreat from her sharpness. If nothing unexpected happened, Ning Yao would ascend to the realm of immortals, where the pivotal Dao would lie. After all, the first immortal ascendant in the world and the first fourteen realms would accumulate an immense difference in the tribulations of heavenly Dao.

But when that little girl summoned an immortal sword and journeyed through the Haoran world, a single thread could cause a ripple throughout. 

Those ancient existences that were restless would not ignore this; they might no longer remain dormant but instead swarm forth.

The Dao ancestor said, “Otherwise.”

The old master nodded, “A change in heaven doesn’t necessarily mean a change in the world.”

The Dao ancestor chuckled, “Indeed.” 

————

**Ascension City.**

Nian Xin looked at the slightly pale Ning Yao and asked, “Why go through so much trouble?”

Nian Xin truly disagreed with Ning Yao’s choice. It was too reckless, too radical. 

She regretted having shown Ning Yao that confidential letter early on.
The sword strikes from the Tianshi Mansion of Longhu Mountain and the second sword from Bai Yujing were impressive, but in the end, Ning Yao still had the strength to spare. However, she was currently at a bottleneck in her sword cultivation in the Immortal Realm. Summoning her true life sword—a genuine flying sword—was not just a matter of venturing into the unknown; it meant getting entangled in a battle worthy of gods and immortals. It was clear that the risks outweighed the rewards. If her immortal sword "Tian Zhen" was damaged and returned to her in a weakened state, it would be a tremendous loss. If that sword were to shatter and fall on the battlefield of Fuyiao Island, it could very well lead to Ning Yao’s demotion to the Jade Purity Realm, and her ascension to the City of Ascension would mean losing her position as the foremost Sword Immortal in the world. The distance to becoming the first person to ascend to a new realm would only grow further. Ultimately, every slow step would not only obstruct Ning Yao's own path but could also cause the City of Ascension to miss a crucial opportunity to contend for supremacy in the world.

Sitting quietly on the threshold, Ning Yao remained silent, simply wiping away the blood from her brow. 

No matter how she weighed the pros and cons, Ning Yao knew she shouldn't act impulsively. She shook her head and said, "If Chen Ping'an were here, he would definitely stop you."

"For the City of Ascension, I will do what must be done," came the reply.

"But the City of Ascension is one thing, and I am another," Ning Yao insisted. "If the City of Ascension loses an Immortal Realm sword cultivator, it will lose its grasp on the greater world. I don't believe that having Ning Yao alone will truly enable the City of Ascension to contend for power. If the City of Ascension really does fall from grace, then I owe it nothing."

Except for all the hard work he put into planning.

Ning Yao didn't think that his presence would stop her from drawing her sword. Besides, if he were around, she would only have more leisure. There was no need for such worry and effort; all she had to do was wield her sword.

She pressed her hand against her brow. 

This time, calling forth her sword was of utmost importance.

Before this moment, aside from Chen Qingdu, only a few old sword cultivators, including Dong Sangeng and Chen Xi, knew that she possessed a second life sword beyond "Zhan Xian" (Slaying Immortals).

Moreover, even with that life sword "Zhan Xian," Ning Yao was reluctant to summon it, as it could easily be influenced by "Tian Zhen," leading her sword heart to spiral out of control. In such a case, she would inevitably become the sword attendant to the immortal sword "Tian Zhen." The unruly spirit of an immortal sword, combined with its pure sword heart, would require one to either forcibly suppress it with their realm or temper it with a resilient sword heart—there was no other way. Concepts of good and evil, of the Dao being close at hand, were all illusions.

Ning Yao’s nurturing of the two flying swords served as both sword refinement and an inquiry from "Zhan Xian" to "Tian Zhen."

In fact, Ning Yao had once privately asked the senior Sword Immortal a question: Was Chen Ping'an truly alright after that century-old agreement?

At that time, Chen Qingdu had evaded the question, stating that they would have to see how the senior felt at that moment.

Ning Yao's companion, Nianxin, suddenly furrowed her brow and said, "You must be careful; the Dao of this world is aimed at you."

Ning Yao turned to look at the seamstress, feeling as if this warning was intended for Nianxin, who was now reminding herself.

Nianxin shook her head, "I still intend to keep my promise."

Ning Yao nodded, "Without 'Tian Zhen,' I still have 'Zhan Xian.'"

Nianxin suddenly laughed, "Only Ning Yao could make him so fond."

In those years spent in that prison, the young hidden official never spoke of any encounter or reunion with Ning Yao, as if he were a miser hoarding gold, fearing that speaking even a word would cost him dearly.

It was the ascended demon Frostfall, who had calculated with the young hidden official, that learned some of the inside story. Unable to contain her feelings, she shared more with Nianxin.

Frostfall had never truly grasped the labyrinthine depths of Chen Ping'an's mind. She merely shared two rather vague visions of the heart: one was of a youth walking heavily toward a shabby alley house, the world dim and dark, with only the ancestral home illuminated as if a lamp was lit—warmth emanating from within. The boy paused at the door, glancing inside with disbelief and uncontainable joy, making his steps lighter as he crossed the threshold, though he walked more cautiously, as if not wanting to hurry.

The other was of the boy walking alone toward a covered bridge, his steps unsteady, as the world grew darker, until he slowly lifted his head and saw someone sitting on the steps—a figure whose originally dark eyes, akin to the depths of an ancient well, suddenly lit up as if beholding the light of the sun and moon.

Ning Yao took her leave.

Nianxin returned the lamp to the table.

---

In the Tianshi Mansion of Longhu Mountain, after the old scholar left the Star-Picking Platform, Zhao Tianlai said, “Thank you, fellow Daoist, for taking the trip to Fuyiao Island. We can't let the world mock us, saying that our Tianshi Mansion has a sword but it might as well not.”

The young Daoist boy nodded, transforming into a beam of sword light and heading first to Fuyiao Island.

When the old scholar appeared at the Tianshi Mansion, it was during the most perilous moment of the battlefield at Fuyiao Island.

Thus, the old scholar's departure from Suishan was not aimless. Before he rushed to Longhu Mountain in a frenzy, the Sage Ancestor had given him a curious instruction: upon arriving at the Tianshi Mansion, take a casual stroll first; there was no need to rush to reminisce. Hence, the old scholar sought out wine, casually asking Zhao Tianlai for a drink. How could those couplets have been written in vain? Especially the horizontal inscription "Heaven and Man in Harmony," which was not something to be tossed around lightly.

Years ago, there had been quarrels over this in the Confucian Temple, as some felt it would detract from the essence of Confucian Dao, claiming it was against propriety—especially those two who had contributed to reshaping the lineage of the Confucian Dao. In the end, they listened to the old scholar's reasoning but still did not give him a pleasant countenance, so the old scholar's request for just a jar of osmanthus wine couldn't compensate for the bucketful of words exchanged in argument. As for the other dozens of jars of osmanthus wine that might have been forgotten, those could be considered a gift to your Tianshi Mansion. Besides, even if we hypothetically say that gifting someone wine is still gifting, what of it? The esteemed guests of the Tianshi Mansion come and go in droves, but could they compare to the Great God of Suishan? Could they compare to Bai Ze? Or the Sage Ancestor or the Holy Master of Rites? One must have a conscience; taking advantage and pretending to be benevolent is not a good habit—better change that.

After the old scholar was tossed out by Zhao Tianlai from the Star-Picking Platform, the battlefield of Fuyiao Island was split in two.

Within that part of the ancient battlefield that manifested Bai Yexin’s heart, the talismans of the Central Plains engaged in a deadly struggle with the great demon of the Bone Throne, Yu Xuan.

One of the fourteen thrones of the Wild World, facing one of the ten of the Hao Ran, talisman puppets were summoned to battle against the skeletal army, their clamor echoing throughout the battlefield.

This made Bai Yexin's heart and the world around it utterly shattered, but it was Yu Xuan who sustained it with thousands of talismans. Such celestial arts to repair the world were incredibly profound; it was arguably more difficult than simply creating a small world.

Bai Ye remained wielding the Taibai sword, slashing through five thrones, his sword poetry flowing with elegance.

When Yang Zhi finally spoke of Bai Ye's union with the fourteen realms, it was precisely this "Hao Ran Poetry Unmatched" that resided within his heart.

Almost simultaneously, within a small world, Bai Ying, who was alongside the talisman Yu Xuan, had her sword attendant Long Jian wielding a long sword forged from the essence of souls, gently stirring a sword flower, causing a cascade of golden characters to tremble and turn to ash.

Yet, not a hint of spiritual energy was added to the world.

Cutting Rhyme sighed, helpless, and smiled, "Oh my dear, Sister Yang Zhi, you’ve finally seen through it. But is that the current issue? Isn’t it more about guessing how many poems remain in Bai Ye’s heart? How many lines are left?"

The union of the fourteen realms can generally be divided into three categories: timing, geographic advantage, and harmony of people.

The union of the world’s mountains and rivers belongs to the geographic advantage, similar to the sub-saints and literary saints of the Hao Ran realm.

The Master of the Lotus, Yu Xuan, belongs to the union of heavenly timing, relating to the unchanging nature of the sun, moon, and stars that seem untouched by the flowing river of time.

Bai Ye’s union with the fourteen realms belongs to the harmony of people.

Moreover, for sword cultivators to reach the fourteen realms, it's largely the same: timing should not be hoped for, and geographic advantage is meaningless. Moreover, what sword cultivators pursue is the freedom of "the heavens do not bind my sword," so why would they actively seek to align with the heavens to attain the Dao?

Bai Ye’s sword strikes did not cease, ignoring the stagnation of time that bound all things and laws. Instead, his sword light became elusive, and more importantly, his spiritual energy was consumed at an extremely slow rate. No matter how frequently he wielded his sword, aside from the minimal energy consumed in passing the sword, the true cost could only be measured in the poems within his heart.

A waterfall cascades down from heaven, the Yellow River flows to the East Sea, crashing into the flowing river that manifests Yang Zhi's great Dao, producing towering waves—a scene that rivals the grandeur of the contest between Yang Zhi and Fei Fei.

With one strike, Bai Ye severed Yang Zhi’s form of the great serpent that no longer maintained a human head.

That Yuan Shou, wielding a staff of immense length, approached Bai Ye from just over a hundred miles away, becoming one of the closest throne demons to Bai Ye.

With a horizontal strike of the Taibai sword, Bai Ye unleashed a brilliant sword light that forcefully blocked Yuan Shou's descending blow.

Yuan Shou's staff was shattered once more, and he shook his wrist, manifesting another staff inscribed with "Ding Hai," spitting out a mouthful of blood. Fortunately, Bai Ye’s heart poems could not be repeated; otherwise, this fight would never end.

Not only that, but the aftereffects of Bai Ye's sword intent, coupled with the blossoming of his heart, drove the increasingly ferocious Yuan Shou to swing his staff in chaotic fury, wishing to smash the heavens and the earth.

As for the Five Peaks, the first to approach Bai Ye, they found themselves in a similar situation to Bai Ying.

Floating clouds and setting sun, green mud winding, sorrowful birds circling the woods, dead pines hanging down, steep paths winding, craggy cliffs twisting... the great Dao of the azure sky could not be breached.

If Bai Ye could not go forth, how could the great demon of the Five Peaks within the heart of the world?

Such a cosmic phenomenon caused the Five Peaks to appear as towering figures, standing nearly to the heavens, yet neither fist nor weapon could breach the sky.

Bai Ye, the seeker of immortality.

Yang Zhi finally shattered the waters of the Yellow River, but to her surprise, Bai Ye struck again.

With three thousand white hairs, I once fished for the white dragon, drawing my sword to intercept the flowing waters, letting the dragon stream beside me. 

Three thousand snow-white flying swords fell like rain into the stream, severing the true form of the great serpent, Yang Zhi.

In the distance, a general on a white horse crossed the river, banners fluttering, iron cavalry arrayed thick as snow on the mountains, drinking at the water's edge.

With arrows raining and iron spears thrusting, the sword energy fell like rain.

At the border, Bai Ye.

This left Yang Zhi in deep despair.

The great demon, who had just escaped the golden-armored cage, was about to approach Bai Ye when the heavens transformed, dark clouds spreading across the sky, autumn's colors stretching for miles, the vast wilderness filled with a chilling wind.

Where the wind rose, there the sword energy surged, heavy and layered like mountains, each peak blocking the stars, engaging the bull.

Cutting Rhyme remained motionless, tearing open his skin slightly to avoid Bai Ye's strike, watching the sky. Initially, he thought the sword energy was from the white jade coffin falling from the heavens, striking the ground. When he looked down at the world, he speculated it might be the verdant countryside of March, but he found that it was neither; it was right beside a bustling tavern. A youth learning swordsmanship, intoxicated with flower and willow, sharing a drink, embracing the winds of life. 

The young wandering hero, Bai Ye.

This time, Cutting Rhyme could not evade the sword of the youthful wanderer.

In the next moment, as Cutting Rhyme gathered his form, he found himself once more in the starry night sky, laughing bitterly. Even he found it troublesome; the remaining throne demons would likely be even more resolute in their killing intent.

Dreaming of riding a white deer westward into the mountains, where peaks soar four thousand feet high and there are thirty-two of them, thousands of celestial maidens follow, filling the skies with clouds. Singing of the purple haze of the celestial beings, all of you open the heavenly palace for me. True spirits refining jade for a thousand autumns, walking over rainbows, the fallen immortal steps around the azure sky, leaving behind endless forms. 

Taibai is vast, the stars are lined, drunkenly leaning on the eternal pine, who would say the river beneath his feet was wide, yet in his eyes, it was as narrow as a single thread. Suddenly turning back, he extended his hand, smiling at the azure youth...

---

On another battlefield.

Yu Xuan, who rarely fought personally, spent his time teaching Bai Ying some mundane sayings, such as not to compete for anything but a coffin, that frogs want life and snakes want to be full, and that this is what my father calls a bird without feathers being illuminated by the sun; you are a pig stuck in the corner still grunting...

Nonsensical chatter did not distract Yu Xuan from an important task.

First, he secretly concealed two golden talismans within thousands of talismans of varying ranks, hanging at either end of a small world, which were the sun and moon talismans, ultimately transforming into a "ming" character.

The sun and moon illuminated one another, radiating brightly across the world, dispelling darkness. Thus, the mountains celebrated; once Yu Xuan's talisman was unleashed, there was no need for lights in the human realm.

However, the purpose of Yu Xuan casting these two talismans was to confirm one thing: the flow rate of time within the restrictions of Fuyiao Island's world. Was it indeed fast or slow, and if there was a difference, what was the exact discrepancy? Yet even with the sun and moon combining into a single ming character, he still could not ascertain the matter. 

To observe the precise flow of time amidst the layers of restrictions and the small worlds serving as prisons was extraordinarily difficult and arduous.

Yu Xuan then threw out two azure talismans, multitasking as he chanted spells, using one sleeve for two worlds, casting both the day light talisman and the arrow leakage talisman.

"The sundial halts its flow, starlight ceases its motion; fragrant rain falls to the side, sweet dew hangs above. The sun's shadow reveals time, flowing water marks the hour; quickly, like a command!"

"Light in the candle, water in the arrow. Shine brightly in the sky, spirits intertwining; the heavens are completely white, the sun rules the small, melting clouds and breaking the sky! Command!"

With a determined bite of his teeth, Yu Xuan threw out another azure talisman, one of his own creation, the Standing Talisman.

In the mountains, there was no hourglass; an immortal stood in clear spring water, setting twelve lotus leaves, flowing with the waves, marking the twelve hours, with shadows of the sundial undifferentiated.

As the three talismans emerged, the great Dao revealed itself.

Although the three azure talismans burned out instantly, Yu Xuan, even without a lingering glance, had already glimpsed the heavenly secrets, reminding Bai Ye, "Be wary of the reversal of the flow of time..."

Yu Xuan suddenly fell silent.

It turned out that just as Yu Xuan voiced his thoughts, three immortal swords simultaneously broke through the three layers of prohibitions surrounding Fuyiao Island, shredding Yu Xuan's warnings of "be careful," "the flow of time," and "reverse flow."

Moreover, the Cutting Rhyme, who was inside Bai Ye’s heart, just happened to smile at Bai Ye, saying, “In the human realm, Bai Ye truly lives up to his name.”

This "Cutting Rhyme" could not control the three immortal swords, but she could manage the three layers of restrictions and the flow of time.

Thus, even if Yu Xuan had unraveled the heavenly secrets, he could not reveal part of the truth to Bai Ye.

Bai Ye spoke, “Jia Sheng.”

The method of substitution was with Bai Ying, but the method of the substitute was with Cutting Rhyme. So, at present, this Cutting Rhyme could speak of life or death at will.

In another world, or perhaps another "true to its name" realm.

Four immortal swords gathered beside Bai Ye, who held the Taibai sword, Daozang, Tianzhen, and Wanfa, each one wielded with all his might.

The four swords slashed down upon Bai Ying and "Cutting Rhyme," taking the lives of Yuan Shou, the Five Peaks, and Niu Dao without leaving them a chance to survive.

Cutting Rhyme’s form dissipated, having not even touched a sword, yet it was the kind of grand Dao that vanished—smiling subtly, saying, "With a future sword, I slay the present man. Bai Ye can only leave."

In the end, Zhou Mi said, "Next time, let’s have a sword contest, if there’s still an opportunity for both of us."

One sword struck down.

Bai Ye hesitated not, wielding the present sword to sever the throne "Cutting Rhyme."

Zhou Mi actually allowed the sword light to fall upon him.

A whole continent turned upside down, the flow of time chaotic beyond measure.

Yang Zhi and Yuan Shou exchanged glances, seemingly not understanding why they were still alive.

Niu Dao and the Five Peaks wore serious expressions, gazing at Bai Ying, who was inexplicably breaking apart in the realm.
The greatest mystery lay in the whereabouts of Bai Ye. Moreover, why did the aura of Qiyun (切韵) resemble that of Bai Ying (白瑩) so closely? It was as if the path to enlightenment had been thoroughly severed, yet there remained an inexplicable connection, as if Qiyun had inexplicably transformed into Zhou Mi (周密).

As for the talismans and the four celestial swords, their fates only deepened the confusion for the group of resurrected great demons from the Throne of Kings. How had Bai Ye managed to strike down Qiyun and Bai Ying right under Zhou Mi's nose?

Liu Cha (刘叉) sheathed his sword, his expression a tangle of emotions. There was no longer a Bai Ye of the Fourteen Realms in the world. As for the Taibai Sword (太白剑), its scabbard remained, but the sword itself had shattered into four pieces, scattering far and wide, its power like a shooting star.

One shard of the Taibai Sword's tip headed towards the vicinity of the Upside-Down Mountain (倒悬山) ruins. The gray-clad elder seemed as if he had been struck on the head, tumbling into the swirling depths below.

In the Central Plains (中土神洲), Zou Zi (鄒子) suddenly reached out, grabbing a sword-nurturing gourd from Liu Cai (刘材) and trapping one beam of sword light within it. He returned the gourd to Liu Cai, prompting this direct disciple of sword cultivation to bow in gratitude to the scholar.

Feiran (斐然), who believed he was merely passing the time by protecting a mirage city, suddenly widened his eyes, noticing a sword body hovering before him. 

The third beam of sword light followed the Taibai Sword, breaking through the sky of the Fifth Realm and plummeting down, eventually landing softly beside a scholarly figure clad in a blue robe—Zhao Yao (赵繇). 

The final beam of sword light seemed to have been ignored by the gatekeeper, the grand sword immortal Zhang Lu (张祿), as it passed through the gate. What was there to stop a shard of a broken sword? Besides, Zhang Lu felt he had no chance of halting it.

This beam of light headed towards the half-standing Sword Qi Great Wall (剑气长城). 

Chen Ping'an (陈平安) suddenly lifted his head. Though separated by a barrier of cosmic time and space, he still sensed the presence of that sword energy. 

Li Zhen (离真) hesitated, finally choosing silence as he observed the figure in gray robes, who for the first time swept past the northern city wall, intent on preventing that shard of the celestial sword from falling into Chen Ping'an's hands.

Chen Ping'an stumbled, and a Dharma manifestation rose before him—Chen Qingdu (陈清都) wielding a long sword. With a single strike, he aimed at that gray-robed figure. "Dragon Lord, receive the sword."

This would be Chen Qingdu's final sword strike, delivered years after his death, aimed at severing the Dragon Lord.

Li Zhen squatted on the city wall, covering his head with his hands, refusing to look at the scene he had witnessed once before.

In a corner of the Central Plains, Bai Ye appeared under a flowering pear tree, its blossoms radiant like the Taibai. 

Underneath the tree, a child materialized out of thin air, looking around with a hint of confusion before finally gazing up at the pear flowers.

A tiger-headed hat suddenly landed on the child's head, as an old scholar chuckled while adjusting the carefully prepared hat. "If the heavens allow it, let's indulge in some drink. Bai Ye, my young friend, shall we go for a drink?"

On the Sword Qi Great Wall, after much effort, Chen Ping'an propped himself up only to see a bundle of gray-white rag wrapped around a sword tip, hovering before him. What was going on? Had the Dragon Lord and Li Zhen both resorted to tricks? This was quite the plot twist.

An elder appeared beside Chen Ping'an, bending down to pat the young Hidden Official's head and saying, "Consider this compensation for a missed appointment."

Chen Ping'an turned to see only the vanishing figure of the great sword immortal. Before he could rise, Chen Qingdu sat down on the ground, hands folded on his abdomen, gently forming fists. The old man smiled and asked, "How does this sword fare?"

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, dismissing all reservations, and sincerely replied, "Impressive."

Chen Qingdu chuckled, "You really speak without thinking, just like I did back in the day."

Years ago, by the riverside, the young sword cultivator had said, "Go ahead and hit me."

Chen Ping'an reassured him, "Don't worry."

Chen Qingdu nodded. "Very good."

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

And with that, Chen Qingdu departed from the realm of mortals.

Clad in a bright red robe, the young Hidden Official pressed his fists against his knees. Moments later, Chen Ping'an’s robe transformed into a white outfit. He stood up and approached the city wall, gazing across at the half-erected Sword Qi Great Wall.

Just then, a figure landed beside him—Liu Cha, the swordsman with a grand beard. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 853: Life Seems to Linger in the Narrow Alley**

Chen Ping'an had encountered three sword cultivators who regarded themselves as swordsmen: the earliest was A Liang, followed by Pu Rang from Ghostly Valley, and then there was the bearded wanderer beside him, Liu Cha.

The pressure Liu Cha exerted on Chen Ping'an surpassed that of the Dragon Lord, who had been his neighbor for many years. On one hand, Liu Cha's swordsmanship and sword intentions were of a higher caliber; on the other hand, the Dragon Lord had never returned to his peak due to his incomplete physique. Furthermore, the Dragon Lord was ultimately a human sword cultivator, while Liu Cha belonged to the demon race. The path of sewing Chen Ping'an had undertaken, bearing his true name, had an intricate relationship of mutual suppression with Liu Cha.

Liu Cha examined the white-clad Hidden Official with interest. His first disciple, Zhu Ke, had suffered losses at this young man's hands. It was good that Zhu Ke learned not to be ignorant of the world and to realize that beyond the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were still sword cultivators in the vast world.

Chen Ping'an remained unfazed, his robe transforming back into a bright red color as he asked, "What about Ascension City?"

Liu Cha produced a flask of wine, took a swig, and glanced at the young man, who was both stirred and calm. He countered, "Do you still have the ability to care for others?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Indeed, my heart is willing, but my strength is lacking."

The Dragon Lord, clad in gray robes, had just been slain by the Grand Sword Immortal. Chen Qingdu had once said that as long as the Dragon Lord dared to step over the city wall to the north, he would die. This turned out to be true.

Unfortunately, Chen Ping'an had not witnessed the moment the sword struck the Dragon Lord. He pondered the nature of the sword tip that had pierced through—was it from some sword the Dragon Lord had never revealed, or was it an artifact left behind by the Grand Sword Immortal? Following the earlier celestial phenomena, it seemed to originate from the entrance of the Hanging Mountain ruins. But who would cast a sword tip toward the Sword Qi Great Wall? If it were indeed some distant travel relic, why didn’t the Grand Sword Immortal Zhang Lu and the barbaric world obstruct it?

As for the grayish-white "ragged cloth" intertwined with the sword tip, it was irrefutable evidence of the Dragon Lord's death. The remnants of the gray robe resembled a sword cultivator who had either died violently or had perished in battle, then had their life sword forcibly extracted by a great power. Thus, it was certainly not just a robe.

The Grand Sword Immortal merely wanted him to properly collect and refine it, but not into a life-bound object. Instead, to refine it into an external sword—turning a piece of the sword tip into a long sword and the ragged cloth into a scabbard. Eventually, it should become a fine sword for a swordsman.

Chen Ping'an changed the subject, asking, "Is Lu Zhi dead?"

He silently wished, *Don’t die, please don’t die.* The sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall had already lost far too many lives. After finally leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, Lu Zhi and those who were unrepentant towards the sword, their homeland, and the heavens should not merely face a delayed death.

Whether it was Lu Zhi's temperament or her character as a great sword immortal, Chen Ping'an had a deep admiration for her. Involved in the long-term endeavors of the Sword Qi Great Wall across various realms, he hoped Lu Zhi could live for thousands of years. Even if she were to establish her own sect in the vast world, completely severing ties with the Sword Qi Great Wall and Ascension City, it would still be a tremendous good fortune. The style of a founding ancestor often determined the atmosphere of a sect for generations.

If he ever had the chance to reunite with Lu Zhi, the first thing Chen Ping'an would say was, "Lu Zhi, you truly are a beauty beyond compare. Anyone who denies it can take a hike."

Liu Cha replied, "No, Lu Zhi is currently entangled in a battle with Yang Zhi and Yuan Shou. However, your senior brother is nearby on the battlefield, and with Xiao Xian serving as the Hidden Official, he has a good relationship with Lu Zhi. It shouldn't be a problem for her to return to South Posa Continent."

Chen Ping'an immediately asked, "What about Fuyou Continent?"

Liu Cha said, "Bai Ye fell into Mr. Zhou's trap, and the Immortal Sword Taibai has shattered. However, the price for the barbaric world was not small, losing both Bai Ying and Qie Yun."

After this battle, the new faces among the fourteen thrones of the barbaric world would increase significantly.

On the side of the Vast World, Xiao Xian had slain Xun Yuan of Tongye Continent, while Yao Jia killed Zhou Shen Zhi of Central Land. Bai Ying had refined Wanyan Lao Jing of Jin Jia Continent, and a local ascendant from Fuyou Continent was severely injured and almost fell two realms, barely preserving his immortal status. Had it not been for Qi Tingji's timely rescue, he would have been inscribed on the city wall. Now, he had hidden away in a small cave heaven of a lower sect in Liu Xia Continent, entering seclusion to recuperate.

Chen Ping'an seemed lost in thought. 

No wonder that sword tip was a part of the Immortal Sword Taibai.

No wonder the Dragon Lord had tried to block it from approaching him. 

But why had Bai Ye given such a formidable artifact? And especially the most powerful sword tip of an immortal sword?

In the barbaric world, many powerful demons had met their end—He Huazhi, Huang Luan, Yao Jia, Bai Ying, Qie Yun. 

That invincible human poet Bai Ye actually died?! Why was the battlefield in the southwest Fuyou Continent instead of closer to Central Land's Jin Jia Continent? What was the strategy behind the Confucian Temple's plans for war? Yet, it made sense; Bai Ye's relationship with the Confucian Temple was rather ordinary, and the Confucians didn't seem to have the authority to meddle with Bai Ye's swordwork. Furthermore, without knowing the specific circumstances of Fuyou and Jin Jia Continent, Chen Ping'an had no ability to predict outcomes—he could only deduce a few things from the inscriptions on the city wall, "Zhou Shen Zhi" and "Wanyan Lao Jing."

Liu Cha mentioned that just among the throne demons, two had fallen, and with Liu Cha following that sword tip of the Immortal Sword Taibai, did it imply that the battle was an unparalleled massacre, unprecedented in history? Did the Confucian Temple and Central Land have countermeasures? Was Liu Cha truly involved, or was he just a calculated pawn, similar to Cui Zhan's water reversal technique, sent here to prevent any contingencies by eliminating himself?

There were far too many questions and no answers, leaving the truth elusive, as the clues were simply too few. Moreover, Liu Cha's words could only be trusted to a certain extent.

However, Chen Ping'an was acutely aware of one thing: the more the barbaric world and the Jiazhi account sought to eliminate the threats near the city wall, the more it indicated that the situation in the Vast World was improving. It certainly was not in a state of decay; at the very least, South Posa Continent and his homeland of Baoping Continent were still firmly held, or else there would be no need for Liu Cha, the third-highest throne, to personally come and strike.

Liu Cha shattered Chen Ping'an's body and soul at the mountain's peak with a sudden punch.

Liu Cha had not drawn his sword; he merely used his physical strength as a sword cultivator, even holding the wine flask in one hand.

Chen Ping'an could have blocked it but chose not to, bracing himself to withstand the blow. He then gathered his form not far away, puzzled and confused about Liu Cha's intentions. The result of this punch was the same as what the Dragon Lord had once experienced—it couldn't kill him, who was in harmony with the Sword Qi Great Wall. It could even be said that it resembled the punch from the previous Hidden Official, Xiao Xian, as what Chen Ping'an most lacked at this moment was precisely this kind of "martial artist's physical refinement."

However, Chen Ping'an held no false hopes and dared not covet a second punch from Liu Cha.

Liu Cha took another swig of wine and chuckled, "No wonder you were able to endure the Dragon Lord’s numerous sword strikes. Your martial foundation is quite solid."

Numerous strikes? The Dragon Lord had delivered a total of one hundred seventy-nine strikes!

Chen Ping'an asked, "What about Ascension City?"

He couldn't help but ask the same question again.

Liu Cha answered, "Ascension City has established itself in that new world. Not only has it secured a foothold, it currently ranks among the five major forces, expanding its territory the most."

Chen Ping'an released a sigh of relief.

He then exhaled, realizing that Liu Cha was so forthcoming with answers, indicating that his own situation was rather precarious.

As a mere minor earth immortal sword cultivator, did it really require Liu Cha to personally come wielding his sword against the Great Wall?

Sure enough, Liu Cha laughed, "You ask a few questions, and I will offer a few sword strikes. So feel free to ask more; it doesn't matter as long as it's more than three strikes."

Chen Ping'an found himself genuinely asking again, "Is Zhou Mi in cahoots with the Great Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain, making Zhou Mi not only the mastermind behind the scenes but also the highest combatant in the barbaric world?"

Liu Cha smiled, but remained silent.

Chen Ping'an then remarked, "Two were lost to Bai Ying and Qie Yun? Only half, right? My third question: since Mr. Liu didn't answer my second question, that's worse, and he fabricated an answer, so I'll just take it as a sword strike. Otherwise, if I keep asking, Mr. Liu might owe me a few more strikes."

Liu Cha ceased to pay attention to Chen Ping'an, casually traversing the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping'an followed the former third-highest throne swordsman.

Liu Cha crouched down, placing his hand against the city wall, and after a light press, stood up quickly, moving elsewhere. He casually remarked to the white-clad Hidden Official beside him, "Let's just say I owe you two sword strikes; I’ll only strike twenty times. After that, I’ll strike again."

As Liu Cha spoke, he surveyed his surroundings, and the world transformed, thick with sword energy.

Liu Cha took another swig of wine, laughing, "Now that’s rather impolite."

He tossed the wine flask aside, "Alright, I was just trying to scare you earlier, and it was also meant for that old blind man to hear. Zhou Mi wants me to use you as bait to lure that old blind man here to his demise."

Liu Cha had already been convinced by Zhou Mi with the "greater good of the world," coupled with the mandate from the Great Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain to "move by reason." He would never strike a young man again in the Sword Qi Great Wall. But should the opportunity arise to slay a fourteen-realm old blind man, Liu Cha wouldn't mind drawing his sword once more, provided the old blind man left the Ten Thousand Great Mountains, in which case Liu Cha would put forth all his strength.

The wine flask did not fall. Instead, it moved unpredictably, appearing suddenly in various places.

As for the young Hidden Official, he had already vanished from sight.

Liu Cha chuckled, this kid sure is cautious… just like Zhou Mi.

On the opposite city wall, Li Zhen stood up, confusion written across his face.

Zhou Mi suddenly appeared, smiling, "You should thank me for slightly diverting a river of time from its original course."

Li Zhen sighed, "In the end, I was the fool."

Zhou Mi shook his head, "I have always believed that ancient sword cultivators, whether dead or alive, have been grossly underestimated. In that riverside meeting, you should have had your say. But who would want someone standing beside them, appearing to wait for a crossing in the river of time?"

"Back then, I calculated many outcomes for you, trying to figure out how to save yourself and endure until further down the river. However, it was challenging to have a foolproof plan. The unexpected joy inspired me, leading to the current encirclement. However, I originally intended to ambush someone else—a sacrificial offering who had collided with the Vast World alongside many ancient deities. If successful, there would be no more Xiao Fuzi, and Bai Ze might change his mind."

Li Zhen frowned, "Bai Ze has a close relationship with the sacrificial offering and wouldn’t completely turn against the barbaric world?"

Zhou Mi smiled, "In a situation where either side could win, it’s difficult to favor one. However, once the barbaric world holds a six-to-four advantage, whether for the sake of fewer deaths in the Vast World or for the barbaric world to stabilize, Bai Ze’s choice will ultimately boil down to just one. Swift and decisive, only when the world is secured can there be a chance for recovery. Of course, before that, I will definitely find Bai Ze and promise him certain things, making significant concessions."

Zhou Mi turned his gaze southward toward the Ten Thousand Great Mountains, smiling, "The demon Bai Ze speaks for the Vast World, while the human Jia Sheng schemes for the barbaric world. Do you think there are any more fitting natural allies than us?"

Li Zhen replied, "It's a pity it didn't come to pass."

Zhou Mi said, "Indeed, it’s a pity."

Li Zhen lamented, "Jia Sheng's methods are truly insidious."

Zhou Mi laughed, "Both open and covert schemes have their uses. If one can employ covert schemes as effectively as open ones, they would be a master strategist."

Li Zhen muttered, "The Confucian Temple shouldn’t have let you leave the Vast World alive. At the very least, they should have let Jia Sheng die inexplicably at the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Zhou Mi merely shook his head.

Li Zhen asked, "How many great demons do you intend to devour before you are satisfied? I’m genuinely curious if you really are only at the fourteenth realm now? What about you and my master…"

Zhou Mi waved his hand, "What you shouldn't know, don't ask too much, and don't think too deeply."

Liu Cha exerted all his strength in a single strike, slaying Bai Ye, causing the river of time to freeze into a lake. It seemed as if it returned abruptly to its original riverbed, allowing Bai Ye, wielding four immortal swords, to indeed slay four throne demons. Yet afterward, Bai Ye had completely exhausted his spiritual energy and his proudest poems, before Zhou Mi reversed that segment of time once again, leaving only a dead Bai Ye with a broken sword at the crossing of time, while the rest of the world, alongside the six thrones and Liu Cha, who had slain Bai Ye with a sword, returned to the river of time.

However, during this time, when Bai Ye realized that Qie Yun was indeed Jia Sheng, he had already wielded Taibai and struck down Qie Yun. Not only that, but Bai Ye, who had been slain by Liu Cha's sword, also used his Yin spirit to travel far away, returning the blow in kind by reversing time, sacrificing an immortal sword to strike down "Bai Ying" once again. Until that moment, Zhou Mi truly unraveled the lake's restrictions, restoring the normal river of time, rushing forth between heaven and earth.

Thus, afterward, the river of time across the world would be so shattered and chaotic.

All of this was to keep the future Bai Ye as distant as possible from the present Bai Ye. No longer at the fourteenth realm, completely stripped of an immortal sword, Bai Ye would henceforth no longer disrupt the grand scheme of the world. Afterward, whether Bai Ye could return to his peak in a hundred or a thousand years was something Zhou Mi would not only not dread but also eagerly anticipate.

Li Zhen suddenly asked tentatively, "Is Bai Ying… your external manifestation of the Yin spirit? And during the cultivation process, did it mix with many souls, causing 'Bai Ying' to mistakenly believe she is Bai Ying?"

Zhou Mi smiled, "This is why I call myself a fool. I don’t see it that way. I have always valued you as the direct disciple of Tuo Yue Mountain. If it weren't for a slight accident, the young Hidden Official would have replaced Ning Yao in battle, and 'Li Zhen' would now know much more of the inside story. Of course, one of the four immortal swords, 'Tian Zhen,' will either be destroyed or become one of my life-bound objects."

Li Zhen asked, "Zhou Mi, how many great demons have you 'merged' with over the past few millennia?"

The so-called merging of Zhou Mi at the fourteenth realm was simply consuming—He Huazhi, Yao Jia, Qie Yun, and consolidating the Yin spirit "Bai Ying." It was still just consuming.

In fact, there was also the throne demon Huang Luan who had fallen to the Nascent Soul realm!

As for the ascendant from Jin Jia Continent, Wanyan Lao Jing, who thought he could survive, what was his fate? He had fallen into Zhou Mi's hands; what could he do?

In the barbaric world, few had seen Zhou Mi. The people Zhou Mi encountered were mostly promising young individuals. Otherwise, there would be no need for Zhou Mi to intervene; the direct disciples of Tuo Yue Mountain would help to obstruct.

Therefore, Zhou Mi’s status as the second-highest throne in the barbaric world had always given the impression that Tuo Yue Mountain was intentionally doing so, as if they needed someone clever enough to communicate.

Thus, Zhou Mi had always been considered at most a peak ascendant, a high-ranking figure with relatively low combat power.

Meanwhile, the Hollow Bone throne demon, Bai Ying, had almost never engaged in battle with other thrones or ascendants, preferring to scheme in the shadows, digging three feet deep to target those who were secretly nursing their wounds. It was rumored that she turned them into puppets. Hence, Bai Ying seemed to lack combat power but was known for her deep resources and intricate cunning.

Bai Ying, not only possessing the sword attendant Long Jian formed from the Dragon Lord's head, but also the long sword refined from a portion of the residual spirit.

Bai Ying's actions could truly be labeled as without restrictions.

Li Zhen felt quite helpless and powerless, once again crouching down, letting out a long sigh. 

Even with the life-bound immortal sword of the "river of time," Li Zhen did not dare claim the truth of what he saw.

Many times, seeing a fragment of the truth led one to be overly self-assured.

However, for ordinary people, the more self-assured they were, the easier their lives became, both on the mountain and off it. 

Li Zhen was an exception.

Suddenly, Li Zhen recalled something and nearly laughed to the point of tears.
According to legend, in ancient times, the great demon Bai Ying once posed a question to the scholar Zhou Mi: would Mr. Zhou like to become the cultural leader of the wild world? Zhou Mi seemingly only smiled and replied with a single word: "Not enough."

Li Zhen raised his head, staring blankly at the scholar dressed in a blue robe. Was this scholar really that formidable? Zhou Mi simply waited quietly for the old blind man's decision. The old blind man was unchanged, as long as he remained on the mountain, Zhou Mi wouldn’t have to venture into the vast wilderness.

With a chuckle in his heart, Zhou Mi thought, “Li Zhen, think it over well. If you come to understand, come find me in Tongyezhou. If you don’t, it’s no matter; you can remain in the old wilderness realm.”

During the battle on Fuyiao Island, Zhou Mi had made sacrifices to slay Bai Ye, not only employing countless techniques but also paying the fundamental price of relinquishing half of his Dao derived from Bai Ying and the other half from Qie Yun. The former had long been acquired from the wild world, while the latter was the latest from the vast Haoran world.

In a conversation between the young hidden official and Liu Cha, they inadvertently revealed a hidden truth, which was actually just a guess. How to guess? It was simple—by putting oneself in the shoes of a scholar and considering the myriad of scheming thoughts they might harbor. One might as well assume the worst intentions of others, contemplating their plans in the most "thorough and meticulous" manner possible.

There were indeed several clues, such as the death of the Lotus Flower Abbot. If the Grand Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain and Chen Qingdu were mutually restrained by their respective Dao and could not intervene, then as the "hidden official" of the wild world, Zhou Mi should at least have obstructed the situation, instead of standing by while the elder Dong sliced through a great demon and even dragged a round moon into the human realm.

As for how Zhou Mi "persuaded" Qie Yun, Li Zhen couldn’t fathom it. Seemingly aware of Li Zhen's doubts, Zhou Mi took the initiative to clarify, “In my grand scheme, the sword cultivator Feiran is an extremely important entity, far more crucial than figures like She Yue or Yu Si.”

He then uttered something that sent shivers down Li Zhen’s spine, “As for Guanzhao, in my heart, its significance is only slightly less than Feiran’s. Thus, the movements of all lingering souls have always been under my control.”

Zhou Mi continued, “Angry? Is it necessary? A Li Zhen who has been cursing the heavens atop this city for years truly doesn’t wish to break free from the constraints of the riverbed of time? You don’t even want to be a sword cultivator observing anymore?”

He pointed at the distant battlefield where Chen Qingdu had slain the Dragon Lord, “Do you think that last sword from Chen Qingdu wasn’t a signal to Guanzhao? The old histories must eventually be turned over.”

This city had once housed officials of law and hidden officials; in the past, even the former official Jia Sheng had served as a previous law official. Long ago, in the ancient heavenly court, there had been sword bearers and armored ones.

Yet, Bai Ye unexpectedly gifted a sword to Feiran of Tongyezhou, which left Zhou Mi a little displeased, as it required him to divert his attention to handle another unexpected situation.

In the past, while teaching Feiran, although there was no formal teacher-student relationship, Zhou Mi had imparted knowledge to Feiran with more dedication than many direct disciples like Shoucheng or Liubai. In fact, the sect Feiran belonged to had only three remaining members, all of whom had long been Zhou Mi’s pawns due to the arrangements of the Grand Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain. Zhou Mi had even planned that one day, he might appear as Feiran’s “enlightened teacher” in a certain sense, allowing Feiran to gain half a senior brother in Qie Yun, ensuring Feiran would follow him wholeheartedly down a path that seemed almost endless. Behind them would be Li Zhen and figures like Yu Si, following from afar.

Once, in Tuo Yue Mountain, Zhou Mi had met the Grand Ancestor of the Wild, who had been healing for six thousand years, and he had proposed three strategies: the first unexpected event was the ascension of the entire city of the Sword Qi Great Wall to the fifth realm. Otherwise, the losses suffered by the wild world during the battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall would have been much smaller.

The second unexpected event was the annexation of a continent by the embroidered tiger Cui Chan, which stalled the advance of the demon clan from Tongyezhou. Additionally, there were actions taken on both sides regarding Bai Ye’s sword from the fourteenth realm, and the Guandao Guanzhu’s involvement while observing from the other side. Of course, the current young man serving as a hidden official didn’t count as an unexpected event.

Otherwise, Zhou Mi’s primary strategy would have been successfully executed, breaking through the southwestern Fuyiao Island, focusing his main forces on the severely weakened southeastern Tongyezhou, and launching a northern campaign against the vulnerable Baopingzhou, striking decisively to capture the battle-inept Beijuluzhou, and finally, the last wallflower, Aihai Island.

Subsequently, he would confront the Central Plains, the Liuming Island, and the southern Posa Island, during which time he would temporarily return Fuyiao Island to the Central Plains’ Wen Temple. Ultimately, however, the wild world would reclaim both Fuyiao and Jinjiazhou.

But as long as Zhou Mi captured Baopingzhou, it would mark a significant turning point. The most interesting aspect of the three strategies was that the grand trend of the wild world was in direct contrast to Zhou Mi’s achievements in the Dao.

Zhou Mi had no reservations about this, speaking frankly with the old man in gray, who laughed heartily. Not only did he refrain from casually eliminating the rather mediocre Jia Sheng at that time, but he also encouraged Zhou Mi to act freely. After several millennia, Jia Sheng transformed into Zhou Mi, and Zhou Mi in turn produced a Bai Ying. As for the conflicts at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhou Mi had secretly been scheming all along—not only with the slow subversion of the sword cultivators themselves but also focusing more on the sentiments of the people in the Haoran world, such as the Yu Long Sect, the Jiao Long Ditch, and the water caves of Fuyiao Island, directing the three great demons to infiltrate Tongyezhou…

In the end, whoever’s top strategy or bottom strategy it was, both the Grand Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain and Zhou Mi could accept.

In a wild world devoid of any education, treating the Haoran Jia Sheng as a national hero was truly one of the biggest jokes under heaven. How could Zhou Mi not exhaust himself, planning for the grand trends of Tuo Yue Mountain for thousands of years?

Suddenly, Zhou Mi slightly furrowed his brow, then relaxed it, smiling, “Good old talismans, they’ve caused me two minor nuisances. Sooner or later, I’ll have to settle the score with them.”

At the entrance of a dilapidated palace of the bright moon.

The purple-clad, white-haired old man who had "ascended" here nearly stumbled and fell to the ground, yet his thoughts still stirred. With a roar, he, ignoring his injuries, decisively crushed countless residual talismans with his techniques, causing one golden talisman of the bright moon to suddenly transform into the figure of a scholar, smiling lightly before dissipating. He then cursed, “Dog Jia Sheng, I can’t even pull out a turd for you to eat!”

In order to break free from the constraints of time in Fuyiao Island, the old man held the Taibai sword sheath that Bai Ye had thrown to him. He didn’t hesitate to shatter a wine jar, using half of its heart to repay the favor and desperately protect Bai Ye’s soul, allowing the sage at the peak of Suishan greater control and odds, ensuring Bai Ye’s remaining soul was more intact. As for the other half of the star river, the number of talismans still exceeded four hundred thousand. They intertwined with the celestial star river, forming a bridge of talismans resembling an ascension platform, dragging the old man away from the mortal realm, ultimately arriving at one of the cold ruins of the Haoran Ten-Thousand-Year Forbidden Land, the Moon Palace.

Even so, it was still fraught with danger; had it not been for a sword immortal other than Bai Ye intervening, the old man would likely have been struck down to the mortal realm by a girl with braided horns.

He hadn’t anticipated that Zhou Mi would unknowingly employ some method to conceal a fragment of his spirit within the talisman, trailing all the way here. It was only after the old man had landed that he instinctively sensed something was off and, without a second thought, opted for a “break the pot and throw away the shards” approach, willing to shatter a remaining talisman of his fundamental life object rather than let the slightest possibility appear. The fact proved that the talisman had been a correct gamble.

Zhou Mi even couldn’t be bothered to retrieve the fragment of spirit concealed by She Yue’s light and chose to dissipate along with the golden talisman, lest he be captured by the sage.

Outside the Moon Palace ruins, the talisman user, Yu Xuan, sat down in despair, holding the Taibai sword sheath that Bai Ye had entrusted to return to the Daxu Guanzhu. The old man laughed heartily, “Damn it, I’m done being a hero.”

But the old man quickly stroked his beard and smiled, “To hell with the fourteenth realm; I’m feeling quite good!”

Looking down, he saw his snow-white beard stained with blood, and began to angrily curse at Dog Jia Sheng again.

After cursing, Yu Xuan wanted to rise and leave this troublesome place; unexpectedly, a page of a book appeared out of nowhere, drifting down in front of him.

The old man reached out to grab it, and he was dragged away, as if the talisman user was being taken by a page of the book into the vast star river.

On it were verses: the starry river is bright, as if emerging from within.

Along with seemingly marginal notes: “Yu Xuan, in this, harmonizes with the Dao.”

Standing atop that suddenly vast talisman, Yu Xuan felt as if he were on a grand journey, a celestial being floating upon the sea of stars.

He bowed respectfully at the Dao gate.

Ripples stirred in his heart lake, “Yu Xuan’s celestial aura is very Haoran.”

Yu Xuan laughed, “The Sage praises me; it’s a misjudgment, a misjudgment!”

On the other side of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhou Mi opened the restrictions of his small realm and stepped into the cage of the sparrow on the opposite castle tower.

Zhou Mi chuckled in disbelief; the two sword cultivators seemed to be drinking at opposite ends of the world.

Liu Cha got up first, breaking the restrictions of the cage, returning to the Haoran world in the southern Posa Island. Zhou Mi seemed to imply that since they had already taken three continents, it was time to give that refined scholar a taste of decline, striving to simultaneously capture both Posa Island and East Baoping Island. The battlefield of Posa Island would be entrusted to Liu Cha, who merely needed to consult with Jian Chen’an.

The rest wouldn’t need to be bothered too much.

Chen Ping’an stood up, smiling, “Isn’t it hard to kill the old blind man?”

Zhou Mi surveyed his surroundings and nodded, “He is indeed more difficult to kill than the hidden official.”

Chen Ping’an put away his wine jar and asked, “How can we kill Bai Ye?”

Zhou Mi answered evasively, “You’re a sword cultivator but have yet to see Bai Ye strike. Isn’t that a pity?”

Chen Ping’an said, “In the future, Bai Ye can watch me strike.”

Zhou Mi smiled; this statement from the young hidden official sounded bold and grand. An ordinary person would think it was the arrogance of youth, disregarding even Bai Ye, but Zhou Mi understood it as the essence of the Haoran world’s scholar Chen Ping’an conversing with the Haoran Jia Sheng.

Pity often leads to disappointment.

But I still want to ensure that others are not let down.

Zhou Mi looked at this unfortunate dog who didn’t know whether to call him boastful or innocent, and he patiently said, “That is someone who hasn’t truly faced despair yet.”

Chen Ping’an squinted, matching the slow pace, saying, “Once there was a little girl who, while fleeing from danger, saw her own mother hiding from her husband and daughter, secretly eating steamed buns. The little girl merely stared blankly at that scene; tell me, was she disappointed? Was she hopeless? She can still change, can’t she? Is being a scholar that impressive? Does disappointment only grow larger? I think not.”

Zhou Mi shook his head, “The reasoning is good, but still too small.”

The young hidden official suddenly laughed, “Of course, I’m young and my knowledge is shallow; how could I possibly compare with the grand Zhou Mi of Wenhai?”

Zhou Mi clasped his hands behind his back, “How many of your own will you have to personally kill before you can truly accept your fate and then step by step change the world?”

Chen Ping’an’s expression remained unchanged.

Zhou Mi had already vanished, even his life-bound flying sword, the cage of the sparrow, hadn’t noticed his coming and going.

Chen Ping’an plucked out a talisman to confirm whose realm he was in.

Zhou Mi appeared behind Chen Ping’an, smiling, “So timid; how can you be a hidden official?”

Chen Ping’an put away the talisman.

Zhou Mi remarked, “I’m looking forward to your heroic spirit at the tenth level of martial prowess.”

Chen Ping’an remained silent.

In the Sword Qi Great Wall, the sword immortal spirits that had stepped out from the picture scroll long ago began to form lines. The amount of cultivation Zhou Mi could wear down was uncertain.

Zhou Mi smiled, “The Golden Core has shattered repeatedly, only then did one ascend to the Summit Realm. What of the Nascent Soul? Why not use the fall of a Qi Cultivator to exchange for the stopping point of a pure martial artist?”

Chen Ping’an took a deep breath; if it truly came to that, he would bet half the Sword Qi Great Wall.

This was Chen Ping’an’s last trump card—to exchange a life and half the Sword Qi Great Wall for the Dao of a certain throne. In truth, the value of half the Sword Qi Great Wall remained greatly significant; this trade was unprofitable but intriguing. A great demon of a throne, who would wish to exchange their Dao? The Dragon Lord was probably the most willing, yet he had always been confirming whether the old sword immortal had any backup.

Zhou Mi seemed to be gauging the extent of this young hidden official’s determination.

Finally, Zhou Mi flickered and vanished, first lifting the realm restrictions, then breaking open the cage of the sparrow.

Before returning to Tongyezhou, Zhou Mi went to the castle tower and inscribed the words "Bai Ye" with sword qi.

Not only that, Zhou Mi even dismantled the mountain-water restrictions of the Jiazi camp, allowing the young hidden official to momentarily see the light again.

Chen Ping’an appeared at the cliff’s edge, facing Li Zhen. With the Dragon Lord dead, that half of the Sword Qi Great Wall was left with only Li Zhen, the Hundred Sword Immortal of Tuo Yue Mountain.

They gazed at each other from afar.

Li Zhen’s expression was complex, a smile that seemed genuine but was not.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Eating shit and still so happy?”

Li Zhen quipped, “Want some?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Bring it on.”

Li Zhen stood there dumbfounded, puzzled, “Chen Ping’an, have you been sick in the head since you were little?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “A hungry dog isn’t afraid of sticks; you’re the one who stands out like a sore thumb.”

Li Zhen glanced at the vast land to the south and then turned to look at the northern gate leading to the Haoran world. Finally, he withdrew his gaze and looked at Chen Ping’an, saying, “I’m leaving.”

Chen Ping’an said, “Li Zhen is Li Zhen, Guanzhao is Guanzhao. Does it matter who is who? You don’t even understand who you are right now; where can you go?”

Li Zhen was taken aback. Damn, the hidden official even speaks human language?!

Chen Ping’an added, “You can understand human language now?”

Li Zhen clasped his fists and vigorously shook his head, conceding for the first time.

Chen Ping’an suddenly sat at the cliff’s edge.

Li Zhen did the same, muttering to himself, “Once I leave, Li Zhen will no longer exist. Chen Qingdu is dead, the Dragon Lord is dead—they’re all dead.”

The history of the Sword Qi Great Wall, and even the entire history of sword cultivators, seemed to have been irrevocably split in two—more so than being cleaved by the Grand Ancestor of Tuo Yue Mountain at the tangible Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping’an remained silent, took out a jar of wine, gently tossed it out, and shattered it with his sword qi.

The wine spilled onto the ground.

A long-distance tribute to the Dragon Lord, the sword cultivator from ten thousand years ago, and his two close friends, as they all sought the sword from Tuo Yue Mountain.

——

In the Central Plains, the Yu clan joined forces with the Liu clan of Aihai Island. One provided manpower while the other provided funds, expending the spiritual energy of a beautiful region in the Xuanmi Dynasty, ultimately crafting a great door that crossed from the northern part of Jinjiazhou to this place. Of course, for this to succeed, someone had to draw the sword, and it was the inscriber sword immortal, Qi Tingji, from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Rumors about this elderly sword immortal from a distant land had proliferated in the Central Plains, sprouting like mushrooms after rain. Almost every different sect’s water reports mentioned this sudden appearance of Qi Tingji. All reports nearly unanimously acknowledged one fact: without Qi Tingji’s sword strikes against the demons, Fuyiao Island and Jinjiazhou would have fallen much earlier.

The old scholar was quite enraged at the academy, seeking out the old Yu who was a terrible strategist, demanding some wine to drink, and hoping to see if the old Yu had any unnecessary items.

Pei Qian took Bao Ping to meet Xie Jie, Yu Juanfu.

Jin Zhenmeng and Zhu Mei, these two sword cultivators, were the first to leave the battlefield of Jinjiazhou, retreating northward to the great door, while Yu Juanfu and Pei Qian, pure martial artists, left later.

Finally, only Cao Ci remained in the north of Jinjiazhou.

Pei Qian and Cao Ci exchanged a few rounds of fist fights, but they had to put it on hold for now. Matters had their sizes, and urgency; Pei Qian understood this well.

In the end, the four returned to the Yu family, only to find Lin Junbi nearby. Lin Junbi had previously traveled from the Shao Yuan Dynasty all the way to the Xuanmi Dynasty, staying in the capital for more than half a month. However, Lin Junbi did not disclose any news during this outing. If Yu Juanfu and the others had not returned to the Central Plains, Lin Junbi would have to return to Shao Yuan after another half month.
The Yu clan is the most prestigious and prominent family in the Central Land's Divine Continent, with branches spread far and wide and family trees piled high. Yu Jianfu, the clan's most promising legitimate daughter, is engaged to the so-called "Kirin of the Huai Clan," a match that speaks volumes about her family's expectations.

Lin Junbi, Jin Zhenmeng, and Zhu Mei are all sword cultivators and hail from the Shao Yuan Dynasty. The three share a close bond and currently reside in the Yu estate, home to the "Supreme Emperor of the Xuanmi Dynasty."

Today, Yu Jianfu has taken on the role of a clumsy matchmaker, pulling along her peer, Yu Qingqing, to engage in a game of chess with Lin Junbi. As she watches the two, Yu Jianfu feels they make a perfect pair, truly a match made in heaven. It would be a shame not to have a whole brood of exquisite children from them.

As for the woman in red rumored to be from the Cliffside Academy, Yu Jianfu has only been polite to her, nothing more. This woman is a close friend of Pei Qian, and Li Baoping is merely an acquaintance, so managing those relationships has never been Yu Jianfu's strong suit.

Yu Jianfu leads her companions to the Yew Pavilion, a renowned scenic spot within the Yu estate, famous throughout the continent. The pavilion features a white jade table that serves as a chessboard, with only two stone benches on either side. The spectators stand around, observing with great interest, although there are benches further from the board if one prefers to sit.

The Yu clan's ancestor, a pillar of their vast family, was a child prodigy known for his beauty and scholarly pursuits. This Yew Pavilion was personally crafted by him, Yu Panshui. However, over a century ago, this place was sealed off for three hundred years, all in the pursuit of a game of celestial chess that had never been seen before or since.

A total of one hundred sixty players have taken turns at the chessboard, each allowed only one move. Whether they play white or black is left to chance.

The black pieces began with an exquisite first move but quickly fell apart in the mid-game, leading to a favorable position for the white pieces until a scholar in white robes entered the pavilion, placed a black piece on the board, and declared, "No need to continue."

As everyone stepped into the pavilion, they found themselves surrounded by a tranquil and ancient scene, with towering old cypress trees said to be worth their weight in gold, transplanted from a place called Jinguancheng (锦官城).

As bamboo grows on the Green God Mountain, so do cypress trees in Jinguancheng.

Pei Qian has never been interested in Go, and this has always been the case. As a child, she found it too taxing and unprofitable. Later on, she would watch Old Wei and Xiao Bai clash on the board from the sidelines.

Li Baoping stood quietly behind the woman in red, observing the game without a word.

Jin Zhenmeng and Zhu Mei stood behind Lin Junbi, naturally protecting their own.

If Yu Jianfu hadn't mentioned that her ancestor was a terrible player who only indulged in the aesthetics of the game, Pei Qian might have thought the Yu ancestor could easily win against her junior brother.

In a private moment, Yu Jianfu claimed that even the titles of "child prodigy" and "scholar of beauty" were just embellishments made up after her ancestor became the clan head—he was, in fact, a little gluttonous boy who learned how to make money at a young age.

Yu Qingqing smiled and said, "Junbi's understanding of the game has become ever more refined."

Lin Junbi’s skills had reached an impressive level, having refined her understanding of the game through her visits to the Yu estate in previous years. Back then, her style was all about pursuing the so-called extraordinary and mystical, but now it had evolved into something deep and precise, with intricate connections between her moves. Her killing intent did not overwhelm her strategic understanding, which is why Yu Qingqing could offer such commendation.

While Yu Qingqing might not have been a master herself, she was considered a top player in the Xuanmi Dynasty, though she was still far from the peak experts in the mountains. Yet, her insight was exceptional, earning her the nickname "the Yu clan's interpreter of words."

As Yu Qingqing observed Lin Junbi selecting a piece from the jar, her gaze fell upon the extraordinarily handsome yet focused young man, and she couldn't help but sigh inwardly—when the nation's fortunes rise, so does the luck of its chess players.

In the thriving Shao Yuan Dynasty, Lin Junbi is undoubtedly destined to become a national advisor.

One day, Lin Junbi’s understanding of chess will reach the level of "pure connection, soaring high." Not every proficient player can achieve greatness outside of the board, but this former youth seems to connect the path of enlightenment with chess, sprouting and flourishing.

Yu Jianfu and Pei Qian sat side by side, with Yu Jianfu kicking off her shoes, sitting cross-legged, and handing Pei Qian a flask of wine.

Pei Qian quickly gestured to Yu Jianfu, subtly tilting her chin toward the serious-looking sister Baoping.

Yu Jianfu chuckled and began to drink, her curiosity piqued—aside from her master, did Pei Qian actually have someone she feared?

Stretching lazily, Yu Jianfu leaned back against the railing, her voice lowering as she said to Pei Qian, "Cao Ci has thrown many punches on the battlefield between the two continents; it has a lot to do with your master’s rise to the summit."

Once inside the pavilion, Pei Qian remained upright, hands resting lightly on her knees, nodding slightly.

Yu Jianfu continued, "The Cliffside Academy is quite famous now, all thanks to that great Lihua Tiger."

Pei Qian, however, was reluctant to discuss the Lihua Tiger and merely smiled, "I've known Sister Baoping for a long time. My master said she wore red dresses since she was little."

Yu Jianfu nodded.

Though she still didn't quite understand why Pei Qian was so close to the woman in red, she didn't press for details, just as Pei Qian never mentioned Huai Qian in her presence.

Yu Jianfu sipped her wine, occasionally glancing at the chessboard, knowing she couldn't discern the outcome regardless. She could play Go, but only at a basic level.

She preferred Xiangqi (Chinese chess) instead; the Yu clan's library housed an original manuscript of the "Xiang Jing" penned by a master of military strategy.

Those who cultivate on the mountains think deeper and plan for the long term, but aside from military practitioners, most cultivators tend to favor Go over Xiangqi.

Yu Jianfu asked, "Can you play Xiangqi?"

Pei Qian shook her head. "I've never played."

In their youth, Old Wei and Xiao Bai often played Xiangqi, but there was a time when they mocked her junior brother.

After a moment of thought, Pei Qian recalled the exact words, each one etched in her memory.

One particularly sharp remark stood out: "The depth of Xiangqi is like the capacity for drinking of Wei Xian; how can you two not feel ashamed?"

Of course, Yu Jianfu was unaware of this incident and casually remarked, "Among the ten young candidates, there’s a young man named Xu Bai who is very skilled at Xiangqi. His reputation as 'Xu Xian' is partly due to this. When he was younger, he dreamt of entering the ancestral grounds of the military family and played ten matches against an ancient master named Jiang, who had been hidden away for thousands of years. Xu Bai won four and lost six, which made him quite famous among the peak experts even before he became one of the ten young candidates. Before he was known as 'Xu Xian,' he was already nicknamed 'Young Jiang Taigong.'"

Yu Jianfu took a sip of wine. "If I get the chance, I must seek his counsel. Losing is inevitable; I just hope it’s not too humiliating."

Pei Qian was even less interested in Xu Bai or Xu Xian, so she said, "I’ve only seen talismans with the Elder Xuan; they were indeed very wondrous."

The poet Bai Xian, the lyricist Su Xian, and the talismans of the fairy realm.

Xu Xian in Xiangqi?

Pei Qian suddenly smiled wide. "In that case, if I were your Yu clan's ancestor, I would secretly hide away those more than a hundred black and white pieces, engraving the names of the players. They would be both a treasure and extremely valuable."

Yu Jianfu gave her a strange look.

Pei Qian asked, "Has this already been done?"

Yu Jianfu sighed, "If only we could swap places."

Pei Qian shook her head.

She wouldn't want to trade.

By the time Lin Junbi and Yu Qingqing finished their game, nearly half an hour had passed, and they would need to review their moves.

After asking for permission from Yu Jianfu, Pei Qian took Sister Baoping to stroll around.

Once they were a distance away, Li Baoping ruffled Pei Qian's hair and said, "When you're with friends, there's no need to be so stiff."

Pei Qian thought for a moment and nodded. "I’ll listen to you, Sister Baoping."

Li Baoping continued, "You just returned from the battlefield in the Golden Armored Continent; it’s normal to feel tense at first, but you can’t stay that way. When we traveled far with Uncle Shi, he would occasionally take it easy; after all, you’re still a disciple."

Pei Qian murmured, "Even if my master takes it easy, it’s to gather strength and spirit; it’s not the same."

Li Baoping smiled without responding.

Suddenly, the old scholar appeared, accompanied by a child wearing a tiger hat. The old scholar laughed heartily and introduced the child, "You can call her Sister Baoping or Sister Pei."

The child looked sideways at the old scholar, who responded with a frown, "I’ve had a bit too much to drink; it’s no wonder. As for Old Yu, well, he may not say much, but the wine he has treasured for years is quite potent."

The old scholar then handed Pei Qian a delicate bamboo paper-cutting knife, inscribed with poetic verses on both sides, saying, "Pei Qian, this is a gift from the esteemed Yu elder. Accept it, no need for formality; when an elder gives, don’t refuse. It’s a small item, but to the Yu elder, it’s nothing to worry about."

Just as Pei Qian was about to speak, she tugged at Li Baoping's sleeve. With a scratch of her head, she accepted the remarkably precious knife, realizing it was something of value. Without it, she would be troubled about how to take it home. After all, she had promised to return it to Sister Xi after leaving the Golden Armored Continent.

The old scholar then mentioned he needed to leave for Sui Mountain.

Throughout the conversation, the old scholar never revealed the name of the child in the tiger hat.

Once the old scholar departed, Li Baoping and Pei Qian also left the Yu residence.

Li Baoping was returning to the Academy, where students from the Cliffside Academy were currently studying, while Pei Qian was finally back home after years of travel. However, she had to cross over to the Aijia Continent first and then take a detour to the North Julu Continent before heading back to the Baoping Continent.

Li Baoping handed the narrow knife to Pei Qian, who only had a sword-raising gourd hanging from her waist, her red dress billowing as she left.

Pei Qian stood at the doorway, calling out to Sister Baoping. Li Baoping turned, her eyes squinting with a smile, suddenly bursting into a radiant grin, lightly stomping her feet and waving her hands excitedly.

Pei Qian scratched her head, feeling a bit too childish for such a display.

After standing at the door for a while, Pei Qian finally turned and returned to the estate, asking a steward for help in delivering her thanks and farewells to the Yu clan's ancestor. The steward smiled and agreed.

After meeting with the Yu ancestor and then bidding farewell to Yu Jianfu, she was to be escorted to the celestial ferry. Pei Qian brought along the nameless disciple she had named A Man, but upon reaching the ferry, Yu Jianfu suddenly decided that since Pei Qian was heading to the Thunder Temple, she would tag along to see if she could ask the senior Pei Axiang for advice on martial arts.

At the Yu elder's private garden, beneath a plaque reading "Wooden Wild Fox," Yu Panshui stood next to a handsome young man in white robes.

Yu Panshui rubbed his hands together with a smile, saying, "Thanks to Brother Qi's presence, my fortune has improved; the old scholar today was gentle."

The young gentleman who was temporarily staying with the Yu clan was Qi Tingji, who had failed to save Zhou Shenzhi in the Water Cave of Fuyun Continent, but later managed to slay the old man Yan in the Golden Armored Continent. Although the ascendant from that place had likely not perished entirely, this merit had undeniably been credited to the old sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The local ascendant from the Fuyun Continent held Qi Tingji in high regard and had promised to drink together once he emerged from the White Porcelain Cave in the Liuxia Continent.

The term "old sword immortal" refers to Qi Tingji's time in cultivation, where he became renowned, but he actually looked quite young. Qi Tingji rose to fame in the Central Land before becoming well-known across the continent, yet he suddenly disappeared. Rumors suggested that the Liu family's fortune-teller from the Aijia Continent had offered Qi Tingji an extravagant sum to serve as their clan's "Supreme Honorary Elder." The Liu family's riches were beyond imagination, making Qi Tingji a guest of honor in their clan.

The merits accumulated on the battlefield between the two continents were enough for Qi Tingji to establish his own sect in the Haoran world.

However, he hesitated; once he took root in Haoran as a founding master, it would mean abandoning the Ascendant City and the Fifth Heaven, with the two major paths leading to Fuyun and Tongye Continent likely falling apart in a few years. Reports regarding Ascendant City from the Haoran world were nearly nonexistent; otherwise, they were filled with baseless rumors.

When the old scholar previously sought him out, Qi Tingji had deliberately avoided him, inadvertently missing the child in the tiger hat.

Yu Panshui didn’t dare to name names, but with a few stutters, Qi Tingji could guess the outcome of the battle in the Fuyun Continent— the Confucian Temple must have paid dearly.

Yu Panshui chuckled, "Liu Jubao is wealthy and fierce; he’s more generous than I am. Without spending a dime, I've managed to have Brother Qi as a nominal guest elder of the Yu clan. The friendship of gentlemen is as light as water."

Qi Tingji smiled in response.

Yu Panshui then grew serious, asking, "How do you plan to respond to the Liu family?"

Qi Tingji replied, "I want to meet this Liu financial god first."

Yu Panshui nodded. In the garden, flowers suddenly bloomed, and moments later, a tall, elegantly dressed middle-aged man appeared among the blossoms, walking into the pavilion to greet Qi Tingji with clasped hands, "Liu Jubao, greetings to Sword Immortal Qi."

Qi Tingji returned the gesture.

Yu Panshui chuckled, "You two chat; I’ll go see a junior and see if I can coax him into marrying into our Yu clan."

Liu Jubao smiled faintly.

Yu Panshui snapped his fingers, and a wisp of green smoke appeared, coalescing into a graceful beauty who followed the Yu ancestor.

In a study room.

Lin Junbi crossed the threshold as a celestial realm cultivator gently closed the door behind her.

Inside the study, only an elderly man sat with his back to the window on a chair.

Lin Junbi took a few steps forward and performed a bow.

In the Yew Pavilion, she had made her seat; here in the study, however, she would have to stand.

The Yu clan ancestor, slouching with one leg crossed, looked like a wealthy old man dressed in fine clothes, portly, with squinty eyes that made his face appear larger and added a hint of greasiness.

It was hard to imagine that this elder, possessing only the cultivation of the Jade Purity realm, could support the rise of the more powerful Xuanmi Dynasty after the fall of the Dazheng Dynasty. Both the Dazheng and Xuanmi ranked higher than the current Shao Yuan Dynasty.

In the dimly lit and somewhat desolate study, since the elder remained silent, Lin Junbi simply stood still.

Finally, the elder spoke, chuckling, "I hear you’ve become quite the skilled player; you’re about to surpass your teacher."

"Junbi's chess skills are still not as solid as yours, esteemed sir."

"That’s a greasy remark; I was asking about wins and losses, not style. By your logic, I must dominate over the Lihua Tiger in chess, right? Is that amusing?"

"Junbi and you have each won and lost."

"The boy is clever; his ambitions are higher than his skills. The Shao Yuan national advisor taught a good disciple."

"One must get what one deserves. For what one does not deserve, even if given, I would return it."

"And how do you intend to return it? As if personal feelings and reputation are wealth—so greasy, so very greasy. At such a young age, you’re already thinking about the world with such oiliness, more so than the ways of the world."

"I act within the rules; I ask my heart and do my things."

"You went to the Sword Qi Great Wall with the intention of seeing Yu Jianfu, didn’t you? Were you disheartened and retreated, or do you still hold hope, planning to play the long game? This question is not easy to answer; you either admit to ulterior motives or acknowledge your teacher’s heart is too dark, making moves on the board with black hands. So why not let me give you a reason: a graceful lady, a gentleman makes a good match? Isn’t that more refined?"

The elder clasped a jade pendant that was cold as ice, lightly carved, with only two deep engravings, one reading "Yuxuan" and the other "Zhuo."

He exhaled, switched to holding it with both hands, twisting it gently, and then habitually rubbed it against his face.
Lin Junbi chose to ignore the comments, saying, "Yu Jianfu doesn't think highly of me, so I don't think I'm suitable for Yu Qingqing." 

Yu Panshui chuckled, "Silly girl, how did you end up falling for Chen Ping'an?" 

Lin Junbi countered, "Then why doesn’t Yu Jianfu think highly of the Hidden Official?" 

Yu Panshui squinted, raising her wrist and lightly grasping the air. In the next moment, a seal appeared in her palm, which she pinched between her fingers. 

The inscription on the seal read: "A stone in the stream, how can it not be the pillar of the midstream? The beautiful clouds in the sky, the fist still remains up there." The imprint said: "Goddess of martial arts, beside Chen Cao." 

Yu Panshui asked, "You lost to this person in chess? Do you know who he is?" 

Lin Junbi replied, "It's enough that Mr. Yu knows." 

Yu Panshui lifted another jade object in her hand, saying, "If you insult this fellow a bit, I’ll give you this. Heaven knows, Earth knows, you know, I know, what’s there to fear if I don’t say it, and you don’t say it? Just a reminder, this item in my hand is a relic from the Water Painting Garden, equivalent to half the Water Painting Garden. Not only would you want it, even your master wouldn't find it lacking." 

This item came from the Old Pit Blessed Land, a rare stone known as Tain Huang, considered the essence of the mountain roots of the Old Pit Blessed Land, a unique treasure of that place, worth its weight in gold. One tael of Old Pit stone is worth one tael of Valley Rain coins, and there’s a saying that "the best seals and inkstones in the world are half from the Old Pit Blessed Land." 

It is a well-known source of wealth, giving control to a lower sect of the Xuanshan Sect. 

Xuanshan has five sects on one mountain. It holds one top-tier blessed land, one small cave heaven, and two medium blessed lands. Among them, the Yunmeng small cave heaven has a grass lake, and just the Jiaolong Cave has several, with countless water spirits, particularly prized for their gentle temper, making them favorites among the fairies of the mountain. 

Thanks to the chaotic reports from the Haoran world, many must-have items for the fairies were selected, such as dragon maiden fairy clothes, the "pearl in hand" bracelet starting with twelve Qiu pearls, a dressing mirror crafted from the Liuli Pavilion of Baidi City, a replicated scroll praised as "next-level true relic" of the cloud-plastered or floral scrolls, a jade spring vase from the flowing clouds continent, and a plum blossom branch from the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land… 

How could Xuanshan not have wealth? How could there be a lack of talismans? 

Even Yu Panshui, the ancestral head of the Yu clan who controls the entire treasury of the Xuanshan Dynasty, felt somewhat inadequate. 

At this moment, the renowned Liu Da Caishen from the Aiai Continent had previously offered to buy half of the Old Pit Blessed Land from Xuanshan. It was said that Liu Jubao was carrying a pile of small items at that time, all filled with Valley Rain coins. Besides the mountain of celestial coins, Liu was also willing to give half of his own Green Shade Blessed Land to Xuanshan. 

Xuanshan simply did not agree. 

What does it matter if you, Liu Jubao, are wealthy? Do I look like someone who is short on money? 

Ultimately, talk of half of the Old Pit Blessed Land, half of the Green Shade Blessed Land, and Liu Jubao offering money to Xuanshan is merely superficial. It’s like a marriage alliance among the clans below the mountain. 

In truth, the Liu clan from Aiai Continent was merely trying to latch onto a big leg, but both sides could indeed make a fortune together in the long run. 

A business where one side profits while the other suffers cannot last long; it's merely a "flowing" source of income—here today, gone tomorrow. 

Lin Junbi seemed to have prepared for this, without hesitation, she chastised "Cui Dongshan" thoroughly, as if reciting a script. 

Yu Panshui burst into laughter, clearly delighted, tossing the jade object to Lin Junbi, who tucked it into her sleeve and said, "It’s a pity that I couldn’t turn the stone into a square seal." 

Yu Panshui turned to say, "Later, tell that embroidered tiger." 

A cool voice sounded, "The servant obeys." 

Lin Junbi continued to keep her eyes straight ahead, ignoring the conversation. 

There were too many rumors about this Yu clan ancestor, and her temperament was just one of them. 

Yu Panshui suddenly asked, "That young Hidden Official, can he truly make you, Lin Junbi, respect him?" 

Lin Junbi nodded, "I cannot help but admire him." 

Yu Panshui chuckled, "Shall we have a game of chess?" 

Lin Junbi replied, "The outcome will be decided by Mr. Yu." 

Yu Panshui shook her wrist, putting the seal back in its place, and stood up, saying, "Let’s go to the Yinglei Pavilion for a game; that boy talks big, acting like he can beat me." 

At the ferry terminal in the capital, Pei Qian and Yu Jianfu boarded a celestial ferry heading to the Aiai Continent. A Man stood at the viewing platform railing, staring blankly as the grand capital shrank to palm-sized, then to a speck, before finally disappearing from sight. 

Pei Qian asked, "You better practice the punches you owe from yesterday; otherwise, you’ll owe me a snowflake coin." 

The child merely stood on tiptoe, gazing into the distance. 

Pei Qian was neither angry nor scolding, simply saying, "According to our agreement, if you miss two days of training, you owe me half a snowflake coin. If you miss three days in total, it’s the full amount." 

Finally, the child mumbled, "Just a little longer." 

———— 

Chen Lingjun finally broke free from the oppressive air of the mountainous land at the estuary near the Spring Dew Garden, emerging with a tremendous force—like a giant dragon plunging into the sea, creating massive waves. 

Just as Chen Lingjun was about to push forward, taking advantage of the momentum to surge hundreds of miles, he suddenly lifted his enormous head and spotted a figure in a green robe standing at the bow of a ship in the distance, hands clasped behind him, looking remarkably relaxed. Then, amidst the tumultuous waves, the figure instantly reverted to his original form, tossing spells in all directions, unable to contain the raging waters, which tightened Chen Lingjun's heart. 

Along the banks of the great river, thousands of miles near the estuary, several celestial masters were already helping to suppress the water flow to prevent it from spreading ashore and harming innocents. Yet, unexpectedly, there was still a fish that slipped through the cracks—Chen Lingjun caught sight of the young celestial master who was left dumbfounded in the end. 

Fueled by a surge of anger, Chen Lingjun flailed his bloodied tail, altering his trajectory and diving deep into the ocean, smashing his entire head onto the seabed. 

Stones, cliffs, bridges, banks—everything on land belonged to the dragon. The invisible road of the river obstructed the dragon's path; it demanded a relentless forward drive, frantically drawing in water momentum. Amidst the torrential floods, the faster it moved, the easier it became. However, Chen Lingjun faced numerous obstacles, pushing through with great effort until he finally exhausted himself completely. If it weren’t for a small boat blocking his path, he could have surged out at least a thousand miles into the sea. 

Dizzy, Chen Lingjun shook his head, realizing that it was no longer beneficial to continue into the ocean. Enduring the pain throughout his body, he condensed into human form, rummaging through his belongings for clothing to wear. He grabbed a bamboo box and a walking stick, stumbling toward the drenched figure, looking around to find the drenched chicken, whose upper body was draped over an overturned boat, shouting, "What a flood! What’s going on?!" 

Seeing that the person was unharmed, Chen Lingjun sighed in relief and then, overwhelmed with mixed emotions, couldn’t help but burst into tears. 

"I’m never going near water again in this lifetime, no matter what anyone says! Not even when the master speaks!" 

After a few loud cries, Chen Lingjun suddenly sat on the water's surface, breaking into laughter. Stumbling and swaying, he felt that somehow, he had finally succeeded in crossing the river. If only his good brothers, Jia Laodao and Bai Mang, were here, he could have shared a drink from the river with them. 

Chen Lingjun wiped his face and noticed the young qi cultivator, who was just at the Cave Dweller level, finally managing to flip the small boat back over. The cultivator crouched there, pouring seawater back into the ocean, probably having exhausted all his spiritual energy trying to fend off the giant waves with his clumsy spells. 

Chen Lingjun felt a pang of guilt; enjoying the scenery had turned him into a drenched chicken. 

Above the sea of clouds, Li Yuan covered his forehead, "My brother Lingjun, swimming through water—has he lost his mind? How can one swim like that?" 

His success in crossing the river had only turned a golden dan dragon into a mere nascent soul. This was not the outcome that Li Yuan and Shen Lin had initially anticipated regarding the nascent soul bottleneck. 

For cultivators, reaching the nascent soul stage was vastly different from achieving a perfect nascent soul. Even within the same realm, the difference was as vast as heaven and earth, and for those like the dragon, climbing to higher realms was even more difficult. Moreover, could crossing the river be done repeatedly? When the opportunity was lost, it was lost for a lifetime. 

Originally, according to the predictions of the Duke of Longting and the Duke of Lingyuan, as long as Chen Lingjun succeeded in crossing the river, the worst outcome would be reaching the peak of a perfected nascent soul. If he were lucky, he might directly break through the nascent soul bottleneck and ascend to the upper five realms—this was not without possibility. 

Yet somehow, Chen Lingjun had conjured up such a dismal scene for himself. 

Li Yuan began to worry about his own future; Chen Ping'an wouldn’t blame him for failing to protect the path, would he? 

The water god of the Nanxun Palace, the current Duke of Lingyuan, Shen Lin, stood alongside Duke Longting Li Yuan, smiling, "I actually think this isn’t bad. I’m starting to understand why Chen Ping'an is so willing to take care of Chen Lingjun." 

Li Yuan still felt pity for his good brother's lost path, "Being a good person truly costs a lot." 

Li Yuan frowned, asking, "That young qi cultivator who seems so out of place—could it be that he suddenly appeared here and caused Chen Lingjun to drop half a realm, truly only a land immortal?" 

Shen Lin looked worried, "Aside from the cultivators at the Spring Dew Garden on the shore, there are both our water officials patrolling the sea. It shouldn’t be possible for anyone to appear in this area." 

Further away, a thousand miles away, there was actually a fishing immortal from the Luoshui Pit. According to both parties' predictions, after Chen Lingjun surged the river’s waters into the sea, he would temporarily find rest in the water mansion opened up for that purpose, to stabilize his foundation and replenish his energy. 

A plump woman in a green robe suddenly appeared beside the two great dukes of the river, saying, "The master asked me to convey a message: you don’t need to investigate that person’s origins; let him be." 

"Moreover, if anyone pries into his background, such as from the Da Yuan Chongxuan office or the Water Dragon Sect, and tries to test the waters with you, you should advise and deter them. If you can’t stop them, just give me a shout." 

The woman smiled, "To flood the infant mountain and the Thunder God’s estate, what great ambition Duke Longting has!" 

Li Yuan chuckled, "Madam Dan, you flatter me." 

This woman, a great demon from Luoshui Pit at the Ascended Realm, called herself "Madam Dan." 

She particularly enjoyed climbing the ranks among the most favored in the mortal realm. It was said that outside the gates of Luoshui Pit hung a golden couplet: "Strike the bell of the azure sky, step on the waves of Luoshui." 

What does it matter if you’re at the Ascended Realm? What does it matter if Bai has written a poem for Luoshui? Look at you, so full of yourself. If you really have the ability, why not challenge my good brother, the Fire Dragon True Man? 

The woman smiled as she left, unable to resist glancing at the young qi cultivator on the sea, 

Although she appeared calm on the surface after manifesting, she was actually quite anxious, feeling it was no better than encountering the Fire Dragon True Man. 

The one who slays dragons. Killing water spirits would be even more effortless. 

Chen Lingjun was quite clever, casually finding an excuse to join that fellow in cursing the strange water currents here. Soon enough, they began calling each other brothers, and unexpectedly, that fellow turned out to share his surname, Chen, and was named Zhuoliang—a name that could rival his good brother Bai Mang’s. It was clear he was a failed scholar. Chen Lingjun burst into laughter, "You share my surname, I share your surname; doesn’t that make us cousins from five hundred years ago?" 

Chen Zhuoliang smiled slightly. 

Earlier, he had stumbled upon a broken secret realm and casually found a piece of a celestial’s shed skin, returning it to the young coachman from Beiju Luozhou. 

The coachman "Bai Mang" received a bag of celestial coins, while Chen Lingjun managed to achieve a successful crossing, rather than ending up with nothing to show for it. 

Once the crossing succeeded, regardless of the ferocious winds and rains ravaging both banks, Chen Lingjun would find it easy to ascend to the Jade Purity Realm, rather than remaining as a nascent soul dragon. He would take on the form of a true dragon. However, "Chen Zhuoliang" could not help but feel the urge to strike first, repay debts, and then chop off his good brother's head. 

Moreover, if Chen Lingjun had chosen to crash into the boat and kill the passerby in order to achieve greater Dao success, "Chen Zhuoliang" would have had an easier time. 

Chen Lingjun felt he was not the kind of person to randomly recognize brothers or chop off heads. After bidding farewell to Chen Zhuoliang, he mainly wanted to hurry and thank Li Yuan and the Duke of Lingyuan, then find Bai Mang and head back home together. 

However, as Chen Lingjun made his way back, he visited the Longgong small cave heaven to thank his good brother Li Yuan. After wandering around the Spring Dew Garden, he still couldn’t find Bai Mang, but he did encounter the cousin who was squatting and eating turtle jelly at the Spring Dew Garden ferry terminal. What a coincidence! It would be too regrettable not to recognize a friend, and as a result, they hit it off even better. Chen Zhuoliang pulled out an old money bag, looking like he was trying to play rich, made Chen Lingjun feel a pang of sadness. He heard that Chen Zhuoliang wanted to take a chance in the Ghostly Abyss, since the capital city of Jingguan no longer had the upper five realm spirit. Opportunities were now everywhere. Upon hearing this, Chen Lingjun decided to go along, but he still intended to gather more information about Bai Mang. 

Unexpectedly, Chen Zhuoliang turned out to be quite generous, accompanying him around for a full ten days. The money bag was half empty, leaving only enough for the ferry fare. When Chen Zhuoliang said he had to leave for something, Chen Lingjun, still searching for Bai Mang, could only ask the Spring Dew Garden to help keep an eye out before he and Chen Zhuoliang boarded the ferry to the Bone Strand. 

Li Yuan, standing by the great river, gazed at the ferry and suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. 

He saw the scholarly figure in the green robe squinting and smiling at him, while Shen Lin immediately performed a greeting. It was at that moment that Chen Zhuoliang turned and left. 

After touring the Bone Strand together and discussing various matters, Chen Lingjun finally managed to convince Chen Zhuoliang not to go to the Ghostly Abyss to become a wild cultivator but instead to enjoy a good life in the Baoping Continent! 

However, as the Pima Sect’s ferry crossed the sea and reached the Changchun Palace terminal, Chen Zhuoliang suddenly suggested going to the Niujiao Mountain terminal. Chen Lingjun agreed to meet him at Luoluo Mountain, then headed south alone. 

Upon arriving at the Niujiao Mountain terminal, as soon as his feet touched the ground, Chen Lingjun couldn’t help but wipe away a torrent of bitter tears. 

Hanging up the sword talisman and riding the wind to his mountain gate, he saw Cao Qinglang. Chen Lingjun laughed heartily, striding towards Cao Qinglang, "Qinglang, it’s been years! Have you still not made any progress? That won’t do!" 

Cao Qinglang stood still, nodding slightly, smiling without speaking. 

Chen Lingjun asked with a grin, "While I’ve been away from Luoluo Mountain, has anyone bullied you? Just tell me; nowadays, it’s just a matter of me giving them a slap." 

Cao Qinglang shook his head, "No one has." 

Chen Lingjun felt a bit disappointed but quickly started climbing the mountain, noticing that Cen Yuanzhi was not diligent in his training. 

Soon, Chen Lingjun spotted the little girl in black, patrolling the mountain with a stern face, holding a golden shoulder pole and leaning on her walking stick, standing still. 

With some sunflower seeds as hidden weapons, she jumped and twisted her waist, shouting "Get out of the way!" as she threw one of her projectiles. 

As she patrols the mountain, "get out of the way," she had no trouble overpowering the flowers and trees, leaving them all dazed. 

With Pei Qian away, the Right Protector truly was invincible on Luoluo Mountain. 

Chen Lingjun cleared his throat, "Xiao Milai." 

Zhou Milai froze in place, then rushed over, holding her golden shoulder pole and walking stick, shouting, "Jingqing Jingqing Jingqing!" 

Hearing this name, which could only be heard on Luoluo Mountain, Chen Lingjun’s eyes turned red all of a sudden. Xiao Milai timidly asked, "Did someone bully you? Who? If they can beat me, I’ll go fight them; I’m not afraid even after traveling far down the mountain." 

Chen Lingjun laughed, ruffling Xiao Milai’s hair, bending down to ask, "Is the master not home yet?" 

Zhou Milai nodded, "The road is so long; the kind mountain master must be taking his time." 

Chen Lingjun hummed in agreement. 

He let Xiao Milai lead the way to find that silly girl, Chen Nuanshu, while he first went to the Zushi Hall at Jisefeng to pay his respects. 

Along the way, Xiao Milai shared stories about home, and finally whispered, "The good mountain master’s senior brother, the Great Sword Immortal, misunderstood you at first, worrying you would bully Sister Nuanshu…" 

The little girl had not noticed the spirited Chen Lingjun, who was now trembling, stuttering as she asked, "Left… or right?" 

Zhou Milai gently nodded, proudly saying, "Don’t worry; I clarified the truth, and the Great Sword Immortal even laughed." 

Chen Lingjun felt as if he had been struck by lightning.
Rumor has it that the Great Sword Immortal never smiles, and that must hold some deep significance. Even if he finds me unpleasant to look at, he should at least spare me a glance, right? What’s the matter with the Great Sword Immortal? Can’t he show a bit of reason?

Chen Lingjun suddenly felt a wave of sorrow wash over him. He pounded his chest and stomped his feet, wailing in despair. Here I am, having finally succeeded in my transformation into a dragon, and now all I’ve done is replace a punch with a sword strike?

Since reuniting with Chen Nuanshu, Chen Lingjun had been feeling somewhat under the weather. However, upon reaching the Master Hall at Jisefeng, he took a deep breath, left his bamboo box and walking stick at the door, and stepped over the threshold.

After that, Chen Lingjun quickly regained some of his composure. He went to Gray Mist Mountain to find his little brother Yunzi, or to Huanghu Mountain to seek out Hongxia.

By sheer coincidence, all three of the dragon-like creatures had successfully navigated their paths to enlightenment one after another.

Luopo Mountain indeed had an air of being close to the water.

In truth, Hongxia held a very good impression of Chen Lingjun, partly out of selfishness. She felt that when the sky falls, as long as Chen Lingjun is there to take the first hit, everything would be fine...

However, Hongxia’s cold and reserved nature made it difficult for her to express her emotions, and her overly cautious demeanor at Huanghu Mountain made her seem distant and polite compared to Chen Lingjun.

When it came to cowardice, Hongxia, who was quietly constructing a water palace at Huanghu Mountain, was far more timid than Chen Lingjun, who was at Luopo Mountain. It wasn’t that Hongxia was truly weak; a giant python of Huanghu Mountain, which could vie for opportunities in the Lihua Cave's path with “Little Loach,” definitely wouldn’t have a good temper.

Chen Lingjun had even scolded Ruan Qiong to his face. That was back at the blacksmith shop by the Longxu River, right in Ruan Qiong’s territory. Would his own lord dare to do the same? Absolutely not.

Of course, Chen Lingjun would admit his mistakes and had bowed his head to Ruan Shengren more than once. But that blacksmith, Ruan, didn’t make too much of it; he just looked a bit displeased at the time.

On this day, Chen Lingjun was playing by the cliffside stone table with his brother Yu Mi and little Mi Li. He had his only little brother, Yunzi, reveal his true form, his head resting on the cliff’s edge while his body dangled from the steep wall. Little Mi Li closed her eyes, leaned to the side, and threw punches nonstop until she sent that giant python tumbling down the cliff… This had become a daily ritual. As for Yunzi’s thoughts, he probably felt like he wanted to die. It wasn’t that he was troubled by playing around with the mute lake monster; it was that the smiling sword immortal with the melon seeds made him quite uneasy.

Just as Yunzi was about to slip off the cliff, he suddenly noticed the strange smile on the green-clad “Yu Mi.” He turned his head and found a familiar stranger with a known aura on the other side of the cliff.

It was a tall young woman, similarly holding a walking stick and carrying a green bamboo box on her back.

Little Mi Li's eyes widened as she stared for a long time before running over to her. The little girl looked up and murmured, “Where’s Pei Qian?”

She was still a small girl in black clothes, looking at the Pei Qian in front of her, yet asking where the familiar Pei Qian had gone.

Pei Qian had grown so tall that even Zhou Mi Li, who used to often tiptoe to talk, had forgotten to do so now.

As soon as the words left her mouth, Little Mi Li realized she had made a mistake, lowering her head and scratching it in embarrassment.

Pei Qian reached out and pressed down on Little Mi Li’s head, asking, “And the melon seeds?”

Zhou Mi Li hugged Pei Qian tightly, bursting into tears, choking back sobs, and quietly complaining about how Pei Qian had grown so tall before finally coming home.

———

After returning to Luopo Mountain, Pei Qian found that a little mute boy named A Man had appeared on the mountain, but he was not close to anyone. Eventually, Pei Qian sent him to the Dragon Riding Alley to work as a little assistant.

Mi Yu, alias Yu Mi, was a sword cultivator at the bottleneck of the Jade Purity Realm.

Cui Wei, who had gone down the mountain to travel, was a Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator.

Sui Youbian, who was planning to take over the Sword Worship Platform, was a Golden Core Sword Cultivator.

According to the previous sayings on Baoping Continent, there were three sword immortals: the Sword Immortal, the Great Sword Immortal, and the Old Sword Immortal.

Chen Lingjun, Hongxia, and Pei Xiang—two water dragons and a fox spirit—totaled three Nascent Souls.

Yunzi had succeeded in his transformation and made less noise than Hongxia; he had only traversed the Longxu River and Tiefu River, achieving the Golden Core stage.

There were many, many changes both large and small.

All of this left Pei Qian feeling somewhat disoriented.

That day, Pei Qian walked to the Sword Worship Platform on foot. Once, there had been a beautiful female sword cultivator, Huang Ting, from Taiping Mountain on Tongye Continent, who had taught Pei Qian a technique called the White Ape Sword Art along with the Drag Sword Technique.

However, all these years, it had just been bamboo swords and bamboo blades meant for play.

That would no longer be the case.

At the Sword Worship Platform, Pei Qian found Sui Youbian, who was living and cultivating there.

Now that Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator Cui Wei had gone to the Nanyue Region, and Jiang and Zhang Jiaozhen had moved to Luopo Mountain early on, it was quite peaceful.

Sui Youbian was pleasantly surprised to see Pei Qian.

It was truly hard to connect the composed young woman in front of him with that mischievous and clever little girl from years ago.

Moreover, he couldn’t associate the girl who cried at the slightest provocation with the pure martial artist standing before him now.

Even though he had heard some stories about Pei Qian practicing martial arts from Nuanshu and Mi Li, like her penchant for jumping off cliffs, Sui Youbian still couldn’t believe it.

Pei Qian clasped her fists in greeting and called out, “Sister Sui.”

Sui Youbian nodded with a smile.

Pei Qian got straight to the point, saying, “I remember my master lent you a sword, right?”

Sui Youbian squinted her autumn water-like eyes and asked, “What do you mean?”

Pei Qian smiled and said, “Sister Sui, you’re a sword cultivator with your fated flying sword, so why not lend me the Heart Sword for a bit?”

Pei Qian patted the narrow blade at her waist and laughed, “I have a blade but lack a sword. I’ll return it to Sister Sui soon; at most, in three years.”

Sui Youbian shook her head, “Go find another sword elsewhere. That Heart Sword won’t be loaned out. Let your master come collect it himself.”

Pei Qian chuckled, “It’s not like I won’t return it.”

Sui Youbian simply fell silent.

Pei Qian asked, “Sister Sui, do you know why I have a good relationship with the old chef, Old Wei, and Little White, but my relationship with you is the most formal?”

Sui Youbian began to frown.

Pei Qian answered her own question, “Because my master isn’t the scholar you envision. And don’t think my master will ever become that person.”

Sui Youbian’s expression turned indifferent, “Are you looking to challenge the Sword Worship Platform?”

Pei Qian replied, “What’s wrong with that? It’s just a spar. No one’s going to die.”

Zhu Lian appeared outside the cottage, letting out a long sigh without entering. “Pei Qian, don’t be so aggressive; we’re all family here. Even if there’s some resentment, it shouldn’t come before reason.”

Pei Qian didn’t turn her head, “Are you my master?”

Zhu Lian was left speechless.

It was truly a dilemma.

Zhu Lian knew that this day would eventually come; he just didn’t expect it to arrive so soon.

The worst course of action would be to throw a punch and block Pei Qian.

The middle course would be to shield Sui Youbian from harm, getting beaten by both Pei Qian and Sui Youbian in the process.

As for the best course, there was still one.

A woman in a snow-white robe appeared beside Zhu Lian.

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment before turning and clasping her fists.

Chang Ming scoffed, “With high-level boxing skills comes great reasoning. Truly worthy of being the first disciple of the Luopo Mountain master.”

Pei Qian narrowed her eyes.

Chang Ming casually laughed, “Your master asked me to tell you that you can keep everything except for the chestnuts. Whether you listen or not is your business; I just need to deliver the message.”

Pei Qian was skeptical.

Chang Ming seemed to remember something, “Your master added that you shouldn’t grow too fast.”

Pei Qian suddenly felt a bit guilty, scratching her head unconsciously.

She sat on a small bamboo chair under the eaves, gazing at the old chef, wanting to say something but hesitating.

Zhu Lian waved his hand with a smile, signaling Pei Qian not to take it to heart.

In any case, he found it hard to deal with Sui Youbian, whom he found equally displeasing.

Chang Ming said, “I’ve already noted the matter of the Sword Worship Platform with the mountain master today.”

Pei Qian nodded, “Likewise.”

Zhu Lian and Chang Ming left together.

Sui Youbian asked, “Pei Qian, let’s put our grievances aside for now. What’s going on with your state of mind?”

If Pei Qian had come to the Sword Worship Platform today throwing a tantrum or acting like the scheming little black coal girl she once was, Sui Youbian would have lent her the sword. The Heart Sword truly belonged to Chen Pingan, and as Pei Qian, the first disciple, she had the right to borrow it for three years, even to take it back.

Pei Qian crossed her arms and said, “You know full well.”

On this side of the thatched cottage, there was only one bamboo chair, clearly indicating that Sui Youbian did not welcome outsiders at the Sword Worship Platform.

So, once Pei Qian sat on the bamboo chair, Sui Youbian had to stand.

However, Pei Qian finally seemed somewhat familiar with the situation.

Sui Youbian began to smile.

Pei Qian surprisingly started to doze off.

But moments later, Sui Youbian sighed internally, how good it is to “sleep the body but not the spirit,” practicing boxing is almost like Dao.

Is Pei Qian now in the far-travel realm or the mountain peak realm?

Pei Qian seemed to be deeply lost in her thoughts, yet she opened her eyes and spoke, “The fifth day of May at Shujian Lake is an unusual day. Sister Sui, you’re truly a sword cultivator of the True Realm Sect, you should know that, right?”

Sui Youbian nodded, “If I remember correctly, Chen Pingan was born on the fifth day of May.”

“You can call me ‘Pei Qian, your master,’ don’t just refer to my master by name,” Pei Qian reminded her first, then pulled out a bag of roasted chestnuts and a local snack called Five Poisons Cake, with centipedes, toads, and scorpions all made from wooden molds.

She offered them to Sui Youbian, who shook her head.

Pei Qian ate half the bag of chestnuts, finished the piece of Five Poisons Cake, put away the rest of the chestnuts, and clapped her hands, saying, “There are some words that have been swirling in my head, and I can’t seem to get rid of them. If I don’t practice boxing, I’ll feel restless. I thought returning home would ease that, but it only grew worse, and I couldn’t even practice boxing anymore. I was worried about Nuanshu and Little Mi Li, so I had no choice but to come to the Sword Worship Platform for some fresh air.”

Sui Youbian laughed, “Am I easy to bully? The most outsider-like here at Luopo Mountain?”

Pei Qian said, “Sister Sui is from the same hometown and is an elder, so it’s only right that Sister Sui has the final say.”

Sui Youbian asked, “What sort of words could cause a peak martial master to feel unsettled?”

Pei Qian replied, “I saw a prohibitive tablet in the countryside of Jinjia Continent. A very ordinary object, nothing strange about it.”

Not wanting to elaborate further, Pei Qian took her leave, bowing slightly as she did.

Sui Youbian sighed, “No need for such formality. You need to take care of yourself.”

Back at the cliffside bamboo building on Luopo Mountain, Pei Qian sat sideways, gazing out at the sea of clouds.

Little Mi Li lay on the stone table, staring blankly at Pei Qian.

Chen Nuanshu was busy with needlework, helping Little Mi Li mend her boots. The table was piled high with a small wooden tray full of various items.

A little incense boy who had hurried to Luopo Mountain for a meeting spotted the unfamiliar figure from a distance and couldn’t help but angrily shout, “Who dares sit alongside our Right Protector?! This infuriates me; what merit do they have...”

Pei Qian turned her head, slightly raising her eyebrow, “Hmm?”

Without waiting for Pei Qian to act, the little fellow suddenly fell to the ground, exclaiming loudly, “I am now temporarily taking on the role of the Right Protector of the Dragon Riding Alley, paying my respects to the Lord of the Guild. Over the years, I’ve been diligent in my duties, undeterred by wind or rain, and my efforts have not been in vain…”

Without Pei Qian making a move, that little guy was pulled to the stone table, where he, a minor incense boy from Longzhou City, was now more servile than the Left Protector of Dragon Riding Alley, crouching on the table with a voice slightly choked, “Lord Pei, I have been waiting for you to come back like a star in the sky. The wasp nests on Qidun Mountain have grown quite large and need to be dealt with. Everything is ready, just waiting for Lord Pei's sword technique…”

Chen Nuanshu tilted her head slightly, biting off a thread, unable to help but laugh at the incense boy's pretentiousness.

Little Mi Li cleared her throat, reminding the incense boy that it was time to tone it down.

Pei Qian looked at Little Mi Li, who grinned and blinked at her.

Pei Qian turned her gaze back to the incense boy and said, “From this moment on, you are formally inducted as the Right Protector of Dragon Riding Alley in our bamboo building's ledger. Remain humble and diligent, and keep up the good work.”

Pei Qian told Zhou Mi Li, “Quickly go fetch that ledger, and remember to bring paper and pen.”

Zhou Mi Li jumped up, “Understood!”

The incense boy beamed, overjoyed. Finally, he was on the path to success. Moreover, having heard the Right Protector of Luopo Mountain mention it in previous years, it seemed that one day, Pei Qian would even establish the position of the Grand Protector of Dragon Riding Alley.

That night, Pei Qian descended the mountain alone and encountered the mountain climber Cen Yuanzhi along the way.

Pei Qian stood aside, waiting for Cen Yuanzhi to climb past before continuing down the mountain.

Cao Qinglang moved a bamboo chair for Pei Qian.

Once they both took a seat, silence hung between them for a long while. Finally, Cao Qinglang said, “It feels like such a long time has passed.”

Pei Qian gently nodded.

Cao Qinglang didn’t know what to say, and with Pei Qian remaining silent, he had no choice but to fall into silence again.

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “Do you know about the prohibitive tablets?”

Cao Qinglang replied, “In the past, there were quite a few outside the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom. Now, in the vast world of Haoran, there are even more.”

Ordinarily, with Pei Qian’s excellent memory, she shouldn’t have needed to ask this.

Pei Qian continued, “On my travels, I saw a tablet in a village.”

Cao Qinglang was puzzled but didn’t question further, simply waiting quietly for Pei Qian to continue.

Pei Qian slowly said, “It only wrote one sentence: ‘No drowning of female infants, nor of male infants born on the fifth of May.’”

Pei Qian clenched her fists, gazing into the distance with a calm expression, “My junior brother showed me a time-lapse scroll, but I still can’t reconcile the master from my childhood with the master I know now. I can’t understand why this world insists on not letting my master return home. Do they all want to die? And why am I learning boxing so slowly, far too slowly!”

Cao Qinglang looked into the distance with Pei Qian, softly saying, “Pei Qian, don’t think of yourself as at fault, as if that would bring your master home. And don’t think that if your master scolds you or even expels you from the sect, as long as he comes home, you wouldn’t care. As disciples seeking knowledge, whether our master or teacher is present or not, we must have our principles and things we refuse to do.”

Pei Qian sighed and stood up.

Cao Qinglang remained seated, saying, “Pei Qian, your master has always hoped you wouldn’t rush to grow up, but he doesn’t mean you shouldn’t grow at all. At Luopo Mountain, your master thinks of you the most. In my view, anyone can disappoint your master, but you cannot. Do you know why I have never held too much resentment towards you all these years? It’s not because I’m magnanimous or patient. Back then, when your master took an umbrella and brought me to the school, after we left the alley, your master handed the oiled paper umbrella to me and asked me to wait for a moment. In truth, he snuck back once to see you. When he returned, I will always remember how he looked; after reclaiming the umbrella, he lowered his head as if he wanted to convey some reasoning to me but ended up saying nothing. At that moment, your master was truly heartbroken. But I still can’t understand what your master wanted to say back then and why he was so sad.”

After that, the master’s disciple, the teacher’s student, sat on the bamboo chair in silence for reasons unknown.

Pei Qian stood up first.

Cao Qinglang hesitated, wanting to speak but pausing.

Pei Qian asked, “What if I reach the martial artist's limit before my master?”

Cao Qinglang pondered for a moment and replied, “At that time, I’ll ask your master to help you train.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 854: Everything is Ready, Only the Wind and Snow are Missing

As Pei Qian ascended the mountain, she gripped a bamboo yellow paper-cutting knife tightly in her hand. With her thumb gently pressing against the knife's handle, she slowly slid the blade out of its sheath, then carefully pushed it back in. 

Although it appeared to be a simple paper-cutting tool made from the ancestral bamboo of Mount Qing, if wielded against an enemy, it could serve as a formidable treasure, capable of overwhelming demons and spirits, thanks to the bamboo's origin from the Bamboo Sea's celestial realm.

At that moment, Cen Yuangji happened to descend the mountain, and Pei Qian paused, stepping aside to let her pass while discreetly tucking the bamboo knife into her sleeve.

On the summit's steps, Zhu Lian and Mi Yu sat together, sipping wine. Zhu Lian watched the scene unfold and sighed, "Even if she were to traverse the same paths of the martial world she once walked, there will never be another little girl with blackened cheeks, adorned with talismans, who mutters 'walk boldly, and the demons shall tremble.'"

In Mi Yu's memory, Pei Qian was still that quirky little girl he had encountered at the Sword Qi Great Wall—full of mischief and unrestrained. So when he reunited with her at the Desolate Mountain, he was genuinely taken aback. His surprise was not unlike that of Sui Youbian.

After ascending the mountain, everything Mi Yu knew about Pei Qian came from casual conversations with Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Mili. Of course, little Mili, who often patrolled the mountains with Mi Yu, had shared even more. Every morning, without fail, a little girl clad in black would stand as a guardian at his door, waiting quietly without a word of impatience. Mi Yu had once advised her against waiting outside, but the girl had replied that waiting for someone was a joyful thing, and seeing them immediately afterward brought even greater happiness.

Such a simple and innocent statement from little Mili almost brought tears to the eyes of the carefree sword immortal who had been lounging in his hometown for centuries.

After Cen Yuangji reached the mountain gate, she wiped the sweat from her forehead and took a moment to rest. Sitting next to Cao Qinglang on a bamboo chair, she softly remarked, "Pei Qian has changed so much?"

Cao Qinglang nodded with a smile, not saying much more. He didn't even need to turn around; he knew Pei Qian must be glancing back towards the foot of the mountain. If he said even a single word, it would end up on the ledger.

Mr. Lu had once said that many children grow up in an instant, while others remain like children, simply growing old with white hair. At the time, Cao Qinglang couldn’t quite grasp it.

On the summit steps, Mi Yu took a sip of wine and suddenly said, "Compared to Mili and Nuanshu, I can't say I particularly like Pei Qian, though I certainly don't dislike her."

Zhu Lian nodded, "That's quite normal. Pei Qian is too clever; oftentimes, excessive intelligence is like a blade without a sheath—wielding it can harm others, and holding it can harm oneself."

Mi Yu self-deprecatingly added, "To be honest, having Pei Qian, a pure martial artist, at Desolate Mountain gives me an inexplicable sense of security."

Desolate Mountain had few rules, but each one was significant. Mi Yu had grown accustomed to a leisurely life, where the only task he was good at was passing swords. It was inevitable he felt somewhat constrained. If Pei Qian were to descend the mountain first and avoid reasoning with others, he would only need to follow and ask who she was fighting, which would be rather exhilarating. Otherwise, when the Hidden Official returned home, it would seem he, Mi Yu, had merely been idling at Desolate Mountain for years, which was rather shameful. After all, very few sword immortals could withstand the words of the Hidden Official.

Zhu Lian chuckled, "Sword cultivators and martial artists aren't scholars. One uses flying swords to behead while the other employs fists for combat; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Both seek the freedom of unrestrained existence. I've had many discussions about this with the young master long ago..."

Mi Yu felt a headache coming on. He raised the wine jug and said, "You all talk amongst yourselves. No matter what conclusion you reach, don’t tell me—I have a headache."

Zhu Lian continued, "Yuanji and Qinglang are among the few clear streams of Desolate Mountain. Their presence represents the mountain's integrity."

Mi Yu asked with confusion, "What do you mean by that?"

Zhu Lian smiled without answering.

Suddenly, Mi Yu understood, clapping his hands in realization. "That makes sense!"

Pei Qian didn’t head towards the bamboo pavilion but continued her ascent on foot. 

The bamboo yellow paper-cutting knife given to her by the Yu family elder and transferred by the Confucian elder had been a great help. Otherwise, as Pei Qian traversed three continents upon her return home, she would have been burdened by a literal mountain of baggage, many items of which would have needed to be stored with Yu Juanfu. The principle of not revealing wealth was a tacit agreement between the master and disciple. With this item in hand, Pei Qian could clear out her belongings, assisting in moving as ants do when they relocate their nests. Currently, her belongings included artifacts from the battlefield of the Golden Armored Continent and sixty-nine items she had salvaged from the demon cultivators.

Previously, in the Lei Gong Temple of Ma Hu Mansion on the Aiai Continent, Pei Qian had unearthed an iron spear from a jade purity realm demon cultivator, which was a semi-divine weapon. Initially given to her by the old immortal, she had broken its two sharp ends using the “Godly Person’s Drumming” technique, transforming it into three weapons: two blades and an iron rod. Coupled with the Thunder Law refinement from Lei Gong Mountain, the weapon was slightly diminished in quality but not significantly so, ultimately giving Pei Qian an extra half of a semi-divine weapon.

The sight had left Pei Axiang dumbstruck, wondering if this girl named Pei had lost her mind. However, Pei Qian had planned to offer one of her treasures as compensation for the assistance from Lei Gong Mountain, and Pei Axiang, not wanting to nitpick, graciously declined, suggesting that in the future, practitioners from Lei Gong Temple and Desolate Mountain should spar more to cultivate their martial arts. If they happened to meet in the martial world again, perhaps they could look out for each other; as fellow disciples, they simply needed to exchange names to become friends.

Pei Qian, brimming with excitement, asked, "Senior Pei, is that truly possible?"

Pei Axiang smiled, "Why not? Does Desolate Mountain look down on Lei Gong Temple?"

After Pei Qian slightly resolved her mental block regarding the forbidden monument, she reassessed her journey across the four continents and realized she had indeed accomplished things, rather than being entirely unproductive. 

She had helped bridge the once-estranged mountain peaks of Desolate Mountain and Ma Hu Mansion’s Lei Gong Temple.

Furthermore, the seven upper-stage Qi cultivators and thirty-one Earth Immortals who had withdrawn from the battlefield alongside her, along with more who had fought by her side, all recognized Pei Qian from the Baoping Continent—a young woman who had once reached the peak realm in the central region of the Golden Armored Continent, and was the first disciple of a certain mountain's master. She was courteous in her interactions and lacked any of the traits of a poorly brought-up individual; her fists were only ever aimed at formidable foes on the battlefield.

As for who that certain person was and where that mountain stood, Pei Qian kept it to herself, unwilling to disclose too much for fear of bringing unnecessary trouble to her master and Desolate Mountain. The old cook had once advised her that even a pure martial artist could attract unforeseen troubles, which could only be resolved by those at the distant travel realm or even peak realm.

This was akin to her master’s teaching, "In the martial world, I will step back two or three realms as a sign of respect."

As she approached the summit, with several steps still to go before reaching the old cook and Mi Yu, Pei Qian stopped to clasp her fists. It was primarily out of respect for this sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall, who had yet to pay respects at the Ancestor Hall on the Zhi Color Peak. Otherwise, Pei Qian wouldn’t need to be so meticulous about the formalities. 

Then Pei Qian tossed the paper-cutting knife to Zhu Lian, gathering her voice into a line, and detailed to the old cook the method to unlock the forbidden monument.

Zhu Lian immersed himself in thought for a moment, then smiled, "With over seventy treasures from the mountains, won't we have a solid victory against Li Huaiwen in the future?"

Pei Qian gently shook her head.

Such childish antics from her youth would surely not return. Perhaps growing up meant that the amusing events of childhood would line up one by one, losing their charm.

Pei Qian stopped gathering her voice into a line for private words with the old cook and directly said, "Aside from the paper-cutting knife itself, I will keep the two blades and the iron rod; the rest can be confiscated. Please ask Mr. Wei to appraise their quality and estimate their value. Sell what should be sold, and keep what should be kept—feel free."

Zhu Lian asked, "If I'm not mistaken, you haven’t given any gifts to Nuanshu and Mili yet."

Pei Qian smiled, "I was prepared in advance; it won't be a problem."

Zhu Lian nodded, "Very well, it's settled then. In a few days, there will be a significant event at the Lotus Root Blessed Land, which is about to be promoted to a superior blessed land. Don't rush to descend the mountain just yet. Master Zhong will soon return to the mountain, and we will go together to the blessed land. Besides Lord Wei and Island Master Liu, Old Dragon City’s Fan Er and Sun Jiashu will also come to witness the ceremony. Everyone will bear witness to the elevation of the blessed land’s status."

Pei Qian replied, "No problem."

As Pei Qian was about to turn away, Zhu Lian suddenly said with a grin, "The Sword Immortal Mi says he doesn’t like you very much."

Pei Qian responded, "Oh? As long as Senior Mi sincerely likes Sister Nuanshu and Little Mili, that is enough for me."

Mi Yu wore an awkward expression, as if covered in yellow mud, unsure whether to laugh or cry.

Pei Qian clasped her fists again toward both of them before taking her leave.

As she turned towards the bamboo pavilion, Mi Yu helplessly said, "Zhu, you really aren't being fair."

Zhu Lian chuckled, "It’s better to clear the air. Do you think Pei Qian isn’t aware of this? Do you think she cares whether Brother Mi finds her pleasing or not?"

Mi Yu sighed in relief, "I was simply being too sentimental."

Zhu Lian consoled him, "It’s a well-known fact that those who are sentimental often bring upon themselves distress. This feeling is one that the heartless can never understand."

That night, at the bamboo pavilion, Pei Qian sat alone by the cliff, her feet dangling over the edge. 

Little Mili, unable to sleep, decided to forgo it altogether. She picked up her golden shoulder pole and green bamboo staff, arriving early at Pei Qian's door, where she stood, dozing off while waiting for dawn.

Her ears perked up, and Zhou Mili immediately opened her eyes, spotting a snowflake coin on the ground. Shaking her head to clear her vision, she quickly looked around, furrowing her brows, before dashing over to pick it up. She jumped up and spun around, gently tossing the snowflake coin into Pei Qian's yard. With a soft clap, she completed her task. 

As Zhou Mili turned around, she was surprised to find another snowflake coin on the ground. This time, the little girl crouched down, her bottom in the air as she circled around, confirming that this new coin was likely a sibling lost from the first one. Zhou Mili propped her chin up with her hands, staring intently at the coin; it was too strange—money fell from the sky upon Pei Qian's return home. She needed to ponder this further. Meanwhile, her golden pole and hiking staff teamed up with the little girl in black to create a small nest for the snowflake coin, lest it sprout legs and run away. After all, Pei Qian had once sternly claimed that coins could indeed sprout legs and visit others.

Someone from above called out, "What’s happening? There’s money on the ground?"

Zhou Mili, like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey, dove onto the snowflake coin and then suddenly laughed upon realizing it was Pei Qian sitting on the courtyard wall. Little Mili immediately jumped up, clutching the snowflake coin, ready to take credit, when Pei Qian pinched one of the coins between her fingers, shaking it lightly, and sternly asked, "Who threw money at me just now? Little Mili, did you see who it was?"

Zhou Mili vigorously shook her head, "I didn’t see anything! I swear, what if it was Sister Nuanshu passing by and picking up money? Who knows? I was standing at the door dozing off and suddenly found myself on the ground, not knowing at all."

Pei Qian asked, "Would Sister Nuanshu throw her things around?"

Zhou Mili quickly corrected herself, "It must be Jingqing! He always claims to view gold and silver as dirt... It has to be Jingqing who ate so many of your roasted chestnuts, Pei Qian, and felt too embarrassed to pay, so he secretly came to deliver money. Ah, Jingqing means well, but I guess it’s my fault for not watching the door..."

Pei Qian jumped down from the wall, and together with Zhou Mili, they headed back to the bamboo pavilion. Sitting together at the cliff's edge, the little girl in black eventually grew too sleepy and rested her head on the young woman’s lap, dozing off.

As dawn broke, first with a glimmer of light from Mili, then bursting into brightness.

After Pei Qian departed, Zhu Lian obtained the bamboo yellow paper-cutting knife and immediately visited the accounting room, finding Wei Wenlong. They calculated the value of the items within Pei Qian’s spatial treasure. However, some of the treasures had unclear origins and strict prohibitions, and Wei Wenlong, given his lower realm, couldn’t accurately gauge their quality and price. He worried about accidentally undervaluing them at the Jiao Horn Mountain’s baggage station, where outsiders might take advantage. Even if Desolate Mountain eventually chose to keep them, they couldn’t ignore their rarity and let them gather dust, as that would leave Wei Wenlong unsettled. Everything needed a precise price to bring him peace of mind; whether it was a resale for profit or keeping them for a future high price wasn’t as important. 

Wei Wenlong enjoyed the process of making money.

Thus, Zhu Lian had to request the assistance of Chang Ming, who was firmly established as Desolate Mountain's "Master of Regulation." Certain aspects of wealth and fortune were indeed beyond reason.

Chang Ming helped Wei Wenlong fill in the gaps and re-evaluated three items that had been mistakenly identified as top-tier spiritual artifacts. However, several more mountain treasures remained whose true value Chang Ming couldn’t ascertain.

Finally, Chang Ming provided a final estimate for the sixty-nine mountain treasures—it was a sky-high price. 

It had to be calculated in terms of Gu Yu coins and came with a thousand-character note.

Chang Ming chuckled, "One matter settled at a time; the Sword Testing Platform records a minor fault. This must be a major merit for Pei Qian. As far as I can see, aside from the master, Pei Qian has put in the most effort for Desolate Mountain’s profits."

Zhu Lian rubbed his hands and smiled, "After all, she is the first disciple of our young master."

Zhu Lian then asked, "Why don’t I call in Wei and Mi to confirm? Chang Ming’s total estimate is undoubtedly accurate; at most, it’s a discrepancy of a hundred Gu Yu coins. However, when it comes to specific items, it still feels a bit lacking. Once confirmed, we might even gain an extra two or three hundred Gu Yu coins."

After all, Chang Ming's estimate was merely the calculated value of the seventy-odd items themselves. In mountain trade, especially with the younger generation of sect-born immortal masters, the more youthful they were, the more money they seemed to have at their disposal, spending lavishly depending on their preferences.

Considering the increase in Desolate Mountain’s fortune, Chang Ming was in high spirits and joked, "You seem to care quite a bit about Pei Qian."

Zhu Lian’s carefulness stemmed not just from wanting Desolate Mountain to earn more Gu Yu coins, but ultimately, he didn’t want Pei Qian to suffer any losses.

Zhu Lian laughed heartily.

Moments later, aside from Desolate Mountain’s head steward, the Master of Regulation, and the accountant, two more familiar faces arrived—Sword Immortal Mi and the ever-dedicated Lord Wei, who was always ready to assist.

Wei Ban examined the numerous mountain spiritual artifacts one by one, particularly intrigued by a bizarre stone mill and an unassuming square cloth.

Wei Ban smiled broadly, noting that since there were two of them, they should be treated as a pair of treasures, representing an ancient script long lost in the vast world of righteousness—one inscribed "Jin Fa Cao" and the other "Si Zhi Fang." Moreover, due to the absence of a "Tea Duel" custom in Zhu Lian’s hometown of Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he would never have allowed Wei Ban to seize an opportunity. Because when it came to culture—music, chess, calligraphy, and painting—Zhu Lian was indeed a true expert.
Wei Wenlong learned of the underlying secrets and immediately turned to Zhu Lian. Without needing Wei Wenlong to voice his thoughts, Zhu Lian already had his hands clasped behind his back, seemingly prepared, and immediately blurted out, “On both sides of the tea mill, let me add a couplet.”

“The grinding sound rings clear, each has its own law, allowing the strong to stay on the right path, I am the Law Master of the Golden Department.” 

“Strings and zithers harmonize, surrounded by the four mountains, enabling the weak to walk this path safely, let us share a laugh in the spring breeze.”

“As for this square scarf, I can inscribe a couplet as well, or let Mr. Cui write it in running script. In the scorching summer, with a feather fan and a silk handkerchief, under the cool shade of green trees, lounging on a bamboo chair, with a light makeup of red sleeves, sipping tea as the gentle breeze stirs, the stream flows, brushing against the green mountains, while the moon hastens, and the stars fall upon our shoulders. A few white clouds drift by the ferry, and a bird's call echoes in front of the mountain. Truly, what a beautiful place with good mountains, good waters, good tea, and good-hearted people.”

Wei Wenlong nodded, saying, “With this, not only will the two items not be sold separately, but valued as treasures, the price must also double to be fair.”

Mi Yu stood dumbfounded at the side. 

Damn, can you really make money like this? How did you all manage to sync up so well? Wasn’t I the one who came to Luopo Mountain with my brother Wenlong?

Fortunately, Mi Jianxian's trip tonight wasn't in vain. Two of the items, which had fallen in quality to top-grade spiritual artifacts, had been elevated back to genuine first-rate treasures.

Among them was a long sword without a sheath, inscribed on either side with the words “Fine Brow” and “Moon Halo.” This sword had once belonged to a sword immortal of the demon race in the wild, a beloved possession of theirs. Later, as their cultivation improved, it became somewhat useless, so they passed it on to their most trusted disciple in swordsmanship. Eventually, it changed hands multiple times, losing its lineage and legacy, to the point where even the sheath had disappeared. However, this long sword, known not for its immense killing power, was rumored to possess a true marvel: the Moon Halo sword light could condense into a puppet sword attendant named “Fine Brow,” a woman in both voice and appearance. This technique, “casting a mold from the law,” was drawn from a local female sword immortal of the wild. In the present day, she would equivalently possess the combat strength of a Dragon Gate realm sword cultivator. For a certain sword immortal master of the fifth realm, such a female puppet would only be a pleasure to the eyes, but for any earthly immortal cultivator, once in combat, the sudden appearance of a companion with strength equivalent to a Golden Core cultivator, who was entirely unafraid of death and capable of multiple “soul reincarnations,” would be a game changer.

Mi Yu held the sword in one hand, flicking it to create a sword flower, while with the other hand, he gathered some moonlight at his fingertips and gently pressed it against the sword hilt, then began to “wash the sword” with both the moonlight and sword energy.

The sword light flowed together with the moonlight, cascading down to the ground. In an instant, a woman with fine brows stood gracefully before everyone, dressed in a snow-white robe filled with clouds and mist.

Her expression was cool, her eyes somewhat blank, eventually gazing at Mi Yu, her movements stiff as she performed a deep bow.

When Mi Yu retracted all the sword energy, the woman’s form dissipated, returning to the long sword.

Mi Yu placed the sword back on the table and picked up a previously dull and worn-out magical robe. He held it near the window and gently shook it. In an instant, golden and emerald colors shimmered in tandem, resembling the eyes of peacock feathers, becoming brilliant under the soft moonlight.

Mi Yu then revealed a hidden secret. This magical robe, though heavily damaged, was meticulously woven using the “Cloud Banner Silken Weave” technique, a treasure from the Golden Emerald City of the wild. The foundation of Golden Emerald City was built on the dragon robe that the great demon king revered, embellishing it to ensure that the city, predominantly inhabited by female cultivators, could withstand the rampant invasions of many great demons.

Mi Yu smiled, “When illuminated by sunlight and moonlight, the intersection of gold and emerald colors will become translucent, shimmering like ripples on the water. The two types of water-pattern light that emerge from the robe during day and night are quite different, known as ‘Dividing Waters of Yin and Yang.’ At night, the water route flows swiftly and gently, while during the day, it is clear and bright, allowing certain practitioners of esoteric techniques, who should not expose themselves during the day, to refine both day and night. Thus, the Rainbow Pavilion in Beiju Luzhou has a similar foundation; both rely heavily on magical robes.”

Wei Wenlong and Wei Shanjun cautiously inquired, “If the City God and the spirits of the Civil and Military Temples were to wear this robe, wouldn’t they be able to roam the mortal realm in broad daylight, appearing as ‘humans’?”

Wei Bo nodded, “Of course. However, we cannot grasp the true secret techniques and restrictions of Golden Emerald City, making it difficult to create a genuine Golden Emerald robe. Aside from the Day Wanderer, who is responsible for daytime patrols, the effects for the other City Gods and various officials are not significant when wearing such robes.”

Wei Wenlong nodded, his thoughts racing, and slowly said, “The most valuable aspect of this robe is still the woven technique it contains. Even if we cannot access the foundational laws of Golden Emerald City’s robe-making, as long as we have even a slight connection, we won’t have to worry about sales. Even if, as Wei Shanjun said, the effects are minimal, it is still beneficial if the Night Wanderer can leave the office even a moment earlier at the transition of day and night. Having some extra funds to show off to colleagues is also a good thing…”

As he reached this point, Wei Wenlong’s tone noticeably faltered.

In the domain of the Northern Mountain, the immortal masters in the lineage of the Xu family might be somewhat reasonable, regardless of whether they were truly poor or not; they would still dare to lament their hardships with their brothers in times of trouble.

But in the entire Northern Li region, all the spirits of mountains and rivers were officials under the jurisdiction of Puyun Mountain. Who would dare to claim they had extra funds? Would anyone dare to go to Puyun Mountain and ask Wei Shanjun for a few cups of fine wine? The key was that everyone was pitifully meek, lacking even the courage to bemoan their poverty.

Wei Wenlong had to quickly change the subject. “We can make a deal with the Rainbow Pavilion. Friendship is friendship, but business is business. We can use this ‘ancestor’ robe and a piece of Golden Emerald City’s weaving technique to split the profits later, easily asking the Rainbow Pavilion for thirty percent of the profits. Since we’ve managed to break down the weaving technique, it can’t be hidden; outsiders will surely imitate it soon. Therefore, the Rainbow Pavilion will need to launch hundreds of these robes all at once and will likely get help from Pima Sect, Floating Duck Sword Lake, or Taihui Sword Sect to sell them together. At that point, once other immortals buy a few to dissect the techniques, they will all follow suit. We can’t possibly stop this from happening; it’s not like we want to cut off their financial paths. This is merely a way to build a tacit understanding between both parties. However, if a large immortal mansion like the Qionglin Sect in Beiju Luzhou wants to sell these robes openly, they will have to consider the joint accountability of our collective powers.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “There’s no need to trouble Taihui Sword Sect and Floating Duck Sword Lake for this deal. After all, it’s a matter of friendship and not worth it. We’ll have Brother Mi make a trip to the Rainbow Pavilion, where he can serve as a nominal offering. If the Qionglin Sect dares to sell the robes, Mi Jianxian will simply ask the Sword Refining Mountain for guidance. If trouble arises, Brother Mi can take his sword and go find someone to drink with, whether it’s Sect Leader Liu or Sect Leader Li; it won’t be a problem—just a way to avoid the spotlight.”

Mi Yu smiled broadly, “That sounds great!”

Zhu Lian admitted, “But in doing so, we’ll be relying on the goodwill of the Rainbow Pavilion towards the nominal offering of ‘Mi Yu.’ We must also be careful not to implicate the Rainbow Pavilion.”

Mi Yu laughed, “What use is ‘Mi Yu’ collecting goodwill? It’s meaningless. As for the ladies of the Rainbow Pavilion, I can’t bear to let them suffer any harm. Before drawing my sword, I will always think it through carefully.”

Zhu Lian glanced at the Golden Emerald robe and the “Fine Brow” long sword on the table, softly asked, “Daoist Changming, Mr. Wei, besides offering a reasonable thirty percent profit, I also intend to gift this sword to Xu Xingjiu, a Qi practitioner from Cloud City, as a protective item on behalf of Luopo Mountain. What do you think?”

Cloud City was actually part of the southeastern trade route in Beiju Luzhou, and while it was somewhat of an afterthought, it always felt somewhat powerless. This was because Cloud City, whether in terms of sect foundation or the realms of its cultivators, was far inferior to larger immortal families like the Pima Sect or Chunlu Garden. Even compared to the Rainbow Pavilion, it seemed less connected to Luopo Mountain in terms of finances. However, the city lord, Shen Zhenze, along with his two most trusted disciples, Dao partners Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan, held a very friendly and close relationship with Luopo Mountain. They were willing to invest substantial efforts and resources without ever pretending to be something they were not. Even Wei Bo remarked that such mountain allies were priceless and could not be bought with gold.

Additionally, the wandering Mr. Yu had left his direct disciples just outside the Rainbow Pavilion and took the unnamed disciple Zhao Shuxia to Cloud City together. After all, the Rainbow Pavilion was a bit too perfumed with feminine energy, and the old man wanted to avoid unnecessary assumptions.

The wind at “Wine Asking Peak” began with the young mountain lord of Luopo Mountain and then expanded. The first outsider to join was Xu Xingjiu from Cloud City, a newly advanced Nascent Soul sword cultivator, closely followed by Liu Zhiqing. Afterward, on the way south to the Pima Sect, a warrior and a sword immortal made a special trip to the Pima Sect, with the warrior being Wang Fuxue, the old warrior who had once gone mad during his training. The old man, encountering a few heartfelt words from the younger Li Er, received a good beating and fortunately managed to drink with the accompanying sword immortal at Wine Asking Peak, where they uttered the phrase, “Asking about the sword and fist at Pima Sect is no match for asking about wine at Wine Asking Peak.”

With the push from both Wang Fuxue and the sword immortal, Wine Asking Peak became a current “unruly trend” in Beiju Luzhou, to the point where Li Cai, upon returning to Beiju Luzhou, did not first return to Floating Duck Sword Lake but instead directly brought wine to Pima Sect. Luckily, Liu Jinglong had already gone on a long journey, so he escaped this calamity.

Daoist Changming asked, “Is this a long-term business or a matter of goodwill?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “It’s purely a matter of goodwill, not involving trade.”

Daoist Changming replied, “Then I have no objections.”

Wei Wenlong nodded, “I second that.”

“I will discuss the old matters of Cloud City in detail with both of you later.”

Then Zhu Lian turned to Mi Jianxian.

Mi Yu was quite cheerful; today was indeed an auspicious day. He finally managed to help Luopo Mountain a little, and he would remember to jot it down. At that moment, he grinned, “Likewise, likewise.”

After the conversation, Mi Yu momentarily felt as if he had returned to the summer retreat palace.

Daoist Changming took his leave first, with several sword talismans crafted by the Longquan Sword Sect dangling from his waist, almost resembling a keychain belonging to the little steward Chen Nuanshu. Since there was nothing to do on the mountain, Daoist Changming was just buying for fun, and in the future, when more disciples were present in the Patriarch Hall, she could distribute them according to the rules.

Daoist Changming had a close relationship with Ruan Xiu, so the Longquan Sword Sect likely had informed her in advance, thus they both turned a blind eye to it. Moreover, every time Daoist Changming spent money on sword talismans, she followed her own established rules, doubling the price each time, and she was reluctant to spend immortal money, always using her self-cast gold coins in exchange.

Ruan Qiong was famously unfriendly towards Luopo Mountain. In the past, only Pei Qian was an exception, and now Daoist Changming could be considered a half exception; though they still had no smiles for each other, they occasionally nodded when they met on the mountain.

Finally, Zhu Lian said to Wei Bo, “It’s rare for you to grace us with your presence, old rule: melon seeds and wine?”

Wei Bo laughed and asked, “Rare?”

Zhu Lian replied with a smile, “Isn’t this to highlight your status as the mountain lord?”

Wei Bo and Daoist Changming successively displayed their abilities and departed from Luopo Mountain.

Zhu Lian handed the magical robe and long sword to Mi Yu, “Thank you, Brother Mi, for making a trip to Beiju Luzhou.”

Mi Yu reminded, “Brother Zhu, when the Hidden Official returns to the mountain, be sure to send a message to the Rainbow Pavilion immediately via flying sword.”

Zhu Lian smiled and promised.

After Zhu Lian left Wei Wenlong’s quarters, he took a solitary walk around Luopo Mountain, heading towards the old mountain god temple at the peak, still uncertain about how to properly handle it. This location at the summit of Luopo Mountain had many taboos.

He missed his brother Da Feng a bit; solitary joy is not as good as shared joy. Many key pages in the immortal texts were lightly folded at the corners, and this was Zhu Lian's understanding of consideration.

In the past, every time Da Feng borrowed books from the mountain, a gentle shake would reveal the quality of the books—good or bad—just by looking at the number of folded corners.

Da Feng hurried up the mountain and hurried down even faster.

As dawn began to break, Zhu Lian descended towards the bamboo house and saw Pei Qian and Zhou Mili, a large and a small figure.

Zhu Lian treaded lightly and sat beside them, noticing that Little Mili was still sound asleep, sleeping particularly sweetly. Adults have their complicated thoughts, while little water spirits have their own concerns, weighing equally on their hearts.

Zhu Lian gathered his voice into a thread and shared the results of last night’s discussions in the quarters with Pei Qian.

Pei Qian understood the old cook's intentions, wanting her to not overlook the contributions of Daoist Changming and Sword Immortal Mi Yu to Luopo Mountain.

Zhu Lian asked, “Do you feel better in your heart?”

Pei Qian nodded.

Zhu Lian smiled, “There’s something I need to consult you about.”

After the old cook spoke, Pei Qian replied, “I have no objections.”

Zhu Lian gazed out at the scenery beyond the cliff, “The only one who might never tire of the same mountains and waters could be our little Mili. On the road of life, some people walk a bit faster, while others can take their time. Some are tall, their hearts facing the sun, their shadows stretching long behind them, allowing the children behind to remain in the shade, escaping the scorching sun and the wind and rain. Thus, the regret of a person who must grow up would not be so hard for you and me to let go of.”

Pei Qian gently rubbed Little Mili’s head, “I understand.”

After a moment of silence, Pei Qian turned her head and, with a flushed face, said, “Regarding the matter at the Sword Worship Platform, I sincerely apologize to you.”

Zhu Lian squinted his eyes, his fists lightly resting on his knees, his expression gentle, “You don’t need to be so formal. You underestimated the old cook’s magnanimity, didn’t you?”

Pei Qian followed the old cook's gaze into the distance, “Whether the old cook minds or whether I have such an intention, and whether I am willing to apologize in person, these are two different matters.”

Zhu Lian smiled, “Young master teaches martial arts well, but teaches principles even better.”

Pei Qian smiled knowingly, “This trip away has taken quite a distance, but the old cook knows how to speak the best.”

Zhu Lian grinned, “He’s been tough since childhood, never wavering under the wind.”

Pei Qian chuckled.

Suddenly, Pei Qian asked, “Should I go take a sneak peek at that fox kingdom before descending the mountain?”

Zhu Lian shook his head, “There are certainly some pieces placed by the Xu family from Qingfeng City hidden inside. Some have already been captured, or their trusted individuals are secretly keeping watch. As for the rest, this fox kingdom’s master is unaware, so placing the kingdom in a lotus root blessed land is the best strategy; it won’t stir up any trouble. You don’t need to worry too much; the reasoning is quite simple. The Xu family would never expect the fox kingdom to relocate elsewhere. Thus, the most important pieces within the fox kingdom are those that have a stronger advantage in power, mainly used to constrain the fox kingdom’s master at the Nascent Soul level. To put it bluntly, if Chen Lingjun and Hong went to stay in the fox kingdom, it would eliminate any unexpected circumstances. As for any ulterior motives, as long as those pieces dare to move, I can trace them back one by one, not fearing how they will compete against us. Once the new fox kingdom is firmly established, many originally variable people and events will naturally integrate into the prevailing current.”

Pei Qian hesitated.
Zhu Lian chuckled, "Are you saying that I’m too indecisive? That I’m not ruthless enough with Lady Pei Xiang, the ruler of the Fox Kingdom? Or do you think I’m too concerned about her feelings, fearing that she might not find favor on the Ruined Mountain and accumulate hidden dangers, leading to mishaps down the line? It's not like that at all. To truly win people over, mere strength and authority won't suffice. If it were back when we first arrived at Ruined Mountain, I would have definitely suppressed any wavering thoughts with a heavy hand. But now, Ruined Mountain has the foundation and depth to proceed gradually."

"One must harbor no ill intentions towards others, but one must always guard against them. Not only should we treat the world this way, but we must also accept that the world sees us in the same light."

"I understand this principle, of course. It’s just that I don’t particularly care. Both Zhu Lian within and outside the Lotus Flower Blessed Land are the same. However, since you care so much, the entire Ruined Mountain naturally follows suit."

"Within the bounds of rules, we should allow some flexibility, permitting the other party to have a measure of right and wrong between the lines of great principles."

"These words were originally meant for when Lady Pei Xiang brought up the matter of the Fox Kingdom's 'literary fate' with Ruined Mountain. I’m just rambling a bit of philosophy to you first; you can take it or leave it."

Pei Qian nodded, "As for letting Cao Qinglang lose the Fortune Land, I won’t hold that against you."

Zhu Lian laughed, "So if I hadn’t said this, would you have kept a record of it?"

Pei Qian replied confidently, "Those few boxes of accounts wouldn't even be looked at by my master, let alone by you, old chef."

Curious, Zhu Lian asked, "Where did you break through to the mountain peak realm? In Aiai Continent?"

At the Thunder God Temple, Pei Qian had once sent a message to Ruined Mountain via a flying sword. That had been the last letter she sent home, and at that time, she was still in the Wandering Realm.

Pei Qian shook her head, "Aside from encountering Sword Immortal Xie in the icy plains north of Aiai, and the Thunder God Temple in Mahu Prefecture that helped me send a letter, both Senior A Xiang and Sister Sui Yu were genuinely good people. Plus, my foundation in the Wandering Realm wasn’t very solid, so I didn’t think about breaking through. I actually broke through in the Jinjia Continent, because Sister Xi said it was no longer sustainable. Rather than leave it for those beasts in the wilderness, I thought it better to take it for myself and secure my gains. Otherwise, if I had the ability to break through continuously, according to Sister Xi, once I reached the End Realm as the strongest in the world, the potential for martial fortune would be beyond imagination. Ascending from the Mountain Peak Realm to the End Realm is simply incomparable. At that time, Jinjia Continent was half righteous and half wild; as long as I got the title of 'the strongest,' I could seize martial fortune from the wilderness. There's no business more profitable than that, so during that time, whether I was training alone or fighting on the battlefield, I was completely focused, just like..."

Pei Qian turned her head and glanced at the second floor of the bamboo building.

The years of training when she suffered the most were spent there.

She felt as if she had endured all the hardships in this lifetime.

After Grandpa Cui left, Pei Qian traveled alone across continents. Even in the fierce battles on the Jinjia Continent, she hadn’t felt particularly tormented.

After retracting her gaze, Pei Qian asked, "Old chef, Grandpa Cui is essentially wandering far away now, right?"

Zhu Lian sighed, "That seems to be the case."

Suddenly, a head popped out from the cliff's edge, tears glistening at the corners of its eyes. It raised its head in indignation and shouted, "You, that beautiful fairy who isn’t a charcoal black fellow, hurry up and return my respectable and lovable senior sister!"

Xiao Mi Li jolted awake, looking confused. "Pei Qian, Pei Qian, did I just hear the voice of a big white goose?"

Pei Qian laughed, "That’s not true."

The big white goose had just kicked Pei Qian off the cliff.

Cui Dongshan lay on a cloud-like mattress that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, slowly ascending. He joked, "Sister, Xiao Mi Li, old chef, do you miss me?"

Xiao Mi Li sat up straight, clasped her hands together, and murmured, "Good dreams, good dreams, I’ll take another nap."

Cui Dongshan squatted beside Pei Qian, one shoulder higher than the other, and looked back at her. "Sister, what's going on? You're taller than Little Shixiong now."

Xiao Mi Li immediately opened her eyes, ran to Cui Dongshan's side, stood next to him, and gestured to compare their heights, laughing heartily, "Oh my, big white goose, it’s really you! How pitiful, you went from the tallest to the second tallest. My ranking hasn’t dropped at all. Don’t be sad, I’ll lend you my joy!"

Cui Dongshan smiled and nodded, "Xiao Mi Li is the best."

Xiao Mi Li, feeling a sense of urgency, signaled discreetly. She knew that among Pei Qian's little accounts, hers was the least. Of course, Sister Nuan Shu had no accounts at all.

Cui Dongshan sighed, preparing to jump up, but Xiao Mi Li quickly pressed both hands on him. After a bit of struggle, he had no choice but to give up.

Zhu Lian glanced at Cui Dongshan then looked at Pei Qian.

Pei Qian looked back at Zhu Lian and then at the big white goose.

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "Cao Qinglang is just Cao Qinglang; I have no objections."

Zhu Lian stated, "So the Fortune Land is starting work today? Those who should come to observe the ceremony are all busy. Though the people aren’t here, the gifts are plentiful."

Cui Dongshan grinned, "Today is auspicious for laying the foundation, holding ceremonies, and celebrating marriages—everything is favorable. Or do you think I rushed over here for no reason?"

Zhu Lian asked, "What about the pond behind the bamboo building?"

Cui Dongshan laughed, "It’s best to confine it within the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, saving me from one of my restrictions. Who knows, there might even be a pleasant surprise in return."

Today was destined to be a momentous day for Ruined Mountain, one that would be recorded in the ancestral hall’s history.

Even though the young mountain lord wasn’t present, there was no way to delay it any further.

Wei Ban, as the Lord of the Northern Mountain, was still responsible for opening the entrance to the Fortune Land beneath the Wutong Umbrella, and one by one, they entered the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

The Mountain Peak Realm martial artist Zhu Lian, the Mountain Peak Realm Pei Qian, the Immortal Realm Cui Dongshan, and the Sea Observation Realm Qi Practitioner Cao Qinglang. 

A jade bottle-sized as vast as the heavens belonged to Mi Yu, a sword cultivator who had just entered the Jade Purity Realm.

It seemed that the long-lived law master of Ruined Mountain, who was born with the powers of the Jade Purity Realm, was now a mystery.

Wei Wenlong, a Golden Dan cultivator from the Spring Fan Hall of the Inverted Mountain, the successful Chen Lingjun, and the water-walking Hong Xia from the Four Rivers.

The little steward Chen Nuan Shu and the right protector of Ruined Mountain, Zhou Mi Li.

And also Pei Xiang, the ruler of the Fox Kingdom, who was already in the Blessed Land, sensing a hint of anomaly deliberately revealed to her from the heavenly curtain. She immediately soared on the wind from the newly established Fox Kingdom along the border of Songlai Nation, paying her respects to everyone at Ruined Mountain before choosing to stand beside Hong Xia at the edge of the gathering.

In fact, this time to elevate the rank of the Blessed Land, the old sage, autumn sower, and the Yuan Ying sword cultivator Cui Wei were all absent, just like the young mountain lord.

Some were simply not suitable to be overly involved, such as Zhang Jiazhen, Jiang Qu, and Shi Rou, the head of the auspicious shop in Qilong Alley.

Zhu Lian smiled as he handed a money pouch to Cao Qinglang.

Cao Qinglang was taken aback, then shook his head, "Let Little Shixiong or Pei Qian do it instead."

Pei Qian remained silent.

Cui Dongshan laughed, "Those with lower realms are more likable and auspicious."

Cao Qinglang had no retort.

Zhu Lian didn’t withdraw his hand, so Cao Qinglang had no choice but to take a deep breath, accept the pouch, and pull out a Gu Yu coin, looking around.

Pei Qian remarked, "A total of eighty-one Gu Yu coins; just toss them slowly."

Cui Dongshan began to form seals, and a phenomenon manifested in the world.

The Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Water Well Cave Heaven, and Cave Heaven Blessed Land were interconnected.

Then, Cui Dongshan opened his palm, blowing gently on a miniature pond that hovered just above his palm. It landed at the foot of the central mountain in the Blessed Land, suddenly expanding to the size of a lake. A graceful purple-gold lotus bloomed from within, its leaves as large as several acres, the lotus still in bud, swaying in the wind, a purple-gold bud ready to bloom.

However, among the Qi Practitioners of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, only those who had reached the Golden Dan realm could catch a blurry glimpse of this, but there were currently no Earth Immortal cultivators in the Blessed Land.

Cao Qinglang tightened a Gu Yu coin in his hand, refining it into spiritual energy, and then slowly opened his palm.

Spiritual energy spread throughout the heavens and earth.

Wei Ban smiled faintly, pulling out a small golden crab from his sleeve. The little guy had previously received a decree to transform into a river dragon, which made him frantic in the great river. Li Xisheng couldn’t help but laugh at the harmless little joke, returning the little crab from the river to his palm, and finally gifting it to Wei Shanjun of Piyun Mountain, stating it should be placed in the pond as a guardian of the purple-gold lotus.

The little crab fell into the pond, and the golden light of the decree flashed across its back. Suddenly, the little guy shed its shell and transformed into a massive palace resembling a dragon’s lair, slowly sinking to the bottom of the water.

Cui Dongshan shook his sleeves, using the magical power of the sleeve to continuously summon pearls like rain, pouring them into the rivers and streams of the Blessed Land.

These were given by Madam Qingzhong, who was actually Li Liu's "maid". In truth, they were treasures collected over thousands of years from the Xie Long Stone in the Luoshui Pit, all delivered to Cui Dongshan at once. After all, this item was not rare in the Luoshui Pit, but it was a tremendous boon for the river transport of any Blessed Land.

Initially, the plump lady felt a bit embarrassed, thinking that the pearls showing signs of "pearl yellow" were unsuitable. She wanted to select only the good-quality ones, but Cui Dongshan splattered her with spit, demanding all the pearls while also asking for a water-based treasure.

Aside from that, offerings came from the likes of the Bone Marsh’s Pima Sect, Spring Dew Garden, Cai Que Mansion, Yunjing City, the old true person Huan Yun, and the Floating Duck Sword Lake's Li Cai, as well as Liu Jinglong from the Taihui Sword Sect, Shen Lin from the Jidu Spirit Source Palace, and Li Yuan, the Marquis of Longting...

The various sects had all sent gifts to Ruined Mountain.

For instance, from Floating Duck Sword Lake, a total of eighteen large and small lakes were presented, with Li Cai offering a lake called "Mist and Sword Whisk," a small area but filled with sword energy, one of the two main refining lakes for the Earth Immortal sword cultivators of Floating Duck Sword Lake.

Similarly, Taihui Sword Sect entrusted Pima Sect with a mountain peak, which was refined into a palm-sized miniature mountain, its real size not inferior to Huimeng Mountain.

Shen Lin gifted a large area of pavilions in the South Xun Water Palace, while Li Yuan presented a river of deep, vibrant green water.

Surprisingly, this young warrior, who loved reading, wasn’t stingy at all. He had obtained a piece of fortune on the Mount of the Crown Prince of Zhongyue, which contained two golden books, brimming with dragon energy. Since the broken secret realm couldn’t be relocated, he sent the most precious golden books to Ruined Mountain.

Of course, Wei Ban, the lord of Piyun Mountain, wouldn’t neglect to show his appreciation.

And as the head of the Jiang family, who had bet on the fortune of Ruined Mountain, "Zhou Fei," had long prepared a significant gift while assisting the Blessed Land in absorbing refugees.

Additionally, the young master of the Fan family in the Old Dragon City, Fan Er, and the head of the Sun family, Sun Jiashu, sent gifts after receiving a confidential letter from Ruined Mountain.

Even the Longquan Sword Sect’s Ruan Qiong had Liu Xianyang deliver a significant gift to Ruined Mountain.

As soon as Cao Qinglang tossed out the second to last Gu Yu coin, the heavens and earth resonated.

Cao Qinglang breathed a sigh of relief, then, as a scholar in a blue robe, solemnly bowed to the heavens and the four directions.

The others also honored the heavens in the same manner, some bowing, others cupping their fists, or offering their respects.

Heavenly treasures and earthly materials surged into the world.

Opportunities for cultivation emerged one after another.

Spirits and ghostly beings, once wandering aimlessly, began to condense into true spirits, or find their true names, starting to awaken their spiritual intelligence and truly embark on the path of cultivation.

Throughout the four nations’ territories, the spiritual energy of mountains and rivers began to gather on its own, forming new feng shui treasures. Moreover,

The long-lived law master of Ruined Mountain snapped his fingers, and a golden torrential rain fell like a decree, drenching the land and nourishing the mountains and rivers for thousands of miles.

Cui Dongshan jumped up, his sleeves billowing, repeatedly chanting the word "command."

Each of the bright energies shot into the sky like swift immortal swords.

Simultaneously, the sun and moon hung in the sky, and their brightness suddenly intensified compared to before.

After gently landing, Cui Dongshan sighed.

Everything was ready, but they were just waiting for the master to return home.

Just a storm of unknown origin was needed to bring back a night wanderer for Ruined Mountain. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 855: Laughing at the Heavens, What More Can Be Said**

In the Central Plains, at Suishan.

The armored deity sitting on the steps suddenly stood up, his expression solemn as he clasped his fists in greeting to the newcomer. The person who could earn such heartfelt respect from the Suishan Great Deity was not the sneaky old scholar with his rat-like eyes and grin, but the child beside him, Bai Ye, who now wore a tiger-head hat.

In the human realm, Bai Ye was most proud, wielding a sword on Fuyiao Island, cutting down his foes one after another. If you added in the final strikes from Zhou Mi and Liu Cha, it was Bai Ye alone holding four celestial swords, challenging the eight thrones.

However, this child, dressed in white with a red hat, had refined features, but there was a hint of aloofness in his expression. Upon seeing the Suishan Great Deity, Bai Ye merely nodded lightly.

The old scholar pressed down on the tiger-head hat, saying, “What’s going on? You’re just a child; you should show more respect! Look, it’s the great Suishan Deity before you…”

Bai Ye raised his hand, lightly patting the old scholar’s hand, signaling him to stop.

The old scholar pretended to adjust the already straight tiger-head hat, saying, “It’s windy on the mountain; I’m worried you’ll catch a cold!”

Bai Ye was still spiritually weak and needed something to cover his heavenly secrets to avoid entanglement with the somewhat unsteady patriarch of Tuoyue Mountain. Thus, the old scholar sought a treasured ritual item from the Confucian Temple, and after much persuasion, he got the sage to help refine it a bit. The final form was this tiger-head hat, which Bai Ye often wore in his hometown when he was younger.

The Suishan Deity sincerely sympathized with Bai Ye and scolded the old scholar through his heart voice, “Old scholar, be serious!”

The old scholar reluctantly withdrew his hand and asked the child with a smile, “Shall we walk to the mountain peak on foot, or do we trouble the Suishan Deity for a ride?”

Bai Ye had already taken the lead, uninterested in wasting breath with the old scholar. He intended to walk to the summit of Suishan to meet the sage.

In his life, Bai Ye had visited many mountains and sought many immortals, yet for some reason, due to various twists of fate, he had passed by Suishan several times but had never been able to ascend it. Thus, he wanted to seize this opportunity to finally walk it.

The old scholar followed behind the tiger-hat-wearing Bai Ye, glancing back at the silly giant who wanted to sit down again, and teased, “What are you doing, hatching a nest of chicks under your behind? Or are you here to collect tolls from the old man as a door god? Hurry up and protect the young master! The winds on Suishan are fierce; if this tiger-head hat blows away, don’t blame me for forgetting our brotherly bond. When we get to the old man, I’ll be sure to tell on you…”

The armored deity ignored the old scholar's rambling and silently followed the two up the steps.

The cliff-carved stone tablets of Suishan, both in number and literary elegance, were unmatched throughout the realm. The greatest regret in the armored deity's heart was the absence of a tablet inscribed with Bai Ye’s own writing.

However, the child in the tiger-head hat could be considered a genuine fallen immortal.

The old scholar turned around and said, “Bai Ye’s poetry is unrivaled, isn’t that right? Does Suishan acknowledge it?”

The armored deity nodded, “Of course. Mr. Bai’s poems are as fierce as a tiger.”

In fact, at the peak of Suishan, the armored deity had specially left a blank stone cliff.

It must be known that famous mountains in the world often have many immortal teachers and literary figures inscribing their works on them. This is what is meant by “since ancient times, famous mountains await the sage.” Especially at the summit of Danyue, for millennia, there had hardly been a space large enough for a palm to remain for later generations to leave inscriptions or set up steles. This speaks volumes of the sincerity of the Suishan Deity. Furthermore, this “Central Plains Mountain God” was not like the old scholar, who would openly boast about such intentions. If Bai Ye did not come to ascend the mountain, he would simply let it be. If Bai Ye did come, he would be the first to bring ink and paper to block Bai Ye’s door.

The old scholar turned around and stomped his foot, exclaiming, “How can it be that such a grand Suishan has not a single word of Bai Ye’s poetry? What kind of Suishan Deity are you?”

The armored deity replied, “I did not wish to disturb Mr. Bai while he was in seclusion reading.”

The old scholar spat, “You simply lack sincerity! It’s no wonder you’re not close to Bai Ye. How many people in the world can call Bai Ye brother, or even have a connection through their own disciples, perhaps even looking up to him half a generation? But what about our relationship? Why haven’t you ever asked me for a favor? Whether you ask or not is your business; agreeing or refusing is mine! Shouldn’t we discuss the order of things?”

The armored deity was infuriated, replying through thought, “Are you saying I should leave you here at the mountain foot to ramble on?”

The child in the tiger-head hat began to use his innate divine abilities to stoke the old scholar’s flames, ignoring him while happily ascending, enjoying the scenery of Suishan.

The old scholar’s expression changed immediately, and he turned to the giant, saying amiably, “Today’s scholars, so shameless, say Bai Ye’s flaws are only in his seven-character regulated verse, lacking rigor and full of imperfections, which is why few have survived. What nonsense! ‘The sturdy waist of a strong woman flutters among the flowers,’ slapping a name on Bai Ye’s head that is far less charming than this tiger-head hat, don’t you think?”

The armored deity looked puzzled, wondering if the old scholar was being unusually kind-hearted, suggesting that Bai Ye should leave behind a seven-character regulated verse to be inscribed on Suishan.

The old scholar gave a knowing glance to the silly giant, and seeing that the Suishan Deity seemed to be unaware, he raised a hand and gently rubbed his fingers together.

The armored deity was genuinely moved. As long as the old scholar had Bai Ye leave behind a seven-character regulated verse, everything was negotiable. Borrowing a mountain peak for the old scholar would be no problem at all. In exchange for two or three hundred years of merit, he could obtain a poem from Bai Ye.

The old scholar paused, stroked his beard, and coughed a few times, slowly saying, “Listen closely… Poetry and verse have strict rules; it would be strange if Bai Ye were bound by them…”

Unexpectedly, the child in the tiger-head hat, who had climbed several dozen steps ahead, said, “Seven-character regulated verse is indeed not my strong suit. If the Suishan Deity were to hear a certain seven-character poem, it would definitely be a work under the old scholar's name.”

The old scholar sighed, hurried to catch up with the tiger-hat child, and just as he reached out to adjust the hat, Bai Ye, without turning his head, swatted his hand away.

The Suishan Deity escorted the two to the peak, clasping fists in greeting to the elderly sage who sat reading, then returned to the foot of the mountain.

Although Bai Ye was no longer that fourteenth-level practitioner, his physical strength still surpassed that of ordinary mortals and pilgrims, and it took him merely half an hour to climb the mountain.

The elderly sage turned to the child in the tiger-head hat and smiled, “I’m a bit busy, so I won’t stand.”

The child bowed to the sage.

The old scholar was delighted, already short of stature, he bent down even more.

At the summit of Suishan, the scenery was magnificent, the four skies opened at midnight, and the stars sparkled brilliantly. 

The old scholar sighed, “Heaven's will is always difficult to inquire; one must ask. The breath of the world resounds like a drum, how could one dare not listen?”

Suddenly, the sky seemed to ripple as if a giant rock had fallen into a lake, waves surging endlessly. This was the handiwork of the gray-clad old man above the Jiao Dragon Ditch, attempting to draw the remnants of ancient deities from beyond the heavens into the realm of Haoran.

Meanwhile, the sage was responsible for mending the sky, preventing the rites from becoming too burdensome. As for the various magical spells and abilities of the patriarch of Tuoyue Mountain that had fallen into the human realm, they would also be nullified one by one by the sage.

A Taibai sword sheath suddenly appeared beside the child in the tiger-head hat, precisely the talisman returning to Suishan.

Bai Ye gently grasped it, hesitating to speak.

The elderly sage nodded and said, “Go. Whether in the Haoran realm or the Qingming realm, the human world is still the human world, and Bai Ye is still Bai Ye.”

Bai Ye bowed again and took his leave from the sage, setting off for a distant journey.

He owed Daoist Sun too much and planned to venture to the Daxuandu Temple.

At that time, Bai Ye was on Fuyiao Island, already resigned to his fate. The Taibai sword had split into four, each sent away. Now that he had the chance to resume his cultivation, Bai Ye was not worried about owing this favor.

Once he reached the Daxuandu Temple, a hundred years would be more than enough time.

The old scholar squatted down, hands hidden in his sleeves, whispering, “In this world of chaos, bearing a candle in the night, I walk and suddenly see, the long sky and bright autumn moon.”

The child in the tiger-head hat held the sword sheath in one hand and pressed down on the old scholar’s head with the other, saying, “You’re still young; try to complain less in the future.”

In fact, aside from the sage referring to the Literary Sage as “scholar,” other practitioners at the summit of the mountain often habitually called the Literary Sage “old scholar.” After all, there are countless scholars in the human realm, and someone who has held this title for so many years truly deserves the title of “old.” But in reality, the old scholar was much younger than Chen Chunan and Bai Ye. Compared to the Suishan Deity, he was even more so. However, for some reason, the old scholar seemed truly old, both in appearance and demeanor. He did not possess the elegant demeanor of the refined Chen Chunan, nor the celestial aura of Bai Ye. The old scholar was short and thin, with wrinkles on his face like ravines, his hair white as snow. In the past, when he accompanied rituals at the Confucian Temple in the Central Plains, the major academies and universities would hang his portrait, requesting the skilled painter with whom he had a close relationship to depict him younger and more handsome, lamenting when it didn’t turn out quite right, “Where did my scholarly air go? Be realistic, be realistic! You should be more artistic, come on… If you can’t do it, I’ll do it myself…”

The old scholar stood up and said, “A traveler returns home; it’s only natural, no matter how good a foreign land may be, one must remember to return home.”

Bai Ye nodded, “I will.”

The Taibai sword sheath shimmered and disappeared into one of his innate orifices.

The old scholar worriedly said, “I’ve heard the vegetarian food at Daxuandu Temple isn’t very good.”

From afar, the elderly sage responded, “I’ve heard that too; it’s quite ordinary.”

The old scholar said to Bai Ye, “Listen, listen! Am I just talking nonsense? The old man wouldn’t make things up; it really isn’t good!”

In the past, the Sub-sage traveled to the Qingming realm for many years, which was a mutual exchange between the Central Plains Confucian Temple and Bai Yujing.

Bai Ye adjusted his bright red tiger-head hat and gazed up at the sky, then returned his gaze to his homeland, where the plum blossoms bloomed year after year.

---

In the Qingming realm, outside the gates of Daxuandu Temple, a young Daoist wearing a lotus crown leaned casually against the doorframe, not in a hurry to discuss serious matters with Daoist Sun. Instead, he smiled and chatted with a female Daoist sister. He spoke about how his senior brother borrowed a sword from Bai Ye, and how he had personally witnessed the heavenly sword traveling thousands of miles at Bai Yujing. “Sister Chunhui, you’re too far away to see it clearly; you can only catch a glimpse of the mystical aura trailing the sword. It’s a small regret.”

The female Daoist, carrying a sword on her back, smiled and replied, “Sect Leader Lu, you can chat with me all you want, but you still can’t enter the gates. The Patriarch has spoken: a dog wagging its tail on the way can enter, but you, Lu Chen, may not.”

Lu Chen laughed heartily, “Daoist Sun still holds me in high regard! It doesn’t matter if I can’t get in; half of my intention in visiting this time is to see Sister Chunhui. Just seeing you is worth the trip.”

The Daoist sister, known as Chunhui, appeared somewhat helpless, “Sect Leader Lu, I truly won’t go to that Ziqi Tower to cultivate, to become the leader of the Jiang family’s Spring Festival. It’s just not for me.”

Lu Chen looked pitiful, “If you don’t want to be the Spring Festival leader, going to Qingcui City is fine too. Have you heard about Jiang Yunsheng, who just returned home? He’s a lively and lovely child with a youthful face, and he was chosen by my senior brother as the Jade Carver when he traveled far. If you agree, I’ll arrange a joyful event for Qingcui City tomorrow! The betrothal gifts will be substantial; the Jiang family from Bai Yujing and Qingcui City will each contribute a large portion, and Daxuandu Temple won’t even need to provide a dowry…”

The female Daoist blushed with annoyance, “Sect Leader Lu, please be careful with your words!”

Lu Chen blinked, tentatively asking, “What if I let Jiang Yunsheng acknowledge you as his godmother? You wouldn’t even need to betray your master to go to that Qingcui City; it’s an easy way to get a son. Imagine how good it would sound when it spreads; it would enhance the prestige of the Daxuandu Temple’s sword immortal lineage.”

The young female Daoist with the appearance of a jade-like figure narrowed her phoenix eyes, “Sect Leader Lu!”

Lu Chen sighed, “Alright, alright, I’m truly not cut out to be a matchmaker. But to be honest, during my travels in Lihuzhou, I diligently studied palmistry for many years, analyzing marriage and predicting fortune. I can read it quite accurately. Sister Chunhui, how about I take a look for you?”

An old, slender Daoist suddenly appeared at the gate, smiling, “Sect Leader Lu, have you been possessed by some outer celestial demon? You're quite shameless today. In the past, your Daoist skills were profound, flowing like clouds and waters. Today, why are you acting like a matchmaker? Chunhui, why not just accept a ready-made one right here? Why bother with a guest?”

The old Daoist, Sun Daoist, had a nostalgic appearance, carrying a peach wood sword and wearing a robe made of ordinary silk with twelve hidden patterns, corresponding to the twelve months of the year.

If any of his former peers had seen him, they would definitely praise the old Daoist for his celestial demeanor and true Daoist essence.

Lu Chen smiled brightly, “Where am I? You’re much more relaxed and comfortable, old dog! Staying in the nest guarding the night, you only move your mouth, not your body. Once you move, there’s a different kind of charm—like an old turtle flipping over, stirring up waves.”

Sun Daoist smiled, “Come on, let’s go in and chat.”

Lu Chen nodded vigorously, stepping over the threshold but not touching the ground.

Sun Daoist maintained a kind expression, standing aside.

However, the young female Daoist with the sword on her back was already sweating on her forehead. 

It wasn’t that she was timid, but once Lu Chen’s foot touched the ground inside the gate, the Patriarch would start receiving guests, and it would be no trifling matter. The mountain-protecting formation, temple prohibitions, and all her many senior brothers, even those she had to call uncle or grand-uncle, would instantly scatter to block the way… The practitioners at Daxuandu Temple loved nothing more than to “single out” one person.

Lu Chen jumped, switching feet to cross the threshold, still suspended in mid-air, “Hey, I won’t be going in.”

The young female Daoist did not find it amusing, remaining on guard. Although she worried about being caught in a brawl between two of the world’s top deities, her duty required her to stand firm. The Daxuandu Temple had a longstanding tradition of not losing face, so she could only grit her teeth and stand her ground. She hid her hands in her sleeves, silently forming a protective gesture. While seeking her own safety, she also hoped to find an opportunity to strike a few blows against Bai Yujing’s San Zhangjiao or land a solid attack with her talisman.

Sun Daoist turned and walked towards the temple steps, and Lu Chen retracted his foot, bidding farewell to Sister Chunhui, swaggering beside Sun Daoist, saying, “The Taibai sword is gone just like that; are you heartbroken? I have some salt here; old brother Sun, just take it for cooking. It’ll save the temple’s vegetarian dishes from being so bland.”

As Sun Daoist stepped off the last step, once his foot touched the ground, both he and Lu Chen appeared several thousand miles away.

Sun Daoist liked peace and quiet. Outside the realm of Daxuandu Temple, he had established a summer retreat. It wasn’t particularly auspicious in terms of feng shui, nor were there any prohibitions or rituals, the only highlight being an ancient pine tree, lush and vibrant.

Under the pine, a white-clad boy was brewing tea, while a purple-bearded, high-crowned armored deity stood nearby.

Among the branches of the ancient pine hung a lovely “Baiyu Plate,” like a piece of literary offering embedded in the green shade of the ancient pine.

Aside from that, on either side of the ground beneath the ancient pine, there were two words engraved by Sun Daoist and his junior brother with the Taibai sword in years gone by: Northern Feng and Southern Dou.

There was a stone table under the pine, and once the old Daoist Sun sat down, Lu Chen removed his boots, crossed his legs, and casually placed his lotus crown on the table.

Lu Chen got straight to the point, “I came here on the Master’s orders. Otherwise, I wouldn’t willingly come here for a scolding.”

Sun Daoist frowned slightly.

Aside from the fifth realm of the cosmos that was initially opened, the other four realms were orderly and had strict Daoist principles. Regardless of whether it was the Qingming realm or the Haoran realm, in each realm, there was a major rule regarding conflicts among practitioners: they must delineate the four realms. For example, in the Qingming realm, no matter how bold someone was, they wouldn’t think of challenging the Dao Ancestor—this was no longer about whether one’s heart was steadfast or daring; it was simply impossible.
The Ancestor of the Dao had little desire to frequently visit the White Jade Capital (Baiyu Jing). Instead, he allowed his three disciples to take turns managing it. Even Sun Daolong, despite his disdain for Dao Lao Er (Dao Old Two) Yu Dou, still held a degree of respect for the Dao Ancestor.

Lu Chen chuckled, “Bai is also someone who doesn’t like to owe favors. So unless something unexpected happens, he will most likely come to the Grand Xuan Dao Temple (Da Xuan Du Guan) to repay his debts. The Confucian Temple won’t obstruct him either. I came to see you today just to say hello. The relationship between Baiyu Capital and the Grand Xuan Dao Temple will remain as it has always been. Bai will focus on his cultivation here. Regardless of whether he enters the ancestral hall of the Grand Xuan Dao Temple, he will still be regarded as Bai by the White Jade Capital. So, Master Sun, you need not worry about this matter at all.”

Sun Daolong nodded in acknowledgment.

Propping his chin on one hand and leaning against the stone table, Lu Chen continued, “I’ve heard that Brother Sun has taken in some excellent disciples—real gems among people. Why haven’t you let me take a look and satisfy my curiosity?”

Sun Daolong inquired, “How did Bai die, and how did he come back to life?”

Lu Chen sighed, waving his hand lightly as if fanning himself, “The situation regarding Zhou Mi’s alignment with the Dao is rather peculiar. The Dao has its worries, you see. This fellow has thrown the heavenly mechanisms in the world of Haoran (Hao Ran) into absolute chaos. Half of the embroidered tigers were severed right at a key juncture for me, and I cannot trust what my disciples He Xiaoliang and Cao Rong saw. It might be better not to count on it and just leave it to fate. After all, it’s not my personal affair for the time being. If the sky were to fall, wouldn’t there be the invincible master Yu Dou to hold it up?”

Sun Daolong scoffed, “Dao Old Two is willing to lend a sword to Bai, which nearly made me pop my eyes out in surprise.”

Lu Chen replied lazily, “Master Yu still has a heroic spirit. Brother Sun, as a half-family member, don’t speak in anger; it’s easy to hurt feelings.”

At that moment, both Sun Daolong and Lu Chen looked up at the sky almost simultaneously.

Sun Daolong stood up and laughed heartily, performing a gesture of respect, and the white jade plate nestled among the ancient pine branches sparkled, illuminating the heavens.

Lu Chen hurriedly put on his boots. It was time to leave—quickly and decisively.

Once Lu Chen departed, the light dimmed. In front of Sun Daolong stood a child and an elderly figure. Sun Daolong widened his eyes in disbelief and asked, “Bai?”

The child, wearing a tiger hat, nodded and took out a sword sheath, handing it to the old Daoist with an apologetic expression, “The Taibai Immortal Sword has been destroyed…”

The old Daoist waved his hand dismissively, muttering, “To hell with it! Why waste words over such trivial matters?” He quickly walked over to the child, squatting down, and teased, “Whose little one is this? So exquisitely carved, those young ladies in the Grand Xuan Dao Temple will surely forget to cultivate and just come running to pinch your cheeks every day. As the ancestor, I can’t say too much…”

Bai remained expressionless, merely tugging at the strings of his tiger hat.

At this moment, the child was clearly not in a good mood.

During their journey, the old scholar had emphasized that the Sage Ancestor had personally advised him not to rush into removing the hat until he reached the Fifth Realm. Bai could hardly imagine how it felt to wear the tiger hat before reaching the Jade Purity Realm.

Beside him, the old scholar pinched a blue material travel talisman between his fingers, gradually making it disappear. Once the talisman burned out completely, he would return to the world of Haoran.

Sun Daolong stood up and performed a respectful gesture, laughing, “Old Scholar, you’re truly unparalleled.”

The old scholar returned the gesture with a smile, praising, “Daoist, Daoist.”

Both parties exchanged knowing smiles, realizing that seeing one another in person was far better than merely hearing about each other.

Then the old scholar pinched the talisman with one hand and pointed upward with the other, rising on his toes to bellow, “Dao Old Two, so invincible, huh? If you want to argue, let’s do it. If you’re feeling bold, just come and cleave me with that immortal sword! Come on, come on, remember to bring that sword; otherwise, don’t bother coming. If you do come, it won’t be enough to see. The heroic and righteous Daoist Sun here won’t take sides; our grudges will be settled with just that sword…”

At the highest point of the White Jade Capital, Dao Old Two squinted his eyes, calculating in his sleeve while glancing at the sky.

Bai suddenly spoke, “The Immortal Sword Dao Canon will only return to the Qingming Realm before your talismans disappear.”

Though he had lost his realm, his vision remained sharp.

The old scholar chuckled, his expression calm, yet his hand holding the talisman drooped, gently swaying. Moments later, he simply raised his hand and blew gently.

After all, they were on the same side. What was the point of being overly formal?

The old scholar, though poor, was never one to skimp on formality.

Sun Daolong laughed, “The Scholar of Literature needn’t rush back. If Dao Old Two really dares to come here, I will dare to go to the White Jade Capital.”

The old scholar clutched the talisman tightly, rubbing his hands together as he laughed, “No, no, no! We can’t let Bai, who has just arrived, be dragged into this mess.”

Sun Daolong suddenly frowned, “Old Scholar, are you going to the Fifth Realm?”

The old scholar shook his head, “Not for the time being.”

Sun Daolong urged, “You should go.”

The old scholar immediately understood, spreading his hands. Sun Daolong brought his fingers together, a particle of spiritual light gathering at his fingertips before gently pressing it onto the travel talisman personally drawn by the Sage Ancestor.

The old scholar turned to look at the child in the tiger hat.

He should feel at ease, yet he couldn’t help but worry.

After all, Bai was just a child who needed to seek the Dao once again, no longer the most accomplished person in the world.

Bai said, “You take care of yourself first. I’ll find you for a drink later.”

The old scholar nodded, suddenly feeling sentimental. He softly asked, “The Bai who laughed heartily as he left, I have always been curious about how he truly was.”

The old scholar merely asked casually, and it didn’t matter whether Bai had an answer.

The child in the tiger hat thought for a moment, crossing his arms and standing on his toes, tilting his head back. He opened his mouth and closed it again, seemingly reciting something quickly. He said three words almost without any change in tone, “Ha, ha, ha.”

It was rather dismissive.

Even Sun Daolong, accustomed to all kinds of storms, felt he had gained some new insight today.

The old scholar laughed until he could hardly close his mouth, his entire face wrinkled up. The elderly man, who loved to chatter, said nothing more. As the talisman vanished, he disappeared in a flash. The gateway to the heavens opened, and he returned to the world of Haoran.

————

On the Treasure Bottle Continent, Cui Zhan’s avatar held up a replica of the White Jade Capital. Today, Cui Zhan, in his true form, made an exception and didn’t hold a lecture but instead entertained two old acquaintances.

Neither of the two old friends had come here in their true forms, as methods of crossing continents were numerous, and the more mysterious the technique, the more it cost. However, there was no need for Cui Zhan to worry about this.

When Cui Zhan descended to the mortal realm and walked along the banks of a great river, a plump wealthy man and a plainly dressed middle-aged man flanked him, strolling by the water.

One was Liu Jubao, the God of Wealth from the White Snow Continent (Aiai Zhou); the other was Yu Panshui, the Supreme Emperor from the Central Land’s Hidden Dynasty—neither of whom were known for being stingy with heavenly money.

In a family study, the young man Lin Junbi was giving Yu Panshui a headache, but now he was fawning over Cui Zhan, “Brother Cui, your grand gesture truly is earth-shattering! The Haoran’s Three Great Matters are not enough; it must include this as well.”

Liu Jubao, however, lacked the shamelessness of Yu Panshui; gazing at the flowing river, he couldn’t hide his admiration.

What Liu Jubao saw was not just the river’s rolling waters but a continuous stream of heavenly money. If one had sufficient ability, it was just like opening a large sack of money at the mouth of the river flowing into the sea.

Cui Zhan asked with a smile, “Old Yu, how is your chess skill these days?”

Yu Panshui complained, “You know I’m strong; why ask?”

Yu Panshui’s chess skills were high enough that, according to Cui Zhan’s words from years ago, the time Yu spent cleaning up the chess pieces was longer than the time spent on the game itself.

His style was domineering, decisive in attacks, and unyielding, leading to quick losses. Cui Zhan rarely wanted to waste time with such a poor player, but Yu Panshui was the exception. Of course, the so-called chess game often extended beyond the board, and both sides were well aware and enjoyed it.

After the defeat of the Wen Sheng lineage, Cui Zhan had rebelled against his teacher and destroyed his ancestral line, becoming a pariah that everyone scorned. However, during a time that seemed prosperous for the Great Cheng Dynasty, Cui Zhan and Yu Panshui had a discussion at the Yingbai Pavilion, where they unraveled the looming decline masked by the beautiful tapestry of flowers. It was after that chess game that Yu, slightly indecisive, resolved to change dynasties.

One thing Cui Zhan held dear was that, unlike ordinary scholars of the world who were aware of various flaws yet remained helpless, Cui Zhan would always keep his thoughts to himself and never feign profundity. In simple terms, Cui Zhan only did what was within his capabilities, was willing to act, and able to do so. Therefore, when Cui Zhan left the Yu family, aside from the obvious outcome of the chess match, he also left behind a booklet on the changing of dynasties, merely aiming to assist Yu in sorting out his strategies and interconnections.

At that time, as Yu sent him off at the steps of the pavilion, he only asked, “What does the embroidered tiger seek?”

Cui Zhan replied, “In the future, when I borrow money from the Yu family, you, Yu Panshui, mustn’t be vague about it. Give as much as you can. It’s hard to say whether we’ll profit a lot or a little, but we will never lose money.”

Yu Panshui, known for being a poor chess player, was, however, quite sharp in political and strategic matters. By thirty, he had already become the national master of the Great Cheng Dynasty, having propped up several puppet emperors and earned the title of Dragon Slayer.

Regarding the “Fat Yu,” opinions were mixed throughout the mountains of Haoran, with many palace secrets and scandals circulating among the peaks.

Cui Zhan turned to Liu Jubao and asked, “Are you still unwilling to place a hefty bet?”

Liu Jubao replied, “Earning money doesn’t rely on gambling; it’s the first family rule of the Liu clan. The Liu clan has lent money to the Great Li on two occasions, and it was no small amount.”

“Gu Yu money. A hundred thousand, on two occasions, each one hundred,” he stated.

Cui Zhan laughed, “Gambling? Liu Brother, do you look down on the defensive stance of my Treasure Bottle Continent, or do you disdain the offensive nature of the Wild Lands?”

Liu Jubao smiled but said nothing.

When dealing with this embroidered tiger, never argue; it’s utterly pointless.

As for Liu Jubao, the God of Wealth from the White Snow Continent, he held a prosperous land of Han Su and controlled the source of all heavenly money in the world. The Confucian Temple in the Central Land recognized a ten percent profit for the Liu family.

There were indeed black and white contracts in place. The parties involved were the Sage of Rites and Liu Jubao.

Moreover, the reserves of that heavenly money mine were still astonishing. Masters of arts and Yin-Yang experts had once jointly assessed and calculated its potential for several years, ultimately arriving at an answer that satisfied Liu Jubao.

In other words, the Liu family from the White Snow Continent not only had wealth now but would continue to have it in the future, earning them the reputation of being “sitting on a mountain that never runs dry.”

Even the old merchant ancestor, Mr. Fan, claimed that Liu Jubao was indeed wealthy.

Among the offerings of the Liu family, there was a martial artist from the Thunder God Temple in the White Snow Continent named Pei Axiang. As the foremost martial artist of a continent, his ranking in offerings was only third. The total number of arts masters amounted to three ancestral masters, two of whom were offerings from the Liu family.

Cui Zhan asked, “Xie Songhua still doesn’t want to be named as a guest elder of the Liu family?”

Liu Jubao candidly acknowledged this, nodding with a smile, “Wealth, in the end, cannot win everyone’s hearts. That’s why I genuinely admire that female sword immortal.”

One of the family’s ancestors was currently working hard to persuade the female sword immortal, Xie Songhua, to become a guest elder of the family, as expecting her to take up an offering position was out of the question. Xie Songhua had never held any affection for her homeland, the White Snow Continent, and held an even worse impression of the wealthy Liu family.

So, as long as Xie Songhua gave a nod, she wouldn’t need to set foot in the Liu residence, nor would she let the elder do anything. During ancestral hall discussions, Xie could skip attendance, but as long as she conveyed her thoughts, it would still be effective. Additionally, Xie Songhua’s two direct disciples, Ju Xing and Zhao Mu, were nearing the Fifth Realm, and for matters regarding sword nurturing and refining, the Liu family would cover all their needs for heavenly materials, treasures, and heavenly money.

Yet, even so, Xie Songhua remained unwilling to agree. Throughout the entire process, she only spoke one sentence to the Liu family ancestor, “If it weren’t for the face of the Monkey House at the Upside-Down Mountain, you wouldn’t be asking about a sword.”

The Liu family from the White Snow Continent certainly didn’t lack for a sword immortal to stand guard; it was merely the family head who had instructed that the family elder must ensure this matter succeeded and treat the sword immortal with great respect. Otherwise, when he returned to the ancestral hall, Liu Jubao wouldn’t speak kindly.

Cui Zhan laughed, “Business is business; if Liu Brother doesn’t want to bet big, that’s fine. The previous loans, both principal and interest, amounted to a single piece of heavenly money from the Liu family. Beyond that, I can let Xie Songhua serve as an offering for the Liu family, as a token of gratitude for Liu Brother’s willingness to lend money.”

Moreover, Liu Jubao was a man who never forgot his roots. Just for the sake of the martial arts and sword spirit of the White Snow Continent, he had secretly spent countless resources, which Cui Zhan had noted.

In the world, the wealthy come and go; regardless of new or old faces, someone always occupies the position of wealth. Who rightfully deserves wealth is a profound question.

In the affairs of the world, it all comes back to interpersonal dealings.

Liu Jubao remarked, “Next, the Wild Lands will be consolidating the front lines. Even if Zhou Mi sends most of the top combat forces to the Southern Posa Continent, the Treasure Bottle Continent will still be quite awkward.”

Cui Zhan sneered, “Gathering Mosquitoes?”

Liu Jubao was left speechless.

Beside him, the portly Yu still felt his eyelids twitch and quickly patted his chest to calm himself.

After over a hundred years of diligent governance, the national treasury of the Great Li had accumulated a considerable foundation. Additionally, the personal wealth of the Song Emperor was significant, making it relatively substantial compared to an ordinary Central Land dynasty. However, before the iron cavalry of the Great Li marched south, merely constructing that replica of the White Jade Capital and supporting the cavalry’s southern advance would already stretch their resources thin. Furthermore, the grand assembly of sword boats hovering in the air, the migration of border troops across the mountains as if walking on flat land, and the creation of “armor for both man and horse” talismans for the Great Li’s cavalry—all of these financial burdens, along with countless other costly items from the mountains, would soon drain the Great Li’s coffers. What was to be done?

Borrow money.

The embroidered tiger, Cui Zhan, borrowed from merchant Mr. Fan, from Yu Panshui, from Liu Jubao of the White Snow Continent, from Mo family masters, and secretly from various schools and families.

Part of the money would flow through the southern advance of the Great Li’s iron cavalry, integrating the vast profits brought by the mountains and rivers of a continent to repay part of the debts.
In addition to that, Cui Zhan had also "borrowed" a significant amount, of course, from the devastated Tongye Continent, where the Mountain Dynasty was nearly obliterated, along with its sects!

Liu Jubao shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that; it doesn’t feel right.”

Cui Zhan turned and laughed, “Are you really going to stop Xie Songhua from taking the Liu family’s offerings? If you turn your back on people, do you think you can play games with a temperamental swordswoman?”

Liu Jubao sighed in resignation, “You’re ruthless.”

Yu Panshui couldn’t help but gloat, bursting into laughter, “Seeing Liu Caishen get stuck is truly refreshing! Good, good, good! Just based on this move from Xiu Hu, I can retrieve half of the treasury from the Xuanmi Kingdom!”

Cui Zhan smiled and replied, “There’s no need to thank me. If you want to show gratitude, thank Liu Caishen for giving the Yu family this opportunity to make money.”

Yu Panshui clicked his tongue, “In this world, there’s truly no one who can make borrowing money feel so refreshing and elegant, except for Xiu Hu!”

Suddenly, Liu Jubao stopped in his tracks and said, “I can only confirm one thing: did you, Cui Zhan, leave yourself a way out? I’m placing my bets right now!”

Yu Panshui followed suit and halted, perking up his ears. This was precisely what he, as the head of the Yu family, wanted to know most. Once he confirmed it, let alone the remaining half of the treasury from the Xuanmi Dynasty, Yu Panshui could turn the sixteen vassal states upside down, all to accompany Xiu Hu and Liu Caishen in pulling off a grand feat. Who dares to rebel? Do they think our Xuanmi Dynasty doesn’t have enough territory?

But Cui Zhan shook his head, “Human hearts are twofold. I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you.”

The implication was clear: there was no escape route, but a heart at peace—that was all there was to it.

Cui Zhan calculated many things, from human affairs to national fortunes, but he was definitely not someone who would rely solely on cunning and lowly tricks.

Liu Jubao rubbed his cheeks vigorously and then, for the first time, let out a few curses before fixing his gaze on Xiu Hu. “Once the Liu family makes a big bet, can we actually make money from the mountains and rivers of Tongye Continent? The key is whether the money will burn our hands. You should be able to say something about that?!”

Yu Panshui muttered under his breath, “You deaf fool, Xiu Hu has always said he can make money. He only finds joy in being scolded. If Brother Cui was truly a hero focused on making money, let alone losing a 'North' character from the Aiai Continent, you, Liu Jubao, would lose your title as Caishen.”

Cui Zhan looked at Liu Jubao and smiled, “Helping friends make money is one of life’s greatest pleasures.”

Liu Jubao’s expression was complex as he raised a hand. Cui Zhan hesitated for a moment before lightly clapping it.

Liu Jubao withdrew his magical powers, his figure dissipating, leaving behind a remark, “That’s a bit too much money.”

However, Yu Panshui didn’t leave; he accompanied Cui Zhan for a while longer. It wasn’t until they could see the distant Grand Duxi Temple that Yu Panshui finally stopped, softly saying, “No matter what others think, I can’t bear to lose a Xiu Hu from this world.”

Cui Zhan smiled, “That’s good to hear.”

Yu Panshui sighed and vanished in a flash.

Cui Zhan sat by the banks of the Grand Duxi River, glancing at the distant Qidu Gate before retracting his gaze, a smile on his face. The aged scholar, with graying temples, murmured softly, “What more is there to say?”

 **Chapter 856: Questioning the Sword in High Places**

As that brilliant, seven-colored sword light broke free from Ascension City and pierced through the heavens, leaving this world behind, a moment of silence fell over the city, only to erupt into a flurry of activity. Lanterns burst to life, and sword cultivators hurriedly vacated their homes, gazing upward in astonishment. Could it be that Ning Yao had achieved a breakthrough and ascended?!

At the Chen family residence on Taixiang Street, the former sword immortal Chen Xi, now known as Chen Zhi, appeared as a youthful figure. He had been strolling through the corridor, and was among the first to notice the strange phenomenon. Currently, Chen Zhi concealed his true identity and realm, yet a personal maid remained closely at his side, serving as a mere distraction. In truth, with each passing year in Ascension City, Chen Zhi moved closer to reclaiming his past identity as the engraved sword immortal Chen Xi. Thus, the sword cultivator maid who served as his shadow moved further from death and closer to the heights of the sword path.

Sighing, Chen Zhi felt that Ning Yao’s summoning of her immortal sword was premature and fraught with peril. If she had waited until the sword was fully refined, breaking through the immortal realm to enter the ascendant state would have been far more prudent. Although he didn’t understand Ning Yao’s motivations, he trusted that she had her reasons for taking such risks. He certainly wouldn’t impose his opinions on her. As a former head of the Chen family and the most important inheritor of the Chen Qingdu lineage, he refused to be so small-minded. Moreover, with his current realm insufficient, seeking out Ning Yao for a confrontation would be futile.

Furrowing his brow, Chen Zhi noted that not only he and his maid but nearly all the sword cultivators disturbed by the phenomenon had spotted Ning Yao, clad in a white robe, carrying her sword and departing Ascension City, seemingly headed for distant lands.

The maid, whose appearance was rather plain, couldn’t help but whisper, “A beauty like jade and a sword like a rainbow—both the person and the sword are exquisite.”

In the past, top families on Taixiang Street and Yuhu Street often nurtured talented young women as sword attendants, treating them well, with future marriages expected to occur within their own ranks.

This maid, named Yan Quan, bore the Chen surname by grace of her master.

Yan Quan had long admired Ning Yao, considering her to be the pinnacle of beauty among women in the world.

Ning Yao’s sudden journey, without any warning, saw her still donned in her golden robe, her feet on a long sword. The sword sheathed in her sword box was called “Sword Immortal.”

Chen Zhi had once intended to match her with Chen Sanqiu as a couple, but Chen Sanqiu remained entranced by someone else, leading Chen Zhi to abandon that thought.

With a grave expression, Chen Zhi mused, “Ning Yao has deliberately distanced herself from Ascension City to lure those ancient beings into an ambush against her. She intends to sever her karmic ties, ensuring that the many paths arising from her do not settle upon Ascension City.”

He felt powerless to stop Ning Yao's departure from the city, nor could he offer any assistance.

Chen Zhi self-deprecatingly remarked, “With my insufficient realm, do I really need to drink my sorrows away?”

In recent years, Chen Zhi had intentionally slowed his progression through the realms, which was why he had only recently entered the Nascent Soul stage. Had he ascended to the upper five realms too soon, it would have been challenging to conceal his identity. He preferred to live in these laid-back days for a few more years, hoping to wait until this façade reached the age of maturity before reemerging. It would also allow him to observe the growth of younger talents like Qi Shou and Gao Ye. For the next century, Chen Zhi had no intention of reclaiming the identity of “Chen Xi.”

Yan Quan was curious about the sword light; could it be the legendary life-bound sword of Ning Yao, said to be rarely summoned, called “Slaying Immortals”?

Chen Zhi was also intrigued about the Confucian sage presiding over the heavens—whether he could stop the immortal sword “Tian Zhen” or if he even contemplated interference, allowing events to unfold as they would.

This was crucial. Observing the subtleties revealed much about the true stance of the Confucian Temple towards Ascension City, whether they had agreed to impose no restrictions on sword cultivators.

Was the sage merely an observer, responsible only for monitoring this new world while adhering to the sacred rites, or had he shifted his focus toward Ascension City, as if guarding against thieves among all sword cultivators? This was what concerned Chen Zhi the most. If it were the former, then in a century’s time, Ascension City would be willing to treat Confucianism with propriety and completely resolve its grievances with the righteous world. If it were the latter, Chen Zhi would not hesitate to confront the heavens as Chen Xi in the future.

After all, every sword cultivator had their own temper.

Suddenly, Chen Zhi chuckled and asked, “Yan Quan, do you think our Hidden Official would dare to speak sternly beside Ning Yao, to act like a real man?”

Yan Quan pondered for a moment before replying, “In the past, outside the Ning residence, it seemed Ning Yao was quite compliant with our Hidden Official. However, once at home, I doubt our Hidden Official could display any heroism. I’ve heard that every time he drinks at his shop, he approaches the Ning residence like a thief. I don’t know how true that is, but it’s what everyone says in the city. There’s even a poet who swears he saw our Hidden Official return home late one night, knocking on the door for ages without anyone answering, and out of kindness, he sat with him until dawn. He often recalls that and weeps for our Hidden Official.”

Chen Zhi laughed, “The drinking culture of the Sword Qi Great Wall used to be so pure, but once two scholars arrived, it became unbearable to witness or hear.”

After a brief hesitation, Yan Quan added, “Actually, I miss our Hidden Official.”

Chen Zhi smirked and asked, “You think Chen Ping’an is smarter?”

Yan Quan shook her head, “I just think the Hidden Official is calm and collected, so others needn’t worry about making mistakes.”

Chen Zhi nodded, “Exactly.”

Ning Yao soared on her sword towards the “Sword” monument, now standing anew at the eastern edge of Ascension City.

She flew swiftly, as if a celestial being employing the divine art of traversing mountains and rivers, slicing through the sea of clouds. As she passed through a storm of lightning, any proximity was met with the overwhelming sword energy radiating from her, shredding it to pieces.

After she landed beside the stone monument, Ning Yao leaned against it and began to meditate.

Using her heart’s voice, she urged the nearby sword cultivators in Ascension City to vacate the area and move closer to the city.

Dozens of sword cultivators greeted each other and promptly took to their swords, leaving the place without hesitation.

Not long after Ning Yao summoned her sword “Tian Zhen” and broke through the heavens, the Confucian sage overseeing the skies sensed something amiss. Not only did he not obstruct the immortal sword’s journey into the vast world, but he also quickly sent word to the Confucian Temple in the Central Lands.

All around, strange phenomena erupted; the earth trembled, and the ground buckled, with mountains collapsing in an instant. Ancient beings, long dormant, revealed their colossal forms, as if punished by heaven and earth, finally presented with a chance to redeem themselves. Upon rising, a single step could shatter ridges and forge canyons. Initially, these ancient beings moved slowly, but as their eyes—like deep pools—shone with golden light, they regained a semblance of divine brilliance.

Moreover, in several miasmic abysses, other towering figures emerged, exuding overwhelming power, inhaling the spirit energy of the land as if to swallow everything within a hundred miles, draining the waters and withering the flora.

In the cosmic order, whether slumbering or watching coldly, these ancient entities shared a common understanding: if they remained inactive for another century, they would meet their end, left to be killed, driven away, or imprisoned by those outsiders. Among them, the female sword cultivator with a familiar aura was marked for elimination, yet her naturally overwhelming presence instilled fear in the vast majority of these ancient remnants. If the immortal sword “Tian Zhen” ventured forth, they could no longer tolerate it; she must be eradicated to ensure she never ascended to become the first ascendant among them.

In the southern lands, the cultivators of Tongyezhou either fled the site of trouble in panic or, some in high positions claiming enlightenment, laughed heartily at the unfolding chaos. Meanwhile, a group of cultivators who had barely managed to form the foundation of their immortal abode felt despair. Although their casualties were minimal, mostly lesser cultivators, the newly constructed ancestral hall was shattered by an inexplicable colossal being, and the surrounding spirit energy and fortune were swept away with it.

Yet, as this being made its way, it fixated on a mountain shrouded in auroras and rich in fortune, altering its path to charge ahead. With a heavy stomp, it failed to crush the formation laid upon the mountain, so it merely cast a glance at a young cultivator gazing up at it before continuing its journey, each step echoing like thunder.

That mountain, which could not be crushed by a single stomp, was the transcendent platform created by Shuzhongshu, one of the ten young candidates from the world.

One could only wonder why this was the fifth realm arriving from Tongyezhou. If not for a leak from a report disclosing heavenly secrets, no one would have known he was the young master of Liuxiazhou's Tianyu Cave.

A black-clad scholar opened his folding fan and stood alongside Shuzhongshu, smiling. “Brother Shu, we could actually intercept that being. Such a grand opportunity—let not the water flow to outsiders. If we team up, we would have the advantage of terrain, and our odds of success would be great. If we succeed, the rewards would be immense. If heaven grants us a chance, we must not refuse it.”

Clad in resplendent robes like a radiant sunset, Shuzhongshu laughed. “It’s not that I don’t trust Brother Chen Wen, but I’m just worried that if we aren’t careful, the transcendent platform will end up being someone else’s wedding dress.”

Chen Wen, coming from Bei Ju Lu Zhou, closed his fan, lightly tapping his chest as he gazed at the retreating figure of the ancient being, his expression filled with disappointment. It was as if he watched a divine stream of money flowing past him, unattainable. “To see a good opportunity and not seize it, to doubt others—Brother Shu, you’re not heroic enough. If my good friend were here, I guarantee we’d be chatting and laughing over the spoils tonight.”

Shuzhongshu asked, “Who is this good friend of yours? Brother Chen Wen seems to hold him in high regard?”

Chen Wen nodded, “We’ve fought side by side, earned money together, and have both been enemies and friends. We hit it off quite well, but in the end, I’m still the more skilled one. That good friend of mine is essentially my half-defeated opponent.”

Shuzhongshu laughed, “I doubt that’s the case.”

Chen Wen lightly tapped his face with the fan, feigning grievance. “Let me give you a kind warning, Brother Shu—there’s a custom in our Bei Ju Lu Zhou: even if you beat someone half to death, don’t hit their face.”

Shuzhongshu looked up and smiled, “What a fine woman sword immortal from Tai Ping Mountain.”

Amid their conversation, only one female cultivator from the local sect of Tongyezhou pursued the ancient remnant, her sword drawn as she crossed the borders of the transcendent platform, managing to block the path of that ancient being.

In contrast to the Tongyezhou cultivators, known for their escape, in the northern lands of Fu Yaozhou, a group of cultivators gathered under the command of a man exuding royal aura, leading over a hundred qi practitioners in a forceful attempt to detain another ancient remnant. For Huang Ting, who had recently broken through to the Jade Shield realm, it was merely a bout for amusement, while for the armored warrior from Fu Yaozhou, it was about earning fortune and good luck.

In the western lands, a young monk gently landed, one hand supporting a begging bowl and the other holding a staff, effortlessly confining an ancient remnant within a lotus pool.

Looking down at the tiny ancient remnant, no larger than a mustard seed, thrashing helplessly against the waves, the monk felt a mix of emotions.

To the east, a young cultivator from the Sword Immortal lineage of the Da Xuan Guo met up with two practitioners from the Year-End Palace mid-journey, joining forces to hunt down one of the ancient remnants that had appeared.

Even so, four remnants managed to slip through and arrived at the vicinity of the “Sword” monument.

Ning Yao, having waited long, found herself bored with no one around. She played hopscotch repeatedly until, still feeling restless, she squatted down, gathering a pile of similarly sized pebbles and flipping them over one by one.

But as soon as she sensed the presence of the ancient remnants, she sprang to her feet. The first of the four beings to approach the sword monument seemed to share a connection with the other three, not in a hurry to attack. Only after the four colossal figures occupied their corners did they slowly begin to converge upon Ning Yao, who had temporarily lost her sword “Tian Zhen.”

Ning Yao allowed them to surround her, lightly tapping her toes to kick the pebbles into the air.

She casually glanced at one of the ancient remnants, which reminded her of thousands of Chen Ping’an practicing their punches.

A slight smile tugged at Ning Yao's lips, only to be quickly suppressed.

Raising her hand, she drew an immortal sword from its sheath and held it firmly.

Simultaneously, she no longer needed to question her life-bound sword “Tian Zhen” as it manifested itself.

In an instant, it pierced through the skull of an ancient remnant, which was left dangling as if suspended by a fine thread.

The swift momentum of “Slaying Immortals” captured the ancient remnant as if ensnared by threads of sword energy; any struggle would leave behind numerous deep gashes.

Ning Yao’s shadow separated from her, wielding a sword immortal.

Like a master of the ascendant realm employing the divine art of shrinking mountains and rivers, a small figure suddenly appeared before the towering ancient remnant. With both hands on the sword, she slashed diagonally.

Meanwhile, the earth below brimmed with a mist of sword energy, filling a thousand-mile radius as if enveloped in clouds.

Above, the skies gathered like a sea, gradually descending.

There was no small world, only the essence of the sword.

One ancient remnant flailed its arms wildly, golden light swirling around its massive body, still caught in the cloud of sword energy, fiercely battling against the tangible sword light with its arms and golden glow.

The gigantic form of the ancient remnant, split in two by Ning Yao’s sword light, resembled a stream of molten gold, akin to blood from a cultivator, intertwining and mending its wounds.

With each cut from the sword immortal, the battlefield was orderly, unlike other chaotic arenas. A long sword wielded with the utmost killing intent unleashed hundreds of chaotic sword lights.

Ning Yao manifested a colossal form clad in golden robes, riding the wind away from the sword monument. Holding a sword forged from condensed sword energy, she severed the head of an ancient remnant and then plunged the sword into its skull, causing the decapitated remnant to tumble backward, only to be pinned down by Ning Yao’s avatar, as she thrust the sword again through the remnant’s head, effectively reducing it to a headless corpse.

One arm of the fallen ancient remnant was pinned down by Ning Yao’s avatar, while the other attempted to break her ankle. With a swift motion, Ning Yao bent down, seized the remnant's wrist, and tossed it away with ease.

As for Ning Yao’s true self, she remained in place. The real threat in this skirmish did not lie with these four nearly indestructible ancient remnants but rather in the impending heavenly tribulation.

They sought to take advantage of the absence of the immortal sword “Tian Zhen” from this realm, unleashing a calamity that should have followed an immortal’s breakthrough, to suppress Ning Yao.

It seemed that Ning Yao’s true self, appearing entirely unbothered, stood quietly waiting for the heavenly tribulation. From the very beginning, she had prepared for the worst. Even if “Tian Zhen” could return to the battlefield, it would likely slow its return intentionally, allowing her to suffer damage and fall in rank after the tribulation, creating an opportunity to reverse her identity from sword attendant to sword master.
Ning Yao couldn't help but think that the sword spirit, resembling a troublesome little girl, was truly naive—her thoughts were just as innocent as her name suggested.

The four ancient remnants appeared to be beyond Ning Yao's reach, but in reality, she found it equally challenging to annihilate them completely. They always seemed to rise from the ashes, spreading across a thousand miles, manifesting countless golden rivers and streams, only to instantly reshape their golden bodies. Each time, her life-bound flying sword would sever their essence, sword qi would sweep like a cloud, and her avatar and shadow would shatter their forms one by one.

This was the unique flaw of sword cultivators: while their flying swords and sword qi were incredibly powerful, surpassing all others, they were most afraid of missing their target. If there were a few superior spells or methods that could isolate and imprison the golden blood representing the essence of the Great Dao, or even refine it on the spot, the battle would have ended much sooner.

Because on the ground, the golden blood flowing like rivers could be cut and shattered by Ning Yao's swords and qi, but as something more refined than the natural spiritual energy (Qi), it could not be dealt with like ordinary foes. The principle was simple: as long as the flying sword pierced through an enemy's body and soul, the sword qi could linger within, disrupting the practitioner’s hidden chambers and spiritual nodes as if they were paradisiacal caves.

However, without that increasingly manifesting heavenly tribulation, even if both sides continued to exhaust their resources in this manner—one diminishing the golden body of the Dao and the other depleting mental and spiritual energy—Ning Yao still had a greater chance of victory. Those golden blood remnants, seemingly aligned with the Great Dao, would suffer innate damage when the ancient remnants attempted to gather and reshape their golden bodies, even if the flying swords caused no visible damage.

The four ancient remnants were evidently different from those she had fought before. The previous ones were not nearly as tenacious. 

Ning Yao looked up, and it seemed as if a golden halo hung in the sky, resembling the eye of an ancient high deity, fixated on her.

On the ground, the four ancient remnants gradually melted away like snow, converging into a vast golden sea of blood. In an instant, a towering golden deity, towering ten thousand feet high, emerged, with a golden halo hovering behind it like a future divine wheel.

On the deity's arms, the essence of the Great Dao manifested, intertwining with golden dragons and serpents.

The divine being gazed down upon the mortal realm.

The sword cultivator questioned the heavenly court.

Ning Yao raised her head high, locking eyes with the deity that no longer hid its identity.

According to the secret records of the Summer Retreat Palace, among the twelve ancient high deities, one commanded the single-eyed creatures under its banner, governing the rewards and punishments of the world’s dragons and aquatic spirits. One of its duties was to collaborate with a high deity of the Thunder Department, overseeing the Dragon Transformation Pool and the Dragon Slaying Platform.

This high deity, whose Dao was damaged on the ancient battlefield, was slowly mending its essence after a millennium of silence in the Fifth Realm, gradually aligning with the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, it was the very embodiment of the heavenly tribulation.

No wonder it was so difficult to kill.

No wonder Bai Ye had never struck down this remnant; it had become part of the world itself.

In this moment, it was unthinkable for Ning Yao not to strike with her sword. She had long been displeased with all entities related to true dragons—close or distant, human or otherwise, those with whom she had spoken or not.

Her life-bound flying sword hovered beside her shoulder, her shadow returned to her, and she donned the golden robes of a celestial sword cultivator.

At that moment, Ning Yao squinted, a bit surprised.

First, a streak of sword light broke through the heavens, seemingly headed toward the Ascension City. 

Then, an even more complete streak of pure white sword light pierced through the sky, cutting straight through the back of the deity’s head. The sword light became clearer, revealing a little girl dressed in white. As she collided, her dress was wrapped in countless fine golden threads. She stumbled as if drunk, mumbling incoherently about “crunchy, crunchy,” before wobbling and falling headlong into the earth at Ning Yao's feet.

The ancient deity, once again diminished, silently dissipated and departed.

Ning Yao hesitated only for a moment before deciding to deal with the Ascension Realm later. 

She bent down and, like pulling a stubborn weed, yanked the little girl-like sword spirit, “Innocence,” out of the ground.

Ning Yao asked, “What is it?”

The little girl sat cross-legged on the ground, arms crossed, cheeks puffed out as she huffed, “I won’t say.”

———

Inside Ascension City.

A young scholar traveling through the area found the spitting-words Zheng tavern keeper, bowing politely, “Zhao Yao pays respects to Mr. Zheng.”

Today, the tavern was bustling with business, thanks to Ning Yao’s sword sacrifice and travels, along with the two sudden streaks of sword light that had descended, creating a commotion throughout Ascension City with people clamoring for drinks.

Zheng Dafeng smiled and stood up, “Congratulations.”

Zhao Yao nodded slightly, not denying the great fortune that had come his way.

Though young in appearance, he was nearly forty in reality.

Zheng Dafeng had actually favored Zhao Yao the most when he was at Pearly Jade Cave, chatting with him while he left on a bullock cart. Each time Zheng visited the school, he would often share a game of Go with Master Qi, while Zhao Yao would quietly observe, occasionally pouring wine for Mr. Zheng.

Zheng Dafeng put an arm around Zhao Yao’s shoulders, “Zhao Yao, there are many beautiful girls here, but too bad you arrived late, there aren’t many left for you. Uncle Zheng will help you pick a few. Names, families, ages, temperaments, and cultivation levels—I’ve compiled a little booklet. I charge my friends for it, but you’re exempt. Just keep coming to my tavern; it’s enough. A scholar like you is especially sought after, especially a young and promising one with handsome features. I’ve just aged a bit, or it wouldn’t be your turn.”

Zhao Yao smiled bitterly, “Mr. Zheng, please don’t jest with your junior.”

Years of distant travels had matured Zhao Yao significantly. In his youth, he had crossed continents to the Central Divine Continent, initially facing misfortune but then finding fortune on that lonely island, meeting a person of great renown, whose identity he was unaware of at the time. After disembarking, he traveled and eventually settled at a Taoist temple on Longhu Mountain, practicing Taoist teachings, honing his heart, not for levels, but to resolve his inner turmoil. Upon hearing about the appearance of the Fifth Realm, Zhao Yao descended the mountain, wandering until he reached Ascension City. Because of this choice, it would take him over eighty years to return to his homeland of Baoping Continent.

Zheng Dafeng, with a serious demeanor, replied, “Spreading branches and leaves, passing down the incense—how can such matters be jested about?”

Zhao Yao smiled but remained silent.

Mr. Zheng’s congratulations stemmed from that streak of sword light, which surprised Zhao Yao as well.

Among the four celestial swords, the Taibai sword had split into four, gifted to four individuals.

Chen Pingan. Liu Cai, Fei Ran, Zhao Yao.

The tip of the sword, possessing the greatest killing power, the segment with the most sword qi, and the weightiest hilt—all contained a remnant of Bai Ye’s swordsmanship. Ultimately, each of the four young men received one.

Zheng Dafeng elbowed away two familiar drunks, pulling Zhao Yao to sit at one of the tavern tables, ordering two bowls of the best and most expensive wine.

Zheng Dafeng softly asked, “What brings you here? You’ve truly spent over a hundred years away from home, aren’t you?” 

Zhao Yao smiled, “Just curious about this new realm; there’s no special reason. I actually regret it now.”

Zheng Dafeng sighed lightly, deciding to let it go—some things were best left unsaid. 

After finishing a bowl of wine, Zhao Yao suddenly turned to glance off into the distance, stood up to settle the bill, and departed without Zheng Dafeng trying to retain him.

It seemed Zhao Yao had casually wandered to the entrance of a bustling street.

Ning Yao moved swiftly with her sword, casting an illusion, for behind her floating sword, a little girl was seated.

Upon landing at the Ning residence, Ning Yao retracted her sword into its sheath, and the little girl simply plopped down onto the ground.

Ning Yao ascended the steps, ignoring the girl behind her, leaving the little one to pick herself up and follow along.

Zhao Yao expected her to glance his way for a greeting, but to his surprise, she remained oblivious. He had no choice but to call out, “Miss Ning.”

Ning Yao paused and turned to ask, “Who are you?”

Zhao Yao smiled, “Pearly Jade Cave, Zhao Yao.”

Ning Yao inquired, “And then?”

Initially, Ning Yao truly didn’t recognize him, assuming he was merely a cultivator from Fuyou Continent passing through. However, due to the four celestial swords, she guessed he might have acquired a part of the Taibai sword and perhaps even a portion of Bai Ye’s swordsmanship. But so what? What did it have to do with her?

When Zhao Yao finally introduced himself, Ning Yao recalled her travels to Pearly Jade Cave, where he had been with Master Qi under the archway. 

Zhao Yao found himself at a loss for words. Just as he was about to say a few polite phrases, he noticed the peculiar little girl, who had been hiding her identity, pulling at Ning Yao’s sleeve, saying in a childish voice, “Mom, Dad is doing well! He just got a piece of the Taibai sword's tip. Mom, you and Dad should discuss it as my dowry, right? We’re still young, so I can’t bear to leave Mom and Dad. Let’s just save it for later according to Dad’s customs.” 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 857: The Sword Bearer**

Above the vast battlefield between the Jade Guizong's protective formation and the military encampment of the Wild World, a figure clad in a vivid red robe hovered in mid-air. This was Zhongguang, a powerful demon of the Ascension realm, wearing a robe known as “Chencai.” After entering the Haoran World, he had taken charge of the military affairs of the three main encampments. In Tongye Continent, he had refined countless souls from the battlefield, making his robe even more resplendent. Upon closer inspection, one could see that whenever the surface of the robe rippled slightly, it revealed the horrific scenes of vast rivers and rolling seas of blood within a miniature world, where millions of souls screamed as they were subjected to a hellish refining process. This robe was Zhongguang's attempt to recreate a “Yuming Guangyin” (Light of the Shadow and Brightness), serving as the fundamental opportunity for him to ascend to the Fourteen Realms in the future.

Currently, there were no other battles taking place in Tongye Continent; all his focus was on the Jade Guizong. The military camp of the Jiazi Account had promised that if Zhongguang could kill Jiang Shangzhen, it would be equivalent to the merits of an Ascended being, comparable to Xiaoxian Sword slaying the previous sect master of the Jade Guizong, Xun Yuan.

Furthermore, because of the young Hidden Official from the Sword Qi Great Wall who donned a robe of similar hue, Zhongguang had been given the nickname “Old Hidden Official,” which he took pride in.

As the powerful demon Zhongguang waited for the downfall of the Jade Guizong, he suddenly looked up and, without hesitation, called forth his innate divine ability. A long river of fresh blood flowed out from his wide sleeves. Without the constraints of the robe, the anguished wails of hundreds of thousands of shattered souls echoed throughout the heavens and earth as the blood river surged towards a golden talisman, which appeared abruptly and radiated an overwhelming aura of righteousness that made Zhongguang's heart tremble. He did not dare to delay; almost instantaneously, countless talismans manifested, depicting the mountains and rivers of Tongye Continent, as well as the ancestral mountains of various sects and their cave abodes. The mountains stood tall, the rivers wound around them, creating a harmonious landscape of the continent.

Could it be the talismans of the Central Divine Continent?

Zhongguang hesitated for a moment, then commanded the powerful spirits within the blood river to retreat slightly to the rear, for at the battlefield, Yuan Shou was overseeing the military. Zhongguang had privately made an agreement with Yuan Shou—he only needed Jiang Shangzhen's life, while everything else concerning the Jade Guizong, its peaks, and cultivators would belong to Yuan Shou.

A youthful Daoist with a strikingly elegant demeanor and an ancient air emerged at the southern battlefield of Tongye Continent, wielding a self-created talisman for traversing mountains and rivers. Clad in a yellow-purple Dao robe, he held a Five Thunder Dharma Seal in one hand while forming sword gestures with the other. A brilliant white rainbow suddenly lit up the heavens and earth, making it hard for onlookers to tell whether it was a talisman technique or a flying sword of a sword immortal as it cleaved the blood river in half.

Zhongguang was filled with terror and despair, no longer daring to flaunt his shadowy divine abilities in front of this person. He desperately tried to retract the splintered blood river back into his sleeves. However, the noble from the Dragon Tiger Mountain's Tianshi Mansion, dressed in yellow and purple, performed another set of incantations, and a square cage of mountains and waters emerged within a hundred miles of Zhongguang, as if he were trapped within an ethereal seal. With a single hand raised, the Dharma Seal suddenly grew as large as a mountain and crashed down onto the head of the Ascended demon.

Zhongguang was forced to reveal his true form but still could not break free from the Dharma Seal. In fact, he was pinned straight to the ground. The demon's true form was held down, unwilling to yield, as he pushed against the ground, trying to lift the Dharma Seal off him.

Zhongguang excelled in attrition battles, and his innate evasion technique was unparalleled in the Wild World. Therefore, even when facing a great sword immortal, he felt no fear. For instance, even against the ten prominent figures from the Central Divine Continent, although he might not have a great chance of winning if he fought against one of them, at least he could retreat, albeit in a disheveled manner, suffering some losses beyond his true essence. Yet, he feared the talismans of the Central Divine Continent and especially dreaded the rumored Zhao Tianlai from Dragon Tiger Mountain, who wielded both the Tianshi Seal and a celestial sword.

The young Daoist landed atop the Dharma Seal, and as his feet touched the surface, the seal descended with unstoppable force, pinning the struggling demon back down. Dust erupted from the battlefield, obscuring the sky.

In addition to the overwhelming pressure of the Dharma Seal upon the demon, there were over nine thousand lightning whips, creating a spectacular scene akin to four waterfalls cascading onto the earth, trapping the demon who sought to escape underground. The Dharma Seal not only suppressed the demon but also aimed to refine him on the spot.

A staff came crashing down with a mighty force, reminiscent of the sound of heaven splitting apart.

The young Tianshi remained completely still on the Dharma Seal, revealing a figure in a Dao robe, sleeves billowing, exuding the yellow-purple aura of Dao energy. He raised one hand to block the descending staff while simultaneously forming incantations with the other. Lightning coalesced, brimming with boundless creation, and ultimately, his two fingers converged to unleash a five-thunder counterattack against the seated demon Yuan Shou, the thunderous force exploding right before Yuan Shou's eyes.

The impact left Yuan Shou reeling, his vision blurry, and he could only retreat, stepping back dozens of miles before steadying himself.

What a fine Daoist! What incredible thunder techniques! Truly, he was worthy of being the Grand Tianshi of Dragon Tiger Mountain.

Although Yuan Shou did not particularly care for the life or death of the Ascended demon beneath the Dharma Seal, having Zhongguang die right under his nose would ultimately be hard to explain to the Jiazi Account, especially considering Zhou Mi, who now made Yuan Shou wary. After discussing with Yang Zhi, both parties had decided to keep their distance from Zhou Mi, which is why Yuan Shou had come to the southern battlefield of the Jade Guizong while Yang Zhi headed to the battlefield in Nanposao.

Zhao Tianlai's Dharma form had the yellow and purple Dao energies converging within three dantians, resembling three swirling celestial bodies, the stars shifting and changing, dense yet orderly.

One hand blocked the staff, while another incantation sent Yuan Shou retreating. Zhao Tianlai's true form scanned the surroundings, a faint smile on his lips as he raised a pristine white hand, translucent and ethereal. He focused his gaze on a point, his eyes shimmering with the light of the sun and moon, before softly commanding, “Freeze.”

My Dharma is resolute, my spirit focused, my Qi unified with the true essence, adept at countering evasion techniques.

While countless demons and spirits can change forms and hide, they cannot shift even a strand of their shadow in my mirror.

The Grand Tianshi of Dragon Tiger Mountain employed an exquisite mirror technique to freeze Zhongguang, who appeared to be shedding his outer skin, trapping him in a river of time that seemed to be frozen.

The great demon Zhongguang roared, “Yuan Shou, save me!”

“Useless fool, only knowing how to make noise!” Yuan Shou scolded, but still chose to rescue Zhongguang. Suddenly towering a thousand feet, he smashed his staff towards the Tianshi's Dharma form. The latter's hands were clasped in a way that contained the five-fingered technique of thunder, one of Dragon Tiger Mountain's secret techniques.

It is said that wherever there are demons causing trouble, there will be a Peach Wood Sword Tianshi.

What they do not know is that the Tianshi of Dragon Tiger Mountain also has incantations and talismans for crossing mountains and rivers, curing illnesses, exorcising demons, and controlling spirits; the thunder techniques are immense, capable of driving away evil spirits. The great power and prestige can obliterate countless demons.

Ordinary Tianshi would simply follow their words and manifest the thunder techniques, but the Grand Tianshi's Dharma form modified the technique, with the five thunders wrapping around his wrists, while his two hands turned away in opposition. With the middle and ring fingers interlinked, his left hand spun outward, ultimately positioning both palms upward, radiating boundless creation, thunder rumbling, while simultaneously the index fingers and pinky fingers interlocked, executing an effortless counteracting seal.

Coupled with the pent-up five-thunder technique from earlier, Zhao Tianlai's Dharma form now possessed two seals, the Dao powers intertwining in his hands like a heavenly calamity of thunder hanging over the battlefield.

Yet this young Daoist from afar seemed still unsatisfied. In the blink of an eye, he formed the Ziwai Seal and invoked a mysterious divine ability, generating myriad techniques from a single principle. The Ziwai handprint stood firm as a mountain, while the Dharma form's hands shifted slightly, generating the Demon-repelling Seal and the Heavenly Gang Seal in one breath.

Then, using the Three Pure Ones technique, he conjured the Three Mountains Seal, which transformed into the Five Peaks Seal, ultimately culminating in the secret “Thunder Array” of Dragon Tiger Mountain.

One principle births myriad techniques, and all techniques return to the thunder.

An Eight Trigrams formation slowly revolved around his hands, accompanied by the grand cosmic movements of the Three Mountains, all while the five thunders gathered in creation.

Now, having arrived at the battlefield, he uttered not a word and prepared to slay a young Ascended demon, while his Dharma Seal had already suppressed Zhongguang. It seemed he also aimed to settle the score with Yuan Shou.

This Grand Tianshi of Dragon Tiger Mountain appeared intent on deciphering all the true meanings of heavenly Dao on his own.

The series of hand seals, techniques, and thunder arrays were executed by Zhao Tianlai's Dharma form in the blink of an eye, to the point where even a Jade Purity realm cultivator could not discern how many incantations Zhao Tianlai had executed, let alone how he manipulated his techniques. Moreover, it seemed Zhao Tianlai did not need to chant incantations to stabilize the essence of his Dao, making it not merely a mysterious and profound manifestation of his will but rather the flowing principle of “the heart gives rise to the Dao, and all techniques converge into one” among the peak cultivators.

At last, as the Grand Tianshi's Dharma form concluded its incantations, all the techniques converged into a single sword technique.

It was as if he cradled the sun, radiating with brilliant light, resembling ninety thousand sword energies shooting forth all at once.

The cultivators of the Jade Guizong and the invading army from the Wild World, regardless of distance, had no choice but to shut their eyes immediately, not daring to look even a moment longer.

After a brief silence, the world was still.

Was it merely the illusion of thunderous sound with little rain?

But upon closer inspection, Yuan Shou was suddenly without his staff, instead holding a sword in one hand, standing in mid-air a hundred miles away, dragging the severely injured Zhongguang, whose back was a bloody mess. Despite his resilient body as an Ascended being, he showed no signs of healing.

The great demon Zhongguang, barely hanging on, said weakly, “Thank you, Elder Yuan, for your life-saving grace.”

Yuan Shou looked down and, without warning, released his grip, stomping his foot through Zhongguang’s chest, giving a slight twist of his ankle, further mangling his opponent’s torso. He raised the sword to press against the demon’s forehead, furious, “So you were just playing dead this whole time?! Do you think my innate item is worthless?!”

Zhongguang allowed Yuan Shou to vent his frustrations, knowing that the injuries inflicted by Yuan Shou paled in comparison to the profound effects of Zhao Tianlai’s Dharma Seal. The turmoil within the blood sea of his innate robe during this chaotic battle nearly caused all the benefits he had gained in Tongye Continent to be returned. Yet, he was still grateful that Yuan Shou was willing to wield his sword and cast a sword technique to save him; he dared not touch the sword tip.

Zhongguang helplessly said, “Elder Yuan, that Grand Tianshi of Dragon Tiger Mountain, with his sword seal and techniques, naturally has the upper hand against my divine abilities. If you suffer losses today, I will repay you double.”

Yuan Shou extended his arm and produced a long staff inscribed with “Calm the Sea,” though it was considerably more damaged than before. After enduring two major battles against Bai Ye and Zhao Tianlai, this staff was practically a shell of its former self. Unless he could refine a great river, its restoration seemed unlikely. The nearer river, the Treasure Bottle Continent's Qidu, and the farther, the North Julu Continent's Jidu, were now places Yuan Shou was reluctant to approach.

Zhongguang stood up, his heart filled with grief and indignation. Aside from the damage to his robe and the suppression by the Tianshi Seal, the countless lightning whips that had refined his body left his spirit far more wounded than his appearance suggested. In the Wild World, where strength reigns supreme, many conflicts over the Dao are resolved through combat; once his true condition was revealed to the nearby three military encampments, many ambitious younger demons would likely stir, seeking to take his place.

Zhao Tianlai had already retracted the Dharma Seal. Throughout the entire confrontation against both Yuan Shou and the Ascended demon, this contemporary Grand Tianshi remained unconcerned and unfazed.

Of course, this was partly due to Yuan Shou’s reluctance to truly engage in a life-or-death struggle.

He arrived at the ancestral mountain of the Jade Guizong and bowed to the sect master, Jiang Shangzhen, who had been waiting for him.

The Tianshi Mansion of Dragon Tiger Mountain, known as the Wulei Boy, was responsible for guarding the place. He sat cross-legged outside the Demon Suppression Hall, staring at the heavily reinforced talisman seal passed down by the great Tianshi.

As for the celestial sword “Wanfang,” its sheath had been left by the young Daoist near the well.

Jiang Shangzhen offered a somewhat improper greeting, which was considered an enormous gesture. However, this sort of person, who acted without inhibition, was willing to do whatever the Grand Tianshi required, even if it meant rubbing shoulders or giving a back massage.

Jiang Shangzhen smiled and said, “The Grand Tianshi's techniques are unmatched, flowing freely; I, Jiang, had no opportunity to summon my flying sword. It turns out that the gap between realms is beyond measure.”

Zhao Tianlai shook his head with a smile, then remarked, “What a grueling battle; the Jade Guizong has had a tough time.”

Jiang Shangzhen replied, “Compared to our own Tongye Sect, which controls an entire continent, the cultivators of the Jade Guizong indeed possess a harder resolve.”

The Tongye Sect in the northern part of Tongye Continent had now submitted to the Jiazi Account, becoming a group of decrepit old fools, effectively turning into bandits.

Thus, the vast lands equivalent to two and a half Treasure Bottle Continents remained with only the Jade Guizong still resisting. After the Tongye Sect defected to the Jiazi Account, the Jade Guizong found itself in an even more precarious position. If it weren't for the sect master Jiang Shangzhen's return, the continent would have likely seen little fighting by now.

Jiang Shangzhen had been forced to confront the dire situation of the continent, returning to his sect after being compelled to do so. He felt somewhat troubled; if the Jade Guizong were not on the verge of collapse, he would have preferred to continue wandering freely, like a street rat, earning merits without a care.

Indeed, the seat of the sect master in the Ancestor Hall felt quite hot. Had he known this, he would have preferred to be like Brother Zhou Fei, roaming the continent and throwing a sword before making a quick escape; that would have been delightful.

The Ancestor Hall of the Jade Guizong, once filled with Ascended realm cultivators, now had half of its seats empty. Not to mention various ancestors and direct descendants—many guest cultivators had also perished.

What was worse, an abundance of youthful faces had simply vanished without a trace, each sacrificing themselves valiantly, believing they had died for a noble cause. How foolish! Even Jiang Shangzhen, who prided himself on being unyielding and unfeeling, couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow near heartbreak.

Jiang Shangzhen asked, “Grand Tianshi, has Bai Ye truly died?”

Zhao Tianlai nodded, “If we speak of Bai Ye in the Fourteen Realms, it can be said that he has indeed perished. The world no longer has the celestial sword Taibai.”

Jiang Shangzhen sighed, “This battle has claimed many lives.”

Zhao Tianlai remarked, “Previously, the cultivators on the mountains of the Haoran World, especially from the Central Divine Continent, believed that the so-called Fourteen Thrones of the Wild World were at most on par with the tenth-ranked cultivators of the Central Continent. Now that Bai Ye has died, they think that the entire Haoran list, whether ten or fifteen, cannot match the Fourteen Thrones.”

Jiang Shangzhen helplessly replied, “When it comes to fighting, do the beasts of the Wild World even matter? Doesn’t the Central Divine Continent have some perspective?”

Soon, Jiang Shangzhen answered his own question: “Of course not. The Sword Qi Great Wall has its understanding, while the Haoran World lacks perspective.”

The nine sword formations of Jiu Yi Peak had long since been obliterated. Besides Zhongguang, Yuan Shou had also personally come to the Jade Guizong, ostensibly assisting Zhongguang in commanding the demon army's assault on the mountain peaks. Yet, he occasionally revealed his mountain-moving true form, smashing down upon the mountain and water formations, though he did not exert his full force or specifically target the cultivators or the ancestral mountain of Jade Guizong. He merely stated that since your mountain has wealth and a solid foundation, let’s see just how many treasures you truly possess.

Yuan Shou had even left behind a remark, “I’ve slain Bai Ye; what is a mere Ascended Jiang Shangzhen worth?”

Before the fall of the Golden Armor Continent, the military encampments of the Wild World once again employed the illusionary techniques of the mirror flowers and water moons, depicting a repeated scene of Liu Cha slaying Bai Ye of the Fourteen Realms. The Haoran World no longer had its pride, no longer possessing poetry or invincibility.

This dull yet heart-stopping scene was witnessed by the cultivators of the Jade Guizong. If it weren't for Jiang Shangzhen hearing the confirmation from the Grand Tianshi of Dragon Tiger Mountain himself, he would have never dared to believe, nor wished to accept that Bai Ye was dead.
Jiang Shangzhen had been deeply troubled for quite some time. In a moment of frustration, he once left the Mountain Water Grand Array to confront a flying ascendant beast, engaging in a fierce one-on-one duel. The battle was intense, with both sides unleashing their ultimate techniques, causing the heavens and earth to turn upside down. Not only the demon clan, but even many of the younger disciples of Yu Gui Sect were unaware of Jiang Shangzhen's true strength. Most of what they knew came from hearsay passed down by their elders and ancestors. In their early years, they had only heard about the flamboyant and notoriously infamous head of the Jiang family, renowned for his unparalleled escaping skills. Thus, whenever Jiang Shangzhen took action against opponents of higher realms, he always emerged unharmed; those of lower cultivation or equivalent realms were guaranteed to perish. It was only after witnessing that fierce battle that they realized how formidable the head of the Jiang clan truly was, as he wielded his willow leaf blade with unmatched ferocity.

Zhao Tianlai spoke apologetically, “The immortal sword techniques must remain in Longhu Mountain, as there is a high chance that unforeseen events may arise.”

Surprisingly, Jiang Shangzhen, usually brimming with a roguish demeanor, appeared solemn and nodded sincerely, “The Celestial Master has gone to such lengths to come here to eradicate demons; we at Yu Gui Sect will not be so ungrateful as to wish for more.”

This was the ease of dealing with truly wise individuals.

Squatting at the cliff’s edge, Jiang Shangzhen quietly said, “The Celestial Master should take a moment to rest and guard that phoenix tree. It is the core of the Demon Suppression Tower's formation. Yu Gui Sect can hold out for a while longer—up to six months or as little as three. However, when the time comes for your departure, I would appreciate it if you could take away a Cloud Cave blessing. I’ll have some of the younger ones thrown into the blessing with their heads held down. As for the older and more senior disciples, they can choose to stay if they wish.”

Zhao Tianlai suggested, “Given the circumstances, it may be better for Jiang Zongzhu to lead everyone to relocate. If people are saved, there is still hope for the land. But if people perish while the land remains, then both will surely be lost.”

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, “Unlike Tai Ping Mountain or Fu Qi Sect, Yu Gui Sect cannot learn from them. But no matter who we learn from, we must not imitate Tongye Sect. No matter how shameless Jiang Shangzhen becomes, I still need to maintain some dignity. If I were not the sect leader, I could leave whenever I wanted. But since I have taken on this role, even if it means suffering humiliation, I must endure it. Moreover, if I leave, the spirit and resolve accumulated by generations of Yu Gui Sect cultivators over thousands of years will be ruined in my hands. Even if the sect appears prosperous in the future, with numerous disciples, it will merely be a hollow shell made of bamboo and paper.”

Zhao Tianlai nodded with a smile, looking at Jiang Shangzhen with newfound respect.

Rumors circulated on the mountain—truths and lies alike. The grand reports from the Mountain Water Mansion often contained grandiloquent phrases that were mostly just talk. In contrast, some seemingly trivial statements concealed profound righteousness.

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly pulled a blade of grass from somewhere and began chewing on it, laughing lightly as he looked up and said, “Years ago, I brought back a sister known as Jiu Niang from the Great Qian Dynasty. I heard she has some connections with the celestial fox at Longhu Mountain. Jiu Niang is proud and haughty, always indifferent to this decorative sect leader, yet she has always held admiration for the Great Celestial Master. How about I take this opportunity to call her over to bask in the celestial aura? Who knows, perhaps she will be kinder to me in the future. After all, debts are best settled; Great Celestial Master, please don’t hold this against me?”

Zhao Tianlai smiled and replied, “Of course, that would be fine.”

The innkeeper Jiu Niang at the Great Qian Dynasty’s border inn was, in fact, the Lady of the Laundress, a nine-tailed celestial fox. However, the renowned protector of Longhu Mountain, Lian Zhen, was a ten-tailed celestial fox.

After receiving Jiang Shangzhen’s “imperative” message, Jiu Niang immediately rode the wind from where Jiang Shangzhen had once cultivated and landed at a distance from the two. She then hurried over and offered a deep bow of respect to the Great Celestial Master, Zhao Tianlai returning the gesture with a proper Daoist salute.

Jiang Shangzhen paid no attention to this; instead, he squatted on the cliff’s edge, gazing into the distance. He suddenly recalled the meeting that was initially meant to congratulate the old sect master on breaking through. He thought of how Old Xun had stared blankly at the shifting white clouds outside the door. Jiang Shangzhen knew that Old Xun was not fond of poetry, but he had a particular fondness for a lyrical piece that contained the phrase “returning home.” The reason was rather peculiar; it was simply because the three characters at the beginning had made Old Xun fond of it for a lifetime.

“The Yu family is poor.”

Old Sect Master Xun Yuan was, in essence, a man born in the mountains, without worries about food or cultivation, and his path through life had been smooth sailing. Thus, even Jiang Shangzhen could not comprehend why Old Xun, a man like him, had such a deep attachment to those three words.

Jiang Shangzhen remained in place, listening as Jiu Niang and Zhao Tianlai discussed some matters of cultivation. He chewed the grass roots until they were but remnants of nothing, still instinctively grinding his teeth.

"The Yu family is poor."

“May I borrow your green bamboo staff, so I can wander deeper into the white cloud pile, trampling my straw sandals where no one cares? Why not return to the fields?”

Jiang Shangzhen leaned back, resting his hands behind his head. 

The destitute place he served as a protector, Luan Po Mountain, had its lotus blessing elevated to an upper-tier blessing. Jiang Shangzhen was destined not to witness the ceremony. When he held the blessing and took in the refugees from Tongye Island, he had early on left some gifts there. Besides the essential heavenly materials and treasures, he had casually planted some willows, sketching out a private area in the blessing, creating a semblance of dignity befitting a protector of the ancestral hall.

Yet he did not understand why, by the riverside of the willow trees, he had personally planted the most common of wild herbs, known as Hengwu.

With willows shading the ground, the flowers bloomed.

He could only hope that one day, when the one he loved had gone far away, he would still remember her, sitting under the willow shade, watching the flowers bloom.

---

A bright red ceremonial robe hung quietly in the air, several feet above the city walls. Its sleeves draped down; if a breeze passed by, it swayed gently like a floating leaf on a river or a solitary red cloud hovering above the city.

Having grown accustomed to the isolation of heaven and earth, Chen Ping'an felt somewhat out of place when Zhou Mi unexpectedly lifted the century-old restrictions.

Fortunately, this feeling was not unfamiliar. Years ago, after practicing martial arts in a bamboo building for a long time, he had felt uncomfortable when he ventured out into the world.

Afterward, a particularly reckless demon cultivator, screaming and howling, soared over on the wind, completely ignoring the young Hidden Official standing below.

They didn’t dare to land on the city walls to admire the view, for those undying yet formidable sword spirits, each akin to earth immortals, were still stationed across the walls.

At first, Chen Ping'an worried that Zhou Mi's schemes were forcing one demon after another to fly over the city. 

He managed to engage one demon of comparable cultivation, politely inviting him to stop, exchanging pleasantries, and allowing him to present gifts. A torrent of magic techniques rained down, and Chen Ping'an took the hits while asking a few minor questions in a tone more precise than the demon's own. Unfortunately, the demon's replies were far too casual, treating him as an honored guest, leaving Chen Ping'an with no useful information. In the end, he had no choice but to disperse his form, while the Golden Elixir demon laughed heartily. Meanwhile, the Hidden Official crouching behind him on the city wall rubbed his chin, eyeing the powerful demon with a mix of amusement and indecision.

Why couldn't he be more like a man?

Except for the unfortunate demon that had crossed paths with Chen Ping'an and was swiftly dispatched by his hand, the previous Hidden Official, Xiao Xian, and the sword drawn by the Dragon Monarch were among the top ten young sword cultivators in a contest of magical prowess.

Who could just kill a Hidden Official like that?

So, as a courtesy, Chen Ping'an twisted the head off that Golden Elixir demon, disregarding the headless body. He simply tossed the severed head high into the air and sent it flying hundreds of feet away with a kick.

With the restrictions lifted, such bizarre and amusing events became commonplace. 

Some demon cultivators, wary of crossing the city walls, chose merely to hover in the air, getting a closer view of the inscriptions on the city walls.

On the opposite wall, a young demon warrior had climbed up and boldly declared his intention to spar with Chen Ping'an, but he would need to wait another thirty years to hone his skills.

Three demon sword immortals from the far southern territories of the Wilds had also come riding their swords, not to traverse the land of righteousness but merely to enjoy the scenery before turning back home.

A group of young female demon cultivators, likely from large sects, were quite daring, using several white cranes and green phoenixes to pull a massive carriage. They stood atop, chattering away. One of them, using a technique to observe mountains and rivers, finally spotted the young Hidden Official in his bright red robe. They all beamed with excitement, as if they had spotted their ideal partner.

Goodness! Did they all think this was a scenic spot far away in the heavens?

Chen Ping'an raised a hand, summoning a cluster of thunder, releasing a formidable strike. 

The young woman in palace attire, employing her technique of observing mountains and rivers, seemed to have her mind flooded with confusion. Rather than dispersing the thunder, she used her own higher-tier technique to contain it in her sleeve, causing a large part of her robe's sleeve to explode. Yet instead of feeling any regret, she happily shook her sleeve, wearing a smug expression as she flaunted it among her friends.

Chen Ping'an stood on the city wall, smiling and waving to the resplendent carriage, thinking, “You want some thunder, huh? Come a bit closer; I'm known for cherishing beauty, so I'll give you more. In return, all you have to do is leave behind that phoenix carriage.”

By its appearance, it was undoubtedly an imperial carriage. Apart from the celestial birds, the wheels were crafted from refined moonlight and sunlight. As for the exterior decorations, they were extravagant, adorned with patterns from the Yuluo Xiaotai and the Jade Capital's Danque. If it was just a magical artifact and not half-immortal-grade, then all those years of being the burden carrier would have been in vain.

Unfortunately, the carriage remained suspended, and the young female cultivators stared at it with sparkling eyes, suddenly quieting down, fixated on the young Hidden Official in the red robe, whispering amongst themselves as if evaluating the legendary Hidden Official.

The wheel of fortune had turned; previously, only Chen Ping'an had found the Dragon Monarch and Lian Zhen annoying, but now, karma had caught up with him.

A gust of wind swept over the city walls, causing the striking red robe to flutter once more.

Countless demon cultivators had come to the Sword Qi Great Wall for sightseeing, yet the number of reckless demons seeking their demise had dwindled considerably.

Yet Chen Ping'an took none of the rewards, acting very uncharacteristically for a burden carrier.

He appeared to be in a deep sleep, hands resting on his abdomen, breathing steadily, his back leaning against a narrow sword, which was concealed beneath his oversized robe.

Thoughts drifted through Chen Ping'an's mind, intertwining and colliding, chaotic yet unrestrained. 

In the realm of law, all was equal, with no distinctions of high or low. With no burdens on his mind, he was free from fear, far removed from chaotic dreams.

The Confucian sage stationed at the city’s edge once mentioned his contemplation of the struggle between humanity and heavenly principles, yet he could never pinpoint the reason why. He merely felt that the existing conclusions were somewhat unsatisfactory.

The treasures on the mountain of Fu Qi Sect’s Tianjie were indeed remarkable, but the prices were exorbitant.

When Yue Qing and Mi Hu fell in battle, the city had already ascended far away. Those traveling sword cultivators had not witnessed the final draws of the two great sword immortals in their lifetimes.

The two great sword immortals, the reserve members among the top ten at the Sword Qi Great Wall, had departed without a word, leaving no grand declarations behind.

Damn it, if I die here, who will tell the world about what kind of sword immortals you are and what kind of heroes you are, cutting down thieves as history books do not record?!

Damn it, you all come back to life; I want to ask about swords. Each one of you sword immortals, whether it's Yue Qing, Mi Hu, Sun Juyuan, or Gao Kui and Tao Wen, I want them all, and if I furrow my brow, I'll take your surname as that of the first sword immortal!

Beyond the sword immortals, the sword cultivators who were not sword immortals—young and old alike—faced death and loss in greater numbers. They remained on the battlefield, dying on the battlefield.

I have yet to visit Tai Ping Mountain. I have not seen the Shimmering City after the snow falls. What kind of human paradise would that be?

One of the three saints of the Celestial Realm, the lord of the White Jade Capital in the Qingming Realm, I wonder if the traveling sword cultivators like Dong Heitan and Yan Panzai will take the opportunity to explore.

I wonder what the three masters of the White Jade Capital, crowned with lotus flowers, will experience in their dreams, and how the Great Way will manifest itself.

Previously, I had seen the Ganyu Armor on Sha Yue, resembling a robe of seven colors. It’s hard not to think of the sword immortal, Zhou Cheng, who loved swinging on the city walls. Her life-bound flying sword, “Colorful,” emitted seven colors of light, akin to possessing seven life-bound flying swords. Such regrets are far too many to count.

Liu Cai. Lu Tai.

As a Qi cultivator, he was surprisingly afraid of heights. And the mysterious constitution of Lu Tai, being a direct descendant of the Lu family, lacked high cultivation. Though equipped with many magical artifacts, he managed to dispel many doubts. However, Lu Tai had no protective companions nearby and dared to undertake a journey across continents to the Baoping Continent, flipping over to both the Inverted Mountain and Tongye Island. 

The two first met at the Old Dragon City on the Fan family boat to Osmanthus Island. Later, Chen Ping'an secretly had Wei Wenlong review the boarding records from the last thirty years; Lu Tai had not boarded midway but had indeed taken the boat from Old Dragon City to Osmanthus Island. Yet Lu Tai never spoke of his travels across the Baoping Continent. 

At that time, Chen Ping'an had not been suspicious of Lu Tai but rather of the Yin-Yang family of the Central Plains, not realizing he had already considered Lu Tai a true friend, akin to the gentleman, Zhong Kui.

However, at Feiying Fortress, Chen Ping'an had experienced a strange feeling when he encountered someone. Lu Tai had mentioned having two masters. Later, Lu Tai managed to possess a woman, hinting that he was already in a divine paradise.

As the head of the Eastern Sea Daoist Temple, one of the few at the Fourteenth Realm, he was extremely strict about rules. Thus, Lu Tai, relying solely on himself, certainly did not possess the ability to break the rules of the Lotus Blossom Paradise. With the identity of the old temple master, he wouldn’t sell such a grand favor to the Central Plains’ Lu family.

So Chen Ping'an fervently hoped that the round-faced girl in cotton clothes who visited the Sword Qi Great Wall was indeed Liu Cai.

That was why Sha Yue was puzzled, asking Chen Ping'an why he would become angry after determining that she was not Liu Cai.

Chen Ping'an wasn’t furious that Lu Tai was that “one,” but rather angry that Lu Tai was gradually becoming the mastermind behind that “one.”

Chen Ping'an had even imagined countless scenarios. If they were to meet again in the future, would Lu Tai come holding a string of candied hawthorns, smiling brightly as he approached?

What to do? All he could do was wait; what else could he do?

Years of hardship after the age of four, along with a sudden life crisis, had transformed a once stubborn youth, accustomed to having nothing and feeling that he could not hold onto anything, into what seemed like another person entirely. The Great Way should not be so diminutive. Traveling through the world, there has never been a time when one could simply bypass an obstacle...

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an, who had been resting with his eyes closed, opened them. With a flick of his sleeve, he stood at the edge of the city wall.

A group of sword cultivators from the Wilds, not among the hundred sword immortals, gradually arrived at the opposite city wall. Most of them were young faces, beginning to immerse themselves in sword forging.

However, with no Dragon Monarch stationed at the city wall and the century-old restrictions lifted, over a hundred sword cultivators kept their distance from the cliff edge, to avoid having their heads casually severed by some fellow on the opposite side.

When a young demon sword cultivator grasped a strand of pure sword intent, the young Hidden Official in the bright red robe merely leaned on his sword, standing at the cliff edge, gazing into the distance at the opposing shore, unwavering.
The young swordsmanship genius, who looked youthful and was indeed still in his prime, shifted the trajectory of his flying sword slightly before heading towards the Vast Tranquil World, yet he remained extremely cautious throughout. Finally, he turned to the young Hidden Official and flashed a smile.

Chen Ping'an turned his gaze southward.

From a great distance, a radiant beam of light shot through the air, abruptly stopping and descending atop the city walls. It revealed a thin, elderly man with a delicate appearance, donned in the robes of a Daoist sect, draped with a cloak. At his waist hung a bamboo flute, gleaming like fresh green bamboo, clearly a treasured item that had seen some years.

The old man surveyed his surroundings, noticing the absence of the young man’s figure. A few faint traces lingered, shifting unpredictably, prompting him to jovially inquire in the refined dialect of the Vast Tranquil World, “Where is the Hidden Official?”

Chen Ping'an gradually revealed himself on the opposite city wall, the two separated by a road lined with the city’s walls. He smiled and asked, “Elder, you’re looking quite dapper in your Daoist robes and cloak. Your demeanor is serene and dignified, reminiscent of an immortal. Have you come in place of the Dragon Lord?”

The old man chuckled, not taking offense at the veiled jab. “I’ve been going by the name ‘Lu Fayan’ for many years, as I had long wished to visit your hometown and meet this Lu Fayan. As for my real name, coincidentally, it is inscribed upon you.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly understood. “So, Elder, you’re indeed a bit aged. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to take on the role of a teacher to pass on the nuances of poetry.”

“Indeed, the Hidden Official is quite knowledgeable and quick-witted,” the old man replied with a smile. “However, your humorous verses lack meter, and the tonal patterns are quite a challenge to endure for me, even as mere hearsay.”

Curious, Chen Ping'an asked, “Have you reached the Fourteenth Realm?”

The old man nodded.

Chen Ping'an nodded back. “That’s quite impressive. If I were to live to your age, I’d probably only reach the Eighth Realm at best.”

This old throne-demon, tutor of poetic rhyme and elegance, laughed heartily. “At such a young age, you speak like a disciple of a Medicine King, surely you’re entitled to spout a few absurdities.”

Chen Ping'an retorted with righteous indignation, “Elder, if you keep speaking in such a cryptic manner, don’t blame me for making an exception and cursing you out.”

It seemed like the two were reminiscing.

However, had they been anywhere else, as long as it wasn’t atop this harmonious city wall, Chen Ping'an might have already been shattered into pieces by a single strike or left in a fate worse than death.

Now, facing a great cultivator who had reached the Fourteenth Realm, Chen Ping'an truly felt he couldn't fight back.

The old man asked, “Would you like to know what the Sword Cultivator Dragon Lord said when he faced Chen Qingdu in his final moments?”

Chen Ping'an sighed. “What else could it be? Probably some curses, right? That old scoundrel Dragon Lord certainly excels in that regard; I’ve had my fair share of his teachings over the years and have suffered plenty.”

The old man shook his head. “Wrong. It was the words ‘Dragon Lord leads the sword.’”

Chen Ping'an let out a long sigh, realizing it was indeed so.

That would clear the old debts—those strikes of the Dragon Lord’s sword could just be considered inquiries directed at him. If he ever had the chance to return home, he could use it to provoke Liu Jinglong over drinks.

The old man asked, “So, what’s your aim in this?”

Chen Ping'an, hands tucked within his sleeves, smiled broadly. “Simply put, I’ve stood here for many years while the throne-demons come and go, yet I remain steadfast.”

“My disciple Yunqing—did she die at your hands? If she did, so be it; she never managed to persuade that old deaf man to abandon the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Suddenly, the old man said, “Did Yunqing leave any belongings behind? Perhaps that half-immortal bamboo flute named ‘Banished Immortal’?”

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

Yunqing’s bamboo flute bore an inscription, aside from the name ‘Banished Immortal’; there were also a few elegant characters: “Once granted to the dew-bearing wind.”

Now that the Dragon Lord had passed, it seemed that any item could be used at will, yet the more it seemed so, the less Chen Ping'an felt inclined to take action.

As for the five Upper Fifth Realm demon cultivators that had once been imprisoned, they included Yunqing, Qingqiu, Mengpo, Zhu Jie, and Hou Changjun. Only Yunqing had a relatively close relationship with Chen Ping'an; he often visited her for casual chats.

Chen Ping'an glanced again at the elegantly thin old demon’s bamboo flute, noticing the seven-character inscription in small seal script: “Water celery from Qizhou needs no wine.” 

It was almost identical in shape and style to Yunqing’s flute. Additionally, there was a flowing cursive inscription: “Azure waters and blue skies, two extraordinary wonders; the old flute laments anew as the bamboo may crack.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly blurted out, “So, you’re now a meticulous… wandering spirit? From once being in the Fourteenth Realm, have you fallen to this state? Isn’t that a bit too tragic? Doesn’t your ancestor from Tuo Yue Mountain care at all?”

If he had asked, “What connection do you have with Zhou Mi?” he likely wouldn’t have received any answer.

The old man sighed. “What Mr. Zhou said is true; one must indeed read more.”

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but laugh. “You enjoy praising yourself so much; did you learn that from Mr. Zhou? Have you taken him as your master?”

He firmly believed that the person before him was one of Zhou Mi’s incarnations.

Chen Ping'an continued, “Right now, my Dao heart is easily broken, for I accept my fate in the grand scheme of things. No matter how bad things get, they can’t crush me. So, did you intentionally release the seals earlier, letting the demon cultivators run amok, in hopes of catching me off guard while I was drinking or retrieving something? Or were you specifically after my hairpin?”

The old man nodded with a smile. Unfortunately, this fellow was still quite cautious. He didn’t touch the objects of the heart, the items within his reach, nor did he employ any sleeve techniques. He was even more careful than when the Dragon Lord was around.

Zhou Mi’s Yang Spirit was the throne-demon Bai Ying, who cultivated the Dao independently and gradually ascended to the throne. However, his Yin Spirit had fused with this Fourteenth Realm body; yet, such an overwhelming method of transformation was not aided by the Tuo Yue Mountain ancestor, who merely watched coldly from the sidelines. Thus, Zhou Mi had forcibly seized it with the usual methods of the wild world.

Looking at this young Hidden Official, who appeared nearly forty and was still unperturbed, Zhou Mi’s fingers moved within his sleeve, forming seals to isolate the world. He then commandeered the river of time above the city walls, slowly saying, “Chen Ping'an, I’ve changed my mind. The one in armor may be far from the truth, but the one holding the sword can replace Feiran with you.”

The young Hidden Official, jumping up, spat, “You’re so full of yourself! Why don’t you go challenge the Sage Ancestor and the Buddha instead?!”

Zhou Mi chuckled, reversing time and retracting his previous words, leading Chen Ping'an to exclaim, “My apologies, I certainly just cursed.”

Even Zhou Mi was somewhat annoyed with him. He cast his powers once more, reversing the flow of time over half the city walls until they returned to the moment of their first encounter.

This time, Chen Ping'an merely frowned, seemingly perplexed. However, there were indeed some clues—namely, the subtle changes in the weather atop the opposing city wall and the fluctuating aura of a demon swordsman. With his mind divided and spread thin, and having traversed the river of time many times, he confirmed that this person beside him had indeed manipulated things.

Before Zhou Mi’s figure faded, he simply shook his head and smiled. “Poor little sword sheath.”

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 858: Snowfall at Furong Mountain**

In Ascension City, this was the first time Nian Xin had come to visit the Ning residence.

As the deputy of the law enforcement officer, she was here to meet the current Hidden Official of Ascension City.

Ning Yao stood at the site of the former Dragon Slaying Cliff. Apart from her, on the martial arts stage, there was a girl with an ancient inkstone tied to her waist carrying a bamboo box. She was accompanied by a cute little girl in a pure white outfit, both running around, banging drums and cymbals. 

One asked about her master’s prowess and how great it was. The other answered that her dad was truly formidable, unrivaled in the world… 

One then asked what would happen when their mother came to discipline them later. The response was that she wasn’t afraid of bowing down, as long as she held the drums and gongs, she was the one in charge.

Initially, the big girl and the little girl shared a harmonious and loving bond, but suddenly they turned against each other. One claimed, “Your master is my dad, so I’m closer to him.” The other retorted, “I recognized my master first; you recognized your dad later. First come, first served, so you have to show me some respect.” Their squabble was nothing but a competition of who could make the louder noise with their drums.

Nian Xin couldn’t help but feel sorry for Ning Yao. With someone like Guo Zhujiu around, she now had to deal with this unexpected “daughter.”

Ning Yao seemed unbothered by the noise and nodded in acknowledgment to Nian Xin.

Approaching Ning Yao, Nian Xin said, “Zhao Yao has already left Ascension City after having drinks with Zheng Dafu. Qi Shou personally saw him off. It seems Zhao Yao is headed to the far west to seek guidance on Buddhist teachings from the monks at Shouxin Temple.”

Ning Yao nodded, “He probably wants to study the teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism all together.”

Could it be that he intends to follow a path similar to Mr. Qi’s?

Nian Xin smiled but refrained from speaking further.

Ning Yao asked, “What’s on your mind?”

Nian Xin replied, “I’m curious as to why you, back then, chose to wander across various states and mountains, particularly focusing on a young man named Chen Ping’an, who was living in a shabby alley at the time. Care to share?”

Logically, Ning Yao had witnessed the various sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall since childhood and then traveled far and wide in the Haoran world, so she should have encountered numerous talented young men, each with their unique charisma, heroism, and divine presence.

Ning Yao asked, “What did he say on your side?”

Nian Xin shook her head, “Chen Ping’an never talks about this.”

Ning Yao squinted slightly, a hint of amusement in her eyes.

Nian Xin felt helpless. Should she call this couple divine lovers or just a pair of foolish lovers? Even she, a seamstress indifferent to romance, found it unbearable.

So, she changed the subject, “That was just a casual question; you don’t need to answer.”

In truth, Ning Yao hadn’t intended to say much either.

The two of them strolled together, and Ning Yao turned to remind Guo Zhujiu, “You can play, but you’re not allowed to leave this area.”

Guo Zhujiu nodded vigorously, “If anything goes wrong, I’ll bring my head to see the teacher!”

The little girl dropped the drums on the ground, hands on her hips, and asked, “Whose head?”

Guo Zhujiu shot a sideways glance at the girl and, using her thoughts, said, “We’re in this together; why are you ruining the fun?”

Ning Yao ignored the children’s playful bickering. Nian Xin’s presence at the Ning residence this time was certainly not just for idle chat.

However, Ning Yao couldn’t help but glance back at Guo Zhujiu.

Guo Zhujiu immediately stood up straight.

Ning Yao knew well why Guo Zhujiu was reluctant to stay at her own home. Similarly, Ning Yao had been even more reckless in the past, having directly run away from home.

Even when Guo Zhujiu returned home, she mostly busied herself in the flower garden, carefully tending to the exotic flowers and plants she brought back from her travels, no longer wielding a sword or sweeping the ground with a stick as she once did. It seemed that as one grew up, one became more reluctant to part with such things.

Each time Chen Ping’an returned home from his travels, he would also add soil to the garden without exception, and the principle was the same.

Nian Xin communicated with Ning Yao through her thoughts, “Years ago, in prison, Chen Ping’an made a deal with a being named ‘Frostfall’ who had ascended. Frostfall earned a Gu Yu coin from Chen Ping’an, buying half of his freedom and promised to help you once. So, when you traveled far, I almost lit the wick of that lamp and released this otherworldly demon from the Qingming world.”

Ning Yao asked, “Almost?”

Nian Xin nodded, “Zheng Dafu found me and advised me not to rush into it. This person seems to be quite familiar with the inner workings of the divine path.”

Ning Yao didn’t want to elaborate on Zheng Dafu’s background. As a gatekeeper of the Fallen Mountain, he could be considered half a family member, so she simply said, “Chen Ping’an’s hometown, Lizhu Cave Heaven, is the deepest place in the world. If you deal with anyone from there in the future, you’d better get used to it early on.”

Nian Xin smiled, “I’ve already met three: Chen Ping’an, Zheng Dafu, and Zhao Yao. They’re indeed all quite peculiar.”

Ning Yao said, “You don’t need to worry about the sword ‘Innocence.’ I’ll ensure she behaves before I ascend, and then I’ll confront that ‘One-eyed Person.’ Besides that otherworldly demon who can strike from the shadows, I’ll also consult Zheng Dafu about some divine path rules first.”

Nian Xin was somewhat surprised, “I thought you would refuse outside intervention.”

Ning Yao shook her head, “I don’t see you all as outsiders. Furthermore, the path of the great dao is perilous; seeking assistance for safety is nothing to be ashamed of.”

People like Zhao Yao were the outsiders.

Knowing her relationship with Chen Ping’an, he still came to see her alone. If it weren’t for Mr. Qi, Ning Yao wouldn’t have minded sending Zhao Yao out of Ascension City.

Not sending that person off with a ceremonial sword was largely due to Ning Yao’s good mood at the moment. The half of the Sword Qi Great Wall was still standing; he was still around.

Nian Xin asked, “Should I leave that lamp wick at the Ning residence?”

Ning Yao nodded, “Do as you wish.”

Inside and outside Ascension City, no one dared to use divine sight to pry into the Ning residence. They simply didn’t have the courage, nor the cultivation level.

Nian Xin took out the oil lamp, and after adjusting the wick, a white-haired boy descended to the ground. Initially dazed, he suddenly began to weep and raised his arms, shouting, “Hidden Official Ancestor, unparalleled martial prowess, transcendent techniques, sword immortal elegance, heroic demeanor, strikingly handsome, a promise worth a thousand gold, calculations beyond measure…”

Ning Yao shot a glance at the blushing little sycophant and said to Nian Xin, “You might as well take him back.”

Nian Xin chuckled, “Since there are already two, what’s one more?”

Frostfall sensed the situation was turning against him and immediately became obedient, clasping his hands together, raising them high above his head, and lowered his head, exclaiming, “I am willing to serve as the Ancestor’s companion, dedicating my efforts like a loyal hound!”

Ning Yao rubbed her forehead and turned to ask, “Is this how you behaved in prison?”

Nian Xin shook her head, “It was even worse than this; at least Chen Ping’an was having fun.”

Ning Yao nodded, “Then let him stay.” 

It would be good to ask Frostfall some questions to pass the time. Otherwise, staring at those two travelogues wouldn’t reveal much. One was secretive, while the other was open, with no shortage of beautiful women.

Ah, the world is truly a fair place.

———

On the peak of Zhao Ping, confronting the Shenchao City from afar, a swordsman named Chen Yin had purchased all the inns and taverns on the mountain.

He often drank alone here, enjoying the moonrise and sunset.

Meanwhile, in a place called Taoyed Crossing in the Daqin Dynasty, Zhou Mi was aboard a small black boat, having shaken out a cotton-clad round-faced girl from his sleeve, instructing her to brew tea with peach blossom water.

The ferryboat at Taoyed Crossing was intricately designed, with the bow carved into the shape of a swan’s head, reflecting that the Daqin Dynasty had once been the ancient Ze Kingdom. The people needed swans to suppress the calamities brought by the water dragons. Additionally, on both sides of the central cabin, there were decorative screens, making the spacious cabin suitable for storing numerous books. The rear cabin even had a stove and sleeping quarters, making it ideal for enjoying the scenery while drinking, cooking, eating, playing chess, or playing the zither.

This waterway’s peach blossom water, catfish, and peach blossom fans had long been favorites of the dignitaries of the Daqin Dynasty and the female cultivators from the mountains.

While brewing tea during the crescent moon, Zhou Mi gestured with his hands, effortlessly flipping through a stream of time, as simple as turning the pages of a book.

When the person disguised as Chen Yin appeared at the Taoyed Crossing, Zhou Mi smiled slightly, immersing himself in the moment, standing on the small boat where Chen Yin was, “The Chen Yin of yesteryears” remained oblivious.

Chen Yin was meeting with Du Hanling, the master of the Golden Peak Temple on Tongye Island, a Nascent Soul cultivator who was quite astute.

As the ferryboat docked, Chen Yin did not disembark, while Zhou Mi stood at the back of the boat, hands clasped behind him, using his divination technique to observe Du Hanling and the group accompanying him.

Chen Yin clearly did not expect Du Hanling to be so indiscreet as to bring outsiders here. However, the Nascent Soul cultivator immediately bowed in apology, proactively explaining the circumstances to the envoy from the Guiyou Camp.

In the northern region of Tongye Island, the Qinghu Palace on Tianque Peak and the Golden Peak Temple were both not far from the sect. However, Qinghu Palace had long since relocated to the Old Dragon City in Baoping Island, while Golden Peak Temple had flowed down with the fleeing refugees. Du Hanling had first established a connection through a demon-sword cultivator with the Wuzihou military encampment stationed in the old capital of Nanqi, and then through the Wuzihou encampment’s connections, arranged for this meeting with a cultivator named Chen Yin from the Guiyou Camp at Taoyed Crossing. Du Hanling had a rough understanding of the sixty military encampments in the wild, with the Jiazi Camp at the forefront, as well as several other encampments that attracted attention, such as the Jiashen Camp, which was filled with aspiring sword immortals, with many young cultivators of significant status.

The Guihai Camp was responsible for sea routes, while the Jiyou Camp handled land routes, with a great demon presiding over each, namely the water sorceress Fei Fei and the mountain mover Yuan Shou. 

Then there was the Jiwai Camp, led by the sword immortal Shouchen, which gave rise to one of the top ten young ones, She Yue. The Guiyou Camp, in contrast, was relatively unknown.

Zhou Mi smiled knowingly; it seemed that the people in front of him were all old acquaintances of the Hidden Official.

Not only did Du Hanling’s heart show a ripple, but others also seemed to falter when they saw Chen Yin’s face, failing to hide their surprise. Du Hanling, a seasoned Nascent Soul, quickly regained his composure. Whether or not the person before them was the Chen Ping’an who had once stirred up the Daqin court was of little consequence. These individuals now held high positions in the Daqin Dynasty, including a regent from the Liu family and the last surviving Duke of the Daqin Dynasty. Especially Gao Shizhen, upon seeing Chen Yin, looked terrifyingly gloomy.

Additionally, there was a pair of disciples from the Golden Peak Temple, Shao Yuanran and his master, the Daoist Baizhen, Yin Miaofeng. 

Both master and disciple had once been cultivators in the Dragon Gate realm, unable to ascend to immortality, resulting in their departure from Shenchao City to the borders, monitoring the Yao clan’s cavalry for the Liu family over the past decade in the harsh winds and sands of the frontier. Shao Yuanran, although appearing as a young man of remarkable beauty, was actually near fifty, while his master, Yin Miaofeng, was over two hundred.

There was also an inconspicuous city god from the state capital of the city of Qihe.

With the courtiers, princes, dukes, and mountain cultivators gathered at Taoyed Crossing, they unexpectedly encountered someone they never anticipated: “Chen Ping’an.”

Chen Yin had listened to Du Hanling’s explanation and smiled, “Reuniting with old friends, turning enemies into allies; life is truly unpredictable.”

Then Chen Yin stood at the bow of the boat while the others stood on the shore, beginning to conspire and plot.

Zhou Mi listened attentively.

As for Zhou Mi’s real self, he remained seated in the ferry, accepting a cup of tea from She Yue, smiling, “Brewing tea is just boiling water with tea leaves.”

The round-faced girl didn’t think too much, having first been detained in a sleeve and now alone with Master Wenhai, still entirely unconcerned. After pouring herself a full cup, she casually remarked, “This is just my skill; I guarantee it’s drinkable. If Mr. Zhou isn’t satisfied, just call Chen Yin over; he seems to know everything about Haoran customs.”

At the ferry’s bow, the conversation flowed smoothly.

The young Taoist, unaware of Chen Yin’s true level, who far exceeded his expectations, casually chatted with his master using thought speech, chuckling softly, “Master once said that there are trees in the deep mountains that are a thousand years old, whereas it’s rare for humans to live past a hundred. At most, twenty years, and they’ll grow old and faded. It seems my master was mistaken.”

Yin Miaofeng stroked his beard and laughed, “Indeed, it’s somewhat strange. Perhaps the Daqin treasury contains some secret techniques from the immortal realm that allow Yao Jin to maintain her youthful appearance. If Yao Jin hasn’t been secretly cultivating, I wouldn’t believe it. The Daqin treasury,” 

Just the two estates, the Jinhua Mountain God’s Mansion and the Pine Needle Lake Water God’s Temple, were not to be overlooked. The Liu family of Daqin had established their nation for over two hundred years, collecting countless treasures, but sadly, they were moved to the fifth realm by His Majesty the Emperor. It’s uncertain how much of their fortune remains now.

A sword light shot down like a rainbow, landing at the bow of the ferry.

Zhou Mi smiled, “Being early is not as good as being timely; come sit down and have tea.”

Chen Yin unexpectedly tore off his disguise, revealing his true form, and spoke gravely, “Zhou Mi, what exactly do you want to do?!”

Zhou Mi countered, “Shouldn’t you first ask what I’ve done?” 

———

In the Lotus Root Blessed Land, numerous celestial phenomena arose, emerging like bamboo shoots after the rain. Just the brilliance triggered by dozens of heavenly materials and earthly treasures shone forth in the picturesque landscape, with ancient long-lost swords suddenly soaring into the sky, or a thousand-year-old ancient tree unexpectedly bearing immortal fruits, with ethereal mist enveloping them, rich in auspicious energy, no longer merely abundant in spiritual energy. This was the optimal location for those seeking to ascend in their cultivation.

Amidst the mountains, marshes, lakes, and seas, unique flora and fauna thrived, key to producing a natural divine light, resembling mountain gods, water spirits, and earth deities, only needing to be formally consecrated. Additionally, many temple idols that had enjoyed human incense for centuries, originally mere clay sculptures, now began to form golden bodies and opened their eyes to the human world.

Cui Dongshan unleashed a divine technique that replicated mountains and rivers, spreading it across the ground for those with lower cultivation to see more clearly.

The steward Wei Wenlong’s eyes sparkled with excitement as he quickly calculated in his sleeves.

Chang Ming, the Daoist friend, appeared to be in good spirits, pursing his lips and smiling with his eyes squinted.

Cao Qinglang curiously asked, “Junior Brother?”

Cui Dongshan, having nothing to do, stepped in place, waving his sleeves in the air, and laughed, “You haven’t guessed wrong! The Lotus Root Blessed Land not only entered the ranks of high-quality blessed lands but is also about to hit a bottleneck. There aren’t many blessed lands in history that have reached such a transformation. If I remember correctly, there are only six, all of which are the result of centuries of preparation by many mountain sects, like the Hundred Refinements Blessed Land under the Xuan Yi sect, aimed at generating extra fortunes for the blessed land. Ordinary mountains and hills would never dream of such extravagance.” 

It turned out that aside from the Fallen Mountain’s own efforts and the considerable gifts from outsiders, the Lotus Root Blessed Land had, in less than half an hour, reached a bottleneck after just being promoted to a high-quality blessed land.

Just the pile of Qiu pearls that Madam Qingchuan produced caused the blessed land’s water circulation to surge by fifty percent instantly.

Moreover, during the Ten-Person Contest of the world, the national teacher Zhong Qiu acquired a piece of celestial fortune, a map of the Five Mountains. Initially, Zhong Qiu attempted to destroy it to guard against Yu Zhenyi, but later, following Lu Tai’s advice, he abandoned that thought, leaving it in the care of Cao Qinglang for years. Cao Qinglang asked both Zhong Qiu and Junior Brother, one agreed to take it out, while the other said there were no hidden dangers, which led to the appearance of the Five Mountains without requiring the approval of the four national monarchs. As for the original celestial opportunity, buried with golden books and jade records at the foot of a high mountain, it also had a semblance of the mountains of the Haoran world, though its rank was slightly lower compared to the manifested peaks of the Five Mountains.

A small pond behind the bamboo building of the Fallen Mountain transformed into a massive lake, where a purple-gold lotus flower swayed gracefully, and streams of purple-gold light gradually spilled into the lake, the aura of Dao permeating the water’s surface.
Floating Duckweed Sword Lake is one of the eighteen lakes, along with the peak of the Taihui Sword Sect, both of which have taken root and gradually merged with the world around them. Additionally, there’s a sea of clouds gifted by the founder of the Baiyun lineage at the Paodi Peak, a peach forest presented by the Peach Mountain lineage, a blazing cloud from the Taixia lineage, and a white conch cup gifted by Yuan Lingdian of the Zhixuan Peak. This place, large enough to be considered an island, serves as a natural small dojo.

Pei Qian frowned and said, “When the water is full, it overflows. If it reaches a bottleneck and cannot be broken through, it will lead to trouble.”

Cui Dongshan immediately turned and gave Pei Qian a thumbs up. “Senior Sister has a keen eye and insight!”

Zhou Milin finally found her place, holding her golden shoulder pole and green bamboo staff, clapping her hands quickly but silently. The so-called bottleneck refers to the limits of the blessed land; ultimately, there’s a finite size. Among the seventy-two blessed lands, the Guanyin Lotus blessed land, where the Dao Observing Pavilion used to be, is relatively small.

Once the spiritual energy (Qi) in the human realm of the blessed land exceeds a certain limit, it can lead to disasters. Not only would it affect the physical health and destiny of mortals, but it could also cause various natural and man-made calamities. For instance, excessive water flow might lead to turbulent rivers and floods spanning thousands of miles, or a blazing sun might linger overhead, its brilliance scorching the blessed land for years, leading to droughts that kill all living things, with the moon’s essence thickly descending upon the world, spawning hordes of ghosts and spirits, or mountain and marsh spirits rising in droves, rampaging through the human realm.

As the moon waxes, it wanes—this is the ultimate truth of the Dao. Many who ascend from blessed lands trace their roots back to this principle. These favored children of heaven and earth, blessed by fortune, cannot help but depart. If they forcibly remain in the blessed land, they would either be crushed by the heavenly way as usurpers, losing their essence and returning to the earth, or they would leave accordingly. This explains the historical emergence of various blessed lands, but some might even invite calamity, such as the last executioner from the Sword Qi Great Wall, who broke the heavenly restrictions and attracted the attention of cultivators across the realm, ultimately leading to the destruction of the entire blessed land.

The Jiang family governs the Yunku blessed land, known for its vast territory and numerous inhabitants. Despite spending heavily, it has never reached a bottleneck due to calamities triggered by several cultivation events. In contrast, the Liu family of Aiai Continent manages the Han Su blessed land, which is perhaps the least populated, home only to a large group of jade miners specially cultivated by the Liu family. Occasionally, women from other sects would approach the Liu family to become anonymous jade miners, working for no compensation, as the so-called jade mining entails long-term dealings with snowflake coins, greatly benefiting their cultivation. At the same time, the Liu family possesses the most populated blessed land, the Green Shade blessed land, which is a low-tier blessed land that has never received a single divine coin from the Liu family, housing nearly ninety million people. As soon as anyone achieves a breakthrough in the cave dwelling realm, they are immediately taken away from the Green Shade blessed land. Outsiders only know that it is a requirement set by the two legendary ancestors of the Liu family.

Cui Dongshan, of course, has his backup plan and will not let the blessed land's bottleneck become a hidden danger. In fact, he is one of the few individuals capable of managing blessed lands, and Jiang Shangzhen has long been prepared for this.

Cui Dongshan looked down at a picturesque spot in the human realm, where a willow tree stood, hanging a scroll. He reached out to grasp it, unraveling a golden thread that was entwined around it, and held it before him. With a flick of his fingers, the scroll unfolded in mid-air, revealing a landscape painting that stretched over a hundred yards long.

This was a grand gift from Jiang Shangzhen to the blessed land, purchased from an old ancestor of the White Paper blessed land. It was originally crafted specifically for the Yunku blessed land. Once it takes root, as long as there is enough unoccupied territory within the blessed land to soak in spiritual energy for a hundred years, it will transform into a true landscape. In addition, the majority of the refugees previously confined by Jiang Shangzhen on Tongye Island have now exited the blessed land in Baoping Island, with almost all Qi practitioners having left, leaving behind over two hundred thousand common folk. It is unclear how Jiang Shangzhen managed this, but it likely involved both coercion and incentives; ultimately, they chose to remain in the blessed land, awaiting “Heaven’s” disposition.

These are two acts of genuine benevolence: the landscape painting serves as one, and the two hundred thousand souls of common folk serve as the other. As long as they thrive and flourish here, they can add some color back to a “black and white” blessed land.

Wei Ban sincerely praised, “Compared to Zhou Feng, I am truly ashamed.”

As the leader of the Yuguizong and the head of the Jiang family, Jiang Shangzhen has devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Luo Po Mountain.

When a patron reaches this level, even Cui Dongshan feels inclined to present Zhou Fei with a plaque inscribed with “Benevolence Above the Clouds.”

It seems that whatever Jiang Shangzhen does, as long as he puts his heart into it, it stands out remarkably.

The only instance of “self-interest” is that Jiang Shangzhen reserved a small piece of territory for himself, a section of willow branches, which took root to provide shade—likely for future outings with beautiful companions.

With the newly added landscape painting, the previously stagnated spiritual energy of the blessed land began to circulate naturally once more, flowing toward those “blank” landscapes.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “Zhou Feng is indeed an extraordinary person, rare among mortals.”

Then Zhu Lian turned his gaze to Pei Qian, who looked somewhat puzzled.

Zhu Lian explained, “Zhou Feng and I hit it off right away and exchanged techniques, both on equal footing, but ultimately, he lost to you, and he accepted it wholeheartedly.”

Pei Qian pondered for a moment, muttering, “What does that even mean?”

Zhou Milin gently shook her head, as if greeting Pei Qian. Pei Qian pressed her hand against the girl’s head and softly said, “Don’t listen to the old chef’s nonsense; it’s all unfounded. We of the Bamboo Loft lineage treat everyone sincerely.”

In Pei Qian’s early accounts, she had clearly demarcated several distinct factions, such as herself and Sister Nuan Shu, and of course, Xiao Milin, all belonging to the most direct line of the Bamboo Loft lineage. The Gatekeepers included Zheng Dafu and Yuan Lai, while the Qi Long Lane faction had Shi Rou and her shopkeepers, and there were also the Wandering Dreamers…

Cui Dongshan said, “Next, the task of collecting money and settling accounts will be left to Chang Ming and Mr. Wei. Hongxia, take Yun Zi along to help out. Being in a blessed land without doing any work isn’t right.”

Hongxia softly replied, “I accept the order.”

Chen Lingjun added, “Count me in.”

Cui Dongshan smiled as he looked at the somewhat aloof Chen Lingjun. “So, you want to join in? Should I bring along your cousin as well?”

During this trip to the Northern Julu Continent, Chen Lingjun had traveled back and forth across the continent with extreme caution, but his boldness showed when it came to making friends, as evidenced by the incident involving the head of a chicken and burnt yellow paper. 

Chen Lingjun shrank his neck, took a big step sideways, then took another big step closer, standing next to Nuan Shu, he tentatively said, “Maybe let’s skip it?”

Cui Dongshan ignored this fearless figure from the Luo Po Mountain. First, there was the old boatman who had never lost a fight, then there was “My senior brother is Zheng Juzhong” and “Chen Ping’an is my close friend,” and now there’s Chen Lingjun, who had scolded Ruan Qiong for being shameless, patted Lu Chen’s shoulder twice, and even called the Dragon Slayer his brother. These individuals are all exceptional talents, the kind that are hard to come by.

With such a rare collection of heroes, it’s quite amusing that Luo Po Mountain can claim one of them, even Cui Dongshan finds it interesting.

Cui Dongshan turned to Cao Qinglang and said, “That dragon boat ferry can be brought here for repairs. If you think Liu Chongrun’s place is suitable, you can let her bring some steady disciples to choose two or three mountains for cultivation here. But make sure to clarify in advance—within the next sixty years, apart from the Island Master Liu, the direct disciples shouldn’t wander around casually.”

Cui Dongshan raised his hands, shook the sleeves, and pointed to two locations. “For instance, these two places have abundant water flow and can be given to Liu Chongrun of Zhu Chai Island.”

One is part of the Southern Xun Water Hall, gifted by the spirit source official Shen Lin, and the other is a stream donated by the Long Pavilion Marquis Li Yuan.

That dragon boat ferry, named Fan Mo, had been on the verge of collapse when it returned to the Niujiao Mountain ferry, requiring repairs that would cost more than its original value. Liu Chongrun wanted to buy the ferry, not to use it as a mountain ferry, but as a keepsake to be docked at the Water Hall. Unexpectedly, Luo Po Mountain declined, stating they wanted to restore it to its original condition. Liu Chongrun, with good intentions, wanted to help Luo Po Mountain save on costs, but since Luo Po Mountain didn’t mind, she decided not to push further.

However, in the discussions at Luo Po Mountain’s treasury, for the distant Yunshang City and the nearby Zhu Chai Island, even though both are small celestial families, Luo Po Mountain genuinely values them.

Cao Qinglang nodded, expressing no objections.

For Luo Po Mountain to stand firm during both chaotic and peaceful times and to establish a lasting legacy, it must form alliances with major sects for mutual benefit while also helping smaller celestial families like Zhu Chai Island, Yunshang City, and Cai Que Mansion grow alongside it. Moreover, it is essential not to engage solely for profit; Luo Po Mountain must earn money, garner incense, and win the hearts of the people!

Cui Dongshan said, “Today, I’m being more hands-on than usual. From now on, you will be the one in charge of this Lotus Root blessed land. Feel free to discuss things with others if you wish, or take the liberty to act on your own if you prefer. Since Mr. Wei trusts you, I trust you as well, so don’t mind my thoughts; we are peers after all. Just don’t let Mr. Wei down.”

Cao Qinglang and his junior brother bowed in gratitude, though his mood was not light.

Cui Dongshan suddenly smiled at Zhu Lian and asked, “I’ve been quite remarkable today; the old chef wouldn’t be displeased, would he?”

Zhu Lian smiled, “Those who can do more should work more. If one makes more mistakes, no one blames them. Moreover, you, young Mr. Cui, do more right than wrong.”

Cui Dongshan withdrew his gaze, looking down at the human realm. “After continuously pouring money, we can finally start earning! Fortune is turning, a good omen, a great omen!”

Every top-tier blessed land that reaches a bottleneck is truly a treasure trove overflowing with wealth. The “Heavenly” sects and noble families that hold these blessed lands can freely extract the heavenly materials and treasures that emerge from them.

Local cultivators in the blessed lands can also break free from their confines and be taken away, becoming the ancestral halls and celestial masters of “heavenly” immortal estates. This is what many blessed land texts refer to as “ascension and ranking among the immortals.”

This is how blessed land holders use the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, or rather, genuine divine coins, to exchange for real immortals.

Moreover, this practice neither harms the Dao nor disrupts the natural balance of the land or the harmony among people.

Finally, Zhu Lian pulled Wei Shanjun, who had nothing to do and preferred to relax and enjoy the scenery, to continue overseeing the grand painting, while Chang Ming and the treasury manager Wei Wenlong began their journeys to collect wealth.

Cui Dongshan left the blessed land with Pei Qian, the old sword immortal Mi, and the somewhat expendable Hongxia.

Cao Qinglang quietly made his way toward the capital of the South Yuan Kingdom.

Tongsheng, Xiucai, Juren, Zhuangyuan—these were all titles Cao Qinglang had earned.

In the past, he had participated in the imperial examination of the South Yuan Kingdom, progressing like a hot knife through butter. He became the top scholar in the provincial examination, then in the national examination, and finally achieved the title of Zhuangyuan, becoming the first person in the history of the Lotus Root blessed land to attain a triple triumph.

Even the teacher who planted the seeds in autumn couldn’t help but be both amused and baffled, as this series of titles were all earned by Cao Qinglang’s own merit.

So when Cao Qinglang later left, he became a major unsolved case in the capital’s official circles.

During his time at the Li Ji Academy in the Central Continent, when he encountered the revered sage of the literary path, the old scholar, who had heard about this from the seed planter, was overjoyed. He almost burned three sticks of incense right then, exclaiming that this was remarkable, a true case of “blue rising above blue.” Our literary lineage is soaring, whether in studying, playing chess, drinking, practicing swords, writing, or martial arts—none can rival them, and now even the one blemish in terms of titles has been lifted!

Cui Dongshan stayed at Luo Po Mountain, while Hongxia followed closely beside him.

Pei Qian and Mi Yu set out on foot to the Niujiao Mountain ferry, one heading south and the other north. Pei Qian planned to take a ferry to the battlefield in the Southern Yue territory, while Mi Yu would make a trip to the Cai Que Mansion in the Northern Julu Continent.

Reaching the increasingly prosperous Niujiao Mountain ferry, once a legitimate celestial family mountain called the Bao Fu Zhai, with buildings sprawling across a vast area, including pavilions and markets.

In the past, Bao Fu Zhai misjudged the situation, overlooking the Southern expedition of the Great Li Iron Cavalry, effectively selling part of their land to the Pi Yun Mountain and Luo Po Mountain. Afterward, Bao Fu Zhai regretted their decision, wanting to buy it back at a high price. Wei Ban happened to host a night banquet for Bao Fu Zhai’s distinguished guests, and after that, there were no further discussions.

Mi Yu would later have Wei Shanjun help deliver him to the border of the Northern Yue, after which he planned to conceal his aura and travel alone across the continent, conveniently visiting the long bridge connecting the two continents. Meanwhile, Pei Qian, on this journey, did not carry her mountain staff or bamboo box, leaving her narrow sword and talisman behind at Luo Po Mountain. Instead, she wore a jade plaque from the Great Li Execution Department and had two stacked swords hung at her waist, planning to take a Great Li border guard ferry south, disguised as Zheng Qian.

Pei Qian intended to suppress her cultivation to the Golden Body realm, adopting an Aiai Continent accent and a fist technique similar to that of the Lei Gong Temple lineage from the Ma Hu Prefecture.

Mi Yu said to Pei Qian, “Be careful.”

Pei Qian nodded, “You too, Mi Sword Immortal.”

Mi Yu felt helpless. 

Now, whenever he hears the term “Sword Immortal,” he feels uncomfortable all over.

By the stone table on the cliffside, Cui Dongshan reclined with one leg crossed over the other, casually casting spells, the stone table painting displaying the figures of Senior Sister and the old sword immortal Mi, as the white-clad youth leisurely munched on seeds, while Hongxia didn’t dare to sit down.

Cui Dongshan glanced at this Yuan Ying water dragon. “Do I need to kneel and beg you to move so I can invite Lord Yun Zi here?”

Hongxia quickly performed a deep bow and flew off to the Hui Meng Mountain.

On the way back to Luo Po Mountain after leaving the blessed land, Hongxia still didn’t dare to speak. In truth, she had her eyes on a river located in a remote area within the Pine Blowing Kingdom. Compared to the site selected by Pei Xiang in the Fox Kingdom, this one was far inferior, as the latter was based on a dragon vein, albeit a hidden one.

As a Yuan Ying water dragon, if the Lotus Root blessed land were merely a mid-tier blessed land or just barely qualified as a top-tier one, Hongxia should not practice within it, as she would siphon too much local spiritual energy and fortune. Now, however, it would not be a problem, and Cui Dongshan could see through Hongxia’s thoughts without making things difficult for her. Currently, the blessed land’s water flow is so rich that it’s astonishing; if left unchecked, the absence of water spirits and water creatures feeding on the spiritual energy within their small realms could be quite problematic.

That’s why Cui Dongshan instructed Hongxia to bring along the Golden Core realm Yun Zi to avoid wasting time rolling around in the muddy slopes of Hui Meng Mountain, which could lead passing celestial masters to mistakenly believe that Luo Po Mountain is a den of thieves involved in dubious dealings.

Initially, the Lotus Root blessed land was divided into four parts by the old observer; besides South Yuan’s area that seemed colorful, the remaining territory resembled a black-and-white sketch.

Cui Dongshan knew very well that this was a hefty gift from the old Daoist, meant for the embroidered tiger to “patch the Dao.” However, he had no intention of accepting such a gift.

Cui Dongshan softly remarked, “Let’s see how the old chef unfolds this puzzle.”

Over at the blessed land, the long-lived friend was quite observant, discovering an intriguing presence that had previously escaped even the landscape painting of the immortal mountain. This was a slender woman, ethereal and barely noticeable, born from the convergence of literary elegance and the manifestation of the Dao. At that moment, she was in a scholarly family’s library in a city beneath her feet, secretly flipping through books. Although she might not amount to much at the moment, with a bit of nurturing, she could be a valuable asset for the blessed land.

Wei Wenlong was overjoyed, communicating in his heart with the long-lived companion, “Such a rare existence that emerges with fortune is worth its weight in gold. Among the seventy-two blessed lands, only seventeen are documented.”

The long-lived friend replied, “The master wouldn’t agree to it.”

In reality, she wouldn’t either.
As the manifestation of the ancestral coin of gold and bronze, Changming shared a natural kinship with this woman of literary fortune. It was akin to how Changming never concealed her fondness for Nuan Shu when they were at the Ruined Peak (Luopo Mountain).

"Wei Wendong," he chuckled, "it seems your understanding of the rules has gone awry."

Changming smiled but said nothing. In truth, she hadn’t misinterpreted anything. Otherwise, you, Wei, would have to watch your step lest you trip over your own coins.

Chen Lingjun sat cross-legged in mid-air, riding the wind as he followed behind the two. Without the presence of that large white goose, he felt more at ease, even adopting an old and grumpy tone. "Sister Changming, are there any alchemists in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land nowadays? Sigh, even if there are, they’ve all surpassed my generation."

Changming casually replied, "At most, in another thirty years, we might see five or six alchemists."

As practitioners made their way up the mountain, forming their golden body from the spirits of the mountains and waters, the heroic spirits and mountain spirits would all rush toward the Dao, each with their own fortune. However, even if someone were to achieve the golden core first, there wouldn’t be any extra fortune to bestow upon them. This was because the very first true practitioner in the history of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Yu Zhenyi of the Lake Mountain Sect, had attained the golden core long before the land was divided into four. This individual, situated in a lowly blessed land, managed to continuously break through and ascend to the realm of golden core earth immortals, making him a true genius among geniuses. Thus, even if a new golden core appeared in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, they could quietly enjoy their fortune behind closed doors, but boasting about it would be unnecessary.

According to the tales from Ruined Peak regarding "Zhou Fei," Yu Zhenyi was considered shameless for climbing the mountain to cultivate immortality while coming down to bully those practicing martial arts. Was such bullying acceptable?

Suddenly, Chen Lingjun slapped his forehead, "I need to take a trip to the Fox Kingdom to scout for my good brother. Sister Changming, Wei, I’m off!"

Without waiting for a response, Chen Lingjun set off, truly intending to explore the Fox Kingdom. He could perform illusion techniques too; after all, his Nascent Soul was not just for show.

He intended to see if he could help his newly acquainted friend, Chen Zhuoliu, find a wife.

Yunxia Mountain, the Fox Kingdom, and the Changchun Palace north of the capital of Dali were all renowned for their abundance of female cultivators. Particularly, the Fox Kingdom, which had long been run with heavy investments by the Xu family of the former Qingfeng City, was famous for being a gentle haven for heroes.

However, after Pei Xiang utilized her powers to relocate from Qingfeng City to Ruined Peak, the two realms became separated, taking root in the blessed land. The restrictions imposed by the financially obsessed Wei Dashanjun further complicated matters, leaving foreign travelers and those cultivating there stumbling around like headless flies. It took considerable effort to finally calm the chaos in the Fox Kingdom. Those enchanting fox spirits were infatuated and skilled at whispering sweet nothings; which hero could withstand that?

As someone who had first introduced the young mountain lord to the illusion of flowers in the mirror and the moon on the water, Chen Lingjun was quite familiar with the various factions and mountains of the Fox Kingdom.

In the Fox Kingdom, there was one mountain and one temple, rich in literary heritage. Historically, many impoverished scholars who detoured to burn incense here found great success and achieved fame. Chen Lingjun planned to bring Chen Zhuoliu along to burn incense in the future, hoping to change his somewhat dubious name "Zhuoliu" to "Qingliu," as it would be more auspicious. After all, being recognized as a member of the Qingliu in Dali’s officialdom was quite valuable. As for how to help his brother gain a local student identity before seeking help from Wei Dashanjun, he had it all figured out. He would find a dark, windy night when few people were around and secretly seek out Wei Dashanjun at the Piyun Mountain, ready to negotiate.

This was perhaps what Chen Lingjun had always yearned for in his heart—"to roam the rivers and lakes with righteousness at the forefront." Even after becoming a Nascent Soul water dragon, his bad habit of putting on a brave face for his friends would be hard to change.

His good brother, Chen Zhuoliu, had many good qualities but lacked money. Yet, he was extravagantly generous, more willing to put on a brave face than Chen Lingjun himself; the only thing he couldn’t let go of was his unfulfilled dream of becoming an official. He often indulged in literary pretensions, lamenting about great guests at banquets and drunkenly reminiscing about the past.

"Listen to him! He's clearly an impoverished scholar still obsessed with the examination system," Chen Lingjun thought. How could he not help?

Zhu Lian, on a whim, left only Wei Dashanjun behind at the Tianmu and took Pei Xiang along with Chen Nuan Shu and Zhou Mili to the Fox Kingdom.

Pei Xiang used her illusion technique, landing them in a private garden belonging to her, known as the "Peach Blossom Grove."

In ancient Shu, there were many dragons, and among the ancient Yue, the women were the most affectionate. But in this world of romance, who could compare to the fox spirits?

In a scenic pavilion, a snow-white bamboo mat was laid out. Pei Xiang, dressed in a fitted brocade robe with a layer of bamboo silk over it, was kneeling on the ground. Zhou Mili imitated her but felt awkward and settled for sitting cross-legged like the old chef.

After obtaining Pei Xiang’s consent, Chen Nuan Shu began to brew tea nearby, setting up the tea utensils. The bamboo stove boiled, and the fragrant steam wafted through the air, mingling with the delicate fabric of Zhou Mili’s skirt.

Zhou Mili stole a glance at the old chef, holding a cup in one hand while feigning expertise. She took a sip but accidentally gulped too much, quickly spitting most of it back out. Nodding her head, she pretended to be knowledgeable, saying, "Delicious."

Feeling that her response was too short and failed to show off her sophistication, Zhou Mili hurriedly added, "Extremely good!"

Chen Nuan Shu smiled gently at her.

Zhu Lian reached out to ruffle the little girl’s hair, to which Zhou Mili tilted her head, complaining, "What’s this? My height is being lowered because of you! I used to be too easygoing, so from now on, unless it’s you, the good-natured mountain lord, no one else can hinder my growth; I’ll be fierce with them!"

Zhu Lian laughed heartily.

Pei Xiang, however, wore a sullen expression, ignoring the playful antics of the chief steward and the right protector. The Fox Kingdom’s ruler, who should have been overjoyed, felt a pang of sadness and turned her gaze outside the pavilion, her expression lost in thought.

Zhu Lian merely smiled and sipped his tea.

Pei Xiang withdrew her gaze and softly called, "Yan Fang."

Zhu Lian smiled and replied, "Drinking wine requires a heroic spirit, but drinking tea should be done with a tranquil heart."

Pei Xiang retorted, "Easier said than done!"

Zhu Lian asked, "Then do you think Mili is light-hearted or not?"

Zhou Mili straightened her back at once. Although she completely didn’t understand the conversation between the old chef and Sister Pei Xiang, she was about to frown but quickly smoothed her brow.

Pei Xiang sighed in resignation, "Mili can remain undistracted, but I am the ruler of the Fox Kingdom, born a fox spirit, and have been stained by worldly matters for so many years. How can I maintain a tranquil heart? Yan Fang, don’t make it hard for me."

Zhu Lian nodded, smiling, "With the sword immortal on the left, the Fire Dragon of North Julu on the right, Mrs. Qingzhong of Luoshui Pit, Liu Jinglong of the Taihui Sword Sect, Li Cai of the Floating Duck Lake, Shen Lin of the Qidu Spirit Source, Li Yuan the Dragon Pavilion Marquis, and Jiang Shangzhen, the leader of the Yu Gui Sect from Tongye Island, even Pei Qian is at the peak of the martial realm, not to mention the old master of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, the former head of the East Sea Daoist Temple, a grandmaster of the fourteenth realm... Pei Xiang, if you’re not terrified by this lineup, then you’re already quite at peace."

Pei Xiang’s face turned pale, her breath unsteady, as she gently pressed her palm against the mat.

Zhou Mili was about to speak, glancing at the old chef for help, but noticed Nuan Shu giving her a subtle shake of the head. Mili quickly fell silent and resumed sipping her tea. She understood; the old chef was discussing matters of great importance with Pei Xiang.

Chen Nuan Shu handed Pei Xiang a cup of tea.

Pei Xiang accepted the cup, asking Zhu Lian, "Did Ruined Peak already know why I chose that dragon vein?"

Initially, she thought Ruined Peak wouldn’t think too much of it, merely viewing her as someone who had chosen a feng shui treasure that was rich in fortune for the Fox Kingdom. But now that Pei Xiang was aware of Ruined Peak's true depth, she realized her little schemes and machinations were akin to a naive child speaking of sage principles—ridiculously laughable.

Ruined Peak was too hidden and subtle, operating a lowly blessed land for only a few years, layer upon layer, tightly interlinked without a flaw, instantaneously elevating a mid-tier blessed land to the bottleneck of a high-tier blessed land. Where did all that divine money come from? How did so many peak connections and incense offerings arise? It was as if the blessings of the immortals fell like rain upon the blessed land.

Zhu Lian nodded, "The Fox Kingdom secretly gathered quite a bit of literary fortune for the Xu family of Qingfeng City, and the Xu family married their legitimate daughter to the illegitimate son of the Upper Pillar State's Yuan family. I suspect they are likely twins—a boy to support the dragon and a girl to climb the dragon. Of course, Xu Huan wouldn’t dare to meddle in the national fortune; competing with the embroidered tiger is pure folly. But this sort of icing on the cake, even if the Song family of Dali knew about it, would surely welcome it. The literary fortune would still remain within the Dali dynasty; if it lands with the Song family, even better. You actually have little burden in this matter; it’s genuinely a small affair in the Ruined Peak’s accounts."

Pei Xiang felt her mind go blank as she could only stare at Zhu Lian, who she had thought was within her reach, but now realized he was still far away.

Zhou Mili heard this but didn’t remember it, likely to forget it soon. Listening was part of the right protector's duty, but she couldn’t retain it because her standards were too high, and her heart was broader than a table.

Zhu Lian collected his smile and set down his teacup. "Pei Xiang, now that you’re here at Ruined Peak, you must abide by the customs and treat people with sincerity."

He pointed to himself, "For example, I can understand your wariness, which is why I’ve been waiting for you to open up and reveal the secrets yourself. But you haven’t."

He pointed at Pei Xiang, "You’ve reached this point, and yet I’ve had to help you reveal it twice. Here at Ruined Peak, we have an unwritten rule: ‘No matter the issue, it shouldn’t exceed three times.’"

Pei Xiang had a puzzled look on her face, furrowing her brows tightly before shaking her head to indicate she didn’t understand.

Zhu Lian smiled, "Nuan Shu, Mili, you two leave for a moment."

The two girls immediately excused themselves, departing without hesitation.

Zhu Lian slowly rose, his figure slightly hunched, his fists still appearing loose, smiling as he said, "Before he left, that little scholar Cui mentioned that the Fox Kingdom hides a small mystery he wants to test me on, to see if I can solve it."

Pei Xiang lifted her head, fox tails appearing behind her as a form of self-protection. Although this small world belonged to her, she shouldn’t forget who truly reigned over this blessed land.

Zhu Lian said, "Pei Xiang, I give you one last chance; otherwise, the ruler of the Fox Kingdom will change. Don’t worry; we of Ruined Peak will never burn the bridge after crossing it. Not only will you not die, but you can also continue your cultivation in peace, and the fortunes of the Fox Kingdom will continue to rise. However, if you bring upon your own misfortune, don’t blame me for being heavy-handed."

Pei Xiang’s eyes turned red, biting her lip until blood seeped out. Unaware of her own condition, she felt utterly aggrieved and asked, "Zhu Lian, what exactly do you want me to say to you, but what can I possibly say?"

Zhu Lian revealed the truth, "The true puppet master behind the Fox Kingdom and Qingfeng City! Is there a connection with the Patriarch Hall of Zhengyang Mountain?!"

Pei Xiang collapsed to the ground.

But just as her thoughts stirred, her mind trembled, rendering her completely unable to speak, writhing in pain, and her suffering was genuine.

She hugged her head, desperately trying to stabilize her Dao heart and soul, raising her gaze to Zhu Lian, her eyes a mix of complex emotions—reluctance, guilt, regret, self-reproach...

Suddenly, a young man in white appeared in the pavilion, his fingers lightly tapping Pei Xiang's forehead.

Turning his back to Zhu Lian, the young man chuckled, "Old chef, you really don’t hold back, do you? You should learn from my master."

Pei Xiang felt an immense weight lift off her shoulders, as if she had been granted amnesty. Even a Nascent Soul might find themselves drenched in sweat. She sat back down in the pavilion, like a schoolchild caught misbehaving, suddenly needing to face the punishment from two teachers.

Cui Dongshan cast a soul-binding technique on Pei Xiang, which was more sophisticated than the typical immobilization techniques used by mountain immortals. It wasn’t a method to seal the Qi of a practitioner but specifically aimed at suppressing the thoughts of a Nascent Soul fox spirit, preventing the hidden puppet master thousands of miles away from tracing the truth.

Cui Dongshan turned and smiled, "Old chef, you were just a hair’s breadth away from startling the snake in the grass."

Zhu Lian chuckled, "Is the riddle half-solved?"

Cui Dongshan nodded, "No wonder the old chef can whip up such a great spread."

Luring the Fox Kingdom into Ruined Peak, isolating it in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, was indeed a reckless maneuver, a method that was excessively underhanded. Yet it was undeniably divine, having cut off half of Qingfeng City’s financial resources. But if Zhu Lian became complacent and remained oblivious to the real dangers, in the long term, this would be the key to their victory or defeat. Ruined Peak seemed to gain significantly but had been concealing its shortcomings for many years, yet voluntarily handed a crucial opportunity to its opponent. It could lose more than just an upper-tier bottleneck blessed land; it might very well shake the foundations of Ruined Peak, leaving Cao Qinglang in deep guilt about his hometown and disappointment in himself. A sage of culture and a martial master planting seeds in the autumn would become dejected, while Pei Qian, who couldn't let go of a heart-relating temple, would be furious. Pei Qian’s state of mind would also influence Nuan Shu and Mili... Ruined Peak would gradually crumble from within.

"Thinking of running?" 

Cui Dongshan turned to a specific direction, reaching out to grasp something from the void at the edge of the Fox Kingdom. He solidified a fragment of soul thought into a piece, gently crushing it between his fingers, then pressed it back to Pei Xiang's forehead with force, restoring it to its original state with slight modifications. "What a joke, daring to play with that mental power under my nose, go back quietly!"

Cui Dongshan finally bent his fingers, lightly tapping Pei Xiang's forehead again.

Zhu Lian fell silent.

No wonder people envy immortals; their techniques and powers are diverse and profound.

The hidden puppet master who had restricted Pei Xiang’s thoughts was no ordinary individual. Cui Dongshan’s ability to retrieve an elusive thought from afar and return it to Pei Xiang showcased an immortal's prowess.

Suddenly, Zhu Lian focused his voice, speaking to Cui Dongshan, "Gu Can sent a secret letter to Piyun Mountain, entrusted to Wei Ban for delivery to Ruined Peak. He mentioned that the person next to him, Chai Boshu, was tied to the Xu family of Qingfeng City through the women, and that Chai Boshu was aware that his junior sister had her own hidden legacy. However, he did not know who it was. Thus, I suspect that the Xu family woman and Pei Xiang are both pawns of the same individual, with neither party aware of this. The puppet master has allowed their internal strife to continue for years, serving as a layer of obfuscation."

Cui Dongshan smiled but didn’t respond.

Zhu Lian continued, "The human heart is like water; thus, to connect with others is to walk through water. It could be a small stream, clear and visible, or a mighty river, murky and chaotic, or a deep ancient well, unfathomable. A single misstep could lead to drowning."

Cui Dongshan sighed, raising his hand to wipe his face with his sleeve. "There are some things I know but cannot speak of, nor can I act upon. Old chef, your culinary skills are excellent, so please bear with me. Otherwise, what should be a clearly defined matter will become muddled. Once the water gets murky, it’s hard to see the lurking fish."

From Zhu Lian to Zheng Dafeng, and then to Wei Ban, the three shared a tacit understanding about a matter—trusting Cui Dongshan to handle it while being cautious of his true intentions.

Cui Dongshan was well aware of this, feeling no discomfort whatsoever.

In fact, he firmly believed that a mountain faction should operate this way; it was only right.

Everyone could be good people, espousing moral virtues, or everyone could be self-serving scoundrels, harboring deeper schemes than any immortal, but both extremes were flawed.

Cui Dongshan gazed out at the mountains and waters beyond the pavilion, murmuring, "Where does the wind rise, and where does the snow fall?"

Zhu Lian casually replied, "In the Hibiscus Mountain?"

Within the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, there was indeed a Hibiscus Mountain, renowned alongside Bird's Eye Peak, Spring Tide Palace, and Lake Mountain Sect as one of the four great places to admire clouds and snow.

Cui Dongshan sighed, "I was watching that direction for quite some time, but there hasn’t been a single sign. Old chef, do you think people worry?"

————

In the fifth realm, at the quiet mountains bordering the Xianzhang Sect and the Bingjie Mountain forces, a wild cultivator without any official status in the Qingming realm found another kindred spirit without a formal identity. 

A young man, dressed in a scholar’s robe, appeared.
In a realm known as the Jade Purity (Yupujing), a young man named Yu Zhenyi, whose appearance resembled that of a child, quietly stepped into this new world from the vast expanse known as the Haoran World. Having first traveled through the Qingming World, he now found himself in this place.

A young scholar located Yu Zhenyi, who was currently sitting cross-legged on a long sword, breathing slowly and deeply. White wisps resembling four snakes hung from his nostrils and ears. Opening his eyes, Yu Zhenyi inquired, “Fellow Daoist, what brings you to the mountains?”

The scholar, who had dared to don a Confucian robe while wandering alone in this Daoist territory, seemed out of place. Although he appeared to possess the aura of a mere Longmen Realm cultivator, he had managed to break through numerous mountain and water prohibitions to find Yu Zhenyi, which was even more unreasonable.

The scholar chuckled and replied, “Fellow Daoist? Just call me Zheng Huan. We are actually from the same hometown, so there's no need for formality.”

Yu Zhenyi’s expression remained calm as he said, “Please leave quickly.”

Zheng Huan, the self-proclaimed scholar, mischievously asked, “And what if I don't? Are you afraid of a fight? What if blood spills everywhere and taints this clear water and soil?”

Yu Zhenyi fell silent, carefully assessing this audacious stranger. 

In the past, due to a young fallen immortal, significant changes had occurred in the blessed land. With Ding Ying's death, Yu Zhenyi seized the opportunity to rise, eventually becoming the undisputed number one in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. After that, he ceased to concern himself with worldly matters, focusing solely on ascending and cultivating, keeping an eye on the world. The only person he regarded as a rival was the new leader of the Demon Sect, Lu Tai. 

As for the martial artist, Zhong Qiu, who had drifted further away from him, it was merely that Yu Zhenyi had no time to trouble the Southern Garden Kingdom. After achieving a golden elixir, he entered closed-door training three times, with Lu Tai interrupting him twice. The final time, he successfully ascended to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, but by then, the land had undergone tremendous changes. Yu Zhenyi was even less inclined to pay attention to the Southern Garden Kingdom, let alone figures like Tang Tieyi and Cheng Yuanshan, who were not worth his concern.

During Yu Zhenyi's last closed-door training, an unknown young martial artist emerged in the world. He wielded a sword but was not a sword cultivator. After spending several years in the mountains practicing swordsmanship, Yu Zhenyi broke through to the Nascent Soul stage just as the young man descended the mountain with his sword.

The young man’s first battle, fresh from obscurity, was to challenge the entire Lake Mountain Sect. However, all these events were merely past matters for Yu Zhenyi; he did not care about the honor or disgrace of Lake Mountain Sect.

Rising from his seated position, Yu Zhenyi decided to leave directly on his sword. “Since you’re here, I shall take my leave.”

Zheng Huan, ever persistent, smiled and said, “Where do you think you can go? I merely came to observe one of the old master’s techniques, and it’s not aimed at you, Yu Zhenyi. My true purpose is to see a certain disciple of yours, the fallen immortal Lu Tai, or Lu Tai if you prefer. His ambitions are grand, but his accomplishments are limited. I’m worried that I might run into an unworthy descendant, and with you here, I can have a chat and warm up the atmosphere.”

Yu Zhenyi had already landed on the ground, bowing deeply and remaining bent over, reluctant to rise, not even daring to utter a word.

Zheng Huan, the scholar, was one of the five manifestations of the White Jade Capital's three masters. His essence was far more profound than the out-of-body experiences of ordinary cultivators, making him an enigmatic figure. 

Now, this Zheng Huan could be considered a being without boundaries. Yu Zhenyi harbored a deep aversion towards fallen immortals, so his understanding of the Tongye Continent and the Haoran World was not superficial. However, upon hearing the name Zheng Huan, Yu Zhenyi could not connect the dots, for he did not believe he was worthy of a master from the White Jade Capital seeking him out.

“In this humble blessed land, you, sir, are one in ten thousand. There’s no need to think about possibilities; it’s just a habit you must change. Otherwise, the higher you stand, the faster you’ll fall.”

Zheng Huan, one of Lu Chen's incarnations, merely chuckled, raised his hand, and conjured a lotus crown out of thin air, placing it atop his head. “It doesn’t suit me now. Why not let you wear it for a while?”

Yu Zhenyi bent even lower, whispering, “I dare not.”

Lu Chen replied, “A simple bow is enough. The Daoist tradition has passed down this courtesy; it’s not a method that weakens the knees of future practitioners. Yu Zhenyi, the higher your realm, the more you fear death. No wonder the old master looks down on you. Just at the Nascent Soul stage, he wants you to roll out of the way to make room for others. It doesn’t matter; the old master may not think highly of you, but I believe you have potential. I’ll provide you with an opportunity that’s just right for you.”

Yu Zhenyi stayed silent, striving to keep his heart calm as he practiced the simple technique of firmly remembering that Zheng Huan was Lu Chen, and quickly forgetting all other words.

Seeing that Yu Zhenyi’s response was reasonable, Lu Chen did not continue to pressure the young cultivator who had worked hard to reach the Jade Purity stage. Instead, he brought Yu Zhenyi down the mountain for a journey towards a place near the center of the world.

Yu Zhenyi felt a surge of emotions. It was said that Lu Chen had experienced five dreams, each representing different aspects of his journey, including a dream of a Confucian teacher, a dream of a skull pillow, a dream of an oak tree coming to life, a dream of a spirit turtle dying, and a dream of transforming into a butterfly, leaving the question of who was who.

This led to countless interpretations in later generations.

Before Yu Zhenyi acquired a pass to leave the Qingming World, the old master merely instructed him to immerse himself in cultivation in the fifth realm and adapt to circumstances. However, on the way to the great gate, Yu Zhenyi had perused numerous texts from various Daoist lineages, including many analyses of the Dao from the three masters of the White Jade Capital. The common theme among them was the notion of Lu Chen's carefree journey on the virtual boat.

One particular Daoist text from the Great Xuandu Temple described Lu Chen as someone who was never seen as the true person by anyone. To Yu Zhenyi, this was akin to the Buddhist saying that perceiving the Tathagata is not perceiving the Tathagata. It was yet another vague expression typical of Daoism, which left Yu Zhenyi feeling quite helpless.

As he followed the scholar Zheng Huan, or rather, the master Lu Chen, through the shrinking mountains and rivers towards the center of the world, Yu Zhenyi felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness.

Not daring to ride his sword, he merely followed Lu Chen on the wind, afraid of inadvertently displaying great disrespect. The three masters of the White Jade Capital were renowned; the Grand Master was praised for his natural approach to Dao, the second master was indeed invincible, while Lu Chen was said to embody the most unpredictable nature of heaven. According to the Great Xuandu Temple, which traditionally disliked giving any credit to the White Jade Capital, whatever Lu Chen had in mind, even he himself was often unaware.

One day, Lu Chen finally halted, extending a finger to draw a simple barrier-breaking talisman, which revealed a great gate before them. Turning with a smile, he said, “We’re about to return home. After all this circling around, we can finally reunite. Are you happy?”

Yu Zhenyi replied, “I have no attachments to home.”

Lu Chen shook his head, his gaze filled with pity. “The further one is from home, the less one knows.”

Yu Zhenyi sincerely replied, “I’ve learned a lesson.”

Not venturing out of doors to know the world, not peering through windows to see the Dao. 

Lu Chen led Yu Zhenyi into this blessed land, where no one had yet “ascended.” Suddenly, he swept an arm across, his hand striking Yu Zhenyi’s face, causing a brilliant talisman to appear and vanish in an instant. This left the Jade Purity cultivator gasping for breath, as though he had plunged into the Cave Dwelling realm. Yu Zhenyi stumbled, struggling to find his footing, as several of his innate energy gates closed tightly. Moreover, upon slightly inspecting his inner consciousness, he was horrified to find that the spiritual energy within his small cosmic realm had thickened into water and crystallized like gold and jade, falling to the ground. This made Yu Zhenyi feel as if he were a frail child carrying a heavy log, struggling to walk uphill.

The door behind them closed on its own as Lu Chen continued forward, lazily remarking, “The old master is indeed protective; he sent me a blessed land of only moderate quality. You, a Jade Purity cultivator, moving through here would easily attract heavenly phenomena, wouldn’t that stir up great waves? It’s just the two of us; who are you scaring? Quickly adapt to the Cave Dwelling realm. If you act like a worldly commoner, transitioning from luxury to poverty will be difficult. What sort of cultivator would you then be?”

Yu Zhenyi immediately began to stabilize his Dao heart, following behind Lu Chen.

Lu Chen asked, “Do you know why the sages prefer water over mountains?”

Yu Zhenyi shook his head. “I humbly ask the master for clarification.”

Lu Chen explained, “Buddhists see a bowl of water containing forty-eight thousand insects. Confucius sighed by the water, lamenting how time flows ceaselessly day and night. My master used to say that water is akin to the Dao, omnipresent. Why? Look, when it comes to water, the founders of the three teachings are all quite amicable, not quarreling at all. Now look back at what they say: ‘Ritual is the root of chaos.’ The debates among the three teachings, are they not frightening? Do you know that before the three teachings debated, the Qingming World had already been filled with various doctrines and practices from the Western Buddhist countries?”

Yu Zhenyi, having left the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, had made it a point to read as many Daoist texts from the Qingming World as possible, and thus he was aware of this matter. “Seventeen debates, and the Qingming World lost them all. Those seventeen real people were all shaved and became monks, ultimately known as the ‘Wuwu Seventeen Monks.’”

Lu Chen revealed a secret: “In the early years, the heavenly court had five highest authorities. Among them, the Jianghu overlord, aside from overseeing the rivers and lakes, truly governed the river of time. Each time a deity perished, their remains would transform into stars beyond the heavens, with their divine essence merging into time and gathering into a river. The souls of our human race actually emerged from this water. Thus, among all beings in the world, only humans possess bodies closest to deities. Once they cultivate, they ascend rapidly, leaving the older demon races, who have a longer history, envious and eager to consume them, literally devouring them. In truth, no matter how much they consume, they still end up with nothing, meaning what? Even if they manage to digest half a ‘one,’ what of it?”

While walking slowly through the forest, Lu Chen did not ride the wind but spoke leisurely, “When I first arrived in the Qingming World, I wasn’t in a hurry to go to the White Jade Capital. I merely collected Buddhist verses in my spare time, which were splendidly composed, both dazzling and resplendent. I personally witnessed most of the remaining temples in the Qingming World, and I once heard an old monk sing: ‘Flowers fall and water flows away, the world is empty and silent.’ He then cast down his whisk and left, what a profound cycle of life and death, devoid of existence and non-existence.”

At this point, Lu Chen turned to look at the youthful Yu Zhenyi and chuckled, “Now look at you, can you compare? Is the difference in our Dao hearts merely a matter of attainment?”

Yu Zhenyi humbly accepted the lesson, carefully pondering its meaning. 

Looking at the scholar Zheng Huan before him, he felt that the other exuded a rustic Daoist aura, akin to the clear moonlight and gentle breeze, ultimately illuminating the surroundings.

Lu Chen vigorously waved his sleeve, producing a crisp sound. 

At this moment in the blessed land, it was roughly the season of light snow, with the ground not yet severe in cold.

Yu Zhenyi cautiously asked, “Master Lu, are we heading to Furong Mountain?”

The youthful-looking Yu Zhenyi, reluctant to ride his sword, could only carry his sword on his back. Although he was short, the long sword made him appear quite comical. 

If he had slung the sword at an angle, it wouldn’t have seemed too bad, but this temporary master, who had taken the name “Zheng Huan,” insisted on helping him carry it upright behind him. 

If he couldn’t even carry a sword properly, how could his heart be right? Without a right heart, how could the path be clear? What was the point of practicing swordplay or cultivating the Dao?

Earlier, Lu Chen had casually tossed the lotus crown to Yu Zhenyi, suggesting he wear it. Lu Chen claimed he preferred to wear the clouds as a crown, a reflection of his wild and unrestrained nature.

This crown was the token of the master of the White Jade Capital, and Yu Zhenyi, of course, would not foolishly wear it on his head. Instead, he held it in both hands.

Lu Chen asked, “What else would you think?”

Yu Zhenyi nodded. After becoming a cultivator, he had wandered alone, traveling far and wide on his sword, so he had encountered many renowned feng shui treasures throughout the world.

It seemed that Master Lu had his own intentions.

Lu Chen questioned, “Are we walking in the wrong direction?”

Yu Zhenyi paused, then nodded again.

Lu Chen turned and swatted Yu Zhenyi on the head, admonishing, “Then why didn’t you say so earlier?”

Lu Chen began to ride the wind into the sky, urging Yu Zhenyi to lead the way towards Furong Mountain, which was thousands of miles away. 

However, Yu Zhenyi was unaware that this scholar from the White Jade Capital was not truly Lu Chen, and the lotus crown he held was not a physical object either. 

Lu Chen left the “scholar Zheng Huan” behind in the fifth realm, still needing to adhere to the regulations of the Confucian Temple, pressing him down beneath the Jade Purity realm, just as when he went to the Li Pearl Cave Heaven, where he had to be at the peak of the Ascended Realm.

Lu Chen reminisced about the old man from the Yang Family Apothecary, unable to help but murmur, “The stream bends and the mountain hides, flowers bloom and fall, the sea of clouds obscures the sun and moon, all relying on the Eastern Monarch.”

Lu Chen shook his head, “Lord Chen, do not blame the heavens.”

Yu Zhenyi had grown accustomed to the musings of the three masters of the White Jade Capital. 

For instance, Lu Chen would say that certain words from a person were like planting rice, planting trees, or scattering a handful of grass seeds across a desolate plain. 

Suddenly, Lu Chen asked, “Does he like to hide his name and work as a secretary in Songlai Country right under your nose? He even opened a shop selling folding fans and seals?”

Yu Zhenyi replied, “That is indeed the case. Lu Tai is a person of great elegance and charm, thus regarded as the second fallen immortal after Zhu Lian, the noble young master.”

Lu Chen rubbed his forehead, “You’re giving me a headache.”

The Lotus Flower Blessed Land had been divided into four parts, with the dilapidated mountain being renamed the Lotus Root Blessed Land, a lower-grade blessed land. 

However, where Yu Zhenyi resided was an upper-grade blessed land, placed by the old master within the Qingming World. 

The blessed lands of Lu Tai, as well as those where the young man, the White Monkey, and the young Daoist traveled together, were both of medium quality.

Currently, the blessed land where Lu Chen and Yu Zhenyi were guests was brought to the fifth realm by a small Daoist boy carrying a large sword-feeding gourd during the Spring Festival of the first year. 

The two swept over green mountains and clear waters, soaring higher than the white clouds and yellow cranes, finally catching sight of the mountain known as “Heaven Between Clouds and Water,” Furong Mountain, its peaks resembling blooming lotus flowers.

Lu Chen landed outside the territory of Furong Mountain, continuing to lead Yu Zhenyi on foot, traversing mountains and crossing waters. Whenever the weather turned misty, walking along the cliffside paths of Furong Mountain made it feel as though they were stepping into a realm of immortals, with deities amid the white clouds. 

After the Demon Sect's Supreme Master Ding Ying, the fallen immortal Lu Tai emerged, unifying the various factions of the Demon Sect in less than a decade. Lu Tai chose this Furong Mountain to establish a summer retreat, making it the most renowned forbidden place in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Today, with light rain falling on the mountain and mist swirling around, Lu Chen had just stepped onto a path when he recited, “Fine rain drizzles, the wind is gentle, my limbs stretch freely.”

Suddenly, three figures blocked their path.

The martial artist Tao Xieyang, the Daoist Huang Shang, and the versatile Huan Yin, adept in both martial arts and magical techniques.

Each one of them was a true top-tier hero in this blessed land. 

They were all direct disciples of Lu Tai, brought into this blessed land first as powerful figures of the Demon Dao, looking down upon the lords of the mountains below, and had slain many deities who ascended the mountains in the past twenty years. 

Among the previous ten figures in the world, those who had obtained celestial fortune, such as Zhou Fei from the Spring Tide Palace and Liu Zong, the Blade Master, had ventured to Tongye Continent, while those remaining in the blessed land were equally peculiar. First, Zhong Qiu had suddenly disappeared, and then the number one figure in the world, Yu Zhenyi, had broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, allowing him to ascend and leave. Ultimately, this led to a world where no one could rival the Demon Sect. 

No sects from the Jianghu could compete, nor could the celestial palaces on the mountains, nor the monarchs below the mountains.

Among the three direct disciples of Lu Tai, the Daoist Huang Shang had relatively restrained methods and was now the national master of the Southern Garden Kingdom, having received the title of Chongxu Zhenren.

In fact, Lu Tai, being bored, had let the Daoist sect of the world nominate four great real people, known as Tongxuan, Chongxu, Nanhua, and Dongling.

Aside from Huang Shang, a direct disciple of Yu Zhenyi from Lake Mountain Sect also obtained one of these titles.
In a world where Yu Zhenyi had fallen, Master Lu Tai found himself truly unmatched. Retreating into the mountains, he lived like a carefree cloud or a wild crane, showing little interest in worldly affairs and leaving the management of the realm to his three direct disciples. He only ventured occasionally to the capital of Nanyuan Kingdom, relishing the rain and snow, walking alone under an umbrella through the quiet streets. Even Huang Shang, the National Protector and one of his disciples, dared not approach him, never interrupting his master’s moments of tranquility. Rumors circulated that Master Lu had taken in a new disciple, yet Furong Mountain remained a forbidden place to all—tread there, and you would meet your end. Tao Xieyang and his companions had yet to see this new junior brother, but whispers suggested that the young man seen at Sword Lake Mountain Sect was indeed Master Lu’s close disciple.

Tao Xieyang and his companions were each in their respective nations, puzzled as to why they suddenly received a message delivered by flying sword from their master, instructing them to come to Furong Mountain to be guests.

Now a middle-aged Daoist, Huang Shang bowed deeply to Yu Zhenyi, his demeanor respectful. “Junior Huang Shang pays his respects to Immortal Yu.”

Tao Xieyang rested his hand on the hilt of his sword and leaned casually against the wooden railing of the path, grinning as he asked, “Is Immortal Yu returning in glory?”

Meanwhile, Huan Yin, who maintained a youthful appearance, showed little interest in Yu Zhenyi and was more intrigued by the cheerful scholar who seemed blissfully unaware of danger.

Yu Zhenyi dared not make any hasty moves, merely holding his sword and adjusting his Daoist crown, appearing as still as a wooden puppet. It wasn’t that he feared the three juniors before him; rather, he was uncertain of Lu Chen’s intentions. He didn’t want to complicate matters unnecessarily.

Lu Chen rolled up his sleeves and strode forward, laughing heartily. “I am Zheng Huan, fortunate to meet Immortal Yu. After serving by your side for many years, I’ve not only mastered fine martial arts but have also learned several Daoist techniques. Let’s see how you all fare against me—are you coming at me together, or one at a time?”

Tao Xieyang was quick to restrain his power, yet his strike was as swift as lightning. He casually slapped the scholar on the side of his head, sending him tumbling off the path and over the cliff, a long string of fading cries echoing as he fell.

Even Tao Xieyang himself was momentarily bewildered. Was that it?

Yu Zhenyi remained unmoved and sighed, “That lad is lucky; he may go down in history.”

In an instant, Yu Zhenyi sensed danger; he was now at the Cave Dwelling level of cultivation! And yet, the three masters of Baiyu Jing showed no signs of appearing. Had the scholar truly “fallen to his death” just like that?

A light rain fell in the mountains, shrouding the mid-slope path in mist. Yet at the summit of Furong Mountain, the sky was clear and bright.

There stood a striking figure dressed in white, with a jade belt, their beauty so striking it was hard to discern gender. Holding a folded bamboo fan inscribed with the phrases “Returning to One’s Hometown” and “Yellow Flower Inscription,” they admired the scenery from a stone platform at the mountain’s peak, embodying elegance and grace. Those who practiced Dao in the mountains cultivated their spirits, exuding a refreshing aura, untouched by the mundane world.

Behind them stood two delicate maidens adorned with jewels. 

One of them held a sword with a golden tassel attached to a seal made of lychee-flavored glaze, inscribed with the words “Stone Emerges from Qingtian, I Stand in the Blue Sky.” The heavenly inscription read “Uplift,” and the base inscription stated “Support the Heavens.” 

It was said that ancient people considered the difficulty of breaking stone as challenging as ascending to the heavens. However, a young seal-carving master in the capital of Songlai was renowned for his exquisite craftsmanship, as if a sword immortal was writing with a flying sword.

The other maiden cradled a pure white porcelain pillow, a style known as the Wuyou Pillow, also called the Longevity Pillow, symbolizing a carefree rest. Interestingly, aside from the lengthy inscription on the pillow, there was a faint blush mark near the phrase “In summer, the scenery is long, and the world is peaceful,” likely left by the maiden who had reclined while asleep, leaving a blush on the porcelain. Such a romantic and delicate image, even without being seen firsthand, was enough to stir the imagination.

Lu Tai waved his fan, and the two beautiful maidens vanished into thin air.

Lu Chen appeared at the mountain’s peak, chuckling, “How pitiful.”

Lu Tai smiled, “To be longed for yet unattainable, truly frustrating.”

He then tucked the fan away at his waist, bowing respectfully. “A descendant of the Lu family pays respects to our ancestor.”

Lu Chen asked, “So it is you who wishes to make Chen Ping the pillar of support?”

Lu Tai straightened up, picking up the fan again, feigning innocence. “Should the thoughtless words of future descendants be blamed on an ancestor who is as good as nonexistent?”

At that moment, Lu Chen was nothing like the fortune teller at Lvzhu Cave Heaven or Zheng Huan, who casually tossed a lotus crown to others. His expression was calm as he said, “Do you even know what you are doing?”

Lu Tai opened the fan, gently fanning a breeze, revealing the inscription “Descendant Lu Tai comes to see Ancestor Lu Chen.”

He regretted not having swapped the names’ positions earlier.

After a moment of silence, Lu Tai smiled and asked, “I've heard that our ancestor has five dreams, each manifesting an infinite path. Additionally, there are seven things of the heart—wooden chickens, chuan trees, moles, kunpengs, yellow sparrows, yuan zhu, and butterflies. I wonder if our ancestor could let me witness one of them?”

Lu Chen ignored him completely, instead turning to gaze over the edge of the viewing platform, hands clasped behind his back. He looked out over the distant mountains and waters, reciting, “Pity the man Liu Cai in the lush green paradise; pity the woman Liu Cai of Zhengyang Mountain. When the colorful phoenix flies in tandem, the spirit’s intuition connects. When we meet, it is also a parting, merely a fleeting journey in the wind. The scholar should not compare you to me in seeking the Way.”

Lu Chen suddenly laughed, turning to Lu Tai with a playful grin. “What’s all this about ancestor and descendant? You care too much, while I couldn’t care less—a perfect balance. Come on, let’s go to your thatched cottage for some wine. In peaceful times, the villagers have no worries about rice; the wine in a good year is the best.”

Lu Tai replied, “If you don’t show up to save him soon, Yu Zhenyi will be beaten to death. My disciple Huan Yin is quite the opportunist.”

Lu Chen slapped his forehead, “Almost forgot about that!”

Yet despite his words, Lu Chen showed no intention of intervening; he simply followed Lu Tai toward the secluded dwelling on Furong Mountain, which was far from what outsiders imagined—a mere couple of thatched cottages.

Barking sounded from behind the wooden door.

Lu Tai looked up at the sky, while Lu Chen tiptoed, hands resting on the door, grinning at the watchdog, “Sichuan dog barking at the sun. What a strange thing.”

Lu Tai addressed the dog, “Lu Chen, be quiet.”

The watchdog immediately lay down obediently.

Lu Chen laughed heartily, “Wonderful, wonderful! A disobedient descendant resembling the master!”

That day, it just so happened to snow on Furong Mountain, and Lu Chen decided to stay overnight. 

Lu Tai went to the summit to enjoy the snow while Lu Chen sat on a bamboo chair, smiling, “What a beautiful snowy night.” 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 859: The Formation Ahead**

On the southern peak of the Southern Mountains, within the temporary military encampment outside the Mountain Lord's Shrine, a rough structure resembling a military tent was hastily erected. The secretaries of the Great Li Dynasty and military generals from various vassal states flowed in and out, their footsteps hurried. Everyone wore a jade pendant, temporarily considered a pass for entry, modeled after the old dragon rain jade pendant from the Fu family of Old Dragon City. 

In a relatively quiet area, four individuals—two elders and two younger companions—leaned against the railing, gazing at the battlefield to the south. All four hailed from the Central Lands of the Divine Continent. One of the elders, gripping two military strategy balls, spun them gently in his hand like a martial artist playing with iron balls. He then picked up the rain pendant and said with a smile, “Ah, the Embroidered Tiger! A master of making money and saving money alike. Old Jiang, have you learned anything about frugality? In the Great Li battlefield, after our rough calculations, there are about three thousand six hundred matters at hand. Most of them involve earning and spending, while frugality only accounts for two hundred seventy-three. It is the small things, like this jade pendant, that truly showcase the skills of the Embroidered Tiger. When you teach at the ancestral mountain, you should emphasize this point.”

The other elder, known as Old Jiang, dressed in coarse linen clothes with a small fish basket tied at his waist, nodded. He then looked towards the layered formations on the distant battlefield and remarked, “Attack formations are established, and defenses are stationed strategically, interwoven and arranged with purpose—all adhering to military principles. Moreover, I can see familiar traces of state talent reserves and diplomatic strategies beyond military texts. It seems the Embroidered Tiger truly holds Young Master Wei in high regard. No wonder they say he wore out three books during his travels in his youth, one of which was Young Master Wei’s military treatise.”

The elder with the surname Wei stroked his beard and chuckled, “The other two books are somewhat superfluous; they might as well be side dishes for drinking. My military text, however, is the real fine wine.”

This wasn’t mere flattery; in fact, the elder Wei had received ample praise throughout his life, both in and out of books. 

He then earnestly added, “In the past, I thought that young Cui Chen was simply clever and shrewd, with skills only suitable for scholarly pursuits. He would make a fine deputy in any Confucian temple. But when it comes to military matters, especially practical combat, he might just be blowing hot air. Now, I realize I underestimated the Embroidered Tiger’s ability to govern and bring peace. It turns out that the mighty Embroidered Tiger truly possesses extraordinary means—quite impressive!”

Both elders, hailing from the ancestral grounds of military strategy in the Central Lands, belonged to the esteemed sects of Fengxue Temple and Zhenwu Mountain, both of which had deep connections to martial fortunes. The elder Jiang and the elder Wei were undoubtedly revered figures in the field of military strategy, though only as figures of the revival, considering the many gaps in the history of military strategy.

Beside the two elderly men stood a young man and woman. The young man was Xu Bai, renowned for his chess skills and often likened to the “Young Jiang Taigong” and “Xu Xian.” The young woman, named Chunqing, wore a finely woven blue robe made from bamboo silk. She had her hair tied in a ponytail that draped over her shoulder and carried a bamboo knife and sword at her waist. Chunqing hailed from the Bamboo Sea Cave and was the sole direct descendant of the Lady of Green God Mountain, being both the open and closed disciple.

Xu Bai quietly asked, “It’s astonishing how calm things are both above and below the Bao Ping Continent. Can this really be attributed to the people's hearts being in great use? Our journey southward took us along the coast for thousands of miles, yet it seems not a single cultivator attempted to flee from the Bao Ping Continent. Isn’t that strange? Not to mention Tongye Continent, but even the bold and fierce cultivators of Fuyiao and Jinjia Continents can’t claim such composure. Many have fled in groups, trying to escape the land.”

The elder Jiang smiled and replied, “The reasoning is simple: the cultivators of Bao Ping Continent dare not, cannot, and do not wish to leave. They do not dare because the laws of the Great Li are strict. The very existence of the coastal battlefront serves as a deterrent. The heads of the celestial beings on the mountain are no different from those of ordinary scholars; if they abandon their posts without permission, they will be killed without question. That is the current rule of the Great Li. They cannot leave because all the vassal states, along with the local deities and their own ancestral halls, are keeping a watchful eye. No one wants to face repercussions. And they do not wish to leave because this battle on Bao Ping is destined to be even more brutal than the Three Continent battlefield. Even the rural children and idle ruffians do not believe that the Great Li—or rather, the Bao Ping Continent—will inevitably lose this war.”

Xu Bai looked toward a battlefield below, spotting a heavily armored general, and quietly asked, “Is this person, already holding the highest rank among Great Li generals, really willing to die? Is it his choice, or does the Embroidered Tiger require his death to serve as an example for the border troops to pacify the vassal states after the battle?”

The elder Jiang smiled and said, “Which of the generals in the Great Li border army has not risen from the dead? From Song Changjing to Su Gaoshan and Cao Ping, they all follow the same path. If the position comes with a larger hat, one wouldn’t want to die, as if life suddenly becomes too precious. If that were the case, the Great Li cavalry wouldn’t be nearly as formidable. Xu Bai, have you considered that the position of the Zhongguo’s pillar can be inherited without replacement? And it will increasingly trend towards civil titles in the future. Then what about the position of the Patrol Envoy, the top military rank among generals? The Great Li emperor has never mentioned this matter, likely because the state master Cui Chen has never brought it up. Why? Because once the Patrol Envoy dies heroically in battle—whether it’s Su Gaoshan or the main general on the eastern front, Cao Ping—only then can the Embroidered Tiger bring it up without issue. I believe General Su Gaoshan is well aware of this…”

Xu Bai couldn’t help but say, “But Su Gaoshan is only in his fifties; why should we demand he die on the battlefield? Even if it could benefit his descendants, ensuring their glory for generations, how can we guarantee that the reputation of the Patrol Envoy will be inherited by future generations? It’s only natural to worry…”

At this point, Xu Bai nodded to himself and continued, “I understand now. After dying in battle, he could be honored as a heroic spirit in the Martial Temple, just like the two great pillars of Yuan and Cao. With the help of Gao Cheng and Zhong Kui, he could still command the shadow troops on the battlefield. Even in death, he could still watch over and protect his family.”

Chunqing interjected, “Mr. Cui is indeed a man of great talent, with a keen insight into human nature.”

In his youth, the Confucian scholar Cui Chen had some “grievances” with the Bamboo Sea Cave, but Chunqing’s master, the Lady of Green God Mountain, had a positive impression of Cui Chen. Thus, despite Chunqing being too young to have interacted with the Embroidered Tiger, she held Cui Chen in high regard and sincerely addressed him as “Mr. Cui.” As her master would say, a swordsman of poor character could still befriend someone worthy, as the Green God was not one to hold grudges over trivial matters.

Suddenly, Xu Bai’s eyes widened.

A young man in white appeared from afar, seemingly moving leisurely yet actually darting with remarkable speed. The vigilant guards at the Southern Peak appeared unfazed, intentionally ignoring him. Xu Bai immediately recalled the young man’s identity; he was a mysterious figure shrouded in intrigue, bearing a string of titles. Not only was he the leader of the southern spies of Great Li, but he also held a pivotal role behind the scenes in the central capital and a major river. Though he had no official title among the recognized officials of the Great Li, he was an extremely vital and influential character.

As the young man meandered around the four individuals, he feigned surprise, exclaiming, “Oh wow, isn’t this our unbeatable chess master, Old Jiang? Still dressed so plainly! Fishing, are we? No problem, no problem! With this vast pond, what fish and shrimp could there not be? There’s one called Feng Fei, a real big catch! And with Old Wei’s help, catching Feng Fei should be a piece of cake. My only fear is that Old Jiang’s little fish basket won’t be enough…”

Just then, an old scholar with white sideburns suddenly appeared, placing a hand on the head of Cui Dongshan to stop him from continuing. The white-clad young man tumbled to the ground, pretending to be outraged. He attempted a somersault but failed to get up, instead bouncing back and forth on the ground like a clumsy martial artist, ultimately ending up disgruntled as he rose. Xu Bai, who usually adhered to propriety, found himself puzzled; how could the Embroidered Tiger not use any magical arts or restraints, yet the young man was in such a sorry state?

Cui Chen, in his role as a scholar, bowed to the two venerable figures of military strategy.

The two elders, who had been sharing light-hearted banter moments before, now returned the gesture with solemn respect.

Respect is something that cannot be sought after; if it comes, it cannot be stopped.

Cui Chen smiled and said, “Old Jiang, Mr. Wei, come walk with me and chat for a bit?”

The two venerable strategists followed Cui Chen as he led the way, leaving behind the three young people, who appeared to be of similar age. If one were to calculate Cui Dongshan’s “real” age from the moment he entered the Li Pearl Cave, it would indeed be comparable to that of Chunqing and Xu Bai.

Cui Dongshan leaned against the railing, gazing about ten thousand miles away to the southernmost point of the Bao Ping Continent, where land met sea.

Now, aside from the Old Dragon City, the entire Southern Mountain region had transformed into the second battlefield of the Bao Ping Continent, following the Old Dragon City, bracing for a continuous influx of demon armies from the wilderness. 

To the south of the Southern Mountains, the vast battlefield had stripped peaks and ridges bare. The elite forces of the Great Li and its vassals had gathered here. The Great Li’s direct cavalry numbered three hundred thousand, including two hundred fifty thousand light cavalry and fifty thousand heavy cavalry. Each rider and steed donned water cloud armor, with every piece engraved with water patterns by talismanic cultivators, without overly pursuing intricate details in the engravings.

The Great Li’s three hundred thousand cavalry was led by General Su Gaoshan, a man of cold ancestry, who had risen through remarkable military achievements to become the first Patrol Envoy in the history of the Great Li Dynasty, holding a rank equivalent to that of the old pillars of the Great Li.

Eighty thousand heavy infantry were divided into five major formations. Although these formations appeared to be several dozen miles apart, such distance was negligible in the context of this war and battlefield.

These eighty thousand heavy infantry were drawn from various southern vassal states of the Bao Ping Continent, all clad in heavy armor. Depending on their respective formations and stationed positions, the soldiers wore different colored mountain-patterned five-element armors, similar to the five-colored earth of the Great Li’s mountains and rivers. All five colors derived from the mountains and peaks of the vassal states, having been painstakingly crafted under the supervision of the Great Li’s border forces, using thousands of mountain creatures along with Mo family mechanisms and talismanic powers to excavate and forge these armors day and night.

The three hundred thousand cavalry were divided into five groups, with three light cavalry and two heavy cavalry, positioned between the infantry, creating a battlefield layout that mirrored the mountains and rivers.

General Su Gaoshan stood among the assembled troops, gripping an iron spear.

With thirty years of military life, he had risen from obscurity as a border soldier to the highest military official of a region, akin to a nation’s general.

Mounted high on his steed, Su Gaoshan glanced back. Unfortunately, the towering Southern Mountains obstructed his view. Otherwise, he would have seen the vast and splendid landscape stretching northward, encompassing the entire territory of the Great Li. At this moment in life, he could be said to be living in the right time and place, destined for greatness.

With one hand gently tapping the hilt of his sword and the other lifting his helmet, the only Patrol Envoy of the Great Li from a cold background spoke with a resolute gaze and a low voice, “Let Su be the one to carve a path for all future descendants of the cold clan.”

In front of the cavalry and infantry, at the forefront of the battlefield, there was also a line of barricades formed by the young and strong soldiers of the vassal states, numbering up to eighty thousand. Behind them lay a second line of soldiers wielding massive sabers. Both groups had signed military warrants with their respective courts, taking on the role of death warriors, establishing an unprecedented barrier.

Between the cavalry and infantry, the mountain cultivators of the Bao Ping Continent had set up their formations, alongside twelve thousand archers and twelve thousand catapults, arranged in a crescent shape. Additionally, there were three thousand heavy crossbows, each bolt as large as an iron spear, striking with the force of thunder, their might rivaling that of the flying swords wielded by mid-level cultivators.

On this frontline, the warriors from Zhenwu Mountain and Fengxue Temple, the ancestral sites of military strategy on the Bao Ping Continent, served as commanders. The Zhenwu cultivators were particularly familiar with battlefield formations and had often been involved in the armies of the Great Li and its vassals, most having risen to mid-level or higher military ranks. They not only engaged in combat but also needed to strategize and command troops. The Fengxue cultivators, in contrast, had a style more akin to that of wandering knights, often found among the border forces of various states. Among the ten young candidates, one named Ma Kuxuan commanded several deities from the Zhenwu ancestral site, standing firm on either side.

The female sect leader of the Pima Sect, Xuan Chi, wielded a blade inscribed with the characters “Heavenly Might, Slaughtering Ten Thousand Ghosts.”

She stood alongside a skeletal swordsman from the Bone Swamp, known as Pu Rang. The latter, tall and clad in a black robe, executed a concealment technique that temporarily restored his true form, revealing a strikingly beautiful young woman.

Xuan Chi smiled and said, “Pu Rang, it turns out you look this lovely! A beauty! That bald donkey from the Great Crescent Monastery must be blind. If we manage to survive and return home, I’ll take it upon myself to seek justice for you. You wouldn’t want to scold him, but I’m an outsider and can easily find an excuse to berate him. That’ll leave the bald fellow even more confused.”

As soon as Xuan Chi finished speaking, a monk appeared, wearing the first-class peace token of the Great Li’s Judicial Department at his waist, and came gliding over the wind, landing beside Xuan Chi and Pu Rang.

It was a true immortal from the Xiaoxuan Temple, accompanied by a monk who had unresolved issues in his heart and could not attain Buddhahood from the Great Crescent Monastery.

Standing beside Pu Rang, the monk turned his head to look at her and softly said, “Those who attain Buddhahood do so, and those who have compassion do so. If one cannot attain Buddhahood for lack of understanding, then it is best to misinterpret the Buddha, Tathāgata.”

Pu Rang merely turned her head and then turned away, seemingly unable to face the monk.

Xuan Chi stomped her foot, exclaiming, “Good grief, how sour!”

The old immortal chuckled, “Sect Leader Xuan, you’re really a mood killer.”

Xuan Chi, holding onto the hilt of her sword, raised her head high, gazing toward the south and scoffed, “What nonsense! I, along with Li Cai and Pu Rang, represent the women of North Julu Continent. Whether we are swordsmen or ghosts, we are all scenery in our own right!”

A large group of cultivators were stationed atop several mountain ranges in the Southern Peaks. The majority of the lower realm Qi practitioners were concentrated at the ancestral mountain of the Southern Peaks, spreading from the foot of the mountain to the halfway point, where the rich spiritual energy condensed into thick mist, causing some to feel as if they were “drunk.”

Higher up, several floating sword boats hovered in the air.

The vassal king, Song Mu, personally commanded the military camp outside the shrine at the top of the Southern Mountains.

During the battle of Old Dragon City, Song Mu had retreated quite late.

The vassal king safeguarded the country’s gates.

At the midpoint of the Southern Mountains, the heroic spirit Gao Cheng and the ghostly figure of Zhong Kui, both from Tongye Continent’s Shuyuan Academy, stood beside an elderly monk, who was stroking his bald head. 

A child stood behind Gao Cheng, calling out to him, then informing him that their master, Cui Dongshan, had arrived at the Southern Mountains.

Gao Cheng ignored this.

At the Southern Mountains’ Crown Prince Peak, two martial artists of the tenth realm, Li Er and Wang Fuxu, stood side by side. Additionally, the head of the Shuyuan Academy, Zhou Mi, who also shared the name with the great demon Tuoyue Mountain, had left a furious remark at the academy and brought a large group of scholars southward to the Bao Ping Continent. However, Zhou Mi kept the academy’s disciples in the central capital, coming south alone, now responsible for guarding the Southern Mountains alongside his friends Li Er and the old man Wang Fuxu.
In this serene abode of the Southern岳储君 (Southern Monarch's Peak), located just beneath the Sacred Shrine at the summit, prominent families of Old Dragon City have temporarily taken refuge. Among them are the Fu family and the Sun family, as well as several renowned sword immortals from Zhengyang Mountain and the old sword sage, not to mention Xu Hun, the lord of Qingfeng City. They are all settling into their respective tranquil courtyards, while the young lord of Old Dragon City, Fu Nanhua, reminisces with the元婴祖师 (Yuan Ying Patriarch) Cai Jin of Yunxia Mountain.

The major clans of Old Dragon City have already relocated outside the city. However, their losses remain immeasurable. Fortunately, before the great war, several trade routes had allowed them to amass a considerable fortune. Though they have suffered significant setbacks, they are not entirely down for the count. As long as the Baoping Continent (Treasure Bottle Continent) can hold its ground, they can negotiate from a position of strength. This is essentially a gamble where one either wins big or loses everything; moreover, the Da Li Empire (Great Li Empire) leaves them no choice but to comply.

As the leading family, the Fu family of Old Dragon City has shown the most determination. The other vassal families can only swallow their pride and put on a brave face, concealing any hint of resentment. After all, should they emerge victorious from this war, their fortunes would be restored tenfold.

As for the intercontinental ferry services operated by Old Dragon City, including those to Osmanthus Island and Shanhai Turtle, they have already migrated to the northern regions of the Baoping Continent.

The Xu couple, along with their legitimate son Xu Binxian, are secretly discussing matters with the patriarch of the Tao family from Zhengyang Mountain, the mountain guardian, and the female Tao Zi.

Xu Hun, now a warrior at the Jade Purity realm, donned in armor, gazes impassively at the nervous woman who has come to apologize. His tone is not overly harsh, “The Fox Kingdom is not just some city where closing the doors and activating the city’s defensive arrays can cut off all news. With such a vast territory spanning thousands of miles, it’s impossible for it to vanish without a trace. Haven’t any of the pieces we set in motion sent word back to Qingfeng City?”

The Xu matriarch shakes her head. “I don’t know why, but we haven’t received any news.”

Xu Hun furrows his brow slightly. “Is that outsider named Yan Fang really a remnant of the Du Gu clan from the Zhu Ying Dynasty?”

The Xu matriarch cautiously replies, “The Zhu Ying Dynasty fell years ago amidst chaos. That sword-cultivating dynasty was notorious for its intricate web of connections—each figure shrouded in mystery. This Yan Fang operates too sneakily, and the clues regarding the Zhu Ying Dynasty are fragmented and unreliable, making it difficult to ascertain if he truly belongs to the Du Gu remnants.”

This isn’t the matriarch’s evasion; for instance, the Cao Rong from the now-defunct Bai Shuang Dynasty appeared on the battlefield of Old Dragon City, showcasing remarkable abilities that astonished the cultivators of the Baoping Continent. Such a powerful figure, though his exact level remains uncertain, has methods that are extraordinarily profound, easily comparable to an immortal.

His skills are not inferior to those of the newly risen Da Tianjun (Great Heavenly Lord) Qi Zhen from the Divine Preach Sect.

While the ruins of Old Dragon City might have fallen into the hands of barbaric creatures, the morale among the cultivators of the Baoping Continent, both from the mountains and the cavalry, remains high. Even in the face of numerous casualties, the spirit of the fight is undiminished—everyone is eager for battle!

As for the Tongye Continent, it truly is a mess that can be easily toppled. It’s a wonder we once regarded our Baoping Continent as a minor player, thinking the powerful neighbors to the south were something to be feared. Many local reports suggested that the Golden Elixirs of Tongye could slay the元婴 (Yuan Ying) of Baoping, leading countless Qi practitioners to believe it without question. But in reality, our own foundation is much deeper and our ambitions grander.

However, for the current Qingfeng City, having half of its financial resources inexplicably cut off with no clear leads certainly dampens their spirits.

“Even with Zhengyang Mountain's assistance, sending local sword cultivators from the Central Peak region to look for clues about Yan Fang is proving difficult,” the matriarch laments, wiping her tears with a handkerchief.

Xu Hun waves his hand dismissively. “Then we shall deliberate further.”

Some matters are better kept behind closed doors, discussed only among trusted allies.

The patriarch of the Tao family chuckles, “So far, no one from the Fallen Cliff Mountain has shown up on the battlefield.”

“Perhaps someone has, but they’ve gained no recognition,” Xu Binxian quips. “It seems they’ve only provided a ferryboat to the Da Li army—hardly a great contribution. Those who have been in the business long enough know how to win hearts. Riding on the coattails of Lord Wei from the Piyun Mountain, they’ve secured ties with the esteemed Pima Sect and Chunlu Garden of the Northern Julu Continent. They’ve become the largest landowners in the former Li Pearl territory, surpassing even the Longquan Sword Sect.”

The rugged, white-clad elder from Zhengyang Mountain, with his muscular build and arms crossed, scoffs, “What a turn of fortune, making that brat famous.”

Xu Binxian can’t help but add, “Piyun Mountain indeed possesses a terrifying depth of resources. Yet, Wei Bo has clearly been abandoned by the Da Li. His divine status was merely a puppet; he rose too strangely. It’s a cold stove—who can light it? Fallen Cliff Mountain has struck lucky.”

The Xu matriarch timidly remarks, “I just don’t understand why the young mountain lord has been silent all these years.”

The elder in white smirks, “A commoner from a shabby alley; what waves can he make in less than thirty years? I’m seeking him out for revenge. Back when I was at Zhengyang Mountain, he didn’t dare approach, and now that he’s left, he still hides. Such a cowardly character is unworthy of your mention; even a careless mention would tarnish your ears.”

The Xu matriarch, perhaps feeling guilty, speaks softly today, her voice gentle and hesitant. “It’s better to be cautious; the mountains are fraught with surprises. If that young man hasn’t engaged in cultivation, that’s one thing, but he has amassed quite a fortune. We must not underestimate him, especially with strong backing and many connections to other mountain sects. I fear he has been quietly plotting all these years; perhaps even the disappearance of the Fox Kingdom is a preemptive strike from Fallen Cliff Mountain. Coupled with the fortunate Liu Xianyang, Fallen Cliff Mountain has established ties with Longquan Sword Sect, making it increasingly troublesome for us to deal with them. At the very least, we must be wary of the Da Li throne’s stance. After all, if we disregard Fallen Cliff Mountain, both Wei Shanjun and Ruan Shengren are crucial figures in the heart of the Da Li emperor.”

The elder lets out a hearty laugh, rubbing his palms together and teasingly saying, “If we must fret over all these trivial matters, why not be more direct? Let Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City share some battlefield achievements with me, and I’ll smash half of Fallen Cliff Mountain with a single punch. Let’s see if that kid dares to continue hiding like a turtle.”

At this point, an exceptionally handsome middle-aged swordsman, claiming to be from the Northern Julu Continent, has emerged. His swordsmanship is remarkable, having impressed many on the battlefield of Old Dragon City with his swift strikes against demons. He is currently posing as a guest from Piyun Mountain, stationed at the coastal warfront of the Eastern岳 (Eastern Peak).

Word has it that a female Golden Elixir sword cultivator named Sui has become renowned for her decisive strikes against enemies; she is as ruthless as she is stunning, garnering admiration even from the two female sect leaders of the Northern Julu Continent, Li Cai and Zhu Quan.

These individuals, either local cultivators or those from the Northern Julu Continent, seem to have little connection to Fallen Cliff Mountain.

Meanwhile, a martial artist named Zheng Qian has just arrived at Southern岳储君 (Southern Monarch’s Peak), seeking out her former mentor, Li Er.

In fact, she is quite close to the key figures of Qingfeng City and Zhengyang Mountain.

Outside this celestial estate, a white-clad youth crouches stealthily by the wall, his ear pressed against it, whispering in admiration, “Forget about Taoist skills and martial arts; just in terms of courage, none of the throne’s rulers can compare to you. You should be acknowledged as the rightful patriarch of the Fallen Cliff Mountain! After all, how many true powerhouses are there in this world worth my master and mistress risking their lives to confront together?”

Next to Cui Dongshan, a girl in a green robe named Chunqing nods in agreement, recalling her master’s comments about the young hidden official and the ascendant Ning Yao, “I admire him; he’s truly impressive.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 860: Ask Me About the Spring Breeze

The assembly of heroes finally came to an end. Crouching against the wall, Cui Dongshan sat cross-legged and began to chat casually with Chunqing in a voice that only she could hear. "Why didn’t Madam of Qing Shen Mountain wait a decade or so? At least wait until you reach the Upper Five Realms or the Mountain Pinnacle Realm before leaving the Bamboo Sea Cave? The world is so chaotic now, and geniuses are the least valued; they can disappear at any moment. She’s put me in quite a predicament. Let's agree on this: you must come back alive to the Central Land, no falling in cultivation, and certainly no dying easily."

For both personal and emotional reasons, Cui Dongshan did not want the only direct disciple of Madam Qing Shen Mountain to perish in Baoping Continent.

Cui Dongshan held great respect for Madam Qing Shen Mountain; he trusted her. Back in the day, that old bastard had become a pariah across the entire Haoran world, and the Yu family of Central Land, the Liu family of Aiai Continent, and even the Bamboo Sea Cave had all offered their help. Yu Panshui and Liu Jubao, despite their positions, were still human and had their own feelings—hoping that Xiu Hu could be both a friend and a mentor. Only Madam Qing Shen Mountain asked for nothing; she merely saw a friend in distress and happened to have wine available on her mountain, and that was all.

Chunqing squatted beside him, "My master says that when it comes to martial arts, even if a Lower Realm fighter helps you and hits hard, no one’s going to die. So it’s more useful to fight a Mountain Pinnacle Realm expert to the death. Don’t worry, before I left my hometown, my master and I agreed that I would either return alive to inherit the Qing Mountain Divine Temple or die outside, and then my master would act as if I never existed."

Cui Dongshan nodded. "That makes sense. If you were to face my master, it would just be a matter of my master using a couple of sword strikes and one punch. My master has encountered several peers on the battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall, such as the likely throne contender, the demon sword immortal, Shoucheng, and Feiran, the leader of the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain. Both sword cultivators excel in unraveling complexities and exchanging injuries for kills, specifically targeting so-called young geniuses."

Chunqing asked, "Is there really such a gap between me and your master?"

Chen Shiyi, the Hidden Official, was the last of the Ten Young People. However, in Central Land, it was universally acknowledged that there was an insurmountable chasm between the Ten Young People and the Ten Young Candidates.

Chunqing had long reached the Far Travel Realm while also being a bottlenecked Qi Refining practitioner at the Nascent Soul stage. She was well-versed in the Five Element techniques, thunder laws, sword and saber combat, spirit possession, and ghost taming, and she was an exceptionally skilled formation master, proficient in close combat, tracking, stealth, and quick escapes. Madam Qing Shen had treated the young Chunqing as her own, nurturing her personally. Moreover, due to the connections of the Bamboo Sea Cave, Chunqing had received guidance from four different masters in martial arts within just over a decade.

What was most terrifying was that Chunqing was only in her early twenties now. When she entered the ranks of the young Ten Candidates, she was merely fourteen, making her the youngest among both the Ten Young People and the Ten Candidates.

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "The difference between you and my master isn’t really in realms. To be precise, if realms were merely a matter of arithmetic, you were slightly ahead when the rankings were first announced. However, in mountain combat, the results are often immediate and life-and-death can be decided in an instant. Miss Chunqing, your knowledge is broad and profound, which is certainly a good thing; it allows you to navigate life and death freely, thereby avoiding many unexpected situations. Unfortunately, when you encounter my master, who enjoys pondering all the variables, you might still die. I’m being blunt here; don’t take offense."

Chunqing shook her head, "I’m not angry, just a little unconvinced."

Cui Dongshan grinned, "I appreciate your straightforward nature, Miss Chunqing. How about we become sworn siblings? We can even perform the ritual right here, we have everything prepared. When we descend the mountain and walk the rivers and lakes, we must have this formal rite."

Chunqing shook her head again, "If we do that, wouldn’t it lower the Hidden Official's status? That wouldn’t be worth it."

Cui Dongshan patted his chest confidently, "That’s easy to fix. We can just call each other brother and sister."

Chunqing turned to look at the sincere-faced "young man" beside her, her expression filled with confusion. Was he the foolish one, or did he think she was? Yet how could a fool cultivate to the realm of an immortal? If it weren’t for the reminder from the old warlord Jiang Taigong before she set off, she might have mistaken him for merely a local immortal. However, after he had been straightforward on their journey from Southern Mount to the Medicine Gathering Mountain and even cursed out a certain someone for his misdeeds in the Bamboo Sea Cave years ago, the young girl felt a bit of closeness to him. As for why Cui Dongshan kept emphasizing that Cui Chan, that old bastard, had only reached the peak of his life when he was young, Chunqing found it utterly incomprehensible.

After staring at Cui Dongshan for a while, during which he merely met her gaze with clear eyes, she had no choice but to withdraw her gaze and change the subject. "I hope I can have the chance in the future to spar with your master in swordplay and boxing, to determine a victor."

Cui Dongshan nodded vigorously like a chick pecking at grains. "Sparring is great! You don’t know, my master is known for being gentle, respectful, modest, and courteous—a true gentleman, especially when it comes to sparring with women; he always keeps it within limits. However, my master is quite busy, and he hasn’t returned home yet. Even when he does, he rarely makes a move, preferring to reason things out rather than act. Ordinary people can hardly hope to spar with him, but since we have this relationship, it’s no problem to ask him about swordsmanship and boxing. As one of my master’s most valued and beloved disciples, I can surely say a few words on your behalf."

Chunqing cupped her fists in thanks but then asked with some puzzlement, "Just keeping it within limits? That isn’t necessary. I wouldn’t say I can take a hit, but I can hold my own. You can let your master go all out, as long as no one dies."

Cui Dongshan’s expression became strange as he wiped his face with his sleeve.

Unwilling to give up, Cui Dongshan continued, "In the future, I’ll take you to Luopo Mountain and arrange for you to be a nominal worshipper there. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? And my neighbor, the Cloudy Peak Mountain, actually has some connections with the Bamboo Sea Cave. The mountain lord Wei Ba has a bamboo forest that he calls half a Bamboo Sea Cave, and he also boasts a small Qing Shen Mountain. I tried my best to persuade him to tone it down, but he just said that his bamboo forest is so vibrant and full of life that it’s only fitting to call it half a Bamboo Sea Cave. How could that be unfounded?"

Chunqing didn’t mind the references to half a Bamboo Sea Cave or small Qing Shen Mountain; she only asked, "Is that the Wei Mountain Lord who loves to host night feasts?"

Cui Dongshan replied indignantly, "Nonsense! Who loves to host night feasts? Don’t slander my neighbor Wei Mountain Lord. Hosting night feasts is not a matter of preference; it’s about obligation! Each time, it’s the mountain and water spirits and the immortal masters from the North Mountain region who insist on celebrating with him. What can Wei Mountain Lord do? How can he refuse such hospitality without disappointing everyone? Should he sacrifice his reputation just to avoid hurting the feelings of the soldiers?"

With a grand flourish of his sleeves, Cui Dongshan declared passionately, "With two sleeves of clear wind, Wei Mountain Lord only accepts a little token for the night feast; he certainly isn’t just seeking reputation!"

Chunqing asked quietly, "Do you have a grudge against Wei Mountain Lord?"

Cui Dongshan turned sideways, leaning back with a look of surprise. "What are you talking about? Miss Chunqing, have you misunderstood me?"

Chunqing remarked, "I can see it now; you’re not being straightforward."

Cui Dongshan sighed dramatically, then suddenly pressed his face against the wall. Chunqing, curious, asked, "Isn’t that grand mountain-moving ancestor from Zhengyang Mountain already gone to Qingfeng City? What are you eavesdropping for?"

Cui Dongshan muttered, "Before, they were just putting on a show of brotherhood, but now they’re being sincere, and it’s all very exciting. They didn’t say not to eavesdrop; if I can listen, why not?"

Chunqing retorted, "That’s not very honorable."

Cui Dongshan replied pitifully, "How could that be? You can ask Gao Cheng from Jingguan City. If I were not an honorable person, would I help him find his long-lost brother?"

Chunqing remained skeptical but said, "Using the old method, you can lend me your divine power to take a look; it’s indeed quite interesting."

Cui Dongshan's smile brightened as he brought his fingers together and pretended to hand something to Chunqing. Gently placing it in her palm, she opened her hand to find a shimmering image suspended above—a landscape of rippling waters. By using a grain of her spiritual energy to explore within, she would be able to hear and see everything as if she were there in person, and it allowed her to share the experience with Cui Dongshan.

In this grand residence where various immortals were accommodated, most were from the Zhengyang Mountain or Qingfeng City sects, or second-rate immortal factions that were just a step away from being sects. However, at present, the highest realm in this vast courtyard was merely Xu Huan, a freshly minted Jade Purity Realm cultivator. Xu Huan was renowned for his immense destructive power; aside from that, he wasn’t proficient in other techniques or spells and wouldn’t be able to detect the secret eavesdropping of an immortal cultivator. Moreover, Cui Dongshan preferred to play the role of a second-rate spy from the Green Wave Pavilion of the Great Li, with all the necessary documents and tokens. He also had numerous other titles, such as being a guest of the Fu family from Old Dragon City, a guest elder of the Jiang family from Yunlin, and a fire envoy of the Northern Mountain Crown Prince—he had everything one could ask for.

Even if Cui Dongshan were to pull out a register from the Medicine Gathering Mountain Temple within a single incense stick’s time, it would be no issue; the mountain deity would surely hand it over willingly.

The mountain they stood on, the Southern Crown Prince Mountain, was called Caizhi Mountain. The Mountain Deity was once the Great Mountain Lord of Southern Crown, but after becoming a vassal state of the Great Li, Caizhi Mountain was demoted to the Southern Crown Prince Mountain, which seemed a demotion but was actually a significant elevation in the mountain’s official status. In this Southern Crown region, it could be said to rise above all other mountains. Caizhi Mountain produced a unique soil known as Yourang, a coveted material for the spirits and heroes to establish their own sanctuaries, as well as a treasure sought after by cultivators for raising spirits.

A middle-aged Qi Refiner from the Sea-Gazing Realm was hurrying past when he noticed the two squatting at the wall. He slowed his pace and turned his head several times, frowning more and more. Such disregard for the mountain's customs was unacceptable; neither wore the peace talisman issued by the Great Li's Ministry of Justice, nor did they have the rain talisman forged in Old Dragon City and distributed by the vassal estates. Were these two disciples of some small sect descending the mountain for training? But the rules here on Caizhi Mountain were strict, and this Deer-Ming Residence was a gathering place for the top immortals of the continent; how could they act recklessly? What kind of teaching had their elders given them to allow these two youngsters to run wild?

The Sea-Gazing Realm cultivator from the Tingyun Pavilion halted his steps, his face filled with displeasure. "What are you two doing? Which mountain are you from? Do you even know the rules? State your names, and I’ll report this matter to the manager of Deer-Ming Residence! Or should I drag you to see Chief Manager Chu?!"

Cui Dongshan, while eavesdropping, glared at the old immortal from the Sea-Gazing Realm.

Chunqing pointed at Cui Dongshan, indicating that the white-clad youth should take charge. Then she stood up and squatted on the other side of Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan did not lift his rear but shifted half a circle to change his face against the wall, presenting his backside to the old immortal from Tingyun Pavilion. The Sea-Gazing Realm cultivators from Tingyun Pavilion had three generations of ancestors who were incredibly tough immortals. While their realms weren’t high, they were known for their boldness in combat and were similar to the Invincible Divine Fist Sect. However, as the times changed, each generation became weaker, and now their ranks were filled with infamous scholars and sages who were known to act like busybodies. Years ago, they had attached themselves to a legendary sword immortal of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, who was unmatched in swordsmanship and flying swords. Now, it seemed they were once again scheming to cling to Zhengyang Mountain's influence, relying on money and past relationships to worm their way into this Deer-Ming Residence.

Ironically, that Nascent Soul sword cultivator who had fled from Shujian Lake had met his demise at the hands of Ruan Xiu and Cui Dongshan.

The Sea-Gazing Realm cultivator from Tingyun Pavilion was furious but did not shout for a fight; instead, he intended to report to Chief Manager Chu, who was in charge of the Caizhi Mountain temple. Chunqing glanced at him and in an instant vanished without a trace. There were no signs or ripples of energy, which was quite strange; Chunqing only saw Cui Dongshan shake his sleeve, likely having drawn her into the unique spatial realm that only Upper Realm cultivators possess.

Curious, Chunqing asked, "How did you do that? Generally, I can detect the movements of an immortal's divine powers."

Cui Dongshan gently raised that snow-white sleeve. Chunqing focused her gaze and discovered two rows of tiny characters, resembling small grass sway in the water, inscribed on his robe. "Birds in the sun and moon, duckweed on the water."

Chunqing had also studied talismans and was now beaming with excitement. "Did you just capture that person using a talisman formation?"

Cui Dongshan smiled, "No, capturing a Sea-Gazing Realm cultivator to help him bolster his resolve doesn’t require such a grand show. I merely wanted to show off my robe; it’s not inferior to that bamboo outfit you’re wearing, is it?"

Chunqing fell silent.

After the three from Zhengyang Mountain left, Xu Huan had been sitting in his study with his eyes closed, neither reprimanding his wife nor speaking a word.

The armor he wore, resembling the famed Divine Armor of Divine Revelation, was fundamentally different; it was not a defensive treasure but a mysterious offensive artifact, solidifying his status as the foremost cultivator beneath the Upper Realm before even entering the Jade Purity Realm.

His eldest son Xu Bin, reclining against the chair, pulled out a widely circulated travelogue among the mountains, flipping through it with great interest.

Xu Huan's wife slowly rose, wanting to say something but hesitating.

When Xu Huan opened his eyes, without any visible movements, a crisp slap echoed through the room, instantly reddening the side of his wife's face.

Xu Bin lifted his head, glancing at his parents, then returned to his book.

This young cultivator had no record of combat, but he carried a short sword and a talisman blade on the same side of his waist, tied together with a purple ribbon.

Xu Huan's wife covered her face with one hand, revealing no signs of anger. Instead, her voice was soft as she reminded her husband through their mental connection, "We should still isolate ourselves from the world to prevent the upcoming discussions from being overheard by the Tao family elders of Zhengyang Mountain; they are known for their underhanded tactics and have no qualms about anything."

Xu Huan scoffed, "Do you think my Jade Purity Realm is just for show? That old thief Tao is merely a Nascent Soul cultivator; he’s not foolish."

Xu Bin continued to flip through the pages. "One must be careful; I have a feeling that Zhengyang Mountain is shrouded in mystery."

Xu Huan pondered for a moment, then employed a secret technique unique to Qingfeng City to block their surroundings. He then fixed a dark gaze on his wife and said, "A fox nation is equivalent to half of Qingfeng City’s wealth. Pei Xiang is still a Nascent Soul cultivator. The fox skin talismans not only bring in money but also help establish connections in the mountain realm for Qingfeng City. Furthermore, the true significance of the fox nation is something you should know well: the accumulated cultural fortune of hundreds of years; Xu Bin’s sister is still waiting at the Yuan family, hoping for this fortune!"

Xu Huan's wife fell silent, tears falling silently.

The Xu family had married their legitimate daughter to the Yuan family’s commoner son, aiming for something grand—that “civil officials should ascend to the pillar of the nation, and military generals should also hold the position of patrol officials.”

Xu Huan sighed, his expression softening slightly. "Let’s sit down and talk. Did your senior brother, Chai Bofu, really just vanish into thin air?" 

In name, Qingfeng City was under the control of Xu Huan and the fox nation's lord, Pei Xiang, both Nascent Soul cultivators overseeing the realm.

In reality, Xu Huan's wife had another senior brother known for his cunning and hidden identity, Chai Bofu, also known as Long Bo, a wild cultivator with an unpredictable presence. He was old and powerful, especially skilled in water techniques, able to go toe-to-toe with Liu Zhimiao from Shujian Lake. In a bid to seize a true scripture for crossing rivers, he had nearly lost his life.
This person was exceedingly arrogant, especially skilled in deception. Throughout the history of the Treasure Bottle Continent, he had appeared in various forms and identities in many places. Chai Bofu indeed had the substantial backing to be proud, given that very few cultivators in the Treasure Bottle Continent could claim to have fought Liu Zhimao, Liu Lao Cheng, and Li Tuanjing in succession, and still be alive and well today. The white jade belt adorned with a dragon pattern that hung from his waist, laden with a large array of jade pendants and jars, was more for show than anything else. The real trump card was that white jade belt, which was, in fact, a slumbering little dragon obtained from the ruins of the ancient Shu Kingdom’s fairy estate. It was because of this fortuitous encounter that he had developed a deadly enmity with Liu Lao Cheng. Chai Bofu even dared to ambush several direct descendants of the Palace Willow Island’s ancestral hall, showing his audacity and ruthlessness, along with his many means of self-preservation.

Xü Hùn found it easy to win against him, but killing him would be another story. Chai Bofu had secretly met with his wife multiple times and even took the liberty of passing on teachings to his legitimate son, Xü Bin Xian. In truth, Xü Hùn had considered killing him. This well-known rogue cultivator, known by the title of Long Bo, was actually a legitimate sect brother to his wife. The two had once conspired together to kill their master, each taking what they needed and escaping their sect. However, both of their masters were not good individuals either. In the end, Chai Bofu completely embraced the path of a wandering rogue, while his sister-in-arms married into Qingfeng City.

If it weren't for the water techniques that Chai Bofu passed on, which greatly benefited Xü Bin Xian's path to enlightenment, Xü Hùn would never have turned a blind eye to him.

Moreover, Chai Bofu was practically an honorary guest of Qingfeng City. For example, during one of Xü Hùn’s closed-door retreats, a disturbance had erupted in the Fox Kingdom, and Chai Bofu played a significant role in mitigating the chaos. Otherwise, by the time Xü Hùn emerged from his retreat, the Fox Kingdom would have been left in utter disarray.

The woman nodded, saying, “Senior brother has always been cautious. Ever since we parted ways to cultivate on our own, I haven’t seen his true face again until we reunited in Qingfeng City.”

In truth, the Long Bo who had been following Liu Chicheng hadn’t considered leaving clues for Qingfeng City to seek help, as there was no need to rely on Liu Chicheng to act blind. Twice, they were caught red-handed by Gu Can.

As for the consequences, it was easy to imagine. Falling into the hands of Gu Can, who resembled a more ferocious rogue than Chai Bofu, would certainly be far worse than falling into Liu Chicheng’s hands. So, during the subsequent journey across the continent, that Long Bo had nearly taken to lying low and playing dead. “Liu Chicheng and Gu Can, you two miserable brothers, either kill me, Chai Bofu, and be done with it, or whatever loss of realm is nothing to us. As cultivators, isn’t rising through the ranks just a means to face setbacks?”

Xü Hùn suddenly asked, “Setting aside the truth of the content, based solely on the description in this travelogue, where is this Chen Ping An now and what is his realm like?”

The Xü family woman softly replied, “At Pingzhu Lake, or perhaps Shujian Lake, Chen Ping An indeed served as a steward on Qingxia Island for a few years. At that time, his combat strength could roughly be equated to that of a Golden Core cultivator.”

Xü Hùn furrowed his brows, “A sword cultivator?”

The Xü family woman hesitated for a moment. “Whether to consider him a Golden Core sword cultivator is hard to say for now. However, this young man is quite deep in schemes, good at hiding his talents. Such a character is definitely not someone to be underestimated. Back then, I felt he was even more problematic than Liu Xianyang. It’s just that the people from Zhengyang Mountain were too overconfident, especially that old guardian monkey who looked down on anyone who had severed ties with the Bridge of Eternal Life, unwilling to eliminate the threat completely.”

“Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island is now a Golden Core cultivator. It seems that Luo Po Mountain holds him in high regard, which might give us some insight into the foundation of Luo Po Mountain, but it's highly likely it’s all a smokescreen deliberately created by them. The only confirmed news is that a few years ago, Luo Po Mountain had a conflict with the Water God’s estate at Yuyue River. In the end, it seems that Pi Yun Mountain was quite displeased with this matter, and Wei Ban, using his influence from the mountain’s bureaucracy, has since placed considerable pressure on the Water God’s estate. I heard that during a banquet of the city god in the state capital, the Water God of Chuan Dan River, Li Jin, let slip that there is a purely martial artist stationed at the peak of Luo Po Mountain, a master who is expected to reach the realm of great travel, responsible for teaching the younger generation martial arts. As for the Water Goddess of Yuyue River, she has also harbored quite a bit of resentment towards Luo Po Mountain in private, claiming that without the protection of Lord Wei from Pi Yun Mountain, she would surely suffer some losses in her merits, and might even flood Luo Po Mountain.”

Xü Bin Xian suddenly interjected with a laugh, “What if these two river gods, along with that city god of Longzhou, have already been bought off by Luo Po Mountain, deliberately putting on a show for us? Wouldn’t that mean we in Qingfeng City, who boast the ten sword immortals of Zhengyang Mountain, have been going in circles?”

The woman chuckled, “That old monkey has a point. In just over twenty years, a young man who severed ties with the Bridge of Eternal Life, even if he encounters many fortuitous opportunities and smooth sailing on his cultivation path, how formidable can he truly become? We can worry as much as we like, but scaring ourselves is pointless. Going in circles? If that travelogue is even fifty to sixty percent true, then the master of Luo Po Mountain has been wandering aimlessly on the Treasure Bottle Continent like a headless fly, wanting both tangible benefits and false reputations, and to engage in romantic encounters. He desires everything, but on the road, he can’t bear to give anything up. Such a person’s path to greatness is bound to be limited.”

“No matter what, our priority is for Qingfeng City to rise to a sect status,” she added.

Xü Hùn fixed his gaze upon her, and even though he had set up restrictions, he still communicated with her through thought, “Beyond this, over in the Fox Kingdom, Pei Xiang, there are matters I never inquire about, but that doesn’t mean I’m ignorant. Before this great war, any Yuanying cultivator on the Treasure Bottle Continent is precious. Given that you are under someone else's roof, Pei Xiang wouldn’t be so wary of a mere Longmen cultivator like you!”

The woman’s complexion turned pale.

Xü Hùn waved his hand dismissively. “I only care about the outcome, not the process.”

Upon returning to a tranquil courtyard on Zhengyang Mountain, the old ancestor of the Tao family immediately cast his supernatural powers to isolate the surroundings.

The white-clad old monkey escorted Tao Zi to this place before leaving on his own.

As the only guardian offering of Zhengyang Mountain, his status was revered; even the old sword immortal of the Tao family, who held a prominent position in the ancestral hall, had to treat him with respect. Moreover, everyone on Zhengyang Mountain knew how much this white-clad old monkey doted on Tao Zi, practically serving as the guardian for the Tao family’s lineage. Naturally, the Tao family’s old ancestor felt quite pleased about this.

Tao Zi had transformed from the little girl who first traveled to the Li Zhu Cave Heaven into a graceful young woman. As the white-clad old monkey took his leave, she had just seated herself but quickly got up again to accompany him to the gate of the courtyard. The sturdy old monkey patted Tao Zi’s head, signaling her not to be so courteous. The girl’s autumn-like eyes curved into crescent moons as she looked at the grandfather monkey who had protected her since childhood, feeling a heartfelt closeness, treating him as a family elder. There were many things she might not even share with her own grandfather, yet she could speak freely with the monkey without any reservations.

Without the need for the Tao family’s old ancestor to “open the door,” the white-clad old monkey pushed open the mountain and water restrictions with one hand and walked away with large strides.

The old sword immortal of the Tao family had an inscrutable expression. Although he was fond of this guardian offering, this old monkey was an irreplaceable ally for their lineage, yet the old monkey was far too unrefined outside of Tao Zi, showing no regard for human affairs whatsoever.

After the white-clad old monkey left, Tao Zi returned to her seat and said with a light laugh, “Once grandfather monkey successfully breaks through, he will surely have an additional share of celestial fortune; that’s a wonderful thing.”

The Tao family’s old ancestor smiled and nodded.

For instance, Liu Lao Cheng was the only wild cultivator on Treasure Bottle Continent to reach the fifth realm. In the dark, luck surrounded him, shielding the path to greatness. He had indeed become the chief offering of the True Realm Sect, rumored to have stepped into the realm of immortality, just a matter of time before he catches up with the great heavenly lord Qi Zhen. Wei Jin from Fengxue Temple seemed to be an excellent example of someone who monopolized the luck of the sword path. Looking back, it seemed that Li Tuanjing, who had been troubled by love for hundreds of years, had indeed squandered his fortune, failing to cherish his blessings. Otherwise, had Li Tuanjing broken through the bottleneck of Yuanying, he would have undoubtedly become the first native sword immortal of the Treasure Bottle Continent. However, if that were to happen, it would be Zhengyang Mountain that would suffer. The so-called ten paths to peak swordsmanship would only become the greatest joke of the Treasure Bottle Continent.

Otherwise, Li Tuanjing would only need to ascend alone, riding his sword to the peak of Zhengyang Mountain. At that time, who would dare to go up and die?

The white-clad old monkey intended to go to the highest point of the mountain’s divine shrine to enjoy the view.

Outside the wall at the foot of the Deer Ming Mansion, Chun Qing asked, “What do you mean?”

Cui Dongshan immediately stood up and said seriously, “Since we can’t fight against it, we can only avoid its sharp edges!”

The two slipped away together.

In a scenic pavilion at the cliff’s edge, Chun Qing stood on tiptoe, gazing into the distance, where dust swirled and yellow sand roared like a tide approaching. Chun Qing frowned and said, “The barbaric lands are going to disrupt the Southern Yue battle formation. Those wind-guarding cultivators you arranged in Da Li might not be able to completely fend off the opposing forces.”

Cui Dongshan stood on the railing, his gaze sweeping over the enormous beasts revealing their true forms among the demon race, most of which were at the Earth Immortal realm, while some were naturally large mountainous demons. However, what was truly troublesome was a remnant of an ancient deity dragging shimmering glass-like light in the far distance. Even Cui Dongshan wouldn’t dare to claim he could stop its advance. A battle involving the mountain cultivators and the iron cavalry below was crucially about mutual dominance; no existing entity could be an exception. For instance, if Cui Dongshan were to appear on the battlefield, he would inevitably attract targeted attacks from sword immortals like Shou Chen, just as previously, when the Scarlet Concubine had struck, using her innate divine powers to cause a tidal wave to crash upon Old Dragon City, the Treasure Bottle Continent had a figure like Wang Zhu reveal his true form to counter her, neutralizing most of her water techniques. Earlier, Bai Ye had defended against the sword of Fuyou Island, representing the largest exception. Therefore, Wen Hai would choose to encircle and eliminate Bai Ye, no matter the cost. Before this, Bai Ye had beheaded the throne of the Sun Armor, and the Sun Armor in turn had killed Zhou Shen Zhi; it was all about this principle.

In a war that affected the trends of the world, no matter if one was a Ascended realm cultivator or even a great cultivator of the Fourteenth Realm, no one could truly turn the tide once it had fallen.

What could truly determine the victory or defeat on the battlefield was still the hearts of the people. Only the hearts of the people were the real trend. Mountain immortals, iron cavalry below, border troops, generals and ministers, martial artists of the rivers and lakes, common folk, none could be missing.

Chun Qing subconsciously extended her two fingers, lightly twisting her green robe. “In this way, the demon race will suffer greatly while paying a hefty price, but as long as they disrupt the large military formation at the foot of Southern Yue Mountain, the barbaric lands will still profit.”

Cui Dongshan laughed, “Old Wang still has some tricks up his sleeve.”

The white-clad old monkey did not encounter the white-clad youth and the green-robed girl; instead, he went alone to the mountaintop and ended up seeing three pure martial artists, one of whom was a young woman, looking slightly concerned, standing alone and gazing towards the southern battlefield.

One person, the white-clad old monkey recognized, was Li Er from the old Li Zhu Cave Heaven, rumored to have once fought with Song Changjing.

As for the other two, the white-clad old monkey did not recognize them.

Disguised as Zheng Qian, Pei Qian, and the oldest martial artist from Beiju Lu Continent, who had once gone mad, Wang Fuxu.

The white-clad old monkey scoffed. Was a Ninth Realm martial artist that remarkable?

As for the young woman with the flickering gaze, was she at the Golden Body realm? Or was she one of those who kept her cards close to her chest in the realm of great travel? She seemed to be a knife-wielding girl?

Li Er turned his head.

The white-clad old monkey chose to ignore him.

Wang Fuxu clicked his tongue and said, “Li Er, Zheng Qian, someone isn’t giving you two any face. If we were back in Beiju Lu Continent, what the hell is asking for a fight worth?”

“Someone?” Li Er asked.

Finally, the white-clad old monkey turned his head.

However, the moment he did, his expression suddenly changed, becoming stormy and unpredictable.

He no longer had time to squabble with a brash person like Li Er.

Because at that moment, the aura of an entire continent shifted abruptly as a towering armored deity rose, carrying the martial luck of the entire Treasure Bottle Continent. Its ethereal form swiftly traversed from the capital of Da Li to the territory of Southern Yue, stepping on the void and drifting southward.

Cui Dongshan stood there dumbfounded, then suddenly began cursing Cui Chan as a bastard, wondering how one could be invincible with such a head start in a chess game. “Stupid chess basket, get the hell out of here! If you dare jump up in front of me, I’ll slap you right in the face…”

Chun Qing was left bewildered, but she quickly learned the reason.

It turned out that another vaguely familiar scholar had emerged from the Qi Du Shrine, dressed in a green shirt. At first, he appeared no different from an ordinary person, but with a single step, he covered half the continent in an instant, suddenly towering over ten thousand feet and directly appearing at the ruins of the old Dragon City, pressing down on the ancient high-ranking deity’s head with one hand, smiling as he said, “When in doubt, ask me for spring wind.”
