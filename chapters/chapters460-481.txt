 ### Chapter 460: All Matters Favorable, No Taboos

He drew a large circle at the dock.

Then he bent down within the circle and slowly drew a straight line, effectively dividing the circle into two halves.

Chen Ping’an squatted beside that line, remaining motionless for a long time, his brow furrowed in deep thought.

The weary accountant had no choice but to take down the sword-raising gourd from his waist and sip some crow’s call wine to revive himself.

Only then did he write the words "good" and "evil" above and below that straight line.

Tonight, Chen Ping’an intended to take a step forward on the character "one," which he had once paused at on his path of introspection, unwilling to delve deeper and feeling powerless to explore further.

It was like the young man in straw sandals from Mud Bottle Alley, walking atop the corridor bridge years ago.

Chen Ping’an squatted on the ground, between the words “good” and “evil,” lightly inscribing the phrase “people-oriented” and murmured, “For now, this is all I can think of.”

He closed his eyes, took another sip of wine, and upon reopening them, stood up and walked briskly to the edge of the semicircle labeled "good." Without hesitation, he drew a diagonal line towards the other segment of the "evil" semicircle, then stepped forward and drew another diagonal line from the bottom up.

In the end, he had divided the circle into six segments, with the only intersection being the single point at the center.

After this, it seemed as if a light bulb had gone off in Chen Ping’an's mind. He quickly moved to the central area of the “good” semicircle. With a charcoal pencil in hand, he began to write rapidly, talking to himself, “If this represents the pure and steadfast heart inclined towards goodness, then the people in this realm, regardless of their teachings—whether from the Three Teachings or the Hundred Schools—would embrace the best knowledge. Even those who have never read a word would understand that ‘there are golden houses in books, and grain in thousands of bushels,’ and ‘cultivating oneself, managing one’s family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world’—that is the best knowledge, for they are willing to listen and learn without needing to be lectured by any sage. No matter how tough the world becomes, they will steadfastly hold onto their true hearts!”

Chen Ping’an quickly rose, stepping back to the central area of the “evil” semicircle, which faced the charcoal-written area of “good.”

He squatted down again, scribbling with the charcoal pencil, murmuring, “Human nature is inherently evil. This evil is not merely negative; it reveals another aspect of human nature, which is to instinctively perceive the ‘one’ in this world—to compete, to snatch, to maximize one’s own interests. Unlike the former, who can entrust their life and death to Confucian teachings like the Three Unfading Principles, here, ‘I’ am the entire universe; if I die, the universe dies with me; if I live, the universe thrives. The individual ‘I,’ this small ‘one,’ holds equal weight to the vast universe, the great ‘one.’ This is why Zhu Lian explained why he was unwilling to sacrifice one person to save the world—it is this principle! This is not a condemnation; it is merely the essence of human nature. Although I have not witnessed it firsthand, I believe it has once driven the world’s progression.”

“Those whose hearts are entirely ‘blooming and bearing fruit’ can, at crucial moments, utter lines like ‘After my death, let the floods rise’ or ‘I would rather betray the world’ or ‘As the sun sets and the road ahead is long, I will act in defiance.’ However, this nature, which seems to be shared by all living things, may very well be the foundation of our existence as ‘humans,’ at least one of them. This explains why I previously found it hard to comprehend how so many ‘evil’ individuals can cultivate to become immortals without hindrance, even living better than so-called good people. Because the universe nurtures all living things without bias, it is not necessarily defined by the goodness or evil of ‘humans.’”

After taking a big gulp of wine, Chen Ping’an moved to the far right side of the upper semicircle. “Here, the people's hearts are not as steadfast as those nearby; they are more fickle. However, they still lean towards goodness. Yet, they can easily change based on people, place, or time, leading to various transformations. This is where the teachings of the Three Sages and the Hundred Schools come into play, tirelessly reminding us that ‘jade must be carved to become a gem, and one must learn to know,’ cautioning with ‘humans act; the heavens observe,’ and encouraging that ‘merit in this life brings blessings in the next, and suffering in this life brings merit in the next.’”

After writing this, Chen Ping’an pondered further and approached the area near the center, where the words “good” and “evil” were inscribed. He slowly added two more phrases with his charcoal pencil—writing above, “Willing to believe that life on earth is not merely a matter of ‘bartering,’” and below, “If there is any giving without substantial return, it incurs a loss to the benefit of ‘I’ as one.”

Chen Ping’an put away the charcoal pencil, murmuring, “Once one perceives a loss, an immense doubt and anxiety arise within the depths of their heart, prompting them to look around, thinking they must reclaim from elsewhere and even demand more. This explains the chaos at Shujian Lake, where everyone struggles and strives. It also clarifies why so many people must react with force in various aspects of life after being hit hard in one area, disregarding the lives of others. It is not merely to survive, just like Gu Can, who, despite living well, would still follow this path, becoming someone who could say, ‘I enjoy killing.’ This is not solely due to the environment of Shujian Lake but also because the fields of Gu Can's heart are divided in this way. When he had an opportunity to touch upon a greater world—for instance, when I gifted him the little loach and he arrived at Shujian Lake—he would naturally seek to seize more from others, money, lives, at any cost.”

Chen Ping’an then moved to the far left of the upper semicircle. “Here, the people's hearts are most chaotic; they want to do good but don’t know how, and they may wish to do evil but lack the courage. Hence, they easily feel that ‘studying is useless’ and ‘principles mislead me.’ Although they reside in this semicircle, they can easily tumble into evil. This has created so many ‘hypocritical scoundrels’ in the world. Even the Buddha in the scriptures worries about the arrival of the end of the Dharma. The individuals here flow with the tides of life, living in great hardship, possibly the most difficult of all. I previously conversed with Gu Can about how the beauty of the world’s principles and the true freedom of the strong lie in their ability to protect this group of people, so they need not worry about those in the central region of the lower semicircle. Due to the latter’s rampant disregard for the rules, they suffer from numerous unprovoked disasters, fearing that all the wealth they have painstakingly accumulated would vanish overnight, allowing these individuals to live well even without needing to explain their principles. Even their occasional unreasonable behavior doesn’t significantly shake the stable wooden chair built by Confucian teachings; they can still live well.”

Chen Ping’an stood up and moved to the corresponding area of the lower semicircle on the far right, slowly writing, “Here, if you tell them to put down the butcher’s knife and become a Buddha on the spot, or that knowing one’s mistakes can lead to great improvement, it is destined to be mere empty talk.”

Even though a large blank space still remained on the far left of the lower semicircle, Chen Ping’an’s face had turned pale, showing signs of exhaustion. After taking another large gulp of wine, he swayed and stood up. The piece of charcoal in his hand had been worn down to the size of a fingernail. Chen Ping’an steadied himself, but his fingers trembled, and he could not write anymore. Taking a deep breath, he raised his arm to wipe the sweat from his forehead, wanting to squat down to continue writing, even if it was just one more word. However, as he bent over, he unexpectedly plopped down onto the ground.

Chen Ping’an casually placed the sword-raising gourd on the ground with one hand while the other opened its fingers, letting the remaining piece of charcoal roll away. He lay back, staring up at the dock.

“The Confucians propose the heart of compassion, and the Buddhists advocate for the heart of mercy. Yet, it remains difficult for us to achieve this in this world, let alone maintain such ideals at all times. Rather, the ‘innocent heart’ first spoken by the sub-saint and the Daoist ancestor’s notion of ‘returning to simplicity, reverting to the infant’ seem to resonate more…”

With great effort, Chen Ping’an stood up, stepping out of the incomplete circle of charcoal. He fixed his gaze on the large circle, ultimately focusing on the central area where he had first written the words “good” and “evil.”

Chen Ping’an swayed slightly, extending a hand as if to grasp the entire circle.

He was almost unaware of what he was saying.

In this moment, he had forgotten all about his physical form.

“Is it possible to not even discuss good and evil? To only speak of the difference between divine and human? The essence? Otherwise, this circle would still be difficult to substantiate.”

“This requires… to elevate? Rather than being bound by the principles laid out in books, or to limit ourselves to Confucian teachings, should we not simply expand this circle? Or rather, should we elevate it a bit?”

“If so, then I understand—it’s not as I previously deduced; it’s not that the principles of the world have thresholds, distinguishing levels. Instead, it is a matter of moving around this circle and continually observing; it is the heart’s nature that differentiates. This does not imply that the hearts of people in different places have a hierarchy or a stark contrast. Thus, the Three Teachings and their sages, the influence of their work, is to move the hearts of people across different territories to the areas they wish to reach.”

“If we do not look upward first, and refrain from walking in circles on flat ground, but instead use sequence to step back and observe, without discussing various innate hearts, merely acknowledging the true essence of the world, the Confucian teachings aim to expand and solidify the ‘material’ realm, while Daoism seeks to elevate this world, enabling us humans to rise above all other sentient beings.”

Chen Ping’an closed his eyes and took out a bamboo slip inscribed with words full of melancholy yet beautifully poignant from a great Confucian. At the time, he thought the idea was strange yet insightful. Today, it seems that as one delves deeper, it contains some true Daoist essence: “A basin of water covers the ground, and a mustard seed floats on the water. An ant clings to the mustard seed, believing it is trapped. Only when the water dries up does it realize the path is clear, and there is nowhere it cannot go.”

“The Daoist pursuit is for us, as humans, not to exist with hearts as low as ants but to seek a higher perspective on the world, to stand apart from the animals and plants of the world.”

“What about Buddhism…”

Chen Ping’an extended both hands, drawing a circle, “Combining the expansiveness of Confucianism with the elevation of Daoism, uniting the ten directions of the world without omission.”

Finally, Chen Ping’an murmured, “That ‘one’—do I finally understand it a little?”

With a loud thud, the exhausted accountant fell backward, closing his eyes, his face wet with tears. He wiped his face with one hand, lifted a palm slightly, and through the mist of his tears, he muttered, half-asleep and half-awake, his spirit utterly drained yet with a deep sense of satisfaction, “Who decorates the sky when the clouds disperse and dawn breaks? The sea’s hue and the sky’s appearance are inherently clear.”

Chen Ping’an closed his eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep, a smile on his lips as he softly murmured, “So it turns out, if we do not differentiate between good and evil in people’s hearts, even this can bring a smile.”

As Chen Ping’an lay generously on the dock at Shujian Lake, having drawn a large circle and left a charcoal mark unfinished, he drifted into a deep, sweet slumber.

Unbeknownst to him, at some point, a carefree young man in a blue shirt and a captivating girl in a blue dress with a ponytail arrived at the dock almost simultaneously.

The two exchanged no words, nor did their gazes meet.

The scholar who had not penned a response at the Taiping Mountain Patriarch Hall but had come to a foreign land personally picked up the piece of charcoal Chen Ping’an had dropped. He squatted at the far left of the circle, hesitating to write but not feeling regret. Instead, his eyes sparkled with mirth, “With the mountains ahead, must this former gentleman of the academy take a detour?”

Meanwhile, the girl in blue stood outside the circle at one end of the straight line, munching on new pastries from the green phoenix city by Shujian Lake, mumbling indistinctly, “It still lacks a bit of clarity on the distinction between the divine and the human. It hasn’t been fully articulated.”

The scholar held the piece of charcoal, raised his head, looked around, and exclaimed, “What a situation, where one must dare to face thousands of difficulties! What a moment, where one’s heart is bold, even when intoxicated!”

The girl in blue commented, “With a pure heart, all principles are clear.”

Only then did he turn his gaze towards the girl, who was nibbling on her pastry, and said, “Don’t take advantage of Chen Ping’an while he’s fast asleep. But if you insist on doing so, I, Zhong Kui, can turn my back; this is what we call a gentleman’s act of benevolence!”

At this, she finally looked at him, puzzled, “You’re called Zhong Kui? You’re quite… peculiar. I can’t quite understand you.”

Zhong Kui gestured with his hand over his shoulder towards the snoring accountant, “This fellow understands me, which is why I came.”

Zhong Kui gazed at Shujian Lake, which appeared entirely different in his eyes compared to the rest of the world, muttering, “How can it be that only I, Zhong Kui, am a gentleman? What a vast cesspool this world is!”

Ruan Xiu’s expression remained calm, “I know you want to help him, but I advise you not to stay and assist; it will only complicate things.”

Zhong Kui asked, “Really?”

Ruan Xiu countered, “Do you trust me?”

Zhong Kui nodded.

Ruan Xiu finished her pastry, dusted off her hands, and left.

Zhong Kui pondered for a moment, gently placed the small piece of charcoal back in its original spot, and after standing up, he wrote in midair, leaving behind just eight characters at Shujian Lake. Then he too departed, heading back to Tongye Continent.

No longer the gentleman of the academy, Zhong Kui arrived joyfully and left joyfully.

The eight characters he left behind were: “All matters favorable, no taboos.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 461: Regrets?

Inside the towering buildings of Pool Water City.

As the Grand Master of the Great Li Kingdom, Cui Zhan had already set aside three communication flying swords tonight, each left unattended.

Cui Dongshan walked along the edge of the golden thunder pool, his hands clasped behind his back as he slowly pondered aloud, “What is the significance of what Zhong Kui has written? What exactly has Ruan Xiu discerned?”

Cui Zhan brushed off Cui Dongshan with two rhetorical questions, “Do you think I’m a Dao Ancestor? The ultimate truth revealed through calculations requires a vast amount of information to be gathered. Is that basic knowledge so elusive to you?”

Cui Dongshan retorted, “Boring! I was just trying to chat, but you take it so seriously.”

Cui Zhan received another extremely discreet communication flying sword, which, like all the previous ones, did not soar in from above the territory of Shujian Lake but instead manifested within the tall building. A spring appeared, and water flowed gently from it, from which the flying sword emerged before the spring vanished.

This was naturally one of the highest military secrets of the Great Li, the result of extensive effort from the Li Mo disciples, as well as an astonishing amount of heavenly currency.

Yet, Cui Zhan still did not open the flying sword. He spoke slowly, “Focusing on humanity, and without discussing ghosts and spirits, a sage of the academy stationed in a continent must possess a certain height of understanding, then consider the world and think about matters beyond ‘humanity.’ This transcends the learning of a gentleman, who only needs to benefit a nation and then seek to govern a continent. Therefore, a gentleman's foundation lies with humanity.”

Cui Zhan continued, “Chen Ping'an’s conception of the boundaries of this circle, without discussing academic matters, is quite significant. The rest, in comparison to the Grand General Wei Liang of Qingluan Kingdom, who proposed that the laws of the world must be based on humanity, shares a similar essence. This implies that all mountain spirits and ghosts regard human laws as inapplicable.”

Cui Dongshan asked, “So you consider Wei Liang, a disciple of the Legalists, to be half a comrade?”

Cui Zhan nodded, “Before reaching the end of the road, it is indeed a case of different paths leading to the same destination, and it can complement the theories of meritocracy.”

Cui Zhan turned his head and smiled, “By the way, why didn’t you ask me to help conceal the ferry's weather? Aren’t you afraid of attracting unnecessary attention?”

Cui Dongshan continued his pacing around the golden thunder pool, casually replying, “No need. After all, it’s something we both can understand, not to mention the height the old scholar reached when he participated in the debates of the Three Teachings back in the day. Chen Ping'an's knowledge is not frightening. What truly terrifies is the old scholar's words that shattered the Buddha's true form and the Daoist's pure heart.”

Cui Zhan seemed to agree with this assertion. “Chen Ping'an stands at half a mountain’s height, holding up a lantern that flickers, casting a faint light on the path beneath his feet. We are not included; our influence is minimal. It is a pity that only Zhong Kui and Ruan Xiu have witnessed this.”

Cui Dongshan paused, glancing at the landscape painting unfurled on the ground before Cui Zhan, sneering, “Others who see it merely find it bothersome and completely fail to understand it. It’s better that they grasp only half of it. It’s the leftmost side of the upper half that makes them increasingly uneasy. Such is the nature of the world and human hearts; Chen Ping'an can see through it all. Gu Can, that housekeeper disciple from Qingxia Island—what do you think will happen if they see it? They will only become more frustrated. Thus, life’s joys and sorrows are destined; at least half of that is true. Those destined to roll in the mud will remain so all their lives. Those who glimpse a bit of light will naturally claw their way out of the muck, shedding their filth and transforming from a clumsy, mud-caked fool into a graceful gentleman at heart, like Lu Baixiang.”

Cui Zhan’s expression remained calm and relaxed.

For the “old fox and the young fox,” who originally came from the same person yet had their souls separated, this casual exchange was laced with a tacit understanding, seemingly intent on downplaying the height and significance of Chen Ping'an's ferry circle.

The two fell silent after this.

Cui Zhan began to open the four communication flying swords one by one.

Due to the tremendous amount of heavenly currency required to “navigate through the cracks of time,” the messages on each sword were often brief and to the point.

This was also one of the outcomes of Cui Zhan’s focus on managing bureaucratic redundancies after becoming the Grand Master of the Great Li.

He aimed to communicate in a way that the civil officials and military generals of the Great Li could all “understand.”

Cui Zhan appeared to be busy handling urgent state affairs.

Cui Dongshan, guided by an intuitive spark, silently repeated a phrase in his mind, something the old scholar once said in private discussions with a wandering Buddhist disciple, a phrase that could be termed a “grand statement.”

“My heart is bright; what more needs to be said?”

After Cui Zhan methodically dealt with all military and political matters, he replied to each in turn.

Then, Cui Zhan sat quietly, diving deep into meditation. Within his mind, the “Cui Zhan” Nascent Soul sat cross-legged in his core, twisting the trajectory of the straight line representing the ferry circle, transforming it into the yin-yang fish diagram painted by the Dao Ancestor in the mortal realm long ago.

He waved his hand, lightly pushing this circle aside, and looked back at the original circle, witnessing it divided into six territories. The six segments reminded him of Chen Ping'an's earlier mention that one should not look down from a high place but instead circle around. This meant there was only a division between left and right, shifting mountains and seas, transmuting human hearts—this was called the ceaseless cycle!

Cui Zhan's Nascent Soul grew increasingly cold as he gazed.

Suddenly, Cui Zhan withdrew his consciousness, opened his eyes, and with a swift motion of his fingers within his sleeve, he initiated a spell with the character "Yao" as the starting point.

At a certain moment thereafter…

“Cui Dongshan!”

“Cui Zhan!”

The old and the young called out each other’s names almost simultaneously.

Cui Dongshan quickly produced the time-traveling diagram he had once shown to Pei Qian and laid it out on the ground.

Cui Zhan swiftly approached the edge of the golden thunder pool and said in a deep voice, “Only extract the images related to the person surnamed Yao at the Longyao kiln! All of them!”

Cui Dongshan, furious and embarrassed, retorted, “That old man Yang is even more of a bastard than you! He must have deliberately concealed all the tracks of the Yao kiln, pulling the wool over our eyes. Our previous deductions were half-hearted at best and have led us straight into a cesspool! Damn it! This must be some kind of deal between Old Yang and Yao! Cui Zhan, we must not be made to wear someone else’s clothes; I, Cui Zhan, might be crushed to death by Confucianism or the weight of the world, but I absolutely refuse to die a fool’s death!”

In his urgency, Cui Dongshan didn’t even care about his slip of the tongue, mistakenly calling himself “Cui Zhan.”

The more he thought about it, the more frantic he became, and he began to curse loudly, “Is Qi Jingchun blind?! Isn’t he strong enough at chess to make the City Lord of White Emperor City see him as a rival? In the first fifty-nine years of the Li Pearl Cave, if we don’t mention it, Qi Jingchun would only be disappointed. But after he decided to pin his most significant disappointment on Chen Ping'an, why hasn’t he done anything? Just letting it be, turning a blind eye?! I say, the Buddhist sect, as the one collecting the three-thousand-year rent from Li Pearl Cave, cannot be so simple! Perhaps that ascetic is just a diversion!”

Compared to Cui Dongshan’s frantic outburst, Cui Zhan remained calm and asked, “What were the actual names of those two flying swords in Chen Ping'an's possession before they were named ‘First Day’ and ‘Fifteenth’?”

Cui Dongshan frowned, “I only know that the sword named ‘First Day’ was given to Chen Ping'an by the old scholar after a crack appeared in the old scholar’s landscape painting. The second sword, ‘Fifteenth,’ was a worthless trinket that Old Yang, that old bastard who has lived almost as long as that foul bull-nosed man, gave to Chen Ping'an as a trade. Old Yang claimed it was called ‘Fifteenth,’ clearly a name he spat out just to follow Chen Ping'an's renaming of ‘First Day’.”

Cui Zhan lowered his head, focusing on the segments extracted from the time-traveling diagram using a secret method.

Cui Dongshan pointed outside the building, cursing, “Is Qi Jingchun blind? Has the old scholar gone mad too?”

Cui Zhan replied calmly, “Who has gone to such lengths to have Chen Ping'an study Buddhist scriptures?”

Cui Dongshan spat towards the edge of the golden thunder pool, aiming at Cui Zhan’s head, “Get lost! If you’re the one who set this trap to harm us both, I would rather die than let Chen Ping'an read the classics of the Three Teachings and the Hundred Schools!”

Cui Zhan didn’t lift his head, waving his sleeve to send the spit back to Cui Dongshan’s face.

Cui Dongshan wiped his face casually, still fuming and cursing at the heavens.

After reviewing the images regarding Chen Ping'an's mention of that “Old Yao” for the second time, Cui Zhan said softly, “Don’t forget, there’s also that ‘Yao’ character locust leaf that Qi Jingchun helped obtain. With so many locust leaves on that locust tree, why did only this one fall? Let’s extract this segment of the time-traveling diagram and see.”

Cui Dongshan complied.

When it came to important matters, Cui Dongshan was never coy or pretentious.

On the painting, after Qi Jingchun obtained the only locust leaf willing to leave its branch for Chen Ping'an, he had quietly turned to gaze at the highest point of the locust leaves, a mocking smile on his face.

Qi Jingchun only saw that one glance.

Yet it just so happened that many years later, when the two looked down upon the painting, the three of them seemed to be eyeing each other across a river of time.

A coincidence?

Or was it intentional?

Cui Dongshan felt a shiver run down his spine, while Cui Zhan’s face darkened.

Cui Dongshan murmured, “Is Qi Jingchun mocking the ancestors of those surnamed Locust for their blindness, or is he laughing at us for not guessing what he’s doing? Or is it both?”

Cui Zhan remained silent.

He slowly pondered and calculated this matter in his heart.

Cui Dongshan plopped down on the ground, howling, “What have we done? That old bastard, you’re more skilled than me, older, and have experienced more! Why don’t you say something? My heart feels stifled, like my teacher’s heart is now parched, almost unable to write at the ferry. I’m exhausted too; I can’t be bothered to curse you anymore.”

Cui Zhan feigned deafness.

Cui Dongshan scratched his head, “Life is hard; my teacher is worried, and so am I. We don’t share blessings but share burdens. It’s unbearable, just unbearable.”

Suddenly, Cui Zhan laughed, “You’re more afraid of Qi Jingchun than I am, so I know that, in fact, at the beginning of this predicament, you hoped Qi Jingchun was already dead. But now, have you changed your mind? Do you hope Qi Jingchun can come back again, haunting us?”

Cui Dongshan fell silent, feeling dejected.

Cui Zhan pointed at the time-traveling diagram, “Put it away. Overthinking is futile. Speculating on Qi Jingchun’s intentions is no longer meaningful.”

Cui Dongshan shuffled over to the diagram, slapped Qi Jingchun’s face on the painting, and still unsatisfied, slapped it twice more, “Is there anyone in the world who plots against their own senior brother like you do? Huh? Come on, if you have the guts, step out and speak. Let’s have a good debate…”

Cui Zhan remarked, “Aren’t you ashamed?”

Cui Dongshan angrily rolled up the time-traveling diagram.

Cui Zhan changed the subject, “Since you mentioned debate, do you remember the time we defeated the Buddhists and Daoists? The old scholar returned to the academy, and rather than being happy, he ended up drinking, reminiscing about those nameless common people in ancient texts who, when meeting the Sage of the Ancients, would dare to argue their own reasons without fear, laughing heartily when they realized they were wrong. I remember very clearly; when the old scholar spoke of this, his expression was more passionate than when he debated with the Buddhists and Daoists. Why is that?”

Cui Dongshan grumbled, “The old scholar’s heart is higher than the heavens!”

Cui Zhan asked a string of questions in one breath, “Why is it that now, reading and writing is easier compared to ancient times, yet people increasingly feel awed by the teachings and principles of the sages and saints? Why do Confucian students feel their knowledge can’t match the sages and that modern people are destined to be inferior to the ancients? Why, as knowledge increases in the world, does the mindset of later generations seem to shrink?”

Cui Dongshan sighed, “Perhaps it’s because as life gets better, we become increasingly dull towards this world, just like those once elevated gods.”

Cui Zhan squinted, “For us, as long as we survive the upcoming catastrophe, isn’t that a good thing?”

Cui Dongshan’s expression froze.

Cui Zhan sneered, “Regrets?”

Cui Dongshan trembled all over.

For the carefree, reckless youth in white, this was an unprecedented situation.

Cui Zhan suddenly stood up, “You’ve chosen a good teacher. Others, like the ninety-nine percent of the riffraff in Shujian Lake, even if tossed into the river of time in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, wouldn’t see any results for three hundred years, let alone three thousand years.”

Cui Dongshan asked in confusion, “What’s the point of saying this? Every time you say something nice, I get uneasy.”

Cui Zhan gazed out at the moonlit lake, “With the many affairs of the Great Li, I cannot afford to receive the most important communication flying swords daily here; it would delay our real matters. Unlike you, if Chen Ping'an cannot overcome this hurdle, you will be implicated, while I've already secured my position. Thus, the distinction between you and me is not without reason.”

Cui Dongshan didn’t seem surprised by Cui Zhan's departure and said nothing further.

His eyes were quietly moving.

Cui Zhan turned his back to Cui Dongshan, “I advise you to show some backbone and not think of doing anything sneaky while I’m away. If you do, I will be very disappointed.”

Sitting on the ground, Cui Dongshan lightly waved a sleeve, as if “sweeping the floor.”

Cui Zhan said, “While I’m still here, if you have any questions, ask quickly.”

Cui Dongshan didn’t hesitate and immediately asked, “Are you really going to let Liu Laocheng kill Gu Can? Aren’t you going to intervene?”

Cui Zhan shook his head, “It doesn’t matter much in relation to the deadlock. I’m not Chen Ping'an; why should I care about the life and death of a little brat? If Gu Can dies, Liu Laocheng still has to do business with us in the Great Li. It’s merely a matter of switching from Liu Zhimo to Liu Laocheng. Just look—the surnames are the same. In fact, this is better. Liu Zhimo couldn’t gather support, and the style of the wild cultivators at Shujian Lake is no different from the deceitful behavior of a decaying dynasty. It’s better to have Liu Laocheng in charge; he understands the larger trends. Our cooperation with the Great Li will be much smoother, rather than the likely entanglements with Liu Zhimo, who, after gaining benefits, might find himself powerless to act and become a turtle hiding its head, potentially giving Liu Zhimo an opportunity to raise prices. So even if Liu Laocheng becomes a ruler of the rivers and lakes and demands a higher price, the early losses for the Great Li will be inevitable, but in the long run, the Great Li can still recover.”

Cui Dongshan hurriedly asked again, “If—let’s say if—Qi Jingchun really becomes a persistent ghost, what will happen when you leave and he arrives?”

Cui Zhan replied, “I’ve naturally made contingency plans. In the shadows of Shujian Lake, just like at Li Pearl Cave, the Daoists have left a certain Lu Zhangjiao there. I’m not you; I do what I say. Don’t speculate. Once you cross the thunder pool and break the rules, I also have other contingency plans in place to deal with you.”

Cui Dongshan fell silent, this time making two sweeping motions with his sleeves.

Cui Zhan sighed, “The virtues and vices of man are like a mouse, determined by where they are. A mouse never knows that moving grain is stealing.”

He turned his head, smiling as he asked, “And what about us humans? If attaining Dao and achieving immortality means there exists an unknowable entity above us observing, what are we humans doing?”

Cui Dongshan murmured, “It’s something I’ve understood for a long time; why ask me? Isn’t it because we want to understand that we chose to do what we did? Therefore, among the four in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, the most interesting one, Zhu Lian, would watch from the sidelines and draw the correct conclusion, saying that you and I are the ones who see the omen of the abyssal fish.”

Cui Zhan laughed, “I’m afraid you’ll become the next Gu Can, with a poor memory.”

Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes.

Cui Zhan smiled, “For me and Qi Jingchun, Li Pearl Cave, Shujian Lake, both times were gentlemanly disputes.”

Cui Dongshan’s expression turned strange.

Cui Zhan said, “Your doubts imply that I, too, have had doubts about myself in the past. But now I tell you, it’s a gentlemanly dispute.”

Cui Dongshan asked again, “Qi Jingchun can watch Zhao Yao switch to other lineages since they are all within the Confucian school. Qi Jingchun can also leave three books for Song Jixin to elaborate on the essence of Legalism since the conflict between Confucianism and Legalism is not too heated. But what if Qi Jingchun pushes Chen Ping'an into Buddhism, and Chen Ping'an never looks back? What does that mean? Even if Qi Jingchun has contemplated Buddhism while stationed at Li Pearl Cave, I don’t believe he has truly escaped Zen; I’m absolutely convinced of that. So, what is Chen Ping'an to Qi Jingchun? Is he a little junior brother? Is he the protector of Li Baoping, Zhao Yao, and Song Jixin? Or is he the true heir of Qi Jingchun’s lineage?! Or is he simply nothing at all?”

Cui Zhan chuckled, “I don’t know.”

Cui Dongshan murmured, “You know.”

Cui Zhan, like an elder instructing a junior, said to Cui Dongshan, “Little brat, don’t say ‘I concede’ to others in the future. Once a person’s spirit is deflated, it’s easy to fall but difficult to rise. In a game of chess, if you concede in your heart, you just abandon the pieces on the board; who would openly admit defeat?”

Cui Dongshan felt disheartened, “Stop pointing fingers at me; we are no longer the same person.”

Cui Zhan didn’t put away the painting on the ground, leaving it for Cui Dongshan. He finally smiled, “At this moment, you should feel that my teacher is full of worries.”

Cui Dongshan didn’t refute but instead echoed, “From a distance, the green mountains look beautiful, but being in the mountains makes the roads difficult; there are even bandits among the mountains.”

Cui Zhan stepped forward, disappearing like passing through a door.

Once Cui Zhan confirmed he had truly left, Cui Dongshan raised his hands, rolled up his sleeves, and a chessboard along with two jars of colorful cloud seeds appeared before him.

Sitting upright, his expression solemn, he began to play a game of five-in-a-row.

 ### Chapter 462: Snow Should Be Falling Soon

Chen Ping'an hurriedly set off from the Great Li Dynasty around the autumn equinox, making his way to Shujian Lake.

Upon reaching the territory of Shujian Lake, he took a carriage to the lakeside city of Chishui. The scenery along the way was picturesque—a clear sky, pristine waters, and frost appearing at night, with trees transitioning from deep crimson to pale yellow.

Afterward, he met with Gu Can. Having witnessed the refreshing autumn scenery of the rivers and lakes from Qingxia Island, he noted that the dew began to thicken gradually. As the long nights grew colder in Shujian Lake, the winds carried a sense of desolation, and a thick mist enveloped the waters. Chen Ping'an visited Yunlou City and, with the help of a father and daughter pair, traveled to the borders of Shihai Kingdom. He saw the line that marked the territory and another landscape altogether—frost-covered grass and the silence of people in the villages to the south and north.

Returning to Qingxia Island, winter quietly settled in. The waters began to freeze, and the pheasants transformed into mirages over the vast waters.

During his travels across many islands, Chen Ping'an took some time to understand the historical changes and local customs of Shujian Lake. He even spent half a day on Jinzhi Island, hoping to witness the phenomenon of “wild chickens transforming into mirages,” but such sights were rare, relying entirely on luck—much like the time he had waited long to find the golden carp. Unable to afford to spend too much time on chance, he reluctantly left, feeling somewhat regretful.

One can’t live in despair forever; one must find ways to alleviate their worries.

Hoping to see the scene of pheasants entering the water, he also had such conversations with Hong Su, the innkeeper at Zhu Xian Mansion on Qingxia Island.

After arriving at Qingxia Island, Chen Ping'an rarely drank, occasionally enjoying a sip or two to refresh himself.

As the old year drew to a close, cold winds swirled around the withered branches, and birds flew swiftly.

Just as Chen Ping'an thought he would continue progressing slowly, with Mingliu Island in an uproar while he remained quiet and focused on his tasks, he figured that one day he would look up and see the willows beginning to turn yellow and the waters showing a fresh green hue.

Then, one day, everything changed.

No longer was there noise from Mingliu Island. Gu Can returned to the mountain gate with a small loach in tow. She found Chen Ping'an, who was deeply engrossed in studying a secret technique passed down by Wei Ban. She informed him that the situation had been decided. Among the opposing factions, the leaders of Qingzong, Tianmu, and Lizu Islands, who had previously clamored to send three or five representatives from each side to compete for the title of the Jianghu monarch, suddenly vanished without a trace overnight, just when Qingxia Island was about to agree to the proposal.

The situation took a sharp turn. The Lizu Island leader, trying to maintain order, personally sought out Liu Zhimo on Mingliu Island. After a secret discussion, they seemed to have reached an agreement.

Liu Zhimo ascended to the throne of the Jianghu monarch with ease. It was almost too easy, considering that many powerful cultivators from over ten affiliated islands, including his disciple Tian Hu Jun, were ready to engage in bloody battle. In such a brutal conflict, anyone could die. However, both Liu Zhimo and Gu Can knew they were safe, and everyone understood this, leading to little resentment—though dissatisfaction was certainly not absent. The situation was beyond their control.

One could imagine that even the True Monarch of the Jiang River was laughing in his sleep.

Upon hearing this news, Chen Ping'an did not feel relieved.

Some things were predictable, like how Lizu Island was likely a pawn of the Song family from the Great Li Dynasty, and the damage to Qingzong and Tianmu Islands was likely the handiwork of the national teacher Cui Zhan.

However, other matters were beyond his grasp. For instance, whether the Zhuying Dynasty had any backup plans. If they did, who would it involve? Would their thunderous strike to reverse the situation target Liu Zhimo, Gu Can, or the little loach? Or would they simply retreat? The Zhuying Dynasty, embroiled in turmoil along its borders, might very well abandon the “chicken rib” territory of Shujian Lake altogether.

Perhaps even the potential influence of Chen Ping'an on Qingxia Island was part of that embroidered tiger's calculations. This might be what they called making the most of resources.

Chen Ping'an could only hope that during this time, Gu Can would not recklessly venture out and should remain cautious of the Zhuying Dynasty's desperate counterattacks.

Gu Can nodded with a smile, acknowledging her awareness of the situation. Liu Zhimo had also cautioned her not to get carried away. Regardless of anyone’s drinking party, she should not attend. They just needed to wait a couple of months, and by then, even if she urinated at the gate of the ancestral hall of Qingzong or Tianmu Islands, no one would dare intervene. Thus, Liu Zhimo was particularly careful, even delaying the banquet to celebrate his ascension until the spring of the following year, fearing that by then, when Qingxia Island opened its grand water array, those coming to congratulate could be a mix of friends and foes, and if trouble arose, it would seriously injure Qingxia Island.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an and Gu Can were seated on small bamboo chairs, chatting casually.

In the depths of winter, birds had almost vanished from the lake, with only the occasional sighting.

It should be snowing soon.

After Gu Can left, Chen Ping'an moved to the wharf, lost in thought.

On that day, during dusk, he suddenly looked up from his writing desk and hurried to the window.

Outside Qingxia Island, an old cultivator hovered in the air, sneering, “I am Liu Lao Cheng, here to meet with Gu Can. All others, get lost. If not, no one will be left to collect your corpses.”

Before his words even settled, the old cultivator waved his sleeve, and golden paper talismans flew in a continuous arc, ultimately forming a large circle, as if tightening around the neck of Qingxia Island.

Next to him materialized a towering golden-bodied avatar, clad in a strange black flame armor. One hand wielded a massive axe, while the other held a seal named “Golden Fire Spirit Seal,” one of Liu Lao Cheng’s crucial life treasures. In the prosperous waters of Shujian Lake, he had used this fire-based life treasure to bring countless islands to their knees, leaving behind a sea of mourning and floating corpses.

The high-ranking barrier-breaking talismans continuously shrank the encirclement, embedding themselves within the mountain water formation of Qingxia Island. One by one, they shattered with a loud bang, creating large holes in the protective array. If not for the array's core, which was piled high with celestial coins, along with Tian Hu Jun and a few loyal followers desperately maintaining and repairing the array, it might have shattered in an instant. Even so, the entire island began to tremble, the spiritual energy in chaos.

This old cultivator, who had been absent from Shujian Lake for many years, wasted no time on unnecessary words.

The giant avatar beside Liu Lao Cheng swung its axe straight down, instantly shattering the supposedly indestructible protective array of Qingxia Island.

A black dot shot out from the Spring Court Mansion, revealing its true form in midair as it transformed into a massive dragon over three hundred feet long, crashing into the golden-bodied avatar of a Jade Purity Realm cultivator.

The dragon instantly coiled around the golden avatar, crashing down into Shujian Lake, stirring up towering waves.

The avatar did not fall back after the impact; instead, its feet rooted into the lakebed and slid back.

Since they were near Qingxia Island, the waters were not too deep. The flame-armored golden avatar stood firmly on the lakebed, with the water only up to its waist.

A seal smashed down hard onto the dragon's head.

No attempt was made to pull it out.

The avatar sent the dragon, which was far larger than itself, crashing directly into the lake, stepping on its head and swinging its axe down.

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled.

With such a large piece of glazed golden body fragment, he hadn’t been idle lately. He had been stuck at the Jade Purity Realm bottleneck for over two centuries. While he hadn’t yet entered the Celestial Realm, he was not far off!

Moreover, to deal with this Nascent Soul dragon, he had spent a significant amount of resources, using up ninety grains of Gu Yu coins for an endeavor that was not particularly cost-effective.

That was to invite a top-tier cultivator from the Upper Five Realms to inscribe a Daoist “truth” on that axe: “Shooting a tiger fails, re-practice your arrows; slaying a dragon is endless, sharpen your sword again!”

As for the “sharpen the sword” saying being applied to the giant axe, it seemed quite humorous, but these trivial matters held no significance for the wild cultivators.

As long as it worked!

Blood and flesh mingled.

The waters of Shujian Lake churned violently, boiling fiercely, with blood streaming from the dragon's wounds, filling the air with a nauseating stench.

However, the dragon was famous for its tough flesh and was not without combat power. After a desperate struggle, it managed to flip the golden avatar into the water several times.

Liu Lao Cheng reached out toward a certain part of Qingxia Island.

The entire land connected to the Spring Court began to crack open, as if the old cultivator intended to lift it from the ground.

Liu Lao Cheng focused, smirking, “Still trying to hide? I've found you.”

With his other hand, palm facing up, he flicked his fingers, and a youth dressed in a dark green robe was pulled into the air above the mansion, colliding into the mountainside of Qingxia Island with a heavy thud.

Without even glancing at the battle in Shujian Lake behind him, Liu Lao Cheng shifted his gaze, “Liu Zhimo, what do you say? My disciple is about to be beaten to death, yet you’re still so courteous?”

Silence reigned, with no response.

Liu Lao Cheng smirked, “Since Qingxia Island is so polite, I won’t hold back.”

He brought his fingers together and waved lightly.

The seal, which had been thrust into the dragon's head by the golden avatar, shot forth like a wisp of firefly, aimed directly at the Gu Can, who was now embedded deep within the mountainside.

Liu Lao Cheng smiled, “Oh, at least there’s a man among the cultivators of Qingxia Island.”

In his line of sight, a young man clad in golden robes hovered in front of Gu Can, standing on two flying swords. He reached out, and a golden thread rose from the Spring Court.

He grasped the sword, which hovered just out of reach, not yet fully in his grip.

Facing the seal that struck fear into all the elder cultivators of Shujian Lake, the young man tightened his hold on the sword.

Above Qingxia Island, dark clouds swirled.

Liu Lao Cheng frowned, his thoughts stirring. He did not drive his life seal directly toward the young man and the tip of the half-immortal sword but allowed the Fire Spirit Seal to arc gracefully, stopping over a hundred feet away from the young man.

Wild cultivators were decisive and ruthless in their actions but calculated in gains and losses, being meticulous.

Liu Lao Cheng soon relaxed. If that renowned accountant from Qingxia Island had completely refined the half-immortal weapon, it would pose some trouble. However, if it was not yet fully refined, it would not be a concern.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 463: Is the Body Dead Before the Soul?

On the peak of a vassal island in Azure Gorge Island, stood an elegant elder clad in a blue gown, alongside a stocky, fierce-looking old man.

Both were outsiders.

The old master of the Jade Guizong, Xun Yuan, and the former leader of the Invincible Fist Gang, Gao Mian.

Gao Mian noticed a subtle change in Xun Yuan's demeanor and asked, "Xun Yuan, is that someone you know?"

Xun Yuan smiled and nodded, "Quite familiar. Aside from you, he's one of the first people I got to know here in your Baoping Continent. I met him back in Old Dragon City. A remarkable young man. Du Mao suffered greatly at his hands. Speaking of which, Old Liu Cheng should be thanking him for obtaining such a large piece of the Glazed Golden Body fragment."

Gao Mian inquired, "Should I give Old Liu a heads-up? It sounds like he's repaying kindness with malice?"

Xun Yuan shook his head with a smile, "No need for that. What kindness repaid with malice? If that were the case, aside from Old Liu Cheng, everyone in our Jade Guizong, myself included, would need to worship this young man as a living bodhisattva."

Gao Mian grinned, "Really? If Old Liu gets fired up and decides to kill, I won't be able to stop him unless you intervene and are willing to turn a steadfast subordinate into an enemy for no good reason."

Xun Yuan replied slowly, "That young man has a viewpoint similar to yours and mine: in the world of martial arts, life and death are one's own responsibility. Since that's the case, why should I intervene and muddy the waters with all this worldly karma? It's just for fun, isn't it?"

Gao Mian shot a glare at Xun Yuan.

Damn, you've gotten quite bold, haven't you, Xun?

Xun Yuan quickly clasped his fists in apology.

Only then did Gao Mian feel satisfied, watching the standoff in the distance, knowing the outcome was already determined. If Old Liu Cheng acted again, both Gu Can and that young man would not only die, but in this Booklet Lake, no one would be left to collect their bodies.

Gao Mian sighed slightly, "It's a shame. Just based on the fact that he’s the only young one on Azure Gorge Island brave enough to confront Old Liu, I can’t help but think he’s not a bad person."

Xun Yuan replied in a calm tone, "For us old folks who have lived long enough, how many regrettable things have we witnessed with our own eyes? Among the cultivators who have died at our hands, aside from those who deserved it, how many have perished unjustly, yet had no choice but to die? There are some, and it’s destined there will be many more. This is what they call every doctor has their share of wrongful deaths at their door."

Gao Mian crossed his arms, smirking slightly.

Xun Yuan continued, "To say something unpleasant, selecting Booklet Lake as a location for our sect is of paramount importance to our Jade Guizong, a grand endeavor. If that young man were to oppose us, I wouldn’t mind playing the role of the second Du Mao. Du Mao was foolishly arrogant, thinking his cultivation made him invincible and viewing Baoping Continent as a mere speck, acting recklessly without justification. But if I were to act, at least I’d have a point of reason on my side, after all, I would be acting within the rules set by the Sage of Rites. Of course, whether one lives or dies ultimately depends on their own abilities. One must not feign innocence or complain to heaven about being wronged."

Gao Mian nodded, "Hearing you say this makes me view you in a new light."

Xun Yuan smiled faintly, "If Old Liu Cheng wants to kill and establish his authority, he may have to pay a considerable price, much greater than you can imagine."

Gao Mian asked sharply, "Is it tonight that he strikes at the young or later at the old?"

Xun Yuan stated, "It will be tonight."

Gao Mian finally seemed intrigued.

On the other side of Azure Gorge Island, Chen Ping'an pinched a talisman between his fingers and tossed it lightly.

The true form of the Night Wanderer God appeared.

He then handed over the golden binding demon rope, crafted from the whiskers of the old dragon of Jiao Long, to one of the Night Wanderer God puppets.

In that instant, Chen Ping'an firmly grasped the drawn sword of the sword immortal.

Liu Cheng laughed heartily, yet his eyes were extremely dark, "Word has it that you are quite the peculiar sword cultivator in Booklet Lake. Regardless, I’m paying you more attention than Liu Zhimiao. It all depends on whether you have the true skill to make me lose again."

Without Liu Cheng needing to make a move, the golden fire spirit seal hovering in the air spilled down droplets of golden flame. Each droplet of the fire spirit gold liquid suddenly enlarged in mid-air, transforming into a faintly golden armored warrior, armed with various weapons, dozens of them, who landed on Azure Gorge Island and surged toward the two Night Wanderer God true form puppets.

Not only that, but in the waters of Booklet Lake, it was as if an immortal was drawing water, with column after column of water as thick as a wellhead shooting upward, aimed straight at Chen Ping'an.

Holding the sword immortal, Chen Ping'an swung his sword time and again.

The water columns collided with the golden sword qi, swirling together in the air and turning into dust.

Liu Cheng remained relaxed, simply consuming his spiritual energy.

His opponent had to risk their lives repeatedly to shatter those water columns, which were as powerful as the largest siege crossbows of the secular world.

Moreover, they had to be extremely careful to split their focus, guarding against the surprise attack of their own life seal.

Chen Ping'an's hand, gripping the half-immortal weapon, had already worn down to blood and bone, his fingers and palm visible in stark relief.

Liu Cheng was like a cat playing with a mouse.

From time to time, he would give the young man a surprise, such as a rock suddenly falling from the cliff of Azure Gorge Island — it could be as large as a pavilion or as small as a fist, silent and stealthy.

The more Liu Cheng observed, the more interesting he found it.

The young man's expression was incredibly calm.

Clearly, he was in a withered state, his heart parched, all vitality long since drained.

Had the body died before the soul?

Empty and hollow.

Should he just put him out of his misery, or...?

Liu Cheng rarely hesitated like this.

Calculating the gains and losses in his mind, he still showed no signs of slackening in his attack.

He wanted to see how long this young sword cultivator, whose spirit was already overwhelmed and trembling involuntarily, could endure.

Within Booklet Lake, a golden-bodied dharma manifestation wielding a massive axe specifically designed to subdue dragons was battling against a giant mudfish riddled with wounds, the lake's waters turning crimson with blood.

The two Night Wanderer God true form puppets began to dim in golden light.

The golden fire spirit seal continuously dripped fire spirit gold liquid.

The outcome of these two battlefields was beyond doubt.

However, as Chen Ping'an continued to swing his sword, golden threads like fireflies lingered around him, refusing to disperse.

Liu Cheng's killing intent deepened as he watched the silent young man, his desire to spare him waning.

With his bony hand gripping the half-immortal weapon, Chen Ping'an finally revealed a momentary and perilous gap in his energy flow.

Without hesitation, Liu Cheng summoned a deep well of spiritual energy, causing a thunderous roar that shook the surface of the lake, as hundreds of water columns shot up simultaneously.

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath.

He silently recited two words in his heart.

He simply grasped the sword immortal.

Those water columns leaving Booklet Lake continuously converged, surrounding him from all directions.

It was as if he were trapped in a massive, emerald water sphere.

Moments later, the lake water froze and hung in the air.

The young steward’s small figure had long since vanished from sight.

On Azure Gorge Island and among the thousands of cultivators and servants in the nearby vassal islands, everyone believed that the young man was doomed.

Farther away, countless onlookers watched this thrilling battle.

Some sighed in relief, some reveled in misfortune, but a few cultivators and ordinary people who had known the steward for a short time felt a tinge of regret. For instance, Liu Chongrun from Pearl Hairpin Island, along with several maidservants who had dealings with the steward, felt that this Chen Ping'an was not like an ordinary immortal lord. Some felt a mixture of emotions, like the ghost cultivator from Zhu Xian Mansion, while others were genuinely saddened, like the maidservant Hong Su.

In the air.

The surface of the massive emerald water sphere emitted a nearly inaudible crackling sound.

A thread of golden light appeared.

The sounds of cracking grew steadily more intense, more shocking, akin to firecrackers lighting up the New Year in the streets.

Suddenly, on Azure Gorge Island, it was as if a winter rain had begun to fall.

Liu Cheng maintained a calm demeanor, letting the ripples of his heart lake settle, questioning the young man.

After receiving an answer, Liu Cheng nodded.

As for the trembling cultivators on Azure Gorge Island, they saw the steward still hovering in place, performing a strange action: twisting his wrist to hold the sword upside down, remaining silent but facing Liu Cheng, cupping his fists in a gesture of thanks.

Liu Cheng nodded in response.

He retracted the golden-bodied dharma manifestation from Booklet Lake, along with his life seal.

With that, he swiftly departed.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 464: Dawn Breaks

In the night, three elderly men rode the wind together, making their way to Palace Willow Island.

After a great battle, Liu Lao Cheng remained calm and composed.

This was the foundation of a practitioner at the Fifth Realm.

Moreover, Liu Lao Cheng hadn’t even unleashed his true lethal moves yet.

Once his golden body form revealed the half-glass true form he had recently refined, that would be the moment of overwhelming slaughter.

Gao Mian curiously asked, “Why not kill that young man? Leaving roots when cutting grass isn't your usual style, Old Liu.”

Liu Lao Cheng sighed, “You’re shouting so loudly on purpose for me to hear; my ears aren’t deaf.”

Xun Yuan chuckled but said nothing.

Liu Lao Cheng landed at the entrance of Palace Willow Island, and the three men walked slowly forward.

Liu Lao Cheng spoke, “Since that piece of glassy golden body has some connection to my opportunity for advancing to the Twelfth Realm, I must take this relationship into account. Besides, a young man who can survive under Du Mao’s hands—I have no direct conflict with him, so it’s better to leave a line for future encounters. Killing for prestige and injuring for prestige are almost the same. Plus, that kid seems to understand the situation and made a deal with me.”

Gao Mian laughed, “So, which is more—sentiment or apprehension?”

Liu Lao Cheng’s face darkened.

Xun Yuan suddenly said, “If that young man hadn’t made that fist-clenching gesture back then, Old Liu would have surely reconsidered right on the spot and killed him.”

Liu Lao Cheng grunted, “I do have some insight; I wouldn’t raise a tiger to trouble me. Whether that guy is sincere or just pretending, I can see through it.”

Xun Yuan suddenly laughed, “Do you believe that, even in Book Slip Lake, Chen Ping An might outlive that Gu Can?”

Gao Mian shook his head, unconvinced. “Not necessarily. Acknowledging this person’s character is one thing; surviving in the rivers and lakes is another.”

Liu Lao Cheng nodded, “That’s the truth. A barking dog doesn’t bite. The reason I didn’t kill him has a significant reason behind it.”

Liu Lao Cheng looked around, “In a murky place like Book Slip Lake, the so-called clever people are everywhere. If someone is still willing to naively uphold a code of conduct and has enough capability, at least I, Liu Lao Cheng, would trust him enough to do big business with him.”

Gao Mian ignored Liu Lao Cheng’s heartfelt words, only catching one phrase, angrily saying, “You damn it, even flattering Xun Lao Er? Don’t you have any self-respect? Why do you never flatter me?”

Xun Yuan looked helpless.

Liu Lao Cheng shot him a side-eye, “I’ve seen what you’re like when you get out of control; how could I dare to flatter you? I’m afraid that after doing so, I’d end up covered in filth.”

Xun Yuan’s eyes lit up, “Really? There’s such a story? Do tell!”

Liu Lao Cheng felt a bit embarrassed, “A hero doesn’t dwell on past glories; what’s there to chat about?”

Gao Mian laughed heartily, “He ran into the only master of martial arts from our Treasure Bottle Continent in his youth, the head of the Cui family. They got into a brawl over a disagreement. After being thrown down, he finally acknowledged defeat. From then on, he called himself the Martial Arts Tenth Realm. However, that martial artist later went missing; it’s said he went to the Central Divine Continent and probably met a fate similar to that of our Martial Arts Tenth Realm—there, one mountain may have another mountain higher, and his life and death are uncertain.”

Xun Yuan remarked, “A pure martial artist who can reach the Ninth Realm and touch the threshold of the Tenth Realm possesses great resolve. Our Tongye Continent’s martial luck is lacking, even falling short of your small Treasure Bottle Continent—isn’t that strange?”

Gao Mian, straightforward as always, retorted, “What’s strange about it? The martial artists from your Tongye Continent are just useless. How many Tenth Realms do you have now? Maybe two? Do you know how many we have on Treasure Bottle? If you count the one I admire most, plus that Li Er who took down your Tongye Sect’s ancestral hall, and the Dali feudal king Song Changjing—three!”

Liu Lao Cheng appeared to have grasped something.

Xun Yuan smiled.

That’s why he could become friends with this invincible martial arts leader, while with the more cunning Liu Lao Cheng, he would only be allies.

---

As the battle concluded, Chen Ping An carried Gu Can down the mountain slowly.

The Divine Manifestation Talisman had already been tucked away, its divine light nearly exhausted. Next time he wanted to “call the deity down,” it would likely dissipate without needing a full incense stick, let alone a fight.

Gu Can’s face was smeared with blood, looking severely battered and heavily injured.

But at least he had survived.

The near-death river dragon flicked its tail gently and swam to a more distant place, eventually sinking into the depths of Book Slip Lake.

There, it had secretly excavated a crude form of a “Dragon Palace” over the years.

Liu Lao Cheng had showcased his might on Qingxia Island, striking Gu Can and that river dragon's kin into a near-death state, all with his invincible posture as a Fifth Realm practitioner.

As the new ruler of the rivers and lakes, Liu Zhi Zhao, the master of Qingxia Island, had never shown himself.

Instead, it was the accountant who had stepped in to stop Liu Lao Cheng.

In the end, the once-famous Liu Lao Cheng, who had proclaimed, “Even if you feel soft-hearted when killing, you mustn’t hold back,” had actually shown mercy?

For a moment, the tens of thousands of wild practitioners around Book Slip Lake felt as if they were seeing through a fog, becoming increasingly bewildered.

On the mountain path, as the little loach entered its burrow and began to enter a state of hibernation, Gu Can’s wounds began to improve slightly.

He wrapped his arms around Chen Ping An's neck and whispered, “Chen Ping An, are you planning to take the little loach back? Tan Xue is actually quite afraid of you after all; you are the true owner of the little loach. With you, I’m not worried about her being wronged. If it were someone else, once I can’t protect her, I’d wish for Tan Xue to die, but if you take her, I can accept it, and I definitely won’t regret it later. You know my character; I mean what I say.”

“Keep her. With Tan Xue by your side, I can focus on my own matters.” 

“Why is that? Aren’t you afraid Tan Xue is just a pawn to me?”

“I once obtained a celestial treasure in Tongye Continent—a sword called Obsessed Heart, or it can be called Eating Heart, which literally eats people’s hearts. Just stabbing it at someone’s heart can elevate its rank. At first, I hated it; I couldn’t bear to use it, let alone even look at it. But later, I realized that objects are lifeless, while people are alive. A gentleman doesn’t rely on tools to manage everything. Never mind; you don’t like to hear these principles, so I won’t say more.”

“Go ahead. I don’t know why, but I used to feel troubled; now, listening to your ramblings isn’t bad. Even if I don’t remember much, it’s still pleasant to hear. Chen Ping An, isn’t it strange?”

Chen Ping An changed the subject, “This is the second time.”

Gu Can reacted, “I’m aware. The first time was when I didn’t leave Qingxia Island; this time, you saved me. If there’s a third time, you won’t care about me anymore and will treat me as a stranger.”

Chen Ping An replied blandly, “At least you know your place and have some conscience.”

Gu Can laughed, “Ha. It’s not much, just towards my mother and you—only you two. As for my deadbeat father, I have no impression of him and can’t get close to him. As for meeting him when the family is reunited, I’m not eager to think about it.”

Chen Ping An’s voice grew hoarse, “Take your time.”

“Chen Ping An, I still want to know why you saved me this time. I know you’ve always been disappointed in me. I know that’s why I often take the little loach to sit by the door, even if nothing’s happening, just to wait there for a bit.”

“Stop talking.”

“I won’t die anytime soon. The little loach is already resting at its old nest at the bottom of the water, and I’m feeling better. Chen Ping An, tell me, I want to hear… your reasoning.”

Chen Ping An’s throat moved slightly; he forced down the fresh blood. As long as Gu Can was willing to listen, he was willing to share. His face was already paler than Gu Can’s, and his chest was heaving heavily. After a few gentle breaths, he steadied himself and rasped, “I’ve drawn a line and defined our relationship. This is a term derived from chess but can also be applied to swordsmanship. Simply put, the former is like me moving out of Spring Court and living at the mountain gate. The latter means I’ve been watching you. As long as you don’t step out of the circle I consider safe, I’ll help you. I’ll still be the neighbor you first knew from Mud Bottle Lane.”

“But what if after you arrived at Qingxia Island, I continued to kill innocents? Would you leave? Or would you kill me?”

“I would try my best to stop you from making mistakes, just like today when I prevented Liu Lao Cheng from killing you. Moreover, I won’t leave Book Slip Lake; there are many things waiting for me to do, both for you and for myself.”

“Isn’t it tiring to live like this?”

“Back in Mud Bottle Lane, living every day as if I’d never escape from a lifetime of suffering, wasn’t that tiring? It was tiring, but you just forgot.”

“But living is about being happy and carefree, isn’t it?”

“On this question that brings us back to the starting point, I can certainly give you an answer, but you might not be able to absorb it, so I won’t say it. Therefore, I hope that in the future you can leave Book Slip Lake and see the broader rivers and lakes for yourself. By the way, I’ve taken on a core disciple, a young girl named Pei Qian. If you leave Book Slip Lake and roam the rivers and lakes, or if you return to Longquan County and I’m not around, you can find her. I think you two might get along well—although there’s also a chance you won’t see eye to eye.”

Gu Can felt a bit happy.

Because this was the first time Chen Ping An spoke of a future that intertwined with him.

Gu Can murmured, “Chen Ping An, I’m a bit sleepy.”

Chen Ping An spoke softly, “Then sleep for a while. You don’t need to worry about what comes next; I’ll be here.”

Gu Can struggled to stay awake and softly whimpered, “Chen Ping An, I’m really afraid that when I open my eyes, you’d have secretly left Qingxia Island.”

Chen Ping An assured, “I won’t.”

Gu Can’s voice gradually faded, “You’re really not lying to me?”

Chen Ping An countered, “When have I ever lied to you?”

Gu Can gently nodded and fell asleep.

Gu Can was already asleep.

So, he didn’t notice that the blood that Chen Ping An couldn’t wipe from his face kept dripping onto Gu Can’s arm.

---

Inside Spring Court.

Gu Can lay on the bed.

A woman sat beside the bed, heartbroken.

Tian Hu Jun had brought precious elixirs from Qingxia Island.

But when she saw the accountant standing by the bed, she was inexplicably shaken, her hands trembling.

Chen Ping An glanced at the medicine bottle in her hand, his voice hoarse, “No problems?”

Tian Hu Jun nodded vigorously, “I guarantee it with my life!”

Chen Ping An said, “After returning, tell Liu Zhi Zhao that I’ll be looking for him soon.”

Tian Hu Jun had no choice but to comply.

After administering the elixir to the unconscious Gu Can, Tian Hu Jun hurriedly fled.

The woman was flustered, repeatedly muttering, “How could this happen? How could this happen…”

Chen Ping An trembled slightly as he moved a chair next to her, asking, “Why wouldn’t this happen?”

The woman looked up, her tearful eyes fixed on the now considerably thinner young man, feeling suddenly so unfamiliar.

Chen Ping An continued, “Do you want to ask me if I watched Gu Can get severely injured on purpose?”

The woman’s gaze wavered.

Chen Ping An answered himself, “It wasn’t like that. The most I could do at that moment was just this much.”

The woman sighed, lowering her eyes, her face marked with tears, nodding, “I trust you, Chen Ping An.”

At this moment, Chen Ping An felt a pang of sadness.

It was related to Gu Can and his aunt, but it wasn’t entirely connected.

That night at the ferry, he had already figured out one of the core issues in their deadlock.

For Chen Ping An, proving this point wasn’t difficult.

He only needed to subtly exhibit one or two details in front of Gu Can, such as placing more importance on some external item than Gu Can did.

Gu Can’s true feelings, concerning that piece of his heart that was related to Chen Ping An, would also go to waste, quickly becoming overgrown with weeds, and potentially leading to a fallout between them, given Gu Can’s tendency to extremes.

Chen Ping An didn’t want to validate it, nor did he want to test human hearts.

Knowing the answer, what good would it do?

Setting aside all else, if we only talk about grievances and gains, it wasn’t just a fear that Gu Can’s views of him would shift from familial to hostile.

In his own peace of mind, Chen Ping An wasn’t afraid of any enemy’s strength in their fists; from the alley’s Cai Jin Jian and Fu Nan Hua, to the mountain-moving ape, and all the enemies on the road thereafter, it was the same.

Chen Ping An didn’t want to lose that little snot-nosed brat from back then, nor did he want to lose the Gu Can who had reached this point for his mother.

Even more, he didn’t want Gu Can to share his sorrow.

In the affairs of the world and human relationships, does it mean that the deeper one thinks, the more one finds it hard to communicate with others?

Chen Ping An sat on the chair, closed his eyes for a moment to rest, then stood up.

The woman nervously asked, “Chen Ping An, where are you going?”

Chen Ping An replied, “As long as I’m on Qingxia Island, it’s all the same wherever I am; don’t worry, Aunt.”

The woman hesitated to speak but ultimately didn’t dare to insist on keeping him.

As soon as Chen Ping An stepped out of Spring Court, he immediately pressed his hand to his chest, covering his mouth.

Taking a deep breath, he slowly walked toward the house at the mountain gate.

When he reached that room, he opened the door, closed it, and lit the lamp on the table.

Chen Ping An sat on the bench with his back to the window, trembling slightly as he took out the ointment he bought from Yang’s Pharmacy and forced it down.

Alone, he sat.

On the table rested the sword-raising gourd, with the flying swords placed by the door and window, one on the first and the fifteenth.

Not human feelings, not possible, hard to approach, hard to befriend.

Thus, disappointment arose.

Thinking of home at night, one should still speak of the travelers.

It seemed to bring hope.

But in the end, one would still be disappointed.

After swallowing that ointment concocted by Old Yang, Chen Ping An, now devoid of sensation from his body to spirit, blankly stared at the lamp light, its flame thinning as daybreak approached.

His eyes, as lifeless as the depths of an ancient well, turned to the window.

Dawn had arrived.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 465: People Change

In the bitter cold of winter, the lake lay vast and desolate, its chill seeping into the bones.

Gu Can had been in a coma for three days and nights. Chen Ping'an would sit by the sickbed each day, enveloped in the pungent scent of medicine.

It reminded him of the times when Gu Can and the little loach would sit outside the mountain gate, basking in the sun.

Inside the room, Chen Ping'an would occasionally rise to check Gu Can's pulse at the bedside. After so long in this situation, he had become something of an expert. He could discern whether her injuries were worsening or healing. The miraculous elixir that Liu Zhimo had sent via Tian Hujun had shown significant results, likely similar to the precious pills crafted for earth immortals by the Qinghu Palace’s Lu Yong.

On this day, Gu Can finally stirred awake and saw Chen Ping'an sitting in a chair. She smiled broadly, but quickly fell back asleep, her breathing much steadier than before.

After Chen Ping'an left the Spring Courtyard (Chunting Fu), the woman hesitated for a moment before instructing an old housekeeper, a cultivator of the Longmen realm, to summon Liu Zhimo for a discussion.

She sat by the bed, gently holding Gu Can's still warm hand, her eyes filled with unshed tears.

Drifting in her thoughts, she finally let out a soft sigh.

Fortunately, Gu Can's life was no longer in jeopardy. It was a pity, though, that she had missed out on the carefully prepared “immortal meal” from the Spring Courtyard.

For cultivators, food was of paramount importance. Among the many schools of thought, the medical practitioners placed significant emphasis on this. The saying goes, "Food is heaven for the people," and it applied just as much to the cultivators living on the mountain.

Based on the twenty-four solar terms throughout the year, there existed a comprehensive system of seasonal medicinal supplements. These could enhance a cultivator’s physique and spirit, much like the dietary supplements of the wealthy.

Of course, for everything to be interconnected and beneficial to cultivation, it required daily and yearly commitment, which meant one had to be quite wealthy.

The woman soon steeled her resolve.

The resilience of a woman facing life’s hardships, a mother’s concern for her son’s future, and the meticulousness of a widow counting every copper coin were akin to the bricks and tiles that had pieced together the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, providing shelter for the two of them.

She stepped lightly over the threshold. Outside, a young maid with her blouse half-open reached to help close the door, but the woman shot her a glare, causing her to retract her hand quickly. The woman then gently shut the door herself.

In the opulent living room of the Spring Courtyard, she met the newly seated Master of the Book Scroll Lake, the True Monarch of the River Segments, Liu Zhimo.

He was the same otherworldly figure who had once led her and her daughter out of Mud Bottle Alley.

Looking at the woman before him, Liu Zhimo noted how she had transformed from a rustic beauty into the elegant resident of the Spring Courtyard on Qingxia Island. Three years had passed, and her beauty had not diminished; instead, she had gained an air of nobility, her skin as smooth as a young girl’s. Liu Zhimo also knew that she was now considered more elegant than the consorts of the Shihao Kingdom. Taking the cup of hot tea that the housekeeper had cautiously offered, he gently swirled the lid, regretting that he hadn't acted sooner to win her over back then. If he had, he might not be in such a position today, where he found himself wary of his disciple.

Once the woman was subdued, she would have countless reasons and excuses to completely convince herself.

Perhaps she could use that to better control Gu Can.

As long as he continued to provide her with wealth and status, she would cling fiercely to it, determined to preserve this legacy for her son.

That would make her the best ally for Qingxia Island.

Instead, she had begun to develop a greater appetite, living in a Spring Courtyard that rivaled the residences of lords and looking longingly at Liu Zhimo’s mansion, the Hengbo House. From the beginning, she had fawned over Tian Hujun, trying to gauge his intentions, but now, while she maintained an outward cordiality, there was an underlying arrogance that could not be concealed. Not only that, but this well-off village woman had begun to read, even dabbling in the arts and music, seeking instruction from several young ladies of noble birth on etiquette and refined practices.

This made Liu Zhimo chuckle to himself; she truly was a remarkable person.

However, any lingering regret Liu Zhimo felt dissipated quickly.

He smiled and asked, "Madam, are you looking to discuss something?"

The woman nodded, saying, "I wish to confirm something with you, True Monarch. What exactly is Chen Ping'an after by coming to our Qingxia Island? Is it really just to take back the little loach from Gu Can? Also, what is the origin of the jade token he entrusted to you?"

Liu Zhimo set down his tea without drinking, gently placing the lid aside. The fragrant steam rose, and he laughed, "Ah, so that’s what’s on your mind. I thought you were going to hold me accountable for Gu Can's lack of protection from her master."

The woman replied, "Let’s not dwell on that. I trust you have your reasons for what happened, so I won't hold any grudges. I can also assure you that I will speak positively on your behalf with Gu Can. Otherwise, wouldn’t that just give the lurking wolves and tigers an advantage?"

Liu Zhimo smiled knowingly. Who said women were less perceptive?

He nodded, "As for that jade token, it has quite a history, but I can't reveal its secrets. As for Chen Ping'an's intentions for coming to Book Scroll Lake, it’s truly hard to speculate. To be honest, I’ve been puzzled by it since we established our account here. After taking on the role of the steward for Qingxia Island, I’m even more baffled. However, I believe that Chen Ping'an means no harm to Gu Can."

The woman furrowed her brow, sensing something odd. She thought Liu Zhimo was being unusually evasive today. In previous discussions, he had never been so roundabout. Had the recent upheaval involving Liu Laocheng rattled him so much? After such highs and lows, had he lost his composure? Could it be that such a cunning figure as Liu Zhimo was actually more timid than a mere woman?

Liu Zhimo squinted slightly and said with a smile, "You know better than I do how Chen Ping'an’s character is. He’s sentimental and cares deeply for Gu Can, wishing to give her all the good things. However, things have changed since those days in Mud Bottle Alley, when life was rough and chaotic. People change, and Chen Ping'an seems to have adopted Confucian ideals, so he prefers to reason things out. But that may not suit Book Scroll Lake, which is why he struck Gu Can twice in the city. To my eyes, it’s precisely because he cares for her that he acted this way. Most people, when they see their loved ones thriving, would only celebrate without concern for anything else. For instance, if it were Lü Caisang, seeing Gu Can become wealthy would only make her think, 'This is talent, and having power is a good thing.'"

The woman tugged at the corner of her mouth.

Liu Zhimo sighed, "Returning to the matter at hand, Chen Ping'an's thoughts are not misguided; he simply doesn’t understand the harsh realities of Book Scroll Lake. Fortunately, after spending some time here, he should have learned a bit about our rules and will likely stop meddling in Gu Can's affairs. Madam, if we flip the perspective, it’s clear that for someone like Chen Ping'an, emotions matter more than anything else. It varies from person to person and place to place."

The woman pondered this, realizing that Liu Zhimo’s words were quite reasonable. Previously, he had only offered polite chit-chat.

She was indeed the same woman who never lost an argument in her small town; she understood immediately.

Feeling a bit regretful, she thought that if she had taken Liu Zhimo’s words into account, from the moment she saw Chen Ping'an carrying Gu Can back to the Spring Courtyard to when he finally left, she had indeed acted poorly.

Had she heard Liu Zhimo’s insights earlier, she wouldn’t have made so many mistakes that night.

These past two years, whenever she had free time, she had taken pleasure in having the maids nearby to massage her shoulders, fan her when it was hot, and keep her warm by the stove. Inevitably, she would have one of the maids, rumored to be the daughter of a minister, read various books to her. She had heard many exalted principles that scholars and literati admired, though she didn’t particularly enjoy them. However, some anecdotes often inspired her. For example, she recalled learning of someone who, upon hearing of a fire at a neighbor’s house, first inquired about injuries before asking about the damage. That person’s reputation soared, becoming renowned for their benevolence. The woman realized that she could also take such an approach, which would be the best way to win people over. She also recalled legendary generals who, despite holding high positions, were willing to suckle the wounds of their soldiers, earning their loyalty. She had taken note of all this.

She could hardly believe how foolish she had been. Liu Zhimo’s words were, in fact, the very principles she had recognized and committed to memory. So why had she failed to act on them in the moment?

Liu Zhimo, noticing her unusual demeanor, asked, "What’s wrong, Madam?"

With a forced smile, she replied, "Nothing. May I ask, True Monarch, how should we proceed from here? Will Liu Laocheng continue to bully us on Qingxia Island?"

Liu Zhimo reassured her, "Liu Laocheng is one of the greatest heroes in the history of Book Scroll Lake. Even his enemies admire him. He is decisive in his actions; when he came to Qingxia Island, he aimed to kill Gu Can, and no one could stop him. But now that he has spared Gu Can, no one can change his mind. He won’t be making another trip to Qingxia Island, so Gu Can and the Spring Courtyard are no longer in danger. I can assure you, after that night’s confrontation, Gu Can is truly safe. In the current Book Scroll Lake, no one would dare kill someone Liu Laocheng has decided to spare!"

The woman was skeptical.

Liu Zhimo said no more, allowing her to ponder his words. Whether true or false, if he spoke too definitively, she might become suspicious and choose to disbelieve him.

The woman turned, picked up her teacup, and took a sip, her demeanor graceful and elegant, shedding any trace of her former rusticity.

Suddenly lowering his voice, Liu Zhimo asked, "Madam, why are you so... uneasy about Chen Ping'an?"

Her eyes became clouded, "You just said, people change."

Liu Zhimo stroked his beard and chuckled.

The woman asked, "True Monarch, do you think I can be considered a bad person here in Book Scroll Lake?"

Liu Zhimo shook his head, "Of course not. You can be considered a good person, fair in rewards and punishments, and not harsh on your servants."

She replied, "Even bad people occasionally have a good heart. What I did to Chen Ping'an back then was merely offering a bowl of rice; is that so strange? My current wariness of Chen Ping'an is for Gu Can's lifelong happiness and her cultivation path. I'm not looking to harm him; what’s so strange about that?"

Liu Zhimo nodded in understanding, "Now that you mention it, I see your point."

The woman covered her mouth and laughed, her eyes twinkling with charm. She then asked, "True Monarch, do you not like the tea from the Spring Courtyard? Is that why you haven't had a sip? If I recall correctly, this was personally sent by Tian Hujun from the Rainbow Drink Island. Do you perhaps have even better tea hidden in your residence?"

"Your words wound me, Madam. Very well, I will spend money to have someone scour for better tea than that from Rainbow Drink Island for the Spring Courtyard."

Liu Zhimo pointed at her, laughing heartily. He gently placed the lid back on his teacup and took his leave, telling her not to see him off.

The woman stood and then sat again, contemplating for a moment before leaving.

The old housekeeper, who had been standing at the courtyard door rather than the hall door, hurried into the living room. Normally, he would allow the maids to tidy up, but today was different with the island lord present; he felt it necessary to handle it himself.

As the old cultivator collected Liu Zhimo's teacup, not a drop of tea remained, just a few emerald-green leaves resting at the bottom.

He couldn’t help but reflect on how Liu Zhimo continued to trust the Spring Courtyard and its mistress.

*(End of Chapter)*

 # Chapter 466: A True Confidant

After leaving the Spring Courtyard Manor, Liu Zhimiao headed straight back to his residence, instructing someone to go purchase several pounds of the finest tea leaves from the capital of the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

This hopeful candidate for the Upper Five Realms, the True Monarch of the River Crossing (Jiejiang Zhenjun), sat on a priceless meditation cushion in a secret chamber, opening his palm to reveal a small, translucent water orb. He took a white bowl from his sleeve and placed the water orb inside.

Liu Zhimiao remained in deep meditation until late into the night before using his divine powers to appear in front of the house at the mountain gate, gently knocking on the door.

Upon entering, he found Chen Pingan already seated at the table, having circled around his desk, and gestured for Liu Zhimiao to take a seat.

The young man from Mud Bottle Alley, instead of pointing a finger at Liu Zhimiao and lashing out, remained calm. This was both a good and a bad thing.

Liu Zhimiao sat across from Chen Pingan, smiling as he explained, "Earlier, Mr. Chen did not allow me to disturb you at will, so I had no choice but to forgo the customary hospitality. Now that you wish to see me, I naturally did not want you to make the effort to come here, so I took the liberty of visiting without prior notice. I hope you can forgive me."

A venerable old cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage, on his own territory in Qingxia Island, spoke with such humility, demonstrating both flexibility and resolve.

Chen Pingan maintained a blank expression and extended his hand.

Liu Zhimiao quickly flipped his wrist, allowing a crystal-clear jade token to hover above his palm, careful not to touch it. He gently pushed it towards Chen Pingan, who accepted it.

Then, Liu Zhimiao produced a water bowl and pushed it towards Chen Pingan, stopping it in the center of the table. He smiled and said, "Gu Can's mother has sought me out, and I have some words I hope Mr. Chen will listen to. I know my actions are somewhat despicable, but they do reflect a measure of sincerity."

The surface of the water in the white bowl rippled gently.

Soon, voices from Liu Zhimiao and the woman could be heard echoing from the Spring Courtyard Manor.

Unexpectedly, Chen Pingan extended his arm and covered the mouth of the bowl with his palm, shattering the ripples. The bowl, which had contained the echoing water, fell silent.

With his other hand—the one that had held the Half-Immortal Sword that night—Chen Pingan's palm remained strikingly disfigured, a sight that would chill anyone's heart.

Liu Zhimiao looked at him with genuine admiration and said, "Mr. Chen is truly a man of integrity. I, Liu Zhimiao, have underestimated your resolve."

Chen Pingan withdrew his hand, his sleeves covering his arms, and said, "I know what kind of person she is and what she thinks. Her words might be worse than I could imagine. However, the moment I left the Spring Courtyard, her actions and words became irrelevant to me."

Liu Zhimiao nodded, understanding.

Chen Pingan continued slowly, "Back in Mud Bottle Alley, you, in your efforts to help the Gu Can you fancied, used secret techniques to manipulate Cai Jinjian of Yunxia Mountain. You even employed sinister methods, secretly inscribing the words 'yearning for death' in my heart, baiting me into attempting to assassinate Cai Jinjian and Fu Nanhua, an act of utter folly, all to ensure I vanished completely."

Liu Zhimiao replied, "I admit to that; I won't deny it. Mr. Chen, don't you have a Half-Immortal Sword? You could stab me in the heart or the head, and I wouldn't fight back. After that, we would be even! If you still insist on pursuing this matter, well, let's see what happens."

Chen Pingan chuckled lightly, "I've now witnessed the style of your Shujian Lake; it never fails to entertain, with fresh happenings every day."

Liu Zhimiao maintained a serious demeanor, silent as ever.

In fact, among the people in Shujian Lake, excluding Gu Can and the woman, Liu Zhimiao was known for his few words and reluctance to speak, always wearing a smile. Especially in the eyes of disciples like Tian Hujun and the vassal 'ministers' like Yu Huai, Liu Zhimiao's facade of righteousness belied his ruthless nature, proving to be quite intimidating.

A person who rarely speaks is either simply honest and not good with words or has schemes and plots as numerous as hairs on a beast.

Thus, the old island master of Tianmiao Island, who had the least regard for Liu Zhimiao, once labeled him a "pseudo-true monarch, smiling Buddha, hiding a Shura blade in his sleeve" with a sharp tongue.

Chen Pingan then made a move that caused Liu Zhimiao's eyelids to twitch slightly. He raised a hand wrapped in cloth from his sleeve, removed the sword-feeding gourd from his waist, and poured half a bowl of dark wine into the white bowl in front of Liu Zhimiao, sliding it back to him. Chen Pingan placed the gourd on the edge of the table and smiled, "Stabbing you with a sword—what good would it do? Not to mention whether it could injure a True Monarch; even if it could, I know the methods of those immortal beings on the mountain to evade death; there’s more than one way."

Liu Zhimiao took the white bowl and drank the wine in one gulp, "Mr. Chen, you are wise and fortunate. Back then, I, Liu Zhimiao, was indeed shortsighted; I accept my punishment. Feel free to state your conditions."

Chen Pingan replied, "If I said to let bygones be bygones, you wouldn't believe me, and quite frankly, I wouldn't believe it either."

Liu Zhimiao laughed heartily and pushed the white bowl away, "Given Mr. Chen's straightforwardness, I must ask for another bowl of wine."

Chen Pingan indeed filled Liu Zhimiao's bowl again, just about half full.

Liu Zhimiao downed it without hesitation.

If any cultivator from Qingxia Island had seen this scene, they likely would have thought it a convivial gathering, a reunion filled with smiles, where past grievances were drowned in wine.

Chen Pingan said, "Before I state my conditions, I have a question for the True Monarch."

Liu Zhimiao nodded, "I will speak candidly."

Chen Pingan asked, "True Monarch, what is the root of your cultivation?"

Liu Zhimiao answered without hesitation, "A cultivator seeks truth in their path."

Chen Pingan pressed on, "Could you elaborate? Speak of your own techniques?"

Liu Zhimiao hesitated slightly but still began to explain, "Emotions and desires are a tangled mess. One must untangle them, categorize them..."

At this point, Liu Zhimiao pointed to the row of cabinets behind the desk. "Just like how Mr. Chen organizes different secret records."

Liu Zhimiao continued, "From then on, practitioners who choose to walk this unorthodox path each have their own selections and unique paths to tread. They can condense their practice to the size of a mustard seed and set it aside, or expand it into mountains, continuously solidifying—these are all methods of cultivation. As for how many grains one can condense or how many mountains one can build, that depends on each person's innate talents and gifts. There are many obstacles along the way; dealing with those mustard seeds, for example, one could derive ancient techniques like the Three Corpse Severing Method or internal alchemy methods. As for how to build mountains, there are paths like consuming the essence of the clouds or taking external elixirs. The speed of cultivation and the height of bottlenecks depend on the quality of one's inherited cultivation techniques."

Liu Zhimiao paused, "I can only explain up to this point. When it comes to fundamental truths, continuing further would lead to true yearning for death. It would be better to let Mr. Chen stab me once more."

Liu Zhimiao asked, "I know you have plans in mind; how about a straightforward answer?"

Chen Pingan smiled, "No rush. I have another question: Liu Lao Cheng, like a waiting bird, has plunged the reputation of Qingxia Island into the depths of the lake overnight along with that little mudfish. Can the True Monarch still be the ruler of this Jianghu? Will you spit out the fat morsel in your mouth and hand it over to Liu Lao Cheng, resigning yourself to being an alien king in Shujian Lake, or are you planning to fight back? With Liu Lao Cheng lurking in the shadows, do you still have the Great Li Slingshot behind you?"

Liu Zhimiao didn't answer directly but sighed in both frustration and resignation, "What I fear is that Great Li has quietly turned to support Liu Lao Cheng. Without a backing, Qingxia Island, with its slight frame, cannot stir up any storms. In Liu Lao Cheng's eyes, I, Liu Zhimiao, am no better than those minor ladies on the island. Let alone stripping a few garments; even skinning me alive would be a trivial matter."

Chen Pingan chuckled, "I've heard that the True Monarch brews excellent tea and enjoys cheap wine. I, however, cannot seem to adapt to tea; I only know what I've read on paper."

Liu Zhimiao replied begrudgingly, "Mr. Chen's teachings, I will remember."

Chen Pingan's smile faded, "If you wish to wipe the slate clean between us, it can be done, but you must hand over one person to me."

Liu Zhimiao shook his head immediately, "That cannot be done. Don't even consider it, Mr. Chen."

Liu Zhimiao laughed, "To speak frankly, she's just a half-human, half-ghost woman from the Zhu Xian Manor. Liu Lao Cheng forcibly took her away that night, or like you, he could have come to ask me for her. Would I have dared to refuse? But why didn't Liu Lao Cheng do that? Have you considered it?"

Chen Pingan remained seated quietly across from Liu Zhimiao, like a faded, painted deity in a desolate land.

Liu Zhimiao curiously asked, "This secret matter, not only is she unaware, but even the ghost cultivator Ma Yuanzhi from Zhu Xian Manor is clueless. How did you deduce it?"

Chen Pingan didn't hide anything, "First, it was the origin of the name Zhu Xian Manor, then the name of a jar of wine."

Liu Zhimiao looked increasingly puzzled, addressing Chen Pingan with respect, "Please enlighten me, Mr. Chen."

Chen Pingan spoke slowly, "The ghost cultivator Ma Yuanzhi, born of a humble background, has a deep fondness for Liu Chongrun of Zhu Chai Island. I heard him recount old stories about his past, and when he mentioned Zhu Xian Manor, he seemed quite smug but wouldn't provide an answer. So, I went to Zhu Chai Island and tested Liu Chongrun with the three characters of Zhu Xian Manor. This female cultivator immediately became furious, though she didn’t reveal the truth, she did insult Ma Yuanzhi as a shameless person. I then made a special trip to Pool Water City, and under the pretense of buying ancient texts, I inquired with several old shopkeepers at the bookstores. That’s when I learned there’s a relatively obscure poem from the homeland of Liu Chongrun and Ma Yuanzhi that goes, 'Chongrun echoes Zhu Xian,' which unraveled the mystery. Ma Yuanzhi's smugness in naming his residence as Zhu Xian cleverly plays on the homophone with 'thinking.'"

Liu Zhimiao clapped his hands in laughter, "Wonderful! If not for Mr. Chen unveiling the truth, I would have never known that Ma Yuanzhi, with a lowly status, had such refined tastes."

Chen Pingan continued, "Huang Teng wine, palace wall willows. The red crisp hometown's official wine, Shujian Lake's Gong Liu Island, and the heavy malice lingering on Hong Su, all laden with unwavering grievances and resentment. There’s no need for me to look through the secret histories of Shujian Lake; it’s well-known that Liu Lao Cheng’s love affair with his disciple ended without a conclusion, with the latter's sudden death and Liu Lao Cheng's departure from Shujian Lake. Coupled with how cautious you, Liu Zhimiao, are, you of all people know that the greatest rival to becoming the ruler of Shujian Lake is not the two islands of Yili Island and Qingzhuang Tianmiao, which serve as your internal support, but rather the ever-elusive Liu Lao Cheng. If you dare to compete for this Jianghu ruler, apart from relying on the support of Great Li to gather strength, you certainly have your own hidden methods to ensure your safety, leaving yourself a route of retreat, so that when Liu Lao Cheng, a cultivator of the Upper Five Realms, returns to Shujian Lake, he will at least not kill you."

Liu Zhimiao laughed heartily.

Truly, a confidant!

It was utterly unexpected: in this vast Shujian Lake, the one who understood him best turned out to be this young outsider!

Chen Pingan looked slightly weary, "I'll first lay down half a condition: you must have manipulated Gu Can's mother, so withdraw that influence. Gu Can poses no threat to you now, and your pressing concern is how to retain your position as the Jianghu ruler against Liu Lao Cheng of Gong Liu Island. As for the Great Li side, I will see what I can do to assist you discreetly. At the very least, I won't let you become a pawn in Liu Lao Cheng's ascent."

Liu Zhimiao frowned, "The life and death of Hong Su are still under my control."

The young accountant, with slightly sunken cheeks, took a sip from the gourd, coughed a few times, and said, "But what if? What if Liu Lao Cheng is no longer the same Gong Liu Island lord as before? If his path forward involves significant matters, is Hong Su really that important? Back then, you couldn't let go, but are you certain you still can't now? Who's to say that when 'what if' becomes reality, he won't directly end Hong Su's life and then take you out for daring to touch Liu Lao Cheng's reverse scale? So, Liu Zhimiao, the choice is yours; I'm just offering a way to prevent the worst outcome."

Liu Zhimiao asked a crucial question, "Mr. Chen, can you truly influence the decisions of the Great Li's upper echelons?"

Chen Pingan nodded, "I can, but it’s limited. However, I can clearly tell you that the Song family of Great Li still owes me some favors."

Liu Zhimiao observed this young man.

His heart was filled with mixed emotions.

Liu Zhimiao put away the white bowl and stood up, "Within three days, I will give you a clear answer, Mr. Chen."

Chen Pingan remained seated, "I hope True Monarch can seek the truth when it comes to the path of the Dao and matters of life and death."

Liu Zhimiao's lips twitched, "I will."

After Liu Zhimiao left, Chen Pingan found himself coughing incessantly.

That night, he had forcibly wielded that sword.

The hidden dangers were endless.

Having already damaged a crucial life point, this was undoubtedly adding insult to injury.

But none of that mattered.

Chen Pingan was never afraid of being broke again, of having nothing.

However.

There were some subtle losses that others might not care about.

Even the smallest losses could deter Chen Pingan from wanting to drink.

Stepping out of the house, he passed through the mountain gate, picked up some pebbles, and squatted by the lakeshore, tossing them into the water one by one.

Gu Can, what I want isn’t that little mudfish. It never was, or else after you said those words in Mud Bottle Alley, I could have disregarded Auntie's kindness.

But I know that you know all of this. That’s why you said those things; you must receive a definitive answer from me to feel completely reassured in your most vulnerable moments.

This is where Gu Can is clever, yet not clever enough.

This isn’t to say that Gu Can has a particular stance towards Chen Pingan. In truth, Chen Pingan remains a significant presence for Gu Can—someone who could strike her multiple times or even twenty times without her daring to retaliate, as long as it doesn’t involve fundamental interests.

The truth is simple: Chen Pingan has always been the grass shoe boy from Mud Bottle Alley, while Gu Can is still that little child with a runny nose. Back then, the grass shoe boy and the little snotty child could only rely on each other, unaware of their true intentions or the other’s heart. As time flows on, life brings people together and apart, hearts entwining and separating.

What Chen Pingan desires is merely for Gu Can or Auntie to ask casually, "Chen Pingan, are you badly injured? Are you okay?"

After tossing the last pebble, Chen Pingan squatted there, lifted his head, and gently exhaled a breath, the winter mist enveloping him.

He shrugged his shoulders, lowered his head, and warmed his hands with his breath.

 # Chapter 467: The Cultivator's Heart, Is It Worthless?

On the much-anticipated Gongliu Island.

Liu Laocheng had already announced to the entire Shujian Lake that no one was allowed to approach within a thousand feet of the island.

Not a single soul dared to cross that line.

After another day of heavy drinking, the perpetually intoxicated Gao Mian fell into a deep slumber, leaving only Xun Yuan and Liu Laocheng to share drinks in a dilapidated pavilion.

To the common folk, the land immortals were concerned with achieving longevity that spanned the ages, remaining indifferent to the sweltering heat and biting cold of the seasons.

The two did not engage in much conversation.

Suddenly, Xun Yuan chuckled, “It’s about time we head back.”

Liu Laocheng nodded. “Tongyezhou cannot do without Elder Xun’s guidance.”

Xun Yuan shook his head. “Gao Mian won’t think too deeply about these matters. He believes my journey to Baopingzhou is solely to see him, but that’s only half true. You’re different; now you’re considered one of our Yuguizong family. So, some confidential matters should be shared openly with you.”

Liu Laocheng, who was like a deity in Shujian Lake, spoke in a grave tone, “Elder Xun, please go on.”

Xun Yuan recalled how he had sent a “talented scholar and beautiful woman fighting” book to Zhu Lian at the dusty apothecary in Old Dragon City. In Gao Mian’s presence, he had been humble and subservient, practically a sidekick carrying the money bag for the leader of the Invincible Fist Gang. Xun Yuan had genuinely enjoyed the experience, never pretending or scheming for anything.

But when it came to Liu Laocheng, he felt a sense of awe.

Xun Yuan spoke softly, “As for me, there’s actually a great opportunity, but I don’t really want to step into the Thirteenth Realm. Too many restrictions; I prefer the freedom of my current immortal state. If the sky were to fall, let the tall man hold it up. For instance, our Tongyezhou used to be Tongye Sect, led by Du Mao. But now, whether I acknowledge it or not, I have to. As for why I won’t take that step into the Ascended Realm, I can’t say for certain yet. In time, you will understand.”

Xun Yuan swirled the wine in his glass. “But I am still the sect leader of Yuguizong, and I must think of my own people. With Du Mao’s death, his path to the Great Dao has collapsed and scattered. It’s not just about the pieces of the glazed golden body that you, Liu Laocheng, have managed to acquire. There are also those things that are beyond words, which we cultivators refer to as opportunities. So how much of the opportunity originally meant for me can Jiang Shangzhen seize, and how much can he take from the Tongye Sect disciples? It all comes down to skill and fortune.”

“If Jiang Shangzhen ends up with nothing and is driven back to this Shujian Lake, then Liu Laocheng, you can help out a bit for this useless fellow.”

“If Jiang Shangzhen turns out to be decent, that’s good too. A Yuguizong subordinate stationed in Baopingzhou, with two people hoping for the Immortal Realm, I believe even the Celestial Monarch Qi Zhen, the neighboring Guanhua Academy, or the Da Li Song clan wouldn’t dare to insult you.”

Liu Laocheng nodded.

These were the stark truths.

The reason Liu Laocheng himself had not established a sect in Shujian Lake was not merely due to despair. The intricacies were dangerous and distracting, with deep karmic consequences. A single misstep could delay or even obstruct the path to the Great Dao. Moreover, each time he advanced, whether in realm or cultivation, he had to consider the thoughts of those close to him, which were often filled with unspoken burdens. Liu Laocheng had suffered immensely in the past, nearly losing his life.

The yellow vine wine lay buried within the palace walls of the willow.

It was an old ledger, filled with muddled accounts.

Even a heart of iron like Liu Laocheng was reluctant to revisit those old matters.

Had he not thoroughly resolved his thoughts, and with a Yuguizong subordinate’s placement in Shujian Lake, he likely wouldn’t have returned to this sorrowful place for the rest of his life.

The longer he spent with Xun Yuan, the more apprehensive Liu Laocheng became.

This wasn’t just because Xun Yuan was an esteemed elder of the Immortal Realm.

It was an instinct that had helped Liu Laocheng navigate numerous perilous situations.

He refrained from taking drastic action against the clever Liu Zhimiao and that young accountant for another reason, one he hadn’t voiced to Gao Mian and Xun Yuan. Because doing so would render him passive. If the leverage was in Liu Zhimiao’s hands, it would be harmless; but if it lay with Xun Yuan and Jiang Shangzhen, Liu Laocheng would be flayed alive, bloodied, and forced to endure it. Otherwise, it would lead to a complete fallout, resulting in mutual destruction.

After stepping into the Fifth Realm, Liu Laocheng had grown increasingly silent, as the grand tapestry of his future unfolded before his eyes, revealing a harsh truth that left him pondering and shivering.

The struggle for the Great Dao.

It sounded vague.

But when a mountain-dwelling wild cultivator with enough cultivation and vision looked down at the narrow road beneath his feet and then glanced at the Five Realms cultivators on the same level, he would see the stark difference between a winding goat path and a wide thoroughfare.

Did Liu Laocheng truly not wish to become a grand sect master like Xun Yuan? Did he not desire to genuinely influence the course of the continent?

He simply felt powerless, unable to do so.

Xun Yuan smiled at the wild cultivator before him.

In Xun Yuan’s eyes, Liu Laocheng was a person burdened with luck and destiny. A rarity. An outstanding Yupu Realm cultivator, even Jiang Shangzhen, who excelled in combat and wielded a formidable life-bound object, might not be his rival.

Yet once he stepped into the Twelfth Realm, the Immortal Realm, Jiang Shangzhen could turn the tide.

Thus, Liu Laocheng’s role as the chief offering for Yuguizong's subordinate was just right. Jiang Shangzhen had a good nature, though he harbored a belly full of schemes, fundamentally, he was cut from the same cloth as Liu Laocheng; both were naturally wild cultivators who thrived in chaotic times.

Xun Yuan said gently, “Liu Laocheng, relax. I will ensure you smoothly step into the Immortal Realm. At that point, it won’t just be you raising a toast to me. In future gatherings, large or small, I will return the favor.”

Liu Laocheng raised his glass and laughed, “Then let’s toast to Elder Xun once more!”

Xun Yuan lightly clinked glasses with him, and they both downed their drinks, naturally, Liu Laocheng finished first while Xun Yuan savored his.

————

In a spacious room on the top floor of a tall building in Chishui City, Cui Dongshan repeatedly prepared to step out of the Thunder Pool, only to pull back his foot.

He hopped around, flapping his sleeves vigorously.

Like a large white goose flapping its wings in a chaotic dance.

The misty waters of Gongliu Island were now completely out of sight, including the landscape painting left behind by Cui Chan.

If a Confucian sage stationed above the skies of Baopingzhou wished to see, he could, but in matters that didn’t involve great significances, such behavior would be deemed “disrespectful,” even contrary to the principles of reason.

And this principle was so elevated that it became a rule of propriety, established by the Sage of Rites for the Confucian scholars, binding them hand and foot—it was quite amusing.

In fact, during the long years of Confucianism overseeing the world, there had been many shocking secret plots involving various schools of thought and great cultivators of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Realms, as well as demons and spirits, some of which were stillborn, but many caused immense destruction and far-reaching consequences.

Yet this rule remained unbending, firmly binding the Confucian scholars themselves.

Isn’t it absurd?
Don’t think that only the Sage of Rites is so unreasonable. The same kind of restrictions exists in places like Baiyu Jing and the Lotus Buddhist Kingdom.

Cui Dongshan stopped his movements and sat cross-legged in front of the chessboard again. He plunged his hands into the chess pots, stirring randomly, causing the colorful cloud pieces to clink against each other.

Even though Cui Dongshan couldn’t see what was happening on Gongliu Island, he still had to commend Xun Yuan for his actions that night, saying, “Jiang is still spicy when old; Liu Laocheng is still a bit green.”

Cui Dongshan plucked out a colorful cloud piece and struck it down heavily on the chessboard.

“He has hinted to Liu Laocheng. How he chooses is not only a mental test for a sect's offering but also a good deal for Liu Laocheng.”

“But these are mere trifles. Now, with the tides of fate rising, Shujian Lake has become the prime target for both the Da Li iron cavalry and the Zhu Ying dynasty’s interests. The impending battle that will determine the fate of the central region of Baopingzhou is about to erupt. Our overseer, one of the seventy-two wise men of the Confucian Temple, will undoubtedly be watching closely without batting an eye. Liu Laocheng, being a wild cultivator, may have instincts regarding the world’s trends, but the insider knowledge, dealings, and undercurrents he can access are far less than those of the Da Li national master.”

Cui Dongshan stared at the chess piece, chuckling coldly, “Liu Laocheng, so you still underestimate Xun Yuan’s cunning.”

Those few words exchanged on the peak of the vassal island were meant for the true behind-the-scenes figures. Some were direct, others indirect.

Cui Dongshan mumbled to himself, “First, Xun Yuan reminded you, Liu Laocheng. His implication was already leaning towards you. So whether you kill Chen Ping’an or show mercy, you will still owe Xun Yuan a debt of gratitude. This is human nature. Even my master, upon learning about this, might also appreciate Xun Yuan for his ‘righteous words.’”

Cui Dongshan took another piece and placed it on the board, “Secondly, not killing my master means Xun Yuan has gained good will from the crumbling legacy of the literature sage, which is now in turmoil and nearly extinguished. He has gained a favor without any effort. Even if the literature sage is perceptive, the facts remain. He has to acknowledge the essence of gentlemanly conduct; scholars have no choice.”

Cui Dongshan took another piece and casually tossed it onto the board, “Thirdly, that’s the real substantial benefit, immeasurable in value. Xun Yuan was speaking to the sage above, someone he has worked with before, and also to that sage who might not even have had enough to eat. Once the struggle for the Great Dao begins, even if Xun Yuan knows who stands behind Chen Ping’an, he would still take action.”

“Does he really think that merely handing over a jade tablet inscribed with ‘I can nurture the spirit of righteousness’ makes him immune? Of course not; he’s not angry with my master. On the contrary, this sage has a broad mind; otherwise, he wouldn’t have spoken such generous words back in Old Dragon City. But the more so, as one of the sages supervising the Baopingzhou, he would be even more displeased with the person who dared to strike first against the woman who threatens to expose the greatest secrets in the world.”

“Even such a sage, combined with the spirit of chivalry, feels this way. That pitiful fellow who was taken to the Confucian temple for closed-door reflection by the sub-sage must feel even more relieved. Should we not regard Xun Yuan with a higher opinion?”

“Establishing a subordinate sect from the main sect is always a challenging task. It’s not about money or strength, but whether the Confucian Academy agrees.”

Cui Dongshan shifted his gaze from the chessboard, glancing at the blurry Gongliu Island in the painting, “Liu Laocheng, how many words has Xun Yuan actually said? How much value has Yuguizong ultimately garnered?”

Cui Dongshan slammed the chessboard, sending four pieces flying high before gently falling back down.

Cui Dongshan tsked, “For cultivators, is cultivating the heart useless?”

With a wave of his sleeve, he sent the four chess pieces flying across the room, angrily exclaiming, “Damn it, including that old bastard, all of you hurry up and burn incense and bow down! Don’t let my master go through this heart calamity, or none of you will escape! Shujian Lake, Zhengyang Mountain, Qingfeng City, Zhenwu Mountain, Tongye Sect, Yuguizong, Da Li Song clan, Baiyu Jing…”

Cui Dongshan’s voice grew lower and lower, and finally, he fell into a daze for a long time, suddenly wailing, “That old bastard is right! My master has too many worries!”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 468: The Heart of Man is Like Water, Sinking Low

After quietly leaving the Booklet Lake, Xun Yuan headed straight out to sea instead of going to the southernmost Old Dragon City. Riding the winds, he returned to Tongyezhou.

Liu Zhimao and the island master of Li Su Island paid a joint visit to Gongliu Island.

The two stopped on the lake surface, a thousand zhang away from the island.

Liu Laocheng only saw the latter and told the former to scram.

Inside the tall buildings of Chi Shui City, Cui Dongshan was laughing heartily, rolling on the ground.

Once his joy subsided, Cui Dongshan's brow furrowed again as he lay down on the ground in a duck-like posture, “crawling” to the edge of the Golden Thunder Pool, sighing deeply. Truly, he was weaving a cocoon for himself.

He needed to find some entertainment to relieve his boredom.

Cui Dongshan sat up and tossed pieces onto the chessboard, coming to a conclusion about how much goodwill his master had received from those he encountered.

Qi Jingchun. Cui Dongshan tossed ten pieces onto the board, then rolled his eyes and said, “Just you have good taste, alright?”

Then, with a flick of his sleeve, he swept the pieces off the board.

Sword Spirit. Cui Dongshan didn’t toss even one piece, rolling his eyes again, muttering, “Still better than you, Qi Jingchun, alright?”

Only then did he throw six pieces onto the board.

He swept the pieces off again.

Old Yang. One piece.

Aliang. Five pieces.

Cui Dongshan pondered, “If we’re talking about Hongzhu Town…”

He added four pieces.

Left and right. Three pieces, and for Qi Jingchun’s sake, he added three more.

Wei Jin. None.

Ruan Qiong. Two pieces.

Cui Dongshan nearly calculated everyone Chen Pingan knew on the chessboard.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan erupted in fury, remembering he had overlooked the most detestable fellow, “The most heartless old scholar, you always show favoritism!”

He scooped up an entire jar of chess pieces and poured them onto the chessboard with a crash.

Cui Dongshan frowned, putting away the landscape painting, gathering all the pieces back into the jar, and said solemnly, “Come in.”

The owners of this tall building, the couple of the city lord of Chi Shui City, the Fan family, along with their foolish son Fan Yan, entered the room one after another.

Fan Yan bowed his head and followed his parents cautiously, as there were no chairs in the room.

Cui Dongshan was sitting, and the three of them couldn’t just stand there to talk, so they had to kneel and sit at a distance from Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan yawned.

The Fan family of Chi Shui City had once been double agents, selling information between the Da Li Song Clan and the Zhu Ying Dynasty. The authenticity of each piece of intelligence depended on which side—the Da Li Green Wave Pavilion’s spy chief or the Zhu Ying Dynasty’s fools—offered a higher price and had more cunning methods to manipulate people's hearts. In the end, the island master of Li Su Island proved to be much sharper than the Zhu Ying Dynasty’s intelligence officer responsible for this area. Ultimately, the Fan family chose to completely align themselves with the Da Li Iron Cavalry.

The man of the Fan family, the city lord of Chi Shui City, remained silent.

Instead, it was the Fan family matriarch, who was said to only know how to spend money and pamper her son, who spoke methodically about the situation at Booklet Lake and the recent movements of the Zhu Ying Dynasty’s border troops.

Cui Dongshan maintained a blank expression.

The woman didn’t dare to be the slightest bit negligent.

Because the national master of Da Li had left behind a weighty statement before departing, equating that lad on the rooftop with the vice ministers of the Da Li’s six departments.

After consulting with her husband, the woman concluded that the lad on the rooftop should at least be a Da Li Earth Immortal or a legitimate descendant of a prominent family.

She glanced at her husband beside her.

The city lord of Chi Shui City hurriedly stood up, bent over, and approached the edge of the strange and mysterious Golden Thunder Pool. He lowered his head and extended his hands, presenting a secret letter entrusted to the Fan family by the national master of Da Li, whispering, “The national master instructed me that if the young master has not left the rooftop by today, to present this letter.”

Cui Dongshan waved his hand, took the letter, tore open the envelope, tossed it aside, and upon reading its contents, his face darkened.

This scene made the Fan couple’s eyelids twitch.

How could they dare treat the national master’s secret letter with such disdain?

If they had received such an honor, they would have long revered it like a holy edict.

Cui Dongshan crumpled the letter into a ball, clenched it in his palm, cursing under his breath.

The content of the letter stated, “I previously said you have a short memory, and I’m sure you won’t accept it. How about now?”

“This circle is one you, Cui Dongshan, drew yourself. Do I really have to compete with you over this matter? When I finally said to you, ‘Cross the Thunder Pool, and don’t break the rules,’ it was aimed at you. So, if you step out of your circle and keep to the rules, what can I do? You’re the one who’s been stubborn, unknowingly trapping yourself, no different from Chen Pingan. If Chen Pingan can’t get out, you, as his disciple, really haven’t earned your keep. Birds of a feather flock together. When did you fall to the point where you need a Thunder Pool to uphold the rules?”

“Since you’re this pitiful, I’ll send you this letter; you can eat it. If that’s not enough, feel free to ask the Fan family for more.”

Cui Dongshan indeed stuffed the crumpled piece of paper into his mouth, chewing it up and swallowing it down.

Oh, the taste of rice paper, surprisingly good.

Cui Dongshan shook his head, pointed to the couple still kneeling beside him, “Fan Yan, right? Come out! Is playing dumb so much fun? Tell me, what do you think of that idiot Gu Can?”

The tall young man stood up, bowed respectfully, then stepped forward to sit in line with his parents, who clearly looked nervous, even carrying a hint of fear towards this “foolish” son.

Fan Yan’s expression was calm as he gazed directly at the white-clothed youth with a beauty mark between his brows, showing no signs of stage fright. He smiled and said, “That Gu Can, it’s quite simple. All he needs to do is act a little foolish, show deep affection for his parents, be a bit naive, and willing to suffer losses. Over time, if he hides it well and knows how to grasp the timing, that kid will believe it. To sell him off, I’m just waiting for someone who can pay the price. I didn’t expect Liu Laocheng to cause me to lose a hefty sum of celestial money, and I have nowhere to complain.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “A smart guy.”

Fan Yan replied, “Too bad there’s no great wisdom.”

Cui Dongshan laughed, asking, “Is that really how you think?”

Fan Yan was slightly taken aback.

Cui Dongshan stood up, hands clasped behind his back, and kicked away some debris on the edge of the Golden Thunder Pool, looking down at the young man, “If you want to live high up, you have to be prepared to endure greater highs and greater lows.”

“To live lightly, you can either play the fool or be truly foolish. Which one are you, Fan Yan? Think it over slowly; answer wrong, and tomorrow in the city lord’s mansion of Chi Shui City, we’ll hold a funeral where the white-haired send off the black-haired. Oh, my apologies, lord and lady of the city, you still seem young.”

Fan Yan’s face turned pale.

Cui Dongshan kept watching him with a smile.

Unexpectedly, Fan Yan suddenly smiled back, no trace of fear remaining.

Cui Dongshan tilted his head, coldly fixing his gaze on this Fan Yan who seemed to toy with Gu Can’s temperament, “Did that old bastard tell you early on not to worry about me venting my anger on you? You’re not going to die? Do you know what he really thinks? If you can’t even guess that, if you don’t even know who I am, who gave you the courage to speak to me like this?”

It was only at this moment that Fan Yan truly began to feel anxious.

Cui Dongshan sneered, “Da Li consuming Booklet Lake is a foregone conclusion. You, a spy who sells information, were indeed useful to our Da Li before and contributed quite a bit, but the benefits you were supposed to receive—every copper coin—has been given to you. But you, the Fan family, what about your collusion with the Zhu Ying Dynasty? Do you really think Da Li’s Green Wave Pavilion hasn’t kept records? What made you think you had a life-saving charm? Your looks? Huh?!”

As he stepped away from the Golden Thunder Pool, the entire tall building trembled.

A Nascent Soul cultivator!

Cui Dongshan strode over to Fan Yan, extending two fingers, sticking them together, looking down from a height, and coldly chuckled, “Crushing you, this trash, I’d find it dirty to get my hands involved. And you dare to act clever in front of me?”

Cui Dongshan turned his head towards the door, spitting, “Old bastard, I know what you’re thinking, letting this little bastard provoke me, stirring up all this pent-up thunderous rage to help you deal with that ninth realm sword cultivator of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, right?”

Cui Dongshan glared at the trembling couple nearby, “Raising such a useless son, you two, as parents, should teach him well. It’s not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. First, slap him a dozen or twenty times; make sure it sounds loud, or I’ll just slap you all dead. Damn it, don’t you people at Booklet Lake love a family reunion both above and below ground? With all these unpresentable, smelly rules, have you become addicted to them?”

The sound of slaps echoed through the room.

Much more pleasant than the sound of chess pieces being shuffled.

Finally, Cui Dongshan felt quite pleased.

He stepped out of the room, coming to the railing of the corridor, his expression somber. “Gu Can, oh Gu Can, do you really think you’re so impressive? Do you really know how ruthless this world is? Do you truly understand how Chen Pingan has survived until now? With your little mudfish, you’re destined to perish in Booklet Lake. Who gave you the courage to think your path could go far? Your master Liu Zhimao taught you this? Your mother taught you this? Do you have any idea how much my master has sacrificed for you?”

---

As dusk fell.

Chen Pingan carried the pot of yellow vine wine that had always been within arm’s reach and strolled to the entrance of Zhu Xian’s residence.

Hong Su walked out of the side room, smiling and waving, “Mr. Chen!”

Chen Pingan sat on the threshold with her just like that day when they listened to stories and wrote tales together.

Hong Su’s eyes sparkled as she turned around, giving a thumbs-up, “Mr. Chen, this!”

Chen Pingan’s expression darkened, his lips moved, yet he could still not bring himself to reveal the truth that would cut her heart like a knife.

The affairs of the world have never been simple.

It’s not always that speaking the truth and doing good will yield the best outcomes.

As for the current innkeeper Hong Su, she at least had no worries about life and death.

Would knowing the truth allow her to live better? Wouldn't it make her live in constant fear?

In this lifetime, Hong Su was indeed a kind-hearted woman with a soft disposition. Seeing this steward, she appeared somewhat saddened, mistakenly believing it was the tumultuous and emotional battles that had left Mr. Chen injured, which was why he seemed even more dispirited compared to their previous meeting. Moreover, there was such a domineering, terrifying, and unmatched enemy now residing on Gongliu Island, watching over Qingxia Island, so Mr. Chen must certainly be worried about the future.

Chen Pingan raised the yellow vine wine that Hong Su had gifted him and forced a smile. “I didn’t dare drink it before. Do you have a cup or bowl over there? Let’s have a drink of your hometown’s… side dish wine?”

Hong Su shyly replied, “I only have one bowl.”

She asked, “Should I go to the manor and ask for some wine utensils?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “No need, just use the bowl. I’ll drink straight from the pot.”

Hong Su’s face lit up with joy as she nimbly walked to the dim side room to fetch a white bowl. After she sat down, Chen Pingan had already removed the yellow paper seal and mud seal, turned sideways, and poured some wine for her.

Hong Su’s expression was strange as she stifled her laughter.

This Mr. Chen, really? He poured just this little bit of wine? In a bowl weighing about one tael, he poured wine, and now there’s only a bit more than one tael left?

After all, this wine was a gift from her.

She looked at him, then at the wine bowl, and poured a bit more.

Finally, Hong Su couldn’t hold it in any longer. With one hand holding the bowl and the other covering her mouth, she burst into laughter, the sound flowing through her fingers.

Chen Pingan began to laugh as well, and this time, when he poured the wine, he finally filled her bowl.

Hong Su smiled so wide that her sparkling eyes turned into crescent moons as she cradled the white bowl, sipping the wine in small mouthfuls.

Chen Pingan took a swig of the yellow vine wine.

The two didn’t chat much.

Hong Su was a bit curious about this wonderful Mr. Chen. The last time she jokingly asked about the girl he had hesitantly acknowledged, where was she now?

If she saw Mr. Chen, who now appeared so lonely, wouldn’t she feel heartbroken for him?

Chen Pingan took a sip of wine, gazing into the distance, softly saying, “Hong Su, we are friends, right?”

Hong Su nodded vigorously.

Chen Pingan responded with a soft “Mm,” as if telling her and also reminding himself, “So, in the future, no matter what happens, don’t be afraid. No matter how big the issue is, remember one thing quickly: at the mountain gate, there’s a steward named Chen, who is your friend.”

Hong Su felt a bit bewildered, but she was still very happy. She secretly turned her head to look at this steward beside her, who, as winter grew colder, had unknowingly changed into a thick green cotton coat.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 469: Sharpening the Sword While Not Training (Part 1)

On this day, someone from the Sword Room came to inform Chen Ping'an that a flying sword had arrived from afar at Qingxia Island. Chen Ping'an hurriedly left his house.

As expected, it was a reply from Zhong Kui.

Sure enough, upon reaching the Sword Room, which collected messages from all directions via flying swords, Chen Ping'an received a confidential letter from Taiping Mountain. Unfortunately, Zhong Kui mentioned in the letter that he had urgent matters to attend to. There were still demons causing trouble in various places at the foot of Tongye Continent, and while the situation wasn't as dangerous as before, it had become more insidious. It was like dealing with an endless horde of spirits and monsters. He was unable to leave for the time being, but he would come as soon as he found the opportunity. However, he hoped that Chen Ping'an would not hold onto any expectations, as Zhong Kui was bound to remain in Tongye Continent for now.

Worried, Chen Ping'an put away the letter. After stepping out of the Sword Room, he began to mutter to himself, humorously cursing Zhong Kui for being ungrateful. The letter was filled with an array of news similar to the reports from Shujian Lake—Yao Jinzhi's selection for the palace, the ups and downs of the three princes of the Great Spring, the blessings brought by the river goddess Hongfu, and the successful elevation of Biyoufu to Biyou Water God Palace, among other things. Yet, there was not a single mention of any method to summon spirits or resurrect the dead.

Not long after Chen Ping'an left the Sword Room, the island master Liu Zhimao arrived without warning. The monks in the Sword Room fell silent, as this was an unimaginable rarity. The Sword Master of the Jiang River had almost never entered this Sword Room; after all, the Yuan Ying island master had his own flying sword mound for sending and receiving messages, which was much more discreet and convenient. Moreover, Liu Zhimao lived a secluded life on Qingxia Island, only occasionally visiting the Spring Court where Gu Can resided, and only his direct disciple Tian Hujun and the island masters from the vassal islands had the chance to meet him.

With his hands clasped behind his back, Liu Zhimao bent forward, closely inspecting a flying sword from Taiping Mountain that was absorbing spiritual energy in a “feeding trough” on the sword rack, seemingly verifying the authenticity of the name "Taiping Mountain."

In Baoping Continent, every flying sword from a major sect often carried their sect's name inscribed using unique secret techniques. This alone served as a significant deterrent. For instance, in Baoping Continent, the Shen'ao Sect, the Wind and Snow Temple, and Zhenwu Mountain would all do the same. Additionally, the Thunderstorm Garden, which produced the extraordinary talent Li Tun Jing, also followed suit, with half of its flying swords personally engraved by Li Tun Jing's own life sword, inscribing the characters "Thunderstorm."

However, it was said that Li Tun Jing had already passed away, and the Thunderstorm Garden was now overseen by the young men Huang He and Liu Baqiao. With the relentless rise of their enemy, Zhengyang Mountain, even though Huang He was highly regarded and Liu Baqiao was considered promising, without Li Tun Jing, could the Thunderstorm Garden still be called the Thunderstorm Garden? Its current influence was certainly not what it used to be. Now, the cultivators on Baoping Continent were speculating about when the newly appointed garden master Huang He, who had astonished everyone at the Wind and Snow Temple, would truly shoulder the burden.

When encountering a flying sword engraved with a name, a small group of rogue cultivators who dared to intercept flying swords would generally return the sword upon seeing the name, not daring to break the restrictions and invite disaster upon themselves.

The other cultivators on the mountain were tacitly aware and wouldn’t have the audacity to engage in such behavior. Over at the Longquan Sword Sect, the Earth Immortal Dong Gu once suggested to Ruan Qiong that since they had now established themselves as a sect, perhaps they could inscribe names on their flying swords. Ruan Qiong, who rarely laughed and seldom showed his displeasure to his disciples, had an ashen face, causing Dong Gu to quickly retract his words. Ruan Qiong self-deprecatingly remarked, “A sect that doesn’t even have a Yuan Ying cultivator isn’t a proper sect at all.”

The head of the Sword Room mustered his courage and whispered, “Island Master, this flying sword not only bears the inscription ‘Taiping Mountain,’ but there are also characters carved on the other side of the sword.”

Liu Zhimao responded with an “mm,” extending a finger. With a gentle flick, the suspended flying sword turned slightly, revealing the characters “Zushi Hall.”

Liu Zhimao narrowed his eyes and sighed inwardly; it seemed that the accountant had made some impressive acquaintances in Tongye Continent.

Previously, Liu Zhimao had taken the initiative to set aside his pride, personally visiting to apologize, and had opened up a frank conversation with Chen Ping'an. Initially, he had been somewhat skeptical of Chen Ping'an's claim that “the Great Li still owed him something,” but now he was inclined to believe it a bit more, reducing his doubts.

The flying sword from Taiping Mountain’s Zushi Hall, belonging to the third greatest sect in Tongye Continent, was quite intimidating.

Although Liu Laocheng from Gongliu Island had long ceased to regard Shujian Lake with any seriousness, Liu Zhimao, who faced so many difficulties as the co-master of Shujian Lake, still had to weigh the matter carefully.

Cross-continent flying swords consumed a significant amount of spiritual energy, which was a considerable expense for cultivators.

The several responsible cultivators in the Qingxia Island Sword Room gathered to discuss this matter. Aside from the need to report the arrival of the flying sword from “Taiping Mountain” to Tian Hujun, they also debated whether to “casually” mention the matter of the few small summer coins. After weighing their options, everyone gritted their teeth and decided against bothering Tian Hujun with such trivial matters. In the end, the Sword Room collectively decided to cover the expenses of the small summer coins from their own pockets, sharing the burden for Qingxia Island to weather this crisis.

Liu Zhimao withdrew his gaze and turned to ask, “Did Mr. Chen say anything about the expenses incurred by the Sword Room for this flying sword?”

The head of the Sword Room shook his head, “Not at all. It seems Mr. Chen doesn’t quite understand the rules of the Sword Room.”

Liu Zhimao laughed and asked, “Did you hint to Mr. Chen about the rules? It wouldn’t hurt to explain them a bit; otherwise, the Sword Room will inevitably lose money in the future.”

The head of the Sword Room felt a chill in his heart and immediately replied, “The Sword Room has never hinted at anything!”

Liu Zhimao spoke to himself, “Mr. Chen is becoming increasingly familiar with us on Qingxia Island. Well, that’s actually a good thing.”

He then asked, “A couple of days ago, Mr. Chen sent two letters home, didn’t he?”

The head of the Sword Room nodded, “Both were sent via flying sword to Longquan County, though there were slight differences: one went to Piyun Mountain, and the other to Luopo Mountain.”

Liu Zhimao suddenly asked, “What do you all think of Mr. Chen? Is he easy to deal with?”

The cultivators in the Sword Room exchanged glances, and Liu Zhimao waved his hand, “Forget it, you won’t even reach that stage.”

Liu Zhimao stepped out, directly leaving the chaotic Sword Room filled with sword energy, returning to his residence, Hengbo Mansion.

Tian Hujun, who had previously reported the news to him, stood in place as Liu Zhimao said, “Proceed to find Mr. Chen as he requested, regardless of the manpower or resources involved. Treat it as Qingxia Island's top priority. Remember to keep it low-key, just get it done quietly, and bring him back to Qingxia Island. Mr. Chen is clever; he’s not dealing with the Spring Court, so there’s no need to overdo it.”

Tian Hujun nodded in acknowledgment, not uttering a single word of unnecessary chatter. After all, her master never appreciated such talk; a few words of flattery were worth less than even a minor accomplishment on the merit list, which her master would notice.

Liu Zhimao smiled, “Today, the Sword Room has managed to do something commendable. The four in charge have been quite smart. Go to the secret archives and erase their records of the private gains they’ve accumulated over the past hundred years. Consider the forty-odd summer coins they earned through misconduct as additional compensation for their efforts without merit.”

Tian Hujun nodded. Initially, according to her master’s established strategy, after becoming the sovereign of the jianghu, there would be a grand reward for the meritorious and a warning to the foolish, tackling both publicly and privately. However, with the emergence of Liu Laocheng from Gongliu Island, the former plan became ill-timed, and she could only delay and wait for the situation to clarify. Yet, some tactless individuals were stirring, causing the latter approach to be intensified. Anyone daring to provoke trouble at this moment risked severe repercussions, which could lead to dire consequences in these chaotic times.

Tian Hujun quietly left Hengbo Mansion.

Returning to her own mansion on Su Lin Island, she was greeted by a flurry of flattering voices from her followers, some genuine, but most insincere.

Tian Hujun felt neither fondness nor aversion to this. In Shujian Lake, if one didn’t act this way, they would either end up being a servant for life or, worse, slowly starve to death.

She instructed two of her trusted elders, who had moved with her to Su Lin Island, to inform the most experienced fishing office on Qingxia Island and two of her close associates from the vassal islands about Chen Ping'an’s request and Liu Zhimao’s instructions, collaborating to handle the matter well.

She then walked alone through a secret passage extending several miles, quietly arriving at her meditation chamber located in the heart of Su Lin Island, beneath the mansion. The deeper one went, the richer the concentration of spiritual energy became, with the so-called secret chamber merely beside an underground river, featuring a single chair. The entire underground area glowed with a faint green hue indicative of water energy, while the ceiling walls exuded strands of moon-white light that flowed into the carved dragon mouths of the chair.

As Tian Hujun sat on the dilapidated old dragon chair, taking a deep breath and feeling intoxicated, streams of dragon energy and spiritual water energy surged into her palms, flooding into her several innate energy reservoirs, stirring the spiritual energy and honing her cultivation.

Tian Hujun’s face contorted, a mix of pain and pleasure evident.

She was drenched in fragrant sweat.

An hour later, Tian Hujun opened her eyes, exhaling a heavy breath of foul, stagnant air. She waved her sleeve lightly, sending that air into the underground river, ensuring it would not taint the precious spiritual energy of this place.

Feeling slightly fatigued yet immensely satisfied, Tian Hujun reflected on the arduous path of cultivation. The hardships could be terrifying, but the joys far surpassed the fleeting affections of mortal love. Thus, the vows exchanged between men and women, which might seem profound, were merely trifles for cultivators in the fifth realm of Qi training, especially for Earth Immortals. However, nothing is absolute; if the Great Path itself involved matters of the heart, even Yuan Ying cultivators would find themselves mired in mud, unable to escape the burdens.

Li Tun Jing from the Thunderstorm Garden serves as the best example of this.

With his astonishingly gifted talent for cultivation, he should have ascended to the upper five realms of sword immortals long before Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple.

Once he reached the Jade Purity Realm and crossed that chasm, the realm of immortality might very well be within his grasp.

At that time, who would be the true first local cultivator of Baoping Continent? Would a twelfth realm sword cultivator be enough?

One must remember that the current leader among the cultivators of Baoping Continent, the Taoist Heavenly Monarch Qi Zhen, has just recently reached the Immortal Realm.

Yet, this flamboyant figure, who occupied the sword path's fortunes across the continent, happened to be unable to cross a threshold that someone like Tian Hujun would not care much about.

The Great Path is truly unpredictable, and this is precisely it.

Tian Hujun collected her thoughts and began to carefully contemplate her future.

The scenery atop the Great Path is infinitely beautiful, but one cannot simply admire the grand landscapes of others; she too should become the envy of others, which is the right path to take.

In her mind flashed the image of her little junior brother lying on a sickbed.

Tian Hujun's emotions became complex.

After standing up, she shook off the sweat stains from her dress.

Taking a few steps forward, she stood by the riverside, lost in thought.

Among Liu Zhimao and Gu Can, her heart leaned more towards the junior brother Gu Can than the deep-minded master who would kill anyone for the Great Path, often leaving them bewildered, unaware of the reasons even in death. That was the most terrifying aspect.

In contrast, Gu Can, though unruly and not skilled in business, was someone Tian Hujun found it easier to invest in emotionally, as long as she persisted; she was likely to receive unexpected rewards. After all, her junior brother was still a child, capable of navigating seemingly tangled webs of influence while still lacking a true understanding of the fundamental connections hidden beneath the waters of Shujian Lake. Those were the true rules of Shujian Lake. Gu Can didn’t know how to use people, only how to kill; he wouldn’t maintain what he had, only seeking to advance, which ultimately was not a long-term strategy.

Thus, reason told Tian Hujun that while she could place heavy bets on Gu Can, she absolutely could not gamble her entire fortune on him; he loved to take risks too much.

She was far from being able to compete with her master Liu Zhimao and likely would never see that day in her lifetime.

Tian Hujun felt a deep sense of regret, lamenting that her junior brother Gu Can could establish a small territory in just three years, yet upon reaching a high position, he hadn’t considered how to defend it. She could teach him bit by bit, sharing the insights she had painstakingly cultivated over two hundred years, but Gu Can's rapid growth had caught even Liu Zhimao and all of Shujian Lake off guard. How could Gu Can possibly heed Tian Hujun’s advice? Perhaps if he were to spend decades refining his character, he might truly be able to stand on equal footing with his master Liu Zhimao.

But then Liu Laocheng arrived.

In an instant, he had knocked Gu Can and his mud eel back to square one.

Historical texts speak of the power of local warlords, of land and soldiers, of life and death.

However, one cannot turn a blind eye; Shujian Lake is merely a corner of Baoping Continent, now facing a new pattern that hasn’t been seen in a millennium, with great risks and great opportunities coexisting.

Whether it be the Great Li Iron Cavalry or the Zhu Ying Dynasty, whoever ultimately becomes the sovereign of Shujian Lake will want a “vassal king” who can adequately control the situation there. If they cannot achieve that, even if they become the sovereign of the jianghu, they will be replaced—such changes can happen in the blink of an eye.

Tian Hujun never thought her junior brother Gu Can was doing poorly; in fact, he had already made her feel a sense of awe and respect. Yet, it seemed he still wasn’t good enough, and time was not on their side.

Now that the overwhelming tide was approaching, what should they do?

Suddenly, Tian Hujun thought of the young accountant living at the mountain gate.

Could he truly provide a slight delay to prevent the flood tide from drowning Shujian Lake and Qingxia Island? Could he really remedy the situation?

Tian Hujun shook her head.

It was too difficult.

 ### Chapter 470: Sharpening the Sword When Not Practicing (Part 2)

Chen Ping'an returned to his room and sat down at his desk, where all the files he needed to gather and organize were already prepared.

For the time being, the ghostly souls and spirits he could collect had been negotiated with the practitioners from Moonhook Island (Yuegou Dao) and Yuhudao Island. The ghost cultivator Ma Yuanzhi from Zhu Xian Mansion (Zhu Xian Fu) had yet to agree to sell, but he promised to gather and filter the spirits. Once Chen Ping'an completed his task, Zhu Xian Mansion would be ready to present all the spirits they had prepared. By then, the price would be determined—however, as time passed, Chen Ping'an encountered more and more setbacks with Liu Chongrun on Zhu Chai Island (Zhu Chai Dao). It seemed that the ghost cultivator Ma Yuanzhi was also feeling disheartened, and the negotiations were beginning to ease up. As long as Chen Ping'an could persuade Liu Chongrun to step foot on Qingxia Island (Qingxia Dao), he could hand over half of the spirits he had collected from the Soul-Calling Banner and the well as a sort of deposit.

The letter Chen Ping'an sent to Wei Bo of Piyun Mountain (Piyun Shan) mainly inquired about the potential purchase of a mountain, along with a few other small matters for which he sought Wei Bo's assistance.

In the letter to Zhu Lian, he reassured him not to worry—he was safe at Shu Jian Lake and there was no danger. There was no need for Zhu Lian to come looking for him. He also asked Zhu Lian to remind Pei Qian to stay safe in Longquan County and not forget to invite the young boy in a green robe and the girl in a pink skirt to keep vigil at the ancestral home in Niping Alley on New Year's Eve. If they were worried about the cold, they should buy some better charcoal from the town, light a stove for warmth during the vigil, and if they felt sleepy after midnight, they could go to sleep. However, they must not forget to put up Spring Festival couplets and the character for 'fortune' the next day. There was no need to spend money on them; the elderly Cui on the second floor of the bamboo building had excellent calligraphy skills, so they could just ask him to write them. There was still enough red paper from last year that had not been used. The girl in the pink skirt knew where it was kept. Finally, he reminded Pei Qian to be careful with the firecrackers on the morning of the first day of the new year—don’t go overboard. The yards in Niping Alley were small, and the alleys narrow, so they shouldn’t set off too many firecrackers. If they wanted more excitement, they could return to Piyun Mountain to set them off; it wouldn’t matter how many they had there. If they found it troublesome to chop bamboo and make firecrackers, they could easily buy them from the shops in town. It was a small expense, and there was no need to be overly frugal. As for the New Year’s red envelopes, even if Chen Ping'an was not at his hometown, he would still prepare some. On the first or second day, his friend, the Mountain Deity Wei Bo, would make an appearance, and everyone would get their share. However, when asking for the red envelopes, no one was allowed to forget to say a few auspicious words; it was especially important to be respectful to Mr. Wei.

Chen Ping'an picked up a small cone brush made from purple bamboo from a wooden pen holder, breathed lightly on it, but paused for a moment. He put down the brush, feeling a headache coming on, more so from guilt.

The pen holder on the desk was something Chen Ping'an crafted himself, and the brush was a gift from the island master of Purple Bamboo Island (Zi Zhu Dao). At that time, Chen Ping'an had shamelessly asked for three rods of purple bamboo, and the island master, being extremely generous, gifted him two specially crafted brushes from Purple Bamboo Island. They were made from the finest quality bamboo, with a fine tip and a small section of transparent bristles, truly exquisite. This was a secret technique of the island master. Even a Qi-refining cultivator from the Lower Five Realms could easily write with it by simply exhaling a breath of spiritual energy (Qi); the ink would flow smoothly, its fragrance filling the air, and the paper could naturally resist pests for a hundred years. Thus, this "Lake Bamboo Brush" became a coveted item, widely sold throughout the Zhu Ying Dynasty, favored by the nobility. Even if it was just displayed on the pen holder, it was enough to please the owner.

Chen Ping'an had blushingly accepted the gift, asking for two small calligraphy brushes best suited for writing delicate characters.

It was similar to the small snow cone brush gifted to him by Li Xisheng back in the day. With a single breath, if he exhaled too much spiritual energy, he could just rest the brush on the pen holder or on the stand without a single drop of “ink” falling off. If he ran out of ink while writing, he would only need to exhale lightly again; it was quite convenient. Furthermore, if the brush was aligned with one’s elemental attributes, the ink could even change colors, which made it extremely practical. Thus, it became a favorite among the female cultivators on the mountain for their correspondence.

Chen Ping'an had not practiced martial arts or refined Qi for quite some time, and after the grand duel with Liu Lao Cheng, his body was slowly healing. Yet, it was only at this moment that he realized his two core Qi chambers had depleted spiritual energy to such an extent. The cavity that originally held his golden literary essence was now in ruins, broken beyond repair. No need to mention that, in order to grasp that sword immortal, he had caused great upheaval in the “Water Mansion” filled with little green-clad figures. The impact was far greater than Chen Ping'an had anticipated, leading to an actual depletion of spiritual energy in the Water Mansion.

Without hesitation, Chen Ping'an stood up and took the almost universally known ordinary ferry that everyone at Shu Jian Lake recognized and headed to Su Lin Island to pay a visit to Tian Hu Jun.

The steward at the mansion courteously replied that the island master was in closed-door meditation and could not say when he would appear. He dared not disturb her but promised that if there was an urgent matter, he would notify the island master even at the risk of punishment afterward.

Half of the meditation was a major taboo in cultivation.

Chen Ping'an was no novice in the world, so he quickly smiled at the old cultivator, whose face was full of “heroic sacrifice,” and said that he had no urgent matters. He had simply visited Su Lin Island a few times and had not yet had the chance to sit down and have a proper chat with Master Tian. He felt he had troubled her a lot during this time and was merely here to express his gratitude today, so there was no need to disturb her meditation.

The steward let out a sigh of relief. Just as Chen Ping'an was about to leave, he suddenly asked with a smile, “I’ve heard that your mansion has a collection of the renowned girl’s tea from Cao E Island. Since I’ve come all this way, could I trouble you for a cup of tea to moisten my throat before I leave? If Master Tian is upset afterward, you can just say I was being persistent, threatening not to leave without tea, which caused you to incur some expense.”

The old cultivator chuckled broadly, quickly leading this account manager into the mansion. Soon, they presented a pot of naturally moisture-rich Cao E Island girl’s tea.

As Chen Ping'an sipped the tea, he chatted casually with the old cultivator.

Their conversation flowed pleasantly.

After bidding farewell, the old cultivator personally escorted him to the Su Lin Island ferry, waving vigorously at the account manager as they parted ways.

On the way back, the old cultivator walked proudly, his face glowing with the warmth of spring even in the depths of winter.

Today, he really felt like he had gained some face.

After leaving Su Lin Island, Chen Ping'an didn’t return to Qingxia Island right away but instead headed to Zhu Chai Island.

A pot of Cao E Island tea could only do so much to aid the Water Mansion’s spiritual energy; he still needed to purchase some specially crafted medicinal pills that concentrated the water energy.

Since Tian Hu Jun was in closed-door training, he could only seek out Liu Chongrun.

Rumor had it that Liu Chongrun had secretly hoarded many valuable items from the royal treasury after the destruction of her homeland. More importantly, Chen Ping'an did not trust anyone at Shu Jian Lake.

After chatting with Ma Yuanzhi from Zhu Xian Mansion and analyzing the history and relationships surrounding Shu Jian Lake, he discovered that Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island was the type of cultivator who conducted business fairly; there had been no scandals associated with her for over two hundred years.

If Liu Chongrun came from a royal family, she must have been exceptionally skilled at hiding. Over two hundred years, not a single hint had leaked, and she even had someone behind the scenes capable of predicting her sudden intention today to purchase medicinal pills from Liu Chongrun. Chen Ping'an would admit defeat.

Liu Chongrun still did not meet with him personally today.

This was to be expected; she was probably simply tired of the poor matchmaking attempts of this account manager.

Previously, on two occasions when Chen Ping'an had docked, Liu Chongrun had sent one of her exceptionally beautiful disciples to “intercept” him at the ferry, and he had failed to remember the name. The way things were run on Zhu Chai Island was relatively clean, especially when compared to Yun Yu Island (Yunyu Dao), which had a similar gathering of female cultivators but was mocked by male cultivators of Shu Jian Lake as the “brothel island.” The reputations of the two were worlds apart. When Chen Ping'an had landed there, he had only wanted to learn some information from the island master Liu Chongrun. He had no interest in any interactions with the other cultivators on Zhu Chai Island.

This wasn’t because Chen Ping'an was overly proud; he simply understood that every action he took at Shu Jian Lake could lead to unpredictable outcomes. Even good deeds would merely embellish a situation; however, bad outcomes could bring disaster.

In life, once one fell into a predicament, it was inevitable to slide down a slippery slope, often resulting in being caught between a rock and a hard place, making one feel utterly lost.

At this moment, aside from carefully considering his own interests and losses, as well as cautiously weighing how to break through the predicament, if he could also think a bit more about the people around him, it might not provide a perfect solution, but at least he wouldn’t make things worse.

Chen Ping'an explained his intentions.

The elegantly poised young female cultivator asked with a smile, “Mr. Chen, are you really not here to act as an intermediary for that ghost cultivator?”

Chen Ping'an nodded affirmatively, “I’m really not.”

She seemed a bit frustrated, stamping her foot lightly, and complained, “Mr. Chen, you’ve cost me ten snowflake coins!”

Chen Ping'an replied helplessly, “If I said you deserved it, could I still go meet your island master?”

The young female cultivator reluctantly replied, “You could.”

Chen Ping'an then said, “You deserve it.”

From a distance, many female cultivators of Zhu Chai Island, who had been hiding and eavesdropping, erupted into laughter, most of them being Liu Chongrun’s direct disciples or some recent arrivals who dared to be so bold due to their youth.

The young female cultivator retorted, “Can’t you just go to Baoguang Pavilion on the mountain peak by yourself?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “I can.”

After passing through the mountain gate, she truly left him behind and ran to the side room of the mountain gate to whisper with her fellow female disciples. Then, along with a few other girls who had misjudged their bets, they obediently handed over their snowflake coins to the winners.

A fortunate girl, hands full of coins, poked her head out and laughed loudly at the young account manager's back, “Mr. Chen, thanks!”

As the account manager slowly climbed the mountain, he did not turn back but raised his hand to wave, signaling that there was no need for thanks.

In the side room by the mountain gate, seven or eight young female cultivators, regardless of winning or losing, burst into laughter.

In Baoguang Pavilion, Chen Ping'an saw Liu Chongrun dressed in luxurious palace attire. They sat facing each other, and she skillfully prepared tea, each movement exuding true wealth and grace.

No wonder it was said that the Spring Court had invited Liu Chongrun twice earlier, but she had politely declined both times.

Liu Chongrun asked, “Mr. Chen, aren’t you even a little worried about your health?”

Chen Ping'an replied straightforwardly, “I am. That’s why I came to Zhu Chai Island. I want to buy some spirit pills suitable for nourishing my Qi chambers. If I remember correctly, in the past, you had a Water Palace and a dragon boat personally crafted by you when you ruled your kingdom. Both were renowned in the central region of Baoping Continent.”

Liu Chongrun nodded, “I have spirit pills suitable for nurturing the water energy of the Earth Immortal Qi chambers and core items. Not only do I have them, but I also have more than one type. However, it’s no longer a matter of high or low price. In Shu Jian Lake, I cannot dare to sell such rare treasures. Once they become public, unless I can continuously supply them, it would lead to a dead end. I believe with Mr. Chen’s intellect, you can understand the crux of the matter.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “If I were in your position, I too would find them too hot to handle. Unless in a desperate situation, I would not dare to exchange them for Gu Yu coins.”

Liu Chongrun handed him a cup of misty, steaming tea from Hongyin Island. Under the sunlight, the teacup revealed a petite rainbow the length of a finger.

Liu Chongrun smiled and asked, “Since you are a man of understanding, then why should I state a price?”

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment, “Then what would it take for you to be willing to quote a price?”

Liu Chongrun’s expression grew serious, “Zhu Chai Island wants to relocate from Shu Jian Lake. What’s your opinion on that?”

Chen Ping'an curiously asked, “Zhu Chai Island has never involved itself in conflicts and has always maintained neutrality, with hardly any enemies. So, the final ownership of Shu Jian Lake, whether it becomes the domain of the Song family of the Great Li or the Zhu Ying Dynasty, doesn’t seem to affect you much. Zhu Chai Island merely misses out on a piece of the pie without attracting trouble. Afterward, as Shu Jian Lake stabilizes, its rules will increasingly resemble those of a feudal dynasty, and you, Master Liu, are most familiar with such rules. Why are you insistent on relocating?”

Liu Chongrun held the teapot with both hands, her gaze lowered, with a hint of tea steam resting on her eyelashes, giving her a refreshing appearance.

Chen Ping'an cradled his teacup in one hand and supported the porcelain cup, as blue as rain-washed skies, with the other, always gazing at the island master of Zhu Chai Island.

There was no trace of ulterior motives, nor a hint of pity.

Liu Chongrun slightly raised her head, meeting his gaze. After a moment, she was the first to lower her eyes, taking a sip of tea. “I fear that the royal family of the Zhu Ying Dynasty will ultimately gain control of Shu Jian Lake. Some seemingly absurd palace secrets are actually the truth.”

Chen Ping'an began to rummage through his memories regarding the Zhu Ying Dynasty, Zhu Chai Island, and the past of Liu Chongrun’s homeland.

From Qingxia Island to Shu Jian Lake, viewing him as merely an account manager was not entirely a joking title.

However, many of the secrets surrounding Shu Jian Lake, tucked away in the cabinets of the mountain gate, and some fragmented historical accounts, were too disjointed, and various rumors could easily muddy the truth.

Chen Ping'an thought long and hard but could not discern a coherent narrative.

After all, Zhu Chai Island was not the key “battleground” that Chen Ping'an needed to focus on; he still knew too little.

Liu Chongrun asked a question that should never have been asked at Shu Jian Lake, “Can I trust Mr. Chen’s character?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head and nodded slowly, “Don’t trust my character, but compared to the usual trading style of the wild cultivators at Shu Jian Lake, who are prone to turning their backs and are skilled in underhanded dealings, doing business with me, Chen Ping'an, would certainly be a little better, just a little.”

Liu Chongrun smiled bitterly, “Just because Mr. Chen has never used his power to bully others and has endured being turned away at the dock so many times without showing a hint of anger, I’m willing to believe in your character.”

Chen Ping'an took a sip of tea and looked at Liu Chongrun, “Is it that Zhu Chai Island's potential calamity is too great, already beyond what you can bear, so you have to take a gamble on my character?”

The old cultivator felt a bit awkward as Chen Ping'an had exposed her hidden calculations.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Are you thinking of relocating to the mountains west of Longquan County?”

Chen Ping'an continued, “Zhu Chai Island has few cultivators, and the only visible Earth Immortal is you, Master Liu. By moving to the spiritually rich Longquan County, you could establish roots on a couple of smaller mountains, aligning yourself with the Song family. Not to mention distancing from the chaos of the central Baoping Continent; even if the Zhu Ying Dynasty wins the war, it would be difficult for them to find trouble with you in the Great Li.”

At first, Liu Chongrun listened intently, not wanting to miss a single word. But as Chen Ping'an continued, a hint of annoyance crossed her face, and she glared at him fiercely.

Chen Ping'an found it strange, “What’s wrong?”

Liu Chongrun gazed at the young man in the cotton robe, staring into his eyes as if trying to find a clue, and then she might lose her temper and issue an eviction order.

Liu Chongrun couldn’t find any clues. She held her breath but ultimately could not restrain herself. “Chen Ping'an! You’ve truly never heard of the ancient grudges between the Zhu Ying Dynasty and my homeland?”

Chen Ping'an frowned and replied, “What I know about Master Liu is mostly what Ma Yuanzhi from Zhu Xian Mansion told me, primarily about your past glories. I haven’t heard much about the grievances with the Zhu Ying Dynasty. I only know that the ghost cultivator Ma Yuanzhi harbors a deep enmity towards the Zhu Ying Dynasty and has secretly infiltrated their borders multiple times to assassinate several border generals, becoming a source of several unsolved cases for the Zhu Ying Dynasty. But what hidden feelings lie within that, I truly do not know.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Master Liu, are you afraid of a certain powerful figure from the Zhu Ying Dynasty? Is this related to the downfall of your homeland?”

Liu Chongrun threw the teacup in her hand to the ground, shattering it with a loud bang.

This woman, with a life full of legend, took a deep breath. Seeing the young man across from her still calm, Liu Chongrun sighed, feeling self-mockery, “I’m sorry, I didn’t cultivate my heart well enough and lost my composure in front of Mr. Chen.”

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, indicating it was fine.

Liu Chongrun slowly said, “There was an ancient Earth Immortal sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Do you know that during his envoy’s visit to my capital, can you imagine? In his foreign land, I, Liu Chongrun, was almost a dignified ruler, just a dragon robe away from being humiliated in my palace. Not a single palace guard or court official dared to stop him. He didn’t succeed, but as he leisurely put on his pants, he intentionally made a motion and left a remark, saying I would eventually understand the meaning of ‘long reach’ and what it meant to have a ‘long whip between the legs’ that could cross two nations. When our kingdom was destroyed, he just happened to be in closed-door training; otherwise, Mr. Chen, you probably wouldn’t be enjoying this cup of tea at Shu Jian Lake today. But now, this person is a powerful governor of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, a de facto emperor of a vassal state, ironically adjacent to Shu Jian Lake!”

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Liu Chongrun gritted her teeth, making a resolution. She slightly lifted her hips, straightened her chest, and said in a deep voice, “As long as Mr. Chen agrees to secure a mountain in Longquan County and expedite Zhu Chai Island’s relocation, I, Liu Chongrun, am willing to offer myself! Today, if you, Chen Ping'an, wish, it can happen right here and now!”

Her gaze was open and bold.

Chen Ping'an's expression remained calm, like an ancient well without ripples.

Then he asked a question that was even more disheartening than a flat-out rejection, “Why not look for Liu Zhimiao or Liu Lao Cheng?”

Liu Chongrun’s face fell slightly, but her eyes quickly regained their fighting spirit, sneering, “If I looked for Liu Zhimiao, once he grew bored, he would definitely sell me to the Zhu Ying Dynasty. As for Liu Lao, I probably wouldn’t even get to see him. Even if Liu Lao Cheng is willing to meet me, as soon as I dared to speak, I’d be turned into a pile of mush with a slap!”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Has Master Liu ever had a man she liked?”

Liu Chongrun shook her head, “Never! If I had, I, Liu Chongrun, would rather die than say something like offering myself!”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “It seems you really haven’t. Otherwise, if you had someone you truly liked, you wouldn’t say such ridiculous things to me.”

Liu Chongrun, firing up in anger, retorted, “Chen Ping'an, don’t push your luck! A gentleman can be killed but cannot be humiliated. Even though I, Liu Chongrun, am a woman, I won’t fall to the level of being lectured and humiliated by you!”

Chen Ping'an took a sip of tea, feeling helpless. “Isn’t it said that in business, even if the deal doesn’t go through, there should still be a sense of righteousness?”

Liu Chongrun calmed down a bit but still couldn’t shake off her embarrassment, angrily saying, “Men are all the same, either full of dirty thoughts, wanting every woman to be their plaything, or being sanctimonious like you—both are detestable!”

Chen Ping'an handed over an empty teacup, gesturing for a refill. Liu Chongrun replied in irritation, “Can’t you do it yourself?”

Chen Ping'an had to pour a cup of tea for himself and didn’t forget to fill another cup for her, gently handing it over. Liu Chongrun took the porcelain cup and downed it in one go, as if it were fine wine.

As long as one party remained calm, it was not easy for the other to escalate the fire.

After Liu Chongrun poured herself another cup of tea and took a slow sip, Chen Ping'an finally asked, “Does Master Liu hate Ma Yuanzhi so much just because of his former identity as a menial worker? I doubt that; you’re not that kind of person.”

Liu Chongrun replied slowly, “He’s ugly; even just glancing at him makes me feel disgusted. It was like that back then, and it’s still like that now. His dog eyes like to roam over women’s chests and backsides, the bigger, the better! The more noble the woman’s status, the more he salivates over her!”

Chen Ping'an decided to refrain from speaking.

He absolutely would not comment.

And he planned to stay out of it in the future.

Liu Chongrun set down her teacup, sneering, “It’s not because men do many things for us women that we must like them. There’s no such logic in the world!”

However, Liu Chongrun sighed, “But he has done so much; of course, I’m aware of every bit of it. Otherwise, do you think I would have endured him hanging that Zhu Xian Mansion plaque for so many years? It’s just that sometimes, recalling those feelings, I can’t help but be moved, unrelated to romance… But then I think of his mouth full of crooked, yellow teeth, and I truly lose my appetite.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 471: Sharpening the Sword in Times of Inaction (Part 2)

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Liu Chongrun, however, had no intention of letting this young accountant off the hook. He cast a sidelong glance at Chen’s pale, thin face. “If Mr. Chen looked like that crooked gourd, do you think I’d be willing to show up at the ferry so many times? I’d be lucky to see you once or twice. Do you think women from the market and female cultivators from the mountains enjoy looking at ugly men? It’s just like how men can’t help but steal glances at beautiful women. The only difference is whether a man can control his thoughts and desires.”

Liu Chongrun lifted his teacup, slowly sipping his tea, then asked with a smile, “I wonder if Mr. Chen can control his desires and thoughts?”

Chen Ping'an’s eyes were clear as he replied, “There’s no need to.”

Liu Chongrun sensed the honesty in his response, yet felt a pang of frustration and discouragement. “Are you really that much of a mud Buddha? Or is it that I, Liu Chongrun, have already aged and lost my charm?”

Chen Ping'an set down his teacup and said, “Since you, Island Master Liu, have made your offer, I can try to make contact with the Great Li side.”

Liu Chongrun lowered his voice, “The Island Master of Li Zuo Island?”

Chen Ping'an did not play coy; he nodded lightly.

Both were insightful individuals here at Shujian Lake.

Liu Chongrun reminded him, “Let’s make this clear: Mr. Chen, don’t make things worse for us, or you’ll end up harming Zhu Chai Island.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I’ll be careful. Even if I can’t resolve your urgent issue, I certainly won’t make things worse for Zhu Chai Island.”

Liu Chongrun narrowed his eyes in thought. “I wonder where Mr. Chen’s confidence comes from to say such things?”

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping'an responded plainly, “Compared to what I’m currently doing, Zhu Chai Island’s fate is merely a small bonus that can benefit all three parties involved.”

Liu Chongrun’s expression shifted.

Chen Ping'an’s hands were nestled in his sleeves, “Don’t believe me? Zhu Chai Island is already gambling. Since we’re gambling, there’s no way back. It’s best to believe, even if it’s just a desperate hope. Let’s treat me as a quack doctor; perhaps it will bring unexpected joy, much better than me playing matchmaker.”

Liu Chongrun suddenly showed a naive smile, as if the sun had risen in the west. “If I were to back out now, can we just consider it a tea session, and I’d be free of this?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Of course, it’s still possible. I’m not Liu Chongrun; I’m still a businessman who values transactions over righteousness.”

Liu Chongrun gritted his teeth in frustration. This young man was utterly immune to his provocations!

Liu Chongrun raised her hands, with her elbows intentionally creating an alluring silhouette. She smiled sweetly at Chen Ping'an, clapped her hands, and asked him to wait a moment.

Shortly after, a frail old woman entered the courtyard, holding a porcelain vial. She respectfully handed it to Liu Chongrun and silently exited.

Chen Ping'an understood that this unassuming old woman, despite her decaying aura, was the very foundation that allowed Zhu Chai Island to stand tall.

Perhaps Liu Chongrun had managed to escape a calamity in the royal palace of her own capital years ago thanks to this elderly woman.

Liu Chongrun tossed the vial to Chen Ping'an. “Mr. Chen, be careful with this. It’s one of the best elixirs from the Water Palace’s secret stash. It can greatly replenish the spiritual energy of the Water Mansion and repair water-type innate objects. Just throwing this vial into Shujian Lake will create towering waves that any Golden Core earth immortal would envy. This is a deposit, a show of sincerity from Zhu Chai Island. Now it depends on whether you have the miraculous ability to turn decay into wonder. If this works out, the four characters I mentioned before will remain valid until I leave Shujian Lake. Once I move to Longquan County, they’ll be worthless. Time waits for no one!”

Chen Ping'an ignored the latter part of her statement and opened the vial on the spot, pouring out a verdant elixir. After closing his eyes for a moment, he opened them again and smiled slightly at Liu Chongrun before swallowing it whole.

Liu Chongrun asked curiously, “This elixir hasn’t been tampered with, but how can you be so sure so quickly?”

Chen Ping'an certainly wouldn’t divulge the secret behind the group of green-robed water sprites dwelling in his Water Mansion. He casually replied, “Since I’m here at Shujian Lake, I’ll abide by local customs and bet big for a big win.”

Liu Chongrun raised an eyebrow but didn’t say much more.

Chen Ping'an then inquired, “I’d like to ask about the detailed history of your homeland and the Zhu Ying Dynasty. This might take up quite a bit of your time. Is that alright?”

Liu Chongrun looked puzzled. “Why is that? Is it related to your upcoming plans?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “Not really; I just want to know the perspectives of those involved on certain… major issues. I’ve only been a bystander, listening to similar dialogues before, but I didn’t feel much. Now I want to know a bit more.”

Liu Chongrun hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Alright, although it doesn’t sit well with me to relive old grievances, since I’ve already shared those sordid tales with you, the other matters of court and battlefield are nothing in comparison.”

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands in gratitude.

Liu Chongrun shot him a playful eye roll.

Chen Ping'an ignored it.

For the next two hours, Liu Chongrun recounted the rise and fall of her homeland, from the establishment of the Longxing Dynasty, gradual decline, revival efforts, to the ultimate collapse, speaking candidly.

Liu Chongrun was no longer that long princess; she was now a Golden Core cultivator at Shujian Lake, speaking openly. Chen Ping'an listened intently, silently taking notes, benefiting greatly. When Liu Chongrun hit on key points or areas of confusion, he would ask her to elaborate.

This made Liu Chongrun feel awkward and amused within, wondering how she ended up playing the role of a teacher to such a diligent student. It was a feeling she had never experienced before.

Just when Liu Chongrun thought there was nothing more to say.

Chen Ping'an mentioned that he would like to visit Baoguang Pavilion next and ask Liu Chongrun more about transportation and the government officials involved.

Liu Chongrun laughed angrily. “Chen Ping'an, are you annoying or what?! If you want to get into my bed, why not just say it directly? Why do you have to beat around the bush? Is it fun? You want both body and heart? Wow, your appetite is bigger than anyone else’s! Those two old lechers, the earth immortal and the porter, combined, don’t even compare to you!”

Chen Ping'an remained unfazed, replying slowly, “Island Master Liu, what you said earlier about the state of the mountains and rivers was quite impressive, like a deposed emperor who is ‘not guilty of his country’s crimes,’ replaying the chess game and guiding the state. It made me admire you. But now, you’re far from that, so please refrain from making such strange remarks in the future, alright?”

Liu Chongrun seemed a bit hurt, covering her collarbone with one hand and biting her lip.

Chen Ping'an remained unmoved, preparing to rise and take his leave.

Suddenly, Liu Chongrun called softly, “Chen Ping'an.”

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to sit back down, bewildered. “Hmm?”

In a swift motion, Liu Chongrun tore open her collar.

Chen Ping'an, a seasoned veteran who had faced countless life-and-death situations, reacted just as quickly, closing his eyes and standing up abruptly. “This is a one-time thing! Next time, the deal is off!”

Liu Chongrun laughed uncontrollably, watching the young man’s hurried retreat, unable to contain her glee. “Why don’t you tell that to Zhu Xianfu? Let’s see if he envies you!”

Chen Ping'an paused, facing away from her, and said softly, “Liu Chongrun, this isn’t appropriate.”

Liu Chongrun narrowed her eyes, snorting in disdain. “No sending off!”

As Chen Ping'an exited the mountain peak and headed towards the ferry to return to Qingxia Island, the old woman re-entered the courtyard, observing Liu Chongrun, who seemed a bit distracted. She asked, “Princess, do you really want to trust an outsider who has only shown up at Shujian Lake for less than half a year? Moreover, he’s so young. Even if he’s meticulous and steady, being young means a shallow foundation. This is an immutable truth. If not, that little brat you personally held onto the dragon throne would have endured so many years of pretending to be foolish and mad?”

Liu Chongrun regained her composure and replied nonchalantly, “Do you know what kind of people are most worth doing business with in this world?”

The old woman asked, “Please enlighten me, Princess.”

Liu Chongrun stood up, her tall figure exuding an imposing presence, her face steely as she gritted her teeth. “Those who are smart, good-hearted, and have boundaries—these three are essential. If that little brat hadn’t been misled and intentionally acted against me, his only skill was to oppose me. One by one, he killed all those in the court and the border armies. How could we have been obliterated?!”

The old woman refrained from commenting on these past events. Even though she had left the royal palace many years ago, she still adhered to the established principles of the palace, avoiding impudent speech or interference in politics.

The old woman maintained a stern expression and said, “Princess, to speak such words and act so towards a mere boy is truly shameless.”

Liu Chongrun surprisingly dashed over, bending down to gently link her arm with the old woman’s, playfully saying, “It was just for fun, just this once; there won’t be another chance.”

The old woman nodded. “Loneliness in a secluded chamber is the worry of women from the market. Now that you are a Golden Core earth immortal, you shouldn’t be as reckless as you were in your youth. Besides, an old cow eating tender grass is not appropriate.”

Liu Chongrun’s face turned bright red, as if sulking, and she released the old woman’s arm, retreating to Baoguang Pavilion, where no one could see her.

The old woman waited until Liu Chongrun had hidden away before breaking into a smile, though it vanished just as quickly.

The old woman understood that it wasn’t that the princess had genuine feelings for the young man or was in love at first sight. Rather, Liu Chongrun was under immense pressure and lacked a reliable support, which inevitably led her to act out of character. Over the past six months, how many precious porcelain items had been shattered in Baoguang Pavilion? When a glimmer of hope suddenly emerged, it could easily sway one’s heart, bringing extreme joy or sorrow, revealing their true nature—even for a Golden Core earth immortal.

Having watched the long princess grow up, the old woman remembered how mischievous and unruly she had been. The tutors in the palace had found it quite a challenge to discipline her.

The old woman had always been by Liu Chongrun’s side, supporting each other through thick and thin, until this point.

Now, with her Golden Core decaying and on the verge of collapse, it had become the final straw that nearly crushed the princess's spirit.

Watching a close one turn into a pile of bones was a pain every earth immortal cultivator must endure.

It was often not one’s parents or elders but rather a master, a companion, or a protector.

The closer the relationship, the greater the inner demons.

Just like Liu Lao Cheng, who had left the palace of Liu Island years ago.

He had to personally slay his beloved companion who had succumbed to madness.

Although the rumors' truth remains uncertain, this is the first taboo of Shujian Lake.

Yet the old woman believed it wholeheartedly.

Chen Ping'an returned to Qingxia Island as dusk fell.

Swallowing another elixir from the Water Palace stash, he picked up a purple bamboo brush, took a deep breath, and began to write the draft he had compiled from Zhu Chai Island.

The reason he had asked Liu Chongrun about the dynamics of their two countries was that this was the third thread he wanted to see unfold at Shujian Lake. The occurrences were the farthest from the present moment but could soon become relevant.

The first thread was Gu Can and the complex web surrounding him and his circle.

The second was the reunion of the father and daughter in Yun Lou City, which was relatively simple and clear.

The connections and sequences.

This was the most significant conclusion Chen Ping'an had drawn from his recent reflections on his journey to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land: when confronting myriad affairs and people, he would focus on the essence—setting aside all notions of good and evil for the time being, delving into why a person said this, did that, or harbored such thoughts.

Once he did that, even if everyone was as infatuated as that lovesick sword, they could still be utilized by him.

However, throughout this incredibly taxing and prolonged process, Chen Ping'an needed to think more than ever and proceed more slowly!

Pausing his pen, he picked up the sword-raising gourd nearby, took a sip of wine, and set it down.

His expression grew increasingly haggard, with sunken cheeks and a hint of stubble on his face. Yet, as he picked up the brush to write, his eyes shone with brilliance.

---

At the peak of one of the mightiest mountains in Central Land.

A disheveled old scholar was calculating with his fingers, his face wrinkled in anguish as he muttered, “This is not looking good.”

Not far away, a robust figure clad in golden armor loomed over the vast territory, “If the situation is dire and you can’t see the specifics, why not just slip away? No one would be surprised by your antics, and you’re thick-skinned enough to scold the juniors at the Wen Temple without a care.”

The old scholar rolled his eyes. “Shut up. Talking to you is like playing the lute to a cow.”

The golden-armored figure was unfazed.

Any cultivator beneath the Ascended realm who dared to tell this “supreme deity” of the Central Land’s countless gods to shut up would likely be met with a deadly strike.

As for the Ascended realm? A single sword could cleave through the territory of this mountain without difficulty.

The old scholar casually tossed a handful of stones to the ground, muttering, “Do you think that the stinking bull’s nose at the Dao Observation Temple gave away that Paulownia Leaf Umbrella for free? Did those three hundred years of time pass by just for my closed-door disciple to observe? It’s all a plot with malicious intent.”

The golden-armored figure sneered, “You’re just asking for trouble.”

The old scholar cursed under his breath, “What do you understand besides brute strength?”

The golden-armored figure responded, “Then you should leave Suishan. Didn’t the Sage send someone to invite you to the Wen Temple for a heart-to-heart?”

The old scholar shrugged, proudly declaring, “No way! I’m going to wait a bit longer. What can you do about it?”

The golden-armored figure glanced at the old scholar, hesitated, and asked, “That silver ingot sword pellet, did you already know the cause and effect behind it?”

The old scholar’s demeanor shifted, and he nodded. “Just a small matter.”

The golden-armored figure laughed, “You’re quite carefree.”

The old scholar retorted coldly, “If I’m not carefree, how could I tolerate so many pretentious scholars in this vast, righteous world?”

The golden-armored figure asked, “Since Qi Jingchun is no longer around, aren’t you afraid that the one who doesn’t acknowledge you as a teacher’s disciple might get lost?”

The old scholar suddenly stood up, striding over to the seated golden-armored figure. He pointed his finger at the latter’s helmet, poking him repeatedly as he scolded, “You can insult my knowledge and cultivation, but you cannot insult my judgment in selecting disciples!”

The golden-armored figure remained unfazed as he received the pokes on his helmet, calmly replying, “Go ahead, poke me again.”

The old scholar did just that, then jumped back, saying seriously, “You said it, not me.”

The golden-armored figure sighed deeply and turned away, pleading for the first time, “Please, I’m begging you. Just roll out of my Suishan already?”

The old scholar, filled with sudden rage, retorted, “Why should I need to hide in your place? Huh? I’ve already gone to kneel and bow to the old man, paying respects to the Sage! Did that help?”

The golden-armored figure turned back, “If you’re angry, don’t take it out on me.”

The old scholar rubbed his hands together and chuckled, “If I don’t use you as a punching bag, am I really going to bother the old man and the Sage? I’m not stupid.”

The golden-armored figure could no longer hold back and slowly stood up, revealing a massive sword in his hand. Unexpectedly, the old scholar had already fallen asleep on the ground. “Oh, come on, this path of divination is truly exhausting. I’m beat. If I start snoring, just bear with it.”

The golden-armored figure took a deep breath, sat back down in silence for a long while, and asked, “Are you really going to leave that Grand Scholar out there at the gates of Suishan, drinking the northwest wind?”

The old scholar, with his back turned to the mountain deity, was sound asleep, continuously calculating with his fingers. He didn’t forget to remind the towering figure, “I’m asleep now, so it’s understandable I won’t answer your questions.”

---

Above the vast sea of clouds.

It may be more expansive and boundless than any sky in the righteous world, even more so than the four corners of the earth.

A tall woman, holding an oil-paper umbrella made of Paulownia leaves in one hand and leaning on her sword with the other, stood on a golden bridge.

The long sword rested against the railing of the golden bridge, and from the sword’s tip, dazzling light radiated like the sun.

It was as if she was sharpening the sword’s edge.

She could walk out if she wanted to.

However, years ago, a dying man stood on this golden archway and spoke heartfelt words to her.

“The best whetstone in the world is not the Dragon Cutting Platform.”

“For virtuous people, it’s the darkest thoughts of the purest hearts. Conversely, the same applies, and they can forge the purest sword heart. The countless sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, with their fluctuating good and evil, still wield their sword qi like a rainbow—this is proof.”

“Before Chen Ping'an grows up, you can only draw your sword once at most. One time, and the measure is just right. Moreover, I hope that this time is as late as possible, preferably after the Golden Core and before the Jade Purity. After that, it will become void.”

“If there’s a second time, it won’t involve a Grand Scholar of the Academy or a Vice Master of the Wen Temple, nor an Ascendant who returns to the righteous world.”

That gray-haired scholar had pointed to the sky years ago. “The rules of the Sage are the most significant and stable. Once he appears…”

“Whether you’re scared or if it’s worth it, that’s another matter. So I implore you, senior, to consider it carefully, once more.”

After those words, there were more.

One particular phrase moved her the most.

“Initially, the senior chose Chen Ping'an, who bore no ill will or good will, as the new master, solely because Qi Jingchun persuaded you to gamble on a one in ten thousand chance. But didn’t you truly want to ascertain whether Chen Ping'an is worth entrusting all your hopes to? Even a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years later, you won’t be disappointed?!”

The following two sentences made her heart flutter, stirring her emotions.

“Back then, the senior likely didn’t think it through deeply. But you must understand that deep within Chen Ping'an’s heart, he hopes more than anyone to prove that he hasn’t let down Qi Jingchun, nor you.”

“Even if at that time, Chen Ping'an was already disappointed in himself.”

Thinking of this, the tall woman gently pressed her hand upon the long sword, causing the sword tip and a large section of the blade to pierce directly into the railing of the golden bridge.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 472: Another Year of Snow (Part 1)

As the sun set that day, the horizon was adorned with shimmering golden scales, resembling a massive golden carp gliding through the sky, its full form hidden from the eyes of mortals.

On Qingxia Island, the fishing house was managed by an elderly Dragon Gate realm cultivator, who personally escorted a timid young man off the boat and onto the shore, making their way towards the mountain gate.

The fishing house on Qingxia Island was home to Qi practitioners, similar to the Zhan Gan Lang of the Great Li Dynasty. The old cultivator was named Zhang Ye, a peculiar name laced with the scent of cosmetics, yet he was a trusted confidant of the True Lord Jie Jiang, Liu Zhimiao. Zhang Ye had been among the earliest followers of Liu Zhimiao when he was still just a wild cultivator at the Sea Observation realm. At that time, Zhang Ye was a genuine disciple of the Puzhen Immortal Sect and had already achieved the Sea Observation realm himself. The tales of those days could fuel several drinking sessions among the older generation on Qingxia Island.

The young man's name was Zeng Ye, a promising talent recently discovered on Maoyue Island, naturally suited for ghost path cultivation. Despite his good aptitude, being skilled in the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake did not guarantee a bright future. Without the intervention of the Qingxia Island fishing house, Zeng Ye would have been used by the island master to nurture spirit insects and cultivate ghost fetuses. His early ascension to a higher realm would have made him seem like a prodigy cultivated with great effort by Maoyue Island. In reality, the day Zeng Ye reached the Middle Five realm, he would face soul-slicing and spirit extraction, at which point he would learn the meaning of fleeting fortunes.

Zhang Ye was a taciturn cultivator, not one to engage in idle chatter. Even with Liu Zhimiao, he spoke little, but given the gravity of the situation, he felt compelled to remind Zeng Ye again: “Zeng Ye, our patron, Mr. Chen, is a formidable figure whose deeds you might have heard of. He currently resides near the mountain gate. When you meet Mr. Chen, there’s no need to force flattery on my behalf or that of Qingxia Island; just speak the truth. In Maoyue Island, you have already heard your master and ancestor confide in me their plans, so ultimately, your life was saved by Mr. Chen. Furthermore, I know what you are worried about — whether you’ve jumped from the dragon’s den into the tiger’s lair. To be frank, Mr. Chen will not harm you. On Maoyue Island, you would meet a pitiful end, but here on Qingxia Island, you will find genuine cultivation opportunities. Honestly, I even envy you; in the immortal’s cave, even those senior disciples of the Puzhen Immortal Sect would not enjoy such luck.”

Zeng Ye was naturally weak-willed. Having been frightened out of his wits on Maoyue Island and deeply hurt by his master, he still felt somewhat disoriented, nodding repeatedly, thinking that even if things went wrong, they couldn’t be worse than on Maoyue Island.

Zhang Ye paused for a moment and continued slowly, “But after you rise to prominence, do not forget your roots. After all, it was Qingxia Island that pulled you from the depths of despair. No matter where you enjoy your fortunes alongside Mr. Chen in the future, remember the life-saving grace of Qingxia Island. What do you think, Zeng Ye?”

Zeng Ye swallowed hard, “I understand. I will never forget your great kindness, sir.”

Zhang Ye smiled, “I only need to hear you say that once. Keep it in your heart; don’t keep repeating it. Words can become like a barrel of wine—today a sip, tomorrow a swallow, and soon it’ll be empty, losing its significance.”

Zeng Ye was an orphan brought back to Maoyue Island by his master from the market of Shihou Kingdom. His master was short-sighted, having only glimpsed a hint of his potential. It was the Dragon Gate realm ancestor of Maoyue Island who had truly recognized Zeng Ye’s rare roots and intended to drain his essence using sinister ghost path secrets to nurture a couple of Middle Five realm spirits. The ancestor had previously confided to Zeng Ye that had he had the backing of Qingxia Island, he wouldn’t have to resort to such desperate measures. Had he been given that support, Zeng Ye might have grown into Maoyue Island's first Golden Core Earth Immortal. In truth, there simply weren’t enough immortal resources to squander.

Zeng Ye felt a chill run down his spine at these thoughts.

After discussing everything necessary, Zhang Ye led Zeng Ye to the door and gently knocked. “Mr. Chen, the suitable candidate is here.”

A wave of intense fear surged through Zeng Ye, engulfing him like a tide, and his legs turned to jelly.

Just as that old immortal had said, how could he not be afraid of jumping from one pit of fire into another pot of oil?

And then, for the first time in his life, young Zeng Ye met the man named Chen Ping'an.

The door opened.

Although Zeng Ye was only fourteen, he was tall for his age, and he didn't need to look up to see the man's face clearly.

The man wore a thick blue cotton robe with a white jade hairpin perched atop his head. He was tall and slender, with a gaunt face.

He was neither an old immortal like Zhang Ye nor a wealthy young master like Lu Caishang or Yuan Yuan.

Then the man smiled and said, “Hello, I’m Chen Ping'an. What’s your name?”

Zeng Ye wanted to speak, but his body was tense, his limbs stiff, and his lips moved, yet not a sound escaped.

Zhang Ye, somewhat helpless, had to answer for the dazed young man. “Mr. Chen, this is Zeng Ye, from Maoyue Island. He’s a pitiful child I pulled out, meeting your requirements. His natural aptitude is suited for ghost path cultivation, making him a prime candidate for possession by dark entities and spirits. Traveling together in the human realm not only won’t deplete his essence, but it will also foster his cultivation.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, then smiled at Zeng Ye. “I have a method to test your vitality. Just stand still, and I’ll see how heavy your spirit is.”

Zeng Ye stood frozen, unresponsive.

Chen Ping'an didn’t make a move.

Zhang Ye gently patted Zeng Ye, laughing, “You can’t even nod now?”

With that pat on his shoulder, Zeng Ye finally snapped out of his daze and nodded vigorously.

Chen Ping'an grasped the young man's shoulder and lifted him gently. Zeng Ye’s toes barely brushed the ground but did not leave it.

After releasing him, Chen Ping'an nodded. “Not particularly heavy. In the future, I’ll pay attention to signs of your spirit. If anything seems off, I won’t let you force yourself.”

Zeng Ye remained silent, not daring to speak or knowing what to say.

It felt as if he had lost his soul again.

After all, on that ominous Maoyue Island, before being recognized for his roots, he had been bullied by the inner disciples. Now, standing before a high-ranking old immortal like Zhang Ye, let alone a seemingly even more formidable young immortal, just managing not to be supported was already Zeng Ye's greatest effort.

Zhang Ye sighed, “Mr. Chen, isn’t this boy’s temperament a bit too weak? Shall I look around the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake for others?”

Chen Ping'an had been observing Zeng Ye’s expressions and eyes, shaking his head with a smile. “It’s fine; I think he’s quite good.”

Zhang Ye felt relieved, satisfied with the exchange.

On Maoyue Island, they dared not ask for too much but would not simply give away anything either. This was an unwritten rule of the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake: either Qingxia Island would forcibly take someone, swallowing Maoyue Island whole, or they would negotiate fairly. So after Zhang Ye quoted a reasonable price, he didn’t haggle and paid the agreed amount of immortal money.

Chen Ping'an wasn’t unfamiliar with this, asking, “What price did Maoyue Island offer?”

Zhang Ye hesitated for a moment before slowly replying, “According to the ancestor of Maoyue Island, conservatively speaking, one Zeng Ye could eventually nurture a ghost fetus and a spirit, which would be equivalent to two cave-dwelling realm cultivators in twenty years. After deducting the costs to cultivate Zeng Ye to the Middle Five realm, Maoyue Island quoted ten Gu Yu coins.”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, “Here, we’ll need to add the costs of Zhang Laoxian and all the manpower from Qingxia Island’s fishing house, so let’s consider it fifteen Gu Yu coins. We’ll put it on Qingxia Island’s tab for now, and I’ll pay all other expenses later.”

Zhang Ye nodded, “No problem.”

Whether it was his own troublemaker Gu Can or the young masters of Drum Sound Island, Lu Caishang and Huang Li Island’s Yuan Yuan, the current batch of top-notch youth was completely different from the older generation of wild cultivators in the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake. Everyone took pleasure in breaking the old rules, using this as a foundation to gather goodwill.

Zhang Ye dared not say they were wrong; after all, he would smile at any of these young ones he met. Yet, deep down, he was uncomfortable.

It seemed that these young people, who disregarded all rules, were faring better, leaving Zhang Ye, an old man from the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake, feeling a bit helpless.

Thus, Chen Ping'an's actions left Zhang Ye with a hint of goodwill.

Otherwise, with the reputation this person had built in the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake, he wouldn’t have had to pay a single snowflake coin, yet Zhang Ye and Qingxia Island would have had to swallow their pride.

But this bit of goodwill wasn’t particularly useful.

As Zhang Ye pondered these thoughts, he felt increasingly troubled, sensing that something was off, yet unable to pinpoint what it was.

Such was the state of the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake.

He was a Dragon Gate realm cultivator with no hope of reaching the Golden Core realm. Liu Zhimiao had privately done all he could do, having shown kindness and duty. In the vibrant and optimistic Book of Simple Knowledge Lake, Zhang Ye was akin to an elderly market dweller nearing the end of his life. Moreover, compared to that, a Qi practitioner had a sharper perception of their own decaying body and fading spirit. That sense of dying slowly, buried inch by inch in the earth, was more acute for him. If it weren’t for Zhang Ye’s relatively open-minded nature, he might have taken some drastic measures by now. After all, in the lawless Book of Simple Knowledge Lake, there were plenty of outlets for venting frustrations.

Young Zeng Ye settled into Qingxia Island.

In the room next door to Chen Ping'an.

When the boy from Maoyue Island closed the door and sat on the edge of the bed, it felt as if he had traveled to another world.

After a restless night, he dozed off and didn’t wake up until the sun was high the next day. Upon opening his eyes and looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, he felt utterly lost. It took him a moment to remember that he was no longer a cultivator of Maoyue Island. He encouraged himself, and just as he stepped out of the room, he spotted a fellow dressed in a dark blue python robe sitting by the door, munching on sunflower seeds and glancing at him.

Zeng Ye nearly turned and ran back into his room, diving under the covers.

Gu Can asked, “You’re Zeng Ye? The one who came from Maoyue Island?”

Sweat had already beaded on Zeng Ye’s forehead.

This little troublemaker had stirred up stormy waves in the Book of Simple Knowledge Lake. Although Zeng Ye had never seen Gu Can in person, he had seen his likeness in the reports from Willow Catkin Island. The descriptions of Gu Can in those reports, along with the way the cultivators from Maoyue Island spoke of him, were still fresh in Zeng Ye’s memory. He had originally thought he would never encounter Gu Can in his life. He certainly didn’t wish to see him, as that would likely mean Gu Can was trampling Maoyue Island with a giant mud eel.

Gu Can said irritably, “So you’re just a fool.”

Zeng Ye didn’t dare retort.

If Gu Can didn’t slap his head off, Zeng Ye felt like he might kneel down in gratitude.

The almost suffocating tension in the air suddenly dissipated.

It was then that the man in the blue cotton robe stepped to the door.

He said to Gu Can, “You’re weak right now, in a state of decline. More vulnerable to the chill of dark energy than ordinary folk. You should hurry back to the Spring Pavilion to recuperate.”

Gu Can nodded, glancing at the small pile of sunflower seeds in his hand, and handed them to Chen Ping'an. “I’m off then.”

Chen Ping'an accepted the seeds, cracked one open, and said, “When the charcoal and snow allow you to return to the shore, have her come find me. I have something for her.”

Gu Can smiled brightly. “Got it!”

After Gu Can left, Chen Ping'an offered Zeng Ye the sunflower seeds in his hand, but Zeng Ye quickly shook his head.

Chen Ping'an turned and went into the room to fetch a chair, sitting down on the bamboo stool Gu Can had used.

Zeng Ye sat on the edge of the chair nervously, unsure where to place his hands and feet.

Chen Ping'an cracked seeds, smiling as he said, “You might need to stay by my side for two or three years at the least, perhaps even seven or eight. You can call me Mr. Chen. It’s not that my name is too precious to be called, but rather it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to do so. Everyone in Qingxia Island is watching this side. Just keep acting as you are now, observe more and say less. For tasks, aside from what I assign you, don’t worry about doing too much for now. You don’t have to understand everything right away.”

Zeng Ye nodded silently.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “Are you afraid of ghosts?”

Zeng Ye hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.

Chen Ping'an said, “Zeng Ye, let me tell you something: here, you don’t need to worry about saying the wrong thing. Just speak your mind.”

Finally, Zeng Ye replied, “I’m not afraid of ghosts. Ever since I was little, I’ve been able to see dirty things. After following my master to Maoyue Island, many of my seniors have ghosts they raise.”

Chen Ping'an casually asked, “Do you hate your master?”

Zeng Ye pressed his lips together, falling silent again. The simple-minded boy’s face bore sadness mixed with a hint of stubbornness.

Chen Ping'an nodded. “So there’s some hate there, but more sadness, right? And upon reflection, it seems your master isn’t a bad person. If it weren’t for him, you might have died long ago. So, whether it’s towards your master or Maoyue Island, you’d still want to think of them as family.”

Zeng Ye lowered his head, murmuring, “I know I’m foolish. I’m sorry, Mr. Chen. I might not be of much help to you in the future. I might make mistakes often, and if you hit or scold me, I’ll accept it.”

Chen Ping'an cracked seeds, gazing into the distance, softly saying, “Is that foolish? I don’t think so.”

Zeng Ye was too immersed in his sorrow to catch the underlying meaning. He only remembered he was seated next to a patron of Qingxia Island and should listen closely to every word of wisdom. This made him feel even more like a failure, deserving his suffering.

Chen Ping'an said, “But I’m not criticizing you, Zeng Ye. Your courage is indeed a bit lacking. When I was your age, I was already handling things on my own. Meeting so-called prominent figures never made me feel small or intimidated.”

After finishing the sunflower seeds, Chen Ping'an rubbed his chin in thought, self-deprecatingly saying, “Maybe I should take a trip to Purple Bamboo Island and ask for a bamboo pole to make myself a bamboo sword. Coupled with that imitation of the yellow canal I bought from the Weeping Monkey Street, I can learn from my own foundation disciple. Mixing swords and knives to scare people still works.”

Zeng Ye, a bit slow on the uptake, finally said, “I can’t compare to Mr. Chen.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, standing up. “Can you read? If you can recognize characters, I’ll teach you two secret techniques. They aren’t too advanced, but practicing them properly won’t be worse than what you learned on Maoyue Island.”

Zeng Ye hurried to his feet. “I can read, though my master always scolded me for being slow.”

Chen Ping'an picked up the chair, saying, “No worries. If you encounter something you don’t understand, just ask me.”

As Chen Ping'an stepped over the threshold, he turned to see Zeng Ye carefully following behind, hands empty.

Chen Ping'an sighed. “Your master scolded you for being slow, and I see he didn’t wrong you. You could at least carry the chair.”

Zeng Ye suddenly realized, turning back to grab the bamboo chair.

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly.

Finally, he had a normal child by his side.

That felt good.

As he thought this, the accountant didn’t even realize he was only three years older than young Zeng Ye.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 473: Another Year of Snow (Part 2)

In the following days, Zeng Ye hardly left Mr. Chen’s side, except to sleep in the neighboring room. He repeatedly pored over the few pages of paper, which were neatly filled with tiny, precise characters. As a practitioner who had entered the lower fifth realm, Zeng Ye could certainly recognize the words. However, the secret art of ghostly techniques that Mr. Chen referred to as “not of high rank” seemed to refuse to acknowledge him.

Almost every two or three sentences he read, Zeng Ye encountered a stumbling block, sparking another question. Initially, he tried to tough it out and read through the entire technique before asking for clarification, but the more he read, the more his head throbbed, to the point where he began to sweat profusely, teetering on the brink of losing his composure. Alarmed, Zeng Ye recalled some teachings regarding the cultivation of immortal arts that he had heard before: the higher the technique, the more cautious one must be in immersing oneself in it. If one became too absorbed and could not extricate themselves, and lacked a guiding protector, it could lead to significant harm to their foundational path.

Mr. Chen had been sitting beside him without explicitly urging Zeng Ye, but once Zeng Ye dropped the heavy sheets of paper and gasped for air, Mr. Chen nodded quietly to himself. A lack of talent was not the worst flaw; a shallow temperament was the greatest barrier to Zeng Ye mastering this ghostly technique.

If Zeng Ye lacked even this small measure of resolve, following Mr. Chen on this path would only lead him deeper into madness.

Mr. Chen would not force Zeng Ye away, but he also would not allow him to continue his cultivation blindly. He treated Zeng Ye as simply an additional neighbor, akin to the old cultivator guarding the mountain gate.

Mr. Chen would rather lose fifteen pieces of Gu Yu coins than let Zhang Ye and the fishing house on Qingxia Island find unsuitable candidates.

After experiencing the difficulty, Zeng Ye ceased to pretend to be more capable than he was and began to ask Mr. Chen questions whenever he felt uncertain.

Mr. Chen patiently clarified each of Zeng Ye’s doubts.

First, there were detailed annotations by Wei Ban, and second, Mr. Chen had engaged in several discussions with renowned practitioners like Ma Yuan Zhi from the Zhu Xian Mansion, Yu Kuai, and the grand practitioners of the Yin-Yang sect, allowing him to glean some insights himself.

As for why he didn’t simply provide Zeng Ye with a “commentary version” of the technique or spill all the intricacies and precautions in one go, that stemmed from the broader aim of guiding the young man’s path of enlightenment.

Meeting was fate; Mr. Chen hoped that Zeng Ye would genuinely benefit from this exchange, finding a solid foundation for his future journey into the middle fifth realm and beyond.

Giving someone a fish was less valuable than teaching them to fish.

Years ago, Ah Liang had treated him this way, and Mr. Chen wished to extend the same courtesy to a fourteen-year-old boy from Shujian Lake. Zeng Ye was still a simple-minded youth, untouched by the corrupting influences of the world.

The secret technique from Wei Ban was undoubtedly not of low rank.

Mr. Chen handed over the technique, and as Zeng Ye caught it, it became evident that whether or not he could grasp it was not simply about learning.

How had Zeng Ye learned? What depths of effort and willpower had he poured into this? If he were to acquire such a substantial fortune so easily, how could he truly cherish it? How would he reflect on his initial intent throughout his lengthy cultivation journey, reminding himself of how hard-earned it was?

Regardless of how other sects and immortal families taught disciples the ways of enlightenment, in Mr. Chen's view, learning could be slow but must be steady.

Yet, Mr. Chen soon found himself with a headache.

Because Zeng Ye… was simply too dull-witted!

Mr. Chen had always thought himself to be of mediocre talent. After all, it was Ning Yao who had taught him to read the "Mountain-shaking Fist Manual," and during his travels through the Great Sui, he had Li Baoping, a young girl in a red cotton jacket, by his side, making connections and learning from everything around him. As for martial arts, he had Lin Shouyi to guide him, and when it came to fighting, it was the "invincible" elder from the Cui family who had taught him the ropes. He even encountered his peer, Cao Ci, at the Sword Qi Great Wall, a prodigy who had defeated him three times in a row. Following that, he had Pei Qian, who practiced the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops like a game, and she was even his first disciple. As for charisma and flair, he had the likes of Lu Tai and Liu Qingshan to look up to...

Even after introspecting and realizing he should no longer belittle himself following his experiences in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he still bore some residual effects of his past mindset.

Yet, when faced with the stubborn Zeng Ye, Mr. Chen could not help but feel he was a genius in comparison… He nearly wanted to exclaim, no wonder the great Sword Immortal had once revealed a secret, saying that had he not shattered his life’s porcelain and broken the Bridge of Eternal Life, he would have possessed “Earth Immortal qualifications.”

Because Zeng Ye was simply too dull.

What should have been a simple mantra took Mr. Chen half a day to explain, and all Zeng Ye managed to grasp was a vague understanding.

Years ago, when Ning Yao taught the essence of the Mountain-shaking Fist at the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Lane, Mr. Chen thought he had understood well enough. However, when it came to executing the Six Steps Stance, he stumbled and embarrassed himself a bit. Yet, he quickly gained some insights. It was only later that he realized he had been blissfully unaware of the “fist intent” that a pure martial artist pursues, which had already begun to flow through him. Although his fist intent had not yet fully matured, having moved from nonexistence to existence was a significant first step in martial arts, akin to a qi practitioner taking a leap forward, a feat not easily accomplished.

Thankfully, Mr. Chen was not impatient. If Zeng Ye learned slowly, then he would teach even more slowly and with greater detail.

Three pages of paper meant Zeng Ye could only manage one page a day, and it was still quite a struggle.

Consequently, the young man felt guilty every day, believing he was letting Mr. Chen down.

Mr. Chen said nothing to comfort the boy, offering no empty flattery about Zeng Ye’s talent.

The complexities of the world are often at odds with the sincerity of one’s heart.

These two contradictory forces would inevitably clash, and more often than not, it was the latter that bore the brunt of the consequences.

The more trials and tribulations Zeng Ye faced today, the stronger his foundation would become, helping him avoid losing ground when he encountered truly significant challenges in the future.

Residing on Qingxia Island in Shujian Lake, Mr. Chen now had ample time to reflect on the past, inadvertently chewing on many flavors he had previously not had the time to contemplate. For instance, the barefoot old man on the second floor of the bamboo building in the Fallen Mountain, who once said that the so-called pure martial artist was not solely defined by their techniques. Even if one learned countless styles, it did not detract from their purity. The true essence of purity lay in one's fist intent and their temperament. It was simple: when Chen Ping’an first practiced martial arts, against the ants of the second and third realms, he knew deep down that he would undoubtedly lose when facing practitioners of the fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, and even tenth realms. However, once trapped in a life-and-death situation, would he still dare to throw out a punch? Could he maintain his fist intent without faltering? Instead, would it not become even more pure and relentless?

When facing strong opponents, one must first establish themselves in an unassailable position to have a chance of winning, even if it is a one-in-ten-thousand opportunity.

A wavering fist intent meant there was no chance at all! What good was it to practice any martial art if you accepted defeat so easily?

Three days later, Zeng Ye had barely grasped the secret technique and began his official cultivation.

Mr. Chen then reminded Zeng Ye not to be overly eager for speed; as long as he was slow and error-free, Mr. Chen could wait. Otherwise, to correct mistakes after they occurred would truly waste time and deplete precious resources. To help Zeng Ye feel this more profoundly, Mr. Chen had a straightforward method: if Zeng Ye rushed his cultivation, making a mistake that harmed his spirit, he would have to rely on expensive elixirs to recuperate. Mr. Chen would buy the medicine, but every single piece, even if it cost only one snowflake coin, would be recorded in Zeng Ye’s debt ledger.

For the first time, Mr. Chen displayed a serious demeanor, standing at the door of Zeng Ye's room, which was about to close for seclusion, and stated, “Our relationship is a transactional one. I will do my utmost to ensure mutual benefit, hoping that one day we can part on good terms. But don’t forget, I am not your master, nor your protector. You must always keep this in mind.”

Zeng Ye felt a twinge of fear at Mr. Chen's serious expression and quickly nodded.

If it weren't for this, after three days of close interaction, where Mr. Chen had been nothing but kind and approachable, the boy might have nearly forgotten their first meeting, almost losing sight of his earlier embarrassment and trepidation.

On the other hand, Zeng Ye vividly remembered Gu Can, whom he had only met once. One night, he even had a nightmare about a little devil clad in a dark blue robe, who ripped open his chest and devoured his heart. With a gleeful smile, Gu Can remarked, “Delicious!” Zeng Ye stared down at the gaping, bloody hole in his chest and... woke up, sitting on his bed, terrified and unable to calm himself for a long time.

While Zeng Ye officially began to cultivate the secret art, Mr. Chen visited Yuegou Island and Yuhu Island, spending money with Yu Kuai and the Yin-Yang sect practitioner to place the remaining souls or ghostly entities into a ghostly treasure known as the “Hall of Yama,” a compact loft made of dark wood, standing at a height of an arm. Inside, it was designed to house three hundred sixty-five minuscule chambers, perfectly suited for nurturing and containing spirits.

Mr. Chen's earlier intervention during the confrontation with Liu Lao Cheng had not gone unnoticed by Yu Kuai and the Yin-Yang sect practitioners, leading to a two-tenths reduction in the overall price.

Of course, both old foxes, serving under the command of the True Monarch of the River, would not openly admit that they were reluctant to charge Mr. Chen more due to his combat prowess. It was difficult to raise prices and extract more silver from buyers, but it was easy for sellers to find a reason to lower prices and offer discounts. Mr. Chen naturally would not expose this and thanked the two practitioners. Over time, this engendered a bit of a trivial connection.

During Mr. Chen's visits to the two islands for trade, he carried the long-forgotten bamboo box on his back, meant for holding the “true fate” treasure, the Hall of Yama, which ghostly cultivators yearned for.

Both Yu Kuai and the Yin-Yang sect practitioner noted this but did not display any odd behavior, deliberately ignoring it.

To them, Mr. Chen’s resilience and vitality after his fierce battle with Liu Lao Cheng was already something even Nascent Soul experts would admire. The inability to refine the Hall of Yama merely suggested Mr. Chen’s current plight was precarious, particularly due to instability in his aura, preventing him from storing this ghostly treasure. It wasn't surprising.

The art of refining spiritual items and treasures is not overly complex; the key lies in the quality of the items. Generally, a practitioner of the Earth Immortal realm could not even handle semi-immortal weapons, let alone engage in refinement. The influence of the Fu family in the Old Dragon City partly stemmed from their Earth Immortal prowess, allowing them to control a semi-immortal weapon completely.

Thus, not only Yu Kuai and the Yin-Yang sect practitioner, but all the cultivators on Qingxia Island, including Liu Zhimiao, found it most perplexing that Mr. Chen could wield what was very likely a semi-immortal weapon!

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 474: Another Year of Snow (Part Two)

The young accountant wielded an unknown celestial sword, capable of trading blows with martial practitioners, and possessed two of his own life swords...

These unreasonable traits were precisely what Chen Ping'an could leverage at Book Letter Lake for negotiation.

However, for the average wild cultivator or rogue immortal at Book Letter Lake, once they acquired such unreasonable advantages, they would likely become even more unreasonable. Strength and skill were merely tools to bypass reason; what other purpose could there be? Why would they bother with kindness? Such a philosophy was ingrained in the culture of Book Letter Lake, where generations of practitioners across thousands of islands had long accepted this norm. Perhaps only the highest-ranked cultivator, Liu Laocheng, was the sole exception amid the local crowd.

Unfortunately, Liu Laocheng was currently avoiding all encounters with practitioners from Book Letter Lake. The only one who had managed to set foot on Gongliu Island was the master of Rice Grain Island, who was in fact a major spy for the Song clan of the Great Li Dynasty. Without that identity, he would have had no means to access the island.

Chen Ping'an returned to Qingxia Island and made another visit to the Zhu Xian Mansion.

On Pearl Hairpin Island, he had learned about the convoluted secrets of the two countries from Liu Chongrun. Now, as he gazed at the prominently displayed signboard of Zhu Xian Mansion, a wave of emotion washed over him.

Rubbing his chin, he pondered whether it was time to shave. Should he really follow Xu Yuanxia's example and flaunt a bushy beard?

At the entrance to the mansion, the ghost cultivator Ma Yuanzhi appeared, cursing and demanding that Chen Ping'an scram.

Chen Ping'an ignored him; they hadn't even discussed the matter at hand yet.

After venting his frustrations, Ma Yuanzhi asked, “The report from Liuxu Island says your latest visit to Pearl Hairpin Island was under the heavy protection of those beautiful guards, where you met Liu Chongrun?! The report even asserts that Liu Chongrun has likely taken a liking to you, and who knows, you might soon be appointed as a patron for Pearl Hairpin Island!”

Chen Ping'an rolled his eyes.

Ma Yuanzhi looked at him in disbelief, “Really nothing happened?”

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Ma Yuanzhi’s expression brightened, “Ah, Mr. Chen, such a noble and principled person as yourself, of course, wouldn’t compete with me over Liu Chongrun. I apologize for my rudeness! Come, come, let’s sit in the mansion. As long as you assure me that you will have absolutely no dealings with Liu Chongrun in this lifetime—especially no romantic entanglements—then we can settle that previous deal at half price!”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I have no inappropriate thoughts towards the island master. But what if she becomes overly persistent with me?”

Ma Yuanzhi burst into laughter, “I didn’t know you could joke, Mr. Chen! The Crown Princess, liking you? That’s impossible! She’s not easily bewitched.”

Then Ma Yuanzhi spoke softly, “But if that day truly comes, and the Crown Princess loses her senses, I ask you to remain composed! Show a bit of the refined demeanor expected of a gentleman! One should never take advantage of a friend’s wife.”

Walking through Zhu Xian Mansion with Ma Yuanzhi, Chen Ping'an felt a chill run down his spine, nearly breaking his resolve to reveal Liu Chongrun’s true opinions about Ma Yuanzhi. He barely managed to keep his mouth shut, sighing at the tangled stories of this freeloader and Liu Chongrun.

The thought of having to visit Pearl Hairpin Island again made Chen Ping'an's head throb.

He could only assure Ma Yuanzhi that he would not provoke Liu Chongrun and had no designs on her.

Satisfied, Ma Yuanzhi glanced at Chen Ping'an as they entered the main hall and said, “If this were back when you first arrived at Qingxia Island, I might have had my doubts. But now? You look no better than me! I can rest easy!”

Chen Ping'an took off his bamboo box from his back and took out the artifact, the Hall of Yama, saying helplessly, “Then I thank you for your trust.”

The two then began their transaction.

Ma Yuanzhi was in awe of the Hall of Yama, which bore the inscription “Descend to Hell” on its base. He stared hungrily at the exquisite wooden pavilion, openly admitting, “After years of struggle on Qingxia Island, I’ve always dreamed of earning this reward from a true king. If that fails, I’d even sell my house to buy one. You see, the Hall of Yama is the most essential treasure for us ghost cultivators. Without one, no ghostly celestial would dare show their face among their peers. However, there are different grades of the Hall; this one is the most basic, yet still a rather respectable artifact. I’ve heard that the highest-ranked ghost cultivator in our Baping continent possesses a ‘Great Prison’ grade Hall, as large as a real skyscraper, with three thousand six hundred chambers. When the cultivators send their Yin spirits to wander inside, they can enjoy the eerie winds and ghostly wails, benefiting their cultivation.”

Chen Ping'an remarked, “One day, if I leave Book Letter Lake, I might sell it to you.”

Ma Yuanzhi turned to Chen Ping'an with a grin, “I’ve been waiting for you to say that! It’s a deal!”

After handing over the celestial coins, Ma Yuanzhi led Chen Ping'an to a well at the bottom of Zhu Xian Mansion, instructing him to place the pavilion on the ground.

Ma Yuanzhi took out a soul summoning banner, stepped into a stance, chanted incantations, and channeled spiritual energy. Wisps of green smoke floated out from the banner, transforming into ghostly figures upon touching the ground. From the well, pale arms began to claw their way out, clearly struggling against the stronger forces that bound them. Even after escaping the well, they appeared dazed and had difficulty standing. Ma Yuanzhi paid them no mind, commanding the spirits to crawl or walk as they pleased, gradually reducing in size until they entered the Hall of Yama.

Standing to the side, Chen Ping'an observed this scene. He had seen similar sights twice already with Yu Huai and the practitioners of the Yin-Yang School.

It looked like a sorrowful downpour, but in reality, it was the harsh glare of the sun.

Before leaving Zhu Xian Mansion, the ghost cultivator did not see him off. Instead, he stood by the well and suddenly said to Chen Ping'an in a low voice, “Why do you bother? Wasting your energy and effort for little gain.”

Chen Ping'an replied softly, “Defeat is certain. I’m just seeking peace of mind.”

Ma Yuanzhi scoffed, “Just for peace of mind? Isn’t that an excessive amount of celestial coins to pull out?”

Chen Ping'an countered, “The one who brings you peace of mind is Liu Chongrun. For her, you risked going to the borders of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, even putting your life on the line. I haven’t seen you show any signs of remorse or regret.”

Ma Yuanzhi was taken aback, at a loss for words.

He suddenly chuckled, “It’s different for me. I do this hoping to win over the Crown Princess, yearning to become her partner. Even just a few moments of intimacy would be worth it. After all, the Crown Princess is the greatest aspiration of a lowly freeloader like me. What will you gain?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “We walk different paths; there's no need to say more.”

Ma Yuanzhi sighed, “We’re both unfortunate brothers, suffering from our lack of appeal to women. It’s a pity! You should visit Zhu Xian Mansion more often. Seeing you brightens my mood.”

Now it was Chen Ping'an's turn to be speechless.

With the bamboo box on his back, he left the Zhu Xian Mansion, where the owner’s gaze was somewhat unfriendly.

He didn’t consider himself handsome; in fact, he looked rather disheveled. But how could he possibly have fallen to the same plight as Ma Yuanzhi?

Chen Ping'an promised himself.

His parents wouldn’t approve either.

As he stepped out of the mansion, he smiled.

Hong Su was no longer at Zhu Xian Mansion; she had been arranged by Liu Zhimiao to serve as a maid at his Hengbo Mansion. It was said she also held a position as a female officer, supervising a dozen or so maidservants.

Ma Yuanzhi may have found the situation baffling, but he certainly wouldn’t dare refuse any small tasks assigned by the island master’s confidant.

Chen Ping'an had made a special trip to see Hong Su during his first visit to Hengbo Mansion. At that time, she hadn’t seemed very enthusiastic. Chen Ping'an knew it was likely because, as an outsider from Zhu Xian Mansion, she suddenly found herself promoted to the central government in the capital, especially to a small official position, which would naturally lead to severe ostracism from her colleagues and subordinates.

However, upon seeing Chen Ping'an, Hong Su was genuinely happy.

Chen Ping'an politely declined the head steward's goodwill and simply let Hong Su show him around Hengbo Mansion before taking his leave.

Afterward, there was a day when Hong Su asked the steward for an hour off, escaping the strict and formal atmosphere of Hengbo Mansion to seek out Mr. Chen at the mountain gate. She found the door tightly shut and even went to the ferry, but ultimately, she was unable to catch a glimpse of that thin figure.

With some disappointment, she returned to Hengbo Mansion, intending to save up her gratitude and appreciation for later.

Little did she know, Chen Ping'an had been sitting behind his desk the entire time.

Just as when he was a child brewing medicine, aside from the quality of the ingredients, the most critical aspect was timing.

Too much or too little could spoil everything.

Chen Ping'an certainly acknowledged Hong Su’s gratitude.

However, he could not overlook his own status and the circumstances surrounding Hong Su.

When Liu Zhimiao visited that day and intentionally mentioned the girl crafted by Gu Can, Chen Ping'an perceived it as a rather lowly act, so he used the excuse of hearing that the true king was skilled in brewing tea to remind Liu Zhimiao not to entertain such thoughts any further.

Liu Zhimiao immediately caught on, no longer subtly fanning the flames between Chen Ping'an and Gu Can.

In Book Letter Lake, having a friend who treated him sincerely was an extra burden on his mind, and he understood the price he would have to pay for it in the future.

Chen Ping'an was aware.

But he also understood that having a friend like Hong Su on Qingxia Island was incredibly important for his state of mind.

Like water reflecting the bright moon in a ditch, the gentle flow of water may not help a parched heart, but the difference between having that clear, shallow ditch and not having it at all was immense.

In those years, Chen Ping'an had done many small things to repay Gu Can’s kindness, including sneaking out at night to fetch water during a drought. Even if he couldn’t steal water from the strong young men who patrolled at night, it was enough that the ditch still flowed.

There remained hope.

Others would eventually tire and return to sleep; at those times, Chen Ping'an, hidden in the shadows, could dash out to dig up the small dam of mud blocking the water source upstream, listening to the rush of flowing water, joyfully running down the furrows until he reached Gu Can's fields, crouching down to build a small dam, allowing the water to flow into the fields, watching the water level rise little by little, and once it was full, he would remove the small dam, letting the water flow away.

During those years, Gu Can’s family had hardly ever worried about fetching water, never quarreled with fellow villagers or farmers.

Chen Ping'an never considered what he did as repaying kindness.

It was simply what he ought to do.

In a tumultuous world, when things could not be set right, first set your own heart at peace, and life could go on without feeling overly bitter.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 475: The Coldest Time is When the Snow Melts

On this day, Zeng Ye stumbled as he pushed open the door, his face smeared with blood.

Chen Ping'an was already standing outside, helping him walk back to the table. He took out a bottle of pills—of modest quality, these were common elixirs from the secret vault of Qingxia Island, worth a small sum of money. They were typically purchased in bulk by practitioners of the Cave Dwelling and Sea Viewing realms. For someone like Zeng Ye, who was merely a third-tier Qi practitioner, they were more than sufficient. Higher-grade pills, with an excess of spiritual energy (Qi), were unsuitable for lower-tier practitioners, who lacked the ability to refine and transform them into Qi reserves.

After swallowing the pills, Zeng Ye's complexion remained pale, and he felt overwhelming guilt, nearly brought to tears. "Mr. Chen, I'm sorry. I was too impatient."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, explaining to the young man, "Things can’t be approached with extremes. Today, you weren’t truly impatient; rather, you faced a crucial barrier that you needed to push through, but you just didn’t succeed. So, I won’t keep account of these pills. There's a difference between being overly ambitious and being afraid to take action. You need to clearly distinguish between the two, as well as the 'middle path' of your Dao heart that you should pursue. In your future cultivation, you must think this through. Otherwise, when you hit a bottleneck later, you’ll instinctively retreat, becoming timid, which will only hinder your progress on the path to enlightenment."

Zeng Ye wiped his face and smiled, "I’ll remember!"

Chen Ping'an said, "Remembering is one thing; you need to think more deeply about it. Otherwise, it will never become a stepping stone for your ascent. Since you admit you’re not very bright, you must put in more effort on things that clever people can do without pausing. Suffer more to gain more."

Zeng Ye nodded.

The reasoning was simple enough for him to understand.

Chen Ping'an took a sip from his sword-brewing gourd and hesitated for a moment. "Only after exhausting all your efforts can you have even the slightest reason to complain about fate."

If it were in the past, Chen Ping'an would have undoubtedly said it was still inappropriate to blame fate.

In this moment, however, he refrained from saying such words.

He allowed Zeng Ye to focus on healing and digesting the energy from the pills.

As Chen Ping'an stood up, he suddenly turned his gaze.

Zeng Ye followed Chen Ping'an’s line of sight to see the bleak lakeside view outside the window, nothing unusual.

Furrowing his brows, Chen Ping'an said, "Don’t get distracted."

Zeng Ye immediately held his breath and focused.

Chen Ping'an stood up to help close the door, hesitating for a moment before choosing not to stroll by the dock to enjoy the scenery.

Instead, he returned to his own room.

He retrieved the King of Hell Hall from the bamboo box and tossed in several Snowflake Coins.

The divine coins were called such due to their pure spiritual energy, transcending the boundaries of yin and yang.

They could be used by both cultivators and spirits alike.

The Dao is impartial.

With the seasons turning, life and death intertwining, yin and yang separated, and time flowing by.

Chen Ping'an sat at his desk, flipping through a ledger filled with handwritten records.

He took out a secret elixir from the Water Palace of Pearl Island, swallowed it gently, and then began to close his eyes and cultivate. As the spiritual energy slowly flowed into his own water reserve, he felt a slight surplus. Chen Ping'an opened his eyes to review the names on the first page of the ledger along with their hometowns and life stories. This page recorded a total of nine individuals.

Taking a deep breath, he began to silently recite the incantations in his heart, fingers coming together to form a sword gesture as he pointed it at the King of Hell Hall, invoking the ghostly commands to summon the nine incomplete souls.

The room was already adorned with talismans and arranged in a formation suitable for spirits to return to the mortal realm and take root.

Three talismans were used: the "Cloud Water House-Settling Talismans" from the "True Records of Alchemical Books," with the central talisman inscribed with the names of the Three Mountains and Nine Marquis.

The second was the "Cypress Talismans," which could suppress the spirit if the atmosphere of the residence was akin to a ghostly form.

The final one was a talisman bestowed by a Yin-Yang practitioner, known as the "Peach Wood Nail Talisman," which could innately suppress the ferocity of ghostly entities, helping to restore their clarity of mind.

As for the formation that provided a "solid ground" for weak spirits in the mortal realm, it was learned from the Earth Immortal Yu Huai of Moonhook Island. Chen Ping'an had someone assist him in moving a large slab from the bottom of the Book Lake, carving it into stone plates and inscribing it with talismanic characters, embedding them underground to serve as flooring. Additionally, beneath the stone plates, he buried the "Fudeground of Destiny" purchased from other islands by Qingxia Island cultivators, filling it in various orientations.

With each name Chen Ping'an called out, a spirit emerged from the King of Hell Hall, standing on the green stone slab that occupied half the room.

These nine spirits were all from the homes of the chief offering of Qingxia Island and Master Gu Can, including both minor attendants and housemaids.

Earlier, Chen Ping'an had already informed all the spirits in the rooms of the loft, letting them know who he was, his relationship with Gu Can, and what he intended to do in Qingxia Island.

At this moment, the nine spirits, who had suffered untimely deaths and endured torment after death, displayed a range of emotions: anger, sorrow, confusion, pain, hatred, suspicion, surprise, indifference, and fear.

Chen Ping'an slowly said, "Do you have any last wishes? Are there unfinished matters you must attend to? For yourselves, for your families, or for your sect, you may speak; I will do my best to help fulfill your wishes."

On the table, besides the mountain of ledgers, there was also the sword-brewing gourd for refreshing oneself, and six paper dolls crafted meticulously from the Qifeng Paper by the Xu family, which allowed spirits to inhabit them, walking among the living without hindrance.

Chen Ping'an paused for a moment, "If we trace it back, I indeed owe you, as the little mudfish that Gu Can had was a gift from me. That’s why I sought you all out, to converse with you. In truth, I don’t owe you anything because our positions are set here at the Book Lake. The Buddhist concept of cause and effect applies to me, of course, but it’s not significant; suffering in this life is due to causes from previous lives, as per Buddhist teachings. According to Legalist philosophy, it’s even less relevant to me. Following the Daoist path, one only needs to sever ties with the mundane, distance oneself from the secular, and seek tranquility. Yet, I won’t deem this as right, so I will do my utmost."

No one spoke first.

Inside the room, the living and the dead fell into a long silence together.

Regardless of the emotions and mindsets they currently held, when the spirits looked at the young man seated behind the desk, they saw in him a reflection of their own feelings, each different from the others.

Like a mirror reflecting back.

Joy and sorrow intertwined.

One of the female spirits, formerly an attendant, suddenly glared fiercely, "I want you to pay with your life! Can you do that?!"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "Of course, I cannot."

She sneered, "Then what kind of false benevolence are you showing? You deserve to die, just like that bastard Gu Can! You should be crushed to pieces, leaving no place to bury you!"

Chen Ping'an regarded her.

Her face twisted with deep-seated hatred, she charged forward, but just as she was about to cross the green stone slab, she hit an invisible wall and was flung back violently. She fell, struggled to rise again, and came to the invisible barrier, spreading her fingers wide, appearing crazed as she clawed at the invisible threshold. "I died, and you won’t have a good death either! You’re just putting on an act here; you deserve to die even more than that guy Gu Can..."

Finally, she collapsed to the ground, sobbing.

Chen Ping'an rose to his feet, and the other eight spirits instinctively took a step back.

He walked around the desk and squatted down by the green stone slab.

She looked up, "I just don’t want to die. I just want to live. Is that wrong?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "No."

He sat cross-legged, speaking softly, "Your name is Bai Licao, originally Bai Mei'er. You were a third-tier practitioner from the Bottle Lane in Su County of the Shihai Kingdom. You had an arranged marriage. When you were fourteen, a cultivator from Qingxia Island discovered your potential, and they bought you from your parents for three hundred taels of silver. Your parents then changed their minds, wanting an additional three hundred taels, but the cultivator killed them all in front of you. Once you arrived on Qingxia Island, the chief offering took a liking to you and made you an attendant. You detested the name Bai Mei'er, so you changed it to Bai Licao, even spending twelve Snowflake Coins at the incense house to do so. In the end, you died under the hand of Gu Can’s dragon-like attendant, your body left in a terrible state. Your obsession is strong, your souls remain intact, but you were captured by the ghost cultivator Ma Yuan of the Zhu Xian Mansion, imprisoned in a well, and he intended to turn you into a ghost soldier. I brought you out of the well and into this King of Hell Hall."

She wiped away her tears, "You can do whatever you want with me, but as long as Gu Can lives, I will never rest in peace! Life and death, I will remember Gu Can..."

Her gaze was resolute, "And you! Aren't you supposed to be powerful? Why don’t you just scatter my soul into nothingness? Then I won't have to see you anymore!"

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

He stood up.

Another young spirit, also from the ranks of attendants, timidly spoke, "Even if I remain in this ghostly form, I’m willing. Will I no longer have to endure the agony of my soul?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Yes. If you have any other wishes, feel free to tell me."

She perked up, her demeanor graceful, and she offered Chen Ping'an a deep bow.

One of the originally indifferent female spirits pointed at the King of Hell Hall on the table, "I want to be reincarnated. I don’t want to be trapped in this ghostly place anymore. Can you do that?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Releasing you to be reincarnated is certainly not difficult, but I cannot guarantee you will be reborn as a human, especially whether you will enjoy blessings in your next life. I can only promise that I will hold a grand Daoist ritual and a Buddhist water and land assembly for spirits who make the same choice as you, to pray for your blessings. Furthermore, I will also follow the mountain rules to increase your merits. I can do things like setting up a porridge stall in the war-torn Shihai Kingdom in your name to aid the refugees. There are many things I can do."

She paused for a moment, seemingly reconsidering, "Can I think about it some more?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Of course."

She suddenly asked, "Do you know my name?"

Chen Ping'an softly said, "I do, and I also know that many of the couplets from the less significant places in the previous residence were written by you. I went specifically to find them, but sadly, the place now called Chunting Mansion has replaced them all."

She burst into tears.

Chen Ping'an said, "I'm sorry."

She remained silent, simply crying.

One of the spirits, who had been the most panicked earlier, was a middle-aged servant who habitually bent over when speaking. He trembled and said, "Divine Sir, my name is Jia Gao. It doesn't matter if you don’t remember my name; I just want to be able to visit my parents' graves. But it's a bit far, outside of the Shihai Kingdom, in the small vassal state of Chunhua under the Zhu Ying Dynasty. If it’s too much trouble for you, then forget it. Just please, Divine Sir, if you really can hold the grand Daoist ritual and the water and land assembly, and help us accumulate some merits for a smooth reincarnation, I won’t blame Gu Can anymore."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "I know your hometown; I will go to Chunhua as well, and I will summon you when the time comes."

Jia Gao immediately broke down in tears, bending over to thank him, "The expenses for visiting the graves will trouble you, Divine Sir, and I can only repay it in my next life."

Chen Ping'an turned to grab the sword-brewing gourd, taking a large sip of alcohol before walking back to a distance, "Is that all? Just these?"

The middle-aged spirit wiped his face in a fluster, "That’s enough!"

Chen Ping'an's lips moved slightly, maintaining a serious expression without speaking.

Suddenly, another spirit rubbed his hands and laughed, a robust man, flattering, "Divine Sir, I don’t seek reincarnation, nor would I dare trouble you with anything too arduous. I just have a small wish that won’t cost you a single Snowflake Coin or distract you in the slightest."

Chen Ping'an narrowed his eyes, his expression unchanging, "Zhao Shi, go ahead."

The former minor steward of Chunting Mansion glanced at the nearby female spirits and grinned, "My only wish is to stay in your heavenly residence, Divine Sir, and then to continue managing a few attendants just like when I was alive. However, now I want to think a bit more, hoping to visit their quarters and do some… manly things. When I was alive, I could only steal glances; I never dared to indulge myself, so today I implore the Divine Sir for mercy. Will you grant it?"

The first female spirit, Bai Licao, sneered coldly.

Chen Ping'an nodded, pulling the corners of his mouth, "Sure, that’s a minor request."

The man bowed deeply, "Divine Sir is wise."

Chen Ping'an, without needing to consult the ledger, slowly said, "Zhao Shi, like your ancestors, comes from Qingxia Island. You were a second-tier steward at Lantern Flower Mansion, responsible for managing the daily needs and salaries of a dozen attendants. You had two opportunities each year to leave the Book Lake to seek out servants for Lantern Flower Mansion in the surrounding areas of the Shihai Kingdom. According to the secret records of the incense house, there’s only one notable deed in your life, which is likely your greatest achievement: you once clashed with a female cultivator from another region in Yunlou City, and using the name and connections of Qingxia Island, you had the local cultivators humiliate her to death, throwing her body into the lake."

The man’s face turned awkward, "You’re making a joke of me, Divine Sir."

Chen Ping'an stepped onto the green stone slab, gripping the spirit’s neck with a blank expression, "A joke? I don’t find it amusing."

As Chen Ping'an tightened his grip, the man writhed in agony, "Chen Ping'an! You’re breaking your word! I curse you..."

Chen Ping'an raised his arm, lifting him off the ground, preventing the dying spirit from speaking another word, and slowly said, "I’m keeping my word. In your next life, make sure to handle it like you did with that young female cultivator in Yunlou City; just ensure you’re born well. As for whether you’ll have the chance after your soul scatters, that’s beyond my control. By the way, do you remember that female cultivator’s name? I do; it was Wei Qingyu."

The spirit in Chen Ping'an's grip disintegrated into ashes, scattering into the air.

Chen Ping'an stepped back from the green stone slab, coughing a few times, and returned to his desk, gazing at the green stone slab.

One male and one female spirit, who had initially felt joy and suspicion, suddenly knelt down to bow.

An hour later.

Chen Ping'an opened the door and stepped outside.

Zeng Ye was already standing at the doorway, spotting his figure, and turned with a smile, "Mr. Chen, it’s snowing! Heavy snow! This is the first big snow of the year at Book Lake."

However, Zeng Ye quickly fell silent, somewhat disheartened.

For a great cultivator like Mr. Chen, did it truly matter whether it snowed or not, or whether it was heavy or light?

Chen Ping'an lifted his head.

His hands were tucked within his sleeves.

The snow fell thickly.

But only when the snow melted does the coldest time arrive. After the snow melts, the roads will become muddy.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 476: A Heavy Snow Signals a Good Year

Even someone as seasoned as Zhang Ye, the elder of Shujian Lake, could not have anticipated the magnitude and duration of today’s snowfall.

The snow fell with a fierce intensity, almost as if it were trying to raise the water level of Shujian Lake by a foot.

A heavy snow signals a good year.

This was not merely a saying from the streets; for the tens of thousands of wild cultivators around Shujian Lake, it held true as well. Rain and snow, these ephemeral waters, were nothing but beneficial for the lake’s spiritual energy and water transport. Each island probably wished that this heavy snow would fall solely upon them, showering them not with snowflakes but with piles of divine money.

In fact, many local earth immortals had already ascended to the heavens, employing their magical abilities to secure tangible benefits for their respective islands.

On this day of the winter solstice, following the customs of her hometown, the Spring Courtyard (Chunting Fu) prepared dumplings.

The day before, the little loach had finally overcome her injuries and quietly returned to the shore. Today, Gu Can sent her to call Chen Ping’an to the courtyard for dumplings. As she spoke, Gu Can was busy at the stove with her mother. The kitchen of Spring Courtyard was now larger than the combined kitchens of Gu Can's and Chen Ping'an's ancestral homes in Mud Bottle Alley.

On her way to the mountain gate, the little loach was curious about what Gu Can said Chen Ping’an might be entrusting to her. 

She had heard that Chen Ping’an had recently been reclusive, hardly leaving his home. When he did step out, it was only to gaze at the snow-covered lake, a stark contrast to his previous wanderings around Shujian Lake.

She still felt a bit intimidated by Chen Ping’an.

Initially, her return to Pool Water City had been marked by an instinctive reverence due to the profundity of his Dao. After Chen Ping’an's battle with Liu Lao Cheng, which led to the little loach receiving a name—“Charcoal Snow” (Tan Xue)—she felt even more fearful.

Yet, she genuinely liked Gu Can as her master and was grateful to Chen Ping’an for gifting her to Gu Can back then.

When she was near Chen Ping’an, she felt restrained.

She reached the door and gently knocked.

“It's not locked, come in,” Chen Ping’an's hoarse voice came from inside. “Just be careful not to step on the bluestone slab.”

As she opened the door, the cold air from the winter snow swept into the room.

At first, she didn’t pay much attention; she had always felt a natural affinity for the chill of winter. But when she saw Chen Ping’an sitting at the writing desk, his complexion pale and beginning to cough, she quickly closed the door, circled around the large bluestone slab that served as a mat, and timidly stood near the desk. “Sir, Gu Can asked me to invite you to the Spring Courtyard for dumplings.”

Chen Ping’an had stopped writing and was using a handmade bamboo-and-copper warming stove on his lap, trying to drive away the cold with the warmth of the charcoal. “I won’t be going. Please tell Gu Can and her mother that I apologize.”

She softly said, “If you’re worried about the wind and snow outside, the charcoal can help a little.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “It’s fine.”

She wanted to say more, but when she glanced at Chen Ping’an's eyes, she immediately quelled her thoughts.

“Do you know why I named you Charcoal Snow?” Chen Ping’an asked.

She shook her head.

“‘Ice and charcoal cannot share a furnace.’ This is something even a child would understand, right?” he continued.

She nodded.

“Thus, charcoal and snow can share a furnace, and they can be close to one another. That’s one reason. The other is a bit selfish on my part. When I see you, I remind myself that gifting you to Gu Can was indeed an act of providing warmth in the midst of snow. If—” 

He paused, raising a hand from the warming stove to pick up a carving knife from the table.

This action made the little loach, a heavily injured Nascent Soul cultivator, involuntarily shudder.

On the table lay a newly crafted bamboo scabbard and bamboo knife, which he had made last night. Originally, he intended to ask Zeng Ye, who loved the snowy scenery, to fetch or buy some bamboo from Zizhu Island. However, thinking that a green bamboo knife would look better, he changed his mind and had Zeng Ye simply chop down a stalk of green bamboo on Qingxia Island and bring it back. Chen Ping’an worked through the night to craft the knife and scabbard. The leftover scraps were then fashioned into small bamboo slips, scattered across the table. Unlike the previously inscribed slips, these new bamboo slips from Qingxia Island varied in length and thickness.

At that moment, Chen Ping’an picked up the longest slip, gently slicing it near one end to create two uneven pieces. Then he repeatedly cut the longer piece, creating segments resembling the nodes of a bamboo stalk.

In the misty alley, with the sun shining high above the fields, between the two ancestral homes of Mud Bottle Alley, the splendid Spring Courtyard stood proudly, and the boundless Shujian Lake lay beyond.

This scene, although the little loach had no idea what Chen Ping’an was doing, still made her heart race with fear.

Facing the fearless Liu Lao Cheng, this descendant of the true dragon felt like a child awaiting punishment, standing before a teacher ready to deliver a reprimand.

Chen Ping’an did not lift his gaze but focused intently on the repeatedly severed bamboo slip. “In my hometown, there’s a saying: ‘Lotus does not cross bridges; bamboo does not cross ditches.’ Have you ever heard it?”

The little loach hesitated before softly replying, “In Lizhu Cave, my spiritual awareness was still dormant. It wasn’t until I arrived at Qingxia Island that I began to truly remember things. Later, at the Spring Courtyard, I heard Gu Can's mother mention it in passing.”

Chen Ping’an finally looked up and smiled. “You have a temperament just like Gu Can. But this knowledge you speak of, did you learn it from her mother?”

The little loach fell silent, her eyelashes trembling, looking pitiful.

Chen Ping’an continued, “I have already felt guilty twice regarding Gu Can. As for her mother, I consider that debt settled. Now, only you remain, little loach.”

Slowly, she lifted her head, her golden, slitted eyes fixed intensely on the man behind the desk.

The atmosphere in the room was so heavy that the wind and snow outside howled in response.

She felt weak, but how much better was he? He was just as sickly!

Once the matter of the Dao and life and death came into play, she would not hesitate for even a moment. Outside of that, she could follow Chen Ping’an’s lead, be obedient, and regard him with the respect of a half-master.

Her connection with Gu Can was not simply coincidental; their Dao resonated.

Chen Ping’an coughed lightly, flicking his wrist to place a golden rope on the table, mocking, “What’s this? Trying to scare me? How about you look at the fate of your kind?”

The little loach immediately recognized the origin of that golden rope and felt her heart drop.

Other wild cultivators in Shujian Lake—let alone someone like Liu Zhimiao, a powerful Nascent Soul—would not react with the same dread she felt upon seeing this treasure.

Chen Ping’an put down the carving knife and picked up the Binding Demon Rope, crafted from the whiskers of an elder dragon from Jiao Long Gorge. He stepped out from behind the desk and slowly approached her. “Of course, I didn’t personally slay this elder dragon, nor was the Binding Demon Rope made by me. It was crafted by friends of a great sword master, who killed the old dragon. The one who commissioned the crafting was another great sword master. The fate of the elder dragon, who was about to enter the Jade Purity realm, is just like this. Gu Can might not know, but do you also not know that Shujian Lake is too small for you? It will only continue to shrink.”

Chen Ping’an stood before her. “You help Gu Can kill this and that, enjoying it thoroughly. What’s the end goal? Of course, since you two are intimately connected in the Dao, you wouldn’t harm Gu Can. But aside from that, you’re still foolishly thinking of helping Gu Can secure a footing while aiding Liu Zhimiao and Qingxia Island to swallow the entire Shujian Lake. In that case, you could feast on half the waters of Shujian Lake, using that as your gamble to risk entering the Jade Purity realm, right?”

With the Binding Demon Rope in hand, he sharply poked her forehead with a finger. “How big of a bowl can you hold? Don’t you understand this simple principle? Aren’t you afraid of choking to death?!”

Her face flushed with anger, and she trembled all over, desperately wanting to claw out the heart of this sickly man before her.

But she didn’t dare.

One significant reason was the half-immortal weapon currently hanging on the wall.

It wasn’t about any feelings or connections.

Deep down, she sensed a strange aura emanating from Chen Ping’an, one that exuded a natural dominance.

Initially, she had mistakenly thought it was merely due to a fortuitous encounter with the Dao from years past.

But later, she realized it was much more than that.

Due to her own limited perspective and experience, she had fallen short compared to a fellow like Wu Yi, the founding ancestor of Ziyang Palace in Huangting Nation. Wu Yi, being a Golden Core earth immortal, could see through the truth at a glance—Chen Ping’an was entangled with the karma of slaying dragons. As for why it was so heavy, even Wu Yi didn’t know or understand. The only one likely to have guessed the general outline was her father—the ancient dragon who had gone to Bi Yun Mountain to serve as the deputy headmaster of Lu Shu Academy. Unfortunately, he would never openly tell his daughter.

Chen Ping’an repeatedly poked her forehead. “You don’t even know how to be a clever villain and truly think you can live long?! Go take a look at the Sword Qi Great Wall. In every hundred years, how many earth immortal sword cultivators die?! Have you seen the sword from the Wei Jin of the Wind and Snow Temple? Have you seen A Liang, who was punched back to the Hao Ran World and then punched back into the Qing Ming World? Have you seen a sword cultivator effortlessly level Jiao Long Gorge? Have you seen how the first cultivator of Tong Ye Continent, Du Mao, died and disappeared?”

He withdrew his hand, coughing repeatedly, his voice hoarse. “You’ve only seen a Jade Purity realm Liu Lao Cheng, and he nearly died.”

She seethed with rage, gritting her teeth.

The murderous intent in her golden eyes grew denser, and she didn’t bother to hide it.

Chen Ping’an smirked, gazing at this so-called true dragon descendant who had everything going her way. “What exactly makes you and Gu Can think that killing others is not wrong, and that being killed is also without regret? A person like Gu Can, someone like you, and her seemingly shrewd mother—if I didn’t know you, do you think that even if I passed by Shujian Lake, even with my meager strength, without throwing a single punch or sword, just by having tea and chatting with Liu Zhimiao, Liu Lao Cheng, and the island master of Li Su Island, I could stay in Shujian Lake for a few years and you all could die several times?”

She sneered, “Then go ahead and kill! Why don’t you?”

In that moment, she seemed to brighten, smiling, “I know. You, Chen Ping’an, have come this far, you’re far smarter than Gu Can. You’re meticulous, calculating every step, even probing into the minutiae of human nature. But so what? Isn’t the Dao collapsing? Chen Ping’an, do you really know how Gu Can felt that night? You say it was a misstep in cultivation that made you spit blood. Gu Can may not be as clever as you, but he’s not foolish either. Doesn’t he know you’re lying? I’m a Nascent Soul cultivator, can’t I see the huge problem with your body? But Gu Can, he’s soft-hearted, just a child who’s too timid to ask. I, on the other hand, am unwilling to speak. If your strength weakens by a fraction, I can fear you a fraction less. The truth is, I was half-wrong; I shouldn’t have viewed you merely as someone relying on status and background. Oh dear, just as Mr. Chen said, I’m rather foolish, aren’t I? Luckily, I guessed right about half of it. You managed to stop Liu Lao Cheng with just your own strength, and now I’m alive while you’re heavily injured. With this exchange, I could slap you dead just like I would any ant that can’t even be used as a supplement.”

Chen Ping’an casually tossed the Binding Demon Rope onto the table, pressed his palms together, and smiled. “That’s exactly right. If we don’t say these things out loud, I’ll end up feeling exhausted for you. You really didn’t play that part well, and I can see it clearly. We’re both tired of this. Now, we’re actually on the same line.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Stop pretending to be mysterious here.”

Chen Ping’an extended a hand, fingers spread wide. “Including Zeng Ye, just the two of us can actually be considered a separate line, forming the fifth line.”

She sneered, “Chen Ping’an, you’re not trying to tell me you’ve been too involved with those dark beings and gone mad, are you? Or perhaps you’re going down the wrong path? What, are you so ambitious you want to imitate that Lord of Baidi City? Starting from becoming the master of Shujian Lake? It’s not impossible; Mr. Chen has gotten to know so many remarkable figures. With them backing you up, what can’t you achieve? And I, a mere little loach not even worthy of your notice, could be crushed by them with a single finger.”

Chen Ping’an smiled genuinely, finding her words amusing, and they provided a new cognitive possibility for him. This way, the connections between the two lines would become clearer.

His smile made the tense atmosphere in the room ease a bit.

He gestured for her to sit down and talk, while he turned to walk back to the desk.

Exposing his back to her like that.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 477: The Birds Vanished in the Ice Cave (Part 1)

She neither made a move nor took a step. "Since Mr. Chen is a man who enjoys discussing rules, I will just stand here and speak."

Chen Ping'an sat back in his chair, holding the charcoal stove to warm his hands. After rubbing them together, he exhaled a puff of breath. "Let me tell you a small story. Back when I had just left the Li Pearl Cave Heaven and was on my journey to the Great Sui, not long after departing from Red Candle Town, I encountered an elderly scholar on a ferry. He spoke up with righteous indignation, even though it was others who were being unreasonable first. At that time, I couldn't understand it; the confusion weighed heavily on my heart. Today, thanks to you and this Lake of Manuscripts, I can understand his perspective. He may not have been right, but he certainly wasn't as absurdly wrong as I initially thought. Back then, I was at most correct, but not necessarily right."

Chen Ping'an smiled and drew a circle in the air with his finger.

"In the martial world, drinking is part of the realm; committing acts of violence is part of the realm; acting with chivalry is part of the realm; bloodshed and chaos are still part of the realm. On the battlefield, you kill me, I kill you; heroically sacrificing oneself is part of the battlefield, and ambushing surrendering soldiers by the tens of thousands is also part of it. The ancient battlefields where the spirits of the valiant refuse to disperse are still part of it. In the court, governing the country and helping the people is part of the court; chaos and tyranny are also part of the court; when a young lord is suspected and a woman listens behind the curtain, that too is part of the court. Someone once told me that in the homeland of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, there are those who, to save their law-breaking fathers, rallied friends and killed all the officials and soldiers, and were thus regarded as great filial sons. In the end, they became high officials, leaving their names in the annals of history. Others, out of loyalty to friends, upon hearing of a friend's death, traveled a thousand miles in one night to avenge them, slaughtering the enemies' entire household under the moonlight, and returned unscathed, only to be seen as modern-day heroes, pursued by the authorities for miles, helped by countless people along the way. This person was admired by many in life and even included in the legends of chivalry after death."

Chen Ping'an drew an even larger circle. "Initially, I, too, found this hard to believe, thinking that if I ever encountered such a person, I could kill them with just two punches, which would still feel excessive. But now I realize that back then, this was the prevailing folk customs of the entire world, a summation of all knowledge. Just like in the narrow alleys of Mud Bottle Lane, in each corner of Red Candle Town, and in the scholarly exchanges of Cloud City, this was the era's universally recognized family teachings and social norms. However, as time passes, everything changes. If I had lived in that era, I might have admired such a person. It’s not just about punching them; perhaps upon meeting, I would even have to salute them."

"There was an old Daoist who calculated my deepest vulnerabilities, and this is where he hit me hardest. He only showed me three hundred years of flowing time, and I dare say, that was a stretch of time that flowed more slowly, and it was a segment of the river that was relatively complete compared to the world’s chaos, just enough to allow me to see without excess or deficiency. If it had been less, I wouldn't have grasped the intricacies of the Daoist's academic lineage, and if it had been more, I would have had to return to the teachings of an old gentleman."

Chen Ping'an appeared to be quite cold now, his shoulders slumping as he kept his hands on the charcoal stove, smiling as he spoke. "You, Liu Zhimou, and even those truly standing at the peak of Daoism are just worlds apart from him and that other 'young' Daoist."

He tilted his chin slightly towards her. "In the depths of one’s nature, there should be a piece of the heart that is the most muddied. No matter how clear the source of the spring water, once it flows into the fields, it will inevitably become turbid. Take, for example, almost everyone deep inside their hearts is contradictory and unaware. The Lake of Manuscripts is the best example of this, contrasting with the quarrels of yesteryears and the worry-free land of the White World, perfectly embodying two extremes. What's wrong? Can't you understand? Then let me say something you might barely grasp."

"When faced with right and wrong, many people, when they are uninvolved, will often choose to side with the weaker party, showing an innate dislike for the strong. They fervently wish to see them fall from grace, and they will even blame the good, hoping to find flaws in a moral saint. Conversely, they greatly admire the occasional good deeds of evildoers. The reasoning isn't complex; we are all fighting for that small 'one,' striving for balance so that a small group doesn't occupy too much space. This has little to do with good and evil anymore. To put it further, this is actually beneficial for all of us, better distributing the larger 'one' so that no one ascends too high or descends too low. It's like... grasshoppers on a rope; the bigger ones can jump higher and farther, while the weaker ones are dragged along. Even if they stumble and bleed along the way, they can still keep up, huddling together for warmth, and won't be easily pecked by birds. This is why so many people in the world love to speak reason, yet when those around them are unreasonable, they still find joy in it. This is the nature of the heart—when the world starts to demand a higher price for reason, being unreasonable becomes the foundation for survival. Being close to these 'strong' individuals allows one to strive for more tangible benefits. The so-called helping one's kin over reason is precisely this. Gu Can's mother, staying close to Gu Can and you, or even Liu Zhimou, would feel more stable, and that’s the reason. It's not that she... was particularly wrong in this matter. It's just that an initially not wrong lineage constantly extends outwards, like lotuses and bamboo, leading to various conflicts with established rules. But you all simply overlook those trivial details; you're only focused on collapsing bridges and filling ditches. So I told Gu Can, all those innocent lives he took were once a reflection of me, Chen Ping'an, back in those days of Mud Bottle Lane, just as he is now. He still can't take it in."

"I have done so much here; one day the truth will come to light. I want Gu Can to open his eyes wide and watch closely. If he refuses to listen to reason, then so be it. But for me, Chen Ping'an, being here is not just to help him; it’s also to correct my own mistakes and make amends. I need him to understand a truth beyond the books. In the Lake of Manuscripts, within two years, when a cultivator stands high enough, they don't need to resort to senseless slaughter to establish their reputation. I can still live more securely and stand taller than Gu Can."

She hesitated, wanting to say something.

Chen Ping'an chuckled. "What, are you going to say that I have too many supporters and too many treasures? That you and Gu Can can't compare to me? Have you ever thought that I am holding onto all these? I can explain it word by word to you, yet you still wouldn't understand, because even if I say it, you know the reasoning, yet you can't act on it. Isn't that interesting? It's your nature; when your character is set like ceramic, there is no one to lead you away from it. But none of this matters. Even if there were such a person, I would consider it a waste of effort. Speaking of this is already pointless. What’s important is that you don’t even know how to be a slightly clever bad person, so you’re even less willing and know even less about how to be a slightly clever good person."

The little loach bit her lip, remaining silent for a moment, before her first words were, "Chen Ping'an, don’t force me to kill you today!"

Chen Ping'an tilted his head slightly, smiling as he asked, "Why kill me? By killing me, wouldn’t you and Gu Can, along with the Spring Court, lose a support? See, I just said you were foolish; you're being stupidly bad and still won’t admit it."

The sound of her boots softly rubbing against the ground echoed beneath her. 

Chen Ping'an ignored it, pointing towards the adjacent room where Zeng Ye was staying.

"Over there is a good person, also not very old, who learns things slowly. Yet, I still hope he can live well in the Lake of Manuscripts as a good person, though it won’t be easy; still, hope exists. Of course, if I find that I cannot change him, or if I discover that those depths of calculation you speak of still can’t guarantee his survival, then I will let him be, allowing him to perish by his own methods in the Lake of Manuscripts."

There had once been a detail where Chen Ping'an picked up a stool, but Zeng Ye, completely unaware, forgot to bring it into the room. 

If this was merely a reflection of the naive youth Zeng Ye, unacquainted with the world, simple-hearted, unable to see what lay ahead, then during his cultivation, he even distractedly followed Chen Ping'an's gaze to look out the window. This left Chen Ping'an feeling a bit helpless. Yet it could still be explained, for he was inexperienced and lacking adequate tempering. He could still wait for Zeng Ye's growth, and on the chessboard, every step taken was slow yet without error, so there was no need to overthink the outcome, ultimately leading to a higher probability of victory. But if fate truly dictated death, then that would just be destiny. Just like what Chen Ping'an said to Zeng Ye, when that time comes, just be guiltless and don’t blame heaven and earth.

However, what moved Chen Ping'an the most was that he needed to recognize the signs and couldn't avoid clarifying things. He had to make it clear for the first time, subtly knocking on the heart of the young man whose thoughts were stirring, bluntly telling Zeng Ye that their relationship was merely transactional, not that of master and disciple. Chen Ping'an was not his preacher or protector.

To say Zeng Ye's nature was bad would be an exaggeration; on the contrary, having experienced life-and-death tribulations, he still held onto a certain respect for his master and Maoyue Island. This, in fact, was one of the fundamental reasons Chen Ping'an was willing to keep him around, carrying equal weight to Zeng Ye's cultivation roots and affinity for the ghostly arts.

Yet even with such a Zeng Ye, who allowed Chen Ping'an to see echoes of his own past, this young man from the Lake of Manuscripts, when carefully probed, could not withstand even a slight push. 

Zeng Ye, appearing to be the opposite of Gu Can in temperament, was supposed to be the fourth path Chen Ping'an wanted to observe closely, analyzing Zeng Ye’s future actions and inner journey. 

But when the time truly arrived, Chen Ping'an still went against his original intention, hoping Zeng Ye wouldn’t stray too far, hoping to find a place between the two extremes of "taking for oneself" and "receiving from others" where his character wouldn't waver or swing. 

But it didn’t matter; even as he intervened, he slightly altered the trajectory of that lineage. The line remained the same; it was just a minor deviation in its path. He could continue to observe its direction, just with a slight difference from what he had anticipated. 

Compared to the bloodshed of the woman before him, Zeng Ye's path, this young man's life, was still filled with countless possibilities and opportunities for goodness. 

As for whether the waters of Zeng Ye's heart would one day encounter disaster and flow from a pure and kind place to a harsh and extreme self, Chen Ping'an would not force that. 

Within the rules, there is freedom, and each must pay their own price. 

Human efforts will eventually reach their limits. Even Gu Can, Chen Ping'an has given up on, cutting ties and delineating boundaries thoroughly, starting to pursue his own affairs under the premise of stopping the killing and correcting mistakes. 

What does it matter if there's another Zeng Ye?

Chen Ping'an's expression fell into a daze.

Back in the early days in the Li Pearl Cave Heaven, at the entrance of that small town's wooden fence.

Inside was a boy still wearing straw sandals, with mud-stained legs.

Outside stood Cai Jin, Fu Nanhua, the Xu family from Qingfeng City, and the mountain-moving ape from the Right Yang Mountain, along with the girl who shouted about bringing Cloud-Dispersing Mountain home to turn it into her little garden.

That was the first time Chen Ping'an encountered travelers from outside the small town, all of whom were mountain people, regarded as deities in the eyes of ordinary scholars. 

Fortunately, among them was a girl who once said, "The Dao should not be so trivial."

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 478: The Ice Cavern of the Flying Birds (Part 2)**

Chen Ping'an arrived at the Booklet Lake.

It was only when his goodness and evil collided, leaving him bloodied and battered, that he realized how many flaws and cracks marred his heart's mirror. 

For instance, he had to start admitting that he was one of the mountain people—at least half of one. Otherwise, he would be continually rejecting himself because of the existence of the Mountain Moving Monkey, which was a fundamental flaw in the great Dao.

So, years ago, in the Lotus Flower Paradise, amidst the river of time, he had constructed a golden bridge. Yet, deep down, his true self clearly told him: as soon as he stepped onto it, the bridge would collapse, and he would undoubtedly plunge into the river.

With a sigh, Chen Ping'an remarked, "A moment's distraction, and you little mud loach, I gave you two chances, yet you still wouldn’t dare to kill me?"

She replied coldly, "Isn't it still all part of your scheme? According to your reasoning, rules are omnipresent. Here, you hide your rules, perhaps a concealed formation you've secretly set up, or perhaps that binding spell that naturally restrains me. Who knows? Besides, you said it yourself—killing you would bring me no benefit; I would lose a mountain of support and a protective talisman for nothing."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Does this mean I’ve finally made my point?"

Her face was full of sarcasm. "Are you saying that I’m the type of person who only chooses the arguments I want to hear?"

Chen Ping'an gently shook his head.

With a forced smile, she said, "What can you teach me, sir? I am all ears."

Chen Ping'an retorted, "You're not even human; you're just a beast. If I had known this would happen, back in the Li Zhu Cave, I wouldn't have given that little snot-nosed brat anything. I would have cooked and eaten you instead, and we wouldn’t be dealing with all this mess now."

She smiled and said, "I won’t get angry, just to spite you. I won’t give you the opportunity to cut ties or define me."

Chen Ping'an clicked his tongue in approval. "You’ve made progress. But don’t you doubt that I’m just putting on a show?"

She shook her head. "After our frank discussion, I gained a lot. There’s one thing I’ve grasped: you, Mr. Chen, are currently acting benevolently for your own sake. I can’t do the same, but I can obediently avoid making mistakes on your side. If I don’t give you any reason to target me, wouldn’t that only further irritate you, Mr. Chen, who is clearly smart yet likes to adhere to rules and reason? If you kill me, the path of Gu Can would be damaged, and the Bridge of Longevity would inevitably shatter. He doesn’t possess your tenacity; he wouldn’t be able to rise step by step again. He might end up as a useless person for the rest of his life. Can you truly bear that, Mr. Chen?"

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Indeed, how can a little snot-nosed brat compare to me? He doesn’t even understand what kind of person his own mother is, nor does he fathom what thoughts a creature connected to the great Dao might have. He doesn’t know how Liu Zhimiao, with his iron-fisted methods, manages people’s hearts, nor does he grasp how Lü Caizang truly builds connections. Even the fool Fan Yan doesn’t want to consider whether he’s truly foolish or not. He doesn’t worry about the worst-case scenarios; how can Gu Can compare to me? He’s still young, but here at Booklet Lake, give him another ten or twenty years, and he will still be unable to think more deeply."

Their words flowed easily, as if the discussion was light.

Leaning back in his chair, Chen Ping'an felt the warmth in his hands. "Life is so strange. I kill the river demon of the yellow eel, and I end up with karma on my hands. Gu Can, on the other hand, has killed so many innocent people at Booklet Lake, yet among those, he has inadvertently taken out a few deserving ones—just a tiny fraction. Outside of the major karmic repercussions, he’s even gained a little bit of merit. Your Booklet Lake truly is a place that evokes both laughter and tears. If one were to unleash a massacre against those mundane scholars and not target the mountain and wild cultivators, perhaps they would all be wiped out, resulting in at least a balance of merits and demerits? Of course, I dare not assert this; it’s merely a guess born from boredom."

It was indeed laughable.

This line of reasoning lingered around Booklet Lake, ripe for contemplation.

The living were like this, and so too were the dead.

She still smiled brightly. "All these messy matters don’t concern me; I’m not Mr. Chen, so I won’t care. As for being called a beast, if that makes you happy, so be it! After all, it is true."

Chen Ping'an laughed brightly. "Back in my hometown, even after two journeys across countless rivers and lakes, I never thought of myself as a good person, even when two very important individuals called me a soft-hearted fool. I didn’t believe it at all. Now, here in your Booklet Lake, I’m on the verge of becoming a moral saint! What a ridiculous world we live in, what a farcical set of rules at Booklet Lake. Have you all become addicted to eating feces?"

The young steward’s tone was slow, and while his words posed a question, his tone remained almost monotonous, as if he were telling a small joke.

She covered her mouth, laughing playfully. "Mr. Chen, if you have the ability to talk to Gu Can like this, I won’t be able to take it in. I’ll just treat it as the wind passing by my ears. Gu Can is currently unstable; it would be better to pick a sunny day after a snowfall. You and that little snot-nosed brat can sit on a small bamboo chair, one speaking, the other listening—just like at the dinner table before. Gu Can would likely be willing to listen now, perhaps he won’t take it seriously, but at least he’d be willing to hear it out."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "I’ll consider it. After talking so much with you, did we forget the original matter?"

Tan Xue nodded, smiling. "Today is the Winter Solstice. I came to invite you, Mr. Chen, to have a family reunion over dumplings."

Chen Ping'an nodded again. "As for me, I promised Gu Can that I would give you something. Here it is."

He handed her a jade token inscribed with "I cultivate the vast righteous Qi."

She furrowed her brows, her heart stirred; she didn’t reach out to take the "fire coal." Instead, she held it in front of her, a puzzled look on her face.

Suddenly, her heart skipped a beat. Sure enough, a subtle anomaly appeared on the piece of blue stone slab beneath her feet. Not only that, but the binding spell flashed and vanished, wrapping around her waist.

She couldn’t help but chuckle coldly.

Then, it felt as if she had fallen into an ice cavern.

Looking down, then up again.

A fine golden thread stretched from the wall all the way into her heart, and then a blade of unmatched sharpness pierced through her body.

Chen Ping'an took out a porcelain bottle and poured a pill hidden in the Water Palace, swallowing it down. He then gently set the porcelain bottle on the table, raised a finger to his lips, and made a shushing gesture. "I advise you not to make a sound; otherwise, you’ll die immediately."

Seeing her not daring to move an inch—pierced through the heart by a half-immortal weapon—even a peak-stage Nascent Soul would be severely injured.

Chen Ping'an remained indifferent to her plight, silently absorbing the pill's spiritual energy, and slowly said, "Today is the Winter Solstice. In my hometown, the custom is to sit together and eat dumplings. I had previously spoken to Gu Can about that, calculated your healing speed as a Nascent Soul Jiao Dragon, and kept tabs on Gu Can’s physical condition to determine when you could come ashore. I remembered the approximate dinner time at the Spring Courtyard and considered that you probably didn’t want to appear in front of the cultivators of Qingxia Island; you would only use Earth Immortal magic to come here and knock on my door. So, not too early, not too late, around one incense stick before you knocked, I consumed three energy-replenishing pills. As for you, you don’t know my true roots; relying on your Nascent Soul cultivation, you’re even less inclined to investigate my Water Palace, so you don’t know that I can fully control this sword immortal right now, even if the cost is a bit high. But that’s fine; it’s worth it. For instance, when I scared you, saying that you’d die with a move, I was actually scaring you; otherwise, how could I replenish my energy? As for now, you really will die."

Chen Ping'an stood up, walked around the writing desk, and waved his hand, commanding the jade token to float up from the ground and gently grasp it in his hand.

He seemed completely unafraid of the desperate struggles and dying counterattacks of the mud loach. He stepped directly a few paces closer to her and asked with a smile, "With a framework of Nascent Soul, and the cultivation of Golden Core Earth Immortal, I truly don’t understand who gave you the audacity to openly harbor murderous intentions toward me. It’s one thing to have such intentions, but do you have the ability to support such murderous thoughts? Look at me; almost from the moment I set foot on Qingxia Island, I started scheming against you. After the battle with Liu Laocheng, when I recognized that you were even harder to teach than Gu Can, I began to make real plans. Inside the house, from start to finish, I’ve been talking reason with you. So, reason still needs to be discussed. Useless? I see it as very useful. It’s just that the way good people and bad people talk reason differs; many good people simply haven’t figured this out and have suffered so much for it, leaving this world indebted to them."

Chen Ping'an extended a hand, but instead of grasping the sword immortal, he pressed his palm against the sword's hilt, inch by inch, pushing it forward.

The sword continually advanced.

Chen Ping'an said, "In truth, even after taking that pill, I can’t really kill you. Now, it should be real. If you don’t believe me, struggle a bit; why not give it a try? Aren’t those who mix in Booklet Lake fond of gambling with their lives?"

After waiting a moment, Chen Ping'an laughed, "You’re not clever at all, but your luck isn’t too bad."

"Do you know why I never told you or Gu Can the name of this sword? It’s called Sword Immortal, the sword of the Land Sword Immortal. So I intentionally didn’t mention it."

"Think about it, in the ancient times of our Baoping Continent, where did Sword Immortals appear most frequently?"

"In the ancient Shu Kingdom."

"Why so many Sword Immortals? Because it was a place where dragons and jiao mixed, perfect for Sword Immortals to temper their blades."

Chen Ping'an concluded, "So, you’re right not to gamble with your life. This sword, even without me taking that last pill, after tasting your heart's fresh blood, it’s already itching to shatter your heart. There’s no need for me to spend spiritual energy and focus to control it. The reason I took the medicine was to restrain it, so it wouldn’t kill you immediately."

As a true dragon descendant, naturally unafraid of the cold, and among the five true descendants closest to water manipulation, she was experiencing what it truly meant to fall into an ice cavern for the first time in her life.

Her face was filled with pity and pleading.

Chen Ping'an tilted his head, listening. "You also have reason to discuss?"

He retracted that action, stood up straight, and then pushed the sword hilt. She stumbled backward, her back pressing against the door.

The tip of the sword immortal had already pierced through the door.

Pinning her firmly against it.

Chen Ping'an, hands tucked in his sleeves, smiled and said, "But did you ask me if I wanted to hear it?"

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 479: The Heart's Barrier Tightens (Part 1)**

Inside the room, the sword energy was sharp and cold, while outside, heavy snow fell in a harsh chill.

The sword immortal, whose blade had pierced through the heart of the charcoal snow and the door, seemed to connect two realms, great and small.

Tan Xue understood that pleading was futile; she fell silent, and both sides were trapped in a long, tense quiet. The man before her, also from Mud Bottle Alley, had shifted from a lengthy exposition of theories to a sudden, lethal strike. Especially after his success, his words resembled a replay of a chess match, leaving her feeling horrified.

Almost every cultivator on Qingxia Island thought that this steward at the mountain gate had a good temper and was easy to converse with.

They were all blind!

She took a gentle breath, only to be met with a wave of pain that pierced her heart. It was an upheaval deep within her soul, more than just her physical body suffering severe injuries. 

All beings fear death; life was the most tangible thing. This was what the man in front of her referred to as "small"—this point Tan Xue actually understood. Earlier, she had merely pretended not to.

When she clearly sensed her life ebbing away, even perceiving the profound Dao dissipating bit by bit, it felt like the world’s stingiest tycoon watching gold ingots drop to the ground, helpless to pick them up. 

Naturally, she began to struggle, seemingly wanting to step out and wrench away her resilient body, equivalent to a pure martial artist at the ninth realm, from the “wall” of the door, leaving the sword immortal behind. 

Then, she would twist the young man’s neck to vent her pent-up rage.

However, she quickly halted her movements. A slight motion sent waves of heart-wrenching pain through her. More importantly, the man who had the upper hand, the steward who liked to take things step by step, not only showed no signs of anxiety, but his smile grew increasingly mocking.

Chen Pingan was unsure if it was because he had consumed four secret elixirs from the Water Palace in one go, or if his use of a semi-immortal weapon was too much of a taboo. His pallid face bore a sickly flush.

Chen Pingan slowly said, “Although I have yet to refine this sword immortal, carrying it for long has allowed the sword energy to seep into my soul, creating a sort of understanding. It’s like a child who hasn’t learned to speak.”

He pointed at the half-sword, “But it made it clear to me that when you begged for mercy just now, you harbored murderous intent, wanting to perish with me, to leave no stone unturned. Now, you’re putting on an act. What’s wrong? Do you feel so shamefully defeated by my schemes that you want to regain some face?”

She could only remain silent.

Her heart was filled with sorrow.

Could it be that she was truly in the wrong? If so, where did she go wrong? 

As if seeing through her thoughts, Chen Pingan continued, “If I say your fault lies in being a descendant of a true dragon, serving as a retainer, and using your exceptionally strong spirit and will to subtly influence Gu Can’s character, then in reality, Liu Zhimo is not Gu Can’s true master. It’s his mother and you—this beast. Because Gu Can trusts you both the most. He’s always wary of Liu Zhimo. Thus, Liu Zhimo’s influence on him is far from negligible.”

Chen Pingan paused, watching her, “Gu Can’s understanding of Shujian Lake and his way of navigating this cesspool has largely been learned from Liu Zhimo in secret. But compared to you two, he’s still far behind. If I say you’re too foolish, believing I’m just another one of Shujian Lake’s people, then you assume you can easily overpower me just because my cultivation isn’t high enough.”

She asked, “What do you really want?”

Chen Pingan replied, “I’m contemplating how you’ll die, and once you do, how to make the best use of your remains.”

She retorted, “I no longer doubt that I might die, but don’t forget, I’m ultimately a Nascent Soul cultivator. You will die too.”

Chen Pingan looked at her, disappointment evident in his gaze.

She began to genuinely try to see things from this man’s perspective, as if for the first time considering him an equal opponent, contemplating his strategies and tactics.

She asked, “I believe you have your means of self-preservation. I hope you can tell me, to make me thoroughly give up. Don’t try to fool me with those two flying swords; I know they aren’t.”

Chen Pingan slowly said, “There’s a ferry named Osmanthus Island at Laolong City. Historically, there was a very influential old boatman who passed down a technique called the Dragon’s Whip, inscribed with the words ‘What to do, what to care,’ as one of the methods for the ferry to safely navigate through the Dragon’s Abyss. I once rode a cross-ocean ferry to that Upside Down Mountain and witnessed it myself. However, the later generations of Osmanthus Island cultivators are unaware that it was actually a spell recorded in an ancient book, specifically designed to counter dragon-like beings. To complete it, the ‘Command of the Rain Master’ must be inscribed, making it a complete talisman. Coincidentally, this talisman, I know how to write. It’s quite powerful. If not for this sword immortal pinning you to the door, I wouldn’t be able to kill you, and it would be challenging just to trap you. But now, dealing with you is more than enough, especially since it took me quite a while on a certain night to ensure the talisman was sufficiently filled with energy.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “Earlier, when I asked you to sit at the table, do you regret not agreeing? Actually, there’s no need for remorse, because your thought process is too simple; I’m well aware of it. But you have no idea about mine. You left Lvzhu Cave Heaven and Mud Bottle Alley earlier than Gu Can, so you don’t know how I killed Cai Jinji of Yunxia Mountain before I even learned to fight, and how I almost killed Fu Nanhua of Laolong City.”

Chen Pingan pointed to his own head, “So you transforming into human form is merely a façade because you lack this.”

The heat from the door panel suddenly registered on Tan Xue’s back, and she woke up in an instant, screaming, “That talisman has been inscribed on the door!”

Chen Pingan raised a finger, signaling her to lower her voice.

Chen Pingan asked with a smile, “Isn’t it strange that you didn’t notice such a powerful talisman’s presence at all?”

Her heart sank into despair.

Chen Pingan answered his own question, “Because the talisman was incomplete, lacking a bit of vital energy. First, the quality of the talisman is quite high; I can write it, but the cost is substantial. Second, if it were complete, you being a Nascent Soul cultivator would be extremely sensitive to the flow of heaven and earth’s energy. Perhaps if you knocked on the door, you wouldn’t have entered the room at all. Don’t you all call me the steward? I thought I shouldn’t let you down for the hospitality of Qingxia Island. Your blood and spirit just happened to fill the last critical aspect of this talisman.”

Chen Pingan asked, “Do you think the name Tan Xue was given to you for nothing? Now, we are the same furnace, but unfortunately, I’m not Gu Can, so I am not close to you.”

As he spoke, Chen Pingan plucked two golden talismans from the nearby objects, “In fact, there are two real ones that are complete. What will you do now? Do you still have the confidence to take me down with you? You said that my secret weapon isn’t the two flying swords. In fact, you were only half right. I have walked alongside them to this day, facing fierce enemies and fighting for our lives more times than you can imagine.”

The two flying swords flew out of the sword-raising gourd, piercing the two talismans’ cores, their spiritual light bursting forth like two warm, radiant coal baskets.

One flying sword hovered at the center of Tan Xue’s forehead, at the Qiezhong acupoint.

The other hovered at the lower dantian, at the Qi Sea.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Don’t mind that last push of the sword; it wasn’t aimed at you but rather to welcome guests. It also serves to show you what it means to make the best use of everything, so you won’t think I’m deceiving you again.”

Chen Pingan stepped forward a few paces, completely ignoring her, who was pinned against the door, gently opened it, and smiled, “I hope the True Monarch hasn’t waited too long.”

It turned out that True Monarch Liu Zhimo had long been standing outside in the snow.

When a revered cultivator deliberately concealed their aura within their own small realm, not even Tan Xue had noticed; logically, Chen Pingan shouldn’t have either. 

When that semi-immortal weapon was drawn again, Liu Zhimo had already sensed it keenly outside the Hengbo Mansion but hesitated, reluctant to take the risk to investigate. 

But when the sword’s tip pierced through the door, Liu Zhimo could no longer hold back. He quietly left the hidden chamber of the mansion and approached the mountain gate of Qingxia Island. 

Liu Zhimo had stood outside the door for quite a while.

Chen Pingan stepped aside, “You may sit inside, True Monarch.”

Liu Zhimo sighed inwardly, wearing a smile as he strode in, bypassing the blue stone slab and taking a seat at the table. 

Chen Pingan closed the door again. Though the actions of opening and closing the door were not grand, Tan Xue, impaled by a sword immortal, felt as though she had fallen into an ice cavern, and then with the talisman inscribed on the door suppressing her, it was like being thrown into a boiling pot of oil. It was both a double blow and a fuel to the fire, making her wish for nothing more than to die.

Chen Pingan sat across from Liu Zhimo once more.

Liu Zhimo took out the white bowl again, placing it on the table and gently pushing it, clearly asking for wine again, “Only with a guest like Mr. Chen can I be a host like this; it’s a blessing in life.”

Chen Pingan waved his hand, summoning the sword-raising gourd into his palm to pour Liu Zhimo a bowl of wine. This time, it was far more generous than the first, filling the bowl to the brim with the celestial black crow wine. However, he didn’t push it back immediately, asking, “Have you thought it through? Or have you already discussed it with the island master Tan Yuanyi of Lizi Island?”

Liu Zhimo smiled and countered, “Could it be that Mr. Chen can’t guess whether Tan Yuanyi’s trip to Gongliu Island was successful or not?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “I’m not a fortune-telling immortal; I can’t guess.”

Liu Zhimo sighed, “If Mr. Chen had been to Lizi Island and met Island Master Tan Yuanyi a few times by the Wulong Pond, perhaps you could follow the clues to find the answer. You are skilled in reasoning, truly proficient in this.”

Chen Pingan still shook his head, “What’s so profound about that? You haven’t seen the true demeanor of a great master. I’ll speak plainly; True Monarch, don’t take offense.”

Liu Zhimo took a deep breath, saying, “To be honest, although Tan Yuanyi is the manager of the Green Wave Pavilion of the Great Li in the entire central region of Baopingzhou, after going to the island to have a private discussion with Liu Lao Cheng, things didn’t go too well. At that time, Tan Yuanyi offered a condition of one false and one real.”

Liu Zhimo paused for a moment, noticing that Chen Pingan was still quietly waiting for him to continue, feeling somewhat wistful. In truth, just based on the phrase "one false and one real," Chen Pingan could grasp the rough truth. Yet he wouldn’t say a single word; he was willing to wait, willing to endure and be patient. 

Only someone with sufficient cultivation and temperament, like Liu Zhimo, could understand this subtlety of character.

Liu Zhimo continued, “Great Li hopes that I can maintain the false identity of a river and lake monarch while handing over all the real benefits to Gongliu Island. With over a thousand islands in Shujian Lake, as the nominal leader of the Shujian Lake alliance, I can only choose a few of the more than thirty islands outside of the ten or so vassal islands, forming a land similar to a secular dynasty, while all other islands fall under the jurisdiction of Gongliu Island. Of course, the Song family of the Great Li will inevitably want to draw dividends from Liu Lao Cheng in the coming years. Then, under this premise, Liu Lao Cheng must not take any actions against me or Qingxia Island, either openly or secretly. However, Tan Yuanyi will probably try to phrase this request as politely as possible to Liu Lao Cheng.”

Liu Zhimo sighed, “Even after such concessions, Liu Lao Cheng is still unwilling to agree. He even refused to grant me the title of river and lake monarch, leaving a remark for Tan Yuanyi that there won’t be any river and lake monarchs in Shujian Lake in the future. It’s simply ridiculous.”

Chen Pingan frowned.

He couldn’t think of the intricacies involved for the moment.

Because he had no idea about the schemes of Xun Yuan from Yuguizong regarding the location selection for the new sect at Shujian Lake, nor the alliance between Xun Yuan and Liu Lao Cheng, nor could he guess that Jiang Shangzhen, who held the Yunkong Blessing, would soon become the first master of the new sect.

As the new sect of Yuguizong, it certainly aimed to encompass the entire Shujian Lake, and perhaps even include the provinces around Shujian Lake, such as Shihai Kingdom.

Who would allow others to sleep soundly beside their own bed? A Nascent Soul rogue cultivator like Liu Zhimo was hardly anything of note.

But Liu Zhimo did not know, and neither did Tan Yuanyi.

National Master Cui Zhan had, intentionally or otherwise, concealed information from Tan Yuanyi regarding this game, aiming to make Cui Dongshan lose convincingly, allowing the two to be differentiated in status and ensuring that Cui Dongshan would willingly leave the Shanchui Academy to serve him, assisting him and the Great Li cavalry in stabilizing half of Baopingzhou. As for whether it was in the north or south, whether to guard the Jiangshan north of Guanhushi Academy or to conquer the territory in the south, Cui Zhan had given Cui Dongshan the choice; both options were viable.

For someone like Cui Zhan, human affairs were all untrustworthy, but could he even not trust “himself”? Wouldn’t that be questioning his own Dao? Just as Chen Pingan in his innermost heart rejected becoming one of the mountain dwellers, so he couldn't even step onto that bridge built for crossing the river.

Although now divided into two, Cui Dongshan was only half of Cui Zhan, but both Cui Zhan and Cui Dongshan were not merely individuals who would only rely on cunning and small tricks.

Once they truly decided to sit down and play a game, they would be willing to accept the outcome, especially when losing to half of themselves.

Once Cui Dongshan emerged from the mountain, he would wholeheartedly assist the Great Li.

Without a doubt, this would equate to the Great Li dynasty gaining an additional embroidered tiger out of thin air!

At that time, Cui Zhan had yet to leave the high tower of Chi Shui City, using Cui Dongshan’s own half-true and half-false joke to say, “Even I find it terrifying to think about; how can the Great Li possibly lose in Baopingzhou?”

Chen Pingan fell into silence. This news was a mixed bag.

The good was that Liu Zhimo’s bargaining power had plummeted. With Liu Lao Cheng sitting firmly on Gongliu Island, the weight of the things Liu Zhimo and Chen Pingan were negotiating would become lighter and lighter.

The bad was that this meant that to achieve what he wanted, Chen Pingan would need to offer more to the Great Li. He even began to doubt whether Tan Yuanyi of Lizi Island was qualified to influence the strategies at the heart of the Great Li, and whether he could negotiate as the representative of the Song family in Shujian Lake with himself. If Tan Yuanyi’s voice wasn’t loud enough, the energy Chen Pingan spent on him would be in vain. He feared even more that Tan Yuanyi might be promoted elsewhere in the Great Li, leading to a new spokesperson in Shujian Lake, ruining the little “bond” he had established with Tan Yuanyi. Most concerning was if Tan Yuanyi were intercepted by Liu Lao Cheng, leading to changes in the situation of Shujian Lake. It should be noted that the final ownership of Shujian Lake was never meant to be decided by any Lizi Island, but rather by the Great Li cavalry stationed at the borders of the Zhuying Dynasty. Their unstoppable force determined the fate of the lake itself. 

Once Tan Yuanyi was deemed unfit by the Great Li’s prominent families, Chen Pingan wouldn’t even need to go to Lizi Island, for Tan Yuanyi would be in dire straits, perhaps even viewing him as a lifeline, gripping onto him for dear life, hoping for this to be their last resort for survival. At that point, Tan Yuanyi, a celestial cultivator capable of determining the fates of the two large islands of Qingzong and Tianmo overnight, would become even more terrifying and ruthless.

The truth was simple.

Tan Xue would be pinned to the door by Chen Pingan at this moment.

Chen Pingan was equally likely to become the next Tan Xue.

This was the true meaning of wandering the realms—life and death were one’s own responsibility.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 480: The Heart's Barrier Tightens (Part 2)

Liu Zhimiao patiently waited for Chen Ping'an to speak, refraining from interrupting the account manager's contemplation.

Chen Ping'an's first sentence broke the silence, “Please ask the True Monarch to summon Tan Yuanyi to Qingxia Island for a private discussion with me. The sooner, the better.”

Liu Zhimiao let out a silent sigh of relief.

However, what followed from Chen Ping'an's mouth made Liu Zhimiao's heart race with anxiety and difficulty.

“We both know that Tan Yuanyi has hit a wall on Gongliu Island. Liu Laocheng is certainly not asking for an outrageous price; he won’t give you any chance to pay him back on the spot. Right now, Tan Yuanyi himself is stuck on Grains Island, a veritable quagmire—one misstep and he’ll be covered in muck. Therefore, I have two conditions. First, you must lift the secret restriction on Gu Can’s mother. No need to ask if I’ll doubt your promise; we are both aware of each other’s bottom lines, so there’s no need for pointless testing. You know very well how I currently view the Chunting Residence.”

“Second, you must relinquish control over Hongsu of the Zhuxian Residence and hand it over to me. If Tan Yuanyi proves ineffective, I’ll go personally to negotiate with Liu Laocheng.”

Chen Ping'an's voice hardened, “The second condition isn’t even a proper condition, Liu Zhimiao; you should consider this carefully! As long as the green hills remain, there’s no need to worry about firewood. This is not only the rule of Shujian Lake but also a universal truth for all rogue cultivators in the world.”

Without hesitation, Liu Zhimiao replied, “Agreed!”

Chen Ping'an seemed a bit surprised.

Liu Zhimiao opened one hand.

Chen Ping'an smiled slightly and pushed a white bowl filled with wine towards Liu Zhimiao. Liu Zhimiao raised the bowl and took a sip. “Mr. Chen, you are my only confidant here in Shujian Lake, so naturally, I must show some sincerity.”

Liu Zhimiao glanced at the small loach and then turned his gaze back, tapping his finger on his own head. “I have this thing.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Your confidant? How do you insult people?”

Liu Zhimiao was unbothered and burst into hearty laughter. “See? You’re saying we’re not confidants?”

The seemingly dying Charcoal Snow slightly twisted her neck, watching the two men who were engaging in lively conversation, listening to their words, which could very well determine the fate of Shujian Lake.

At that moment, she began to grasp the implications behind Chen Ping'an's words.

Innuendo, she had as well, such as when Chen Ping'an had exposed her, revealing that she was still naive and ignorant over on Mud Bottle Alley, and thus all reasons and sins, even when she arrived at Shujian Lake, were merely “recorded” lightly. Therefore, the Chunting Residence's current “rise to prominence” had little to do with her; it was all due to that mother-daughter pair.

However, compared to Chen Ping'an’s insinuations, it was only when Liu Zhimiao entered, sat down, and being the master of Qingxia Island, needed to await Chen Ping'an's approval to even drink a bowl of wine, that she finally understood. Liu Zhimiao, a seasoned Nascent Soul cultivator whom even she feared, actually referred to that young man, who was yet to reach twenty, as a “confidant.”

She truly admitted the fact that she was not clever enough in front of Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an pointed at Charcoal Snow and said to Liu Zhimiao, “The National Master of Dali would appreciate this piece of Nascent Soul dragon shedding. I just acquired it as a bargaining chip. It can ensure your life, Liu Zhimiao. If worse comes to worst, it can help you secure a Dali peace token, allowing you to evade and relocate from Shujian Lake, with a future as a Dali worshiper, at least there’s hope. So even if there’s no agreement between Grains Island and Liu Laocheng, I can still help you prevent that worst-case scenario from happening.”

Liu Zhimiao grinned, “Mr. Chen is really willing to part with this beast?”

Chen Ping'an took a sip from his wine gourd and pointed at Charcoal Snow. “I’ve given her many chances. If she had seized just one, she wouldn’t have ended up like this. Who can she blame? Blame me for not having enough compassion? To put it a mile further, I’m certainly no bodhisattva.”

Liu Zhimiao nodded lightly, in deep agreement.

If the young man before him didn’t possess this level of wit and mentality, he wouldn’t be worthy of sitting down and shamelessly asking for a bowl of wine.

When he first came here, why didn’t Liu Zhimiao nod immediately? 

On one hand, he clung to hope that Tan Yuanyi could negotiate a resolution with Liu Laocheng, in which case Liu Zhimiao wouldn’t need to engage with Chen Ping'an at all—like water in wells, each minding their own business.

On the other hand, Chen Ping'an's understanding of many matters, such as Hongsu and the secret restrictions on the women of the Chunting Residence, wouldn’t genuinely make Liu Zhimiao feel “reassured.” Why do scholars say that all are of lower worth, yet only reading is high? In the end, wouldn’t they just be slapping their own faces, saying that scholars are of no use at all? Isn’t how one thinks one thing, and how one acts another?

Thus, how Chen Ping'an handled that ambitious yet fragile creature was an invisible threshold. If he crossed it and did well, decisively and beautifully, then Liu Zhimiao would dare to truly engage in dealings and trades with Chen Ping'an.

There must be fighting and killing, that’s a given.

How to fight and kill is an art.

That loach and Gu Can’s actions, along with those of Lü Caizang and Yuan Yuan—these so-called young prodigies in Liu Zhimiao’s eyes—were merely children playing house. They spoke loudly, broke more porcelain and earthenware, yet genuinely believed that Heaven was first and they were second. But Liu Zhimiao didn’t consider this a bad thing; rather, it was the best. The more naive fools were obsessed with the so-called strength of their fists, not realizing how much the support of islands and ancestral powers they relied on was misconstrued. Was it worth his concern? Liu Zhimiao's own chair would only sit more steadily beneath him.

Unfortunately, Liu Laocheng, a more seasoned figure, had arrived.

With Liu Zhimiao existing, how could Liu Laocheng not? 

Time wasn’t on his side, and Liu Zhimiao could only lament like this.

The reason he had to lower himself before this young junior was due to the pressure of circumstances. It wasn’t just the jade token, the Dali Iron Cavalry, or the shifting fortunes of Central Bao Pingzhou.

However, the biggest difference between Chen Ping'an and others lay in his profound awareness of these matters, and every word and action seemed to adhere to a set of rules that even Liu Zhimiao found exceedingly strange...

And as these rules—crafted through each remark and small act—gradually became apparent, Liu Zhimiao was willing to be convinced.

Suddenly, Liu Zhimiao chuckled, saying something utterly shocking, “Mr. Chen, are you not discussing 'Observing the Dao' and 'Merging with the Dao'?”

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine, as if joking, “So the True Monarch is indeed a confidant.”

Liu Zhimiao solemnly lowered his wine bowl and clasped his fists in return. “You and I follow different paths to the Great Dao, and we were once mutual enemies. However, for Mr. Chen to act as a lower realm immortal with a cultivation level of five stages, that alone deserves my respect.”

Chen Ping'an teased, “If the True Monarch could share some insights about your life’s trajectory and help me observe the Dao further, I would be immensely grateful.”

Liu Zhimiao hurriedly waved his hand, “Confidants do not distinguish between enemies and friends; at present, we are at most not enemies, and at least temporarily so. If conflicts arise in the future, we’ll merely rely on our own abilities. Since we’re not friends, why should I help Mr. Chen? If I recall correctly, Mr. Chen owes quite a bit of divine money in our Qingxia Island’s secret treasury. If Mr. Chen is willing to offer a jade token as a gift, or even just lend it to me for a century, I would be most generous and straightforward, answering whatever questions you ask. Even if you don’t ask, I would still spill everything, no matter what should or shouldn’t be said.”

The former owner of that jade token was one of the seventy-two sages of the Middle Earth Confucian Temple, a great saint overseeing the skies of the Bao Pingzhou territory.

Liu Zhimiao was, of course, aware of the weight of this matter.

Both wary and envious.

As for whether he could take over, it was simple—it all depended on whether Chen Ping'an dared to extend it.

Because Liu Zhimiao didn’t truly understand the real rules above the Confucian sect, while Chen Ping'an knew much more.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “You can forget about that.”

Liu Zhimiao had no hopes to begin with, so he naturally wouldn’t be disappointed.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “If I were to hold the jade token and indiscriminately draw the spiritual energy from Shujian Lake, fishing it all into my own pocket, would you, True Monarch, or he, Liu Laocheng, or the hidden Dali Song family, dare to obstruct me? Would you?”

Liu Zhimiao’s expression stiffened.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Rest assured, this is reasonable, but not polite. So even if you dare not stop me, I wouldn’t do it. Of course, if it’s absolutely necessary, I’ll try to see if I can leap right into the Earth Immortal realm.”

Liu Zhimiao clasped his fists again, “I implore Mr. Chen not to engage in mutual destruction. Attacking the foundation of Shujian Lake would also leave you completely devoid of this protective talisman.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I stand behind. Shujian Lake stands before. The sequence cannot be disturbed.”

Chen Ping'an stood up, “Come, True Monarch, accompany me to the Chunting Residence. Let’s have a meal of winter dumplings from our hometown.”

Liu Zhimiao followed suit, casting a glance at the pitiful little loach.

One half-immortal weapon, two personal flying swords, and three binding talismans.

All excellent resources from our Shujian Lake.

Truly remarkable.

Chen Ping'an didn’t even look at her. “On the way, please tell me about the shedding method of the dragon scales. When I return, I’ll listen to her last words. Who knows? Perhaps her reasoning might convince me?”

Liu Zhimiao laughed heartily.

The two men left the room.

Upon arriving at the Chunting Residence, Gu Can appeared pale, and the woman couldn’t hide her anxiety.

Chen Ping'an merely stated, “Charcoal Snow is with me. She wants to discuss her reasoning, so she won’t be joining us for dumplings.”

After finishing a bowl of dumplings, Chen Ping'an set down his chopsticks, stating he was full, and thanked the woman. 

Liu Zhimiao also put down his chopsticks, standing side by side, leaving together.

The two parted ways.

Liu Zhimiao returned to Hengbo Residence first, then quietly went back to Chunting Residence.

Chen Ping'an, on the other hand, returned to his room alone.

On a snowy night, the returnees were few.

The sword tip of the sword immortal remained at the door.

Chen Ping'an opened the door and entered the room. Charcoal Snow spoke the first words, “I don’t want to die.”

After Chen Ping'an closed the door, he replied, “Is this your reasoning?”

Chen Ping'an ignored her further, lighting two lamps on the desk and moving out the “Underworld” Yama Hall, placing it on the table.

He continued with what he had been doing for the past half month.

She remained pinned to the doorway.

By the late hours of the night, after a tiring round of drinking to invigorate himself, Chen Ping'an put away the wooden pavilion and returned it to the bamboo box.

Holding the charcoal cage, he walked to the window, gazing out at Shujian Lake, where the heavy snow had finally ceased.

Chen Ping'an looked at the desolate scene of snow blanketing the mountains on an island and softly said, “In the four-page ledger, thirty-two individuals, yet not one ghostly spirit dares to speak up, asking me to kill you for revenge. Thus, I believe you deserve to die, and I plan to change my mind and prepare to avoid dealings with the Dali National Master. Over at the Chunting Residence, after I finish a large bowl of dumplings, no one will plead for your case. Just as you said, my golden literary brush shattered on its own; Gu Can wouldn’t dare ask, and tonight is no different—still, she wouldn’t dare. Right now, Liu Zhimiao should be at the Chunting Residence, helping Gu Can’s mother lift the restrictions, most likely viewed as a top benefactor in her eyes. As for me, from this night onward, I’ll probably become Chunting Residence's ungrateful enemy.”

Holding the charcoal cage in one hand, Chen Ping'an walked to her side and grasped the sword immortal’s hilt.

Her face was filled with tears, and her resolve was on the brink of collapse, repeatedly murmuring, “Chen Ping'an, I know I was wrong. I truly know I was wrong.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “You only know you’re about to die.”

On this snowy night, another visitor arrived.

A young man in a dark green python robe hurried over, kneeling in the snow outside the door.

Chen Ping'an unsheathed his sword, cleaving her in two.

The golden sword tip of the sword immortal, after sliding a distance, still remained sheathed in the hand of the wielder.

Then the door was pushed open.

Chen Ping'an stood at the entrance, “Gu Can, I thought you would say that if Charcoal Snow dies, you would also self-destruct before my eyes. Before I opened the door, I was still pondering whether this was your own idea or the phrasing your mother taught you.”

Gu Can raised her head, crying silently.

This was the first time in the years since leaving home that she cried, returning to the state of that little snot-nosed kid from Mud Bottle Alley.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 481: Heart as Still as Water

Chen Ping'an gazed up at the night sky, his eyes lingering for a long time without looking away. He stood beneath the eaves, holding a charcoal basket in his hand. 

Gu Can cried out heart-wrenchingly, like a wounded cub. Even after Chen Ping'an turned his gaze back to her, he remained silent, allowing Gu Can to wail in despair, her face streaked with tears and snot. 

Gu Can continued to cry until her body began to tremble, her strength fading, and she started to sob softly. Gathering some energy, she began to howl again, as if crying had drained all the spirit from her being.

Chen Ping'an finally broke the silence, asking slowly, “Why didn’t you plead for mercy with me? Is it because you know it would be useless? You don’t want to lose your last chance? After speaking up for Tan Xue, I’ve severed ties not only with the Spring Courtyard but also with your mother. The last thread of connection between us is gone, isn’t it? Have you finally realized that even with Tan Xue around, she might not survive in Shujian Lake? If I, Chen Ping'an, were to become your Spring Courtyard’s guardian spirit, perhaps both of you could continue to live as you did before, albeit with a bit less ease—unable to boldly tell me, ‘I just enjoy killing’? But tell me, would you prefer that one day, out of the blue, a cultivator you’ve never met strikes you down without reason, while your family gathers underground in harmony? Which would be better?”

Gu Can remained silent, her eyes fixed on Chen Ping'an without wiping away the tears and snot on her face. 

With a sigh, Chen Ping'an stepped closer to her, bending down to offer the charcoal basket in his hand. The crunch of snow beneath his feet filled the air with a squeaky sound. 

Gu Can did not reach out to take it. 

Chen Ping'an squatted down, looking directly into her eyes. “Little snot bug, it’s okay. Just speak your mind; I’m listening.” 

Gu Can grabbed a handful of snow and turned away, smearing it on her face. Then she turned back, choking on her words as she said, “Chen Ping'an, you’re the worst person!” 

Chen Ping'an burst out laughing, taken aback for a moment. “In Shujian Lake, I’m actually a good person. It’s not that good people are clever; it’s just that bad people are foolish.” 

Gu Can’s tears spilled over, flooding her cheeks. “Your Shujian Lake, your Spring Courtyard, you and your mother! Chen Ping'an, you love saying these things. Let’s not do this, okay...” 

She covered her face with her hands, sobbing quietly. 

“Just go back,” Chen Ping'an said. 

Gu Can punched him in the chest, sending him tumbling into the snow. She stood up and staggered away. 

After running a dozen steps, she stopped but did not turn around. With a sniffle, she said, “Chen Ping'an, you have always been more important than that little loach. But from now on, that’s not the case. Even if the little loach dies, it’s still better than you.” 

Chen Ping'an sat in the snow, gazing toward Shujian Lake. 

His heart was as still as water. 

Standing up, he shook off the snowflakes clinging to his cotton coat and walked toward the ferry pier, waiting for Tan Yuanyi of Grain Island to arrive. With Liu Zhimiao’s decisive style, once he returned to Hengbo Manor, he would surely send a sword message to Grain Island. However, Chen Ping'an suddenly considered that this spy leader from the Green Wave Pavilion in the central part of Baoping Continent likely wouldn’t come by boat. Instead, he probably communicated secretly with Liu Zhimiao and snuck into Qingxia Island. So, Chen Ping'an turned and headed straight for Hengbo Manor.

---

**Spring Courtyard.**

A woman draped in a snow-white fox fur coat waited anxiously. 

Seeing Gu Can’s silhouette, she hurried over, asking, “What happened? Where’s Tan Xue? Didn’t she come back with you?” 

Earlier, while they had been wrapping dumplings together in the kitchen, Gu Can had suddenly changed drastically, collapsing to the floor, clutching her chest as if she had fallen gravely ill. 

The woman had sensed that something was wrong; it was likely that something had happened to Tan Xue outside the Spring Courtyard. 

Gu Can looked up, dazed. “She’s dead.” 

The woman was taken aback, thinking she misheard. “Can-can, what did you say?” 

Gu Can repeated, “She’s dead.” 

The woman’s face turned serious. “Dead? Just like that? Tan Xue is a Jindan (Golden Core) realm dragon; how could she possibly die?! Aside from that old bastard Liu from Gongliu Island, who else in Shujian Lake could kill Tan Xue?!” 

Gu Can stared at her mother’s face and said, “There’s also Chen Ping'an.” 

The woman shouted angrily, “What nonsense are you talking? How could Chen Ping'an kill Tan Xue? What right does he have to kill something that doesn’t even belong to him anymore? Is he crazy? That ungrateful little brat should have starved to death back in Mud Bottle Alley! I knew he had bad intentions coming to our Qingxia Island; that scoundrel...” 

Gu Can suddenly said, “Chen Ping'an might be listening.” 

The woman immediately shut her mouth, glancing around nervously, her face pale, blending in with the snow on the ground and her fox fur.

Gu Can fell into a heavy silence.

The woman suddenly embraced her, crying, “Oh, my poor child.” 

Gu Can’s expression was blank. He felt weak in both body and spirit. After moving back and forth between the Spring Courtyard and the mountain gate in the snow, he was already feeling cold to the bone. 

Upon returning to Hengbo Manor, Liu Zhimiao hesitated for a moment before sending his trusted housekeeper to invite Zhang Ye. 

He then went to a secret sword mound resembling a sword house, where he kept a high-grade communication sword, carefully considering his words before sending a message to the lord of Grain Island, Tan Yuanyi. 

Finally, Liu Zhimiao entered a grand hall decorated with a rug made from the specialty fabric of the Colorful Garment Kingdom. With a sweep of his hand, he conjured a mist that settled into a scene of the mountain gate of Qingxia Island. 

The heavy snow had stopped, making the scene appear eerily quiet. 

Liu Zhimiao lowered his head, staring at the image formed by the mist. 

He glanced outside several times during this period. 

Liu Zhimiao smiled wryly; among nearly a thousand cultivators on Qingxia Island, only Zhang Ye dared to heed the orders of Hengbo Manor, still ambling along without a care, never in a hurry to use wind techniques. As for whether he, the island lord, would harbor any resentment, Zhang Ye never cared. 

Liu Zhimiao sighed. 

Most of the old brothers who once fought side by side had met their end, either dying on the battlefield expanding their territory, falling victim to endless ambushes and assassinations, or being killed by Liu Zhimiao himself due to rebellious intentions. There were, of course, more who died of old age, leaving only Zhang Ye, the last old comrade of Qingxia Island. 

Liu Zhimiao walked through the misty painting to the entrance, hesitating briefly before stepping outside to wait for Zhang Ye. 

As a Dragon Gate realm cultivator below the Earth Immortal level, Zhang Ye could easily rule over one of the thousands of islands in Shujian Lake. Even without discussing his friendship with Liu Zhimiao, he was more than capable of being an island lord. In fact, after Liu Zhimiao’s recent conquests of more than ten large islands, including Su Lin Island, he intended to offer Zhang Ye the option to choose a large island as his base of operations. However, after refusing twice, Liu Zhimiao no longer insisted. 

In the early days of their meeting as fellow cultivators at the Ocean Viewing level, Zhang Ye, born of a pedigree of immortal teachers, was not only Liu Zhimiao’s friend but also his strategist behind the scenes. It could be said that Zhang Ye’s astute counsel was crucial in helping Qingxia Island weather many storms in its early days. 

Liu Zhimiao had always treated Zhang Ye with great respect, not only because of their hard-won bond during difficult times but also because after Zhang Ye had established himself on Qingxia Island, Liu Zhimiao had risen rapidly in his cultivation journey, leaving Zhang Ye far behind. Zhang Ye never hesitated to share his thoughts, often reminding Liu Zhimiao of his responsibilities. Liu Zhimiao had been genuinely annoyed with Zhang Ye for not considering his face, especially after stepping into the Golden Core realm, leading to a gradual distancing between them. Zhang Ye was mostly left to manage the fishing and treasury departments, acting in the capacity of a local official while holding the rank of a capital official. His unpopularity was evident, and over the years, it was hard to determine whether his situation had become dire. However, compared to the later generations of Qingxia Island who worshipped Yu Huai, Zhang Ye had increasingly fewer opportunities to appear publicly. He would attend many celebrations but never spoke, neither flattering the True Monarch of the River Crossing nor dampening spirits. 

As memories flashed through Liu Zhimiao's mind, he felt an unexpected pang of nostalgia. 

Finally, Zhang Ye arrived. 

Upon seeing Liu Zhimiao, he continued to walk at a leisurely pace. 

Not only that, but he was also holding a solid snowball, revealing just how relaxed he had been on his way over, while the person sent to summon him had been in a frenzy. 

The housekeeper from Hengbo Manor, also a Dragon Gate realm cultivator, had been anxious during the trip to find Zhang Ye. Yet, upon seeing the True Monarch waiting at the door, he felt a jolt of regret. He had urged Zhang Ye too many times, but thankfully, he hadn’t complained; otherwise, he would likely have faced consequences. 

Liu Zhimiao waved to the housekeeper, signaling him not to approach the hall, and the latter promptly bowed and left. 

Zhang Ye clasped his fist in greeting. “I greet the island lord.” 

Liu Zhimiao smiled and waved his hand dismissively, signaling Zhang Ye not to stand on ceremony. 

The two of them stepped over the threshold, and Zhang Ye looked at the painting floating above the beautifully woven rug, remaining silent. 

Liu Zhimiao got straight to the point, “Back then, it took you and the fishing department eight years to help me find the reincarnation of that Jindan female cultivator. You advised me to keep her at Qingxia Island but warned me never to harm her. When Liu Lao Cheng returned to Gongliu Island, if things turned sour, I could use this as leverage to save my life. At the time, I didn’t believe you, and we argued. I even said you were being overly sentimental, that your understanding of Liu Lao Cheng’s nature was laughable. It seems you weren’t entirely wrong, but I was definitely mistaken.” 

Zhang Ye’s expression remained unchanged. “It’s rare for the island lord to admit a mistake. I wonder if the sun will rise from the west tomorrow morning.” 

Liu Zhimiao reached out and poked Zhang Ye on the shoulder, chuckling, “With that attitude and mouth of yours, if you were anyone else, I would have killed you ten times over.” 

Zhang Ye replied nonchalantly, “Then I thank the island lord for sparing my life.” 

Just as Liu Zhimiao was about to speak, he suddenly pointed at the painting, saying, “Look closely.” 

In the painting, Gu Can was kneeling in the snow outside the door. 

When the steward opened the door and finished speaking, he raised his head, holding the charcoal basket, looking up. 

Liu Zhimiao’s expression flickered between dark and light. 

Zhang Ye suggested, “I advise the island lord to withdraw. However, I reckon it might be pointless.” 

Liu Zhimiao extended a finger and lightly tapped a spot on the painting before sweeping his sleeve, truly dismissing the image. 

Liu Zhimiao asked, “What do you think about this Chen Ping'an?” 

Zhang Ye pondered for a moment. “He’s quite frightening. If he were just a rogue cultivator in Shujian Lake, it wouldn’t concern the island lord.” 

Liu Zhimiao nodded. “There are some secrets between him and me that I won’t share with you. It’s not that I don’t trust you; it’s just that you not knowing might be better. However, I can share some trivial matters for amusement.” 

Zhang Ye ceased to intentionally provoke Liu Zhimiao with words. 

The trivial matters Liu Zhimiao mentioned were certainly not trivial at all. 

He then recounted his conversation with Chen Ping'an after leaving the mountain gate and how they had shared a meal of dumplings at the Spring Courtyard before parting ways to pursue their respective paths. 

Liu Zhimiao remarked, “Why do you think Chen Ping'an deliberately included me to intimidate that woman, granting me such a huge favor while ensuring the truth remained hidden from her, allowing me to play the good guy?” 

Zhang Ye contemplated for a moment and replied succinctly, “It’s not complicated. From the moment Chen Ping'an moved out of the Spring Courtyard, he was drawing a line with Gu Can’s mother. His approach was rather gentle, allowing both sides to save face and avoid a complete falling out. At that time, her mother likely felt a sense of relief, unaware of Chen Ping'an’s intentions. Afterwards, he would occasionally dine at the Spring Courtyard to soothe her, gradually easing her worries. She believed she was in the most ‘comfortable’ state of mind, thinking Chen Ping'an wouldn’t deceive Gu Can into going down a dangerous path. Plus, with Chen Ping'an remaining on Qingxia Island, it served as a protective charm for the Spring Courtyard, much like having a guardian spirit at the door, which she naturally appreciated. Following that, Chen Ping'an started visiting the Spring Courtyard less frequently and discreetly, as he was genuinely quite busy. Thus her happiness only grew until tonight, when Chen Ping'an brought the island lord and they sat at the Spring Courtyard table eating dumplings, she finally realized that they had become strangers.” 

After sharing what was nearly the truth, Zhang Ye asked, “As an outsider, I’ve only been observant of Chen Ping'an, and I can see through it. Why ask? Are you afraid I’ve been sitting idle for so long that my mind has rusted like Gu Can’s mother, who likes to think of herself as a noble lady? Besides, even if my mind isn’t sharp, managing the treasury and fishing departments for the island lord is still manageable. Are you worried I might take the treasury and flee if I see Qingxia Island fall apart?” 

Liu Zhimiao laughed and scolded, “Stop talking nonsense!” 

Zhang Ye replied slowly, “But what is the motive? It’s not that I, Zhang Ye, look down on myself. Given the current situation, I truly can’t be of much help. If you want me to be a dead man, I won’t agree, even though I know my days are numbered. But I still have a good sixty years left, which should be enough for an ordinary person. Over the years, I’ve enjoyed my blessings and endured my share of suffering; I owe you and Qingxia Island nothing.” 

Liu Zhimiao didn’t respond to Zhang Ye’s question, feeling an unprompted sense of lament. “If everyone in Shujian Lake were like Chen Ping'an, how could we old-timers survive? How could we thrive?” 

Zhang Ye chuckled, “Island lord, there aren’t many people like that.” 

Liu Zhimiao turned to look at the decaying spirit of this old Dragon Gate realm cultivator, staring for a long while. 

Zhang Ye kept silent. 

Liu Zhimiao said, “Zhang Ye, choose a good day and quietly leave Shujian Lake by the end of this year, don’t wait until spring. Go far away, find a beautiful place, and live out your last years peacefully.” 

Zhang Ye frowned, confused. “Has the situation deteriorated to this extent?” 

Liu Zhimiao hesitated for a moment before speaking honestly. “In the current view, it’s not the worst. However, the world is unpredictable. The Song family from the Great Li Dynasty is bound to take control of Shujian Lake. If one day they decide to take back what they feel they’ve given too much to Liu Lao Cheng, Qingxia Island could face repercussions. At that point, the Great Li could easily find a reason to eliminate me. They’d gain public favor and the assets of more than a dozen islands. If I were in their position, I’d definitely act on it; they might even be sharpening their knives right now.” 

Liu Zhimiao patted Zhang Ye on the shoulder, “It’s not a matter of buying loyalty. If you weren’t Zhang Ye, just some mediocre Dragon Gate realm cultivator, I wouldn’t need to be so long-winded. With that time, I could just focus on my cultivation. Who knows, I might accidentally reach the Yu Pu realm, and then the Great Li wouldn’t dare to sharpen their knives anymore. As a mere half-step away from the Golden Core realm, I’m at a complete disadvantage compared to Ruan Qiong, who has almost been elevated to the heavens by the Song family. The difference between us is infuriating.” 

“Speaking of which, how to buy loyalty, you taught me that back in the day.” 

Liu Zhimiao withdrew his hand from Zhang Ye’s shoulder and straightened his collar, smiling. “I hope to have at least one old comrade by my side who can have a peaceful ending. It’s just a small favor; don’t thank me, or it’ll seem distant.” 

Zhang Ye suddenly began to curse loudly, “You old bastard, if there ever comes a day when the Great Li or Liu Lao Cheng actually kills me, and I’ve hidden away, sixty years later, how will I catch up to you on the road to the underworld to talk?” 

Zhang Ye shook his head softly. “I won’t leave.” 

Liu Zhimiao looked at the stubborn man and casually remarked, “You actually managed to befriend our accountant; sometimes he’s clever to the point of not seeming like a good person, and other times acts like a complete fool.” 

Zhang Ye replied, “Your current mindset isn’t quite right; it's not conducive to cultivation. Going a hundred miles is only half the journey; if you fall at this point, it will be hard to rise again in this lifetime. How will you ever reach the fifth realm? You’ve endured so many storms; don’t you see how many opponents have died in our hands just from a single breath?” 

Liu Zhimiao exclaimed, “Zhang Ye, quite impressive! You’re starting to lecture me again, daring to talk about cultivation as if we’re still those brash Ocean Viewing cultivators from back in the day?” 

Zhang Ye smiled, “When I ascended to the Cave Dwelling realm, I could be considered brash. But you, Liu Zhimiao, were already no spring chicken back then. It’s no wonder; you wild cultivators from the mountains have it much rougher than we pedigree immortal teachers.” 

Liu Zhimiao mocked, “After being a wild cultivator in Shujian Lake for so many years, you still wish to consider yourself an immortal teacher?” 

Zhang Ye murmured, “There’s something I’ve never told anyone; from the day I followed that fellow named Liu Zhimiao to Shujian Lake, I’ve longed to see the day when he, as a wild cultivator, establishes a sect in Shujian Lake. So over the years, I’ve often wandered to a place that was our earliest foothold in Shujian Lake, a small island named Hengbo Island, about the size of a palm. Later, it was destroyed by a Jindan enemy using a natal treasure, which infuriated me. I remember rowing over there alone, silently weeping, both from grief and bitterness.”
