 ### Chapter 771: The Old Academy

As the scorching summer approached, the old locust tree that once provided a cool shade had vanished. The iron well had been sealed off by private owners, leaving the elderly unable to quench their thirst with the sweet well water they cherished. The divine grave was quieter without the chirping of crickets, and the old porcelain mountain, which creaked underfoot, was no longer accessible. Fortunately, the peach blossoms in Peach Leaf Alley still bloomed in vibrant shades of deep and light red.

Life is marked by gatherings and partings, yet there is comfort in both.

At the old academy today, many returnees who had left home were gathering once more.

Li Huai, Lin Shouyi, Dong Shuijing, and Shi Chunjia had arranged to visit the academy together before heading back to the college. There was little to discuss; they simply wanted to take a look around and sit for a while.

Dong Shuijing had asked someone to retrieve the key from the county office's clerk, allowing them to unlock the door. Those unfamiliar with Dong Shuijing’s abilities wouldn’t recognize the name "Dong Bancheng," but his sticky rice wine had already found its way to the capital of the Great Li Dynasty, becoming a source of considerable wealth. It was said even the fairy boats, which flitted like sparrows among the clouds, would carry this wine, a clear sign of its popularity.

The four friends had once studied here together. Li Huai and Dong Shuijing carried buckets and cloths from Li Huai's ancestral home, while Shi Chunjia held a basket filled with their supplies. Lin Shouyi, a wealthy young master back in the day, had little opportunity to engage in such tasks, so when he offered to fetch water, Dong Shuijing chuckled and suggested they go to a nearby well he knew better.

With his hands empty, Lin Shouyi fell into easy conversation with Shi Chunjia.

Both their families had relocated to the capital, with Lin Shouyi’s father having been promoted to a court official, while Shi’s family was merely affluent. To the locals, they were seen as country bumpkins from afar, carrying the scent of mud with them. The Shi family had faced many business setbacks in the past and struggled to find anyone who would listen to their grievances. Shi Chunjia had previously joked about this when they were in Qilong Alley, but now, with just Lin Shouyi around, she opened up, teasing and lamenting about how her family had run into trouble in the capital. They had sought help from Lin Shouyi’s father, only to be met with indifference. It had ended up being just a tea visit, with Lin Shouyi’s father clearly unwilling to assist.

Now married, Shi Chunjia was no longer the carefree girl she once was, but she still valued her friendship with Lin Shouyi. How their parents interacted was a matter of the past; she had left the academy and become a wife and mother, cherishing her formative years even more.

Being able to vent her frustrations was a sign that she held no resentment in her heart.

Lin Shouyi didn't hide anything about his family, sharing, “You know what kind of man my father is and how my family is doing. Who dared to visit my home when we were classmates? Did you see how many times Bao Ping came over?”

The Lin family had always been peculiar in their interactions, preferring not to engage with outsiders. Lin Shouyi’s father, who worked at the construction office, was a completely different person at home—silent and stern. He was strict with Lin Shouyi, almost harsh. While he was well-regarded in his job, having good relationships with several construction officials, at home he came across as somewhat cold and unfeeling.

When Lin Shouyi was away studying at the Dashi Academy, the letters from home were always succinct, almost like accounts being settled.

No matter how well-known Lin Shouyi had become in the Great Li Dynasty, with a large reputation even in the capital, his father never acknowledged him, never once writing to ask him to come home for a visit.

Shi Chunjia recalled something and teased, “Lin Shouyi, even my friends have heard of you! You’ve made quite a name for yourself to be known in the capital. They say you could become a sage of the academy or even a refined immortal on a mountain, especially with such good looks…” 

As she spoke, Shi Chunjia turned to examine Lin Shouyi in his blue robe. “Wow, you really are handsome! I never noticed before; you always had that serious expression like a little scholar, which wasn’t charming at all.”

Lin Shouyi replied, “You should say that in front of Bian Wenmo.”

Shi Chunjia laughed, “I didn’t say you were more handsome than my husband!”

Lin Shouyi shook his head, choosing not to comment further.

Shi Chunjia sighed, “Back then, you and Li Huai always had the latest books. After a year, not much changed. Li Huai was too lazy to read; he would fall asleep as soon as he opened a book, while you were the most careful with yours.”

Lin Shouyi chuckled, “You still remember those little things?”

Shi Chunjia countered, “If I don’t remember these, what else should I remember?”

Lin Shouyi nodded, “It’s a good habit.”

After a moment of hesitation, he said, “If something comes up in the capital, I will seek Bian Wenmo’s help.”

Shi Chunjia was taken aback and then burst into laughter, pointing at Lin Shouyi, “You’ve always been the quiet one, yet you’re so indirect!”

Lin Shouyi didn’t need to rely on Bian Wenmo. This inclination to help others and build bridges was perhaps Lin Shouyi’s unique kindness.

At the academy, Li Huai was busy cleaning while loudly reciting the beginning of a family instruction text, “Rise at dawn, sweep the courtyard!”

Recalling the past, every morning, Mr. Qi would start cleaning the academy early, always doing it himself without letting the servant Zhao Yao do it.

Dong Shuijing chimed in with a smile, “To keep both inside and outside tidy.”

Shi Chunjia was wiping the table and raised the cloth in her hand, saying, “And when night falls, lock the doors.”

From a distance, Lin Shouyi smiled, “I must check everything personally.”

As he carefully wiped the window bars, he thought about studying in the mountains and cultivating his heart and character; it was all interconnected.

Shi Chunjia’s husband, Bian Wenmo, had also returned to Hua Huang County. As the town was both the county and government seat, Bian Wenmo needed to pay a visit to the county magistrate, Fu Yu.

Fu Yu was also of respectable lineage from the capital. The Bian and Fu families had some ancestral ties, both being part of the noble class of the Great Li Dynasty, though the Bian family was still somewhat lesser in status compared to the Fu family. However, the Fu family didn’t share the same level of prestige as the likes of the Cao and Yuan families. Fu Yu had once served as the secretary for the first county magistrate of Longquan, Wu Yuan, and was quite low-key.

After Longquan County was elevated to Longzhou, it governed the districts of Qingci, Baoxi, Sanjiang, and Xianghuo. The magistrate of Yuan County was promoted from within Qingci, while the other three magistrates were all from the capital, hailing from various noble and humble backgrounds. Baoxi County, however, was under Fu Yu’s jurisdiction.

While Bian Wenmo was willing to offer his greetings at the Baoxi County magistrate’s office, he dared not visit the Qingci office due to the weight of the prestigious families.

In fact, although Fu Yu held a position equal to the scion of the Yuan family, both were county magistrates, every time they went to the governor's mansion in the state capital for discussions, neither Fu Yu nor the governor Wei Li found it easy dealing with the Yuan magistrate.

This was not only due to the Yuan family’s background but also to the personal conduct and governance style of the Yuan magistrate.

Yu Lu and Xie Xie had first visited the ancestral home of the Yuan family before heading to the academy, selecting two empty seats.

Both had previously been students at the old Shanyan Academy of the Great Li Dynasty, but they weren’t as close to Mr. Qi as Li Huai and the others. As the remnants of the Lu family, they had only met Cui Dongshan and never had the opportunity to meet Mr. Qi, the founder of the academy and the town’s school.

Coincidentally, Song Jixin and his maid Zhi Gui were also revisiting the old grounds today. They didn’t sit in the academy classroom; apart from Zhao Yao, Song Jixin hardly interacted with Lin Shouyi and the others. Instead, he took Zhi Gui to the backyard, sitting at the stone table where Mr. Qi had taught him and Zhao Yao how to play chess, while Zhi Gui stood outside the north gate as usual.

Song Jixin’s expression was melancholic as he brushed his hand across the table’s surface.

He wondered if Zhao Yao, who had finally lost to him in chess, was doing well in distant lands.

Turning his head, he looked at Zhi Gui, who was idly bending a willow branch.

She stood on tiptoe, gently swaying the branch.

As he gazed at her lovely profile, he couldn’t bring himself to feel anger or resentment; he simply cherished the moment.

She turned her head and seemed to have completely forgotten the candidness of that day, returning to being his devoted maid. Letting go of the branch, she smiled sweetly, “Young Master, are you thinking of playing chess?”

Song Jixin shook his head slightly.

Besides Li Huai and Song Jixin, two unexpected figures from the officialdom arrived at the academy.

The diligent and pragmatic Yuan magistrate and the carefree Cao construction official.

Neither brought attendants—one was intentionally solitary, and the other simply had none.

In fact, both of them were contemporaries from the noble families and had once studied at the old Shanyan Academy of the Great Li Dynasty.

However, like the exiled prince Yu Lu, they had never seen Mr. Qi in person and had never heard his teachings.

Cao construction official leaned against the window, with a bright red wine gourd at his waist. It was made of ordinary material, but having spent many years in the town, it had become polished and cherished—his beloved item, worth its weight in gold.

Seeing the magistrate in a blue robe instead of official garments, Cao construction official exclaimed, “Yuan magistrate, you’re quite the busy person! Always spinning around like a top, never leaving your feet to rest on a chair! Don’t you get dizzy? How many important matters get delayed because of your trips to Hua Huang County?”

Yuan magistrate’s expression remained indifferent. “Talking to you is the real waste of time.”

The Yuan and Cao families of the Great Li Dynasty were the most reputable among the noble families on Baoping Continent. The reason was simple: the ancestral guardians depicted on the door gods were half of their ancestors. In the Huai Huang County, the old porcelain mountain’s Confucian temple and the divine grave’s martial temple also had their ancestors represented as golden statues, enjoying worship.

Cao construction official took a sip from his wine gourd, squinting as though every drink was a moment of fulfillment in life.

Standing tall and straight, Yuan magistrate contrasted starkly with the relaxed Cao construction official. This well-regarded member of the Yuan family remarked, “I wonder if the ever-courteous Yuan magistrate bows down and prostrates himself before the portraits of his ancestors every time he passes.”

Cao construction official was famously down-to-earth, fond of drinking—not excessive but rather savoring small sips, making it seem as though he was always drinking. His life seemed to revolve around purchasing wine, stopping to chat and joke with anyone along the way.

Fortunately, the office was located in the town, a tranquil place that didn’t attract scrutiny from higher authorities. Although nominally under the Ministry of Rites, the Ministry of Personnel in the capital had no power over it. In reality, everyone in the Great Li Dynasty’s officialdom knew just how little oversight the Ministry of Rites had concerning the Longquan pottery industry.

Cao construction official had specifically instructed his assistants to write “good” or “extremely good” for all evaluations of officials and clerks in the office. If someone only received a “good” rating, sending them good wine was essential; otherwise, their rating wouldn’t remain as favorable the following year.

The rules of the pottery office were straightforward: easy to manage, making it so all officials, whether from the noble or humble backgrounds, would be left aghast and eventually pleased, realizing they had found a chief who was easy to deal with. Finding someone of such character was rare.

Cao construction official had long since become adept at speaking the local dialect of the town, and whenever he spoke in the official tongue of the Great Li Dynasty, he felt out of place.

Shooting a sidelong glance at the familiar figure of his peer, he quipped, “I wonder if the ever-polite Yuan magistrate kneels and bows to the portraits of his ancestors every time he sees them.”

Had they not come to this town for their official duties, as a starting point in their careers, Yuan Zhengding would have never exchanged a single word with the laid-back Cao Gengxin, and Cao Gengxin would have likely initiated a conversation with Yuan Zhengding, but it would never have been so “subtle.”

Yuan Zhengding paused for a moment, “If you’re so unfocused, will you have the face to go to Chier Street in the future?”

Cao Gengxin swayed the wine gourd in his hand, chuckling, “Using your face to walk, eh? That’s quite the humorous remark, Yuan Daren! Next time someone in the capital dares to say your only flaw is your lack of humor, I’ll give them two slaps across the face.”

Yuan Zhengding pressed onward, “Do you still remember Guan Yiran and Liu Xunmei? If I recall correctly, those two young lads used to follow you around when we were younger.”

Although those two had not risen to high positions, they were now on equal footing with Yuan Zhengding and Cao Gengxin. The key point was that their political fortunes had taken a turn.

That was the conversion of civil and military identities.

Cao Gengxin smiled, “Yuan Daren, since you don’t recognize me, don’t presume to know who I am.”

Feigning surprise, Yuan Zhengding replied, “Oh? May I ask who you are?”

Cao Gengxin took a sip of wine and said, “When I’m sober, I’m Cao Jiu Gui; when I’m drunk, I’m Cao Da Jiu Xian.”

Yuan Zhengding chuckled, “Indeed, that’s a time-waster.”

Cao Gengxin shook his head, “I came to see Mr. Qi’s direct disciples, especially to ask Brother Dong for some sticky rice wine that doesn’t require credit. You, Yuan Daren, are here to curry favor with the prince; the difference is clear. I’m just a muddy figure in a filthy alley, while you are the shining copper mirror hanging above the door, upright and dignified.”

Yuan Zhengding frowned, “After all these years, have you only learned to talk?”

Cao Gengxin countered, “Have you learned anything yourself?”

Yuan Zhengding’s tone grew serious, “This isn’t a trivial matter!”

Cao Gengxin, holding the small gourd of wine, clasped his hands in a gesture of humility, “Yuan Daren, you just focus on your own rise and don’t worry about whether I’m making progress or not.”

Yuan Zhengding sighed inwardly.

He disliked this man’s style, but deep down, he still hoped this member of the Cao family could take his career a bit more seriously.

Of course, Yuan Zhengding primarily thought of himself.

In any case, whether in officialdom, literature, or the martial world, the affairs of the world are strange; all those who enjoy the spectacle love to see rivals of equal stature, willing to pay more attention to the conflict. If someone rides ahead alone, it might not be a good thing.

The responsibilities of the pottery office were quite significant.

Yuan Zhengding felt envious.

They were responsible for preventing theft and could even catch thieves themselves.

In the town, the four major clans—Song, Zhao, Lu, Li, Chen, and Shi—were all under the purview of the supervisory office, which ostensibly only monitored the production of imperial porcelain. In reality, it held authority over nearly everything, from the Yang family shop to the peaks of Mount Bei Yue, from Lin Lu Academy to the Longquan Sword Sect, and even to the various temples and shrines across the town, including the City God Temple and the Iron Talisman River.

Even practitioners of the Dao with the peace of mind plaques could be inspected by the Cao construction official, for the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Rites of the Great Li Dynasty wouldn’t dare question it.

However, this appointed construction official seemed to have chosen not to bother with anything at all.

Yuan Zhengding felt both pleased and worried. He was happy that his neighbor, who would have been a future rival in the Great Li court, was so ineffectual. Yet he was concerned about the ambitious young emperor, who might one day lose patience with Cao Gengxin and simply replace him with someone else. If Yuan Zhengding were to be promoted to the governor of Longzhou in the future, he might find himself tied down.

After all, the lessons of the past were clear: the new construction official would not be easy to deal with.

Not far from the academy.

Ma Kuxuan stood with his maid, Shu Dian.

They exchanged glances with Cao Gengxin and Yuan Zhengding, but neither party seemed inclined to greet the other. They were never on the same path.

Ma Kuxuan remarked, “My grandmother loved to scold people when she was alive, always doing it to their faces—never daring to do it behind their backs. Among those she knew, there were only three people she wouldn’t scold. Mr. Qi from the academy was one of them. My grandmother said Mr. Qi was genuinely a good person.”

Ma Kuxuan smirked, crossing his arms and reclining against a yellow mud wall. “In my hometown, we speak our minds freely.”

Ma Kuxuan chuckled and then said something strange: “When the back is there, it’s okay.”

Shu Dian didn’t understand at all; it was probably a local saying.

She only noticed that the town dialect was quite flat and lacked intonation.

Ma Kuxuan, rarely engaging in harmless conversation, explained with a smile, “It means that when you hear what others say, it’s like carrying a burden—can you bear its weight?”

A young man from the Mud Bottle Alley, passing by Chen Ping’an’s ancestral home, paused for a long time.

Gu Can had initially planned to head straight to the state capital but, after some thought, decided to head toward the academy.

Meanwhile, at the ferry crossing of Niu Jiao Mountain, a tall man who had returned home after leaving for a long time disembarked from a cross-continental ferry heading to the North Ju Lu Continent.

Ruan Xiu smiled and greeted, “Hello, Liu Xianyang.”

Liu Xianyang walked briskly towards her, beaming, “Ruan girl!”

Ruan Xiu nodded and tossed him a sword token, which allowed him to travel freely across Longzhou.

In fact, in just a few years, Liu Xianyang would become a direct disciple at the Longquan Sword Sect.

He was merely borrowing time from the Chen family of the South Posa Continent for twenty years.

After receiving the sword token, Liu Xianyang bid farewell and immediately soared back to his ancestral home, then visited a nearby tomb before finally returning to the town.

At the entrance of Mud Bottle Alley, he ran into Gu Can.

Gu Can didn’t retaliate.

A woman dressed in red, leaping through the clouds, reconsidered her plans. After calculating the time, she decided against heading to the Great Li capital and instead took a detour back to her hometown.

Looking down, she landed near the academy.

Having visited the Qilong Alley for some festive pastries, Ruan Xiu was also on her way to the academy.

Thus, the already bustling academy became even more crowded.

Bian Wenmo left the magistrate’s office and rode his horse-drawn carriage to a street near the academy. He lifted the curtain of the carriage and was surprised to see Cao construction official and Yuan magistrate standing together.

Weighing the pros and cons, he decided it was unnecessary to make formal greetings since both young nobles were present. He dropped the curtain and instructed the coachman to move the carriage elsewhere.

As for the others near the academy, Bian Wenmo either recognized them or had dealings with them before, or they were strangers he had no interest in.

He simply waited for Shi Chunjia to leave the small academy so they could head back to the Great Li capital together.

A frail-looking scholar had a change of heart, taking his brother Long Bo along, and carefully strolled around the town.

Attracted by the “commotion” at the academy, Liu Chicheng gritted his teeth and silently told himself he was just here to take a look, not to stir up trouble. In this little place, if some random brat were to jump up and slap him in the face, he’d still be forced to smile back!

Thus, Liu Chicheng and Long Bo found themselves witnessing a scene at the academy.

Almost everyone began to disperse from the academy at the same time, so at one moment, all of them fell into the view of the pedestrians on the street.

There was Ruan Xiu, with her ponytail and blue attire.

Li Baoping in her red cotton jacket.

Li Huai, Lin Shouyi, Dong Shuijing.

Yu Lu, Xie Xie.

Ma Kuxuan.

Song Jixin with Zhi Gui.

Liu Xianyang and Gu Can.

Those figures caught glimpses of Liu Chicheng, who stood by the roadside.

Especially Gu Can, who wore a playful smile.

Liu Chicheng felt a chill run down his spine, regretting his decision to come. He should never have come here. If the place were deserted, he would have slapped Long Bo across the face by now! How could he not advise him on how to be a good friend?

Without the cultivation of the elder, his vision was still sharp, but he felt even more suffocated than Liu Chicheng. He thought, “With my life in ruins, what’s the harm in it?”

Liu Chicheng humbly asked, “Long Bo, how long do you think you could survive here if you were to make a living?”

Long Bo was at a loss for words.

But as those people moved further away from the academy and closer to the street, Long Bo felt increasingly suffocated.

Liu Chicheng stopped holding back and smiled at Long Bo, “Did you know, I’m a close friend of Chen Ping’an?!”

Long Bo thought for a moment and nodded, “So am I.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 772: Another Bowl of Spring Noodles

Inside the Yang Family Shop, the atmosphere felt unusually tranquil. Li Er, Zheng Dafu, Su Dian, and Shi Ling Mountain—these disciples had all set off on their journeys one after another. Old Yang was enjoying his quiet time, while Yang Shu stood guard at the front of the shop, a lad who couldn’t understand human speech. Old Yang couldn’t be bothered to say a word more to him. Of course, Yang Shu also had no desire to be associated with that old man. That stubborn turtle truly thought of himself as important! If it weren't for the old Yang family's sentimental ties, the shop would have barely made a profit throughout the year given its lackluster business. If it were up to Yang Shu to run things, he would have already counted the accounts properly.

Just then, Wei Ban and Ruan Qiong arrived almost simultaneously.

One was the Mountain Lord of North Peak, and the other a local sage, both arriving quietly.

Ruan Qiong was more casual, sitting on the long bench under the eaves, sipping on some wine. This time, he had brought back some fine liquor from his home, which he usually wouldn’t splurge on. 

Wei Ban stood beside the bench, his expression serious.

This long bench had hosted many saints in the past.

Old Yang was seated on the steps outside the main house, shrouded in white mist.

Ruan Qiong put away his wine flask and got straight to the point: “If Xiuxiu hadn’t gone to the school, I wouldn’t have come.”

Old Yang chuckled, “I can’t control her. Ruan Qiong, this is your own fault.”

Ruan Qiong nodded. Having received that answer, as long as it wasn’t Old Yang’s scheme, that was enough. 

However, Wei Ban felt increasingly heavy-hearted. Without Ruan Qiong as a natural ally, this little Mountain Lord had a lot of pressure on him.

To be honest, dealing with this old predecessor was never easy for anyone.

Old Yang tapped his smoking pipe against the steps and said, “The Lord of Baidi City is in the capital of Dali, watching over this place. He might visit at any moment.”

Ruan Qiong frowned deeply.

Wei Ban asked, “What about the National Teacher?”

Old Yang laughed, “If you could guess the intentions of that embroidered tiger, would you really find it easier to do things as a Mountain Lord in the future? I doubt it. Since that’s the case, why think too much?”

Back when Lyzhu Cave Heaven was shattered, numerous opportunities scattered, following people like pieces of broken porcelain falling from a table, landing in all directions.

The biggest five shares of fortune were associated with Ruan Qiong’s only daughter, Ruan Xiu, and the fire dragon bracelet on her wrist.

Gu Can had once asked for a little loach from Chen Ping’an, which he kept in his own water jar. After Liu Zhimiao took it away from the small town, the loach feasted in Shujian Lake and transformed into human form, naming itself Tan Xue.

In the company of Song Jixin and his maid Zhi Gui, there was a four-legged snake with horns on its forehead.

Prince Gao Xuan of the Great Sui bought a golden carp from Li Er, receiving a second one as a bonus, along with a high-ranking Dragon King basket.

Lastly, Zhao Yao, who left the small town early riding an ox cart, was Qīng Jìngchūn’s attendant. Besides that wooden dragon, the young man had also secretly hidden a spring seal as a parting gift from his master.

On the surface, only Zhao Yao was missing from his hometown.

However, Cui Zhan’s arrangements had ensured there would be no such oversight.

The Gao clan of the Great Sui and the Song clan of Dali signed a mountain alliance, a strategic move. As a hostage, Gao Xuan had been learning at the Piyun Mountain Deer Academy for years under the protection of the Gao family's ancestors. The golden carp had been nurtured in the mountain streams for years, and it was clear that the Dali court had secretly instructed the River Dragon and the Iron Symbol River, along with the three mountain gods including Song Yuzhang, not to disclose this matter.

Shujian Lake was another game in motion. Gu Can was at the center of it, while Ruan Xiu followed the Dali alchemist southward, chasing after a young man who was exceptionally fortunate but had been taken away from Dali’s martial realm. Ruan Xiu almost got involved herself. After the upheaval at Shujian Lake, Gu Can’s mother was terrified and chose to move back to her hometown. Eventually, she settled in the state capital, leading a prosperous life again for three reasons: Chen Ping’an’s suggestion, Gu Can’s agreement, and her own lingering fears from the events at Shujian Lake. 

Furthermore, after Gu Can’s father died and became a deity, he first accumulated merit in the haunted mansion of the bride ghost before being promoted to a renowned mountain god of the old Dali peaks. Once they returned to their hometown, life would be much more stable. 

Gu Can hoped her mother would stay away from trouble, and deep down, she couldn’t trust her master Liu Zhimiao, the chief offering of the True Realm Sect.

As for Song Jixin, when did he ever leave the chessboard? When was he not a pawn?

And Zhao Yao, how could he be an exception, truly escaping Cui Zhan’s schemes?

Ruan Qiong departed.

Wei Ban, however, was still reluctant to return to Piyun Mountain just like that.

This gathering felt too sudden and strange. Now that the young Mountain Lord was traveling far along the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zheng Dafu was also absent from Luopok Mountain. Wei Ban was worried that Zheng Dafu might change his mind and not head to the Lotus Root Blessed Land. All of this was this old predecessor's careful planning. Now, the mainstay of Luopok Mountain seemed to rest solely on Zhu Lian. In the Grand Master’s Hall on the Jise Peak, he would always be a guest without a seat.

Old Yang chuckled, “Wei Mountain Lord, why go to such lengths to repay that favor from years ago?”

Wei Ban forced a smile, “I must trouble the old predecessor to speak frankly. This matter is not targeted at Luopok Mountain, and if that’s the case, I won’t disturb your peace any further.”

Old Yang pondered, “There are some connections, but it isn’t directly aimed at Luopok Mountain. Cui Zhan has no need for that, and besides, you don’t trust Cui Zhan; you should at least trust Cui Dongshan.”

Wei Ban looked helpless; he truly didn’t trust that eccentric young man in white.

Old Yang concluded, “You should trust the three portraits hanging in the Grand Master’s Hall of Jise Peak, right?”

Wei Ban suddenly felt reassured, clarity washing over him, and he bowed in thanks.

Old Yang said, “Living amidst mountains and rivers, one seems like a carefree immortal, yet the clouds and water are mere illusions. Wei Mountain Lord, you cannot be blind to this.”

Wei Ban cupped his fists and smiled, “The beautiful scenery of the mortal world is both an illusion and a delight to the eyes. One cannot take advantage and then act coy.”

Old Yang laughed, “Wei Mountain Lord has a good temperament, quite relaxed indeed.”

Wei Ban felt somewhat at ease and took his leave.

Old Yang muttered to himself, “A good exchange of favors; borrowing again isn’t difficult.”

Everything—Cui Zhan’s plans—was to help Zhi Gui obtain a complete true dragon fortune in a manner deemed “justifiable,” without giving the saints from the Three Teachings any room to criticize.

Song Jixin held deep feelings for this maid who had been by his side, and he would surely be willing to pay dearly for the fortune of a mere four-legged snake. 

Ruan Xiu wouldn’t care about the gains or losses of a fire dragon. If she could do something for the Longquan Sword Sect, she would do it without hesitation.

After rapidly growing in Shujian Lake, Gu Can understood the true power of rules and naturally learned how to do business. After all, her parents’ future fates remained Gu Can’s soft spot.

Prince Gao Xuan had studied for many years at the Lin Deer Academy of Dali, and for the sake of the Gao clan’s country and territory, even surrendering a golden carp would feel like a knife to the heart, yet he would do it without hesitation.

As for Zhao Yao, if he couldn’t even keep that spring seal safe back then, how could he safeguard that wooden dragon now? It wouldn’t be easy.

Among the younger generation in the small town, the only one truly distanced from the chessboard was Chen Ping’an—not merely because he was far away at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Yet, Cui Zhan had the ability to pull Chen Ping’an back into the game, provided Chen Ping’an had a chance to return to his hometown.

But it remained uncertain whether, at that time, Chen Ping’an would be a pawn or the player.

Or perhaps, would he simply replace Cui Zhan?

In front of the pharmacy, Yang Shu saw an old scholar step over the threshold. Yang Shu smiled and asked, “Are you here to see a doctor or to buy some herbs? Did you bring a prescription?”

With such good manners, how well could the Yang Family Shop be doing?

The old man didn’t mind and chuckled, “I can save myself if I’m sick; just looking around.”

Yang Shu was a bit displeased and casually replied, “Herbs are already precious. Nowadays, it’s getting more difficult to gather them from the mountains. Customers are free to browse but shouldn’t go rummaging.”

The old scholar nodded.

He looked around and intended to head towards the backyard.

Yang Shu grew anxious; this old fellow was truly not being polite.

Unexpectedly, in a flash, the old scholar lifted the curtain and headed into the backyard. Yang Shu hesitated, grumbling a few words internally, thinking it would be better to quarrel with Old Yang. Both old geezers, one wouldn’t earn money, the other didn’t want to spend it—old arms and legs, best to be hurt for a hundred days.

Old Yang chuckled, “A rare guest.”

Cui Zhan stood nearby the long bench, not taking a seat, and smiled, “Since I’m a guest, all I can do is try to be less of an eyesore here.”

Old Yang said, “You seem to believe that Chen Ping’an can’t return to Baopingzhou for the time being, making it impossible for him to give that girl a finishing touch, so Dali has no choice but to take a step back and play a trump card?”

Cui Zhan nodded, “It’s a minor issue.”

The contract signed between Wang Zhu and Chen Ping’an back then was quite unstable. If Chen Ping’an’s luck ran out and he died midway, while Wang Zhu would lose her restraints, making it possible for her to re-sign a contract with Song Jixin, she would suffer considerable losses in fate during that transition. Thus, in those years, with her intelligence not fully awakened, Wang Zhu’s actions regarding Chen Ping’an’s life and death were often contradictory. For the greater scheme, she hoped Chen Ping’an would thrive. If one prospered, all prospered. Yet, being neighbors in Mud Bottle Alley meant they spent day and night together, and Wang Zhu, driven by her innate nature, secretly hoped for Chen Ping’an’s demise to solidify her resolve to capture Dali’s dragon vein and the Song clan’s national fortune.

She had been caught in this dilemma for many years, not daring to act recklessly and kill Chen Ping’an, fearing the saint’s suppression, yet unwilling to waste time with someone whose destiny was already broken. She also didn’t want to beg for mercy from heaven. The relationship between Song Jixin and Chen Ping’an, two peers, became a tangled mess. At the moment Chen Ping’an’s longevity bridge was severed, Wang Zhu had already harbored murderous intent, and thus the deal between Song Jixin and Fu Nanhua was secretly laced with danger.

But what happened later was overwhelming, causing Wang Zhu to retract significantly, no longer daring to act lightly.

To make a true dragon’s heart compassionate and empathetic to others was akin to demanding the emperor of Dali to become a moral paragon.

However, both Ruan Qiong and Wei Ban, who had visited earlier, seemed not to see the deeper implications.

The momentum had arrived; opportunities must not be missed. Cui Zhan had to make Wang Zhu condense the true dragon fortune in advance, seeking to restore her peak.

Yet, Cui Zhan’s arrangement for everyone to gather at the small town school was certainly not limited to this.

Old Yang grinned, “As a guest, you should be courteous. As a host, treat your guests kindly. Such a neighbor is indeed a blessing.”

Cui Zhan replied, “According to our agreement, as long as I live, I won’t allow the conflict of fire and water to repeat in this vast world.”

Old Yang asked, “What if you die? Does Cui Dongshan count as you? Will our agreement still stand?”

Cui Zhan chuckled, “You’ll have to ask him about that.”

Old Yang clicked his tongue, “When scholars dive wholeheartedly into business, they truly become more and more astute.”

Cui Zhan said, “I hope the old predecessor will also keep your promises.”

Old Yang nodded, “Of course, fair business has always been my principle.”

Ruan Xiu was born in the Wind and Snow Temple but followed her father to Lyzhu Cave Heaven to cultivate.

Li Liusheng was in Lyzhu Cave Heaven but followed his parents on a journey to Beiju Lu Island’s Lion Peak.

They occasionally crossed paths but would never remain neighbors for long.

Ruan Xiu looked around.

There was Li Baoping, who shared a mutual affinity, Pei Qian, the first disciple of Luopok Mountain, Liu Xianyang of the Longquan Sword Sect, and Gu Can, who had very few friends left in Mud Bottle Alley.

By Li Liusheng’s side was his younger brother Li Huai. Zhi Gui, the true dragon, naturally had an innate affinity with the Dao, so Song Jixin’s choice of camp was very clear. Ma Kuxuan, who was willing to follow Zhi Gui, was also influenced by his grandmother, who had been promoted to a river deity from the River Dragon.

She Lin Shouyi, and the swordsman Dong Shui Jing, both liked Li Liusheng.

Once major issues arose, the two temporarily nascent camps would have their own concerns. If every little matter accumulates, who could remain uninvolved in the end?

That would require someone willing to reason and capable of winning over both sides.

Chen Ping’an.

Cui Zhan’s chess moves didn’t treat those pieces as mere puppets. He had never thought that the lives and deaths of mortals were all in his hands, manipulating their fates like a game. Instead, it was necessary to quietly pave the way for those pieces, ensuring that their paths, though winding, could ultimately appear at key positions when needed.

If he sought the path of eternal life, Cui Zhan would not have betrayed the Confucian lineage.

If he desired power, becoming the Grand Master of the Academy and the Deputy Leader of the Central Plains Confucian Temple was within easy reach, and what difficulty would that pose?

Old Yang exhaled smoke, enveloping the pharmacy, and asked, “What about that matter?”

Cui Zhan rarely showed a hint of helplessness, “Not trusting others means that others also cannot bear this matter. It’s best to separate our souls; I will quietly observe Cui Dongshan. In a day, his thoughts can range from at least two to as many as seventy thousand. If I observe quietly, I’ll have at least three thoughts, and at most eighty thousand. We both have our strengths and weaknesses.”

Old Yang asked, “Have you sorted out those fundamental connections?”

Cui Zhan shook his head, “There’s considerable contention. The three levels of transformation and conversion have fundamental disagreements between us, almost entirely reversed in order, which is quite troublesome.”

Old Yang laughed and asked, “Why have you been deliberately avoiding asking me?”

Cui Zhan smiled, “In terms of age and realm, you’re the senior, and I’m the junior. But when it comes to calculations, we’re equals.”

Old Yang shook his head, “No need to be humble; you are the senior.”

Cui Zhan cupped his fists and smiled, “I dare not be too bold; I fear receiving this.”

Polite words; the Confucian lineage, from the teacher to the disciple to the passing disciple, all seemed quite adept at this.

Old Yang chuckled in amusement, fell silent for a moment, then sighed, “The old scholar has great insight in choosing disciples. The first disciple’s arrangements shine like stars, mastering sword techniques, like a nearly full moon hanging in the sky. Qi Jingchun’s knowledge is the highest, yet he remains grounded, safeguarding the mortal realm.”

Shujian Lake’s True Realm Sect is intertwined with the Yuguizong of Tongye Island.

The crossing ships of the Ghostly Sea Sect have made significant business.

The Mohist patriarch, the merchant clan’s ancestor, along with many still hidden behind the scenes, have all been invited to the gambling table by Cui Zhan. Now, even the Lord of Baidi City has graced Baopingzhou with his presence.

Cui Zhan sat on the long bench, gently resting his hands on his knees, self-mockingly saying, “Even the next game doesn’t seem promising.”

Old Yang laughed, “Cultivating for longevity is precious, while learning and knowledge despise destiny.”

Cui Zhan smiled, “Your words, old predecessor, bring great comfort to my heart.”

Liu Chicheng took Longbo along to accompany Gu Can on a trip to the state capital.

Now, Huai Huang County was well-connected, with numerous large and small roads.

Once the young people from the school dispersed, each heading home, the overwhelming pressure in Bai Fu’s heart suddenly decreased, leaving it hard to articulate.

Liu Chicheng keenly sensed Bai Fu’s change in mood and patted the shoulder of the white-haired youth, “Longbo, I didn’t expect you to have such wisdom; the Dao is promising!”

Bai Fu replied earnestly, “Thank you for your kind words, senior.”

Shi Chunjia boarded the carriage with her husband, Bian Wenmao, heading back to the capital of Dali. Li Baoping said she would find a horse to ride and would soon catch up to the carriage.

Li Huai, Lin Shouyi, and the others planned to return to the Great Sui Academy with Mao Xiaodong.

Cao Gengxin and Dong Shui Jing had made plans to drink at Huang Erniang’s tavern.

Governor Yuan Zhengding accompanied Song Jixin and the maid Zhi Gui, finding an excuse to go to the Old Porcelain Mountain to pay respects.

Ma Kuxuan took a few people to visit the Divine Immortal Tomb’s War Temple.

Liu Xianyang followed Ruan Xiu to the Longquan Sword Sect’s peak. As he wasn’t a direct disciple, he naturally did not need to go to the Grand Master’s Hall to light incense. He was merely there to take a stroll. However, Liu Xianyang mentioned he wanted to stop by Luopok Mountain first, and Ruan Xiu seemed to have been waiting for this suggestion. She proposed they could head to the Longquan Sword Sect first and then go to Luopok Mountain, which Liu Xianyang found reasonable.

Then, the two travelers on the wind saw Li Baoping walking toward the mountains.

The foreign youth from the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhang Jiazheng, and Jiang Qu, under the secret escort of the sword cultivator Cui Wei, ascended Luopok Mountain.

The housekeeper Zhu Lian had previously mentioned wanting the two to help at the Dragon Alley New Year shop. After Zhang Jiazheng and Jiang Qu discussed it, they thought it would be better to come here first to ask Old Zhu about some important matters.

Cui Wei actually had his own calculations and needed to obtain Zhu Lian’s consent.

Pei Qian happened to return from the Lotus Root Blessed Land with Xiao Mi Li and was delighted to see Zhang Jiazheng and Jiang Qu.

At the very least, she didn’t have to bother with Chen Nuanshu, who had a bag full of seeds. She had to entertain the two boys, who could be considered family.

Xiao Mi Li, clever as always, had previously been scolded by Nuanshu for buying too many seeds at high prices. Yet, she didn’t complain, pretending to be loyal and silent, but she kept glancing at Pei Qian. What was that supposed to mean?

Yuan had previously interacted with Zhang Jiazheng and Jiang Qu and had a good relationship, so they climbed the mountain together.

As for the silly Yuanbao, he was probably busy sparring with the silly Cen Yuankai at the mountaintop.

Li Baoping had come to Luopok Mountain to borrow that horse, which her junior uncle had brought back from Shujian Lake and had been raised in Luopok Mountain all these years.

Her junior uncle was always so sentimental.

Pei Qian, upon hearing that Baoping sister had arrived at the mountain gate, immediately rushed over with a child rubbing his ears.

From over a hundred steps away, Pei Qian leaped high, landing gracefully in front of Li Baoping.

Zhou Mi Li, shouldering a small golden burden and holding a hiking stick, imitated her, suddenly stopping, kneeling slightly, and lightly calling out. Unexpectedly, she exerted too much force and ended up tumbling toward the foot of the mountain's gate.

Pei Qian reached out, pulling her back to her side.

The little girl in black swayed unsteadily, laughing heartily.

Seeing Pei Qian, who had jumped over quickly, Li Baoping pinched the young girl’s cheek, then bent down, clapped her hands on Mi Li’s cheeks, lightly twisting them. The little girl’s sparse, slightly yellow eyebrows suddenly became one high and one low, looking quite amusing.

Under Yuan's lead, Zhang Jiazheng and Jiang Qu explored the Mountain God Temple, a shrine with almost no incense offerings.

Cen Yuankai and Yuanbao were indeed sparring in the square, just as Pei Qian had guessed.

The three boys sat side by side on the railing in the distance.

Zhang Jiazheng merely glanced at the two sisters who stood gracefully as they finished their punches.

He turned his gaze towards the overlapping mountains and rivers outside Luopok Mountain, coincidentally spotting a large flock of birds flying by, like a white river suspended in midair, swaying slowly.

While working as a shop assistant at the tavern on the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhang Jiazheng had once privately asked Teacher Chen a question.

“Your knowledge is vast, Teacher; did you learn it all from the old Confucian master himself?”

The storyteller, who had shared tales of mountains and rivers while holding a bench and bamboo stick, walked alongside the boy in the streets, shaking his head and laughing, “Not quite. In the beginning, there was a school in my hometown; the teacher’s surname was Qi. Teacher Qi said that principles are in books while being a person is outside of books. If you ever have the chance to visit my hometown, you can check out that school. If you truly want to study, there’s also a new school with a learned teacher.”

At that time, Zhang Jiazheng recalled that saying regarding principles and books.

Teacher Chen raised a hand, pointing into the distance, smiling, “For a child who hasn’t read books, hearing this phrase is like... discovering a mountain of gold and silver. The road might be long, but it’s visible. Carrying a firewood axe, a plow, or a basket, one can earn a lot of money! Suddenly, it offers a sense of hope, as if there’s finally a day when they won’t have to worry about food and clothing.”

In truth, many of Teacher Chen’s words unrelated to principles were quietly remembered by the boy.

In the vast world, there were many impoverished families. The so-called good life was merely being able to put up new door gods and spring couplets each year. The so-called wealth meant having enough money to buy numerous door gods and couplets. However, the places where houses could display door gods and couplets were limited; it wasn’t that they didn’t have money, but rather they were envious yet unable to afford them.

When the boy finally arrived in Teacher Chen’s hometown, Teacher Chen remained far away from the boy’s homeland.

On the second floor of the bamboo house.

Li Baoping, along with the young girl Pei Qian and her companions Chen Nuanshu and Zhou Mi Li, leaned over the railing to admire the scenery.

The taller ones didn’t need to stand on tiptoe.

The shortest, Zhou Mi Li, hung over the railing.

It felt like at any moment, they might suddenly see a returning traveler with a hiking stick and a bamboo box.

Then, upon raising their heads, they would smile and wave at them.

Pei Qian quietly asked, “Today the bright moon is over the river, tomorrow the stars will hang over the fields; does that mean Master will return home the day after tomorrow?”

Li Baoping replied, “It seems junior uncle has been busy for others, not resting since the first day he left home. Staying a bit longer at the Sword Qi Great Wall is quite nice; it’s like a break.”

Chen Nuanshu laughed, “I heard there’s also a tavern over there, with seeds and big bowls of spring noodles.”

Zhou Mi Li nodded vigorously, swinging her dangling feet, “Spring noodles are delicious; the bigger the bowl, the better.”

At the tavern on the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping’an had just returned for the second time, freshly dressed in clean clothes. He sat at a table, ordered a jug of wine, and enjoyed a bowl of spring noodles alone. Although he had told the child not to add scallions, they still ended up putting in a small handful.

The second shopkeeper rarely came here, so while the bowl wasn’t large, the spring noodles were substantial, and it made sense to put in extra scallions.

Feng Kangle and Tao Ban, two children, sat at the adjacent table, watching the second shopkeeper bend over to enjoy his meal.

Chen Ping’an turned his head, raised his empty bowl, and smiled, “Another bowl, please, and remember no scallions this time, no need for them.”

(End of Chapter)

 # Chapter 773: Turning Over the Old Calendar

Gu Can arrived at the entrance of the state city mansion. At the entrance, two imposing white jade lions, crafted by celestial hands, guarded the gates. Even a starving beggar would lack the courage to approach the door for alms in their presence.

Gu Can did not rush to knock on the door.

Liu Chicheng and Chai Bofu could do nothing but stand outside, braving the chilly wind.

Gu Can ascended the spotless steps and reached for the beast-head door knocker. He paused, his fingers lingering for a moment. This was a golden-painted door knocker shaped like a mythical creature, reserved for nobles. Gu Can sighed inwardly; he shouldn't be so presumptuous. Even though there was a peace and prosperity talisman in his home, it shouldn’t be treated lightly. The governor’s mansion of the state city must have received confidential information from the kiln supervision office, which is why they didn’t scrutinize this matter too closely. Still, it was best to inform his mother about it; there was no need to act so extravagantly at the entrance, as it could easily lead to complications.

Gu Can knocked on the door and took a step back. A well-dressed steward opened the door and, seeing Gu Can in plain clothes, frowned and asked, "Which family’s young master are you? Or are you from the government?"

Gu Can was momentarily taken aback, recalling how much his appearance had changed. It was only natural that the steward wouldn’t recognize him, unlike the elders from Qingxia Island. Years ago, his mother had left Shujian Lake with a close maid, and after many years of cultivation, they had all become Qi practitioners, albeit at a low level, and thus would not involve themselves in the household's affairs. Gu Can had detailed their cultivation progress in letters to his mother over the years and had even helped select several treasures from the mountains. They just needed to cultivate step by step, refine their innate items, and break through their limitations.

The steward quickly glanced at the two individuals standing at the bottom of the steps behind the young man—a frail scholar and a young boy with white hair—and immediately assumed he had gauged the background of the three.

The steward himself was a pure martial artist, concealing his true strength. At the fifth realm, he was indeed skilled in the common martial world. In any small vassal state, he could easily establish a sect. Being a steward and guarding the place was beneath him; he was likely either wealthy enough to afford it or a fugitive seeking refuge. The worst-case scenario was that he harbored ulterior motives, scheming to fish for a big catch, colluding with wild cultivators, and coveting the mansion’s considerable wealth. Gu Can had navigated the martial world for many years, witnessing numerous intertwined scams, and had intentionally observed from a distance, witnessing two con games unfold. One family, known for their wealth and lack of compassion, ended up ruined. Gu Can had appeared when the bandits were dividing the spoils, asking them for advice, but they were secretive and evasive. So, he had let Zeng Yi show off his skills and seize knowledge from them. Another family, appearing to have good morals, Gu Can had casually helped out of trouble.

Gu Can smiled and said, "I am Gu Can; this is my home."

The steward’s expression changed instantly. He bowed his head and stepped aside, saying, "I've seen the young master; I'll go report to the lady right away."

Gu Can crossed the threshold and waved his hand, saying, "No need; it’s just a few steps away. You don’t have to trouble yourself to report."

The steward smiled obsequiously, "At first glance, I almost mistook the young master for a gentleman scholar from the academy."

The steward had already figured out the household’s background. The master was a cultivator who had been away for many years, a matter that was vaguely discussed in the mansion, likely something unspeakable. The young master was a seed of the scholarly world studying outside, so only a wealthy woman remained at home. Every time that lady mentioned her son, she was filled with pride. If it weren’t for the two maidservants beside her, who were also practicing Qi, they would have acted long ago to seize this wealth. So, for this year, they had specifically pulled in a friend from the path to focus on one of the maids.

Gu Can chuckled, "Good eye."

Liu Chicheng nodded, "Indeed, very good."

Chai Bofu glanced at the pure martial artist and thought, Poor guy, truly poor. With so many paths to wealth, he ended up stumbling into this family. A den of self-proclaimed clever foxes, blindly jumping into the dragon's den. What were they seeking, if not death?

Liu Chicheng slapped Chai Bofu on the head, saying, "Long Brother, what’s the matter? Why are you so quiet? Do you think our Young Master Gu isn’t worthy of being a gentleman scholar?"

Chai Bofu felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His vital points trembled, and the Dragon Gate realm he had only just stabilized was now in jeopardy! Chai Bofu quickly said, "Young Master Gu is more than worthy!"

Ordinary rascals would usually try to scare someone first before acting, but this particular senior beside him was the type to act first and reason later.

However, having spent enough time together, Chai Bofu's aspiration to follow the path grew firmer. He was determined to become a disciple of the Bai Di City genealogy in Central Continent.

The steward closed the door but suddenly felt a chill at the back of his neck. It turned out Gu Can had reached out and grabbed him by the neck, pressing his head against the door. Gu Can's fingers were already seeping with blood, demonstrating how ruthless he could be, as he quietly asked, "With the door closed, are you not worried about outsiders laughing at you? Speak! How many people are inside? Who is the highest in cultivation?"

Gu Can suddenly released his grip and turned around, smiling as he looked into the distance, exposing his back to the pure martial artist.

A woman rushed over, stumbling several times on her trailing skirt. Upon seeing her son after so many years, tears welled up in her eyes.

Suffering for survival, working hard for wealth, in the end, wasn’t it all for this ungrateful brat who only sent home letters?

Gu Can quickly approached, and the woman embraced her son, choking with sobs. Gu Can gently patted her back, maintaining a calm demeanor as he smiled at the two maidservants, who were adorned in finery and belonged to him.

The two young women exchanged a glance with Gu Can, immediately lowering their heads, their hands and feet turning cold, as if they had fallen into an ice cavern.

The woman released Gu Can, wiped her tears, and began to scrutinize her son. At first, she felt proud, but then she wondered how much hardship her son had endured alone in the outside world. She covered her mouth and began to sob again, blaming herself, resenting her late husband who had inexplicably become a mountain deity, resenting Chen Ping'an for leaving Gu Can behind, killing that charcoal snow, and resenting the heavens for allowing Gu Can to suffer so much.

After Gu Can and his mother reminisced in the main hall, he stepped into his own study for the first time. Liu Chicheng led Long Brother to wander around the mansion, while Gu Can summoned the two maidservants and the steward, who had been too afraid to act.

Gu Can moved a chair to lean against the window, resting an elbow on the armrest and propping his chin in one hand, asking, "A big tree attracts the wind; it’s inevitable. I won’t be too harsh on you two regarding this matter, especially since my mother also has her faults. However, forgetting one’s roots isn’t a good thing. Does my mother know about outsiders sneaking into the mansion to set traps?"

The two maidservants had already knelt on the ground.

One maidservant looked bewildered.

The other maidservant nodded, saying, "I mentioned it to the lady, but she said to treat it as mere boredom."

Gu Can hesitated for a moment and asked, "Did my father arrange any backup plans?"

The maidservant replied in a low voice, "Master is very concerned about the lady's safety. He not only contacted the local city god but also cast spells on the door gods. There is an older martial artist at the seventh realm in the mansion, who originally served in the border troops and hails from the old mountain region of the Great Li. He has become acquainted with Master and was invited here. Now, he is living in hiding, serving as a guard, keeping a close watch on the steward and his crew."

The steward's mind went blank.

A person who could befriend the city god of Longzhou City and have a seventh realm master as a guard? 

Why was he being belittled by that small-minded woman, who repeatedly called him a useless dead man?

Gu Can felt helpless. What kind of incense and fire was this? The seventh realm masters of the Great Li were all documented, and the court was keeping a close eye on them. They were likely on par with that down-and-out mountain deity, Song Yuzhang. They were indeed protecting the Gu residence, but it was more about keeping a watchful eye. That mountain deity father of Gu Can, whom he had no memory of, would certainly not disclose such inside information to worry her unnecessarily.

Gu Can looked at the pure martial artist, who was still contemplating how to survive, and said without cause, "The person behind this may indeed be a master, but as for you, forget it. It’s still unclear who set it up or whether there was even a setup at all."

Gu Can muttered, "People die for wealth, birds perish for food. How are there so many fools under the heavens?"

A cheerful voice chimed in, "Isn’t this a good thing? In a game of chess, if you throw pieces randomly, how can you talk about having the first move? Only the younger, clever ones can stand out and surpass the predecessors."

Gu Can stood up solemnly. The room was empty, yet he remained respectful, clasping his fists in a bow.

A man in white appeared beside Gu Can, saying, "Pack your things; come with me to Bai Di City. Before we set off, you should visit Huang Lake Mountain with Liu Chicheng and meet that old Daoist named Jia Sheng. If he is willing to appear, you will be my little junior brother. If not, you can rest easy as my named disciple."

The man in white held out a scroll, an old "Mountain Search Map," and handed it to Gu Can. "Take this to Huang Lake Mountain."

Before arriving at this mansion, the man had retrieved this map from Lin Shouyi as a return favor for helping Lin complete a volume of "The Book Above the Clouds," which originally came from Bai Di City, gifting it with the lower two scrolls. Though Lin Shouyi was a scholar, he had made rapid progress in cultivation, quickly reaching the cave realm and focusing on the foundational aspects of "The Book Above the Clouds." His skills were immense, and the thunder techniques contained within were authentic. Yet, this wasn't the greatest essence of "The Book Above the Clouds." Opening pathways and cultivating without hindrance was the core goal of "The Book Above the Clouds." The author of this text was the lord of Bai Di City, who had personally edited and refined it, eliminating many unnecessary details.

Where in the world is the highest cloud above?

Naturally, it is Bai Di City.

As for how the upper volume of the Dao book ended up in Lin Shouyi's hands, it was certainly due to A Liang's involvement, as the literati often borrowed books without returning them. It was no wonder Lin Shouyi took a liking to this text; his fate with it was excellent.

Since it was A Liang's gift, Bai Di City didn't mind Lin Shouyi’s minor "accidental transgressions" against the mountain.

However, Lin Shouyi, after revealing his name, still refused to elaborate on the source of the "Mountain Search Map."

This was the very reason the lord of Bai Di City was willing to gift the final volume of "The Book Above the Clouds." Initially, giving a mid-volume would have meant Lin Shouyi would be reduced to a pawn and suffer a calamity.

Gu Can's expression remained blank, but his heart was shaken. He knew of Jia Sheng!

An honorary worshipper of the Down-and-Out Mountain, a lucky blind old Daoist who could get by in Qilong Alley, had taken two obedient disciples: a young man with a limp, Zhao Denggao, a demon, and Tian Jiu’er, whose blood was the best material for talismans. It was said that Jia Sheng had moved to Huang Lake Mountain to cultivate a few years ago.

The Down-and-Out Mountain had such a person lying low, and how did Zhu Lian and Wei Bo not notice a single trace of him?

"If I hadn't come to this place, no one in Down-and-Out Mountain would ever know about such a person. Jia Sheng would die simply as Jia Sheng, and perhaps during his cultivation journey, he would naturally go to the Fifth Realm. On the day he ascends, he will change his body and reincarnate endlessly, relishing the cycle."

The man in white chuckled, "Don’t overthink it; it's just his usual way of playing with the world. After he put away his sword back then, he completely changed as a person. Good at self-deception, he doesn’t like deceiving others. He has faced countless disasters and misfortunes on the mountain and below, yet he has never once acted to protect himself. In the vast world of righteousness, every continent, he stays for several hundred years. Furthermore, while I am his nominal disciple, Bai Di City was established entirely by me; he has nothing to do with it."

Gu Can suddenly said, "Then I won’t need to visit Huang Lake Mountain. I won’t disturb the old senior’s peace; I’ll just follow the city lord to Central Continent."

The man in white smiled, "If you can say that, then you definitely should meet him."

Gu Can asked, "What about the three people in the room?"

The two maidservants and the steward remained perfectly still.

The man in white glanced at the three, then extended a hand. The three, including the pure martial artist, were forced into a trance, dazed and confused, their feet leaving the ground as they slowly floated to the front of the man in white. He casually pointed at their foreheads a couple of times, and the three spirits returned to their bodies. Gu Can focused his gaze and saw that from the center of each person’s forehead, threads began to spread outward.

Then the three suddenly "woke up." The steward, as a pure martial artist, suddenly burst into tears, kneeling and saying, "Young Master!"

One maidservant kowtowed vigorously, "This servant pays respects to the sect master!"

The other maidservant fell to the ground, utterly heartbroken, "Master, forgive me!"

The man in white waved his sleeve, and the three fainted again. He laughed, explaining, "It’s as if they had a long slumber, waking from a dream. They are still the same people, only with a bit more life experience added."

Gu Can broke out in a cold sweat.

This was the demonic method of Bai Di City!

Only at this moment did he understand why every time Liu Chicheng mentioned this person, there was such reverence.

He could casually turn a person into someone who was no longer who they once were, yet they still firmly believed they were themselves.

Then what of all the grudges and enmities, all the so-called cultivation of the great way? What did they really mean?

The man in white chuckled, "Is life and death the greatest matter? Then what truly is life and death? Once I understood this, some people didn’t want me to leave Bai Di City."

He concluded, "That old man came to this Li Zhu Cave Heaven, not to completely sever karmic ties, but just to wander around? Finally, he has shown a bit of the demeanor of a master; I’m surprised this time."

Beside a thatched cottage on Huang Lake Mountain.

In the depths of the great mountains, water flowed gently.

The blind old Daoist stepped out of the cottage during a break from his cultivation, sighing to himself. After his good brother Chen Lingjun traveled far away, he no longer had anyone to chat with about the mountains. It was truly lonely.

The so-called dedicated cultivation was merely an excuse to find a new place to live. He was no longer cooped up in that shabby place in Qilong Alley, at least it was closer to Down-and-Out Mountain. He could return to Qilong Alley later, and with each back and forth, his identity as an honorary worshipper would become even more solidified. The shopkeeper of the neighboring new year shop would have to treat him with more respect when they next met, wouldn’t they?

Jia Sheng suddenly felt somewhat fearful.

He sensed a ripple in front of him, as if guests had arrived.

Jia Sheng immediately stiffened, raising his voice, "Two guests, visiting uninvited and without a greeting—this isn’t very proper."

Liu Chicheng nearly popped his eyes out.

Sometimes, when observing a person, appearances, souls, and aura can all conceal identities, making it hard for others to recognize someone who is so close. 

But in certain subtle aspects, if one digs deeper, the traces become obvious, such as the blind old Daoist's posture and the curvature of his fingers while forming seals, among others.

Adding to the fact that the senior brother had not explained, Liu Chicheng immediately thought of the most unlikely "what if," crouching down to the ground and trembling as he said, "Disciple pays respects to Master!"

Jia Sheng felt a bit guilty. Where did this wild disciple come from?

Liu Chicheng kept his head to the ground, feeling immensely wronged, "Master, Senior Brother bullied me terribly. First, he drove me out of Bai Di City for a trivial matter, then he let me be chased by the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain with a sword, leaving this poor disciple trapped in this little Bao Ping Island for a thousand years, no one cared for me. Senior Brother showed no regard for our brotherhood; Master, you must seek justice!"

It was not that Liu Chicheng was making things up. The Master had always favored this disciple, and many senior brothers and sisters harbored resentment towards him precisely because of this.

The old Daoist nearly jumped in anger, cursing, "What Bai Di City, what Grand Master of Longhu Mountain? Is there anyone in the world so shameless among my fellow practitioners? If I, Jia Sheng, were really your master, I would be blind to accept you as a disciple..." Jia Sheng suddenly froze, realizing he was indeed blind.

Gu Can admired Liu Chicheng's boldness, truly meeting a high-level individual. He brought up the lord of Bai Di City as his senior brother, and now faced with the true senior brother, he began to mention his master?

Gu Can raised the "Mountain Search Map" in his hand, solemnly saying, "Old Senior, here’s the item returning to its rightful owner."

Jia Sheng naturally opened his eyes and saw the scroll, sighing, "To take on such a big disciple, truly, it seems I haven’t turned over the old calendar."

Then Jia Sheng froze, gently shaking his head. What strange thoughts were these? The old Daoist blinked hard; the world was bright once more, everything in sight.

The odd thunder techniques he had practiced in his own mountain were obscure and cost him dearly—first injuring his organs and then losing his sight, preventing him from seeing anything for many years.

After a momentary daze, the old Daoist, Jia Sheng, retreated, his mind condensed like a mustard seed, falling into a deep slumber while another person took over all his awareness.

The old man lowered his head, tugged at his Daoist robe, then turned his gaze towards the Great Scholar’s Block of Huaihuang County, and then shifted his focus to the True Pearl Mountain and all the dragon kilns within view. His expression grew complex as he ignored both Liu Chicheng and Gu Can, falling into deep thought.

The old man opened his palm, gazed at the patterns in his hand for a moment, and finally muttered, "In this life, a small dream; after waking, Lu Chen has deceived me greatly."

With a single step, the blind old Daoist Jia Sheng stood still, still in deep slumber.

When the old man revealed his true form, he appeared as a tall, thin elder with a refined appearance, reminiscent of a handsome youth with remarkable charisma in his younger days.

The old man's cultivation journey had been like a dazzling meteor in the vast world of righteousness, rising rapidly compared to the long river of time, but falling just as swiftly.

So much so that even the lord of Bai Di City was his first disciple, such a significant matter was known to only a handful of people in the entire world.

The old man was Jia Sheng, and yet he was much more than just Jia Sheng; behind him, Jia Sheng would eventually become just Jia Sheng.

In his lifetime, he would only do one thing, well-known throughout the world.

With a single sword, he would slay the dragons of the world.

Killing until only the last true dragon remained.

In the old calendar of the vast world, because of one person's sword, several pages were ripped away!

When the old man appeared, the giant python that once vied with Gu Can for water in Huang Lake, which had lost, sank abruptly, as if pressured by the will of heaven, submerging into the depths of the lake, trembling in fear, wishing it could bury its head into the mountain's roots.

The old man glanced at Gu Can, stretched out a hand to receive the scroll, tucking it into his sleeve. He then patted Gu Can's shoulder and nodded, smiling, "Good root and bone, a fine seedling. I shall take you as my disciple in place of my master."

Liu Chicheng was struck by lightning, sitting dazed on the ground, no longer howling.

This shouldn't be happening; it absolutely must not happen.

Once Gu Can held such an identity, it would not be long before he, Liu Chicheng, would take a step ahead on the path to the underworld!

The man in white appeared out of nowhere.

The old man glanced sideways at him, saying, "I am now basically a useless person. I can't defeat you, my disciple, but after all, the master-disciple title is still there. What, are you unhappy? Do you wish to betray your master? Just like in swordsmanship, I never taught you this."

The man in white remained silent, a hint of killing intent flickering.

Unexpectedly, the old man pressed forward, seemingly unconcerned about the lord of Bai Di City’s murderous intent, asking, "What are you dazed for? Call me your little master uncle."

The man in white showed no regard for seniority and merely asked, "Are you sure this is for Gu Can's benefit?"

Gu Can knelt on the ground, bowing his head seriously, "Gu Can pays respects to Ancestor Master."

The old man burst into hearty laughter.

Transforming into a beam of sword light, he instantly shot off into the distance, heading north to play with his good brother, Chen Lingjun. 

But the next time they met, he wouldn’t recognize him, and Chen Lingjun would not recognize him either.

The man in white looked up at the sword light vanishing into the north, saying with a smile, "You should treat your closed-door disciple a bit better."

Liu Chicheng let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, Gu Can was just his little junior brother.

Otherwise, with such a high status, Gu Can, with his lack of regard for old feelings, could do anything heartlessly.

Lin Shouyi sat in the ancestral home, no matter how he tried to focus his mind, he remained restless. He could only head to the ancestral hall, where the divine tablets had already been moved to the capital of the Great Li, to find some peace.

Lin Shouyi lit three sticks of incense, respectfully paying homage to his ancestors.

After completing this, he turned to leave the ancestral hall, just as he was closing the door, he noticed an old scholar standing nearby.

Lin Shouyi, being extremely clever, immediately bowed, "Lin Shouyi from Mountain Cliff Academy, pays respects to Master Uncle."

Cui Zhan smiled, "I am no longer in the direct lineage of the Confucian Sage, so you need not be so polite."

Lin Shouyi straightened his back and bowed again, "A disciple of the Great Li Lin clan, pays respects to the National Master."

Cui Zhan nodded, "In your early years of wandering and studying, your performance was quite remarkable. You were the first to notice A Liang's extraordinary nature and the first to gain opportunities; it was all you, Lin Shouyi, and that was no small feat. Allowing that person to act within the great rules this time was a sign of your academic stability, the accumulation of experience, and a stroke of good fortune."

Cui Zhan led Lin Shouyi through the empty mansion, encouraging the young man to walk alongside him without being overly restrained.

Cui Zhan continued, "Your father has some burdens he will never discuss with you. He was the first to inform Chen Ping'an’s father about the inside story regarding the innate porcelain. Of course, it was out of goodwill, and he also mentioned the consequences to Chen Ping'an's father. The two became close friends despite their differences in status. Your father even helped that man clean up the mess later; otherwise, it would have been difficult for Chen Ping'an to survive. Thus, when Chen Ping'an later traveled to study, he gifted you the 'Mountain Search Map.' There are some fated connections at play here. However, your father, with good intentions, didn’t want you to be too involved with Chen Ping'an, fearing that you might be swept up in the greater tides of fate before you were ready, leading to an early demise. Thus, he acted very indifferent about your journey to the Great Sui Academy."

Lin Shouyi was taken aback.

Cui Zhan said, "Hard to believe? Then think carefully: a man who has served as the deputy for three kiln supervisors wouldn’t be simple, would he? Does he really care about the titles of legitimate or illegitimate sons? Do you know that the current Supervisor Cao, before heading to Huaihuang Town, visited only one person after leaving the late emperor’s study? That would be your father, who remains inconspicuous in the capital. How did your classmate Shi Chunjia's family manage to get through their hardships? Does Shi’s family not know? Are they still harboring some resentment? Do you think your father would care?"

Cui Zhan, with one hand behind his back and the other pinching his fingers as if plucking something, continued, "Shi Chunjia is sentimental, you too should be. If you remember, all your classmates will follow suit. Bian Wenmao has lofty aspirations but only sincerely treats his wife, Shi Chunjia, who comes from humble beginnings. You would understand Bian Wenmao's situation. Once this gentleman from the Great Li capital encounters troubles, you would be willing to help him. If you choose to assist, even if you are still inexperienced and make some blunders, your father will not sit idly by. All these threads are connected, and the web is vast. Just don't forget that if you can think this way, so can everyone else. Whatever level of cultivation one possesses will bring about corresponding karmic consequences. The realm of cultivation is usually useful but can be the least useful at critical times. Lin Shouyi, I ask you: do you still wish to meddle in others' affairs?"

Cui Zhan gently flicked his fingers, as if wiping clean those connections.

Lin Shouyi pondered for a moment before replying, "Since things have come to this, I must manage them one by one."

Lin Shouyi sighed, "But I will meddle less in the future."

Cui Zhan smiled knowingly, "Your father’s tantrums and tricks were not in vain; they helped me come up with such a good name for you."

Lin Shouyi suddenly halted, gathering his courage to bow again, trembling as he asked, "May I ask, Master Uncle, why did you stand by and let our teacher go to his death alone back then?"

This question made Lin Shouyi feel a deep sense of grievance he could no longer suppress. Even if it angered this National Master who did not wish to acknowledge his uncle status, today he had to ask!

Cui Zhan took it lightly, clearly not angered by the young man's audacity; instead, he appeared somewhat delighted as he said, "If you can speak grand principles without paying a great price, what value is there? Anyone can talk about it; what is the meaning of reading? When it comes to righteousness, it is foolish to yield to others. This kind of foolishness is hard to learn without studying. However, the teachings of Confucius are all laid out in plain books."

Cui Zhan gently patted the young man's shoulder, saying, "Thus, while living in the world, one should scold half-hearted scholars more and the sages less."

Cui Zhan looked around, "In your early years of wandering, your poor opinion of your father was noted by Chen Ping'an when he traveled with you. So, even if Chen Ping'an later had enough confidence to bring up old grievances, he would have uncovered many old records about the Ma family in Xinghua Alley. Yet, he stalled at the kiln supervision office with your father, precisely because he trusted you. He feared those rumors that couldn’t be spoken but also didn’t trust the hearts of those he had never met. Most feared that once the truth was revealed, it would cause your friend Lin Shouyi to be bloodied; this is called once bitten, twice shy. After experiencing hardships at Shujian Lake, he truly did not wish to face them again in his hometown."

Cui Zhan smiled, "Although Chen Ping'an misunderstood, it was a good thing. Otherwise, with his temper, once he got serious, even if he uncovered the truth and was able to breathe easily, avoiding you and your father, Down-and-Out Mountain would have early on clashed with the Song clan of the Great Li, suffering severe wounds. They would be stuck in their hometown, seeking answers, making enemies everywhere, naturally harming their vitality, and would never achieve any status as the hidden official of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The Xu family of Qingfeng City, along with many forces, would spare no effort in taking down Down-and-Out Mountain."

Cui Zhan continued, "You don't need to return to Mountain Cliff Academy for now. Inquire with Li Baoping and Li Huai about that 'Qi' character from years ago. Collect any that are still kept, including yours, and then go find Cui Dongshan, giving him all the 'Qi' characters. After that, visit Shujian Lake and retrieve those bamboo slips that Chen Ping'an threw into the lake."

Lin Shouyi was bewildered but still nodded in agreement.

Cui Zhan looked up at the grand sword light that had flashed by, relieved to see it finally leave.

The Great Li Dynasty was busy excavating the grand canal, with construction going on vigorously.

The influential Gongsun family, led by Liu Xunmei, had suddenly become the latest high-ranking figures in the Great Li.

As for the formerly low-profile governor of Qingluan Nation, Liu Qingfeng, once the initial excitement of the Great Li capital's officialdom passed, alongside some behind-the-scenes arrangements, Liu Qingfeng quickly lost people’s interest in probing further.

Coming from a scholarly family in a small nation, it was clear he was not a Qi practitioner and was destined for a short life. In his early years, he had some notable achievements in Qingluan Nation but was infamous, so sitting in this position might lead to some prospects but not great ones, as he was not from the Great Li capital. As for how he suddenly rose to prominence, who knows? In the Great Li capital, there was speculation that this person was merely a puppet raised by the Jiang family of Yunlin, especially since the latest mouth of the grand canal was right in front of the Jiang family’s door.

A very handsome young man in white squatted in the field, watching from a distance as a local clan fought over water rights, thoroughly captivated. Beside him squatted a frail child with a dull expression.

Liu Qingfeng sat on the field ridge, with his attendants Wang Yifu and the young Liu Suo standing at a distance. Liu Suo was not particularly afraid of the odd young man he had dealt with before; apart from being a bit dim-witted, there wasn't much to say about him. However, Wang Yifu advised Liu Suo to stay away from that "young man."

Liu Qingfeng turned his head towards the boy chewing on a wild grass stalk and asked, "Excavating the grand canal, big and small matters, it should be a step-by-step process. Teacher Cui doesn't need to stay here overseeing it, right?"

Cui Dongshan continued watching the scuffle, observing relatives fighting with shovels and carrying loads. Many of them were uncles and nephews, genuinely going at it, but after the fight, they would still remain relatives, possibly even needing to pay each other for medicine or treatment afterward, all sincere and heartfelt.

Hearing Liu Qingfeng's inquiry, he casually replied, "The grand canal named Qi is the reason."

Liu Qingfeng nodded with a smile, indicating he understood.

A carriage stopped on a rural road. From the carriage emerged Li Baozhen, walking over and bowing, "Teacher Cui."

Cui Dongshan ignored him.

Li Baozhen stood up and looked towards Liu Qingfeng, smiling, "Mr. Liu."

Liu Qingfeng smiled and gestured for him to sit down.

Li Baozhen sat beside Liu Qingfeng.

Cui Dongshan turned his head, jokingly saying, "Don’t let me hold you two back from reminiscing; I’ll find some fun for myself." He stood up, grabbed the child's collar beside him, and left with the wind.

Cui Dongshan quietly landed several hundred miles away in a mountain town, sitting side by side under the shade of a tree with the older brother, surrounded by crowds. They watched roadside wild chess for a good half an hour. It was not Go; the chessboard was simpler. Otherwise, common folks would not be able to attract so many spectators without having played at least half a game of chess.

When the wild chess player won a heap of copper coins and silvers, the crowd dispersed, and they planned to wrap up. This is what they called a one-trick pony. However, when he saw the young man still not willing to leave, observing him closely and appearing like a young master from a wealthy family, he smiled and asked, "Do you like to play chess?"

Cui Dongshan was eager to try, rubbing his hands, "Of course, I can play. I can play this chess, and I can even play Go. But I left home in a hurry, so I don’t have much copper on me. I see some tricks in your game; I’m sure I can win you."

The man playing wild chess laughed. This was one of the top ten wild chess games in the Jianghu, the "Earthworm Drawing the Dragon." He didn’t fear others figuring out the tricks; the more, the better; he was just afraid the opponent would find it unsolvable and not be willing to take the bait.

Cui Dongshan slapped the child's head beside him, "Hurry up and play chess to earn some money."

The man laughed heartily and swiftly packed up his stall, not wanting to engage with this young boy.

Cui Dongshan did not stop him, taking small steps to sit opposite the child. He stretched out his neck, staring at the child, then raised his hands, pulling at the child's cheeks, "How did I figure out you are a chess expert? I didn’t tell that man your surname, Gao."

The child remained expressionless.

Cui Dongshan tugged for a while, feeling it was pointless. He stood up, leading the child to wander around the town. They encountered a not-so-old young man from the capital, who had come to this vassal state to seek treasures, mostly a trusted apprentice from an antique shop owner in the capital, dispatched to places to seek rare treasures and valuable antiques.

Doing this job, one must have sharp eyes and solid character. Otherwise, if one were to stumble upon a priceless treasure, they would run off and establish their own business.

Cui Dongshan followed this young man around the market, weighing and closely inspecting the items he had quietly observed, causing the young man to grumble in frustration, "If you need money, I can give you some; just don’t keep following me around for fun. You think it’s amusing, but you’re ruining my livelihood."

Cui Dongshan looked at the young man’s eyes and expression, feeling inexplicably familiar. He suddenly smiled, "Don’t worry, I guarantee I won’t cause any trouble from here on out."

The young man was skeptical, but as they continued to walk around, the boy remained quiet, which only made the young man more anxious. Could it be that the dangers of the Jianghu were real, and the boy was indeed after him? 

The Jianghu was full of hidden dangers, making it hard to guard against. However, the boy casually bought a porcelain bowl, placing it on the child's head, and bid farewell to the young man, saying he needed to take his silly brother back to the school for a meal. After all, in a foreign land, seeking knowledge, the teacher was the most important; if the student didn’t return for long, the teacher would worry.

The young man let out a sigh of relief.

As the boy took the white bowl off the child's head, he tossed it at the young man from a distance, beaming, "I've learned some fresh tips on buying antiques from you; there's no need for thanks, this bowl is for you."

The young man had intended to refuse, thinking it was just a broken bowl—not worth it, and it would take up space. Moreover, the boy was dressed in finery, yet when he took out copper coins, he counted them one by one, not appearing to be well-off...

But before the young man could speak, the boy had already dragged the child away by an arm, running off quickly. The child looked rather pitiful as they fled.

As the sun set in the west, on a yellow clay road outside the city, houses of various sizes from a village squatted by a river.

Cui Dongshan muttered to himself, "The teacher's reluctance to help others stems from an incident in his youth; he fears being too rash in helping others in need. He thinks that the older Jianghu practitioners should be like this, but in reality, my teacher is too demanding of the Jianghu people."

"Doing good with bad intentions, which is worse? One must make a choice."

"But my teacher is wise, worrying about everything; how can a student dare to speak such things?"

As Cui Dongshan rambled on to himself.

A child herding cattle returned home, riding on the back of a cow.

Cui Dongshan was not to be outdone, jumping onto the child's back.

Cui Dongshan swayed his shoulders, causing the child to stumble along. He said, "Clouds drift in the sky, willows sway by the roadside, the sounds of hawkers selling apricot blossoms fill the streets."

Then, Cui Dongshan clapped the child’s cheek, "Little Gao, my poetic inspiration is surging! Join me in a verse!"

The child blinked.

Cui Dongshan increased his strength, threatening, "You won’t give me face?!"

The child mumbled, "In rural smoke, a herdsman rides a cow, playing the bamboo flute, singing the old peaceful song."

"Little Gao, you truly are a talent!" Cui Dongshan wrapped an arm around the child’s neck, using the other to pat the back of his head, laughing heartily, "What merit do I have to know you?!"

The herding boy turned to look at the two, frightened, and hurriedly urged his cow to quicken its pace.

Cui Dongshan covered the child’s eyes, "Gather your strength, run!"

Finally, with his vision obscured, the child stumbled forward, running straight into the river.

In mid-air, Cui Dongshan released his hands and waved vigorously, his large sleeves fluttering. Just as the two were about to hit the water, the boy laughed uproariously, "The wise enjoy water! Dongshan has come!"

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 774: The Central Martial Artist

Liu Xianyang truly only returned home for a visit. After his stay, he boarded the dragon boat named "Fan Mo" at Luoposhan. This boat didn't go directly to Old Dragon City; instead, it required a transfer at a celestial ferry near the Shuishui Kingdom in the central part of Baopingzhou, following the Longdao southward.

All the direct disciples from the Ancestor Hall of Zhu Chai Island had already relocated from Shujian Lake to the back of the Ao Fish, making it one of the earliest celestial forces to form an alliance with Luoposhan.

The former princess who once ruled with a veil, now the island owner Liu Chongrun, personally took charge of the ferry. It was hard to feel at ease knowing there wasn't a Earth Immortal sitting in on the boat.

Ruan Xiu was at the Niujiao Mountain ferry to see Liu Xianyang off.

The dragon boat was massive, akin to a mountain of gold and silver, which left Liu Xianyang feeling quite emotional. In the past, among the three of them, it was actually Chen Ping'an who wanted to make money the most, not Gu Can. However, unlike Gu Can, who had plans on how to spend the money he wanted to earn, Chen Ping'an was driven by fear of poverty. He needed to earn something every day; no matter how little, as long as his family fortune increased by even a single copper coin compared to yesterday, it could make his unstable days feel more secure, and make the stable days even more so.

During this trip home, Liu Xianyang mostly visited neighbors and friends, chatting with the elderly who remained in the small town. With each passing year, the elderly dwindled in number, and the children who once ran around in open-crotch pants were growing into adults, each with their own marriages. When they saw Liu Xianyang, they might not even recognize him. Those peers from his youth were busy doing business in the state city, so the opportunities Liu Xianyang had to engage in meaningful conversations were few, and it was destined to become even rarer in the future.

Now, in idle chats with the elderly, the likes of Xinghua Lane had become the topic of conversation, with Chen Ping'an, the major landowner who had bought up many hills in his hometown, and Song Jixin, who had mysteriously become a descendant of dragons. There was also Dong Shuijing, who was doing big business with the officials in the state city. These were the most discussed figures among the townsfolk.

Moreover, these elders who had endured hard times seemed particularly fond of praising the feng shui of Xinghua Lane and Niping Lane, claiming it was no worse than that of Fulujie and Taoye Lane.

Liu Xianyang enjoyed listening to the elders ramble about these mundane matters, especially when some of the elders who were not familiar with Niping Lane spoke of Chen Ping'an as if he were a younger relative they had watched grow up. It made Liu Xianyang feel quite pleased. Indeed, in terms of social interactions, especially with elders, Chen Ping'an had always been quite skilled. Though he usually didn't talk much, he would greet people he encountered on the road, never forgetting his manners, even if the other party ignored him. The next time they met, the boy from Niping Lane would still respectfully greet them.

Some people became suddenly rich due to luck and fortune, which was enviable but unattainable. Yet, some successes came from years of hard work and persistence, which seemed easy to learn but was often not.

Liu Xianyang waited for the dragon boat to dock, needing to unload and load cargo. Nowadays, the trade of dragon boats involved connections with the Pima Sect and Chunlu Garden from Beiju Luozhou, something unimaginable to many small-town folks.

Suddenly, Liu Xianyang smiled and asked, “That kid named Xie Ling from the mountain has quite an unusual appearance.”

There was more to his words than met the eye; this was a common way of speaking in the town.

Ruan Xiu responded, “He’s just a kid.”

Liu Xianyang felt a bit schadenfreude.

Ruan Xiu said, “You can't really control Gu Can.”

Liu Xianyang nodded and replied, “If it comes to it, I can just hit him once. Gu Can wouldn’t fight back, but he can't change his fundamentally spoiled nature. I’ve known this for a long time, so I never thought about how to manage him. At least this little brat still has a bit of conscience and knows who truly cares for him.”

Ruan Xiu and Liu Xianyang were old acquaintances. Liu Xianyang had actually entered that sword-forging shop by the Longxu River before Chen Ping'an and had been an apprentice, unlike Chen Ping'an, who later worked there as a temporary helper. Whether it was making porcelain or forging swords, Liu Xianyang seemed to adapt to local customs more quickly than Chen Ping'an. Liu Xianyang liked to pave the way and, when he found a path, he would pull Chen Ping'an along behind him.

On the journey of life, many people are willing to see their friends live well, but they may not want their friends to do better than themselves—especially not by a wide margin.

Liu Xianyang was not like that, nor was Chen Ping'an. This was probably why these two very different individuals could become true friends and, after both their lives had undergone tremendous changes, their friendship only grew stronger.

Ruan Xiu held a handkerchief and picked up a piece of peach blossom cake, asking, “Did you not go to Niping Lane to say hello and chat for a bit?”

Liu Xianyang sighed, “The youthful admiration is all bright and beautiful, but looking back, it’s just a fond memory.”

Once Liu Xianyang finished his sentiment, Ruan Xiu had already finished a piece of cake and picked up another almond pastry, saying, “What did you talk about with my father? He seemed quite happy.”

Liu Xianyang chuckled, “Master Ruan drank, and I scolded Chen Ping'an.”

Ruan Xiu responded with a soft “Oh.”

Liu Xianyang wasn’t exactly lying; there was indeed a serious matter he couldn’t discuss with Ruan Xiu. Years ago, after Chen Ping'an returned from a trip to sea, he had found Liu Xianyang and asked him to go back to his hometown to help convey a message to the Song family of the Great Li in Baopingzhou. Liu Xianyang felt it was more appropriate for Ruan Qiong, the chief devotee of the Great Li and his future master, to discuss matters with the young emperor. This was no small matter; it involved the Chuxian Chen family’s support for the Daxui Mountain Cliff Academy, returning to the ranks of the Seventy-Two Academies. However, the Linlu Academy built on Piyun Mountain by the Great Li was unfamiliar to the Chuxian Chen family and would not be discussed at the Confucian Temple.

At the time, Liu Xianyang had some doubts, so he asked openly why the Chuxian Chen family of the Yasheng lineage wanted to do this, without worrying about potential dissent within the Yasheng lineage.

His concern was not unfounded. A vice chief elder from the Middle Earth Confucian Temple, in terms of both realm and seniority, was on par with Chen Ping'an. To put it simply, Chen Ping'an was a renowned scholar and a pillar of the Yasheng lineage, but within the scholarly traditions of the Yasheng lineage, he was still bound by many constraints.

Chen Ping'an seemed to be in a good mood at the time, telling Liu Xianyang that this was a business deal between himself and Chen Ping'an. If Chen Ping'an relied solely on his identity as a disciple of the Literary Sage's lineage, daring to speak boldly to Chen Xun'an, it would be rather inappropriate. Ultimately, standing atop the stone cliffs by the great river, Chen Xun'an patted Liu Xianyang on the shoulder, saying something refreshing to the young man. He said that we scholars should not be ashamed to discuss interests; our hearts must aspire to lofty ideals, while our actions must be practical and substantial. Scholars should step out of their studies and be among the common folk, discussing principles that even those who have not read books can understand.

At that time, Liu Xianyang blurted out, “We scholars should not only associate with other scholars.”

The old man was greatly pleased, stroking his beard and smiling, “Our Chuxian Chen family’s family traditions and learning styles are quite commendable.”

Suddenly, Ruan Xiu said, “If you’ve already said you don’t care too much, then why take that underground river route? There are ferries that go directly to Old Dragon City, after all.”

Liu Xianyang rubbed his face with both hands and replied, “Back then, the small town was just that small. The pretty girls on Fulujie and Taoye Lane? I didn’t dare to think too much about them. She’s different; she’s Chen Ping'an’s neighbor, living in Niping Lane, and her family is not even as good as my ancestral home. She’s just the maid of the Song family, carrying water and cooking every day. I feel like I’m certainly not worthy of her. If I were to say how much I liked her, well, I do like her a lot, but it’s not to the extent of obsessing over her. Everything is left to fate. Whether we end up together or not, what difference does it make?”

Ruan Xiu asked, “What kind of place is the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Liu Xianyang thought for a moment, “It’s a place that lacks everything, except for a plethora of sword cultivators. In terms of cultivation, life or death doesn’t seem to be a significant matter there. So, there are many drinkers. Sword cultivators and sword immortals, after all, like to drink. I can even say that in my impression, the Sword Qi Great Wall is the place where the most high-level individuals seem the least like high-level individuals outside my hometown.”

Ruan Xiu nodded.

Liu Xianyang’s expression became awkward. After hesitating for a long time, he finally couldn’t help but say, “Ruan Xiu, I've known you for a long time, right? We have a pretty good relationship, don’t we? But there are some things I really can’t say much about. Chen Ping'an, you two are both my friends, so I can only try not to say those words you might want to hear regarding a certain matter.”

Ruan Xiu looked up at Liu Xianyang and shook her head, “I don’t want to hear those words you think I want to hear, like how Ruan Xiu is better than Ning Yao, or how you are a better friend to me than to Ning Yao.”

Liu Xianyang felt relieved and laughed, “Miss Ruan is just Miss Ruan, after all.”

Ruan Xiu said, “The reason I asked that was not just out of curiosity about what the Sword Qi Great Wall is like now but also to know how he is doing there. If he’s doing well because Ning Yao is there, since we are friends, of course, I would be happy.”

Just as Liu Xianyang was about to follow Ruan Xiu’s words and chat a bit more about how well Chen Ping'an was doing at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he suddenly stopped himself, silently warning himself not to say too much.

In a few years, when Liu Xianyang returns to his hometown again, he would rightfully become a direct disciple of the Dragon Spring Sword Sect. Regarding this matter, after Liu Xianyang ascended the mountain, Ruan Qiong had clearly explained it to both his direct and nominal disciples. However, Ruan Qiong did not mention whether Liu Xianyang would be ranked on the ancestral table after the first disciple Dong Gu or simply placed after Xie Ling. Liu Xianyang did not ask, and it became a topic of amusement among many nominal disciples of the Dragon Spring Sword Sect during their idle chats. The sect members were now quite familiar with the temperament of their sect leader. As long as they practiced swordsmanship sincerely and did not speak out of turn, there would be much speculation regarding Liu Xianyang’s cultivation level. After all, true Confucian disciples were not numerous among sword cultivators.

Ruan Xiu curiously asked, “Why do you still wish to return here to practice swordsmanship in the Dragon Spring Sword Sect? My father actually can’t teach you anything.”

Liu Xianyang replied helplessly, “Chen Ping'an is too good at taking care of others and not very good at taking care of himself. I worry when I’m far away.”

“I’m worried about Chen Ping'an,” Ruan Xiu softly repeated Liu Xianyang’s heartfelt words. She smiled, putting away her handkerchief into her sleeve. With her fingers, which had some cake crumbs on them, she gently pinched the edge of her sleeve, “Liu Xianyang, not everyone is qualified to say such things. Perhaps it was fine before, but it will be very difficult in the future.”

Liu Xianyang replied with a smile, “I’m worried about Chen Ping'an.”

Ruan Xiu smiled, narrowing her eyes, playing dumb.

At the Old Dragon City’s princely mansion, in the study.

On the desk lay several authentic historical texts from different dynasties, collections of literary masterpieces, and painting albums, with no celestial artifacts displayed as decoration.

Behind the desk stood four screens: one was an ancient map of the Great Li, another was a map of Baopingzhou, while the remaining two depicted the distribution of celestial sects in Tongyezhou and Beiju Luozhou.

Song Jixin, who had just returned from his northern homeland to the southern fief, sat alone in the study, shifting the direction of his chair to face the four screens.

With both hands, Song Jixin held a delicate heart-nourishing pot, gently spinning it. The inscription on the pot read "Shan Shao."

As he gently twisted the small pot in his hands, it was a precious item that had been lost and regained, returning to its rightful owner, though the means of recovery were not entirely honorable. However, Song Jixin didn’t care what Fu Nanhua would think.

Years ago, Fu Nanhua had entered the Li Pearl Cave, purchasing this small pot from Song Jixin with a bag of golden copper coins and an old dragon rain talisman. This transaction was actually quite fair; of course, Fu Nanhua had also managed to gain a significant advantage from it. Unlike many treasures from the mountains that were merely rank ornaments but were useless to Earth Immortal cultivators, this heart-nourishing pot was an extremely rare treasure of high rank, most suitable for Earth Immortals to cultivate their Dao hearts and nourish their Qi. Moreover, the pot contained a small cave, making it a compact item. Thus, after Fu Nanhua acquired it, he had someone verify it, feeling overjoyed and treasuring it deeply.

Yesterday, after reminiscing with the young prince, Fu Nanhua had mentioned this small pot, and today he had someone deliver it.

Song Jixin wasn’t truly coveting the heart-nourishing pot; it was more about this homecoming journey allowing the seemingly diligent but actually indifferent young prince to unknowingly regain a sense of ambition, finally beginning to see himself as the Great Li prince "Song Mu." This small pot, which had fallen back into his hands, was a reminder of the power dynamics below the mountains.

Since ancient times, celestial beings have looked down upon princes.

However, the current Great Li Dynasty was different; it had already suppressed, constrained, and intimidated all the mountain forces to the extent they could hardly breathe. No matter how powerful sects like the Shengaos and the Zhenjing Sect were, with their connections to other continents, in the small morning meetings in the emperor "Song He’s" imperial study, they still had to act like half-subjects, carefully observing others' expressions, sitting down obediently, and standing up dutifully.

Song Jixin casually tossed the invaluable small pot, alternating between catching it with both hands.

There were two confidential documents on the table, both of which Song Jixin had requested the copper men at the Penglu Terrace to collect. He completely distrusted the spies from the Green Wave Pavilion, because the original owner of the Green Wave Pavilion was the Great Li Empress, who was also Song Jixin’s biological mother. Although the Green Wave Pavilion and the Niujiao Lane both belonged to the National Master now, Song Jixin knew very well that many of the elderly who had not been eliminated from the Green Wave Pavilion knew how to navigate the delicate balance between the emperor Song He, the empress dowager, and the weak prince Song Mu.

On the other hand, the Penglu Terrace was the military’s unique intelligence agency, only listening to orders from the emperor’s uncle Song Changjing, and had never been interfered with by National Master Cui Zhan.

Song Jixin turned his head and glanced at the two documents. One was a detailed list of five-bound cultivators in Beiju Luozhou, while the other was a brief file regarding "Young Cui Dongshan."

The Fire Dragon Real Person from the Pile Peak, Li Yu from the Tai Xia lineage, had already perished. The Yuanling Hall of Zhixuan Peak was also affected, and fortunately, one of the individuals was merely at the Nascent Soul level; otherwise, the Fire Dragon lineage would have been far too intimidating.

Tianjun Xie Shi.

The Pima Sect’s head, Zhu Quan, alongside two old ancestors.

The Ghost Valley of Jingguan City, Gao Cheng.

There were Taoist temples and monasteries hidden within the peach forests, but the specifics of their foundations were currently unknown.

Fuping Sword Lake, female sword immortal Li Cai. She had already traveled far to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Taihui Sword Sect, head Han Huaizi, old ancestor Huang Tong, and new Jade Purity Realm sword immortal Liu Jinglong. Han Huaizi had also been at the Sword Qi Great Wall for many years.

The first sword immortal of the northern region, Bai Shang, the mentor of Xu Xuan.

Yuan Ti Mountain, Ji Yue, had perished in battle, exchanging lives with the tenth realm martial artist Gu You. This was a significant loss for the entire Beiju Luozhou.

Shuilong Sect, with the northern sect led by Sun Jie and the southern sect by Shao Jingzhi.

The head of the Qionglin Sect.

In the Great Source Dynasty, the Chongxuan Bureau's Yunjiao Palace was led by the Yang family head.

Qingliang Sect’s He Xiaoliang.

The whereabouts of the wild cultivator Huang Juran remained unknown.

In addition, there were many entities similar to the Taoist temples and monasteries in the peach forest, as well as numerous high-level individuals who lived in seclusion, making it extremely difficult for the Great Li Dynasty’s intelligence to penetrate deep into Beiju Luozhou to uncover the long-buried truths. There were also some secret histories regarding all the living and deceased sword immortals’ journeys at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As for Cui Dongshan, the Penglu Terrace only provided a blank page.

However, two pages of documents had been relayed from the Ministry of Justice to this study. One briefly explained where this person had previously appeared, lingered, and his words and actions. Most notably, his first appearance was in the still unshattered Li Pearl Cave. He then took the deceased prince of the Lu family and a girl named Xie Xie to the Great Sui Academy, where he clashed with the esteemed Gao family’s patron, Cai Jing, in the capital, creating a magnificent downpour of treasures. Later, he teamed up with Ruan Xiu to hunt down a bottleneck sword cultivator of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, successfully killing him on the borders of the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

The closing remarks on the first page of the Ministry of Justice’s file noted that this person had broken through extremely quickly, possessed numerous magical treasures, and had a rather strange temperament.

The second page was filled with detailed descriptions of those treasures.

Song Jixin withdrew his gaze and turned back to the four screens, pondering that the individuals from the mountain who frequented the prince’s mansion were a mixed bag, many of whom had concealed identities. If the other party did not reveal them, even Song Jixin would find it impossible to guess, including some secret worshippers from the Tongye Sect who had been hidden in Baopingzhou for many years, as well as the business manager of the Qionglin Sect in Baopingzhou.

At first, Song Jixin acted like a fool, trying his best to say appropriate words. However, upon reflection, he realized that what he had considered appropriate were actually the most inappropriate words, likely making many high-level outsiders who risked revealing their identities feel like conversing with this young prince was akin to talking to a cow.

Because all this time, Song Jixin hadn’t figured out what he truly wanted.

Reverting to the name Song He? Competing for the throne with his brother? Song Jixin had no interest in that, or rather, he feared treading the same path again; anyone who had read a few history books knew that fratricidal conflicts in royal families often resulted in numerous deaths. Whether it was the current emperor or the empress dowager, they were ultimately his closest relatives. Song Jixin realized that his life had been muddled and unclear, loving and hating others seemed difficult to be pure, and in the end, he would repay his debts to each one, be it Supervisor Song Yuzhang, neighbor Chen Ping'an, or maid Zhi Gui...

This couldn’t go on any longer.

Song Jixin tightened his grip on the heart-nourishing pot and suddenly stood up.

At the entrance of the study, Zhi Gui had actually been standing quietly for quite some time, and at this moment, she finally spoke, “Young Master, someone has been waiting to see you for a long time. It’s the eldest daughter of the Jiang family from Yunlin, Fu Nanhua’s nominal wife. Um, that girl looks a bit plump. But it’s just a high-level person using an illusion spell; her true appearance is okay.”

Song Jixin smiled and walked toward the door.

As he walked alongside her, Song Jixin quietly asked, “How much snake gallstone and golden copper do we need?”

Zhi Gui’s eyes brightened as she responded, “Young Master, of course, the more the better, just like the silver from years ago. However, these materials are now strictly regulated by the court, and the imperial treasury in the capital won’t casually release them.”

Song Jixin chuckled, “Don’t worry; I can find a trivial reason. I can make a deal with the Lord of the Southern Yue Mountain, using Fan Junmao as a pretext to try and secure half for you.”

Zhi Gui seemed surprised and stole a glance at Song Jixin, realizing that the young master was somewhat different now.

She continued to look around, not revealing any secrets.

Currently, in Baopingzhou, there were only a handful of figures she felt apprehensive towards, and there happened to be one who was the least desirable to provoke.

After Song Jixin left the study.

From behind the four screens emerged a young man in white clothing, and in the corner squatted a wooden, expressionless child who had not breathed throughout.

Cui Dongshan held a folding fan in one hand, lightly tapping his back with it, while in the other hand, he flipped his wrist, conjuring a brush, and began drawing circles on a screen, writing the names of several five-bound cultivators in Beiju Luozhou. Then he leaned over the table and flipped through the three pages of documents regarding himself, adding names to many entries of unnamed magical treasures listed on the two pages of the Ministry of Justice, and finally wrote on the blank page: “Cui Zhan is an old bastard; ask him if you don’t believe me.”

After finishing, he felt quite satisfied.

He waved his hand, beckoning Gao Laodi to come over. Cui Dongshan bent down and began drawing on the child’s face with his brush.

Without looking up, he smiled and said, “Maku Xuan, you’ve gotten used to not following rules, but one day, you’ll pay a big price for it.”

Maku Xuan revealed his form, leaning against the study door, “What kind of big price? Death, loss of the Dao? National Master, it’s fine if others don’t understand, being a frog at the bottom of a well. But how could you not know? I’m most afraid of that.”

Cui Dongshan finished his drawing, nodded, and said, “You say you’re not afraid of death, and I believe that. However, you don’t even understand the severity of entangled fates. What qualifications does a frog at the bottom of a well have to tell me whether they’re afraid or not? Just look at the Mulan flower matter; whose arrangement was that? I’m not scaring you. Just relying on a high realm doesn’t mean you’re capable. How many people can kill me? Even if you gain an extraordinary realm in the future, I can still make you worry for a thousand years, just by doing it casually. So, be smart and let me save some effort. Otherwise, when the day comes that you truly are scared, what benefit would that be for me? The fundamental principle of merit and learning is to avoid letting people make foolish mistakes, ensuring that those seeking benefits actually receive benefits.”

Maku Xuan nodded, “That makes sense.”

Cui Dongshan sat back in his chair, twirling his folding fan, and joked, “It hasn’t been long since I’ve been beaten up, so I decided to bully a poor beggar. What do you think—fun or not?”

Maku Xuan laughed, “Being able to bully a poor beggar today means there might be a chance to bully a wealthy man tomorrow. People must have some aspirations; otherwise, why not just live as a beggar for a lifetime?”

Cui Dongshan suddenly realized, vigorously nodding, “That makes sense.”

Maku Xuan clasped his fists, “I hope to continue hearing the National Master’s teachings in the future.”

After Maku Xuan left, Cui Dongshan leisurely swayed his fan, feeling quite content, with four large characters written in running script on the fan: “To win hearts through virtue.”

Cui Dongshan extended a finger and casually waved it, seemingly writing something as he gleefully said, “Three inches of vertical strokes, a thousand fathoms high. A single white line, a long rainbow piercing the sky…”

Turning around, he looked at the child silently standing by the desk, “Whose child is this? So handsome.”

The entire face of the child, covered in scribbles, suddenly spoke, “Sir, I want to learn chess.”

Cui Dongshan rolled his eyes, “Teach you boxing and stepping, starving the master. What benefit would I gain from teaching you chess?”

The child replied, “I can accompany you to play chess.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head, not giving an answer, only saying something confusing: “Lost hairpin and old sword, will surely return one day.”

Carving a boat to seek a sword is not foolish, nor is it laughable to be worried like Qi people.

Cui Dongshan began to close his eyes to rest.

The child started to daydream.

Half an hour later, Song Jixin returned to the study alone, while Zhi Gui mentioned wanting to stroll around the city.

Upon seeing the white-robed young man occupying the space, Song Jixin halted his steps, then continued forward, choosing a chair to sit down. “Cui Xiansheng, you really are quite at home here.”

Old Dragon City was not a place where cultivators could act as if it were a lawless land.

Cui Dongshan opened his eyes and asked, “Do you know who I am?”

Song Jixin nodded, “I have some guesses.”

Cui Dongshan tapped his shoulder with his fan, “Gao Laodi, tell him who I am. I’m afraid he might guess wrong.”

The child recited accurately, “My master is Dongshan.”

Cui Dongshan suddenly burst into laughter, almost tipping his entire chair over.

Then he abruptly restrained his expression, standing up.

Under the pressure of his imposing aura and invisible pull, Song Jixin involuntarily stood up as well.

Cui Dongshan said solemnly, “At this point, I won’t baffle you any longer. I am Cui Dongshan, and that Cui Zhan is the most incompetent of my nominal disciples.”

Song Jixin bowed and said softly, “Why must you belittle yourself, National Master?”

Cui Dongshan used his hand as a fan, a gentle breeze brushing against his face, “What can relieve worries? Only self-deprecation.”

The three pages of documents on the table turned to ashes, scattering with the wind.

Cui Dongshan walked around the table, approaching a nearby windowsill, and said softly, “Qing Jingchun has high expectations for you. Why haven’t you taken it seriously over the years?”

Song Jixin remained silent.

Cui Dongshan sighed, “Song Jixin, do you know that with your kind of fate, in many novels, you’d be either the first character to appear at the beginning or the last at the conclusion? Why can’t you just strive a bit harder? Your brain isn’t working well? Look at that Maku Xuan from Xinghua Lane, bringing along a cat. You’re even more impressive, taking along a Wang Zhu before you set out, and adding in that Xie Ling from Taoye Lane, your own ancestors could walk out from the first few pages of the genealogy. People like you are all destined to be little heavenly deities!”

Song Jixin’s expression darkened. What in the world was this all about?

The white-clad youth lifted his head, pretending to cry, seemingly feeling the atmosphere was lacking, and snapped his fingers.

The child Gao Laodi understood the cue and began to sing a cheerful little tune about how delicious stinky tofu was.

In Cui Dongshan's view, a person could live in two ways. One was to be rewarded by heaven with food, having minor worries without major concerns, living comfortably day by day. The other was to be favored by ancestors, having a skill to rely on, not worrying about the winds, sun, or rain. With money, one could eat candied hawthorns, enjoy stinky tofu, and savor both in one hand, one bite after another.

The young prince stood there, unsure of what to think.

Outside the gate of the Ancestor Hall on Jise Peak, a grand martial arts conference was being held. To show importance, a table and four long benches were set up, filled with fruits and pastries.

Of course, the door of the Ancestor Hall wasn’t casually opened, nor could things just be brought outside, so the tables and benches were specially transported from the ancestral mountain of Luoposhan.

All those present were now leaders of the Donghua Mountain branch under the Dragon Spring Sect.

Pei Qian, the branch leader, sat in the main seat, back facing the door of the Ancestor Hall, arms crossed. In front of her stood a wooden plaque, the alliance token of the Dragon Spring Sect, which had been kept by Bao Ping for many years.

Recently promoted to deputy branch leader, the right protector Zhou Mili was present, along with the branch's offering, Chen Nuanshu. However, Chen Lingjun was absent, and Pei Qian had already noted this in the ledger.

The girl in a pink skirt, who held the keys to all the doors of Luoposhan, and the little girl in black, carrying a golden shoulder pole and a green bamboo staff, sat side by side on a long bench.

Li Huai, the little branch leader of a certain academy under the branch, was squeezed among Liu Guanhua and Ma Lian on a long bench. Liu Guanhua and Ma Lian were not only classmates at the Daxui Mountain Cliff Academy but also good friends from the same academy. Liu Guanhua was a descendant of the Han clan, while Ma Lian came from a prominent family in the Great Sui. The Ma family was even related by marriage to the Gao family of the Great Sui, and both Liu Guanhua and Ma Lian were highly regarded as seeds of the Great Sui in the academy.

There was also the recently promoted right protector of Qilong Lane, a small person from the former Mantou Mountain and later the Longzhou City Hall, who had been allowed to sit at the table due to his small stature, giving him the rare opportunity to face the branch leader directly.

The left protector of Qilong Lane was slumped beneath the long bench.

As the leader of the martial arts alliance, the head of the main sect was Li Baoping. The honorary head of the branch, the Great White Goose Cui Dongshan, was absent from this meeting.

Pei Qian cleared her throat, scanning the crowd, and said, “I’ve gathered you all today to discuss three serious matters… Zhou Mili, put the sunflower seeds back. Liu Guanhua, sit properly.”

The little girl quietly set down the handful of sunflower seeds she was holding. Liu Guanhua reluctantly sat up straight.

The branch leader was indeed stern, showing no favoritism.

Pei Qian proceeded with the three matters. The first was to announce some rules for the branch, all fundamental principles of navigating the martial world, which Pei Qian had copied from martial arts novels, mainly revolving around her master’s teachings. For example, having a skill was the foundation for a martial person, acting with righteousness was the martial ethics expected, and how to discern right from wrong, break through obstacles accurately, and end matters without flaws were things that a true hero needed to contemplate. When encountering injustice, one must shout, but that alone isn’t enough.

The next matter involved a series of changes and promotions within the branch.

Lastly, she was about to go to Beiju Luozhou with Li Huai, marking the first serious venture down the mountain for the branch. Therefore, they needed to pool their experiences of navigating the martial world, with Chen Nuanshu responsible for taking notes, which would later be compiled into a book, ensuring everyone would have a copy in the future.

After discussing the serious matters, Pei Qian waved her hand, “Time for sunflower seeds!”

The atmosphere on Jise Peak was lively and cheerful.

Accompanied by the great winds and flying birds above, the cross-continent ferry of the Pima Sect smoothly docked at the Bone Beach ferry. There were two named offerings from Luoposhan, along with the sect leader Zhu Quan, stationed at the Qinglu Town of Ghost Valley: the Nascent Soul cultivator Du Wensi and the direct descendant sword cultivator Pang Lanxi from Mu Yi Mountain. Chen Lingjun, holding his hiking staff and carrying a bamboo box, stepped off the ferry. Many cultivators who had traveled south to explore Baopingzhou finally returned home, bustling and noisy, leading to disputes with several ferry cultivators, which left Chen Lingjun wide-eyed. The martial artists from Beiju Luozhou were indeed as renowned as they claimed, brimming with heroic spirit and quite generous. If this were in his own Niujiao Mountain ferry, how many would have been knocked down by the Dragon Spring Sect and the Great Li cultivators?

Chen Lingjun first visited the increasingly deserted Mural City, purchasing a set of the Goddess painting as a gift for the Pima Sect. The expenses had already been pre-paid by the Luoposhan Ancestor Hall, but Chen Lingjun didn’t use a single snowflake coin from that small treasury. For jokes, would Chen Da-ge lack that little bit of money? Back in the days when he was roaming the Jiang territory, his pockets jingled with the sound of celestial coins clinking together, like thunder. However, upon arriving in Dragon Spring County, Chen Da-ge had become a bit kinder to others; otherwise, with his fiery temper… he would have likely killed someone with a punch long ago.

Sometimes, the whimsical thoughts of Chen Lingjun made him wish that every qi cultivator in the world should reside in small towns for a while, humbly seeking advice on martial experiences.

Within the solemn Pima Sect, the sect leader Zhu Quan didn’t make an appearance, and neither did the two elders. One had been traveling for many years, while the other, the law elder Yan Su, had been busy reinforcing the mountain protecting formation with the elder from Middle Earth who came to the Pima Sect. Pang Lanxi was in seclusion, and Du Wensi was still at Qinglu Town dealing with those skeletons. Not seeing any familiar faces, Chen Lingjun grumbled about his master’s lack of stature, feeling rather disappointed that there wasn’t even a welcoming feast thrown by the sect leader to honor him. He had to maintain a demeanor as someone who had seen the world while cautiously glancing around. Years ago, at the blacksmith shop in the small town, he had nearly fallen for Ruan Qiong’s tricks, disguised as a farmer. Wasn’t that just blatant trickery? So, he felt it would be prudent to take it easy on this trip.

After greeting and receiving Chen Lingjun, the one welcoming him was a man named Wei Yusong, who was quite amiable, claiming to be the accountant who daily dealt with grievances and had the least persuasive speech. Chen Lingjun felt he had met a kindred spirit, yet he constantly reminded himself not to easily call anyone brother during this trip. Along the way, Chen Lingjun had flipped through many books, mostly about the precautions in treacherous mountainous areas. For the Pima Sect and Chunlu Garden, which his master had visited and formed ties with, he hadn’t looked closely at them. At this moment, he found Wei Yusong quite agreeable, a suitable candidate for executing important tasks. Chen Lingjun hurriedly took the chance to temporarily cling to a lifeline, secretly pulling out a booklet from his master and flipping to the section on the Pima Sect. Sure enough, he found Wei Yusong mentioned, noted by his master as a very good businessman, considered the financial god of the Pima Sect, reminding Chen Lingjun to respect him when he met him and to avoid speaking loosely.

Since he learned that the other party was a significant figure managing the sect’s finances, Chen Lingjun quickly grasped the situation. In a celestial sect, there are three types of people not to provoke: those managing sect rules, who surely are formidable; those managing finances, who won't be easy to deal with; and lastly, the young descendants of the Ancestor Hall.

After bidding farewell to Wei Yusong and refusing his invitation, Chen Lingjun set off down the mountain alone. On the way, he encountered an ordinary-looking woman who seemed to gaze at him strangely. Chen Lingjun felt a bit uncomfortable; he wasn’t Wei Bo, so why was she staring? The woman, lacking in perception, followed Chen Lingjun all the way to the foot of the mountain. At the gate, when that woman, wearing a knife at her waist, introduced herself as Zhu Quan, Chen Lingjun’s knees buckled, and he nearly lost his balance.

Zhu Quan smiled, saying, “Wei Bo has already sent a letter via flying sword to Mu Yi Mountain. If you encounter any trouble during your travels, you can report on behalf of the Pima Sect's Zhu Quan. It might not guarantee your life, but it will surely help you take revenge. Of course, it’s best if there’s no trouble. However, it will be quite difficult; if we wander through Beiju Luozhou without encountering a pile of trouble, what kind of experience would that be?”

Chen Lingjun trembled as he expressed his thanks. Zhu Quan waved her hand, and after he bid farewell, she suddenly asked, “When will Chen Ping'an return from the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Chen Lingjun shook his head, “I’m not too sure. My master never gives a precise time of return when he travels.”

Zhu Quan glanced at Chen Lingjun’s bamboo box and hiking staff, laughing, “You all from Luoposhan travel the martial world dressed like this?”

Chen Lingjun nodded vigorously.

Zhu Quan suddenly sighed, “I somewhat envy that guy’s… freedom.”

Chen Lingjun didn’t understand the bizarre words of these high-level figures hidden in the clouds, but he could at least tell that this renowned female sect leader held a rather good impression of his master. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have specifically returned from Ghost Valley to Mu Yi Mountain just for him. Generally, celestial beings from the mountains value equality and propriety, with complex rules. The fact that Wei Yusong treated him well was already quite gratifying.

A sect leader at the fifth realm, still daring to tussle with Gao Cheng from Ghost Valley for so many years, was indeed a remarkable woman. After leaving Mu Yi Mountain, Chen Lingjun walked with a slight bounce in his step.

Following the planned route, Chen Lingjun boarded a ferry from Chunlu Garden heading to the eastern sea entrance of Jidu. The ferry operator was Jin Dan cultivator Song Lanqiao, who had now secured a position in the Chunlu Garden Ancestor Hall. After visiting Song Lanqiao, Chen Lingjun was treated with excessive courtesy. Not only was he directly arranged in a top-tier guest room, but Song Lanqiao also personally accompanied him for a long chat. In their conversation, besides the genuine warmth he felt for Chen Ping'an and Luoposhan, his humility also put Chen Lingjun in a more awkward position.

Now, Luoposhan, Piyun Mountain, Pima Sect, and Chunlu Garden had formed alliances. Among them, Wei Yusong and Tang Xi from Pima Sect were responsible for the various matters. Song Lanqiao and Tang Xi were allies, and to become a member of the Chunlu Garden Ancestor Hall, they owed their thanks to the young sword immortal Chen Ping'an. What’s more, the latter was also the mentor of Song Lanqiao’s own mentor, and they had an affinity. Song Lanqiao had almost never met his own master, yet his unrelenting thoughts on an outsider had gone beyond mere relations.

The farther Chen Lingjun traveled from home, the more he missed it.

Everyone missed it, even the old blind Daoist who had been cultivating on Huang Lake would often think of it.

During the farewell from the ferry, Wei Bo had said that for cultivators, using techniques to kill or pressing people with power was not too difficult; the challenge lay in winning the hearts of others.

It was the first time Chen Lingjun carefully reviewed the contents he had previously overlooked. Then he went to the observation deck, leaning against the railing, gazing blankly. The bright moon hung high in the sky, half-hidden behind the sea of clouds, appearing both far and near, as if the ferry could crash into it with just a slight change of direction, just like a traveler passing through an archway.

Whether his master was in Luoposhan made a significant difference, which Chen Lingjun had sensed long ago. 

Only by leaving Luoposhan and embarking on this journey could he understand why it felt different and what made it different.

When living with his master, it was easy to overlook his realm and status. But as Chen Lingjun walked along the paths his master had once walked, he discovered that the boy from Niping Lane he had reluctantly followed back then had indeed changed and become quite formidable.

Chen Lingjun collected his thoughts, packed his belongings, greeted Song Lanqiao, and then midway left the ferry, heading to Sui Jia City, straight to the Fire God Temple.

Under the secret planning of the Dragon King of Cangjun Lake, the Fire God Temple, which had once fallen into ruin, was rebuilt. The local government spent heavily to recreate a painted statue, and the incense offerings were abundant. Chen Lingjun chose to visit late at night, respectfully knocking on the door. Upon seeing the man, who appeared to have a low realm, Chen Lingjun presented many celestial wines. The man, upon revealing his true self, was quite pleased; however, when it came to matters concerning Chen Ping'an, he didn’t ask a word.

Chen Lingjun felt that this older brother suited his taste; he was very much like him, brimming with the spirit of the martial world!

Thus, both sides drank, without needing any persuasion.

Not only had his master noted this in books and documents, but he had also specifically reminded Chen Lingjun verbally that this local deity was a friend of his and owed him a drink.

On the side of Cangjun Lake, upon receiving the report from the Fire God Temple’s priest, the Dragon King, Yin Hou, immediately rushed over at night without bringing any confidants. For a lake king whose domain encompassed the entire Sui Jia City, this was just a few extra steps in his own courtyard.

Seeing the rosy-faced child, who was flailing his hands and legs while chatting, the lake king was momentarily stunned. How did the Chen sword immortal come to have such a friend?

Just a meal, and they both felt satisfied.

However, after Yin Hou arrived, the man from the Fire God Temple treated him with respect but was not particularly enthusiastic, while he enjoyed drinking with Chen Lingjun.

In the morning, Chen Lingjun departed from the Fire God Temple and visited the Golden Crow Palace, paying a visit to the Golden Core bottleneck sword cultivator, Liu Zhiqing.

He was again treated with great courtesy, respectfully escorted to the mountain where Liu Zhiqing was in closed-door cultivation.

When Chen Lingjun saw Liu Zhiqing, the handsome young man’s celestial demeanor, adorned with a golden hairpin and clad in a snow-white long robe, made it seem as if all the renowned mountains and rivers in the world were waiting for such a cultivator’s visit.

Liu Zhiqing smiled and inquired if Chen Lingjun wanted tea. Chen Lingjun declined repeatedly. Liu Zhiqing didn’t insist; in fact, there wasn’t much for them to discuss. Liu Zhiqing was not one of those adept at socializing among mountain cultivators. The two exchanged polite words; when Chen Lingjun had nothing to say, Liu Zhiqing didn’t press him to stay longer. As Chen Lingjun stood up to leave, Liu Zhiqing offered to see him to the foot of the mountain. Chen Lingjun realized this person was in closed-door cultivation, so he hurriedly rejected the offer, dashing down the mountain. Upon reaching the foot of the mountain, when the palace master awaited him, Chen Lingjun also refused the banquet invitation, expressing his apologies, gratitude, and promising to meet again, all in one breath, growing increasingly adept.

Afterward, he went to Chunlu Garden without taking the celestial ferry again.

After all, it was his nature to be close to water. Chen Lingjun chose a common boat, sailing through the painted landscape, amidst the calls of monkeys on both banks, as he visited the myriad mountains.

Upon reaching the territory of Chunlu Garden, Chen Lingjun didn’t rush to find his acquaintance Song Lanqiao to chat but instead followed the atlas, first strolling along the scenic spots of the river entering the sea, then going to Chunlu Garden to explore Yuying Cliff. After that, he visited the Ant Shop established by his master, which was well-run by the steward, thriving with business. Chen Lingjun worked there as a shop assistant for two days.

That night, the entire Chunlu Garden suddenly held a sword festival.

The entire place lit up brightly, and Chen Lingjun quickly opened the shop, looking up to see the bustling street below. It was said that a sword immortal had fallen at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Far away from his hometown, Chen Lingjun thought of the master who was even farther away and sat on the threshold, resting his chin on his hands, his expression dim.

On the southern battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the golden river appeared for the third time.

A young man carried a sword box filled with borrowed swords from the sword shop.

Chen Ping'an stood atop the city wall, gazing at the battlefield momentarily. In a single step, he leaped down, plunging towards the ground. During the descent, he rolled up his sleeves. Just as he was about to land, he slightly bent his knees, stepping on the void. As he shot forward, the ground erupted beneath him, creating a massive pit, rumbling from deep within.

He didn’t ride the sword but instead rode the wind.

Like an arrow, he suddenly soared over a hundred feet away from the city wall, pressing down on the heads of two demon cultivators, effortlessly pushing their decaying corpses away.

When Chen Ping'an floated to the ground, all the sword cultivators around instinctively vacated the area, automatically making way for the young hidden official who was going out for the third time to kill.

The Sword Qi Great Wall no longer bore any traces of resentment, for the young hidden official was originally a sword cultivator, and he could kill even more effectively.

A martial artist from the demon clan, clad in heavy armor and wielding a spear, charged straight at him. The young hidden official advanced in a straight line, casually smashing the spear with his head, shattering the opponent's body with a punch. When he stepped heavily on the ground, his fists were not yet raised, but the intent of his punches surged forth.

Within a dozen feet around Chen Ping'an, the intent of his punches flowed like a raging tide. Furthermore, a second, even larger punch aura emerged from afar, stirring vigorously, with layers of punch frames and divine intent, radiating like overlapping halos of the moon.

In the center stood the martial artist, at the peak of his power. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 775: A Sparrow in a Cage

Chen Ping'an journeyed southward alone, and wherever he went, spells and spiritual artifacts poured down like a torrential rain.

It wasn't long before he encountered a formidable opponent—a short man clad in resplendent crimson armor, wearing a phoenix-winged golden crown adorned with two long peacock feathers, reminiscent of the flamboyant costumes seen in the bustling theaters of the world. 

Only someone unafraid of death, or perhaps qualified to be unafraid, would dare to flaunt themselves on the battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall. This practitioner of the demon race was exceptionally swift, almost as if using a teleportation spell, appearing at Chen Ping'an's side in an instant. With a single fist, he shattered the dense martial intent protecting Chen Ping'an, striking him directly on the temple and sending him flying dozens of yards.

Chen Ping'an slapped the ground with his palm, performing a graceful spin before standing firmly. The opponent, like a shadow, mirrored his movement and exchanged a punch with him.

Both combatants slid backward nearly simultaneously, carving a trench in the earth that barely reached their knees. The demon warrior shook his right wrist, removed a feather with two fingers from his left hand, and spoke in the local dialect of the Sword Qi Great Wall, "You must be the new Hidden Official? Have you stepped into the realm of martial arts? Your punches pack quite a wallop; no wonder you lost three times to Cao Ci before winning three against Yu Juanfu."

He raised his right hand, signaling the surrounding demon army to step back and leave the battlefield to himself and the young Hidden Official from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping'an gave a thumbs-up, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, then rubbed his temple with his palm. The force behind that blow was considerable; his opponent was likely at the Mountain Peak realm among demon warriors, relying on a naturally resilient physique, making him harder to deal with. Yet, as a ninth-tier warrior, equipped with martial luck, he shouldn't have been this reckless. The way he dressed and fought was far too "carefree."

Understanding quickly, Chen Ping'an took the unusual step of speaking with his adversary on the battlefield. "Are you the strongest eighth-tier warrior from the wild world? Looking for a chance to break through and gain martial luck?"

The short man let go of the feather in his hand, which bounced up, and he nodded with a smile. "What do you say? How about a friendly spar? If I say no, no one will believe me. I can’t guarantee that some sneaky sword cultivator assassins won’t join in, but it’s fine—just give me your nod, and anyone who interferes, including you, will be my enemy, and I’ll deal with them all."

Chen Ping'an extended a hand, pointing toward the Sword Qi Great Wall. "Inside the city, there's a senior in the ninth realm who taught me some boxing techniques. You can go ask him."

The short man's expression darkened; he had shown sincerity, yet this highly reputed young Hidden Official was proving to be quite unreasonable.

Chen Ping'an continued, "Let me put it to you this way: as a martial artist, no matter who you lose to—even if it's Cao Ci—there’s no such thing as losing with honor. A loss is a loss. This shows that the strongest wandering realm martial artist from the wild world, regardless of how tough his fists may be, lacks the spirit and ambition expected of a martial artist. If you are to be called 'the strongest' and step into the ninth realm, that would be a huge joke."

Their exchange bore little substance.

Each was calculating their own interests. The short man feigned bravado, wanting to use the young Hidden Official as a stepping stone for his martial path. Should he succeed in breaking through, he could gain not only the martial luck from the wild world but also a portion of the martial luck legacy from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

As for Chen Ping'an, he was secretly searching for the first swordsman of the wild world. Previously, the Three Teachings Sage had cultivated the golden river twice, and after two encounters outside the city, Chen Ping'an had crossed paths with that individual. Their exchanges had appeared tentative, as if neither was using their full strength, but the subtleties intertwined. The first one to slip would be the one to perish, and death would come in ways too unremarkable to impress the observing sword cultivators of lower realms.

The short man seemed to lose interest in their mental sparring, lightly kicking the gravel beneath his boots. "We can chat standing up, but soon, I’ll give you the chance to lie down and talk. By the way, I’m called Hou Kuimen."

Chen Ping'an rested his hand on his back, slightly turned his head, and pointed to his temple, indicating he was ready for another punch.

An idea struck him; it was time to test the waters. The precondition for this was to let his opponent have a go first.

Hou Kuimen, of course, was not polite.

After throwing a punch, Hou Kuimen hesitated for a moment, choosing not to pursue the advantage. He stood still, watching the young man he had just sent flying. 

The young man, who hadn't dodged or countered, landed heavily on the ground, stopping his momentum, and smiled back at Hou Kuimen, a hint of mockery in his expression.

Hou Kuimen had just been wary of a trap, so he had held back a little.

A young Hidden Official renowned for his cunning wouldn’t be foolish enough to just stand there and let himself be killed.

Thus, after his successful punch, he felt a twinge of regret. If that punch had not been simply a probe but a full-force strike, would that young man still be standing?

But why had his opponent taken that punch head-on?

Chen Ping'an pointed to his chest. "Again."

Hou Kuimen raised both arms, his fingers gripping the feathers. His attire, the bright crimson armor, the golden crown, and the two shimmering feathers, were not ordinary mountain artifacts but a complete set of ancient treasures. After refinement, they had changed appearances, but their quality remained intact—a semi-divine weapon, both offensive and defensive, named the Sword Cage, capable of restraining a sword immortal's flying sword for a moment. Without their life-sustaining flying sword, sword immortals were forced to compete based on physical ability when approached.

Hou Kuimen released the two feathers, and with a flash, he appeared in front of the young man who sought death, extending his fist. The young Hidden Official was sent tumbling away.

Chen Ping'an stood up, spitting out blood, and shot a glance at Hou Kuimen, cursing under his breath in his hometown dialect.

He had intended for this eighth-tier peak warrior to help him break through the seventh-tier bottleneck, yet Hou Kuimen had been sluggish in both his punches, making Chen Ping'an, who was used to the weight of Li Er's fists on Lion Peak in North Ju Lu Prefecture, feel as if he had just received two slaps from a woman.

Now, the Sword Qi Great Wall was circulating a fair saying: whether watching the young Hidden Official strike or being struck, it was always a delightful sight.

Hou Kuimen's expression was complex.

Chen Ping'an inquired in the refined dialect of the wild world, "Are you trying to kill the Hidden Official for merit, or are you here to spar with a martial artist to break through?!"

Hou Kuimen took a deep breath, lightly tapping his fists together, and said solemnly, "The last punch—if you don’t die, I lose. Chen Ping'an, I know you have your own ambitions too. It’s fine; let’s see whose boxing skills are superior! You can just counter."

Chen Ping'an furrowed his brows.

Vaguely, Hou Kuimen's overwhelming martial intent coalesced around him, creating a hazy atmosphere akin to a sage presiding over a small world.

Years ago, at the Shujian Lake, during his travels with Zhang Ye of Qingxia Island, Chen Ping'an had already noticed he could catch glimpses of such signs.

He shook out his sleeves, rolling them up lightly.

In that instant.

On the battlefield, dust swirled, obscuring the sky and blocking the sun.

The swirling sand was mixed with the piercing martial intent that shot out in all directions, chaotic like countless tiny flying swords scattering.

Moments later, the earth trembled, and the sand dispersed, revealing Hou Kuimen clutching his neck with one hand, blood seeping between his fingers, while the other hand formed a fist, glancing around.

Finally, Hou Kuimen spotted a demon race practitioner behind him, as the young Hidden Official’s left hand plunged a short knife into the back of a sword cultivator’s heart, while his right hand gently swept across their neck.

Hou Kuimen could hardly articulate, his voice slurred, "Chen Ping'an, I’ve personally experienced your abilities as a Hidden Official, but as a pure martial artist, I’m truly disappointed—so very disappointed."

It turned out that during their previous spar, the young Hidden Official had taken Hou Kuimen's punch head-on but had drawn a knife from his sleeve, stabbing upwards directly into Hou Kuimen's neck. Not only that, but with a swift motion of his left hand, he had slammed the knife's handle, forcing Hou Kuimen—had he not stomped and lifted himself up, then retreated a few steps—to nearly have his tongue sliced by the blade before it could have punctured his skull.

If he were a pure martial artist from the wild world, without a naturally resilient physique to support him, being thus injured would have rendered him incapable of uttering a single word.

Chen Ping'an gently pushed aside the corpse of the sword cultivator behind him, gathering sound into a line, and smiled at Hou Kuimen. "In your three punches, which one was worthy of a pure martial artist? If your first punch had been pure enough, I wouldn’t have minded exchanging three punches with you. Who knows, we might even break through together—that would be a true contest of life and death, solely dependent on skill."

After Chen Ping'an made his appearance, a large space opened up on the battlefield.

The young Hidden Official gripped his short blades with both hands, loosening and then firmly grasping them again.

This was a small habit he had learned from Yu Lu. As for the posture of holding the blades, it was inspired by a knife-wielding stance he had observed at the Sword Water Mountain Villa in the Shuishui Kingdom. Indeed, in the world below, assassins and knife-fighters also employed this stance, but to Chen Ping'an, it seemed insufficient—merely a lifeless form.

Hou Kuimen, knowing only the young Hidden Official from the Sword Qi Great Wall, was unaware of Chen Ping'an's habits in combat.

When he began to act hesitantly, it was surely in pursuit of some follow-up.

Otherwise, all words would only come after life and death had been decided.

Hou Kuimen did not retreat; instead, his martial intent intensified. Good.

Chen Ping'an sheathed the dual blades he had taken from the assassin at the Deer Cutting Mountain in North Ju Lu Prefecture, standing his ground.

Hou Kuimen, employing some secret technique, halted the blood flow from his neck, his arms hanging down, completely motionless.

This was the true essence of a martial artist's spar, the mindset that should be present.

After that, wherever the two figures went, it was bound to bring calamity upon the fish in the pond.

The two pure martial artists, each at their martial bottlenecks, were like two flying swords, cutting through the battlefield recklessly, leaving behind a trail of dismembered limbs and corpses.

As Hou Kuimen’s punches became increasingly “light,” the weight of his martial intent grew heavier.

Every strike bore the essence of a ninth-tier warrior, signaling a momentous opportunity for breakthrough.

For reasons unknown, the young Hidden Official, widely recognized as a sword cultivator, had yet to summon his flying sword, not even touching any of the blades in his sword case behind him.

Far across the battlefield, a “middle-aged man” who was a comrade of the young Hidden Official seemed swept along by the demon army, advancing toward the Sword Qi Great Wall. He had been keeping a close eye on the clash between Chen Ping'an and Hou Kuimen, sensing some underlying hints. He hesitated, contemplating whether to disrupt Chen Ping'an’s plans.

However, after scanning a few locations and weighing the distance, he chose to refrain from intervening, unwilling to compete for military merit with the talented figures at the Jia Shen camp.

Hou Kuimen, bloodied and battered, a dignified eighth-tier peak warrior adorned with precious treasures, found himself in an utterly inconceivable situation against a younger warrior of a lower tier.

Standing there, covered in blood, Hou Kuimen suddenly halted, chuckling softly to himself, raising his head to fixate on the equally startled young man who had just retracted his fists.

Hou Kuimen seemed to say: once I reach the ninth tier, with martial luck at my side, it will be time for me, Hou Kuimen, to be unreasonable. All your elaborate plans—will they still prevail? Will you escape this battlefield alive? If you have the capability, why not break through yourself, Chen Ping'an?!

This exchange, where the higher realm should have had the upper hand, had fallen to an unexpected disadvantage. The crux lay not in Hou Kuimen’s lack of physical prowess or the lightness of his fists; rather, it was that Chen Ping'an seemed to anticipate every move.

At that moment, witnessing Chen Ping'an’s wary demeanor, Hou Kuimen felt a thrill of exhilaration. Throughout his life of training in martial arts, he had never felt such a rush during a breakthrough. Today, Chen Ping'an would help him break through; afterward, he’d leave him whole, provided he could withstand the punches he would deliver once he attained the ninth tier!

The martial luck from the wild world surged forth, descending upon the battlefield and wildly rushing toward Hou Kuimen.

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly; they had finally arrived.

Hou Kuimen's punches were too light, incapable of shattering his bottleneck; at most, they would help him temper some crucial muscles and bones—merely an embellishment. 

Considering the potential impact on future battles, many ninth-tier punches targeted key acupoints. Should they strike him, Chen Ping'an was not afraid of injury, but rather of the martial intent creating chaos within his small world. Thus, he could not afford to endure all of it, needing to offload the majority. While Hou Kuimen may have enjoyed throwing punches, Chen Ping'an felt no satisfaction in countering them.

It was fine; he had experience in fending off martial luck, having done so more than once in the Old Dragon City.

Moreover, Chen Ping'an had endured heavenly tribulations twice in North Ju Lu Prefecture, and had faced off against true opponents at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

With a tip of his toes, Chen Ping'an shot into the sky, ascending straight upward without throwing a punch, merely striving to rise higher, as if he wouldn’t stop until he reached the highest point of the firmament. Even without striking, he met the surging martial luck from the wild world with a punch intent akin to clouds rising over a vast marsh.

The “middle-aged man” paused in his tracks, looking up and muttering to himself, “Can martial luck be snatched? Is business really done this way?”

Because that young Hidden Official had employed some strange method, he seemed to be pulling all the martial luck white rain into the sky, making him appear as if he were ascending with the white rain.

In essence, martial luck in the world was a profoundly ethereal existence; otherwise, even the central Confucian temples of the Great Harmony world would have been unable to intercept it, leading to a situation where they could only let it flow among the talented martial artists across the nine continents.

In the wild world, even the Moon-Touching Mountain could not restrain such matters.

The most awkward position belonged to Hou Kuimen, who could not access the martial luck that had come his way.

With his knees slightly bent, Hou Kuimen also ascended, chasing after the young man whose figure had become as small as a mustard seed, hoping to get closer to the martial luck.

The sword cultivator self-identifying as a "middle-aged man" still refrained from launching a surprise attack on Chen Ping'an. It was not out of respect for rules or righteousness; in the heat of battle, he and Chen Ping'an shared similar styles. Each attack, and indeed each exchange of injuries with opponents, felt like a meticulous transaction.

This young sword cultivator, regarded as superior to Li Zhen and Zhuo Jie in the Sword Immortal rankings, sensed a hint of profound truth from the Dao.

If he struck now, even if successful, it would only bring him losses in his pursuit of the Dao, because in this life and this world, he would only attract the invisible weight of martial luck from heaven and earth.

If he were a pure martial artist, honing his martial path in this way would be beneficial, but alas, he was ultimately a sword cultivator.

No!

That Chen Ping'an's martial intent and motives were all a façade.

Suddenly, he extended his right hand, directly summoning a long sword from a nearby demon sword cultivator. With a gentle shake, he shattered it into dozens of sword fragments. Simultaneously, his left wrist twisted, forcibly shattering several veins with his own sword intent, blood oozing out, which he then smeared across the shards of the sword.

The young sword cultivator, employing one of his many hidden techniques, flicked his sleeve, sending the fragments shooting skyward, aimed straight at Hou Kuimen.

Almost simultaneously, Hou Kuimen's view blurred as the figure a hundred yards away first used a ground-shrinking talisman, then drew two refined flying swords, Song Zhen and Ke Lei, as a guiding force.

Holding his blades in both hands, he struck Hou Kuimen's jaw, piercing through his cheek, and then stabbed into his heart. After landing the hit, he used the ground-shrinking talisman to vanish instantly.

In the next moment, the sword fragments hovered around Hou Kuimen, forming a miniature sword formation, shielding this temporarily ambiguous eighth or ninth-tier martial demon.

Had they not arrived in time, Chen Ping'an would have been able to cleanly sever Hou Kuimen's head.

Gritting his teeth after taking two blows, Hou Kuimen's figure "ascended," momentarily stalling as he continued to soar into the sky, while the martial luck was once again being drawn higher by that young Hidden Official.

Once it was confirmed that Hou Kuimen's life was secure, the sword fragments quickly flickered away, returning to the “middle-aged man.”

The two pure martial artists crashed through two layers of expansive cloud seas.

One layer was just slightly higher than the city walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall, while the higher cloud sea towered far above the city.

Suddenly rising above the cloud sea, Chen Ping'an furrowed his brow again, but this time, it was not about the authenticity or deceit of Hou Kuimen’s actions.

He sensed a genuinely ominous aura of conspiracy.

The martial luck at the higher altitude was undeniably real.

Though Hou Kuimen was unaware of why the young Hidden Official had paused, he still approached the undulating martial luck like a dragon moving through water.

After a moment of contemplation, Chen Ping'an decided to abandon all previous plans and plunged back down into the cloud sea, returning to the ground.

Hou Kuimen would gladly accept the martial luck that was rightfully his. Above the cloud sea, the sun shone brightly, making Hou Kuimen appear like a divine being.

But in an instant, his eyes turned pitch black. After struggling for a moment, he began following Chen Ping'an, dragging the martial luck along with him back toward the ground.

The martial luck surged into Hou Kuimen's body, propelling him toward Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an changed his retreat trajectory three times but still could not evade.

Upon the earth's surface, a massive pit was created, resembling the explosion of a sword immortal's life-sustaining flying sword.

Hou Kuimen, a ninth-tier martial artist, along with all his martial luck, was utterly obliterated.

At the Jia Shen camp, five sword immortal prospects from the wild world no longer concealed their presence, appearing at the edges of the vast pit, each taking their position.

Zhuo Jie, Li Zhen, Yu Si, Liu Bai, and Tan.

The middle-aged man sighed, hiding his figure and departing.

It seemed that a great demon, using its innate divine powers, had possessed the soon-to-breakthrough Hou Kuimen, sacrificing a sure ninth-tier martial artist to heavily injure the young Hidden Official, Chen Ping'an.

Zhuo Jie spoke, “Be cautious; this may be a trap.”

A soft, smiling voice echoed in everyone’s hearts simultaneously, “How could that be possible?”

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 776: Surrounding One and Being Surrounded by One**

Only the sound could be heard, but the person was nowhere to be seen.

Liu Bai had been closely observing the battlefield situation around her. She communicated swiftly through her mind voice, "This situation has arisen suddenly, and there are currently no Sword Immortals to assist us. We must resolve this quickly."

This woman swordsman, who had emerged from the same lineage as the Sword Immortal Shoucheng, had been serving as the vice commander under the main officer in the Jia Shen camp and had yet to draw her sword.

The young swordsman Tan was the first to summon his life-bound flying sword, which flew low and traced a long shimmering sword light around the edge of the pit that remained for a long time.

"We must force the opponent to reveal themselves!" 

With two swords hanging at his waist, Tan pressed his hands on the sword hilts and focused intently on the dusty bottom of the pit. The fine dust could not obscure a swordsman's vision, yet he could not discern what clever tricks the opponent had employed to hide the figure of the young Hidden Official. However, Chen Ping'an had definitely not left this place. Tan communicated with his friends through his mind voice: "It doesn’t matter. Since I can’t see him, I’ll go down to investigate directly. We won’t give him a chance to recuperate. Zhu Ke, pay attention to the movements at the mountain's base beneath the ground. Liu Bai, be on guard for any strikes that might intercept Chen Ping'an."

With that, Tan leaped down, using his life-bound flying sword "Jia Qi" to pave the way. As the sword light dissipated at the edge of the pit, thousands of tiny iron cavalry appeared, densely packed and arrayed. Although each was only the size of a palm, they looked comical; in truth, every single one was like a flying sword. In an instant, countless miniature iron cavalry surged down the slope from the top of the pit, like a tide pouring into a depression.

The flying sword "Jia Qi" took the lead, advancing in a manner most suitable for probing the subtle traps set by the young Hidden Official.

If Tan were a swordsman from the Sword Qi Great Wall, relying solely on this life-bound flying sword, he would at least be rated as a second-tier by the Hidden Official lineage, on par with Yue Qing's hundred-foot spring and Lark in the Sky, as well as Qishou's Jumping Pearl. Should this life-bound flying sword possess more mysteries, it might even be comparable to Wu Chengpei's "Ganlin."

Zhu Ke, as the first disciple of Liu Cha, would have been the only true inheritor if Liu Cha had not taken in a group of named disciples during this battle.

However, since the war began, Zhu Ke had not taken action, remaining more enigmatic than Liu Bai, the female swordsman in the same military tent. Apart from his widely known lineage, the details of his flying swords, life-bound supernatural abilities, and swordsmanship were all unknown. Behind him, a massive sword rack bore six long swords that now detached, encircling the pit. Eventually, the sword tips turned downwards, and each sword plunged into the ground, forming a formation deep underground that would not allow the already injured young Hidden Official any chance to escape. Even if he had the strength to break through the sword formation, he would leave traces behind. At that time, the young Hidden Official would face the interception of fierce flying swords, and there would definitely be more than one.

Yushi wore a black robe, with only a snow-white silk ribbon tying back his hair, looking like a dashing noble.

His thoughts stirred slightly, and several broken weapons on the nearby ground suddenly flew off in different directions before crashing to the ground. Where they passed, there was not a ripple of movement, indicating there were no formations or traps. Logically speaking, from the moment Chen Ping'an clashed with the bait, Hou Kuimen, to the point where Hou Kuimen was possessed by the great demon of the Throne, wielding immense power, even risking mutual destruction with Chen Ping'an, Chen Ping'an had been caught in one unexpected situation after another. Even clad in a magical robe of celestial rank, he should have suffered greatly.

Yet, Yushi still felt something was amiss.

Li Zhen squatted down, pinching a handful of soil and lightly rubbing it. The dust scattered and flew, clinging to a trace of sword intent. Looking around with a smile, Li Zhen said, "Indeed, something is odd. This is a forbidden place similar to a small world. In our last skirmish, he didn’t display this level of skill. Good, very good; now I can accept losing."

As it turned out, the dust that drifted ten zhang away ignited like a wick, instantly turning to ash.

Yushi again manipulated some shattered instruments and the remnants of the demon race, sending them flying into the distance. 

Sure enough, they crashed down like hitting a wall.

The young Hidden Official was both a swordsman and a pure warrior, making him particularly troublesome to kill. Even if he exhausted a breath of pure qi, he could switch to swordsmanship to kill. Once his spiritual energy needed replenishing, he would resort to his martial prowess. The interchange between martial qi and swordsman's spiritual energy was endless. Therefore, in the second skirmish outside the city, when the Jia Shen camp recorded the battle merits of both sides, the young Hidden Official ranked highest among the swordsmen from the Sword Qi Great Wall, having participated throughout the entire battle. This was certainly related to the Sword Immortals needing to guard the Golden River; the Sword Immortals stationed at the city would either defend a given area or shield the younger swordsmen. True opportunities for the Sword Immortals to draw their swords would be limited.

During that battle, the young Hidden Official had constantly concealed his identity and shifted his aura, employing myriad tactics. Unlike the first skirmish outside the city, where Ning Yao protected the formation, allowing him to openly array as a pure warrior, the second time on the battlefield resembled more of a scavenging assassin. Only when absolutely necessary did he resort to using fists and swords for combat. Thus, in the various military camps of the Wildlands, this swordsman from the Sword Qi Great Wall earned a fresh title: Southern Shoucheng, Northern Hidden Official.

Finding Chen Ping'an on the battlefield had become increasingly difficult. Even if they found him, injuring him would be even harder. Even if they were willing to exchange injuries with Chen Ping'an or even risk death for an injury, the other party's retreat was exceptionally decisive. The key was that Chen Ping'an’s combat capabilities were astonishing, making the young Hidden Official, who operated in such a sneaky manner, the most infuriating opponent compared to the more straightforward and powerful Sword Immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

"Goodness, I nearly fell for it. Everyone, I apologize; it was my oversight earlier."

Yushi was inwardly furious as he pressed down on the sword he wore, condensing sword intent into substance. Strands of white sword energy swirled around his arm and sword hilt, creating a chilling aura as a thin layer of frost spread across the entire sword sheath. "But from this, we can see he’s been seriously injured. Otherwise, with Li Zhen's ploy, our Hidden Official would have continued concealing himself and wouldn’t have exposed his flaws this quickly. As an apology, my last strike will be the one!"

Those not in the Jia Shen camp would certainly find Yushi's last remark utterly baffling.

Zhu Ke furrowed his brow and asked, "Li Zhen, how did this small world come to be? Did it borrow from the Saints? Can small worlds even be borrowed?"

Among them, only Li Zhen could claim to be the foremost expert on small worlds.

Li Zhen had already begun strolling about, just as he had during his initial confrontation with Chen Ping'an. Every few steps, he tossed out a treasured item from the mountain. Being the door disciple of the Moonlit Mountain, he lacked for magical treasures.

Moreover, Li Zhen's formation technique was exceptionally profound.

Li Zhen did not trust Zhu Ke's underground sword formation and felt he had to lay down another formation himself to be at ease. This would both prevent Chen Ping'an from breaking out and slightly impede the Sword Immortals' rescue.

Li Zhen smiled, "Heaven knows how it came to be. The urgent matter is to ascertain the mysteries of this small world. Can it assist Chen Ping'an in rising a realm, or is it a place specifically targeting Qi Practitioners that cannot be traversed? Or is it merely a trick to delay the battle, allowing the Sword Immortals to arrive in time to rendezvous with Chen Ping'an?"

Yushi was already inspecting the matter. Around him, the remnants of limbs and broken bodies hovered in the air, bumping into that invisible wall nearby. Yushi glanced into the pit, where the dust had already been dispersed by him; the scene at the bottom remained shrouded in white fog. "Aside from the barrier that severs heaven and earth, the situation at the pit bottom is still uncertain. It seems there’s nothing strange surrounding us. Why don’t we just strike and break this small world?"

Li Zhen shook his head, squatting down to press the final magical treasure deep into the ground while responding with his mind voice, "Not much meaning in that. Chen Ping'an wouldn’t mind if we left now. Don’t forget what our goal is: to surround and kill Chen Ping'an. I’ve already tested him with flying sand and have my answer. Just as you suspected, Chen Ping'an is indeed seriously injured. Through this small world’s tricks, ultimately, he’s still stalling for time. Let’s see what result Tan achieves with his strike."

Yushi felt quite helpless.

With the encirclement in place, they couldn’t find the person, which was quite frustrating.

In the pit, the iron cavalry army had spears attached with colorful banners, vibrant and colorful.

The colorful flags and tassels attached to the spears were the second aspect of Tan's life-bound supernatural ability.

Refining swords required various rare materials, among which the most crucial was soil from the roots of the five great mountains in the Wildlands. It wasn’t merely for show that the "Iron Cavalry Army" had manifested.

Tan, feeling slightly unsettled, focused again and realized he was hovering above a sea of clouds, where several peaks faintly rose above the clouds like islands.

The heavens were vast.

Tan immediately stopped riding the wind and hovered in the air, looking down at the ground, which resembled a battlefield with iron cavalry charging, yet they were all like headless flies, the geographical situation completely illogical. Many iron cavalry that were initially far apart suddenly collided with each other in an instant.

In his line of sight was a troop of verdant iron cavalry, crushing past a crimson army adorned with colorful banners.

Yet Tan did not retrieve his life-bound flying sword "Jia Qi." As long as the iron cavalry trod upon the earth, even in this illusory small world, all the spears attached to banners of the iron cavalry would remain unharmed. In fact, the battlefield was just like this: the iron cavalry continuously shattered and yet continuously regenerated, tirelessly launching one charge after another. Tan quickly discovered the subtlety of this battlefield, as if it were a series of thin chapters of paper, intricately folded by someone behind the scenes, making the marching routes of the iron cavalry entirely within the opponent’s control.

Tan realized that his voice could no longer communicate with Zhu Ke and the others. Trapped in a predicament, the young swordsman still maintained a clear mind, drawing out his twin swords and vanishing in a flash.

After one sword disappeared, a curtain of lightning interwove across the sky, surging wildly, continuously unfolding breathtaking scenes.

One sword transformed into a rainbow, flying urgently toward the farthest point, trying to ascertain the size of this small world.

Tan reached out and grabbed what should have flown thousands of zhang away—a second sword—only for it to stab straight into his back, caught in the young man's hand.

Tan sneered, "Sneaky tricks, relying on some flashy maneuvers to wear me down?"

Atop a peak, a figure as small as a mustard seed suddenly grew as large as a mountain, the towering figure in a blue robe, bearing a sword box.

The law form stood tall on the mountaintop.

It was as if a person stood atop a roadside stone.

Chen Ping'an smiled, looking down at the sword-wielding youth, raising a hand to produce a jade bamboo fan gifted by a student, and swiftly slapped it down. The surrounding sea of clouds was pulled by that overwhelming force, rolling as if boiling, with faint sounds of thunder.

Tan remained utterly still, allowing the great fan to strike down upon him, ultimately passing through.

Tan sneered, "Your true self is indeed heavily injured, relying solely on illusions to delay things."

Chen Ping'an raised a hand again, palm cradling a law seal, flipping it over. The seal appeared like a mountain, once more heading toward Tan.

Tan swung a sword, cleaving the mountain seal in two without a ripple of energy, only the brilliance of the sword.

Once again, it was a false manifestation born from intent.

Tan shook his long sword and beckoned towards the young Hidden Official who was putting on a show.

That "Chen Ping'an" smiled slightly and produced a golden talisman. Due to the immense size of the talisman held by the law form, it appeared overwhelmingly large in Tan's eyes, resembling a golden lightning pool, filled with thunderous energy, drifting toward the young swordsman.

At the same time, Chen Ping'an's law form raised his left hand gently. On the ground, a mountain range was directly uprooted, rising from below, complementing the golden talisman that overshadowed Tan, soaring down toward him.

Tan touched the sword body with his fingertip, pressing the tip of the sword, which burst forth with dazzling brilliance, ultimately creating a large circle of sword light centered around the young swordsman, crashing into the talisman and mountain.

This time, the young Hidden Official's action indeed involved real objects!

Tan’s heart surged with inspiration and he leaned back abruptly, fingers forming a seal. The magical robe on his body radiated a dazzling rainbow of colors, revealing numerous charming celestial musicians, their figures small and adorable, immediately shielding all the vital points of the youth.

Tan directed his sword away from the original spot, and in the next moment, a golden-bodied law form appeared behind him, a stunningly beautiful celestial maiden who slightly bent over, cradling the young man’s figure with her hands.

A long string of blood droplets slowly oozed from Tan's neck.

The long sword beneath the young man's feet trembled slowly, seemingly suppressed by the underlying principles of heaven and earth.

The golden-bodied law form protecting the young man began to show signs of deterioration, the originally flawless dazzling golden form corroding rapidly.

Holding the sword, Tan lightly wiped away the blood from his neck.

It was evidently a place of "impossibility" targeting all Qi Practitioners.

He had nearly lost his head to that fellow's blade.

The youth finally understood the feelings of those who had battled against the young Hidden Official.

Illusions and realities, truth and falsehood, all were matters of the heart and calculations.

On the battlements of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Wei Jin asked the old Sword Immortal, "Do you really not need me to intervene?"

Chen Qingdu smiled, "Intervene? Whose rescue are you talking about, Chen Ping'an or you, Wei Jin? Do you think the other side has no backup plan? Just those five excellent Sword Immortal candidates—who will be responsible for escorting them away? If any of them dies, the Jia Zi camp will suffer."

Wei Jin replied, "With Lu Zhi helping to stabilize the situation, I can give it a try."

Chen Qingdu shook his head, "Just wait and see. Whoever strikes last will gain the upper hand."

Chen Qingdu gazed toward the numerous demon military tents in the south. Even if Zhou Mi were to intervene, it would be manageable. However, Liu Cha, if he found an opportunity to draw his sword, would cause some trouble for the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

For instance, if a disciple he held great hopes for were to die.

At that time, Chen Qingdu would find it inconvenient to draw his sword.

Then who would stop him? Dong San was held back at the Golden River. Lu Zhi? Far from enough. Even with that old deaf jailer who had also found a reason to draw his sword, it still wouldn’t suffice.

At the foot of a mountain far from Tan, Chen Ping'an, who had just returned to his original position, now stood on a relatively slender "mountain range."

Beneath Chen Ping'an was the corpse of Hou Kuimen, who had revealed his true demonic form after death. As for the black armor, purple gold crown, and two feathers, they were damaged but not shattered after the previous collision. According to logic, they should have been picked up as scraps and collected by the Hidden Official, but this time, Chen Ping'an did not collect all of it; he simply took the feathers and the item borrowed from Yan Ming in exchange for one. Moreover, that item’s previous contents had also been cleared out.

As for Hou Kuimen's armor and purple gold crown, Chen Ping'an had used the Mountain Moving technique to place them far from Hou Kuimen's corpse.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an was severely injured, his face pale, to the point that his entire right arm was uncontrollable, trembling slightly—a rare occurrence for him.

Previously, Hou Kuimen's attack had been too vicious; Chen Ping'an had essentially endured a full-force punch from a tenth realm warrior. If he hadn’t evaded slightly, he would have been instantly pierced through the heart by Hou Kuimen's punch.

If it had been on a training ground, taking a peak punch from the tenth realm and surviving would have been an exhilarating experience. 

But now, while it appeared that the young swordsman was toying with the youth, in reality, Chen Ping'an still found it hard to escape the encirclement, which was an extremely unpleasant experience.

The earlier failed strike against that young swordsman left Chen Ping'an feeling extremely helpless. If he had been at the peak of his strength, the head of that genius swordsman should have been placed in a small item by now.

However, the longer this young man remained here, unable to forcibly break out of the small world, the more Chen Ping'an could recover.

Chen Ping'an gazed at the posture of the young man, who was protected by the divine being, without withdrawing his sight for a long time.

Tan did not look at the law form that pretended to be meditating atop the mountain.

The young man stared intently at a lingering breath in the distance. Although he could not clearly see the scene at the foot of the mountain, he was certain that the young Hidden Official was hiding over there.

The majestic law form atop the mountain opened its eyes, fingers forming a sword seal, and from behind the sword box, countless massive flying swords surged forth towards Tan.

The celestial maiden law form that protected the youth turned her body, turning her back to the colossal flying swords resembling celestial ferries.

Tan gritted his teeth and spat blood.

The sword interlaced with lightning suddenly hovered in mid-air, with sword light bursting forth between its tip and hilt, shooting straight toward the sky and the ground.

Chen Ping'an, employing the power to fold heaven and earth, attempted to alter the trajectories of the two beams of sword light. Once he slightly changed the course, the sword light would no longer travel in a straight line, allowing him to prevent the young swordsman from detecting the boundaries of heaven and earth.

Unexpectedly, the young man detonated the flying sword directly, causing the sword light to suddenly expand, filling the heavens as if a beam of support had been raised.

That flying sword was, in fact, Tan's second life-bound flying sword.

Simultaneously, his life-bound flying sword "Jia Qi" transformed from the iron cavalry army back into a sword, returning to Tan's vital point.

The celestial maiden law form clasped her hands together, protecting Tan, even at the cost of destroying a flying sword.

The law form of the celestial musician, unlike an ordinary one, seemed almost alive. Earlier, it had braced itself against the flying sword from the peak's blue-robed figure and now showed a hint of emotional change.

At this moment, she looked down at her master, her expression warm.

That "Yushi," coming and going in haste.

Zhu Ke's long sword, at the previous entrance, flashed with sword light and then vanished.

In the deepest layer of that small world, Chen Ping'an covered the wound on his ribcage caused by the flying sword, smiling ruefully.

What a Liu Bai.

As long as she had shown a slight mercy, even if she were cautious and heartless, according to Chen Ping'an's expectations, lightly injuring "Yushi" to determine the truth, then a distance of over ten zhang would have been enough to allow Chen Ping'an to close in. Once close, whether to kill her or that young man, there would have been ample opportunity.

Unexpectedly, that Liu Bai's life-bound flying sword directly aimed for "Yushi," targeting the core vital points of all swordsmen, forcing Chen Ping'an to slightly shift his body, retreating with a light injury instead.

It was a case of attempting to steal a chicken only to lose the rice.

As for the long sword from Zhu Ke that followed closely, dodging it was not difficult for Chen Ping'an, who quickly "sent it out of the boundary" with ease.

Within the small world where Chen Ping'an resided, Yushi's situation was far more dire than Tan's.

Because Chen Ping'an was gradually recovering from his injuries, he no longer performed any flashy maneuvers. Within the small world, flying swords were everywhere.

In the Jia Shen camp, swordsman Yushi, familiar with the secret archives from the Summer Palace, had more detailed information than Zhu Ke and Liu Bai.

His life-bound flying sword "Waterfall."

After summoning the flying sword, it felt as if the world had turned cold, enveloping him in a swirling cloak.

Thus, even while surrounded by those interweaving and freely flying swords, he was still able to hold on.

If Liu Bai and Yushi had switched places, Liu Bai would likely have already perished.

Chen Ping'an's two life-bound flying swords’ supernatural abilities completely outmatched and countered that strange flying sword of Liu Bai.

It was unfortunate there was no such "good if" circumstance; today's battle had mostly brought about bad accidents and unforeseen events.

The martial artist Hou Kuimen had been similarly tampered with in three crucial treasures. The young swordsman's decisive actions, and Liu Bai’s ruthlessness toward a fellow comrade…

As for within his own small world, folding mountains and rivers like origami was a technique Chen Ping'an had been inspired to develop years earlier when witnessing Mao Fuzi trapped in a law formation in the Great Sui capital city.

It was just that Chen Ping'an had not yet mastered it completely. Otherwise, Li Zhen and Zhu Ke's strong formation breaking wouldn’t have taken merely a single incense stick's time, as the flying sword "Caged Sparrow," unlike the lifeless mountain and water formations, differed from the territories governed by the Saints in academies, temples, or battlefield ruins. The latter's territorial mountains and rivers were nearly fixed, but Chen Ping'an's reliance on "Caged Sparrow" allowed him to manipulate the very essence of heaven and earth. Likewise, as the Hidden Official, Chen Ping'an was unable to truly devote himself to cultivation or sword refinement, otherwise, the levels of this nested world would be even more rounded and seamless.

Such is the nature of the world; benefits are rarely obtained without cost.

If not for becoming the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping'an would have never been able to refine these two life-bound flying swords that resonated with the "Dao of the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Yushi could assure that he would not die temporarily, yet it was still far from comfortable.

The young Hidden Official, aside from using flying swords to kill, would also rely on the "impossibility" that suppressed the opponent's flying swords while allowing his own to flow more smoothly, using pure martial arts to strike with fists, wielding blades that appeared and disappeared.

Yushi's cheek bore a large chunk of flesh that Chen Ping'an had sliced away, his body riddled with injuries.

Fortunately, since it was neither a critical qi point nor a key vital area, Yushi was ultimately still a swordsman, with no fatal injuries.

However, he was a far cry from the elegant figure he had been upon his arrival.

An abrupt sword cleaved through the heavens.

The long sword was sent out of heaven and earth, and Zhu Ke, relying on the remaining strands of sword intent, found the place.

Chen Ping'an's figure vanished, manipulating heaven and earth, having intentionally left that trace of sword intent.

The elusive life-bound flying sword of Liu Bai was hard to trace, but for Chen Ping'an, the sword intent from Zhu Ke’s flying swords was akin to fireflies flickering close by in the dark of night.

Unable to move Yushi, who was protected by the waterfall of sword energy, Chen Ping'an reversed heaven and earth, positioning Yushi—busy resisting over a hundred flying swords from "Moon in the Well"—exactly in the path of that sword light.

Zhu Ke spoke through his mind voice, "Yushi!"

Zhu Ke said no more, as that was not enough to reveal heavenly secrets.

Only a glance of mutual understanding was needed.

Yushi did not disappoint Zhu Ke, reaching out to grasp the sword light.

The sword light bent like a rope, and Zhu Ke, channeling his mind and sword intent, suddenly yanked, attempting to pull Yushi out of the small world that resembled a great prison. 

To prevent Chen Ping'an from taking advantage of the situation and attacking Yushi as he retreated—leaving a trace for him to follow—Liu Bai needed no reminder from Zhu Ke, and summoned her life-bound flying sword that seemed to not exist in this world.

When Zhu Ke struck, he stood atop the celestial maiden's shoulder.

Chen Ping'an sighed slightly, allowing Zhu Ke to rescue Yushi while he aimed to kill the young man, with both sides not impeding one another.

You save your people, I’ll kill your people; it’s a fair trade.

Since Zhu Ke had already anticipated this, they could only settle for second best.

The flying swords that had traversed countless mountains and rivers with Chen Ping'an—initially arriving and departing—finally manifested at the same time.

Then, behind that celestial maiden, a far larger and more imposing blue-robed law form appeared, both hands intertwining into a fist, smashing down towards her head.

Zhu Ke, holding the sword, swept it through the air.

The crescent sword light reappeared, directly slicing through Chen Ping'an's law form that had been holding onto its fist.

Since they could not kill the most vulnerable among the encircled swordsmen, they would return the favor with an unexpected blow, taking down the strongest among them.

Chen Ping'an forcibly changed the thickness of heaven and earth, placing himself within the folded mountains and rivers even more quickly than the pine needle thunder, combined with a shortcut talisman, and instantly arrived behind Zhu Ke.

Zhu Ke was struck hard in the center of his back, falling from the celestial maiden's shoulder and crashing into the distant ground.

Chen Ping'an was then stabbed in the abdomen by Zhu Ke’s retaliatory sword, receiving a solid blow. Zhu Ke had the option to evade but chose not to, clearly intending to exchange injuries with Chen Ping'an.

The two swords, First and Fifteenth, had collided with Liu Bai's life-bound flying sword no less than a hundred times.

The means did not stop there; between heaven and earth, two rivers of talismans emerged, glowing with golden light, surging toward Yushi.

Even after being blasted away by a punch, Zhu Ke still controlled that sword light, drawing an arc in the air, striving to pull Yushi toward himself.

Liu Bai grasped Tan's shoulder, continuing to steer her life-bound flying sword to obstruct First and Fifteenth, while she took Tan to a distance, leaving no chance for Chen Ping'an to engage in close combat.

Indeed, that young Hidden Official closely followed after Yushi.

Yushi, however, roared, "Liu Bai!"

The female swordsman was momentarily blank, instinctively releasing her hold on the young Tan. She was about to self-destruct her golden core and control her life-bound flying sword to pierce her heart, hoping to kill herself before that young Hidden Official.

But the opponent's fingers gripped her neck, yanking her backward, pulling her away from her original position. Then, with a heavy twist, Chen Ping'an directly snapped Liu Bai's entire neck.

Moreover, a punch heavily struck Liu Bai's spine, the force penetrating her body, fracturing her energy channels and even affecting her thoughts, forcing her life-bound flying sword to stutter in its previous trajectory.

Chen Ping'an was about to deliver another punch, trying to shatter Liu Bai's entire back, intending to destroy both her spine and her golden core on the spot, as well as to completely sever her path to immortality.

Unexpectedly, it was as if a heavy hammer struck Chen Ping'an's forehead, forcing his figure to vanish.

Although Liu Bai's physical form was destroyed, she managed to protect half of her Dao foundation. Yet, her chances of ascending to the Fifth Realm—especially the realm of immortals—were now bleak, as difficult as climbing to the heavens.

Chen Ping'an quickly glanced at the area near the young woman’s head.

There was a talisman left behind by that young man, who had quietly inscribed it on her.

To utilize that life-saving talisman, the young man, already wounded more than once, coughed up blood, his face smeared with blood and his vision blurred. He still exerted himself to reach out, wrapping the broken talisman around the golden core and soul of the young woman before pulling it into his sleeve. After completing this, Tan nearly fainted, clinging to the last shred of clarity in his mind, and reached out again, determined to retrieve Liu Bai's skin.

Unexpectedly, beams of light appeared in the sky, whether sword light or star light, enveloping Zhu Ke, Yushi, Tan, and Liu Bai's lifeless body.

Chen Ping'an narrowly avoided Liu Bai's beam but found himself unable to escape within his own small world, unable to evade the second beam that struck him.

As for Liu Bai's physical form, it had already been utterly obliterated by the light beam.

Chen Ping'an was slammed to the ground, staggering in the air and rolling, narrowly dodging a shadow-like beam, and then folding heaven and earth, swiftly retreating hundreds of zhang.

Li Zhen hovered in the sky, resembling an ancient deity traversing through the river of time, raising his hands to what should have been the Northern Dipper hanging in the night sky.

The starry constellation slowly shifted, and within the small world, the four seasons flowed, thunder shook in spring, summer heat blazed, autumn winds howled, and heavy snow fell. The operation of the Dao moved like a grinding mill, grinding all things to dust.

During this period, the countless sword energies previously laid down by Zhu Ke became increasingly fierce. Between heaven and earth, drops of condensed sword essence formed a river of sword energy that continuously expanded, inundating everything.

Chen Ping'an had the option to retract the life-bound supernatural ability of "Caged Sparrow," or he could plunge into a grueling battlefield of pure spiritual energy consumption against Li Zhen.

Chen Ping'an's figure appeared and vanished repeatedly within the small world.

Chen Ping'an slid sideways for over ten zhang and came to a stop.

The manifestation of the "Caged Sparrow" small world condensed into a sword, darting into his vital point.

The small world dissipated.

Chen Ping'an stood on the slope of the pit, while Li Zhen hovered above, only ten zhang away. Zhu Ke, bearing the sword rack, was situated at the very center of the pit, while Yushi supported Tan at the edge of the pit.

The sword formation buried underground by Zhu Ke was about to make a move.

The heavens shifted once more.

This time, the small world was considerably narrower than before, appearing cramped.

Only a few dozen li in diameter.

A landscape filled with strange burial mounds, yet surrounding the mounds were willow trees swaying gently.

Was this truly the young Hidden Official's inner world?

Zhu Ke, who had always been calm, unexpectedly displayed a hint of anger.

Yushi protected himself and Tan with the "Waterfall" flying sword, gritting his teeth with deep resentment.

Why was this Chen Ping'an so hard to kill?!

Li Zhen casually lifted a hand, easily touching the heavens, and chuckled, "The Hidden Official who values his life the most, are you really not planning to flee this time?"

Next, all that Chen Ping'an could kill would simply be Tan's remaining half-life, and possibly Yushi.

As for Li Zhen himself and Zhu Ke, amid this chaotic and smoke-filled attempt to encircle, they possessed plenty of killing flying swords but lacked the ability to unleash them fully.

Chen Ping'an, trapped in the encirclement, swayed his figure. It was evident that having summoned "Caged Sparrow" twice, and facing five opponents alone, his martial body was nearing its limits, and his spiritual energy was nearly depleted.

Li Zhen shook his head, his eyes filled with pity. "Fishing in a dried-up pond, seeking the path to death."

Yet his expression remained relaxed, while his heart was utterly frustrated.

Had he known earlier about the supernatural abilities of Chen Ping'an's two flying swords, their five-person team would never have fallen into such a miserable state. With a little preparedness, not to mention Li Zhen, even the other four Sword Immortal candidates would have had no shortage of magical treasures at their disposal. Many of the offensive treasures and secret methods they had prepared earlier had never had the chance to be employed. As a result, now they were unable to encircle Chen Ping'an, leading to Liu Bai and Tan's paths being obstructed, limiting their future achievements.

But in the path of cultivation, it is often said that knowledge comes at a price.

Chen Ping'an clapped his palms together heavily, smiling, "I’ll send you all on your way; rest in peace."

From all directions of the heavens and earth, from the boundaries of the small world at the round place, innumerable flying swords "Moon in the Well" began to slowly advance toward the four Sword Immortal candidates.

Once again, it was an unreasonable life-bound flying sword!

Li Zhen's heart filled with horror.

This madman really intended to exchange lives?!

Zhu Ke furrowed his brow tightly. Did this young Hidden Official refuse to be killed even in death? Choosing instead to risk his life and Dao, seeking to take one more life?

Moments later.

Chen Ping'an leaned back and fell.

Both "Caged Sparrow" and "Moon in the Well" flew back to their vital points in an instant.

Thus, after discovering the truth, Li Zhen couldn't help but curse.

It turned out that the place where Chen Ping'an leaned back and fell was at the very corner of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

This meant that all of them had been tricked by this damn young Hidden Official.

Using the two life-bound flying swords to gamble with them was a ruse; folding heaven and earth and changing the battlefield was the truth.

However, the subsequent series of events would bring enormous surprises to the Wildlands and the Sword Qi Great Wall.

First, a Hidden Official from the Throne, concealed on the battlefield, revealed himself. With a wave of his large sleeve, he gathered Zhu Ke, who had already drawn his sword, and Li Zhen, who was attempting to retreat, into his cosmic sleeve, simultaneously flicking his fingers.

Sword Immortal Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple cleaved at the great demon aimed at Chen Ping'an with a sword.

Lu Zhi was just about to leave the city walls.

A burly man with a long beard and a sword at his waist directly repelled two Sword Immortals from the Sword Qi River, approaching the battlefield near the Sword Qi Great Wall, pressing down on the sword hilt and looking up at the female Sword Immortal Lu Zhi.

As long as Lu Zhi did not draw her sword, he would not unsheathe his own.

And that was not even the "great" surprise.

Chen Qingdu looked up and smiled.

An elder in gray robes from the Jia Zi camp stepped out from the military tent, seemingly wanting to witness a certain scene in person.

In the shared sky of the Wildlands and the Sword Qi Great Wall.

A beam of light, as large as a mountain, smashed through the grand restrictions of the entire world, striking straight down onto the battlefield, deliberately avoiding the Sword Qi Great Wall and, instead, directly choosing the heart of the demon army south of the Golden River.

On that vast battlefield of hundreds of miles, the earth instantly split apart, sending countless demons flying, resulting in massive casualties.

A man from beyond the heavens, slightly bending his knees, stood on the battlefield, raising both hands to press against his forehead, slowly brushing back his hair.

That man straightened his back, surveying the surroundings filled with demons, and laughed heartily, "You are all surrounded by me." 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 777: Departing and Returning

The man spread his arms wide, palms facing upwards, and gave a gentle shake. After a long separation, he gestured to the members of the Sword Qi Great Wall, especially to the good girls he had been thinking about, hoping for a sign of recognition.

The once-silent Sword Qi Great Wall suddenly erupted with whistles and jeers from atop the city walls.

The female Sword Immortal, Lu Zhi, lowered her gaze, too lazy to look at the man. She truly found it embarrassing.

With his back to the city wall, the man nodded in satisfaction; it felt good to still be this popular. Outside the battlefield, the Sword Qi Great Wall was like a roadside child, and upon encountering a drunken gambler, along with a carefree bachelor, they would shout, "Damn that A-Liang!"

On the battlefield, that man was just A-Liang, nothing more.

A-Liang's gaze wandered, glancing at the scattered military tents, and he called out loudly, "Don’t hesitate! Bring me a few who can fight!"

A burly man with a thick beard turned around, fixed his gaze on A-Liang, and said in a deep voice, "I’ll come."

Without turning his body, A-Liang merely turned his head to look at Liu Cha, who stood alone by the golden river. In the past, they had been quite compatible, being both friends and foes. A-Liang slowly turned around, rubbing his hands together with a smile, "How about we negotiate, good brother? Let’s start with a few who aren’t that strong, just to warm up my hands. With someone like you, I can’t handle too many at once!"

Liu Cha, with his sword and dagger at his side, wore a stoic expression. "I’ve been waiting for you. Why can’t you find a decent sword yet?"

A-Liang pressed his palms together and lightly twisted his wrists. Since the first battle would be tough, he would have to warm up himself.

Liu Cha gently pushed the hilt of his sword with his thumb, and in an instant, he had crossed the golden river, standing before A-Liang with a single downward stroke.

From then on, the two figures disappeared from the battlefield, only to leave behind ripples like a mountain crashing into a great lake, each layer of ripples spreading outward as if a dense array of flying swords had been unleashed, countless in number.

Once A-Liang descended, the remaining demon army within a hundred miles, those who had not perished, were all in a frantic retreat, with the supervising officers of the military tents offering no obstruction whatsoever.

With the sound of thunder cracking, massive pits appeared scattered across the ground.

As all the pits suddenly caved in, life was drained from the surroundings. The bodies and souls of the demon cultivators, upon hitting the ground, were reduced to powder, weapons, and treasures, all enveloped by a condensed sword energy, forming natural sword formations that emerged from thin air, a chilling sword intent slaughtering all.

This was merely the residual sword energy from the clash between the two sword cultivators.

Each standing at the pinnacle of swordsmanship, they forcibly created a phenomenon in the world.

A certain military tent, relatively close to their battlefield, was instantly split in half, leaving several cultivators caught completely off guard, not knowing how they had met their demise.

Liu Cha stood atop the divided tent; the tent beneath him remained intact, while the cultivators inside had already scattered like birds and beasts.

Several miles away, A-Liang halted, reaching out to grab a flying sword wielded by a fifth-tier sword cultivator. He first tightened his grip, then positioned his fingers against the sword’s tip and hilt, applying pressure to bend it into an exaggerated arc.

This flying sword was as thin as a hair, extremely delicate, and crucially, it could conceal its movements through the currents of time, indicating it belonged to a sword immortal highly skilled in assassination.

In the blink of an eye, the flying sword was nearly bent into a crescent moon by A-Liang's fingers. Just as it was about to snap, a barely perceptible grunt echoed from afar. At a huge cost, the wielder forcibly retrieved the sword that A-Liang had restrained, then swiftly retreated, intent on escaping the battlefield. However, to his surprise, a man appeared behind him, pressing down on his head. Sword intent poured forth like water, and A-Liang yanked back, forcing the man to lean back. A-Liang looked down at the face of the slain sword immortal, "I told you, it wouldn’t be that little bastard Shoucheng. As long as I’m on the battlefield, he’ll never have the guts to draw his sword."

Gently pushing the body aside, it fell a dozen yards away, hitting the ground heavily.

In another direction, a brilliant white beam of light shot up from the earth, the soul of a demon sword immortal abandoning its corporeal form. Along with the tightly wrapped golden core and nascent soul, it was swept away by the beam infused with boundless sword intent, leaving no trace behind.

During this brief pause, A-Liang glanced around. The white mist enveloped him, indicating he had fallen into a small world created by some great demon.

"A little trick, trying to scare me? How did you know I’m easily frightened? Well, it’s true; I do turn red whenever I see a girl." A-Liang seemed to warm his hands, and the white mist gradually dispersed around him.

In the battlefield of black and white, a colossal demon in its true form loomed over, dominating the space, looking down at the sword cultivator as small as a black dot.

A-Liang looked up, momentarily taken aback. "What a big one!"

He asked a very sincere question, "I don’t even know you. How dare you come?"

The reasoning was simple: aside from those with ancient thrones in the Hall of Heroic Spirits, other demons who had never crossed paths with A-Liang in battle did not qualify to be called great demons. Since they weren’t great demons in A-Liang's eyes, were they even worth his attention?

The massive demon, deemed "unknown" by A-Liang, was just about to unleash its divine powers and attempt to crush the renowned A-Liang in the wild world.

Unexpectedly, a straight white line appeared from above, as if cleaved in half by a long sword.

In this small world of a celestial demon cultivator, although it was instantly injured to its core and could easily shift the battlefield, it had just managed to stabilize its momentum and barely fend off the overwhelming sword intent brought by that bright line. It ended up on the edge of its small world, trying to increase the distance from A-Liang. Yet, it had no idea that within the entire realm, not only along the boundary of its small world but even outside it, countless rays of light pierced through the heavens and earth, making it seem as though the entire small world had turned into A-Liang’s domain.

A forest of swords, with thousands of swords embedded into the ground.

Ultimately, the great demon, pinned down by dozens of sword lights, could barely move its body. Even the slightest thought would inflict excruciating pain. It was horrified to find itself trapped in a tragic situation, where escape was impossible even within its own small world.

A-Liang paid no heed to this celestial demon.

The small world was as fragile as porcelain, as if a sword immortal could shatter it with just a light tap of their sword tip.

Once the world regained clarity, starting from A-Liang’s position, countless beams of sword light surged forth, expanding like a gigantic circle, sweeping away everything within several dozen miles.

Liu Cha, who had previously been atop the military tent, found it no difficulty to withstand the sword lights. Now suspended in mid-air, he became the only one confronting A-Liang on the battlefield once more.

He said calmly, "A word of advice: don’t get involved."

Even if one was willing to die, at the very least, they should inflict a bit of injury on A-Liang.

Liu Cha sheathed his sword, reached behind him, and drew it again, gripping the sword firmly.

In the wild world, opportunities for swordplay were almost nonexistent, which is why Liu Cha had looked forward to reuniting with A-Liang. He had thought it would happen in the majestic world, never expecting this man to break through two major realms and return directly to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

A-Liang reached out, retrieving a standard long sword from the battlefield north of the golden river. After weighing it in his hand, he sighed; it felt slightly too light, indicating even the sword makers were forced to cut corners. This battle was indeed quite brutal.

When Liu Cha had first met him, he had slashed at A-Liang’s face. That was hardly the way of the martial world.

A-Liang retaliated with a strike against the burly man.

After their respective blows were exchanged, A-Liang was sent crashing into the sky. The entire sea of clouds above the Sword Qi Great Wall was torn apart, scattering like tattered threads.

With a heavy step back, A-Liang stomped down hard in mid-air, halting himself.

Liu Cha crashed into the ground, his body sinking deep into the earth, disappearing from sight as a series of muffled thunderclaps sounded from below.

The two men each rapidly prepared for a second strike, A-Liang descending from the sea of clouds, while Liu Cha reappeared on the ground.

Both attacks were straight and direct.

This time, they retreated even further apart.

A-Liang was directly pushed back into the highest part of the Sword Qi Great Wall's sea of clouds, dispersing a flurry of sword flowers, casually shaking off the residual sword intent lingering on Liu Cha’s blade. He smiled at an old Daoist man who had settled in the heavens, "Old buddy, it’s been twenty years! Those girls from the Sword Qi Great Wall who used to have runny noses have all grown into stunning young ladies, right? Do they know they have an uncle A-Liang who travels far and wide?"

The old Daoist, holding a whisk in one hand, switched it to the other, resting it against his severely damaged staff with a smile. He cursed lightly in the dialect of the Qingming world.

After a round of "polite" pleasantries, A-Liang vanished in a flash.

The whole sea of clouds trembled as sword intent was drawn forth, and the seated sage of the Daoist sect, somewhat helpless, extended a hand, gently pressing down on the sea of clouds, halting its tumultuous motion.

A-Liang raised his arm high, resembling an untrained child with a sword, merely swinging it down.

He struck Liu Cha once more, causing both the man and his sword to vanish into thin air, retreating deep into the ground.

This time, however, A-Liang didn’t take a single step back, though the long sword in his hand shattered into nothingness.

In this battlefield, even with just two opposing figures, neither was willing to close the distance.

Unless the old man in gray standing outside the tent commanded the several demon kings to launch a siege against the man.

Yet the old man merely watched coldly from the sidelines.

Some demon kings, who had initially been eager to act, immediately dismissed their intentions to strike first.

After all, Liu Cha had yet to unleash his full strength.

With no sword in hand, A-Liang formed hand seals. Two torrents of sword energy surged crazily toward the retreating Liu Cha, each carrying the true essence of the sword paths from the Sword Qi Great Wall and the wild world, thick and unmatched. The two sword energies rushed forth like two flooding dragons, crashing into the earth below.

The ground within a hundred miles rumbled and collapsed.

A-Liang, who had only been a few yards above the ground, now found himself suspended in mid-air.

The fifth-tier demon cultivators looked down from above.

Liu Cha stood atop the "earth," which was a hundred yards below the battlefield, one hand behind his back, his other hand forming seals with two fingers. Although the burly man did not hold a sword in his hand, a snow-white jade plate appeared before him, thin and translucent, emanating brilliant light like a moon rising in the human realm, blocking the two torrents of sword energy descending from the heavens.

The two cascading waterfalls of sword energy smashed against the shining white plate.

Behind Liu Cha, the soil of the mountain roots continued to crack and splinter.

The sword energy scattered, and many low-tier demon cultivators watching the mountains and rivers from afar felt their eyes burn as if they were commoners staring directly at the sun. They had to retract their divine senses, no longer daring to continue gazing at the "small world" that had been forcibly created by both sides.

Liu Cha, dressed in coarse hemp garments, his sleeves fluttering in the wind, looked up and said, "After going to the outer sky and killing some otherworldly demons, is this all it amounts to? Or is it that the second Daoist is not as capable as he claims?"

A-Liang laughed, "I’m only saying this as a friend. If you truly think so, then you’re going to die."

Liu Cha shook his head and surprisingly sheathed his sword, allowing the two torrents of sword energy to crash into him.

The burly man gathered no strength, intentionally restraining the sword energy.

Steady as a mountain, he stood firm, allowing the sword energies to collide against him. Liu Cha’s own sword path was like towering mountains, and after the two sword energy torrents collided with his form, they wound around him, creating waves of sword energy that soared dozens of yards high.

While having heard of many sword energies or witnessing them firsthand, Liu Cha had certainly traveled across several realms. After honing his skills at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had even been able to condense his pure sword intent into a tangible form.

However, at this moment, Liu Cha was solidifying his sword path into his very essence.

A-Liang chuckled.

Then, between him and the burly man, an ethereal river of time appeared, shimmering with a beautiful, glass-like color.

This entire river twisted like a colossal flying sword, wrapping Liu Cha within it, as if he were placed inside someone else's sword sheath, and that person was now returning the long sword to its sheath.

Originally the river of time was most harmonious with the principles of the world. Yet, after being pulled by A-Liang, it began to face rejection by the laws of the wild world, causing countless divine truths to clash with it. At the junction of the two, colorful shards of the river of time shattered like broken ice. But even though the river of time was being compressed, it grew tighter and stronger, as if a long sword forged from the glass-like golden body of ascendance had appeared between heaven and earth.

The old man in gray exclaimed, "Good technique."

In a certain military tent, a scholar who had devoted himself solely to teaching his disciples, oblivious to the outside world, lifted his head to carefully observe the distant battlefield.

A-Liang looked up.

Liu Cha, whose true form was temporarily restrained and whose sword path was gradually being worn down, certainly would not simply resign to fate.

A figure, standing tall within the heavens, revealed only half of its body above the earth. With both hands gripping a sword, it fell toward A-Liang, the sword tip aimed directly at him.

At the ruins of the previous military tent, another Liu Cha appeared, his fingers pressed together, forming a long sword with sword intent.

Earlier, A-Liang had jokingly said he couldn’t handle many opponents like Liu Cha.

However, Liu Cha—now divided into three forms, with his sword path embodied, his yang spirit manifesting, and his yin spirit wandering—was not equivalent to three peak Liu Chas.

A-Liang never fought battles where he could only be hit.

Even with opponents like Dong Sangeng from the Sword Qi Great Wall, this current Liu Cha from the wild world, and that shameless true invincible from the Qingming world.

In the next instant, an exaggerated and towering manifestation emerged behind Liu Cha’s form, pressing down on his head and forcing it into the ground.

Before leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, A-Liang had always wanted to tell Liu Cha that whether or not he possessed a suitable sword mattered little, as long as his opponent also lacked a celestial sword, it didn’t matter much.

In the past, A-Liang hadn’t mentioned it during their encounters on the battlefield, as they were friends, making it awkward to say.

Being too direct with words could easily lead to losing friends.

At the same time, the "A-Liang" pressing down on Liu Cha’s head wielded a sword in his other hand, striking down decisively. In a single line, eight military tents were located.

Three demon kings—Bai Ying, the old man with a long staff, and the golden-armored deity—each took action to block that strike.

A-Liang cheekily remarked, "Gotta run!"

The river of time that A-Liang had condensed into a long sword shattered.

A streak of sword light inexplicably collided with the wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Even the golden river was pierced by a sword.

Once the sword light dissipated, a man was seen lying atop the city wall, slowly sliding down.

The old man in gray arrived at Liu Cha’s true form, glancing at the burly man with blood seeping from his mouth, and said with a smile, "So, the next time you strike, don’t be so timid."

Liu Cha nodded.

The yin spirit manifestation that had traveled far and the yang spirit that had just returned A-Liang a sword both returned to one.

The man who had been "sent" onto the city wall initially found himself at the top of the word "fierce," sliding all the way down to the ground. During this time, he didn’t forget to secretly spit into his palm, his head turning left and right, carefully smoothing his hair and sideburns. When fighting, one must have aspirations. What aspirations? Naturally, it was about style.

He remembered a little girl selling wine in the Huángliáng Fudi, who had once said that upon seeing his face, it was as if a little deer had suddenly jumped out of her heart, running wildly on her path.

Such heartfelt words could be accepted, but as for the admiration of the girls? That could be passed.

The man halted mid-slide, suddenly stepping forward. He greeted an old sword cultivator with a strange expression, "Isn’t this our Brother Yin? What are you staring at? The more you look, the more you can improve your realm!"

He slapped the shoulder of the old sword cultivator, Yin Chen, and complained, "Brother Yin, I’m not saying this to you, but during the years I’ve been away, have you only been watching pretty girls? Otherwise, how come you haven’t reached the fifth tier yet?"

With a slight tilt of his shoulder, Yin Chen felt a twinge of pain. The other party’s hands were unceremonious, and despite being known for his standoffish nature at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Yin Chen remained tight-lipped.

A-Liang clapped both hands hard against the old sword cultivator's cheeks, eyes wide open, shaking him vigorously, "Brother Yin, Brother Yin! Can’t you even recognize me? Are you stupid…?"

Yin Chen helplessly replied, "I do recognize you. I’m just a bit too excited to speak right now."

A-Liang released him, restraining his laughter. "At least a few familiar faces remain. It’s my fault for arriving late. It’s always like this, passing by and missing out."

Yin Chen sensed something was wrong and, as expected, the next moment, A-Liang had him in a headlock, trapping him under his arm. He struggled to break free while enduring A-Liang's spittle. "Brother Yin, seeing you still a bachelor pains my heart."

Suddenly, A-Liang let go of the old sword cultivator and stepped off the wall, floating toward the city wall, finally arriving beside the Grand Sword Immortal.

On the city wall, Wei Jin clasped his fists and smiled, "Senior A-Liang."

A-Liang patted Wei Jin on the shoulder, lamenting, "What’s there to see? I’m still a bachelor."

A-Liang sat cross-legged, facing south, his expression turning solemn for once. Even with his disruption, it was but a momentary peace; the battle would continue, and people would continue to die.

On the battlefield, the slaughter persisted.

Chen Qingdu stood beside A-Liang, smiling as he asked, "Is there really no beautiful yellow-crowned Daoist in the White Jade Capital of the Qingming world to keep people from leaving?"

A-Liang pointed at the clouds above, then rested his chin on one hand, gazing at the battlefield. He pressed a hand against his chest, silently nourishing his energy, though his words were not entirely sincere, “Oh, of course there are! But only a glimpse beneath the White Jade Capital; just that old buddy’s two junior sisters looked at me like they wanted to eat me. And don’t get me started on the other celestial maidens. Traveling the world, that’s the most frustrating thing.”

Chen Qingdu chuckled.

A-Liang then asked, "How's that kid's injury? I only caught a glimpse from afar; it looked rather strange, so I couldn’t see it clearly."

Chen Qingdu casually replied, "Well, as long as Ning girl carries him back, he won’t die. Half-dead situations are something one gets used to."

A-Liang said, "After all, he’s just a young man, still an outsider. Grand Sword Immortal, as an elder, should protect him a little. This kid, aside from liking Ning girl, really doesn’t owe the Sword Qi Great Wall anything. Relying on age to bully the young isn’t a good habit."

Chen Qingdu laughed, "Are you teaching me how to live or how to wield a sword?"

A-Liang stood up, whispering, "I’m not one to teach others, but if the Grand Sword Immortal insists on learning, I suppose I could reluctantly impart a lesson."

Wei Jin was greatly impressed.

Whether it was during the previous sword strike or in their current conversation, A-Liang was indeed the senior he admired.

The old man cast a sidelong glance at A-Liang.

With a tremor of the city wall, A-Liang was already gone, slipping away quickly.

But was the direction in which Senior A-Liang fled the wrong one?

Even Wei Jin was left dumbfounded and couldn’t help but ask, "Grand Sword Immortal, what’s going on?"

Chen Qingdu glanced at Wei Jin, "Can’t you tell? They’re fighting."

Wei Jin had no words to retort.

Chen Qingdu took another look at the suspended rainbow starting from the city wall. A-Liang’s retreat was far too rapid, and he smiled, asking, "When he traveled to the Baoping Continent, didn’t he mention how much he loved being surrounded and beaten by a group of ascended beings?"

Wei Jin paused for a moment, looking strange. "Back then, A-Liang told me he was among the strongest in the Sword Qi Great Wall, certainly ranking in the top fifty. He even urged me not to think he was bragging—he was very… emphatic about it."

That’s why Wei Jin initially thought he had met a fraud, but thankfully A-Liang’s insights and understandings of swordsmanship, while seemingly nonsensical, genuinely benefited Wei Jin. He held back from testing his skills at that time, and after that, he participated in A-Liang’s so-called little betting game, losing the sword-nourishing gourd, and then entered seclusion. Indeed, he successfully ascended to the fifth tier. After emerging from seclusion, Wei Jin naturally became enamored with the Sword Qi Great Wall, wanting to see for himself what a place with fifty A-Liang’s truly looked like.

Chen Qingdu suddenly remarked, "Besides always presenting himself as a swordsman, A-Liang is also a scholar."

As the man’s figure receded, he crossed over the golden river, and after heavily landing, the surrounding demon army, after a moment of shock, immediately retreated like a tide, frantically fleeing, some using wind to ride their swords, others merely running.

"Damn it, he’s back again!"

The man raised his head high, running his hands through his hair, and mused aloud, "Can I be any more handsome? Honestly, I can’t help but brag!"

As he spoke, a land-based whirlwind began to form around him, growing larger and larger until it blotted out the sun, a formation of flying swords coalescing.

The sword formation was entirely unaffected by the dominating laws of the wild world.

After distancing himself from the Sword Qi Great Wall, A-Liang ascended to the outer sky, killing countless otherworldly demons, and even engaging in a life-and-death struggle with the second Daoist. He had already reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship and was now on another level, able to touch the heavens.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 778: Drunkenness

The great demon, Huang Luan, who had just employed a technique to manipulate the world within his sleeves and forcibly whisked away the Bamboo Baskets and their entourage from the base of the Sword Qi Great Wall, was known for refining countless immortal ruins into his own courtyard.

Lu Zhi left the city wall with sword in hand, determined to kill this peak demon reputed to possess the most ethereal aura in the wild lands. Despite the efforts of the sword immortal Mi Hu from the Golden River, who intervened with a strike, Huang Luan managed to escape with the cost of losing half of his right sleeve and a portion of his sleeve-world, thanks to the timely assistance from his ally, Yang Zhi, who helped him return to the Jia Shen camp.

Standing on the increasingly sparse Golden River, where sword immortals were becoming few and far between, Lu Zhi chose not to return to the Sword Qi Great Wall but to remain and guard her territory.

Previously, her sword strikes had been rather restrained, constrained by the battlefield's location between the river and the city wall, where their side had too many sword cultivators.

The old sword cultivator Yin Chen sat cross-legged within the strokes of a large character, shaking his head with an expression of disdain. He scoffed, muttering, “If I had such cultivation, Huang Luan wouldn’t have escaped. This battle has reached such a stage, yet you still don’t know how to account for it. How can you, Lu Zhi, call yourself a great sword immortal? Women are just women, sentimental at heart.”

It was perhaps this very attitude that earned Yin Chen his esteemed reputation at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Outside the Jia Shen camp, Huang Luan shook his right sleeve, and like beans scattering on the ground, several young sword cultivators, no bigger than mustard seeds, appeared one after another.

The Bamboo Basket thanked him for taking back his sword, while Li Zhen’s expression was grim, and Yu Si looked utterly disheveled, supporting the unconscious youth, Tan.

As for Liu Bai, who had suffered the most, thankfully her soul had been gathered back by Tan.

Not a sword cultivator, but the young leader of the Jia Shen camp, Mu Ji, upon realizing Liu Bai’s predicament, though anxious, still bent deeply to express gratitude to the senior.

Huang Luan smiled, “Mu Ji, you all are the fortune of our world. The Dao is long; there will always be a chance to repay this life-saving grace.”

Mu Ji's expression was resolute as he replied, “I will never forget this great kindness.”

Once a sword immortal progeny died in the Jia Shen camp, Mu Ji, as its leader, would not only face consequences on the ledger but also on his conscience. Thus, Huang Luan's actions were tantamount to saving his life.

Yang Zhi waved her hand, directly apprehending Yu Si and forcing him back, then stood in the place Yu Si had occupied, gently cradling the young boy in her arms. She extended a finger to press against Tan’s forehead, and a stream of the purest water energy flowed from her fingertip, nourishing the boy’s vital points. Simultaneously, she rubbed her fingers together to condense a gleaming white short sword, an ancient relic she had treasured for years. Pressing it to his forehead, she thought that if Tan had lost his life-bound flying sword, she would give him another.

Moments later, Tan slowly regained consciousness and, upon seeing the familiar face of the woman in the imperial crown and black dragon robe, his eyes suddenly turned red as he trembled, “Master.”

Yang Zhi spoke softly, “A little setback; don’t let it weigh on your heart.”

After all, Tan was still young at heart. This calamity had severely injured him; although his Dao heart remained intact, it was truly a challenge. Yet heartbreak was genuine, and he choked out, “That guy was too treacherous. The five of us seemed to always be fighting against him. What will happen to Sister Liu Bai?”

In the end, the boy’s concern was still for Sister Liu Bai.

Yang Zhi laughed, “As for Liu Bai, Master originally thought her appearance was not handsome enough to match you. Now, it’s good; let Mr. Zhou simply replace her with a better appearance, and you two can become Dao partners.”

Tan quickly shook his head, for that was not his intention.

Yang Zhi affectionately ruffled the boy’s hair, “It’s all up to you.”

Huang Luan was greatly surprised; when did Yang Zhi take in a direct disciple?

The sword immortal Shou Chen hurriedly arrived at the Jia Shen camp, taking away his junior sister’s soul. After confirming that Liu Bai’s Golden Core and Nascent Soul were not severely harmed, Shou Chen let out a sigh of relief, still thanking everyone before carefully using his technique to gather Liu Bai’s soul and promptly took a detour to find his master.

As for the reason for taking the detour, it was naturally because of that Ah Liang.

Huang Luan departed on the wind, returning to the palace of jade towers, choosing a secluded spot to begin her breathing exercises, swallowing a copious amount of spiritual energy.

In this battle, she had suffered the greatest losses; her carefully nurtured disciple, Hou Kui, had been used as a puppet on the battlefield to target the young hidden officials. Not only had she lost an important piece, but she also received a sword strike each from Lu Zhi and Mi Hu, shattering half of her robe’s sleeve and a portion of her small world, leading to a needless loss of three hundred years of her cultivation.

Huang Luan’s heart stirred, and she saw a building appear before her, made from the carcasses of numerous serpentine dragons, serving as beams and corridors. She immediately removed the restrictions and absorbed it into her own realm.

Huang Luan smiled, “Thank you, Ancestor, for the gift.”

Mu Ji had already returned to the military tent.

The Bamboo Basket and Li Zhen stood side by side, observing the battle from a distance.

In the earlier encirclement against the hidden official, the two of them had not had the chance to unleash their full power, and neither had sustained injuries. However, compared to Liu Bai, Tan, and Yu Si, they were likely the most frustrated.

Li Zhen voiced his thoughts to the Bamboo Basket, “I didn’t expect to lose due to a life-bound flying sword’s abilities. If it hadn’t been for that, even if Chen Ping An had two more life-bound flying swords, he would still have died!”

The Bamboo Basket replied, “Complaining is fine, but I hope you don’t vent your anger on Tan and Yu Si.”

Li Zhen scoffed, “If you hadn’t reminded me, I would’ve forgotten they were part of the fight. Three useless people; what have they done besides dragging us down?”

The Bamboo Basket frowned, “Li Zhen, I dare say that in a hundred years, even the most severely injured Liu Bai will achieve a higher level of sword Dao than you.”

Li Zhen fell silent for a moment, then mocked himself, “Are you sure I can live for a hundred years?”

The Bamboo Basket countered, “Does it really matter? Are you sure you’re a sword cultivator? Can you even draw a sword for yourself?”

The Bamboo Basket was greatly puzzled; the previous Li Zhen from Tuo Yue Mountain, though unruly and arrogant, had shown a kind of sharp spirit. Yet now, ever since Li Zhen had 'died' once, his temperament seemed to have become increasingly extreme, even disheartened.

Li Zhen rubbed his cheeks, muttering to himself, “Have you personally walked through the River of Time? Perhaps you haven’t, or maybe you have, but you surely haven’t seen the riverbed. I have walked through it; that is fate.”

The Bamboo Basket listened to Li Zhen’s murmurs, frowning deeply.

Yu Si stood alone, even more dejected than the morose Li Zhen. 

Solitude often breeds a sense of loneliness, while loneliness can often arise in the midst of bustling crowds.

A figure suddenly appeared beside him, a young woman with crimson eyes. Her robe was woven with fine, dark green threads, rivers and streams she had refined over the long years.

She softly comforted, “Young Master, it’s alright; I’m here.”

Then she fixed her gaze on the elegant Yang Zhi, confronting her; they were the new and old River Lords.

Yu Si brushed away the young woman’s hand and stepped forward, saying indifferently, “Let’s go.”

The woman followed behind him.

Tan was taken aback by this scene.

Mu Ji, sitting inside the military tent, raised his head and then lowered it again.

Mu Ji had always known the sects of Li Zhen, the Bamboo Basket, and Liu Bai, but today he learned the true backing of Tan and Yu Si.

The youth scratched his head, unsure when he would be able to take in disciples and become their support.

Chen Ping An suddenly awoke, sitting up in bed. Fortunately, it was the small residence in Ningfu he hadn’t returned to for a long time, not the corner of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping An pressed his hand to his forehead, feeling a splitting headache as he exhaled a heavy breath. Such a small action caused the small world within him to tremble violently; it should not be a dream, given the multitude of divine techniques on the mountain and the countless strange occurrences in the world that required caution.

Chen Ping An stared blankly toward the door.

Sitting on the threshold was a man, lifting a wine jug to his lips.

The strong scent of herbs in the room couldn’t mask the fragrant aroma of the wine.

The man stood up, leaning against the door, and smiled, “Don’t worry; a person like me should only appear in the dreams of young ladies.”

At this, the man wiped his mouth and began to chuckle to himself.

Life is as fleeting as a spring dream, leaving no trace; like a spring dream, unripe millet, the deer runs away…

The scholar recalled some beautiful verses from his readings, sounding quite serious indeed.

Chen Ping An felt a weight lift from his shoulders; he was definitely dealing with a real person.

Chen Ping An and Ah Liang locked eyes for a long moment, and the first words out of his mouth were an utterly unromantic question: “Ah Liang, when are you leaving?”

He hoped Ah Liang would return to the Sword Qi Great Wall, but he didn’t want him to stay there; it would be fatal.

In this war, the only one who could confidently say he would definitely not die was the old man in gray from the Jia Zi camp in the wild lands. Even the great demons like Yang Zhi and Huang Luan, lords of the wild lands, did not dare to assert such certainty.

On the side of the Sword Qi Great Wall, no one was exempt.

“I want to leave. A whole group of ascendants won’t stay; if I don’t want to leave, the old sword immortal can’t chase me away. You think you can persuade me?” 

Ah Liang sighed, swaying his wine jug. “As expected, it’s the same old story. Why think so much when you can’t manage it all? The boy back then was unlike any boy; today’s youth is still unlike young people. Do you think that once you pass this threshold, you’ll be able to live a comfortable life? Dream on.”

The outcome of today’s events may seem to stem from yesterday’s causes, but they often turn out to be the causes of tomorrow’s events.

Why do people cultivate on the mountain? It’s not just about taking up a good feng shui spot.

Ah Liang pointed the wine jug at the young man. “You shouldn’t have started practicing martial arts and cultivation so early. This senior brother of yours is unfit for the role, and I’ll talk to him next time we meet.”

Cultivators labor with their minds, not their bodies, while pure martial artists labor with their bodies, not their minds. This kid, however, managed to do both, which is just asking for trouble.

But Ah Liang didn’t say anything too harsh; his own words were a bit insensitive, but at least it was better than standing around complaining all day, or else a man’s life would be without hope.

Ah Liang gestured for Chen Ping An to rest and cultivate, while he sat back on the threshold to continue drinking. This jug of immortal wine was borrowed from the sword immortal Sun Juyuan on his way here; he didn’t have anyone at home, so don’t blame him for not inviting.

Chen Ping An curiously asked, “Did you get into a fight?”

Ah Liang faced the courtyard, looking lazy, his back to Chen Ping An, “Not much, just two times. If it went on longer, I reckon the Jia Zi camp would be in total chaos. I’ve been afraid of hornets since I was a child, so I hurried here to drink a few sips to calm my nerves.”

He wasn’t the one getting beaten, so Ah Liang couldn’t muster any enthusiasm.

Yet, after a long-awaited return to familiar ground, the taste of the wine remained the same, but many friends had turned into old acquaintances, and the sadness lingered more.

It seemed that his life had always been this way; no matter how much he drank, it was hard to find joy.

Ah Liang casually asked, “Did you promise the old sword immortal something?”

Chen Ping An replied, “The Sword Qi Great Wall can hold for an additional three years.”

Unknowingly, he had already spent a few years at the Sword Qi Great Wall. If he were in the Hao Ran world, it would have been enough time for Chen Ping An to finish another tour of Shujian Lake. If he traveled alone, he could have traversed either North Ju Lu Prefecture or Tongye Prefecture.

Since taking on the role of hidden official, every day in the summer retreat palace felt like a year, and the only act of leisure was to escape to the cold retreat palace to teach those children martial arts.

“You’re really foolish.”

Ah Liang shook his head, saying, “Have you considered that if Qiu Miao were to be the hidden official, taking on a deputy would be much easier for you? The outcome for the Sword Qi Great Wall wouldn’t differ much. Now that the fifth world has been opened, have you discussed the details of the mirage city to the north with the old sword immortal?”

Chen Ping An intentionally overlooked the first question and softly said, “He mentioned it. The entire mirage city is a replica ascending platform that has been constructed over several millennia, combined with the summer retreat palace and cold retreat palace of the hidden official lineage, forming an ancient Three Mountains formation. At that time, it will carry a batch of sword seeds from the Sword Qi Great Wall to break the sky and head to the newest world. However, there is a major issue; the mirage city is like a small temple and cannot accommodate the higher-level sword immortals, so those leaving must be sword cultivators beneath the middle fifth realm. Moreover, the old sword immortal doesn’t trust certain sword immortals to guard it.”

Ah Liang clicked his tongue in amazement, “The old sword immortal is truly deep; I didn’t even know about this. In the past, while roaming around, I only guessed the general idea. The old sword immortal doesn’t mind pushing all local sword immortals to their demise, but one thing he does well is that he is always lenient with the young, ensuring they have a way out. Now that you mention it, it makes sense; in the newest world, for five hundred years, no upper fifth realm cultivator will be allowed in, lest they be reduced to ruins.”

It was indeed the case that in the courtyard of any great family, one could find a jar or two of silver.

For such an extraordinary plan to ascend, who would protect the formation? Naturally, it would be the old sword immortal himself taking action.

Ah Liang couldn’t help but take a hearty swig from his wine jug, sighing, “Our old sword immortal is the most unsatisfied sword cultivator, half-dead, languishing for ten thousand years, just to give out two sword strikes. So, in some matters, the old sword immortal may act unscrupulously; you can scold him, but don’t harbor any hatred.”

Chen Ping An shook his head, “I won’t hate; I wouldn’t dare to scold.”

Ah Liang laughed, “Every now and then, a few curses won’t hurt.”

Chen Ping An sighed, “The old sword immortal holds grudges; if I curse him, I can’t escape.”

Ah Liang nodded gravely, “When drinking and chatting, buttering him up, rubbing his shoulders and back, regardless of the situation, you should say thank you to the old sword immortal for his hard work. You’ve suffered such serious injuries; just limping over to the thatched cottage on the city wall to enjoy the view, that’s enough silence to speak volumes. Do you need to feign pity? You’re already pitiful enough. If it were me, I’d borrow a straw mat from a friend and sleep outside the old sword immortal's cottage!”

Chen Ping An laughed and then, feeling drowsy, peacefully drifted back to sleep.

Ah Liang remained sitting on the threshold, showing no intention of leaving, slowly drinking his wine while muttering to himself, “In the end, there is only one truth: the child who cries gets the candy. Chen Ping An, you’ve never understood this since you were little; you’ve been at a disadvantage.”

Those who are capable take on more work, and over time, it inevitably leads others to take it for granted.

The lineage of the Literary Sage.

The old scholar has a share of merit in the fifth world.

The first disciple, Cui Zhan, stationed at the Treasure Bottle Prefecture.

With sword in hand, he stands at the Tongye Prefecture.

The closed-door disciple, Chen Ping An, has been at the Sword Qi Great Wall for two and a half years as the hidden official.

And all the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Whether strong or weak, everyone’s reasoning contributes to this shaky world, bringing about real good and bad.

Moments later, Chen Ping An awoke from his dreams again, sitting up suddenly, drenched in sweat.

Ah Liang didn’t turn around, saying, “This won’t do. You’ll have inner demons later.”

Chen Ping An raised his arm to wipe the sweat from his forehead, his expression grim, and lay back down, closing his eyes.

Ah Liang remained silent.

Still alone, he continued drinking.

Perhaps feeling uncomfortable sitting on the threshold, he changed positions, squatting down to drink.

Years ago, on the Treasure Bottle Prefecture, the man in the bamboo hat tricked that muddy-legged boy into drinking.

In truth, there are never carefree wine immortals; there are only drunks who are dead drunk and those not yet dead drunk.

On the city wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the swing was no longer present.

A certain sword immortal no longer hesitated to eat a bowl of plain noodles.

When the foreign sword immortal Yuan Qingshu fell in battle, he was spirited and proud.

Before and after the death of Han Huizi, the head of the Taihui Sword Sect from North Ju Lu Prefecture, there were no words.

An old white-haired woman stood at the entrance of Ningfu, murmuring softly, “Old dog, old dog. Come back and guard the door.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 779: Two Swordsmen

A-Liang stood up, hearing the distant sound of a horn echo across the battlefield—the wild lands had called back their troops.

Both sides began to clear the battlefield, marking the end of this grand conflict, perhaps without the need for a horn to signal the next. 

A-Liang made his way to the pavilion at Dragon Slaying Cliff, loosening his grip on the empty wine gourd in his hand. He spun around once, let out a loud shout, and kicked the gourd out of the pavilion, where it shattered on the training ground below. 

With the battle momentarily over, the sword cultivators atop the city walls returned home like migratory birds, their sword lights painting a picturesque scene. 

They would retreat to their secluded meditations, nurse their wounds, forge swords, and indulge in wine. 

The deceased had passed, and the survivors’ sorrows would gradually dissolve in their cups, whether through heavy drinking or subtle sips, all would be resolved over the table.

A-Liang recalled an esteemed figure once saying at the table that a person's belly is the best wine vat in the world; the stories of old friends are the finest raw wine, mixed with the bitterness of life, allowing the joys and sorrows to brew the most exquisite of wines, rich in flavor.

After a moment of contemplation, he patted his thigh and realized that this esteemed figure was none other than himself.

It’s no good being overly modest; he needed to change that.

Before long, a group of sword cultivators flew back from the city walls to Ning’s residence. Ning Yao suddenly dropped down swiftly, landing at the main entrance to converse with the elderly matron.

The others—Chen Sanqiu, Diezhang, Dong Huafu, Yan Zhuo, and Fan Dache—continued straight to the pavilion, gracefully landing and sheathing their swords.

A-Liang leaned against a pillar of the pavilion, one foot poised on the ground, watching the tall and graceful woman with a sigh, “Diezhang has grown into quite the young lady.”

Diezhang smiled and called out, “A-Liang!”

Back in her youth, Diezhang often accompanied A-Liang on the streets, both worrying about their circumstances. The men fretted over how to scrape together money for wine, while the young girl was troubled by how to avoid being sent to buy it. Each purchase would yield just enough coins for a bit of travel money—copper coins clashing in a ragged pouch. If she could add even a couple of silver pieces, it would create the most delightful sound in the world. Unfortunately, A-Liang had borrowed too often, and many tavern keepers feared her presence.

Dong Huafu asked, “What do you mean she’s grown?”

A-Liang grinned, “Ask your mother.”

Dong Huafu chuckled, “Diezhang, my mother says you helped her choose that name—clearly with ill intent.”

A-Liang sighed, “What does that even mean? Your mother should read fewer of those frivolous novels. With all the books in your family’s library, who knows how many unscrupulous merchants in Nan Bosuo have been supported. The printing is poor, and the content is crude—none of those ten books can be read a second time. And your sister, what was she thinking tearing out all those important pages? Using them for toilet paper?”

Dong Huafu fell silent. He was complicit in that matter; his sister had flipped through the books with reckless abandon while he merely helped tear them, and then she secretly bound them into volumes.

Chen Sanqiu kicked off his boots and sat cross-legged, appearing relaxed as he leaned against the railing.

He liked Dong Huafu, while Dong Huafu liked A-Liang. Yet, that didn’t deter Chen Sanqiu’s admiration for A-Liang’s carefree spirit, nor his gratitude for A-Liang’s past actions.

For instance, A-Liang had once had a fierce argument with the great sword immortal on Chen Sanqiu's behalf, lambasting the Chen family head, Chen Xi. However, he never mentioned it to Chen Sanqiu, who only learned of the behind-the-scenes events later, long after A-Liang had left the Sword Qi Great Wall, wearing a bamboo hat and carrying a sword, quietly returning to his homeland.

Some sword immortals, though skilled in swordsmanship, lived constrained and uneasy lives.

Ironically, the freest of them all, A-Liang, often said that true freedom had nothing to do with being unburdened.

“Fat Yan” was busy giving a shoulder rub to one of the men, then quietly asked, “A-Liang, how’s my swordplay now? If I go to the lofty realm, will I make the fairies’ hearts leap? You once said, as long as it’s a sword immortal, even if they’re not that handsome, once they draw their sword, it’s the best makeup for women. When they see skilled swordplay, they react like they’ve put on blush. Is that for real?”

A-Liang nodded, “Of course it’s for real. How could it not be? I know the lofty realm quite well. If you ever get the chance to travel there, I’ll give you a map marking all the mountain peaks with fairies. Don’t go asking about swords; just fly to the foot of the mountain, circle it once while showing off your swordsmanship, finish your display without saying a word, and leave a gourd for the fairies to drink from while you walk away. Only after that, you can recite a poem loudly and exit gracefully…”

Yan Zhuo looked distressed, “A-Liang, I can’t recite poetry.”

A-Liang replied, “I have a book with over three hundred verses, all tailored for sword immortals like us. Want to buy it at a friend’s price?”

Dong Huafu chimed in, “Haven’t you already worn out the verses in that book?”

A-Liang sulked a little.

Fan Dache was the most reserved.

He wasn’t familiar with A-Liang. Even though A-Liang was approachable, Fan Dache still felt he was on a different level—close yet distant.

It’s like how many young sword cultivators felt towards veterans like Dong Sanqian and Lu Zhi; while the elders might not look down on the younger generation, the juniors often felt inferior.

A-Liang smiled, “You must be Fan Dache, right?”

Fan Dache nodded eagerly, feeling flattered.

A-Liang continued, “You’ve entered the Golden Core realm earlier than both me and the great sword immortal expected.”

Fan Dache couldn’t believe it. Did he really catch the eye of A-Liang and the great sword immortal?

A-Liang smiled, “Actually, the great sword immortal has been watching every child grow. It’s just that he’s rather shy and doesn’t enjoy pleasantries.”

That was a tricky statement to respond to.

After all, he wasn’t just a simple tavern keeper.

Once Ning Yao parted from Bai Momo, she walked along the stone path of Dragon Slaying Cliff. Upon reaching the pavilion, she found A-Liang already seated with everyone.

Ning Yao looked a bit weary and asked, “A-Liang, is he alright?”

“That kid has been restless, so I knocked him out. He’s better now, snoring like thunder,” A-Liang explained honestly. “Chen Ping’an should find it hard to get back into the fray any time soon. You should have stopped him from fighting in that last skirmish; it was too dangerous. We can’t let him develop a habit of gambling with his life.”

Ning Yao shook her head, “He’s set on his path; I can’t dissuade him.”

A-Liang clicked his tongue in amazement, “Is the Ning girl still the same Ning girl I knew?”

Ning Yao sat silently, leaning against the pavilion pillar.

She carried a sword case and wore a flowing white robe.

Inside the pavilion, casual chatter ensued.

Mostly it was Dong Huafu asking A-Liang about the exploits of the Qingming Realm, while A-Liang boasted about how remarkable he was there, claiming that his punches against the second-tier Daoist were no big deal since no winner was declared, but that he had dazzled Bai Yujing without even drawing his sword—a feat not everyone could achieve.

His lighthearted talk concealed deeper issues that were hard to let go of.

Finally, A-Liang gave some pointers on swordplay, addressing the bottlenecks and obstacles each young cultivator faced, then stood to take his leave. “I’m off to find someone for a drink; you all should hurry home.”

Ning Yao stood to see A-Liang and all his friends depart on their swords.

She walked down Dragon Slaying Cliff alone to her small residence. Gently, she pushed open the door and stepped over the threshold, sitting beside Chen Ping’an’s bed. She softly grasped his left hand, which was inexplicably protruding from the blanket, still trembling slightly—a sign of his unsettled spirit and lingering unease. Ning Yao moved gently, placing his hand back beneath the covers. She bent down, wiping the sweat from his forehead with a finger, smoothing the slightly furrowed brow.

Chen Ping’an liked her, and that made Ning Yao happy.

But for Chen Ping’an to like her, it meant he had to carry this burden, which made Ning Yao a bit angry with herself.

Thus, just as Chen Ping’an’s brow relaxed, hers furrowed again.

What to do? She couldn’t not like him, and she couldn’t bear for him not to like her either.

These feelings of melancholy settled over her brow and into her heart.

A-Liang returned directly to the city walls, but instead of heading to the straw hut, he sat down next to Wu Chengpei, who was diligently practicing swordsmanship.

Wu Chengpei gazed out at the battlefield, where the golden river had been gathered by the three Daoist saints. On the ground, there were still some sporadic skirmishes.

His expression bore no trace of sorrow; humans often carried unspoken grief.

For many of the newly arrived sword cultivators exploring the outer lands, the local sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall often appeared eccentric and hard to approach.

A-Liang remained silent.

Finally, Wu Chengpei spoke, “I heard from Mi Hu that before Zhou Cheng died, he said, ‘Living isn’t much fun, so let’s die and see.’ Tao Wen said it was refreshing to die, a rare moment of ease. I envy them.”

A-Liang replied, “Indeed, not everyone gets to choose how they live; often, they can only choose how they die. But I must say, a good death is not as good as a bad life.”

Wu Chengpei said, “In the years you were away, all the foreign sword cultivators, whether dead or alive now, regardless of their realms, have left a deep impression on me. I have no more grievances with the lofty realm.”

A-Liang took out a jar of celestial wine, uncorked it, and gave it a gentle swirl. The aroma wafted up, and he leaned down to sniff it, smiling, “A year of autumn passes in the wine; its taste outshines that of osmanthus every year. The wines of the lofty realm and Qingming Realm can’t compare to that of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Wu Chengpei suddenly asked, “A-Liang, have you ever truly liked a woman?”

A-Liang thought for a moment and was about to respond when Wu Chengpei shook his head, “No need to answer; I regret asking already. I’d probably regret even more after hearing your answer.”

A-Liang chuckled, “Traveling the world, what’s the point of not having a bit of romance? Look at those infatuated folks; aren’t they all just drunken fools steeped in wine? In matters of love, everyone’s a coward.”

Wu Chengpei was surprised; this rare moment of seriousness from A-Liang was unexpected.

Lu Zhi made a rare appearance, sitting on the other side of Wu Chengpei.

A-Liang tossed the wine gourd over, but Lu Zhi batted it back with a hand. A-Liang complained, “What’s with the formalities with your older brother A-Liang? It’s just a jar of wine.”

Lu Zhi raised her arm.

A-Liang sighed, took out another jar of new wine, and tossed it over, “Women warriors shouldn’t sweat the small stuff.”

After drinking, Lu Zhi asked, “I’ve heard that there’s a long-standing lineage of sword immortals in the Qingming Realm. How do their sword techniques compare to that of the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain?”

A-Liang rubbed his chin, “You’re referring to the head of the Grand Xuandu Sect, right? I haven’t crossed paths with him; it’s a bit of a regret. The female Daoists from the Xuandu Sect… oh wait, no, it’s the peach grove of that temple—whether it’s crowded or not, it’s always a stunning sight. As for the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain, I’m quite familiar with him. The nobles from the Tianshi Mansion are always exceptionally warm when it comes to hosting guests—quite a spectacle.”

It’s customary to start with a thunderous greeting before any conversation.

A-Liang shifted Wu Chengpei’s head aside and grinned at Lu Zhi, “If you’re interested, when you visit the Tianshi Mansion, just mention my name.”

Lu Zhi scoffed, “Mention your name? Isn’t that tantamount to asking for a duel with Longhu Mountain?”

A-Liang laughed heartily, “The Sword Qi Great Wall knows me best, and no one knows me better than Lu Zhi.”

Wu Chengpei said, “Both of you, I’m here to practice sword techniques, drink, and chat. I’ll take my leave now.”

Lu Zhi replied, “When the heart dies before the person, no good sword can be forged.”

Wu Chengpei said, “No need for you to worry about me. I know that even if I stop forging, my flying sword ‘Ganlin’ will still rank in the top three. Your master sword ‘Dacheng’ only places in the second tier. The records from the Summer Palace are quite clear.”

Lu Zhi replied, “Just let me finish my drink first.”

Wu Chengpei urged, “Please drink quickly.”

Sword immortal Wu Chengpei isn’t adept at dueling, but he’s known for not fearing anyone within the Sword Qi Great Wall. In his time, A-Liang had suffered quite a bit under Wu Chengpei’s hands.

A-Liang waved his hand dramatically towards two elder sword cultivators sitting at the north and south ends of the city wall, calling out, “Place your bets! Cheng Quan, Zhao Ge Yi, come place your bets!”

But Lu Zhi had already stood up, tossing the wine gourd over the city walls before taking off on her sword.

After Lu Zhi departed, A-Liang remarked, “Lu Zhi used to see everyone as outsiders, but she’s changed a lot. You rarely get to hear her speak to you like that; how come you don’t appreciate it?”

Wu Chengpei looked lost in thought, “Hearing familiar words can be painful.”

A-Liang nodded, “That’s true.”

Wu Chengpei said, “You’ve heard about Xiao Shen, right?”

A-Liang reclined, resting his head on his hand, and crossed his legs, “Everyone has their ambitions.”

Wu Chengpei suddenly said, “For the past events, I never got to say thanks or offer an apology. Today, I’ll do both. I’m sorry, and thank you.”

A-Liang replied, “In other realms, sword cultivators like us, skilled in swordplay and good-looking, are highly sought after.”

Wu Chengpei was indeed a handsome man, often paired with Mi Yu as “the twin jewels” in the conversations of many foreign women.

One was infatuated, while the other was sentimental.

Having seen the appearances and poise of the two jade-purity realm sword cultivators, many foreign women felt they had not wasted their journey, realizing that men could also be this handsome. Beauty is not solely for women.

Wu Chengpei placed his sword across his lap and gazed at the distance, softly saying, “Walk to where the water ends, and sit to watch the clouds rise.”

Wu Chengpei then asked, “What if I add ‘mountain’ in front of ‘watch the clouds rise’? Would it resonate better with the water?”

A-Liang casually replied, “No, too many words dilute the meaning.”

Wu Chengpei pondered for a moment, then nodded, “That makes sense.”

A-Liang smiled, “Since when did you start to appreciate elegance?”

Wu Chengpei replied, “I had some free time and flipped through the poem collection of the Hundred Swords Immortal; it was quite interesting.”

A-Liang asked in confusion, “What's that?”

Wu Chengpei chuckled, “You don’t recognize the character for ‘bi’? How can you call yourself a scholar? Didn’t your father die of anger from your ignorance?”

A-Liang grinned, “Your father is the one close to death.”

Wu Chengpei stretched lazily, smiling slowly as he said, “A gentleman's heart is as clear as the autumn sky; a gentleman’s friendship is united in purpose and parting without harsh words. A gentleman’s actions are like wild grass in the morning dew—coming and going, all delightful.”

A-Liang blinked, “Did I say that?”

Wu Chengpei laughed, “Those are words of learned men.”

When Chen Ping’an regained consciousness, he could move freely and learned that the wild lands had ceased their siege, yet he still didn’t feel much lighter.

Unable to find Ning Yao, he found Bai Momo teaching martial arts at the Summer Palace. Chen Ping’an then flew his sword to the Summer Palace, only to discover A-Liang sitting at the threshold, chatting with Chou Miao.

Chou Miao and Dong Bu De were familiar faces to A-Liang, but for outsiders like Lin Junbi, A-Liang was merely a name—everyone had heard of him, but no one had seen him.

A-Liang had spent over a hundred years at the Sword Qi Great Wall, so for the younger cultivators in the lofty realm, all they had were tales passed down orally.

Jiang Shangzhen from the Northern Jiulu Continent had many stories, but A-Liang, having traversed three realms, had even more.

The two landscape paintings spread out in the Summer Palace could not reach the battlefield beyond the golden river, so during A-Liang’s earlier two sword strikes, none of the sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage had witnessed them, only feeling the aura from gathered information, leading the younger cultivators like Lin Junbi and Cao Jun to be even more restrained upon seeing A-Liang in person compared to Fan Dache.

Song Gaoyuan, from Fuyun Continent, was even more excited, his face flushed, yet he didn’t dare speak.

Since childhood, he knew that his lineage’s female ancestor had deep feelings for A-Liang. At that time, young Song Gaoyuan, naive and bold, had asked many taboo questions. The female ancestor shared many old stories, and he remembered well how she felt both grievances and anger whenever she talked about A-Liang. It wasn’t until much later that he understood that expression was what true affection looked like.

Guo Zhujiu squatted beside the threshold, resting her chin on her hands as she stared intently at A-Liang.

She was too young and had never seen A-Liang before.

Today, she wanted to steal a few more glances to make up for it.

Occasionally, Guo Zhujiu would turn to glance at the old girl and then look at Deng Liang, who had affections for the old girl.

A-Liang felt a bit unnerved under the gaze of the little girl who refused to forget to carry her bamboo box.

The young girls at the Sword Qi Great Wall were no longer timid.

Whenever their eyes met, the little girl would immediately grin, making A-Liang feel a rare sense of awkwardness, and he couldn’t help but smile back.

This made A-Liang think of that little rascal, Li Huai—the epitome of innocence in a small town.

Guo Zhujiu noticed Chen Ping’an and immediately bounced over, her expression turning anxious, wanting to say something but hesitating.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “It’s fine; take your time to recover.”

Guo Zhujiu nodded vigorously, then pointed at the threshold and whispered, “Master! He’s alive, A-Liang is alive!”

Chen Ping’an ruffled the little girl’s hair, “Forgot? I’ve known Elder A-Liang for a long time.”

A-Liang gave a thumbs-up, grinning, “You’ve got a good apprentice.”

Guo Zhujiu returned the gesture, then felt it wasn’t enough and raised another thumb, “My master has met a good senior!”

A-Liang echoed, “Little girl has a good eye.”

Guo Zhujiu maintained her gesture, “Sister Dong has a good eye!”

A-Liang said, “Sword Immortal Guo has good fortune.”

Just as Guo Zhujiu was about to continue talking, she received a playful smack from her master and had to withdraw her hands, “Senior, you win.”

Finally, Guo Zhujiu strutted into the house.

Chen Ping’an and A-Liang sat side by side at the threshold.

Two swordsmen, two scholars, began to drink together.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 780: Not a Character in the Book**

Two outsiders, sipping on local wine.

Ah Liang was the first to speak, teasingly saying, “Recovering this quickly? The physique of a pure martial artist is indeed impressive.”

The healing of muscles and bones, the stabilization of a chaotic soul, and the nurturing and repairing of his life sword—all three processes were happening at an astonishing speed that even Ah Liang had not anticipated.

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Hanging by a thread, I still feel a bit anxious.”

It wasn't just the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall who would, for various reasons, secretly send messages to the military camps in the wild lands; among the demon army, there were also cultivators who would leak information to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

After this battle, the five talented sword cultivators from the Jia Shen Camp had already provided a detailed assessment of their combat strength to the Summer Palace.

Of course, the young Hidden Official had two life swords as his trump card, and it was certain that many military camps in the wild lands were already aware of that.

Ah Liang joked, “You can’t just look at the thieves eating meat and ignore the thieves getting beaten; I understand that.”

For any outsider, finding a foothold in the Sword Qi Great Wall was no easy task.

Ah Liang knew this well from his own experience.

He stood up and stretched lazily. “Let’s go. I’ll take you around the city. One's heartstrings can’t always be taut.”

Beside him, Chen Ping'an, without realizing it, had been breathing according to the “rules” since he started gathering herbs as a child.

To breathe is to live—that's a fundamental principle. Almost all cultivators start their journey toward longevity by diligently practicing the art of breathing.

The elder from the Liyu Cave Heaven, a highly respected figure, had taught Chen Ping'an a breathing technique in his early years. It wasn’t particularly sophisticated or high-ranking, but it was steady and orderly, akin to food supplementation rather than medicinal supplementation. Though it became second nature to Chen Ping'an and didn’t burden his physique, it brought long-term benefits, like a gently flowing spring nourishing the heart. 

However, cultivation remained cultivation, and being human remained being human. The distinction between the two was clear, as if every step taken adhered strictly to the rules, ensuring daily harvests. Such restraints on the heart could be a good thing, but they could also make a person seem dull. Thus, the young boy from Mud Bottle Alley had always given an impression of being mature beyond his years.

After learning fist techniques, every time Chen Ping'an traveled alone in the Jianghu (rivers and lakes), he liked to deliberately control his breathing and footsteps, masquerading a high level of skill with a low level of ability. He could always handle it effortlessly, appearing more seasoned than the old veterans—not merely due to talent.

Chen Ping'an stood up and asked with a grin, “Can I bring along a little follower?”

Ah Liang nodded, “Then one for each of us.”

Chen Ping'an called over Guo Zhujiu, who still considered herself his little disciple. However, at just thirty years old, Chen Ping'an was still young for a cultivator, almost like a child in the bustling world. It was unlikely that Guo Zhujiu would become a disciple of the Falling Star Mountain.

Guo Zhujiu hoisted her book box onto her back, holding a hiking staff.

Ah Liang then called for the young sword cultivator Song Gaoyuan from the Deer Antler Palace on Fuyao Continent. The Deer Antler Palace was the top immortal sect of Fuyao, where several of the living founding masters were women, leading to a multitude of female cultivators. As a result, the male cultivators from Deer Antler Palace were particularly envied by others.

Known for their water-based magical powers, the Deer Antler Palace controlled a large part of a river flowing into the sea. Within their jurisdiction were the well-known tourist spots of Jealous Woman Ferry and Rouge Ferry, where women would disrobe their makeup and don plain skirts and wooden pins to cross the waters, lest the water goddess stir up trouble. Conversely, at Rouge Ferry, women were required to apply makeup to appear stunningly beautiful before they could safely cross.

The Deer Antler Palace never interfered, as long as the two waters didn’t harm anyone; the two whimsical water goddesses were allowed to establish their odd rules based purely on personal preference.

Having traveled through the Deer Antler Palace for several years, Ah Liang had, of course, visited both places and found the two water goddesses to be amiable companions—one lively and the other shy, both good girls.

As for the chance encounter at the Deer Antler Palace, it occurred one moonlit night when Ah Liang had promised to bring a gift to the water goddess of Jealous Woman Ferry, helping that poor girl restore her broken appearance. He ventured into the forbidden Lotus Pond, where every lotus leaf had extraordinary uses. Countless dissatisfied female cultivators had longed for a single lotus leaf from the Deer Antler Palace, which was priceless and could not be bought.

The restrictions within Deer Antler Palace were quite interesting; at that time, Ah Liang could only crawl along, twisting and turning to sneak to the pond’s edge. With his rear in the air, he was about to pluck lotus leaves when he suddenly spotted a girl sitting on a massive green lotus leaf, staring wide-eyed at the scruffy man who was foraging for lotus seeds. Noticing her, Ah Liang extended his hand, asking if she wanted to try some.

The girl was hospitable, and a magnificent water spell came crashing down upon him.

Old memories could be recalled.

The four of them left the Summer Palace on foot. Chen Ping'an, always observant, noticed a subtle shift in the expressions of Dong Buding and Pang Yuanji among the group earlier. He wondered what Ah Liang had discussed with them before his arrival.

As they exited the main gate, Song Gaoyuan, gathering his courage, asked with a flushed face, “Ah Liang, will you come to our Deer Antler Palace again in the future?”

Ah Liang chuckled, “Speak up. Which of your senior masters still remembers me after all these years? I can’t guarantee whether I’ll go to the Deer Antler Palace or not.”

Out of respect for his elders, Song Gaoyuan quietly communicated with Ah Liang, “It’s the Master Rongguang who often mentions you.”

In fact, that elder who had distanced herself from the mortal world for over a hundred years would always visit the lotus pond every time she exited her seclusion, frequently murmuring that lotus seeds had a bitter taste that could nourish the heart.

Indeed, indeed. Ah Liang sighed, “It’s her, huh?”

Song Gaoyuan hesitated for a moment and softly said, “Before my travels, Master Rongguang instructed me to say one thing to you if I saw you at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Ah Liang was silent.

Song Gaoyuan continued, “Master Rongguang wants to convey to you, ‘At that time, it was thought to be ordinary.’”

Ah Liang scratched his head and didn’t say much more.

Song Gaoyuan didn’t dare press Ah Liang. 

Some things simply couldn’t be reasoned; making it difficult would only complicate matters further.

As they casually wandered towards the city, they passed by two private residences of sword immortals. Ah Liang introduced one residence, saying its foundation was a plaque made from the refined jade of a poetical inscription by a sword immortal, while the owner of the other residence loved collecting ancient inkstones from the Haoran world. However, both of the former owners of these residences had passed away; one was completely deserted, while the other housed three young disciples who had been taken in by a sword immortal. They weren’t allowed to leave the residence until they achieved the Nascent Soul stage. 

Ah Liang gazed at the walls of that private residence and sighed, “Such earnest care, indeed.”

Chen Ping'an had an odd expression.

The three Golden Core sword cultivators within that residence were all men and could not leave. It was said they were even forced to wear women’s clothing, an oddity of the Sword Qi Great Wall. They had once sent a message requesting to go out and fight, but the Hidden Official lineage discovered that the deceased sword immortal had made a written agreement long ago with the Summer Palace, which bore the name of the late sword immortal and a tiny palm print—likely the work of the previous Hidden Official, Xiao Xian.

Chen Ping'an could only give up, politely declining the request of the three Golden Core sword cultivators.

In the Sword Qi Great Wall, the rules regarding the entrusted affairs of fallen sword immortals were paramount; once it was set down on paper, it had to be upheld, with no room for negotiation.

On the other side of the wall, a young sword cultivator peeked out, sporting a young face but a scraggly beard, and began cursing at Ah Liang.

Ah Liang shot back, saying he had merely shared an anecdote with their master, and it was not his fault if their master wanted to imitate him.

The young sword cultivator angrily retorted, “You dare not come in and have a fight?”

Ah Liang jumped up and spat in that direction.

Chen Ping'an rubbed his forehead, unable to bear watching.

He suspected that the quarrel techniques of the old sword cultivators Cheng Quan and Zhao Ge in the city were learned from Ah Liang.

Then the man noticed Guo Zhujiu, who was wide-eyed beside him, and Song Gaoyuan, as if frozen in place. He quickly tidied his hair and muttered to himself that he had lost his composure.

When Chen Ping'an inquired, he finally unraveled the mystery behind the Sword Qi Great Wall’s case; it turned out that the old sword immortal had a peculiar magical ability, adept at identifying seeds of swordsmanship. In reality, nearly half of the young talents currently thriving in the Sword Qi Great Wall were recognized by that old sword immortal. The prestigious families like Tai Xiang Street and Yu Hu Street were fine, but in the alleys of Lingxi and Suolisi, should a promising sword cultivator sprout up, they would inevitably be overlooked. It was not only sword cultivators in the world; all Qi practitioners, in fact, would achieve greater success the earlier they embarked on their cultivation journey. 

Take Diezhang, for instance; he was discovered as a good seedling through the techniques taught by that sword immortal. Many future sword immortals had initially appeared inconspicuous and hidden, not revealing their talents at a young age.

Once, while drinking with the gravely injured old sword immortal, Ah Liang casually recounted a story about a scholarly family in the Haoran world. The ancestor repeatedly failed the imperial examinations and returned home in frustration, personally teaching his family’s male descendants, forcing them to wear women’s clothing and study hard. If they failed to gain a title before the age of forty, they had to wear women’s clothing continuously, which initially became a subject of ridicule but eventually resulted in the remarkable achievement of six scholars and three received honorary titles.

Ah Liang chuckled, “Doesn’t that sound ridiculous? It caused those three young talents to be ridiculed for decades, to the point where they thought that as long as they could go out and wield their swords, they would be willing to die on the battlefield to be freed from it.”

Ah Liang continued, “The sword techniques of that elder lineage were always about harming others and oneself, making it easy for them to have short lives. Becoming a sword immortal is quick, but dying after becoming a sword immortal is just as quick. When the elder was alive, he could still protect some of his disciples, but once he was gone, it didn’t matter if he had three disciples or thirty; with such a fighting method, the situation would be the same as the desolate house ahead—no one left.”

“To take in disciples is to regard them as one’s own children, which becomes a burden; every master or preacher must bear some responsibility for their disciples’ lives.”

Ah Liang took down the wine jug and took a sip, smiling, “By the way, let me tell you an old tale: an elder sword immortal once approached my master and asked if that technique could be made public, so that the Sword Qi Great Wall could discover more young talents. My master refused, saying that this technique could not be passed on. Even when Chen Qingdu personally left the city to plead with him, it was in vain. In the end, he sent that elder sword immortal away with a single phrase: ‘Who the hell said that only becoming a sword cultivator is a good thing? Is that what Qi Tingji decided?’”

At this point, Ah Liang laughed, feeling more cheerful than melancholic. “When I privately asked him if it was true that the old sword immortal had come seeking, he replied that it was impossible. If the old sword immortal came seeking, how much face would he have to show? After discussing matters, he would invite the old sword immortal for a drink, and that would be his life’s satisfaction. When I asked what if it was Dong Sangeng who came knocking, he said he would just pretend to be dead.”

Ah Liang finally sighed, “In the Haoran world, there are sword immortals like that, but they’re too few.”

Song Gaoyuan nodded in agreement.

After that, Ah Liang spoke less. 

In truth, he used to dislike discussing serious matters with younger generations. Being young, they shouldn’t have too many worries; the major affairs of the Sword Qi Great Wall should be shouldered by those with higher sword skills.

But times had changed; the future would be an unprecedented situation after ten thousand years. Almost every young person in the Sword Qi Great Wall, even children, was now deeply involved. Each of them had to grow up quickly; the momentum was immense, and worries came regardless of age.

The group arrived at the entrance of the Guo Family on Yu Hu Street. Chen Ping'an asked Guo Zhujiu to go home and then had Song Gaoyuan, who had voluntarily taken his leave to return to the Summer Palace, greet all the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, allowing them to wander freely for the next two days to relieve their minds.

Song Gaoyuan glanced back at their figures.

That Ah Liang had quite a name in the Deer Antler Palace. When he had been pursued by Master Rongguang and her junior sister, he had never fought back but had kept shouting that he was a close friend of the great sword immortal Xu Dian from Fuyao Continent, requesting the immortal masters of the Deer Antler Palace to spare Xu Jianxian some face. Xu Dian came from the second largest sect in Fuyao and was considered a prominent rising star, having become a Nascent Soul sword cultivator at a young age. However, the cultivators of the Deer Antler Palace were known for their independence. Despite Xu Dian’s promising future, he was still not a true sword immortal, and his status was not high. Furthermore, the palace master was one of the ten most respected figures of Fuyao, known for her kindness to her junior sister Rongguang, so the man’s desperate plea for help was utterly useless. In the end, he managed to escape without leaving his name, but he certainly didn’t hold back on poetry.

Afterward, the Deer Antler Palace sent a flying sword to Xu Dian's sect, along with a portrait of the man, demanding to know his origins and whereabouts.

Xu Dian was bewildered, having faced an unwarranted disaster as a swordsman, and quickly replied that he did not know the man in the portrait.

Consequently, an ancestor from Xu Dian’s sect, who frequently mingled with mortals, although appearing youthful, had long since returned to a simple state, actually possessing a cultivation level higher than that of the palace master. After learning of this matter, he hurriedly flew to the Deer Antler Palace, saying, “Xu Dian doesn’t know him, but I do! I’m good friends with Ah Liang!”

Outsiders only knew that this elder had come down the mountain with a red and swollen face, cursing loudly, and after leaving the gates of the Deer Antler Palace, he shouted, “Ah Liang, you owe me a drink!”

As a child, Song Gaoyuan could no longer hold back and boldly asked Master Rongguang what it was that Ah Liang did to endear himself to her.

Master Rongguang pondered for a moment, shook her head, and said he hadn’t done anything, yet she simply liked him.

After Guo Zhujiu and Song Gaoyuan departed, Chen Ping'an shared some of his own stories from the mountains and rivers, chatting sporadically about whatever came to mind.

His first visit to the Sword Qi Great Wall involved taking the old dragon city ferry to Osmanthus Island, passing through the Dragon River, and nearly dying, all thanks to his senior brother who saved him with a sword strike.

He lost three matches against his contemporary, Cao Ci, unable to counterattack at all.

In Tongye Continent, he accidentally entered the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, having a genuine adventure in the Jianghu, taking in Cao Qinglang and Pei Qian as disciples, yet he wasn’t sure how to impart his knowledge to Cao Qinglang and worried that Pei Qian was too eager to grow up.

Years ago, he and Diezhang had run a tavern, selling bamboo sea cave wine, which did quite well. It was slower than sitting on a property, but it was steady income. No one believed that the wine had anything to do with the Green God Mountain, so Ah Liang, you have to help speak a few words of truth for the tavern. You’re acquainted with the lady of Green God Mountain; we’re friends, so how can my wine have nothing to do with the bamboo sea cave?

The great demon caught and released in the Catch-and-Release Pavilion on the Upside-Down Mountain had latched onto a young sword cultivator named Bianjing, who was subsequently hunted down and slain by the Hidden Official lineage at sea.

Now, Falling Star Mountain not only had bamboo buildings but also, as per their agreement, established a founding hall at Jisec Peak. Ah Liang, you must visit it sometime.

The two walked through the bustling streets.

Ah Liang was well-acquainted with every corner, listening to the young man’s stories, more often than not just listening and occasionally asking questions that piqued his interest, such as which was more beautiful, the female immortal Huang Ting from Taiping Mountain or Yao Jinzhi from the Great泉 Dynasty.

Chen Ping'an laughed, saying they were all beautiful, but in his eyes, combined, they were still not as good-looking as Ning Yao.

Ah Liang said, “Ning Yao isn’t here right now. Why don’t you say something manly?” Chen Ping'an glanced around, thought for a moment, chuckled softly, but still said nothing.

With the war paused, business in the taverns within the city flourished.

Along the way, Ah Liang and the young Hidden Official passed by some sword cultivators they were familiar with but didn’t exchange much more than nods.

Those who knew Ah Liang weren’t necessarily willing to interact with the young Hidden Official; patrons of Chen Ping'an’s tavern might not dare speak to Ah Liang.

Though the two outsiders shared many commonalities, in the eyes of the local sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the dogged Ah Liang and the dogged second tavern owner didn’t seem alike at all.

Ah Liang didn’t head to Diezhang’s tavern but took Chen Ping'an to a tavern on a street corner.

The place was packed.

All because the tavern keeper was a beautiful woman.

She was a woman whose life sword had been destroyed long ago.

Upon seeing Ah Liang, the woman was very warm, personally bringing wine to the table and scolding the man playfully, saying he was heartless.

Then, she smiled at the young Hidden Official, speaking very casually, “Oh, isn’t this our second tavern owner? Tired of drinking your own wine and looking for a change in flavor? Encountering beautiful women and getting knocked out in one punch—really, what’s the deal?”

Chen Ping'an felt a headache coming on and could only smile in silence.

Ah Liang raised his wine bowl and clinked it with Chen Ping'an’s, then inexplicably sighed, “When I was young and read miscellaneous books, I once saw a famous saying that the heavier the grain head, the lower it bows. But not walking the Jianghu, I didn’t truly grasp it. Only after genuinely traversing the Jianghu did I realize that the full grain head bows low; it truly is wisdom.”

Chen Ping'an had an odd expression.

Ah Liang placed a foot on the bench, grinning mischievously, “What are you thinking? You’ve misinterpreted a good principle, haven’t you?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “What about the rumors between you and the lady of Green God Mountain? Wei Ban spoke very confidently about it; how much of it is true and how much is false?”

Ah Liang laughed, “That little mountain deity from Qizhu Mountain knows nothing.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Outside the bamboo building, once when I mentioned you, Wei Dajun rarely showed genuine emotion and spoke highly of you.”

Ah Liang quickly changed his tune, “As the old mountain deity of the former Shu state, Brother Wei is quite something, and his insights are profound. No wonder when we first met, I felt an instant connection with him.”

What Ah Liang referred to as an instant connection was likely just giving Wei Ban a bamboo sword strike.

At this point, Ah Liang suddenly put down his wine bowl. “The emergence of Liyu Cave Heaven is intricately linked to the many inner workings of the ancient Shu state, not to mention your neighbor from Mud Bottle Alley. Have you thought about it?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I have thought about it.”

“That means you’ve thought about it but haven’t pulled the thread of that hidden connection.”

Ah Liang glanced at Chen Ping'an, feeling helpless; some of the inside information was something Chen Ping'an would never guess, no matter how hard he tried. Ah Liang couldn’t help but shake his head and asked a question, “In your Falling Star Mountain, have you ever seen a seemingly unremarkable outsider cultivator, excluding the monsters and spirits, who definitely has a low level of cultivation, especially one you can be sure has a low level, and this person has a good relationship with Chen Lingjun, whom Lu Chen has his eye on?”

Chen Ping'an mentally reviewed and nodded, “Yes.”

Ah Liang laughed, “Then it seems that your journey from Falling Star Mountain to the Sword Qi Great Wall isn’t all bad.”

Chen Ping'an asked curiously, “Can you tell me why?”

Ah Liang hesitated for a moment, “It’s not that I can’t say, and besides, it's just my guess, so it’s not certain. I suspect that the one who has killed the most dragons might have already placed himself around Falling Star Mountain.”

Ah Liang took a sip of wine. “This person is quite easy to talk to. As long as it doesn’t involve the dragon, any Qi practitioner from the lower five realms could kill him without retaliation. At worst, he could change his identity and continue wandering the world. However, once it involves the last true dragon, he will become a very difficult person to deal with. Even the slightest hint of cause and effect will lead him to slaughter everything in his path. Three thousand years ago, dragons were still the masters of the water transport in the Haoran world, protected by merit. Unfortunately, under his sword, everything is illusory. The Wen Temple has intervened before, but there was no negotiation, no discussion. Lu Chen could be saved, but the same goes for not being saved. In the end, what could be done? It was hard to come up with a compromise. The saints of the Three Teachings could only help this fellow clean up his mess. When your cultivation level is low, you can be stable. However, the higher your level, the more perilous it becomes.”

Ah Liang laughed, “Of course, in this world, there’s no such thing as a truly invincible person. It’s better to know about the more significant matters than to be oblivious. Just know that this person exists; that’s enough. I still say what I’ve said; you can’t handle it.”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

On one hand, it was about matters beyond his comprehension, and on the other, the worst outcomes had not come to pass. Moreover, he was destined not to return to the Bottle Continent, so overthinking was pointless.

Then Ah Liang seemed to start boasting, giving a thumbs-up to himself, “If a conflict really arises in the future, just report my name, Ah Liang. The higher the opponent's level, the more effective it will be.”

In general, those who were actively called “brothers” by Ah Liang, like that sword cultivator Xu Dian from Fuyao, were typically those who had been thoroughly taken advantage of by him and were people he didn’t particularly like.

After that incident, whenever Xu Dian ventured down the mountain, he would find no one willing to befriend him among the female cultivators of Deer Antler Palace. The female Qi practitioners there had a wide social circle, leading to most of the female cultivators across half of Fuyao disliking Xu Dian. As his mischievous master once said, those who had been doused with a bucket of filth by Ah Liang would be remembered as such, even if they cleaned up afterward.

However, if one were to report their name and dare to claim to be friends with Ah Liang, then in almost every sect of the Haoran world, they might still be unwelcome, but that name could ward off many disasters and unexpected events.

Ah Liang inexplicably exclaimed, “You and Ning Yao are looking more and more like a couple.”

Chen Ping'an raised his wine bowl and suddenly turned to ask the tavern keeper, “Do you have any complimentary side dishes to go with the wine?”

That didn’t sound much like Ning Yao at all.

Regarding Chen Ping'an and Ning Yao, Ah Liang had long felt that they were a perfect match. Back then, one was still Ning Yao of the Sword Qi Great Wall, while the other was a young boy just starting out in the Jianghu.

A girl who didn’t want to think too much encountered a boy who wanted to think of everything; could there be a more fitting situation than this?

Not all men realize that the beloved person beside them is their one and only match in the world over millennia.

The tavern keeper smiled, “Our little business can’t compare to the flourishing trade of the second tavern owner. Besides, the second tavern owner not only runs the tavern but also sells wine and picks up treasures everywhere; would he lack money?”

Chen Ping'an could only smile in response.

Ah Liang looked at Chen Ping'an across the table and slowly said, “When a person can only do a few things, they can’t possibly express deeper reasoning. Even if they’ve read books and can articulate it, if others don’t listen, doesn’t that mean they haven’t spoken at all? Isn’t that the case?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “The times we need to reason with others are often precisely when reasoning has become ineffective; the latter stealthily precedes the former, leading to helplessness in worldly matters.”

Ah Liang laughed, “Isn’t that boring?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not at all. It’s interesting. The more like this it is, the more we should live well and strive to make the world a little more stable.”

Then Chen Ping'an took a big swig of wine, his demeanor calm and his eyes bright, “Just like a person, as long as their drinking capacity is good enough, they can drink away the worries in their wine bowl without needing to drunkenly speak to others.”

Ah Liang laughed heartily, very pleased.

Because, in the now-present Chen Ping'an, he saw the shadow of another person.

The one who hadn’t traversed the Jianghu—the young man with hope placed upon him—had already helped traverse quite a distance.

Chen Ping'an suddenly said, “Although I haven’t been to the Wild Lands, I know that on the battlefield, many of the demon race who died under my fist and sword are, beyond the battlefield, a substantial portion of them are weaklings—truly powerless weaklings.”

Ah Liang laughed, knowing what the kid was trying to say. Chen Ping'an seemed to be speaking about himself, yet he was actually comforting Ah Liang.

Chen Ping'an continued, “Once the Sword Qi Great Wall is breached, those genuine weaklings from the Wild Lands will also become powerless strongmen.”

Ah Liang, on the contrary, was less appreciative, laughing as he asked, “Then should they die?”

He was, in fact, one of the people who understood the customs and practices of the Wild Lands the best.

Ah Liang even had friends like Liu Cha out there beyond the battlefield; apart from Liu Cha, Ah Liang knew many cultivators from the Wild Lands, who had long since become no different from ordinary people.

Chen Ping'an had already downed two bowls of wine and filled a third. The tavern's wine bowls were slightly larger than those in his own tavern; he had known to buy them by the bowl.

Chen Ping'an finished the third bowl in one gulp, shook his head, and said, “I just lack the ability; otherwise, who would dare approach the Sword Qi Great Wall? All the great battlefield monsters could be killed with one punch or sliced down with one sword. To hell with the great monsters… If I ever have the chance to return to the Haoran world, for everyone who harbors compassion for the Wild Lands while having the luck to remain uninvolved, I see one…”

He burped, then began refilling the wine again. The habit of drinking had originally been instilled by Ah Liang. As for what would happen if he saw one, he didn’t finish his sentence.

Ah Liang didn’t stop him.

He merely smirked and said, “What do you think you can do when you see those people? They have their own reasoning; after all, no one forced the Sword Qi Great Wall to kill so many people.”

Chen Ping'an paused drinking, hands in his sleeves, leaning against the wine table. “Ah Liang, tell me, what would you do? I want to learn.”

Learning from others’ strengths had always been Chen Ping'an’s strong suit.

When it came to accounts, he had learned a thing or two from Zhong Kui at a small inn on the border of the Great泉 Dynasty.

As a package dealer, secretly picking up scraps was an actual skill. What sort of realm should it be, he had seen broad horizons while traveling with Daoist Sun on Bei Ju Lu Continent.

Even long ago, a casual remark by Lin Shouyi, implying that when out in the world, one can manage affairs but shouldn’t meddle too much, had increasingly resonated with Chen Ping'an as time went on.

Even earlier, many experts regarded Chen Ping'an’s handwriting as “overly crafted, lacking spirit,” unknowingly, it all stemmed from the three pieces of paper that Lu Chen had gifted him.

Back then, Lu Chen had mentioned three matters, but only clearly stated two, including the advice to pick up snake gall stones and try his luck. When Chen Ping'an had asked a question, Lu Chen hadn’t revealed the last point, which turned out to be learning to write.

Ah Liang laughed, “I don’t care at all.”

Chen Ping'an was left speechless, recalling those “heart voices” he had heard in the Dragon River and the subsequent events after the heavenly tribulation in Suijia City.

Chen Ping'an reached out from his sleeve, took a sip of wine, and with one hand holding the bowl and the other scratching his head, he mused, “That’s a bit hard to learn.”

Ah Liang laughed, “No need to learn.”

Once one ascends the mountain to cultivate, looking up, the sky isn’t far away.

For a cultivator, the closer they get to the mountain peak, the less patience they have for worldly matters.

There were exceptions, but they were few.

Ah Liang also worried that Chen Ping'an would become one of those mountain deities.

Just like regarding Chen Ping'an's learning to write, Ah Liang wasn’t unaware of Lu Chen’s deeper intentions in gifting him the prescription. He merely wondered why Chen Ping'an’s talisman drawing was so smooth. It felt as if there were no barriers, as if he leaped right over them. 

One should know that the talisman path, regardless of whether it was a Taoist Qi practitioner, was seen as a chasm, akin to sword cultivators—failure was failure.

However, this matter was something Ah Liang couldn’t openly disclose; Chen Ping'an had to figure it out on his own.

Just because one is skilled in swordsmanship doesn’t mean they find all worldly affairs easy. There’s no such good fortune, and Ah Liang was no exception.

As the two drank, the pace slowed; Ah Liang wasn’t in a hurry, as he had a good capacity for alcohol, and Chen Ping'an wanted to drink more.

That tavern keeper had a long-standing relationship with Ah Liang and sent a platter of side dishes over from the tavern, jokingly saying she wouldn’t charge him.

Thus, the two ended up drinking until the sky darkened and the surroundings became increasingly sparse. During this time, several sword cultivators, who had been proactive in their pleasantries, came and went, sitting down to drink, ensuring they remembered to settle their bills.

So, by now, all they needed to pay for was a jug of wine on the table.

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, no one judged a sword cultivator’s ability to drink based solely on innate capacity.

Ah Liang’s face was already flushed as he pointed at one of the bright moons in the sky and smiled at the tavern keeper, saying, “Thank you, sister! I’ve been there; believe it or not?”

When out in the world, it’s acceptable to call someone younger “sister” or “girl.” For women older than oneself, regardless of whether they’re a few years or several hundred years older, one should always call them “sister”—that’s a good habit.

The tavern keeper glanced at the bright moon and directly replied, “Is there a mother?”

Ah Liang waved his hand, “You little girl, always saying playful things.”

The tavern keeper retorted, “It’s closing time. Finish this jug of wine and get lost quickly.”

After finishing their last jug of wine, Ah Liang and Chen Ping'an got up to leave. Chen Ping'an took out money to pay the bill, but the tavern keeper, who was somewhat of a rival, smiled and waved, saying, “Chen Ping'an, let this one be on me.”

Chen Ping'an didn’t ask why and pocketed the snowflake coins, thanking her.

The two walked on the dimly lit streets late at night, their steps somewhat swaying, unable to shake off the alcohol’s effects.

Approaching the Ning residence.

Ah Liang said, “Chen Ping'an, remember, we are not in the White Paper Blessed Land, and the people around us are not characters from a book. Remember, this doesn’t count as a skill, and you must remember it even more in the future.”

Chen Ping'an responded affirmatively.

Ah Liang suddenly declared confidently, “I won’t tell Ning Yao about the fact that I didn’t spend money on the wine. And about how beautiful Huang Ting and Yao Jinzhi are—I'm even less likely to mention it.”

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands behind his head, “You think I’ll be scared if you say that? What a joke! Ah Liang, I’m really not bragging…”

At the entrance of the Ning residence, a figure appeared, and the young Hidden Official immediately took a deep breath, dispelling his drunkenness and instantly shaking off the effects of the alcohol. He hurriedly ran up the steps, a hand behind his back, signaling the man behind him to cool off on his own, and ran up to her, standing still. “I’m sorry for being late! I didn’t drink much, really; Ah Liang kept persuading me, and I said it didn’t matter that I was injured, but it didn’t work. I won’t do it again next time!”

Ah Liang stood there, ears perked to listen to the exchange, his jaw dropping in disbelief. The second tavern owner was certainly not just a name; he had surpassed expectations.

Ning Yao turned to look at Ah Liang.

She had dismissed him.

Ah Liang turned to leave, muttering, “It’s the first time I’ve ever had a drink without paying at the tavern of a lady from the Sword Qi Great Wall. I can’t believe it!”

At the entrance, Ning Yao didn’t speak.

Chen Ping'an felt a bit guilty.

Ning Yao completely ignored Ah Liang’s complaint, merely staring at Chen Ping'an.

He seemed to have grown a bit taller.

She stood on her tiptoes, aligning her eyes with his.

Chen Ping'an tilted his head, squinted, and smiled, “Quick, tell me who you are. If you keep being this cute, I might just start disliking Ning Yao for liking you.”

Ning Yao remained silent.

By the time Chen Ping'an finally understood, Ning Yao had already turned to leave.

On the walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Wei Jin was compelled to use the technique of observing the mountains and rivers, with the scroll depicting the entrance of the Ning residence. Ah Liang pounded his chest in frustration, “What a foolish kid, just dazed.”

The great sword immortal stood with his hands behind his back, bending slightly to gaze at the scroll, nodding, “He truly is foolish.”

Originally somewhat reluctant, Wei Jin now chuckled in agreement, “The second tavern owner really lacks emotional intelligence; he’s truly ruining the atmosphere.”

Ah Liang cleared his throat and gently pushed Wei Jin’s hand aside, “Wei Jin, you, a dignified sword immortal, are doing such things? Isn’t that a bit lacking in chivalry? Does your conscience not hurt?”

The great sword immortal turned to leave, “It shouldn’t be.”

Leaving behind just a sword immortal who had been diligently practicing in the Frost and Snow Temple.

On the walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Ah Liang sat cross-legged, “Can we swap someone else in, perhaps me?”

Chen Qingdu shook his head, “No.”

Ah Liang retorted, “Isn’t my realm higher?”

Chen Qingdu replied, “At our level, having a realm means nothing. It’s excusable if you didn’t understand before, but do you still not understand now?”

Ah Liang fell silent.

The great sword immortal spoke plainly but with profound meaning.

The two were quiet for a long time, with Chen Qingdu sitting beside Ah Liang.

Ah Liang was somewhat surprised.

The great sword immortal rarely did this.

Chen Qingdu softly said, “I'm a bit tired.”

But the elder smiled and added, “Sword cultivator Chen Qingdu is fortunate to meet all of you sword cultivators.”

Ah Liang laughed heartily, “Say that loudly! Say it louder!”

Chen Qingdu glanced sideways.

Ah Liang immediately acted mischievous, “If I’m drunk, I can’t say such things, can I?”

Chen Qingdu softly remarked, “I wonder what the scene will be like ten thousand years from now.”

Ah Liang replied, “It’ll always leave people disappointed yet hopeful, I suppose.”

Chen Qingdu nodded, “That’s very comforting.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 781: Shoulders and Hearts

Under the bright moon, wealth and poverty hold no significance. The moonlight visits without knocking at the door, wandering through Jade Staff Street (Yuhu Street) and Beauty and Ugliness Alley (Yanchi Lane) alike.

The sun chases away evil spirits, especially during the warm winter days that feel like cotton jackets, as it shines upon Beauty and Ugliness Alley and Jade Staff Street.

Chen Ping'an sat alone in the pavilion at Dragon-Slaying Cliff for an entire night, but ultimately, he lacked the courage to knock on Ning Yao's courtyard door. Damn that liquid courage—what good was it if it didn’t help?

By the time the sun reached its zenith, Chen Ping'an flew out of the city on his sword, heading towards the Summer Retreat Palace. The local sword cultivators, including Chou Miao and Dong Bu De, were absent. Besides Pang Yuan Ji, who was no longer around, the foreign sword cultivators like Deng Liang had gone to pay respects to their respective sword immortal seniors back in their hometowns, or to catch up with old friends. In the end, only Lin Jun Bi and Pang Yuan Ji remained to play chess together. Chen Ping'an observed silently, knowing Lin Jun Bi's skills were a notch above Pang Yuan Ji's, and the outcome was inevitable. After watching for a while, he went to the archives to rummage around. 

Eventually, Lin Jun Bi approached him, saying that the great sword immortal Mi Hu had specifically requested to see the Hidden Official. However, this great sword immortal was quite respectful and showed no intention of entering.

Chen Ping'an gestured for Lin Jun Bi to continue their game while he went to the entrance, where he met Mi Hu. Mi Hu was the elder brother of Mi Yu, the leader of their Hidden Official lineage, and the latest and youngest sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists and smiled, “What a rare guest.”

Without much pleasantry, Mi Hu got straight to the point, saying, “Let’s walk and talk.”

As they walked side by side, Mi Hu candidly stated, “Chen Ping'an, I’m looking for you today because I have a favor to ask. It’s both a public and a private matter.”

Chen Ping'an replied with a smile, “Feel free to speak.”

Mi Hu continued, “I hope that once the war is over, my brother, who is currently in the Upside-Down Mountain, can go wherever he wishes, such as your Haoran World.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “His military achievements should be sufficient. However, Mi Yu is still a Jade Purity Realm sword immortal. According to unwritten rules, every sword immortal's fate needs to be acknowledged by the top sword immortal. Only then can our Hidden Official lineage finalize it, and at that point, outsiders would have nothing to say.”

Mi Hu said, “The top sword immortal has already given his nod.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Since the top sword immortal has agreed, then Mi Hu doesn’t actually need to discuss this with me. Mi Yu’s path is secure. In the Haoran World, a sword immortal of such rare worth can go anywhere they please, as long as they wish to. In the immortal ancestor hall on the mountain or the Golden Luan Hall in the royal dynasty below, they would be honored guests wherever they go.”

Mi Hu responded, “I still can’t help but worry about my brother. If he has no one to look after him in that foreign land, I won’t feel at ease. Cultivating on the mountain in the Haoran World is different from sword training in our Sword Qi Great Wall. Although I’ve never been there, I’m well aware that it’s fraught with intrigue and deception, a real den of thieves. Mi Yu’s dealings with women are decent, but if he gets entangled in some nonsense argument over the Dao with a cultivator, my brother is too naive and would suffer greatly.”

Chen Ping'an understood that this sword immortal was asking him, as an outsider to the Haoran World, to pay more attention.

Yet, there were certain things, such as the agreement with the top sword immortal and his own future circumstances, that Chen Ping'an couldn’t reveal in advance. So he had to carefully consider his words.

As for whether Mi Hu’s words were indirectly insinuating something about him, Chen Ping'an was magnanimous enough to treat it as the wind passing by his ears.

Mi Hu added, “As long as you’re willing to give your approval, I will be extremely grateful. Think of it as a business deal; I trust you, the shopkeeper.”

There was some misunderstanding there.

Chen Ping'an didn’t clarify, saying, “Let’s set aside the gratitude. Mi Yu has accumulated quite a bit of military merit during his two years in the Hidden Official lineage. You don’t need to offer anything extra. However, the success of this matter ultimately hinges on what Mi Yu thinks as well.”

Mi Hu frowned, “With the connections the Hidden Official has in the Sword Qi Great Wall, even if my brother is unwilling to leave, you could easily find a few sword immortals to knock him unconscious and take him to Haoran World.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “If he gets to Haoran World but can’t let go of his burdens, wouldn’t that complicate his cultivation journey? Holding the identity of a sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall while cultivating there might not lead to many incidents, but even one could be a significant problem.”

Mi Hu firmly stated, “Living is more important than anything. To live even one more day is worth it. Besides, don’t underestimate my brother’s resolve; it’s not as fragile as you think.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “That’s true.”

He continued, “Let’s send Mi Yu to North Julu Continent, to the Taihui Sword Sect or to the Floating Water Sword Lake of Sword Immortal Li Cai. Both places need a sword immortal to serve, and Mi Hu wouldn’t have to worry about fighting there. Eventually, let Mi Yu choose where he wants to go.”

Mi Hu expressed confusion, “Why not send him to your mountain?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I have a pile of old debts. Even if Mi Yu leaves Upside-Down Mountain to go to Ruined Mountain, he wouldn’t find peace in a few days, so there’s no need for that.”

Mi Hu insisted, “Then let Mi Yu go to serve at your Ruined Mountain, paying respects and putting up offerings.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Mi Hu, you’re a straightforward person, so I’ll speak plainly. If it were just a simple transaction, only a fool would refuse a sword immortal’s service. I consider your brother a friend and don’t want him getting involved in murky waters in Baoping Continent. In North Julu Continent, where the ties to the Sword Qi Great Wall run deepest, Mi Yu’s identity will serve as the best protection; no other continent offers such an advantage.”

Mi Hu retorted, “Stop rambling like a woman. Mi Yu will go to Baoping Continent, end of discussion!”

So much for reasoning with the great sword immortal Mi Hu—he had to resort to insults?

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to speak some words of moderation, he was taken aback when Mi Hu suddenly began to complain, “A bunch of drunken old bachelors who don’t know what it means to have a woman, how dare they laugh at my brother? They’re like a bunch of men who’ve been run over by a cart! How can they compare to my brother? These bachelors can’t take their eyes off women’s ample chests and backsides. What pathetic creatures…”

Chen Ping'an turned to look at Mi Hu.

How could Mi Hu have the audacity to say that about others?

Realizing the younger Hidden Official’s gaze, Mi Hu, being a great sword immortal, quickly adjusted his tone, saying, “There are some people who aren’t bachelors but act worse than one. Before I came here, I heard someone was drinking with A Liang at Miss Xie’s tavern without spending a dime. I also heard that after opening for business today, Miss Xie was smiling brightly, as if she had become a different person.”

Chen Ping'an smiled back, pretending he didn’t understand, while inwardly he took out a small ledger, recording this little debt against Mi Yu. He would definitely send a letter back to Ruined Mountain, demanding that Mi Yu endure a whole year of illusions and not earn a decent amount of spring rain money before being allowed to leave the mountain.

The two of them arrived at a nearby private residence of a sword immortal called the Zongyu Immortal Pavilion, which had an unusual foundation. The former owner was a sword immortal who had refined a piece of poetic inscription from the Flying Moon. However, the private residence had been abandoned for many years. Most sword immortal residences outside the Sword Qi Great Wall were like this; when a sword immortal passed away and their direct disciples also perished, leaving no descendants to maintain the lineage, it would become a vacant lot. It would then be reclaimed by the Hidden Official lineage according to regulations, to be rented out or gifted to new sword immortals.

For instance, the private residence of the Taihui Sword Sect, known as the Armor Library, was acquired through military merits. The female sword immortal Li Cai first rented the former residence of a sword immortal, known as the Wanhe Residence, but she eventually desired the nearby Pavilion of Floating Clouds, which was entirely carved from a piece of immortal jade. She was willing to pay a sky-high price to acquire it, but the Summer Retreat Palace refused initially due to regulations, infuriating her. She directly flew her sword to send a message to the young Hidden Official, scolding Chen Ping'an thoroughly.

Later, when the war escalated and divine money became scarce, Chen Ping'an instructed Dong Bu De to notify Wanhe Residence that if the price was doubled, they could purchase the entire Pavilion of Floating Clouds.

When the ferry from Osmanthus Island reached Upside-Down Mountain, it brought along several boxes of divine money from the Jiang family of the Yu Gui Sect.

Mi Hu stopped, noticing someone flying down from a distance, seemingly looking for the young Hidden Official beside him. 

It was the middle-earth sword immortal, Ku Xia.

Mi Hu then conveyed his thoughts through their shared consciousness, “Chen Ping'an, thank you for the task today.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I will do my best.”

Having received the promise, Mi Hu glanced at the sword immortal Ku Xia, then tossed a sword nurturing gourd to Chen Ping'an, saying, “Crafted using ancient methods, its quality is decent,” before soaring away from the city.

Chen Ping'an took the ice-cold sword nurturing gourd and decided to pass it along to Mi Yu later.

Ku Xia approached Chen Ping'an, his face troubled, which only intensified his frown.

Chen Ping'an hung both sword nurturing gourds at his waist, a good omen, and asked the sword immortal from the Shao Yuan Dynasty, “Is Lin Jun Bi leaving?”

Ku Xia nodded, “I realize it’s not the right time. So within half a month, a ship from Central Continent will express some goodwill to the Summer Retreat Palace. It’s a gesture from our Shao Yuan Dynasty.”

Chen Ping'an felt a bit helpless.

Indeed, sword immortal Ku Xia was a straightforward person.

To be honest, if Lin Jun Bi hadn’t chosen to stay with the Hidden Official lineage, he could have left the Sword Qi Great Wall long ago.

If Lin Jun Bi were to leave, any sword cultivator from the Summer Retreat Palace would think it perfectly reasonable.

However, with Ku Xia’s words, it felt as though Lin Jun Bi’s departure would paint him as ungrateful, to the point that the national teacher from the Shao Yuan Dynasty, who was also Lin Jun Bi’s mentor, would have to spend money to appease the Sword Qi Great Wall for Lin Jun Bi’s return home.

But as for the heavenly materials and earthly treasures and divine money from the Shao Yuan Dynasty, Chen Ping'an welcomed it without hesitation, the more the better.

Thus, he didn’t take advantage of the honest person and directly suggested going to the Summer Retreat Palace to call Lin Jun Bi out to meet with sword immortal Ku Xia.

However, Ku Xia didn’t move, looking toward the Zongyu Immortal Pavilion’s main door, asking, “Hidden Official, do you know the origin of this residence’s name?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Not quite.”

In truth, during his years as the Hidden Official, he had enjoyed perusing the many sealed archives of the Summer Retreat Palace as a form of leisure. 

The last owner who renamed the residence to Zongyu Immortal Pavilion was a woman—a rare literate sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall who shared a fondness for planting immortal flowers, much like Guo Jia. She had once entrusted the Upside-Down Mountain to purchase a elm tree from Fu Yao Continent, which was then transplanted into her small garden. It unexpectedly bloomed high above the eaves, delighting the sword immortal, who then decided to name the residence accordingly. However, once the sword immortal passed away and there were no disciples, the residence fell into disrepair over the years. The Zongyu Immortal Pavilion, with its additional layer of immortal prohibitions, would not allow outsiders to intrude. As such, no one knew whether the interior had withered or flourished, whether flowers bloomed or withered.

Ku Xia said, “The first time I traveled to the Sword Qi Great Wall with a friend, my friend admired a disciple of this sword immortal. Yet, due to the rigid customs, they couldn’t become immortal partners.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “If your friend had stayed, wouldn’t they have been able to become a couple?”

Ku Xia’s expression darkened further as he sighed, “How many sword cultivators in the Haoran World are unencumbered mountain and wilderness cultivators? Even if they start out that way—like Deng Liang from Aiai Continent—they will ultimately be taken in by the grand sects’ ancestral halls. Moreover, my friend has been heavily relied upon since childhood as a lineage teacher. The weight of their sect’s favor is not something they can simply discard. Within the sect, there are elders that my friend respects greatly.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “It’s indeed difficult to have it both ways.”

Ku Xia said, “That’s why my friend and I both hold the Hidden Official in high esteem.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Sword immortal Ku Xia, if you can’t lie, then don’t.”

There were no friends or sword immortal disciples; it was clearly Ku Xia himself who was the one infatuated with the female sword immortal.

Ku Xia, feeling helpless, said, “During that farewell trip to Nan Po Sha Continent, everyone urged me, including Yu Juanfu and Jin Zhenmeng, among others, as if I had accomplished some great feat. I genuinely felt guilty and didn’t deserve their admiration.”

Chen Ping'an said, “If sword immortal Ku Xia speaks up, do you think Yu Juanfu and Zhu Mei would respect you even more?”

Ku Xia appeared bewildered at first, then slowly realized, and finally felt somewhat relieved. “It’s better not to say anything. As an elder, discussing such romantic matters with juniors is inappropriate.”

Chen Ping'an posed a question, “The owner of Zongyu Immortal Pavilion, back then, aimed to accumulate military merits but ended up dying in battle. Do you harbor any resentment towards the top sword immortal, or towards the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Ku Xia shook his head, “Without the Sword Qi Great Wall’s soil, how could I have met someone like her?”

This was Ku Xia’s heartfelt truth. He bore no hatred towards the Sword Qi Great Wall; if there was anyone to blame, it would be his own helplessness.

Chen Ping'an nodded.

With Lin Jun Bi and Ku Xia present, Chen Ping'an's impression of the Shao Yuan Dynasty improved a little.

A Liang had unraveled a mystery yesterday, and now sword immortal Ku Xia had solved another enigma today.

Suddenly, Ku Xia asked, “Hidden Official, didn’t you say you were unfamiliar with this place?”

Chen Ping'an replied earnestly, “I previously said, ‘not quite clear.’ As a Hidden Official, it’s my duty to know a little about the Zongyu Immortal Pavilion right under the nose of the Summer Retreat Palace.”

Ku Xia felt exasperated.

If he were dealing with scholars from the Ya Sheng lineage, things wouldn’t be like this.

Leading sword immortal Ku Xia back to the Summer Retreat Palace, Chen Ping'an called out, and the white-clad youth Lin Jun Bi gracefully stepped out, exuding an aura of immortality.

Upon seeing sword immortal Ku Xia, Lin Jun Bi immediately understood the purpose of their visit and clasped his fists in silence.

At this moment, leaving the Summer Retreat Palace and the Sword Qi Great Wall, shedding the burdens of the Hidden Official lineage, would inevitably raise suspicions of shirking responsibility. For instance, Deng Liang and Cao Gun would likely feel this mental burden. However, Lin Jun Bi would never entertain such thoughts.

Chen Ping'an patted Lin Jun Bi's shoulder, saying, “Parting on good terms isn’t easy. Take care.”

Lin Jun Bi stood tall and clasped his fists again, saying, “In the years spent beside the Hidden Official, I’ve learned a great deal and benefited immensely. Jun Bi will remember this. A gentleman must focus on his foundation; once the foundation is established, the Dao will naturally arise!”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Let’s skip the pleasantries and focus on doing practical things. As for the agreement from years ago, I will certainly fulfill it for you.”

Lin Jun Bi instantly understood, his face filled with sincerity as he said, “Hidden Official, your expertise in chess is renowned. The chessboard and box shall remain at the Summer Retreat Palace.”

Chen Ping'an gave Lin Jun Bi a hearty slap on the shoulder and smiled, “It seems Jun Bi has learned some real skills.”

Sword immortal Ku Xia felt a sense of relief.

He had previously worried that the young Hidden Official might intentionally make things difficult for Lin Jun Bi due to the connections with the national teacher of the Shao Yuan Dynasty and the young sword cultivators.

It appeared he had underestimated the young Hidden Official’s character.

Ku Xia took out a sealed letter and handed it to Lin Jun Bi, saying, “Jun Bi, barring any unforeseen circumstances, you should leave tomorrow on a returning ship from Nan Po Sha Continent. This letter was just sent by your teacher via flying sword to Chun Fan Zhai at Upside-Down Mountain.”

Lin Jun Bi would definitely remain at the Summer Retreat Palace today; otherwise, there wouldn’t be anyone familiar at the residence of sword immortal Sun Ju Yuan in the city. Moreover, sword immortal Sun currently had a very poor impression of the young sword cultivators from the Shao Yuan Dynasty. After the frontier incident, it wouldn’t make sense for Lin Jun Bi to go and make a fool of himself.

Furthermore, Lin Jun Bi had maintained good relations with all sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage, especially with the cheerful Cao Gun and Xuan Can, with whom he had grown very close.

Guo Zhu Jiu had been urging the three of them to cut off chicken heads and burn yellow paper, saying she had prepared everything and was just waiting for the three of them to bow!

Before leaving, Ku Xia reminded Lin Jun Bi to be cautious on his journey back.

Instead of directly returning to the city, sword immortal Ku Xia strolled over to the Zongyu Immortal Pavilion.

With a face full of distress, the elder gazed at the residence, lost in thought for a moment before breaking into a smile.

Lin Jun Bi returned to the Summer Retreat Palace and continued the unfinished chess game with Pang Yuan Ji, which had already been decided.

Pang Yuan Ji chuckled, “Is this our last game?”

Lin Jun Bi asked, “Shall I let you win this time?”

Pang Yuan Ji replied, “If you let the Hidden Official help you with chess, there’s no need to let me win.”

Chen Ping'an, observing from the side with his hands tucked into his sleeves, remarked nonchalantly, “I’ve played proper chess with others and have never lost a single match.”

Pang Yuan Ji asked, “How many matches have you played?”

Chen Ping'an shot him a sideways glance, “Why do you care?”

Pang Yuan Ji gently returned a piece to the box, saying, “I’ll just leave it.”

Lin Jun Bi’s eyes brightened, “Sounds good.”

Chen Ping'an also felt relieved and took out the sword nurturing gourd gifted by Mi Hu to examine it carefully. For now, he was still its owner.

At the bottom of the sword nurturing gourd, the words "Hao Liang" were inscribed.

The material of the sword nurturing gourd was unknown, and it was unclear what Mi Hu meant by “decent quality.” 

Pang Yuan Ji turned to Chen Ping'an and said, “If I recall correctly, Mi Hu picked this up from the corpse of a Nascent Soul realm demon on the battlefield years ago. After acquiring it, Mi Hu never had anyone verify its quality, so it’s hard to say.”

Chen Ping'an stared intently at the sword nurturing gourd, nearly pressing his face against it, casually stating, “I can’t say how good a good thing is, but if it’s not good, I can tell as soon as I hold it. You wouldn’t understand; this is a matter of talent and expertise.”

Pang Yuan Ji didn’t want to continue that topic and changed the subject, “How did you survive that ambush by five people? Even sword immortal Chou Miao said he might not have escaped.”

The five who had surrounded him were top talents: Zhu Zhen, Li Zhen, Yu Si, Tan, and Liu Bai.

The curiosity surrounding the young Hidden Official wouldn’t be limited to Pang Yuan Ji alone.

Many things about the young Hidden Official remained a mystery; knowing only the surface, even if you had seen it with your own eyes or heard it with your ears, didn’t mean you understood.

For instance, many speculated that Chen Ping'an’s life-bound flying sword could isolate a small world, but even if it was a small world, there were distinctions, with varying divine abilities.

Chen Ping'an put away the sword nurturing gourd and hung it back at his waist. After Lin Jun Bi put away the chess pieces, he was drawn into Chen Ping'an’s proximity.

Chen Ping'an didn’t elaborate on the specifics of the ambush but merely told Pang Yuan Ji and Lin Jun Bi about the flying swords and methods of the other five.

If they needed to fight side by side and leave the city for a battle, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t mind sharing more inside information. Since it wasn’t necessary, however, saying more would be pointless.

After all, being honest with someone doesn’t mean pouring out your heart all the time. If one side opens up too much and the other fails to catch it properly, it could hurt both parties.

Lin Jun Bi asked, “So, it seems that Liu Bai’s life-bound flying sword is the most dangerous?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “If you encounter her in the future, be extra cautious. Once she reaches the upper fifth realm, her life-bound flying sword will be deadly; it could be quite troublesome.”

If that ambush had purely been a contest of strength, several of them would have perished there.

Speaking of which, Chen Ping'an chuckled, “But for now, we’re unlikely to meet her. So in that transaction, I didn’t gain much, but I didn’t lose too much either.”

Lin Jun Bi lamented, “This strange and bizarre flying sword, I’ve never heard of anything like it before. Previously, I only knew that some sword immortals have particularly delicate life-bound flying swords, but nothing as extravagant as Liu Bai’s.”

Chen Ping'an remarked, “In this vast world, there’s no shortage of wonders.”

Using his ability to traverse space, Chen Ping'an directly moved from the Summer Retreat Palace to the Cold-Weather Palace.

He didn’t find Grandma Bai, who usually taught boxing, but instead encountered an unexpected guest.

It was Guo Zhu Jiu, who had brought a bamboo box. Instead of staying home, she had come to the Cold-Weather Palace early in the morning, and now she was on the training ground, enthusiastically describing the thrilling ambush.

Guo Zhu Jiu hadn’t witnessed the ambush herself, and since Chen Ping'an had been recuperating at Ning’s residence, he hadn’t spoken a word to her, so her storytelling was purely fictional and fabricated.

However, Chen Ping'an didn’t stop her. He sat far away on the railing, allowing his disciple to play the role of a storyteller.

When it came to boxing, Guo Zhu Jiu was indeed a true disciple.

With one leg raised in a pose of a golden rooster standing on one leg, she spoke solemnly, “The situation was dire—five sword cultivators were bloodthirsty, each wielding life-bound flying swords of the highest quality, at least as tall as two Yuan Creation realms! Were you afraid? I know I was! Just think about it—Li Zhen is a disciple from Tuo Yue Mountain, and Zhu Zhen is the top disciple of Liu Cha, while Liu Bai is a direct disciple of the old fox Zhou Mi! What kind of backing do these three have? Not to mention Yu Si and Tan, who were able to stay at that Jia Shen tent—they must not be simple characters, right? Otherwise, at such a young age, how could they rise to the ranks of the hundred sword immortals of the barbaric world? But it’s fine; it was just a drizzle, nothing major. My master remained calm in the face of danger; just like that, his aura was intimidating! You all are martial artists; you should know that every stance of a martial arts grandmaster carries great significance…”

Chen Ping'an truly couldn’t listen any longer. Moreover, his disciple’s posture lacked any semblance of grandeur or masterful demeanor.

He quickly rose, leaped to the training ground, and cleared his throat, reminding this well-meaning but unhelpful disciple that it was time to wrap up.

Guo Zhu Jiu turned to see her master and worried that he might be too high-minded to let her speak a few words of truth, so she hurriedly maintained her stance and accelerated her speech, rattling off a few hundred words about the subsequent developments of the battle.

Chen Ping'an walked up beside Guo Zhu Jiu and gently pressed her head down.

Guo Zhu Jiu assumed a posture of deep breathing, “I won’t say anything more; after all, I can only express a fraction of my master’s magnificence. What a pity, what a pity.”

A child named Jiang Yun crossed his arms and asked, “Chen Ping'an, did Sister Guo say you crushed that female sword cultivator named Liu Bai with one punch? Is that true? What’s wrong with you? Facing five sword cultivators, four of whom are male, why didn’t you just take them all down and instead only target the girl? Are you picking soft persimmons to squeeze?” 

At this point, Jiang Yun chuckled, raising his eyebrows repeatedly. “Squeezing soft persimmons? Where did you aim your punch? I’ve heard that the battlefield was quite strange, obscured as if covered by a blanket. Outsiders couldn’t tell who was lying beneath that blanket…”

Guo Zhu Jiu shook her head with a sympathetic look, “Jiang Yun, it seems our relationship is now set in stone.”

Fearless Jiang Yun unexpectedly felt a little anxious, “Sister Guo, don’t! We’re sworn siblings of good fortune; don’t let an outsider spoil our bond! Even if we do have our differences, please don’t come banging on my window later!”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Alright, let’s start practicing. Guo Zhu Jiu, you watch from the side.”

Guo Zhu Jiu obediently stepped aside.

Chen Ping'an frequently came here to help the children practice boxing for an hour.

The so-called “feeding boxing” meant that the children were allowed to strike at him without worrying about any specific techniques.

Jiang Yun glanced at the Hidden Official, “You look like you’re not healing well from your injuries. I’m worried that my punch might knock you down. Be careful; don’t try to act tough. You haven’t seen me in a few days, right? My boxing skills have made great progress, and my punches can cause the heavens to collapse and the earth to shatter!”

Chen Ping'an looked at this child, who had the best martial arts aptitude and an exceptional talent for talking back.

Jiang Yun immediately retreated several steps, taking a stance to prepare for an attack. He kicked off the ground, darting in and out, leaping high to reach the young Hidden Official, and threw a punch.

Chen Ping'an kept one hand behind his back, tilted his head, and with the other hand, gently pushed Jiang Yun's head, sending him crashing to the ground, rolling several times before getting back up.

Following Jiang Yun’s lead, a girl named Yuan Zao Hua followed up with a sweeping kick from behind Chen Ping'an, but he sidestepped and elbowed her down, sending her sprawling as she slid across the ground.

Chen Ping'an’s “feeding boxing” naturally required some pressure, and he had never missed a target.

According to their agreement, whenever Chen Ping'an was hit by a punch, it meant the children were ready to go home.

One child was gently pushed by Chen Ping'an and crashed into another, sending both flying.

One child, who got too close, had his face grabbed by Chen Ping'an, twisting his wrist until both his feet were off the ground, sending him flying.

“Form follows intention, energy flows from the dantian, and intention permeates the whole body. We martial artists stand tall in the world; our punches are as fast as flying swords, and our intent in our punches doesn’t lose to that of sword immortals.”

Chen Ping'an walked slowly, casually punching one child in the neck, causing their head to tilt. He then transformed his punch into a palm, with his palm facing down, slapping the child on the shoulder, making the latter stumble and fall. With a light kick, he sent another child flying, while simultaneously blocking another child's punch, who was now off balance.

“Powerful and vigorous, unbreakable, think carefully about your punches. The intention of your punch must be as fine as a needle; you must think before striking.”

Chen Ping'an stepped aside and punched another child at the back of the head, sending them sprawling to the ground, blood pouring from their nose.

Another child changed trajectories several times, their elbow overlapping their front hand, palms flipping quickly as they combined their moves, closing in on Chen Ping'an with some minor momentum in their punches.

Once again, Chen Ping'an countered every move with his elbows and palms, pushing the child back to their starting position.

Jiang Yun, seeing an opportunity, kicked at Chen Ping'an but was met with a swift kick in the chest, sending him to the ground. As he lay there, Jiang Yun was about to curse Chen Ping'an for taking advantage of his height when he realized that the young Hidden Official had kicked him while leaning back. Jiang Yun wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, bracing himself to get back up.

Any child who approached Chen Ping'an was effortlessly knocked back. One was sent rolling from an elbow to the abdomen, and another was shoulder-checked and sent flying. When the children got back to their feet, they felt as if half their bodies had disintegrated. Still, they gritted their teeth and got back up; generally speaking, punches delivered with a hint of hardship wouldn’t slow them down. 

However, not just them, but all the children practicing martial arts here, along with Jiang Yun, remembered the young Hidden Official’s saying: a martial artist’s body must endure some injuries, or they would be seeking death themselves. If they could get hurt and still punch faster, that was the mark of a true martial artist.

Yuan Zao Hua lunged like an arrow. 

Some children threw wild punches, while others, familiar with one another, tried to work together to land a punch on Chen Ping'an.

One child after another was knocked back by Chen Ping'an, and while they weren’t severely injured, it definitely wasn’t pleasant.

Chen Ping'an continued to walk slowly, “As long as your intention isn’t alive, even if you can forget life and death in martial arts, you’re still dead.”

Chen Ping'an crouched slightly, positioning his hands above a leaping child’s jaw, gently lifting him, sending the child flying ten or more feet away. “Punches must originate from the ground. No matter how good your techniques are, if your stance isn’t steady, how can you leave the ground?”

After a stick of incense had burned, most of the children lay on the ground, with only a few able to sit up; not a single one was standing.

Chen Ping'an stood still and said, “Continue. Punches can be slow, but your intent must be heavier. Otherwise, I won’t hold back.”

The children nearly all swayed as they got back up.

On the side, A Liang and the old woman watched Chen Ping'an teach boxing, with A Liang softly laughing, “The boxing is practical and not difficult, yet it’s hard to execute so beautifully. If they reach the Haoran World in the future, once they throw a punch, it’ll be like entering a garden of a hundred flowers.”

The old woman smiled, “The son-in-law's boxing is indeed quite splendid. His punches and appearance complement each other well. It’s normal for girls to be fond of him; after all, he’s not someone who’ll easily get involved, which makes people feel secure.”

A Liang chuckled, “Does this kid have any shortcomings?”

The old woman thought for a moment and shook her head.

A Liang looked at the children and sighed, “Carrying a burden on the shoulders is just physical labor. But carrying a burden in the heart—what’s the end of that?”

The old woman readily agreed and softly said, “This is something the son-in-law isn’t quite good at.”

Another stick of incense later, all the children lay on the ground this time.

One sharp-eyed child, lying on the ground, caught a glimpse of A Liang from a distance and quickly began to whisper excitedly with the others.

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, “A Liang, why don’t you take over and teach boxing for a while?”

A Liang was eager to try.

His boxing skills were still quite commendable.

He propped himself up on the railing, stood gracefully, took a deep breath, and with a shake of his shoulders, shouted before moving straight ahead, showcasing his exceptionally flowing boxing techniques and footwork between the corridor and the training ground.

Jiang Yun jumped up, wearing a rare serious expression, saying, “Chen Ping'an, let’s continue; you can teach boxing now.”

The other children nodded in agreement.

A Liang stood there, rubbing his chin, thinking this wasn’t right.

My boxing is both beautiful and solid; the Dao Old Second has suffered greatly from it!

Guo Zhu Jiu comforted him gently, “Senior A Liang, your sword techniques are already so high; there’s no need to feel ashamed if your boxing isn’t as good as my master’s.”

A Liang asked, “Did you all see that my boxing skills weren’t high?”

Guo Zhu Jiu vigorously shook her head like a rattle drum.

A Liang tentatively asked, “Is it that I didn’t look good?”

Guo Zhu Jiu sighed, “Senior A Liang, do you want to hear the truth or a lie?”

A Liang replied, “A lie!”

Guo Zhu Jiu immediately beamed with excitement, enjoying the banter with Senior A Liang, which didn’t hurt their feelings and saved her from getting scolded by her master. She raised both thumbs enthusiastically, loudly praising, “Senior, your boxing is incredible, truly incredible, just as good-looking as your appearance!”

A Liang was unconcerned, happy just to hear something pleasant, and asked, “Zhu Jiu, do you want to learn sword techniques? Uncle A Liang isn’t boasting; my boxing skills might not be as good as your master’s, but my swordsmanship, tsk tsk tsk…”

Guo Zhu Jiu shook her head, “I won’t learn.”

A Liang asked, “Why not?”

The little girl took a step in place, swaying her shoulders, her little bamboo box bobbing, “Because I only have one master!” 

*(End of this chapter)*

 ### Chapter 782: The Hairpin

On the training ground, the children once again lay sprawled on the ground, each one bruised and battered. The initial training in martial arts was certainly not comfortable. When it was time to endure hardships, they were enjoying comforts, and when it was time to enjoy, they had to endure.

Having been born in the Sword Qi Great Wall and entering this cold refuge palace to learn martial arts, they had to adapt to the suffering and master a skill.

Not every hardship in the world leads to sweet rewards. The pure martial heart of a martial artist can only be forged through the trials of suffering.

The Hidden Official, dressed in a long blue robe, remained calm and composed, saying, “Take a break for two incense sticks’ worth of time.”

Chen Ping’an sat cross-legged, placing his hands palm-up in his lap, and began to meditate. The children struggled to rise, forming a circle around him, mimicking the young Hidden Official’s posture, closing their eyes, and slowly adjusting their breathing.

When Chen Ping’an opened his eyes, he assessed each child’s punches, commenting on their strengths and weaknesses. He wouldn’t favor Xu Jun just because he came from a prominent family, nor would he scold Zhang Pan for his slow learning due to his weak physique. Every well-executed punch would earn praise, while a tired one would be met with criticism. He wouldn’t go easy on Sun Qu and the tomboy just because they were girls.

In short, Chen Ping’an wanted all the children to remember one fundamental truth: in martial arts, one must first confront oneself.

Learning martial arts begins with becoming a better person. Those who teach, regardless of whether they hold the title of master or teacher, must first educate others. Teaching is not just empty talk; even a village schoolteacher’s nuances can leave a lasting impression on a poor child, while one flattering word from a wealthy man could be dismissed as mere flattery. Everything is remembered, and thus, the profound teachings become overshadowed.

There are truths in both books and life; everyone can be a teacher.

Chen Ping’an fell silent.

According to the rules, it was now time for the children to ask questions.

The child named Xu Gong from Mumen Alley was the first to speak up, “Mr. Chen, a punch travels in a straight line, so it should be the fastest. If practicing stance training is to strengthen the body, why then are there so many different punches?”

Chen Ping’an raised a hand, thrusting out a punch suddenly before suspending it mid-air. “Xu Gong, are you saying that a punch traveling in a straight line reaches the target the fastest, correct?”

Xu Gong hesitated, unsure of his own words.

Jiang Yun chuckled, “One punch and he’s down.”

Who in the Sword Qi Great Wall didn’t know that the young Hidden Official was particularly “gentle” with the fairer sex? Otherwise, how could he have earned the nickname of “One Punch to the Second Shopkeeper”?

As for why he was so ruthless with the wildlings, it was probably because the female sword cultivator was less attractive than the male.

However, Jiang Yun suddenly recalled the scene of Yu Jianfu being pressed down and banged against the wall, sighing as he felt he might have wronged the second shopkeeper.

Xu Gong’s expression turned anxious; he had never meant that. He wouldn’t dare show the slightest disrespect to Mr. Chen.

In Xu Gong’s eyes, Chen Ping’an was like a deity, immaculate and unblemished. When he chatted with his two good friends, they all admired him greatly. Therefore, when Guo Zhujiu was telling stories earlier, they were the three who believed the most.

Coming from Mumen Alley, Xu Gong knew he wasn’t from a prominent family like Jiang Yun. Lacking Jiang Yun’s talent and background, he, along with his friends Zhang Pan and Tang Qu, often practiced their stances secretly at night, sometimes encountering that tomboy Yuan Zao Hua. However, too much practice almost harmed their health.

Chen Ping’an maintained that punching stance, then raised his left hand, using his punching right arm as a path, pointing out the flow of pure energy that travels in a straight punch—from the fist, to the wrist, forearm, shoulder, back, and waist—highlighting each pressure point, thoroughly explaining how this straight punch channels energy. Every muscle, every bone, every tendon was accounted for, and he explained it all to the children, breaking down the various techniques and their subtleties. He clarified how and why to generate force, providing insightful yet accessible explanations.

After retracting his fist, Chen Ping’an rested his hands on his knees and smiled, “Thus, the punch techniques are foundational, the intent of the punch is central, and the principles of punching are celestial.”

Jiang Yun furrowed his brow, “The punch techniques are the least important? But I think the stance and form must come from the techniques; they are very important.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, raising a fist, twisting his wrist to change the punch into a palm, only an inch from the ground, and suddenly slapped the training ground.

The earth trembled, and all the children almost simultaneously bounced up, varying in height and twisting in the air. 

Then, as if crushed by an unseen force, they fell back down, gasping for breath, feeling nearly suffocated, their backs curved, unable to straighten up.

“The punch techniques are foundational; this only refers to position and order. It doesn’t mean they are unimportant; on the contrary, all techniques begin low. Only by building layers upon layers can our techniques rise to the heavens.”

As Chen Ping’an withdrew that intangible essence of the punch, the children immediately felt relieved. He turned to Yuan Zao Hua and Zhang Pan, “Training in martial arts requires constant focus and caution. This is the essence of the teacher leading the way while the student must be vigilant. Yuan Zao Hua, Zhang Pan, you both did well just now, showing that while resting, you were still practicing your stances, though not high off the ground, your sitting posture was stable. Jiang Yun, despite being the lowest off the ground, had a scattered posture.”

Jiang Yun rolled his eyes; he was already used to the Hidden Official’s cold remarks.

The shy Zhang Pan looked excited, while the tomboy’s expression was resolute, her lips pressed tight. After learning martial arts, the girl had changed dramatically. A few years ago at the Sword Qi Great Wall, when she first met the second shopkeeper, who had yet to become the Hidden Official, she was just a cheerful little girl.

Chen Ping’an’s gaze swept over everyone, leaning slightly forward as he spoke, “Learning martial arts is not merely about throwing punches on the training ground. Breathing, footwork, diet, even observing flying birds may seem tiring at first, but with practice, it becomes second nature. Your bodies are a small universe, filled with treasures that belong to you alone. Unless one day you must contend with others for life or death, no one can take them from you.”

Chen Ping’an squinted, “Now the question arises—when your punches are strong, and you decide to strike, how should you face your opponent in a fair contest of life and death?”

Jiang Yun shouted, “One punch to take them down!”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “You little rascal, are you not done playing yet?”

With crossed arms, Jiang Yun replied seriously, “Hidden Official, this isn’t a joke. When a martial artist throws a punch, they must carry the demeanor of being the best in the world. My pursuit of martial arts lies in making my opponent tremble before my fist even leaves my hand.”

Chen Ping’an stood up, “Alright, then I’ll teach you. Hearing you say this reminds me of a match I had. I faced a six-realm opponent with my ten-realm skill. Now, you can use your three-realm against my seven-realm. It’s a four-realm difference; don’t say I’m bullying you.”

Jiang Yun immediately sprang to his feet.

Chen Ping’an pointed to a corner of the training ground, “You stand over there against the wall.”

Jiang Yun swaggered over, turning his back to the others. The children secretly gritted their teeth, wishing they could slap themselves. They could only remind themselves to lose gracefully and not let their faces show defeat.

Chen Ping’an walked to the opposite side of the training ground but suddenly changed his mind. “Everyone, come over here, stand side by side, and don’t lean against the wall—stand three steps away from it.”

The lives these children would lead wouldn’t be regimented; they would only face opponents of similar strength or those a realm or two higher.

Whether it’s him or Granny Bai, in the future, they would help the children strengthen their bodies step by step, but on the path of cultivation, such good fortune wouldn’t always be there. No one wants to be anyone's stepping stone; they all aspire to climb higher and higher, reaching for the peak.

Chen Ping’an had demonstrated how to punch from the peaks of the three to the seven realms.

He had also shown them the punches of the eighth, ninth, and tenth realms.

However, the children, including Jiang Yun, felt that Granny Bai, having dropped from the tenth to the ninth realm, was currently at a higher level, but in terms of the “meaning” behind the punches, the young Hidden Official was still more captivating.

But the previous training had truly been practice; the children were merely spectators.

Today, Chen Ping’an wanted the children to stand on an opposing front, to personally experience what a punch felt like.

Years ago in North Julu Prefecture, the elder Gu You had blocked his path and had once asked for a spar.

The punch had come without warning, and the response had been unprepared. Gu You’s sudden strike had arrived in an instant, and at that moment, Chen Ping’an could only await his fate.

After stopping, Chen Ping’an centered himself, immersing in focus, forgetting the world around him, with no one in front of him.

Jiang Yun, facing Chen Ping’an from a distance, began to sweat profusely, subconsciously warning everyone, “We must bite our teeth and hold our ground; no one can back down, and no one can lean against the wall. Even if we’re scared, we must stand still!”

The girl from Yuhua Street, Sun Qu, trembled, “I’m scared right now.”

Initially, like Jiang Yun, Sun Qu had been one of the children least willing to learn martial arts because she had a sister named Sun Zao, a sword cultivator.

Yuan Zao Hua whispered, “Then just focus on your stance and don’t think about anything else!”

Chen Ping’an didn’t rush to throw a punch.

For those children standing against the wall, this was even more torturous. Since they would eventually face danger, it would be better to get it over with than to be slowly intimidated.

A Liang said, “Guo Zhujiu, when your master teaches others, he’s also practicing himself and refining his mind. This is a good habit; using a shell to create a dojo isn’t a derogatory term.”

Chen Ping’an’s previous martial arts training had been too diverse, and he needed this opportunity to reflect and forge his own path. Sometimes, he needed to think of nothing, as one does when sleeping, to calm his mind. Teaching martial arts, practicing, and cultivating the heart—these seemingly singular tasks were, in truth, three intertwined endeavors.

Teaching martial arts to the martial students of the Sword Qi Great Wall was crucial, but it was even more vital to provide all the children with a relatively stable path of cultivation. For a Hidden Official responsible for the state of affairs, this was a significant distraction. Yet in the end, it turned out not to be a loss.

Guo Zhujiu had long since placed her book box at her feet and had been imitating her master’s punches, remaining busy from start to finish. Upon hearing A Liang’s words, she paused her punches and said, “With so much knowledge from my master, I will learn it all.”

Granny Bai stood by, softly saying, “If your master throws this punch, many children will likely crumble on the spot.”

A Liang laughed, “To truly understand where one’s punches stand is a great thing.”

Back then, Gu You, as the ancestor of the Mountain Shaking Fist, had seen this pure martial artist from another continent, who happened to have his foundation in the Mountain Shaking Fist, and had thrown a peak ninth-realm punch at him.

Chen Ping’an stepped forward, silent as a whisper.

With six steps of stance practice, in the blink of an eye, as swift as thunder, the entire training ground began to tremble, ripples spreading outwards, the air thick with martial intent.

Sun Qu, who had been hoping to resist her fears with a firm stance, found herself shaken back to reality. Her stance faltered, her mind was thrown into chaos, and her face reflected sheer panic.

Jiang Yun felt the overwhelming martial intent enveloping the space, and with a sharp shout, he stomped down hard, setting his stance while using his own martial intent to counter the overwhelming force. Seeing Sun Qu about to fall, he gritted his teeth, shifted sideways, his face contorted in pain, but still stood protectively in front of her. After all, she was a girl, and he felt it was his duty to protect her.

Xu Gong and Yuan Zao Hua called out simultaneously, “Six-step stance!”

All the children seemed to share a connection, almost instinctively advancing instead of retreating, attempting to counter the incoming force with their own stances.

A fierce wind swept over them, martial intent pressing down upon them.

They quickly found that retreating was not an option; they could barely take two steps before stumbling back.

Sun Qu, summoning courage she hadn’t known she had, bypassed Jiang Yun and chose to face the punch directly.

In an instant, together with Jiang Yun, all the others leaned against the wall, their faces pale, sweating profusely, while some of the weaker children had already collapsed against the wall.

Standing in the center of the training ground, Chen Ping’an rested one hand behind him and the other in a fist against his abdomen, exhaling a breath of turbid air.

He quickly turned to wipe away the blood trickling from his nose. Despite the strain of his present physique, even just half a punch was no easy feat.

Chen Ping’an turned and smiled, “Get up, everyone; today’s practice ends here.”

The children were momentarily stunned, some dazed.

After a brief silence, Chen Ping’an suddenly laughed, “After this punch, I must say, my eye for selecting martial seeds is indeed sharp. In the future, should you walk the rivers and lakes and encounter fellow martial artists, you can proudly say your teacher is the tenth-realm martial artist Bai Lianshuang from the Sword Qi Great Wall, and the one who fed you martial arts is Chen Ping’an of the Great Harmony World, with the observer being the sword master A Liang.”

After bidding farewell to Granny Bai, Chen Ping’an and A Liang, along with Guo Zhujiu, left the cold refuge palace on foot.

A Liang said, “Zhujiu, earlier your master mentioned the observer but only referred to me. Did he forget you? Are you hurt?”

Guo Zhujiu replied with confusion, “Master mentioned it; didn’t you hear?”

A Liang was taken aback, “How could I not hear?”

Guo Zhujiu, serious, said, “I said it to myself in my heart on behalf of my master.”

A Liang admired her, “Your sword heart is impressive, Zhujiu.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “A Liang, can you teach me the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops? I’d like to learn.”

A Liang sighed, “I said I’d teach earlier, but Zhujiu didn’t care.”

A Liang ruffled his hair, “But since Zhujiu said my looks and martial skills are both good, such heartfelt words mean I should stubbornly impart this ultimate skill. But no rush; I’ll visit the Guo residence later.”

Guo Zhujiu exchanged a knowing glance with Chen Ping’an, both smiling.

Master, you understand.  
Master, I understand.

Guo Zhujiu didn’t linger; she had sneaked out over the wall today and needed to return home.

After bidding farewell to her master and A Liang, the girl, carrying her hiking staff and a small bamboo box, dashed off.

A Liang and Chen Ping’an made their way toward the stacked hills where a tavern stood.

A Liang asked, “After Tao Wenjian died, did we receive extra celestial coins for his military achievements?”

Chen Ping’an didn’t hide anything, replying, “I took out some too.”

At the tavern, taking stock of the wealth Chen Ping’an had accumulated over the years at the Sword Qi Great Wall from the gambling den and the sales of seals and folding fans, not a single snowflake coin remained. All had been returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall under the name of Tao Wen’s legacy. Of course, it wasn’t because Tao Wen requested it; it was simply Chen Ping’an’s original intention.

This was also the reason Tao Wen entrusted his posthumous affairs to the young Hidden Official.

To catch the eye of a sword saint can never be achieved by merely raking in a fortune or speaking pretty words.

A Liang continued, “With so many celestial coins, that’s no small sum. Are you just going to leave them on the table in the courtyard for sword cultivators to take at will? Can you really trust that?”

With the war currently at a lull, cultivating swords was of utmost importance, and sword cultivators were notoriously unreasonable with money.

This was why so many sword saints at the Sword Qi Great Wall were financially struggling.

The higher the rank of their life swords and the higher their cultivation, aside from a few wealthy families on Tai Xiang Street, no one dared claim they had enough money.

Only when they weren’t in a state of cultivation would sword cultivators have some spare change, drinking and betting casually.

Thus, while most sword cultivators might only take what they needed from Tao Wen’s house, some would inevitably pocket extra celestial coins.

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “No one is watching over there. Tao Wen didn’t care; I don’t either. It’s not a business deal; there’s no need to fuss.”

A Liang nodded. “That’s the way to think about it—be more relaxed.”

Chen Ping’an took off the white jade hairpin from his bun.

A Liang took it, his mind lost in thought, then burst into laughter, “What a sly scholar; you even fooled me back then.”

Chen Ping’an couldn’t be bothered to use his inner voice for this and said directly, “This hairpin changed the tide of battle during my confrontation with Li Zhen. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have won without being a sword cultivator then.”

The white jade hairpin had been unsealed, and A Liang could see its nature clearly. 

Chen Ping’an continued, “Time flows differently here compared to many cave heavens; a month here is like a year in the outside world.”

The white jade hairpin was a peculiar cave heaven, small in area, able to accommodate only over a hundred people, and its spiritual energy was average, hardly qualifying as a treasure land. In fact, it was unsuitable for cultivators to practice.

A Liang sighed, “That old scholar truly cared.”

The old scholar had gone to great lengths for his disciple, Qi Jingchun. 

Using it as a shelter, it could serve as a study—a place to read peacefully. After hundreds of years, as the world changes, perhaps the next time they return to the Great Harmony World, it will be a different scene.

The old scholar’s initial intention was likely to wait until the wild world attacked the Sword Qi Great Wall and for Confucianism to open up the fifth world, creating a new vast realm, expanding the board, providing more space for his disciple Qi Jingchun.

When the old scholar left the Grove of Merits, he had probably made this plan. He was willing to exchange the merits of opening a world for Qi Jingchun to find his place in the mortal realm.

Chen Ping’an said slowly, “If the master is such a master, how could I dare to treat my own disciples carelessly? Brother Mao once said that the most precarious task in the world is to teach, to cultivate, and to educate. Because you never know which of your words will be remembered by a student for a lifetime.”

A Liang returned the white jade hairpin to Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an reinserted it into his hair.

Eight small seal characters read, “In memory of the gentleman, warm as jade.”

A Liang held his hands behind his head, basking in the gentle sun.

The young man beside him, clad in a blue robe, with the white jade hairpin in his hair, wearing layers of cloth shoes, and a sword-gourd hanging from his waist.

Chen Ping’an suddenly asked, “A Liang, did you get hurt in the last two fights?”

A Liang had gone out of the city twice. The first time was fine; even the sword saint stationed at the city wall had seen something.

But during the second return to the battlefield, a powerful demon had attacked with full force, isolating the heavens and earth.

Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but worry.

Unexpectedly, A Liang shook his head, “Not much of an injury; just used some of my secret skills. Next time I go to the battlefield, I’ll definitely be targeted. Just like your two life swords' key techniques, outsiders don’t know, but they are critical. Knowing them, it will be hard to use them again. After all, it’s not like drifting in the Great Harmony World, where I encounter strangers; on the battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it’s quite large yet small. I've become acquainted with those demons; I know their tactics very well. We are contending against the entire wild world, and the issue is that they are not short of magical treasures. Even if they don’t have them, they can borrow them.”

Chen Ping’an was surprised, “You didn’t get hurt at all?”

A Liang chuckled, “Want to see a trick? After witnessing it, you’ll understand why I could escape unscathed.”

Chen Ping’an looked around, “Not in the street, though.”

A Liang complained, “There’s no one around; what’s the point of showing off if it’s just you and me staring at each other?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “If you dare to show it, I dare to learn.”

A Liang halted, lightly tapping the ground with his toes.

Chen Ping’an was puzzled and stopped, waiting expectantly.

Suddenly, from the second floor of a nearby tavern, someone shouted angrily, “You bastard, pay up! I’ve seen scams before, but I’ve never seen someone run off after losing money!”

In an instant, patrons at various tables cheered loudly, clinking chopsticks against bowls and slapping tables, creating a ruckus.

Chen Ping’an, with his hands in his sleeves, remained composed, treating this as a small matter.

A Liang shouted back, “I’m not paying! I’m just helping you save money. Saving money means saving wine—what nerve you have to scold me!”

The old sword cultivator was momentarily speechless.

In a fit of anger, the old sword cultivator was about to spit in that bastard’s face.

But A Liang lightly stomped his foot.

At his toes, golden characters appeared, linking together to form a small circle at A Liang’s feet.

All were teachings from the sages.

Starting with a phrase from the Confucian sage, the first golden circle emerged.

Next came the profound principles of yin and yang as expounded by the Daoists.

After that came the Confucian classics regarding heaven, earth, and humanity, followed by larger circles of poetry and prose reflecting the seasons.

The five elements.  
The twelve hours.  
The twenty-four solar terms.  
The fundamental teachings of the seventy-two sages worshipped in the central land’s literary temple.

Layers upon layers of golden characters arose, innumerable.

The teachings of three religions and a hundred schools, each one representing the words of countless poets, moral sages, famous ministers, generals, sword saints, and heroes, all manifested in writing.

Chen Ping’an looked down, taken aback by the rapid appearance of each golden character, each carrying immense meaning, leaving even him feeling overwhelmed.

In moments, the entire city was covered with dense golden letters.

Chen Ping’an even recognized many of the beautiful phrases he once inscribed on bamboo slips.

He saw many words from Buddhist scriptures and Legalist texts, as well as words written by Li Xisheng on the walls of bamboo buildings.

A Liang’s heart stirred, and the strange phenomenon vanished as he smiled, “Just learn the gist of it. After all, no one can become someone else, nor do they need to. I, A Liang, am A Liang; Xiao Qi is Xiao Qi; you, Chen Ping’an, are just Chen Ping’an.”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

A Liang then turned to the second floor, “What were you shouting just now?”

The old sword cultivator, sincere, said, “A Liang, want to drink? My treat.”

A Liang retorted, “What do you take me for? Am I the type to owe someone money and then ask for a drink?!” 

Yet his eyes were glued to the old sword cultivator, clearly unwilling to leave.

“Absolutely not!” 

The old sword cultivator declared, shaking a hand vigorously. A friend quickly tossed over a jug of wine, which the old sword cultivator caught with both hands, gently tossing it out of the window, “A Liang, my brother, it’s been too long since we’ve seen each other. I’ve missed you. When you have time, I’ll set up a big table at the Second Shopkeeper’s tavern and we’ll drink to our heart’s content!”

After Chen Ping’an and A Liang left with the bottle of wine, the old sword cultivator settled back down, stroking his beard as he chuckled, “Who in the entire Sword Qi Great Wall can demand debts like I can, making A Liang put on such a show just to dodge repayment? You lot are just riding my coattails, so today I won’t spend a penny; who’s paying the bill?”

As A Liang walked down the street, sipping the wine that others insisted on giving him, he suddenly asked, “Have you talked about that big matter with Ning girl?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I’ve told her everything—the reasons and results. I feel that the closer we are, the more we should clarify things.”

A Liang laughed, “No wonder you’re not single; it’s not without reason.”

Chen Ping’an smiled but didn’t reply.

When they arrived at the tavern, it was thriving, far surpassing others. Even with many tables, there were still no empty seats. Countless people were squatting or sitting by the roadside, drinking.

A Liang and Chen Ping’an squatted by the road, a bowl of noodles and a small plate of pickles in front of them.

The surroundings were noisy; the patrons at this tavern were all carefree souls. If they weren’t, they likely wouldn’t return, so they treated A Liang and the young Hidden Official as if they were no big deal.

A Liang cradled his wine bowl, took a bite of the pickles, shivered at the saltiness, and quickly rolled a large bite of noodles.

Listening to some boasting about how good the wine and dishes were, many newcomers eventually felt that the taste of the wine was indeed quite nice.

A Liang wondered, “Am I now a waiter who collects no fees?”

Chen Ping’an held his wine bowl with both hands, sipping slowly, gazing into the bustling street.

People came and went, walking and stopping, some lingering, some rushing.

Those beside him might leave tomorrow.  
Travelers might return home tomorrow.

 ### Chapter 783: Three out of Four

Lin Junbi never expected that Pang Yuanji was also a big mouth; the news of his departure had already spread among the other sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage.

At dawn, Lin Junbi simply packed his belongings and strolled through the Summer Retreat Palace. He eventually returned to the main hall, glancing at the tables arranged within. For cultivators who were unaware of the changing seasons in the world below, a few short years felt like a fleeting moment. Yet Lin Junbi felt as though he had lived through a grand dream here, and he was somewhat reluctant to wake up from it.

He shook his head to dispel these thoughts, feeling that leaving without saying goodbye might not be such a bad thing after all.

To his surprise, several sword cultivators arrived, all of them mounted on their swords. Aside from the young Hidden Official, everyone was present, including Guo Zhujiu, who had brought a gong and drum along.

Lin Junbi straightened his collar and bowed in thanks to the crowd.

It was customary for friends to drink together when seeing someone off from the Sword Qi Great Wall, so the group headed to the tavern run by the second shopkeeper to drink. Even at this early hour, there were still seats available. Everyone had a small drink, as farewell toasts were generally more subdued, taken in moderation. Lin Junbi requested a plaque from the tavern owner, and as a golden dan sword cultivator, he wrote a phrase: “Lin Junbi has had this drink, and in three years, he shall break through three realms.” He personally hung it on the wall.

The wooden plaque seemed to resonate with the sword cultivators.

Gu Jianlong remarked, “Junbi’s words truly reflect the style of the Hidden Officials. The phrase ‘and only’ is simply exquisite.”

In the end, Lin Junbi raised his drinking bowl and downed its contents, smiling as he said, “It has been a pleasure spending time with all of you in this Orchid and Bamboo Chamber.”

Turning to Guo Zhujiu, he added, “When I return to my hometown, if I venture out again, I must have a bamboo box and a bamboo staff.”

Finally, everyone stood up, clasping their fists in farewell, but they did not accompany Lin Junbi far. Guo Zhujiu, a bit regretful, found that the gong and drum had gone unused.

Thus, the white-clad youth with a small bag slung over his shoulder left the tavern alone and headed towards the great gate leading to Mount Inverted. This entrance, located between the city and the mirage, was much further from the city and considerably more lively. The trade routes involving Chunfan Pavilion and Haoran’s Eight Continents ferry were becoming increasingly smooth. Chen Chunan from South Posa Island, the Yu family from Yujia, Zhou Shenzhi, the master of the Bitter Summer Sword Immortal, Jiang Shangzhen, the newly appointed sect leader of Yuguizong from Tongye Island, and several major sects from North Julu Island, along with many wandering sword immortals who had established connections in their respective continents, evidently contributed, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the worst-case scenario that the young Hidden Official and Chou Miao Sword Immortal were concerned about did not occur. The Central Plains Confucian Temple did not support the new structure created by the Eight Continents ferry, but it had also not explicitly opposed it.

Lin Junbi’s small bag contained only ordinary items: a finely printed manual of the Bi Sword Immortal, a jade bamboo fan purchased from the Yan family shop, and some small gifts from friends like Pang Yuanji. The gifts were light in weight but heavy in sentiment; Lin Junbi felt genuinely happy. Their relationship had not yet reached the point where he needed to be overly polite about gifts; true friends were more casual with one another.

As he proceeded, he remained vigilant. At the gate, Lin Junbi saw the young Hidden Official, who had not concealed his face, standing next to a woman of moderate stature. A natural fragrance of grass and wood surrounded her, indicating she must have employed an illusion technique to conceal her true appearance. Such actions were rare among the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall; sword immortals generally considered them beneath them. However, it was an exception for the Hidden Official, who, when serious, could mask even a woman’s face. According to Gu Jianlong, in battle, the young Hidden Official had disguised himself as a woman to attack, and his figure was surprisingly graceful. Since Guo Zhujiu had heard this, it might as well have been said to the Hidden Official, which was why Gu Jianlong had to limp for a month.

Lin Junbi quickly guessed the woman’s identity: she was the mastermind behind one of the four private estates of Mount Inverted, the Plum Blossom Garden's Lady Toh Yan.

Regarding matters at the borders, Lady Toh Yan had not only escaped unscathed but somehow switched allegiance to Lu Zhi. This renowned figure in Haoran was a top-tier enchantress of the Fifth Realm, who had compensated for her past misdeeds, and after the incident at Plum Blossom Garden, all its assets were confiscated by the Summer Retreat Palace. If one were to speak of beauty as a strategy, it could work on anyone, but it had no effect on the young Hidden Official. As for the complicated backstory of the changes at Plum Blossom Garden, the young Hidden Official did not elaborate, and no one was willing to ask further.

Chen Ping’an mentioned that he was just on his way to Chunfan Pavilion.

Lin Junbi had no objections.

Currently, the Hidden Official was frequently traveling between Mount Inverted and the Sword Qi Great Wall and no longer needed to go out of his way to conceal his identity. Those who should know would pretend not to, and it was better that those who shouldn’t know remain unaware. With the current vigilance of the Sword Qi Great Wall, anyone who knew too much could land in serious trouble. The power of the Hidden Official lineage was immense; sword strikes could kill without a need for explanation or justification. Even the wealthy mansions on Taixiang Street and Yuhuo Street could be targeted if they attracted suspicion from the Summer Retreat Palace, and the lineage’s sword cultivators could act as if they were in an uninhabited realm.

In the past two years, following numerous intelligence reports that only the Hidden Official had access to, many operations had been carried out, with Lin Junbi personally participating in two encirclements aimed at the “merchants” over in the Mirage. They had been executed flawlessly, like cutting through melons and vegetables. One incident involved a highly respected old Yuanying who had been operating in the Mirage for many years, disguised so well and with excellent connections that the Hidden Official lineage did not wish to elaborate on the reasons. The situation nearly escalated into chaos in the Mirage. Ultimately, six sword immortals, including Gao Kui, flew into the air on their swords, while the young Hidden Official remained silent, standing outside with his hands tucked in his sleeves. Only when Chou Miao dragged the body out did he turn to leave. That day, twenty-three shops in the Mirage closed down, and the Sword Qi Great Wall did not intervene, allowing them to relocate to Mount Inverted. However, the next day, all the shops had new owners.

Sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, from Chou Miao to Dong Buduo, and even Guo Zhujiu, still a young girl, were all swift and decisive in their actions.

However, many of the more sordid matters could not simply be resolved by drawing swords. Lin Junbi remembered the young Hidden Official spending ten days at the sword workshop, and upon returning to the Summer Retreat Palace, he remarkably did not confide in the sword cultivators about the events that had transpired, only stating that he had resolved a significant hidden danger.

Sometimes, Lin Junbi would indulge in whimsical thoughts: if our Hidden Official lineage and this Summer Retreat Palace were to establish themselves as a sect in the Haoran world, what would it be like?

The young Hidden Official would be the mountain lord, Chou Miao Sword Immortal would oversee the laws, the sword immortal Mi Yu would be in charge of the genealogy, Wei Wenlong would handle finances, while the other sword cultivators would practice diligently, each managing their own peak and lineage, branching out as they pleased and accepting disciples.

It would surely be magnificent. Within a century at most, the entire Haoran world would have to pay attention. Unfortunately, that was merely Lin Junbi’s daydream.

Lady Toh Yan remained silent, glancing at the youth several times. This “border” had been mentioned by her respected senior, who held this junior disciple in high regard.

Upon arriving at Mount Inverted, Lin Junbi followed his master's secret instructions to visit an old friend of a certain gentleman at the Yuan Ruo Mansion, and then that night, he would take a cross-continental ferry back to the Central Divine Continent.

At the entrance of the Yuan Ruo Mansion, Chen Ping’an took out a wooden box from his belongings and said, “This contains some relics of old friends who have visited the tavern. Treasure it well; you might find it useful in the future. I only hope that you can honor the relics inside and not let me down by sending them to the wrong person.”

Lin Junbi accepted the wooden box with both hands, guessing that it contained the plaques taken down from the walls of the tavern. This farewell gift was immensely significant.

As long as Lin Junbi had the heart, as soon as he returned to the Central Divine Continent, he could immediately convert it into cherished connections, public reputation, and even tangible benefits.

With a serious tone, Lin Junbi said, “Rest assured, Hidden Official; I will be more prudent in my actions from now on.”

Chen Ping’an replied softly, “One thing at a time, focus on the matter, not the person. Once you return to the Shao Yuan Dynasty, I hope you can balance your studies and cultivation. Once you mingle with the masses, it’s easy for the pure to become muddied. Junbi, you must think carefully.”

Lin Junbi took a step back and bowed, “I bid farewell to the Hidden Official.”

Chen Ping’an returned the gesture.

Chen Ping’an and Lady Toh Yan headed to Chunfan Pavilion, while Lin Junbi watched their retreating figures and suddenly called out, “A gentleman loves wealth, but takes it through righteous means. I have never seen Mr. Chen conduct business so straightforwardly.”

Chen Ping’an did not turn around but waved his hand.

Lin Junbi watched as the two departed.

As they neared Chunfan Pavilion, Lady Toh Yan smiled charmingly, speaking to the young Hidden Official with her heart’s voice, “Lin Junbi has left. What about the other foreign sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage? Will they also be fleeing?”

Chen Ping’an replied with a grin, “Fleeing?”

Lady Toh Yan turned to the young Hidden Official, her face full of apology, yet she spoke with an unrepentant tone, “Perhaps my wording was inaccurate; that’s the essence of it. Anyone who leaves the Sword Qi Great Wall alive is technically fleeing, right? Of course, Mr. Lu is an exception.”

Referring to a woman as “Mr.” in the Haoran world is a significant form of respect.

Chen Ping’an said, “Lady Toh Yan, if even the entire Plum Blossom Garden can run away, how can you accuse the foreign sword cultivators of our Hidden Official lineage?”

Lady Toh Yan switched her tone, “To be honest, I truly admire the means and spirit of these young people. Once they return to the Haoran world, they will surely become formidable figures, outstanding heroes. I make such comments out of envy; they are sword cultivators, with great potential ahead, making it hard not to feel a twinge of jealousy with every glance.”

Upon entering Chunfan Pavilion, Chen Ping’an asked, “Do you know why I wanted you to visit Mount Inverted?”

Lady Toh Yan, with a melancholic look, bit her lip and said, “How could I possibly guess? The Hidden Official’s position is so high that whatever you say goes.”

Chen Ping’an stated bluntly, “Find a time when there are fewer people, and move the entire Plum Blossom Garden to the Sword Qi Great Wall. It will be beneficial, and the Summer Retreat Palace will remember your contribution.”

Lady Toh Yan complained, “Hidden Official, you even want to take away an empty Plum Blossom Garden? Isn’t that a bit much? Can’t you leave me with a memory? When I arrive at South Posa Island, I should at least be able to contribute a little to ensure Mr. Lu has a peaceful place to cultivate, right?”

Chen Ping’an said, “Whether or not you have that conspicuous Plum Blossom Garden, with Lu Zhi’s temperament, he would actively help you sever past grudges, allowing you to cultivate in peace. So, you don’t need to complicate matters. As long as you can reach the Celestial realm, you will have the means to protect yourself in the Haoran world. Even if Lu Zhi is not around, no one will dare to underestimate Lady Toh Yan, and other academies will treat you with respect.”

Lady Toh Yan lamented, “There are no more romantic nights, just the mundane struggles of life. I am but a pitiful traveler in this world.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “A self-aware person does not blame others.”

Lady Toh Yan gave him a sidelong glance, her charm radiating, “Mr. Chen, you become quite unromantic when you speak of reason.”

Chen Ping’an frowned, “Are we that familiar?”

Lady Toh Yan pretended to be pitiful, “Isn’t Mrs. Xie from the tavern familiar with Mr. Chen?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, realizing he had been thoroughly tricked by Ah Liang and Mrs. Xie.

Lady Toh Yan composed herself, her curiosity piqued. “I’ve only heard that Mrs. Xie was once a Yuanying sword cultivator, but later her path was interrupted; her flying sword broke, her sword heart shattered. Why does she look at you with such new eyes? There must be a story there, right? If Mr. Chen is willing to share, I will gladly assist with moving the Plum Blossom Garden.”

Chen Ping’an feigned ignorance, never having encountered such a boring enchantress from the Fifth Realm.

In another room, Wei Wenlong and the others—Shao Yunyan, Mi Yu, Yan Ming, and Nalan Caihuan—were discussing business matters with a group of ferry managers in the meeting hall.

In the adjacent room, several of Shao Yunyan’s disciples were assisting with accounting.

Lady Toh Yan dropped her illusion, adopting a languid posture as she leaned against the doorframe. With her bare face devoid of makeup, she naturally exuded a rustic charm.

Unfortunately, Wei Wenlong glanced at her but quickly turned away, his heart unmoved. Though the woman was beautiful, she couldn’t compare to the allure of the accounting books.

After Chen Ping’an took a seat, he randomly picked up a book from the towering pile of accounts, flipping through it while inquiring about the recent trade conditions from Wei Wenlong.

Lady Toh Yan, with nothing to do and unable to casually sit and flip through the accounts, sat on the threshold, her back to the room, leaning forward with her hands propping up her chin.

Once Wei Wenlong finished answering the young Hidden Official’s questions, he inadvertently glanced at Lady Toh Yan’s back, and found it hard to pull his gaze away.

Beyond the accounts lay different scenery.

Chen Ping’an noticed Wei Wenlong’s unusual behavior but chose not to interrupt his moment of admiration.

After all, Wei Wenlong was a single man; a few glances wouldn’t hurt. Perhaps after some time, he might even come to his senses.

Yet after only two pages of accounts, Wei Wenlong seemed to regain his composure, as if he found the accounts on the table more interesting.

Mi Yu returned from the meeting hall, cursing and swearing angrily at the ferry managers who had been blinded by greed. Unexpectedly, upon seeing Lady Toh Yan, he instantly became lively and spirited.

To his surprise, Lady Toh Yan had already risen, keeping him at a distance and not giving Mi Yu the chance to get close. She turned to Chen Ping’an and said, “If the Hidden Official trusts me, I will handle the relocation of the Plum Blossom Garden myself.”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

Lady Toh Yan flashed away.

Mi Yu stood at the door, lightly waving his hand to create a breeze, and smiled at Wei Wenlong, “You dimwit, have you had enough of looking? If I were you, I would have sincerely asked Lady Toh Yan if she needed my hands as a little stool.”

Wei Wenlong had no words to respond.

Chen Ping’an stood up and strolled with Mi Yu through Chunfan Pavilion. Today, two groups of merchants were scheduled to visit, and Chen Ping’an planned to listen in on the second meeting, waiting for the first group of ferry managers to leave before heading to the meeting hall.

Mi Yu remarked unexpectedly, “That Lady Toh Yan from the Plum Blossom Garden is also a woman of misfortune. Thus, when she sees someone like me, she finds it most repugnant.”

Chen Ping’an did not bring up the Sword Nurturing Gourd, and since the affairs of the Mi brothers were their own, he saw no need to interfere with Mi Yu’s decision.

Suddenly, Mi Yu said, “I’ve always been hesitant to return to the Sword Qi Great Wall because I didn’t know what to say.”

Chen Ping’an realized that this Yuanying sword cultivator, infamous in the Sword Qi Great Wall, had already understood his elder brother Mi Hu’s intentions.

After a moment of silence, Mi Yu said, “But I must go back; I can’t keep avoiding it.”

Chen Ping’an then took out the Sword Nurturing Gourd and handed it to Mi Yu.

Mi Yu merely glanced at it and shook his head, “This was given to you by my brother. What does it mean for me? Hidden Official, you should keep it. My brother would feel more at ease. Besides, I no longer need the Sword Nurturing Gourd to nurture my life sword.”

Previously, as a sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage, Mi Yu had fought alongside other sword cultivators several times. While he had fought with all his might, he had never truly forgotten the weight of life and death. The reason was simple: once he found himself in a desperate situation, the first to die would be his brother.

Chen Ping’an kicked Mi Yu lightly, “Then go ahead and make haste.”

Mi Yu left Chunfan Pavilion.

After the first group of ferry managers left the meeting hall, Shao Yunyan and the others needed to see them off. Only then did Chen Ping’an enter the empty main hall.

When Shao Yunyan, Yan Ming, and Nalan Caihuan returned, Chen Ping’an chose not to sit in the main seat but instead sat in Mi Yu’s position, closer to Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan.

Shao Yunyan casually took a seat across from him.

Nalan Caihuan reported in detail on the trade developments regarding the Eight Continents ferry. The matter concerning the Divine Money from the Ai Ai Continent was still the most challenging, as the Liu family had yet to make a clear statement. When Nalan Caihuan mentioned this, she appeared worried and then somewhat frustrated, saying, “Why don’t we just seize the Yuan Ruo Mansion? What if it’s not something like the Plum Blossom Garden or Chunfan Pavilion? We can dismantle it. Those pavilions and towers, all made of divine money! After all, the Liu family hasn’t considered moving; with people gone and buildings left empty, it’s practically unowned. At worst, we can have the Nanji ferry send a private message to the Liu family, saying we owe them a favor, and later have sword immortals like Xie Songhua help to repay it.”

Shao Yunyan could only smile wryly at such a fanciful idea.

“Just one thing, can any of us persuade sword immortal Xie Songhua?” 

Unexpectedly, Chen Ping’an interjected, “No rush; dismantling is inevitable. The Liu family from the Ai Ai Continent is likely waiting for us to dismantle the Yuan Ruo Mansion. They’re just sitting at home, waiting for us to deliver this favor. However, friends are friends, and business is business. We need to consider what we’ll offer in return for the help of sword immortals, including Xie Songhua. You three should work together on this; by the time we reach an agreement, we won’t need to consult the Summer Retreat Palace anymore—just give a direct response.”

Yan Ming asked, “Does the purchase of the Cloud-Drifting Pavilion by Li Cai from Floating Duck Lake mean we can establish an additional ferry route? Connect with the Yuguizong of Tongye Island? Tongye Island is rich in resources, and if we can have the ferries from Old Dragon City fully operate towards Mount Inverted, we might even increase our resources by twenty percent.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “It can only stop here. Jiang Shangzhen sent those divine coins in his capacity as the head of the Jiang family, which in itself is a statement.”

Although Jiang Shangzhen was now the newly appointed head of Yuguizong, the newly ascended Xuanyuan from Tongye Island would never agree to this move, and Jiang Shangzhen wouldn’t be foolish enough to act recklessly.

If Jiang Shangzhen dared to prioritize personal matters over public good, he might soon lose his position as sect leader. Xuanyuan would be capable of making such a decision, and the Jiang family might even be replaced, with the Yunkong Blessed Land changing masters.

To act upon one’s position and seek benefits for oneself is an undeniable principle for all genealogical immortal masters.

Mountain and wild cultivators have their own advantages and disadvantages, while genealogical immortal masters have their own gains and losses.

Suddenly, Lady Toh Yan appeared outside the door, holding a potted plant. Inside the pot were miniature pavilions and lush trees, each detail vividly rendered.

This small potted plant was essentially the entire Plum Blossom Garden. The contrast with Chen Ping’an’s impression of moving an entire estate was immense.

Perhaps this was what they called a pure and serene place, a small mountain in the palm of one’s hand.

Standing at the entrance, Lady Toh Yan lightly tossed the potted plant to the young Hidden Official and playfully asked, “Is this related to Mr. Shou?”

Shao Yunyan and the others were utterly confused.

Chen Ping’an accepted the potted plant within his reach and said, “Honestly, I’m not sure. You can ask Lu Zhi.”

After the gracefully departing Lady Toh Yan left, Shao Yunyan remarked, “With this, it seems the four private estates of Mount Inverted only have the Water Crystal Palace of the Rain Dragon Sect left unclaimed by us.”

Yan Ming’s expression was indifferent as he casually said, “Since you enjoy watching the spectacle and making sarcastic remarks, then enjoy it to your heart's content.”

Nalan Caihuan looked towards the entrance, recalling the expressions of the Rain Dragon Sect cultivators and sneering, “So many innocent cultivators, and we won’t help them? If we don’t intervene, we’ll definitely be criticized; it’s unbecoming of a sword cultivator, unworthy of a sword immortal. If the Hidden Official doesn’t intervene, I’ll go to the Water Crystal Palace and earnestly persuade them to relocate their sect elsewhere for a more peaceful existence. A little financial loss is far better than losing one’s life.”

Chen Ping’an refrained from getting involved.

When Shao Yunyan stood up to receive the second wave of ferry managers, Nalan Caihuan noticed that the young Hidden Official had already vanished.

Even though she knew he was nearby, as a Yuanying sword cultivator, Nalan Caihuan did not perceive his presence, failing to detect even a ripple of his aura.

After that, a meeting dragged on for an hour and a half, largely consisting of both sides bickering.

Shao Yunyan took the role of the harsh critic, Nalan Caihuan being the villain, while Yan Ming leaned towards one side.

In fact, Chen Ping’an had been quietly standing behind Mi Yu’s chair, watching the back-and-forth negotiations unfold.

The smaller the space of the cage, the stricter the rules within it.

When Chen Ping’an condensed the divine powers of this life sword into a small space, even a Yuanying sword cultivator like Nalan Caihuan remained oblivious.

Against the troublesome foes outside of the four major obstacles, for any cultivator below the Fifth Realm, utilizing pine needles, thunderous coughs, or spirit runes combined with physical strength, one could control the wind and the sword, instantly bridging the distance, and display the cage bird technique, closing in, face to face, delivering a punch to conclude it all.

One ferry manager who had not participated in the first meeting at Chunfan Pavilion grew agitated during the arguments. He slammed his palm on the table, causing the teacups to jump, and angrily shouted, “How can you conduct business like this? The price-cutting is utterly heartless! Even if the Hidden Official were sitting here facing us, I would still say this: the goods on my ferry, buy them if you want. If Chunfan Pavilion keeps cutting prices, it’s like killing me! I’m not afraid of you sword immortals; no way! At most, I’ll just stab myself first and take a break here, so that both Chunfan Pavilion and my sect have a proper explanation…”

Yan Ming leaned back slightly in his chair, his back against the seat. In reality, the deal could still be negotiated; according to the price offered by Chunfan Pavilion, the other party would still make a good profit. This was just pure nonsense on their part; the joy of trading lay in this.

Yan Ming didn’t hate the interaction; after all, it was business. However, the same old cunning foxes kept coming in waves, and it was tiring.

Nalan Caihuan wore an amused smile.

Then, dozens of ferry managers all turned toward a certain spot, where a tall figure appeared out of thin air.

Everyone instantly rose to their feet.

Across from them stood a young man with his hands clasped over the top of the chair, smiling, “One knife isn’t enough; I have two. After I’m done, remember to return them.”

Though Nalan Caihuan had harbored great resentment toward the young Hidden Official, she couldn’t help but admit that sometimes, Chen Ping’an’s words did refresh the spirit.

A ferry manager who had crossed paths with the young Hidden Official bowed respectfully, introducing himself, “I pay my respects to the Hidden Official!”

The manager who had been shouting about stabbing himself seemed struck by lightning, left speechless.

Chen Ping’an did not actually put the ferry manager in a difficult position but instead, actively offered a concession before leaving the hall.

This time, after exiting Chunfan Pavilion and returning to the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping’an did not take the usual longer route but instead walked through the original grand entrance.

Once again, that young disciple sitting on the meditation mat reading did not lift his head upon seeing Chen Ping’an.

The sword-wielding man on the other side of the door did not show himself, and Chen Ping’an did not greet the familiar sword immortal named Zhang Lu.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 784: Today, Tomorrow, the Day After Tomorrow

Chen Ping'an found Ah Liang at the corner tavern. 

Ah Liang was currently leaning against a swordsman, joking, "What are you sad about? Even if Nalan Caihuan has won your heart, can she claim your body? Not a chance; Nalan Caihuan doesn’t have that kind of ability." The swordsman didn’t feel any better; instead, he wanted to drink even more. He swayed a bit, reached for the wine jug on the table, only to find it empty. Ah Liang quickly ordered another jug of wine. Just then, a series of hisses sounded as Madam Xie twisted her waist and wound her way out from behind the counter, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she smiled at the street outside. Upon hearing the commotion, Ah Liang turned around and saw Chen Ping'an had arrived. "At the Sword Qi Great Wall, it seems that us scholars are quite precious; we are welcomed wherever we go."

After Chen Ping'an took a seat, he smiled and said, "Ah Liang, I'm inviting you to dinner at Ning Mansion. I'll cook myself."

Madam Xie placed a jug of wine on the table but didn’t sit down. Ah Liang nodded in acceptance of Chen Ping'an's invitation. At this moment, he tilted his head to look at the woman, his eyes blurry from the effects of the wine. "Sister Xie, what’s going on? I can barely see your face."

Madam Xie scoffed, "Are you going to ramble on again about how every time you get drunk, you can see two upside-down mountains? You’re not being original, Ah Liang; you’re getting old. You should read more of the Bi Jian Xian's Imprint Compendium; that’s the kind of conversation a scholar should be having."

Ah Liang felt a pang of sadness at her disdain for novelty.

After the two left, Chen Ping'an walked a little distance before saying, "I read in the archives at the Summer Palace that Xie Yuan was gravely injured, and ever since, this Madam Xie has been selling wine to make a living."

Ah Liang shook off the haze of alcohol and slapped his cheeks. "It’s not right to call her 'Madam Xie' since she has never married. Xie Yuan is from Yangliu Lane, incredibly talented in swordsmanship, and stood out at a young age, younger than Yue Qing and Mi Hu, and is on the same level as Nalan Caihuan. Plus, she’s the one that Cheng Quan and Zhao Gezi have been thinking about; she was one of the most outstanding young women at the Sword Qi Great Wall back in the day."

Ah Liang sighed, "In the drizzling rain, as the world turns hazy, a handsome scholar sees a woman holding an umbrella, her azure robe fluttering like flowers blooming on the roadside, resembling a willow swaying in the spring rain—absolutely breathtaking."

Chen Ping'an replied, "Remove ‘handsome scholar,’ and just picture the woman alone; that scene would indeed be beautiful."

Ah Liang laughed, "Without that handsome scholar's perspective, how would you even know such beauty exists?"

He continued, "Xie Yuan exchanged her life-bound flying sword with a junior sister of the sword immortal Shou Chen on the battlefield, both of them shattered their swords, and she was gravely injured. Unable to escape in time, Shou Chen caught up and struck her again. If she hadn’t suffered that calamity, Xie Yuan would have easily reached the upper five realms. So, with Xie Yuan’s connection to the Wenhai lineage, it's no surprise there’s a deep-seated grudge; she naturally feels grateful to you for beating that Jia Shen account nearly to death."

Ah Liang chuckled maliciously, "In such matters, a simple thank you when they meet is sufficient; no need to make a fuss about it."

Now it dawned on Chen Ping'an why Ah Liang had invited him for a drink at the tavern—it was to help Xie Yuan untangle a knot in her heart, and of course, Ah Liang was enjoying a free drink himself.

When they reached Ning Mansion, Chen Ping'an indeed went to the kitchen to cook, with Granny Bai helping out as they chatted about trivial matters.

In the guest room of Chen Ping'an's residence, Ah Liang rummaged through the famous Bi Jian Xian's Imprint Compendium, with several blank fan surfaces and ordinary materials spread across the table. However, it seemed he wouldn’t be putting pen to paper anytime soon.

Ning Yao sat nearby and asked, "What’s the deal with the outer heaven demons of the Outer Sky? Is it true that even the White Jade Capital can’t completely suppress them?"

The origins of the outer heaven demons remained an ambiguous topic in the vast realm. As for the sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall, they hardly cared.

Ah Liang only provided a rough overview, "Isn’t it the case that troubles are brought upon us by us cultivators ourselves? We can’t clean up our own mess and choose to deceive ourselves instead, letting it go on unchecked. Year after year, as floods ravage the land, the Qingming realm can only resort to the most primitive methods of building dikes to block the water, raising them higher and higher over time. Eventually, it becomes a perilous scene of 'floodwaters hanging overhead.' We can’t blame the White Jade Capital for merely treating symptoms and not the root cause; every Qi practitioner bears some responsibility. It is said that the second Daoist’s senior brother is dedicated to seeking fundamental solutions. Both the second Daoist and Lu Chen have their own strategies, but one is too deliberate and harsh, while the other is too casual; I suspect the Dao Ancestor is not fond of either, and more hope rests on the eldest disciple."

The three heads of White Jade Capital are akin to the three teaching ancestors under the Dao Ancestor in the Qingming realm, but the title of teaching ancestor is self-bestowed by the Daoists, and the various schools of thought do not acknowledge it.

Ah Liang smiled, "Don’t blame me for being vague; it’s not my intention to keep secrets from you. The truth is, one often speaks unconsciously, while the listener takes it to heart. When cultivators get earnest, it often becomes a great obstacle, especially with these outer heaven demons—talented individuals find it hard to deal with them. Of course, there are exceptions, and you, Ning Yao, are one such case. But once I tell you, it may not be appropriate; it’s better to let things unfold naturally."

Ning Yao nodded.

The reason she inquired about the outer heaven demons was that she worried about Chen Ping'an's future in achieving the Golden Core and Nascent Soul.

As for herself, it seemed she had no concerns at all. Reaching the Golden Core and Nascent Soul—she was merely a step away from the Jade Purity realm. For Ning Yao, breaking through would be easy whenever she decided to.

Ah Liang further disclosed a bit of insight, "The Daoists of the Qingming realm are bustling and busy, not at all relaxed. It’s a different battlefield from the Sword Qi Great Wall, but the level of brutality is comparable. The Western Buddhist Kingdom is similar; beneath the Nine Springs, resentful souls and vengeful spirits gather like the sea. Who are you going to blame?"

Ning Yao asked, "People?"

Ah Liang replied, "Life is a source of worry from the moment one learns to read. So when a person cultivates, naturally, they worry even more, facing more hidden dangers."

Ning Yao queried, "Ah Liang, you should discuss these things with Chen Ping'an; he can keep up with the conversation."

Ah Liang chuckled, "I won’t add to his burdens. You, Ning Yao, can forget what you've heard, which is why it’s right to talk to you."

Ah Liang was twisting a plain, jade-like stone with no inscriptions, slowly saying, "In the end, cultivation is ultimately suppressed by the heavens and the great Dao. Plus, on the path of cultivation, one gets used to only taking and not giving, leading to endless troubles. The sages of old climbed mountains to cultivate, quenching their thirst with poison—they had no choice. We juniors are merely greedy for cups of wine, but our thoughts and ideas have changed; the ancient and modern individuals are two entirely different people. That’s why there’s a saying: those of old externalized without internalizing, while today’s people internalize without externalizing. This is a truth that the elders could no longer suppress, voicing their heartfelt words in frustration. However, deep down, the elders actually hope that the younger generation can prove them wrong."

Ah Liang put away the stone, returning it to its place, and cheerfully declared, "No matter what, we must recognize the characters, read the books, cultivate the Dao, walk the path, and most importantly, eat!"

Ning Yao said, "Just don’t encourage Chen Ping'an to drink."

Ah Liang stood, saying, "A little sip is fine; I promise not to overdo it, but I must drink. A tavern keeper who doesn’t drink is definitely a black-hearted one; I must help the second tavern keeper prove his innocence."

Today at Ning Mansion, the four of them gathered around a table for a meal, all home-cooked dishes.

Chen Ping'an could only have a bowl of wine.

Ah Liang made himself at home, sitting at the main position, and asked with a grin, "Your senior brother hasn’t visited Ning Mansion yet?"

Chen Ping'an sighed, "I mentioned it. My senior brother said since the teacher has never visited Ning Mansion, what kind of student would I be to go there first and act all high and mighty? After some back-and-forth, during that sword practice on the city wall, my senior brother used quite a bit of force; he must have been blaming me for not knowing better."

Ah Liang took a sip of wine and shook his head, "You’re being foolish; you don’t know to talk to the right people. In the end, will you give up the main seat for the old scholar? The old scholar is like he has already taken a seat; how can this student not accompany him? Even if the teacher isn’t physically present, he’s always in the heart."

Chen Ping'an found some wisdom in that and felt a deep sense of regret. With his senior brother's temperament, he believed invoking the teacher’s name would work, regardless of whether the teacher was there or not.

Ah Liang was indeed an old hand at this; he was still far behind in terms of experience.

Granny Bai complained, "Your son-in-law is an honest man, not as scheming as you, Ah Liang."

Ah Liang quickly raised his wine bowl, "Miss Bai, I’ll take a self-punishment; you drink a bowl with your brother Ah Liang."

Bai Lianshuang shot a glare at Ah Liang, ignoring him as she helped Ning Yao and Chen Ping'an pick up some dishes.

She, an old woman, being called ‘Miss’ in front of the young lady and son-in-law—does that make sense?

Ah Liang looked at the white-haired elder and couldn’t help but feel a bit melancholic. He remembered when he first met Bai Lianshuang; she was still a tall and graceful girl, a pure warrior woman, after all, not comparable to a female Qi practitioner—she was at a disadvantage.

Among the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was hard to discern a woman’s true age based solely on her appearance.

When Nalan Yexing, the steward of Ning Mansion, first saw the young Bai Lianshuang, her appearance did not seem aged; she looked like a man in his early forties. Yet later, Bai Lianshuang transitioned from a girl to a young woman, then to one with white hair, while Nalan Yexing fell from the Immortal Realm to the Jade Purity realm, making him look considerably older. In his prime, Nalan Yexing, as Ah Liang would say, had some charm; in the Qingming realm, he was quite the sought-after catch!

And the once extremely beautiful Bai Lianshuang, though she came from the Yao family as a maid, had no trouble finding a husband among the many sword cultivators, where male warriors were rare at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

However, Bai Lianshuang had high standards, excellent martial arts talent, and did not settle for any sword immortal, so year after year, the young girl grew into an old maid, and the old maid inadvertently became an old woman.

Ah Liang chuckled, "Miss Bai, you might not know, but Nalan Yexing’s grandfather, Jiang Yun, nicknamed Stone, is about the same age as you. There are several other old drunks who are still single. In their youth, they wouldn’t dare say a word to you, but when they met secretly later, they would all curse each other for being shameless. Jiang Yun especially loved to mock Nalan Yexing for being unashamed, saying how old he was, and yet he still acted like a senior. Nalan Yexing’s skills in cursing are truly pathetic, but luckily he’s good at fighting; I once saw him sneak into Jiang’s house at midnight while Jiang Yun was asleep, and hit him with a blunt weapon. After one hit to knock him out, he followed up with several strikes to the face, all in one go. The weapon didn’t break, and the man didn’t leave. Each time Jiang Yun woke up, he never understood how he ended up with a bruised face. In the end, he even bought several talismans from me to ward off evil spirits."

The old woman merely smiled at this, but her peripheral vision caught sight of an empty spot near the entrance.

Ning Yao felt a little anxious and glanced at Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an gently shook his head, signaling her not to worry.

Some words were better left to the family elder, while Chen Ping'an, being a junior, didn’t want to speak out of turn.

Ah Liang was the right person to say them.

Ah Liang and Bai Lianshuang reminisced about the past.

Granny Bai hardly spoke, just listening.

There were many people and events related to her that she still didn’t understand because she had never paid attention in the past, perhaps more so because she was deeply entrenched in this mountain.

Chen Ping'an noticed Ning Yao paying close attention, which made him feel helpless.

Ah Liang suddenly asked, "Chen Ping'an, in your hometown, don’t you have any female peers you care about or who like you?"

Without hesitation, Chen Ping'an replied, "No. They were too young and didn’t understand these things. Besides, I went to the Dragon Kiln to become an apprentice at a young age. According to the old customs in my hometown, girls weren’t allowed near the kiln."

Ah Liang countered, "That’s not right. I heard from Li Huai that there’s a family next door to you in Mud Bottle Lane, and there’s a little girl there who is quite cute. That’s what they call a childhood sweetheart; how could the relationship be bad? Li Huai said you got up early every day just to help fetch water, and he even said your family had a wall that was dug out with a pit, as if you were just one window away from opening a door."

"Every day, you and your grandpa," Chen Ping'an thought to himself, but he said, "Liu Xianyang likes her; I don’t. Besides, when Li Huai saw you, Ah Liang, he hadn’t even been to Mud Bottle Lane. His family fetches water from far away, never going to the Iron Lock Well. My wall has one side next to an empty house, and the other side is next to Song Jixin's place. Li Huai is just talking nonsense; anyone who believes him is a fool."

Ning Yao chimed in, "I’ve seen her; she’s quite pretty. She’s just not very tall, and if she doesn’t stand on her toes while peeking over the wall into Chen Ping'an's courtyard, I can only see half her head."

Ah Liang rubbed his chin, clearly wanting to continue the conversation, but Chen Ping'an raised his wine bowl and downed it in one go, saying, "After finishing this wine, I’ll eat."

At this meal, it was mostly Ah Liang boasting about his past exploits in the jianghu, recounting interesting encounters with mountain gods and water spirits, along with some eerie encounters with ghosts and spirits. He told of a ghostly scholar who "gained weight by eating characters," claiming that if one consumed books, their cultivation would increase. He also recounted a stroke of luck, where he accidentally attended a banquet called the Hundred Flowers Feast in the mountains and met a little girl crying in a corner. It turned out she was a banana spirit, lamenting that poets rarely wrote about bananas, which hindered her cultivation level, leaving her unloved by her peers. Ah Liang was indignant and joined her in cursing the scholars, then spontaneously wrote several poems on leaves to give her, but she didn’t accept a single leaf or poem and ran away, crying even harder. Ah Liang even mentioned how he once watched a few skeletons in a graveyard and recognized one of the spirits, which no one believed.

He spoke of seeing a woman known for her icy demeanor in the mountains, twirling her skirt when she thought no one was around, and how he encountered a group of gossiping female ghosts in the overgrown wilderness, which scared him half to death. He also recalled a lonely little girl he met at a dilapidated grave, who, in a daze upon seeing him, screamed "a ghost!" and ran around erratically, unable to leave the area around the grave. Ah Liang had to explain that he was a good ghost who meant no harm. Eventually, the little girl, regaining her senses, felt sorry for him and asked how long it had been since he last saw the sun. Before parting, Ah Liang helped the girl settle in a small nest, a cozy place that could shield her from wind and gather water, allowing her to see the daylight.

As he continued to talk, the spirited man gradually grew somber, taking a big gulp of wine. "Later, when I passed by again, I wanted to check on the little girl and see if she had grown up. But I didn’t find her. It turned out that a passing immortal, without asking for any reason, had casually killed her. I remember when the little girl happily bid me farewell, she said, 'Haha, we are ghosts; now I’ll never be afraid of ghosts again.'"

Ah Liang picked up a peanut, chewing it slowly, "If only I had thought a bit more, even just a little, like not treating a small ghost with such indifference, why must I have taken her to a certain mountain spirit to settle? Moving her home, getting some incense to burn, and achieving a bit of stability, would it also make her less happy? I pondered in places where I shouldn’t have, but I didn’t think enough about the cultivators on the mountain who focused solely on their paths and never overthought it. In this world, there’s always the potential for the unexpected, and yet I didn’t think enough."

Ah Liang murmured, "Years have gone by, yet I still want to know, as this little girl with no one to rely on leaves this world, will she still remember that swordsman and want to say something to him? If she does, what would she say? I’ll never know."

Ah Liang turned to Chen Ping'an, "What I’ve been saying, the nonsense you ignore, and you didn’t heed my advice—good, that’s the Chen Ping'an I know, regarding everything as a grand matter. You wouldn't see Ah Liang as a sword immortal; why should you cling to such trivial past events at the dining table?"

Ah Liang raised his wine bowl and drank it all by himself.

The parting of the strong feels magnificent, while the farewells of the weak are silent and indistinct, with no clear sound of weeping.

Ning Yao and Granny Bai left the table first, saying they wanted to go sit at the Dragon Slaying Cliff Pavilion together. Ning Yao asked Chen Ping'an to keep Ah Liang company for a bit longer, and Chen Ping'an said he would tidy up the dishes afterward.

After the two finished their drinks, Chen Ping'an walked Ah Liang to the door.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an remembered that Ah Liang seemed to never have a proper place to settle down at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

He only knew that after every drinking session, Ah Liang would sway on his sword, casually living in the abandoned residences left by the sword immortals outside the city. 

On the city wall, he could lie down and sleep without a care.

Ah Liang said, "In the next six months, you won’t be able to engage in combat in the city anyway, so you should plan well for yourself—nurture your sword, practice your fist, refine your materials; you have plenty to keep yourself busy. Over at the Summer Palace, there’s Chou Miao holding down the fort; even if a few young outsiders leave, those from the Hidden Official lineage can fill in the gaps and continue their duties. The Spring Banner Studio still has Yan Ming and the others, so neither side will falter. Here’s my suggestion: you can visit the old deaf man’s prison more often; whether you have business or not, personally experiencing the pressure from the great demons of the Immortal Realm would be beneficial. It’s a pity that the ascended being was beheaded; otherwise, the effect would have been even better. I’ll give the old deaf man a heads-up and keep an eye on things for you; there won’t be any surprises. Your life-bound divine ability from the caged sparrow and the bottleneck of the seventh realm martial artist can all be polished in this time."

Chen Ping'an hesitated to respond.

Ah Liang said, "There’s no need to delay any longer; it’s only six months, enough time for the old sword immortal to arrange a retreat."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Ah Liang smiled, "For these six months, I’ll be here with you."

Ah Liang suddenly remarked, "The old sword immortal is a kind person, proficient in swordsmanship, good character, with a kind face, thick brows, broad shoulders—quite the handsome figure…"

Chen Ping'an was left bewildered, not understanding why Ah Liang's flattery felt so forced. Then, Chen Ping'an found himself atop the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Near the thatched cottage, he was surrounded either by the old sword immortals or the great sword immortals.

The mischievous Yuan Zao Hua once listed the top ten sword immortals in the minds of these children.

The old sword immortal, Dong San Geng, Ah Liang, the Hidden Official, Chen Xi, Qi Ting Ji, Zuo You, Nalan Shao Wei, the old deaf man, and Lu Zhi.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an's senior brother, Zuo You, was already in Tongye Continent, replaced by Ah Liang returning to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As for the Hidden Official, he remained, but had swapped identities with Chen Ping'an.

For some unknown reason today, all ten individuals needed to gather at the city wall.

The old sword immortal Chen Xi smiled slightly at the young Hidden Official, and Chen Ping'an returned the gesture with a clasped fist.

Chen Qingdu, hands behind his back, asked with a smile, "Hidden Official, it seems you are the only one here who isn’t a sword immortal."

Chen Ping'an nodded helplessly.

Nalan Shao Wei cast a sidelong glance, chuckling.

Chen Ping'an chose to ignore him, hearing nothing.

Ah Liang and the old deaf man were chummy, whispering to each other, while the old deaf man nodded vigorously at the young Hidden Official.

Chen Qingdu said, "Once everything is discussed, everyone may disperse."

Most of the sword immortals used their swords to return.

Even Ah Liang didn’t say much and walked away with the old deaf man.

Chen Ping'an was left in a daze. What was going on?

Chen Qingdu waved his hand, saying, "Bringing you here was just to make up the numbers."

Chen Ping'an tentatively asked, "Old sword immortal, is there really nothing for me to do?"

Chen Qingdu shook his head with a sympathetic look.

Chen Ping'an could only summon his talisman boat, puzzled, and return to the city.

Earlier, on the north city wall, he had seen Fengxue Temple Sword Immortal practicing swordplay and greeted him, mentioning that Wei the Great Sword Immortal was basking in the sun.

Wei Jin smiled, his gaze mirroring that of the old sword immortal’s—filled with sympathy—as he looked at the departing talisman boat, seeming a bit foolish and naive.

Upon returning to Ning Mansion, he found only Granny Bai at the pavilion and could not see Ning Yao. The old woman simply smiled and said she didn’t know where the young lady had gone.

With nothing to do, Chen Ping'an was at a loss for what to occupy himself with, so he flew on his sword to the Summer Palace to find something to do.

Ning Yao sat in her room, earnestly writing the character "Chen."

After finishing, she rested her head on the table, dazed.

On the table beside the mountain and water travelogue gifted by Chen Ping'an were several books, each page filled only with the name "Chen Ping'an."

Today she wrote "Chen," tomorrow she would write "Ping," and the day after, "An." 

She wrote one character a day, completing the name "Chen Ping'an" in three days.

Unlike Chen Ping'an, who had traversed mountains and rivers after meeting her, accumulating numerous stories, her reunion with Chen Ping'an after the Upside-Down Mountains seemed to yield a singular story: merely that of Chen Ping'an.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 785: Pressed by the World

On the battlements of the Sword Qi Great Wall, a paper kite soared high in the sky. 

The kite glided gracefully above. 

Zhao Ge Yi and Cheng Quan were unusually seated side by side instead of opposite each other. These two close friends, bonded through life and death, sat together on the northern battlement, gazing into a small alleyway of the city.

Zhao Ge Yi turned his head to glance at the kite in the sky, knowing that only that scoundrel, A Liang, would be foolish enough to fly a kite up here. In the past, that man always had a bunch of hangers-on around him. Among the last group of children were Chen Sanqiu, Dong Bu De, Dong Hua Fu, and a couple of others like Chou Miao, Gao Ye Hou, and Luo Zhen Yi.

Zhao Ge Yi withdrew his gaze, continuing to lament Cheng Quan's lack of talent, claiming that his efforts to refine the mountains were moving too slowly, wasting the protective formation that had once moved mountains.

Cheng Quan held tightly onto a stamp inscribed with the words "not small" in Liuyebiao script, as if he needed to carefully protect that "not small." Instead of countering his old friend's complaints, he asked, “Is it true that the sword immortals of the Haoran world don’t have much love and affection?”

Zhao Ge Yi chuckled, “Not necessarily. Take Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple, for instance — he’s a heartbroken romantic. I've heard rumors that he has some ties with Chen Ping An. However, there are indeed few sword immortals like him who get entangled in such emotional messes. More often, you have people like Pu He and Xie Zhi, who don't care much for romantic entanglements.”

Cheng Quan fell silent for a moment and spoke in a low voice, “If we were to tally our battle achievements, I reckon we could each leave. I’m quite familiar with the second shopkeeper; should I go greet him?”

Zhao Ge Yi scoffed, “What has that brat done to you to make you feel this way? When did you, Cheng Quan, go from cursing people to asking for favors?”

The Sword Qi Great Wall was filled with many disappointed sword cultivators. 

For instance, there was Mi Hu, whose talent was even better than Yue Qing’s. Even though he was now a grand sword immortal, he still felt a sense of regret. Mi Hu should have been the most likely to join the ranks of the Ten Great Sword Immortals. 

Then there was his brother, Mi Yu, who was stuck at the Jade Purity realm and couldn't break through. Along with Cheng Quan, who had fallen to the Nascent Soul realm, and Yin Chen, who had never managed to reach the upper five realms, many sword cultivators at the Great Wall felt the weight of their limitations. 

“I'm not joking with you,” Cheng Quan insisted.

Zhao Ge Yi laughed, “Do you think it's easier for a Jade Purity realm sword immortal who can stabilize a sea than for a worthless Nascent Soul cultivator to go to the Haoran world? It’s all relative.” 

Sword cultivators accumulate battle achievements primarily to nurture their swords; this endless pursuit often leads to a slim balance on the Hidden Officer lineage's ledger of merits. The same goes for sword immortals. The more significant their battle achievements, the higher the quality of their flying swords, but the consumption is equally great. For example, the grand sword immortal Yue Qing had almost exhausted his merits. Mi Hu, too, squandered his on behalf of his brother Mi Yu, delaying his own cultivation. In contrast, very few like Lu Zhi would see their achievements grow without any dwindling.

Cheng Quan said, “You should strive for the Haoran world, take on a few disciples, and find a compatible partner on the mountain. If you’re generous, at least hang up a portrait of me in the ancestor hall.”

At some point, a man had squatted down behind them. The wind was strong on the battlements, and the paper kite danced above their heads.

A Liang grinned, “Why hang a portrait of Cheng Quan? Two grown men sitting close together would easily lead to misunderstandings. Better to hang one of Cai Yun; what a beautiful girl! Brother Zhao could tell his disciples every day, ‘This is the master’s wife, the ancestor’s grandmother. Once upon a time, there was a scoundrel named Cheng Quan who practiced swordsmanship poorly, with an ugly mug, yet dared to covet your ancestor's beauty for many years...’”

Cheng Quan cursed, “Shut your mouth! Last time Zhao Ge Yi helped me move mountains, he let it slip that he himself admitted Cai Yun liked someone who...”

At this point, Cheng Quan fell silent, unable to continue.

A Liang said, “If one can leave, let him be.”

After saying this, A Liang stood up and resumed flying the kite. 

He paused briefly at an empty spot, letting the kite go, which immediately floated away into the sea of clouds.

As he strolled along the battlements, A Liang chatted with familiar sword immortals stationed there.

He approached a bustling spot where three sword immortals were teaching three younger sword cultivators. They sat cross-legged, engaged in lively conversation.

A Liang hurried over, and just as one of the female sword immortals was about to leave, A Liang’s presence made her shy. She quickly wanted to walk with the female sword immortal, taking in the breathtaking view from the high battlements, where the clouds gathered and dispersed beneath them, and the evening glow painted the horizon. Such a scene was perfect for a talented scholar and a beautiful maiden to share their hearts, resembling celestial couples in their affections.

Seeing that escape was impossible, the girl resigned herself to sit back down, preferring to avoid being alone with A Liang.

Among the three sword immortals were Xie Zhi from Fuyou Island, a wild cultivator who had remained solitary for life, having only recently changed her mind about taking on a couple of disciples to carry on her legacy. However, she was not looking for the exceptionally talented but rather those with great resolve and potential, as Xie Zhi herself was not the most outstanding in terms of innate talent.

Song Ping, the female sword immortal from Jinjia Island, was stunningly beautiful, her adornments crafted with exquisite skill, drawing attention. Unlike most female cultivators who favored gold and silver ornaments, Song Ping went against the trend, dressing in striking gold, captivating yet not gaudy.

Pu He from Liuxia Island was an elderly, lanky man known for his eccentric temperament. He was a proper lineage sword master but acted more freely than even Xie Zhi, a wild cultivator. Pu He had remained at the Sword Qi Great Wall after suffering defeat in a duel, often residing at the sword immortal villa “Cui Yu Pavilion” outside the city.

When Pu He saw A Liang, his expression turned sour.

The reason was simple: when Pu He first traveled to the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was this scoundrel who goaded him into challenging Mi Hu, claiming that Mi Hu’s realm was low despite his fame. Defeating Mi Hu would bolster his reputation immensely! The key was that defeating Mi Hu would also mean defeating his brother Mi Yu, who was even more renowned. Not seizing such an opportunity would be foolish. Yet, when Pu He finally challenged Mi Hu, he discovered that Mi Hu’s battle prowess was comparable to that of an immortal.

The three young sword cultivators hailed from the hometowns of the three sword immortals: Song Gaoyuan from the Deer Horn Palace, Cao Jun from Liuxia Island, and Xuan Can from Jinjia Island.

The three had previously met A Liang at the Summer Retreat Palace, and Song Gaoyuan had completed his task assigned by his ancestor. He had conveyed a message to A Liang that he had no further desires for this journey.

As for the three sword immortals, they had all once visited the Upside Down Mountain Spring Flag Pavilion alongside the young Hidden Officers, thus establishing a bond with the younger sword cultivators of the Hidden Officer lineage.

Otherwise, Xie Zhi and the others would not have gathered to meet and invite the three young cultivators to practice their swordsmanship.

Even if they hailed from the same region, these senior sword immortals, who stood tall on the peaks of their respective islands, had no need for such trivial friendships. To put it bluntly, if they “knew how to behave,” none of them would have ended up at the Sword Qi Great Wall, putting themselves in such peril, but rather would have established their own sects back in their respective hometowns in the Haoran world.

Becoming a practitioner of the upper five realms is a different matter than leading a sect; the latter is universally acknowledged as far more challenging.

A Liang sat beside Song Ping, saying wistfully, “Miss Song, how can you bear to part after such a literary romance?”

Once upon a time, a poet from Fuyou Island, while traveling, encountered a female sword immortal from Jinjia Island and became infatuated, penning many heartfelt poems. Unfortunately, he failed to win her heart.

Xie Zhi, not particularly close with A Liang, joked, “Senior A Liang, that famous line of poetry, ‘I have seen you in dreams, your eyes shining bright,’ alongside the line ‘Half for the Dao, half for you,’ is indeed a perfect match.”

Song Ping frowned slightly, “Xie Zhi, mind your words.”

Xie Zhi promptly fell silent.

Women who have risen to the upper five realms, especially sword immortals, are no lightweights; their presence often rivals that of men. Song Ping, along with Xie Songhua from Aiai Island and Li Cai from Beiju Lu Island, are all formidable in battle, each wielding their swords with fierce intent. 

In contrast, local Nascent Soul sword cultivator Nalan Cai Huan’s swordsmanship, though ruthless, lacks the same purity of heart when compared to these three foreign female sword immortals.

Xie Zhi suddenly recalled the late female sword immortal, Zhou Cheng, not out of affection but difficult to forget.

Such women, like deer fleeting through the forest, are rarely seen in the Haoran world.

Song Gaoyuan and the other two felt an immense curiosity about the past entanglements of these senior figures. Hearing tales from the higher realms was like a treasure trove.

Especially Song Gaoyuan perked up, as Song Ping had once made an impression during a peak ceremony in the Deer Horn Palace, leaving a lasting impression on him.

Unbeknownst to them, A Liang shifted the topic, inquiring about the recent happenings in Fuyou Island. He entrusted the three sword immortals with a message to relay to a Confucian sage at the Deer Ming Academy on Fuyou Island if they happened to return home.

Before leaving, A Liang imparted the “Eighteen Stops of Sword Qi” technique to the three young cultivators and agreed that while they could teach it to others in the future, they must be careful in their selection.

The three stood up, bowing in gratitude to the senior.

After A Liang rose, he only bid farewell to Song Ping, who, with a high realm and a thin skin, showed no reaction. Understanding, A Liang swiftly departed, heading to one end of the Sword Qi Great Wall, where he met the Confucian sage stationed on the battlements.

The sage gazed up at the sky, where the three moons of the wild world were faintly visible, and slowly said, “What have you heard to come this way, and what do you see as you leave?”

A Liang replied, “Not meeting in person is like the Tathagata.”

Once a disciple of Buddha, the Confucian sage’s words echoed the literary lines of the Haoran world, while A Liang’s response was a Buddhist saying.

Now a sage of the sub-saint lineage, the Confucian sage smiled, “In a daze, it feels like wandering a familiar path, as if meeting an old friend.”

A Liang remained silent, reclining back.

Earlier, at the Ning residence during a banquet, he had shared only half of a small story.

But Chen Ping An would surely understand the latter half of the unspoken tale, for he was a scholar who had traversed many rivers and lakes just like A Liang.

A lineage sword master, traversing mountains and rivers, slaying demons and monsters, yet mistakenly killing innocents—who could A Liang seek revenge against? How would he take that revenge? If he were to draw his sword, surely he would need to wield many swords to make his point. If he acted out of sheer indignation, how could he ensure the person belonged to a sect that didn’t have a certain girl glaring at him, asking why... If he sought reason everywhere, how could he voice the grievances bottled up in his heart? Drinking would be of no use; how could he find peace?

The reason A Liang didn’t continue was that he feared Chen Ping An would dig deeper, asking what the outcome would be.

So, every heart-wrenching story has a warm beginning.

In the northern part of the city, Yan Ming rarely returned to his residence, sitting in his study with his eyes closed. The little cunning spirit, adept at accounting, flipped through the pages of the ledger, venting to the man about the family's financial troubles, lamenting that they should really negotiate with that young Hidden Officer for relief; otherwise, the entire Yan family would become destitute. 

This little sprite plopped down on the ledger, looking up to ask, “Is it true we can’t reclaim that item? It’s not just any ordinary item; we can’t just let it go like that. The Hidden Officer should at least give our Yan family an explanation.”

Yan Ming opened his eyes and smiled, “Difficult.”

Earlier, during a meeting at the Spring Flag Pavilion, Chen Ping An had mentioned this matter, stating he had been caught in a deadly ambush by five sword cultivators from the Jia Shen realm. The situation was dire, and the item had suffered some damage, needing repairs before it could be returned; otherwise, it would be quite unreasonable.

Yan Ming truly couldn’t be bothered with that.

Yan Zhuo knocked on the door, entered, and was at a loss for words, still intimidated by this father. 

In fact, Yan Ming was not adept at conversing with his son either. When silent, the head of the Yan family commanded a certain authority, causing the little sprite to cough repeatedly and signal discreetly.

Finally, Yan Ming said, “Stop listening to A Liang’s nonsense. Honestly, you’ve always looked like me since you were young; you just need to be a bit slimmer, and you won’t be lacking.”

As soon as Yan Zhuo sat down in a chair, it creaked loudly.

The little sprite burst into laughter, holding her belly.

Yan Ming initially maintained a stern face but couldn’t help but chuckle.

Yan Zhuo scratched his head, feeling a bit at a loss. This kind of father was something he wasn't used to.

In a small alley, beside a tilted stone tablet, two busy children squatted — Feng Kang Le and Tao Ban, who worked as waitstaff at the tavern. The second shopkeeper had taught them the method for taking rubbings, providing them with the necessary items, allowing the kids to run errands and earn some copper coins. Afterward, they would settle accounts based on the number of characters, and as long as they were nimble and quick on their feet, they could earn quite a bit, enough for a bowl of spring noodles with an extra fried egg.

Feng Kang Le said he wanted to learn from Chen Ping An, becoming a itinerant trader, collecting scraps to exchange for money. At that time, his piggy bank would surely not be enough, and he would need to switch to a bigger one.

Tao Ban declared he would also open a bustling tavern in the future, not as a worker, but as the shopkeeper, collecting money without doing any work.

The two children busily chatted about their distant dreams.

On the wall facing the battlefield at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the old sword cultivator Yin Chen sat on a worn-out mat. Having no relatives or connections, the old sword cultivator didn’t even know what he was living for.

Sword Immortal Sun Ju Yuan had kicked off his shoes, sitting in his own corridor, leaning against an incense burner, holding a wine cup, drinking by himself. His sleeves brushed the ground, and a graceful paper talisman beauty danced in the courtyard, charming and lovely.

Sword Immortal Guo Jia watched his daughter gobbling down food beside him, while his wife nagged her to eat more slowly, saying there was no need to rush as if they were starving. She wondered how her daughter would manage to marry if she behaved like this. Would she end up like Dong Bu De, an old maid who was happy?

Guo Zhu Jiu looked up, grinning, then quickly closed his mouth, his cheeks puffed out.

Having bought the Ting Yun Pavilion, Li Cai stepped outside for some fresh air and arrived at the now-empty gate of the armor storehouse.

The sword cultivators from the Tai Hui Sword Sect had retreated after their leader Han Huai Zi fell in battle, returning to the Haoran world.

Li Cai stood still, recalling a time when she was invited to the armor storehouse by the late Han Huai Zi, who had once playfully suggested that there were many female sword cultivators in the Floating Duck Sword Lake, while the Tai Hui Sword Sect had too many melancholy men; perhaps the two sides could arrange some marriages. At that time, the sword cultivators from the Tai Hui Sword Sect had all looked at her, the Floating Duck Sword Lake’s master, with eager eyes, and she had promised to facilitate interactions between the young men and women of the two sects, providing them with chances to travel together. As long as both parties were willing, she would gladly play the matchmaker.

Lu Zhi, who was tall and skinny, was quite plain-looking, but due to A Liang's influence, she had inexplicably been celebrated as a beauty at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In Lu Zhi’s private residence, the blushing lady was brewing tea. This upper five realm spirit had just handed over a plum blossom garden to the Summer Retreat Palace, and she regarded Lu Zhi as a peer, yet beneath the surface, she still acted as a servant, currently kneeling on a bamboo mat and handing Lu Zhi a cup of tea.

The blushing lady gently asked, “Did the Grand Sword Immortal summon many sword immortals including you earlier?”

Lu Zhi shook her head.

The blushing lady took the hint and refrained from asking more. 

Unable to resist, the blushing lady spoke in secret, “Lu Zhi, the more sword cultivators die in battle, the more sword path fortune remains in the Sword Qi Great Wall. Once the wall falls and a new owner arrives, who benefits the most? Naturally, it would be the sword cultivators from the wild world. Does that young Hidden Officer not realize this, or is he feigning ignorance? If he truly doesn’t know, it’s acceptable; exhausting himself for the position of Hidden Officer is indeed commendable. But if he’s aware, isn’t he just a pawn... an accomplice? How can such a person be worthy of your regard, Lu Zhi?”

Lu Zhi retorted, “It seems you have some biases against Chen Ping An?”

The blushing lady shook her head, “I just can’t believe that a young man could do something like this simply because a woman he loves is at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Lu Zhi hesitated, then said, “I can only tell you that this was the Grand Sword Immortal's intention, and Chen Ping An is merely following it.”

The blushing lady’s eyes suddenly lit up, “Lu Zhi, is there a possibility that one day in the Haoran world, we could have our own sect? One that only accepts female cultivators?”

Lu Zhi chuckled, “Women don’t stay put. Even if there are only female disciples on the mountain, will they not venture down for experience? Once they leave the mountain, they will inevitably fall for men, and you will still be troubled.”

The blushing lady sighed, fanning herself, “Blame men like A Liang and Chen Ping An for stirring up romantic debts.”

Lu Zhi questioned, “A Liang is one thing, but what about Chen Ping An? Are there any women in the Sword Qi Great Wall who like him?”

The blushing lady held her forehead, “Oh, my Lu Zhi, there are plenty! Just talking about the Summer Retreat Palace, I’ve noticed that the girl named Luo Zhen Yi doesn’t even realize her own feelings. She acts as if she looks down on everyone, yet she clearly dislikes that man’s every word.”

Lu Zhi pondered for a moment, recalling an impression of a fairly attractive young woman.

Lu Zhi said, “Why doesn’t she like Chou Miao? They’ve been together for some time, so logically, she should like him.”

The blushing lady’s eyes gleamed as she felt a surge of conversation coming on, “Lu Zhi, let me tell you, there’s a great deal of complexity in this.”

Lu Zhi regrettably thought to stop this pointless topic, but the blushing lady lamented, “Lu Zhi, just consider it a diversion.”

Lu Zhi drank tea as if it were wine, finishing each cup in one go and passing her the teacup.

The blushing lady poured another cup of tea, smiling softly, “Many men in this world think that their charm ruins women, yet don’t realize that women aren’t blind. It’s those truly devoted souls who make women quietly open their hearts. Besides, the unattainable is always more desirable. As for someone like Mi Yu, who’s all about flattery and actively courting, he’s truly beneath contempt. How can he boast of being a god among flowers?”

Lu Zhi suddenly said, “It seems Mi Yu has a good relationship with Chen Ping An.”

The blushing lady scoffed, “Neither of them are anything good.”

The children practicing martial arts in the Summer Retreat Palace were also rarely permitted to return home. 

On Taixiang Street, Jiang Yun returned home, boasting to his grandfather about how impressive martial artists were, explaining that sword cultivators couldn’t compare.

When it was just the two of them, Jiang Yun practiced the Six Steps Stance and demonstrated several martial techniques taught by the young Hidden Officers, asking his grandfather for his opinion.

Jiang Shu had initially only been indulging his most cherished grandson with casual compliments, but when the old sword cultivator witnessed his grandson execute a technique known as the Top Heart Elbow, he genuinely looked at him with newfound respect.

The old man hesitated a moment, allowing his grandson to continue practicing, casually inquiring about the old woman who taught him the martial arts. Jiang Yun remarked that the old lady's martial arts were just average, but her temper was poor; she seemed to target him on purpose.

Hearing this, Jiang Shu didn’t get angry but rather laughed, feeling quite pleased. In the old man’s heart, Ning Fu Bai Lian Shuang had never changed, always appearing as that cold-faced young girl. He had met her years ago and had been quite taken with her.

The little girl, Sun Qiu, returned home to the grand mansion on Yu Hu Street. Her elder sister, Sun Zao, who had become a sword cultivator early on and was quite proud, rarely initiated a conversation with her sister. But now, she was curious about the young Hidden Officer’s martial arts, asking if they were really as formidable as rumored. She wondered how that fellow had single-handedly driven off five talented sword cultivators from the wild world, and if he really fed them punches every so often. 

Sun Zao’s questions were plentiful, leaving Sun Qiu somewhat flustered, and when Sun Zao grew impatient, she rolled her eyes at her sister, exclaiming that after practicing martial arts, she still acted so demure. The two sisters eventually sat side by side on the railing, with Sun Zao commanding her flying sword to whirl around them, while Sun Qiu answered her sister’s myriad of questions, as if a student facing her teacher.

Sun Qiu tentatively suggested, “Shall I tell you a story about a cunning fox marrying off its daughter, or about a mountain god’s wedding?”

Sun Zao appeared skeptical but replied, “I’ll listen.”

However, they waited until a family elder called for Sun Zao to practice her swordsmanship, prompting her to jump off the railing, dismissing the story as dull before running off to train.

The tomboy Yuan Zao Hua returned home, discussing the martial arts training with her mother, recounting every trivial detail but omitting how arduous the training was. Eventually, Yuan Zao Hua grew a bit sentimental, expressing her envy for Jiang Yun and Xu Gong’s smooth martial arts training, as well as for the Guo sister who carried a bamboo box. The woman didn’t know how to console her daughter, so she embraced her tightly, gently laughing and softly calling her daughter’s name.

The three childhood friends gathered for a meal at Xu Gong’s residence in the twilight alley. Xu Gong’s home had no elders, while Zhang Pan and Tang Qu from Copper Coin Alley still had family members working in the Dan Workshop. Xu Gong was also friends with Zhang Jia Zhen, who had quietly left the Sword Qi Great Wall, often doing odd jobs together. Zhang Jia Zhen was several years older than the three of them.

Although they were very good friends, their personalities differed. Xu Gong had always been steady, Zhang Pan came from the best family but was the most timid, while Tang Qu was the most cunning.

Tang Qu asked with a grin, “When can we drink some wine?”

Zhang Pan quickly said, “Those who have just trained in martial arts absolutely must not drink. If Granny Bai finds out, we’ll certainly get a beating, or even worse, be kicked out.”

Tang Qu pouted, “Every time Mr. Chen sits far away on the railing and watches us practice, he looks so carefree while drinking. It is said that his wine gourd only holds sword-fostering wine. I’m dying of envy.”

Xu Gong replied, “That’s Mr. Chen; we can’t compare to him. Let’s first learn the martial arts and talk about drinking when we’re older. But why don’t we drink?”

After a brief pause, the three burst out laughing together, “Because we’re broke!”

Old sword immortal Dong San Geng stood outside his residence, once the home of his grandson Dong Guan Pu, who had been killed by Chen Qing Du. Dong Bu De and Dong Hua Fu stood behind their ancestor, unsure why he had summoned them.

Dong San Geng asked, “Isn’t San Qiu doing well? Why can’t you seem to like her?”

Dong Bu De replied, “Actually, I do like her.”

Dong San Geng nodded, unfazed. 

Only the confused Dong Hua Fu didn’t understand why his sister’s feelings had changed so suddenly.

Dong San Geng said, “Then go tell San Qiu directly; there’s no need to feel embarrassed about it.”

Dong Bu De shook his head, “I don’t want to; I still like her when we don’t meet, but being in front of her annoys me.”

Dong San Geng turned to glare, “Stop being so stubborn. You’re acting like a girl.”

Dong Bu De rolled his eyes. 

Dong San Geng laughed, “What can I say? When I see you and San Qiu, I just feel like you’re the man and she’s the girl.”

Afterward, the old man restrained his humor, “Since you’ve come to your senses, don’t hide away anymore.”

Dong Bu De shook his head, stubborn as ever.

Dong San Geng decided not to pressure him further, believing that each generation has its own fortune. These children’s fleeting gatherings and partings were not comparable to those of the elderly.

Dong San Geng looked at Dong Hua Fu and asked, “Do you have a girl you like?”

Dong Hua Fu shook his head, answering bluntly, “No time.”

Dong San Geng chuckled, “Every day you mooch off food and drink, yet you claim you have no time?”

Dong Hua Fu nodded, “A Liang once said he has encountered countless extraordinary people in his life, but he’s never seen anyone travel the rivers and lakes without spending a single coin, a feat never achieved in history. I’ve managed it and must maintain it.”

Dong San Geng asked, “Are you feeling proud of yourself?”

Dong Hua Fu nodded.

Dong San Geng clicked his tongue, “Being so stingy, if you ever find a wife, I’ll take your last name.”

Dong Bu De truly didn’t want to hear the two of them chatter, asking, “Why are we here?”

Dong San Geng replied, “You’re both too young. Young or old, it’s easy to forget things, which is why I called you both here to take a look.”

Dong Bu De said, “The prestige the Dong family has lost, I, a mere girl, can’t earn back. It’s barely manageable with charcoal.”

Dong San Geng laughed, “It’s not like that; the Dong family isn’t so fallen that two kids must support the facade. It’s just that I want you both to remember not to take everything for granted when doing things in the future.”

At the Diedong Tavern, a new face among the drunks shouted “Quickly!” to a group of sword cultivators.

This irritated the drunkard, who ordered several jars of bamboo sea cave wine, cursing that these old bachelors didn’t even have a chance at the bed.

The young waitstaff at the tavern were confused; they had heard many drunken tales and lewd stories, but this scholarly way of speaking was a first.

The young man, familiar with the tavern’s regulars, asked one, only to realize, while the girl was curious and discreetly inquiring, the boy’s cheeks flushed slightly as he shook his head, claiming ignorance.

An old sword cultivator, who had recently been inspired by poetry, expressed to a new drinking friend, “A certain scoundrel once said there are two types of people to be cautious of: those who have never been drunk but drink regularly, and those who have been bullied but never plead for mercy. Do you think there’s truth to this?”

The friend, not quite understanding, asked, “Which scoundrel? A Liang or the second shopkeeper?”

The old sword cultivator pointed dismissively, “What nonsense! Diedong, another jar of wine, I need to drink a few bowls with my friend.”

The sword cultivator who had unwittingly contributed to the wine bill nodded, “At the table, whether drinking or being drunk, we should all be quiet. On the battlefield, the ones who take hits without a sound are the ones we’re talking about. It’s obviously referring to our second shopkeeper; thus, the one with such wisdom must be A Liang. These scholars love to twist words and make it hard to grasp. Come on, while those two aren’t here, let’s drink and curse; I won’t pay for the wine, but every curse will go on my tab. Even if A Liang and the second shopkeeper stood in front of me, I’d still say the same! In terms of drinking capacity, those two together can’t match me!”

The old sword cultivator was taken aback, “Are you too?”

The drunkard smiled knowingly, pretending to be profound.

Outside the Ning residence, an old man appeared conflicted, unsure whether to knock on the door. Eventually, he sighed and returned to the Yao family.

On the battlements, Wei Jin felt a mix of thoughts arise and decided to stop deliberately nurturing his sword.

The Grand Sword Immortal stood nearby, laughing, “I’ve never understood what’s so good about drinking.”

Wei Jin quickly replied, “Drinking may not be so great; it’s probably just a habit.”

Chen Qing Du gazed toward the northern city, saying, “Do you know why the taverns at the Sword Qi Great Wall do the best business?”

Wei Jin nodded in agreement, “Too many sword cultivators, too little space; it seems the only way to relieve stress is through drinking. In the Haoran world, in a place this small, it can hardly accommodate more than one or two sword immortals.”

Wei Jin asked, “Grand Sword Immortal, why did you want me to return to the Baoping Isle instead of going to Fuyou Island? Is it because my realm isn’t sufficient? I could assist a certain sword immortal, after all.”

Chen Qing Du replied, “It’s both yes and no.”

Wei Jin sighed helplessly.

The Grand Sword Immortal did not wish to elaborate, so Wei Jin didn’t dare to pry further.

Chen Qing Du walked with his hands behind his back, taking a solitary stroll.

Earlier, when the ten individuals gathered on the battlements, there had actually been a sequence to their arrival.

Qi Ting Ji arrived first.

Chen Qing Du had told him, “You can retain your realm and head to Fuyou Island to establish a sect. Before leaving, show some real skills. If you just keep muddling through, there’s no need to go to Fuyou Island.”

Qi Ting Ji inquired why he wasn’t heading to Beiju Lu Island.

Chen Qing Du laughed, “You have the nerve to go to Beiju Lu Island?! Let’s not even mention Han Huai Zi; can you really compare to Li Cai, who is merely at the Jade Purity realm? What can you offer besides a little extra in your pants? What can you compare to that woman?”

Qi Ting Ji fell silent for a moment before declaring, “Among all the descendants of the Qi family, I will only take Qi Shou with me!”

“He will follow Nalan Shao Wei elsewhere; you cannot take him with you.”

Qi Ting Ji sighed heavily.

He truly dared not haggle over this with Chen Qing Du.

In Chen Qing Du’s eyes, Qi Ting Ji resembled a mountain-top cultivator of the Haoran world. Choosing Qi Shou meant preserving the lineage. It was clear he valued Qi Shou’s talent.

But besides bargaining, Qi Ting Ji had some words he couldn’t keep to himself.

For the first time in his life, he addressed the Grand Sword Immortal by his name, “Chen Qing Du, do you not feel any guilt watching so many sword cultivators die here, simply because they’re sword cultivators?”

Chen Qing Du scoffed, “If I weren’t here, would you all be? Do you really not understand the order of arrival? You should really consider changing your surname to Dong.”

Then, Chen Qing Du no longer wished to waste time with Qi Ting Ji and called the second person over to speak with him.

Chen Xi departed for the fifth realm. However, he needed to undergo a transformation, born with knowledge. As a member of the Chen family, he had to report to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

At that moment, Chen Xi had only one question, “What about San Qiu?”

Chen Qing Du replied, “She will go to the Haoran world.”

“Who will San Qiu accompany?” Chen Xi asked again.

Chen Qing Du did not answer.

Next up was Dong San Geng, whom Chen Qing Du asked if he truly had no regrets.

Dong San Geng only said that since he first drew his sword in his youth, he had no regrets in this life.

Chen Qing Du smiled and asked, “I heard A Liang say that while you wandered the wild world, you had many female friends and fathered numerous illegitimate children?”

Dong San Geng cursed loudly.

Then Chen Qing Du remarked, “If you can’t even curse, it’s no wonder your achievements are limited.”

Afterward, Lu Zhi, the old deaf man, and Nalan Shao Wei were summoned to the battlements by the Grand Sword Immortal.

Nalan Shao Wei also needed to undergo a transformation, but he would go to the Qing Ming realm.

The old deaf man, during the great war, could drop a realm and return to the wild world. If he wanted to go to the Haoran world, no one would stop him.

The old deaf man stated he wished to go work for the old blind man, as it was easy and stable.

As for Lu Zhi, she had already made plans; she would take the blushing lady to Nan Po Sha Island, while Tong Ye Island had its arrangements, and Fuyou Island had Qi Ting Ji.

Finally, there were A Liang and Chen Ping An.

At this moment, Chen Qing Du recalled something. The young Hidden Officer at the Sword Qi Great Wall was still too relaxed, which was quite strange.

The old man then spoke to the currently residing Chen Ping An at the Summer Retreat Palace, “You should visit the old deaf man, and take care of your responsibilities. Don’t worry; it’s a good thing. Otherwise, if you have nothing to do, you might accidentally find your Dao heart collapsing.”

Just as Chen Ping An was about to ask what it was about, he found himself tossed to the entrance of the old deaf man’s prison.

Seeing the old deaf man’s compassionate gaze, Chen Ping An knew it wasn’t what A Liang had claimed was simply training martial arts.

He felt that something ominous was definitely afoot.

The old deaf man said nothing, opened the restrictions, and led the young Hidden Officer into the prison. 

A Liang rushed over, agitated, “Have you gone mad?! At this rate, he will be crushed by the entire wild world’s Dao!”

Chen Qing Du laughed, “Such trivial matters are nothing; I’ve endured for over ten thousand years.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 786: Cold Weather, Extra Clothes (Part 1)

At the humble abode of the Grand Sword Immortal, there were hardly any visitors year-round, yet the three great sages often received sword cultivators. 

For instance, Chou Miao frequently discussed economic strategies with the Confucian sages, and those gentlemen of the Confucian School—Lishi and Yasheng—who served as officers and recorders on the Sword Qi Great Wall, were well-acquainted with the Sword Immortal Chou Miao. 

In his younger years, Pang Yuanji often visited the Buddhist sages to discuss the profound meanings of Zen koans. 

It wasn’t just the exceptional sword cultivators like Chou Miao and Pang Yuanji; even ordinary sword cultivators were eager to exchange a few words with the sages at either end of the city wall. As Ah Liang would say, it was about soaking in the aura of immortals and the righteous spirit. In other realms, such powerful figures were often not so easily encountered. 

Only the Daoist sage, stationed at the highest point of the canopy, practiced quietude, resulting in fewer visitors. Typically, sword immortals would casually fly over to inquire about the customs and culture of the Qingming realm. 

Today, high above the sea of clouds, the old Daoist, with a whisk resting across his lap, brushed away impurities and the heat of summer, embodying humility. However, the whisk had now only a long jade handle left. 

It was not only a divine weapon but also a personal artifact. 

The other two sect sages also faced a similar bleak situation; after three attempts to forge the Golden River, aiding the Sword Qi Great Wall in dividing the battlefield, one had to pay a price—was it truly believed that the great monsters on the wild, with their thrones, were mere idle creatures? 

As the old Daoist opened his eyes, he spotted Ah Liang arriving. 

The old man forced himself to muster some spirit. That guy looked downcast, likely having come up short against the Grand Sword Immortal. 

Ah Liang lay across the sea of clouds, lightly punching the air until a small hole appeared, just enough to glimpse the city's outline. Then, he pulled out a handful of ordinary pebbles that seemed to have been picked up from who knows where, tossing them one by one, each with a different force, all intentional. 

The Sword Immortal Sun Juyuan, who was dozing in the corridor, heard the sound of pebbles striking the roof. 

A female sword cultivator, who was grooming herself in front of a mirror, also heard a pebble clink against the curtain. 

A young sword cultivator from Yuhu Street practicing in the courtyard was startled when a pebble struck the tip of his sword. 

At a nearby tavern table, an elderly sword cultivator, who was spitting and cursing, suddenly found a pebble in his wine bowl and switched from cursing to praise, speaking smoothly without a hitch. 

The old Daoist was unfazed by this; after all, a hundred years ago, even more outrageous things had happened. 

Once, a pair of immortal lovers, caught in a precious moment of spring, were interrupted by a slight disturbance on the roof, the tiles rippling slightly. In the next moment, subtle movements elsewhere suggested someone sensed their presence and immediately fled. The man, enraged, threw on his clothes, grabbed his sword, and leaped onto the courtyard wall, only to find remnants of ripples left behind in one courtyard. As he pursued, he unexpectedly stumbled upon another couple, just as lost in their own world. Without saying a word, he first cursed their ancestors for eighteen generations, and the two parties ended up in a fierce brawl. 

At that time, a man had been watching the commotion from above the clouds, much like now. 

Ah Liang clapped his hands, flipping them to smooth the surface of the sea of clouds. 

The old Daoist asked a question he had always been curious about, “Ah Liang, how is it that someone like me, or even the sword immortals here, as we age, find little interest in worldly matters outside of cultivation? How do you manage to be so… bored?” 

The more one sought a path in cultivation, the more one would wish to immerse oneself in it. Moreover, to cultivate the arts of immortality with a focused heart was only natural. 

Ah Liang leaned back, lying on the sea of clouds, and crossed his legs. “After all the hard work to cultivate for immortality, what can we do once we achieve it?” 

This was a question with a high threshold. 

It wasn’t something one could discuss with ordinary Qi Refiners, nor could one discuss it with the local sword immortals here. 

However, there was still plenty to talk about with the old Daoist. 

After all, this Daoist master was the foremost disciple of the Great Teacher of the Qingming realm and the lord of the city of Baiyu. The great celestial lord from the Overturned Mountain, though of equal standing, was still lacking in Daoist attainment. 

The old Daoist chuckled, “My time is short.” 

Ah Liang sat up, tossing a small Daoist talisman-like object toward the old Daoist. It was a token that Chen Ping’an had entrusted to Ah Liang for delivery. 

Shaped like a long wooden paperweight, it was very light in hand, adorned with images of the sun, moon, and stars, inscribed with a line of text: “The Marshal commands, grant a measuring and cutting of essence, according to the heart’s pointing, mountains and peaks shall be crushed, hastily as per the law.” 

The old Daoist took the token and, after some calculations, nodded. “Understood, understood, it should be as such.” 

Ah Liang smiled, “Can you really calculate it?” 

The old Daoist nodded, “I’ve grasped the general meaning.” 

Ah Liang then relayed the details in a voice only the old Daoist could hear, who committed everything to memory. “I’ll inform the Overturned Mountain when I return.” 

This aged Daoist, apart from being adept at divination, was also skilled in the art of Mohist reasoning and Buddhist logic. 

The old Daoist’s expression turned serious. “Ah Liang, I have a small request.” 

Ah Liang grinned, “A small matter.” 

The old Daoist stood, bowed respectfully, the gesture not minor. Ah Liang could only rise and return the salute. 

The old Daoist looked around, no longer consciously restraining the aura rippling above the sea of clouds, and sighed, “After all, how many can truly see the deer? Unaware of dreaming each day as a fish. The day has passed, and so has life; like a fish with little water, what joy is there?” 

The Buddhist sage smiled and said, “In the quiet night, the cold water denies fish their meal; why rejoice in vain? A full boat returns under the moonlight, how can one not rejoice?” 

The Confucian sage nodded, “Shaking off dust, one can still see the blossoming branches in spring. Standing in the mud, is it not also the heart of heaven, full moon?” 

Ah Liang pretended to understand, nodding lightly, and then wracked his brain to squeeze out a line, “What night is this, to meet such a good person?” 

The Grand Sword Immortal scoffed, “Ah Liang, can you leave some face for the scholars?” 

Ah Liang burst into laughter; did the Grand Sword Immortal really not know he was the one with the thinnest skin in the Sword Qi Great Wall? 

Suddenly, Chou Miao, the Sword Immortal, took charge, saying that during this time while the Hidden Official was away from the Summer Palace, all matters of the Hidden Official lineage would be handled entirely by him, Chou Miao. 

No one among the sword cultivators at the Summer Palace objected; Chou Miao was trustworthy, with exceptional realm, character, and methods, recognized as the second-in-command of the Hidden Official lineage. With Chen Ping’an absent, it was only natural for Chou Miao to take on the burden. 

Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshi, Cao Jun, and Xuan Can, these four who had been unofficially appointed as the Hidden Official's loyal subordinates, inevitably felt a bit worried. 

After years of close companionship, they had grown accustomed to the presence of the Hidden Official in that position. No matter how precarious the battlefield circumstances were, even when Chen Ping’an was silent, his presence brought some peace of mind. Seeing the current situation, it seemed the young Hidden Official would not be returning to the Summer Palace anytime soon. 

As Chen Ping’an’s direct disciple, Gu Zhujiu merely asked Chou Miao if her master had gone to stealthily slay a great demon of the Ascending Realm again. 

Chou Miao could only say he wasn’t sure. 

He only knew that Chen Ping’an had gone to the old deaf man's prison. 

Chou Miao also said he would treat everyone to drinks, and not return until they were drunk. 

Among the Hidden Official lineage, aside from Lin Junbi—who had returned home ahead of schedule—and the derelict Hidden Official, all the sword cultivators had gone to the tavern in the stacked peaks. 

The out-of-town sword cultivators understood that Chou Miao was simply advancing the farewell drinks; once the battle began, the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage would become fewer and busier, making it a luxury to hold farewell drinks for the four of them. 

Coincidentally, Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, Yan Zhuo, Dong Huafu, and Fan Dache were also drinking at the tavern. 

In fact, apart from Dong Buduo and Gu Zhujiu, the Hidden Official lineage had rarely interacted with the sword cultivators of that small mountain. 

Upon seeing Dong Buduo, the Chen family’s young master, who had been speaking loudly with a neighboring drinker, immediately lost his flirtatious demeanor, becoming as restrained as a young lad drinking for the first time. 

Dong Huafu hesitated, his words caught in his throat. 

Dong Buduo glanced at his brother, who looked like he wanted to speak up, and Dong Huafu had no choice but to keep quiet. Then, looking at Chen Sanqiu, who was almost hiding his face in his wine bowl, he felt an unprecedented guilt. He’d let Chen Sanqiu off the hook for today’s drinking expenses, and instead, let Fan Dache settle the bill. 

Mi Yu, who slept soundly among the clouds, Wu Chengpei, who sat stiffly at the city wall, Pang Yuanji, who was slightly tipsy from drinking, and Chen Sanqiu, who was pushing the walls with his drinking—all were famous handsome men from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

After the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, led by Chou Miao, took their seats, the atmosphere in the tavern momentarily turned strange, with much less clamor. 

Firstly, Chou Miao’s reputation was significant; he was the youngest sword immortal of the upper five realms in the Sword Qi Great Wall, with remarkable achievements, and had set out early with Ah Liang to travel deep into the wild world. 

Moreover, Luo Zhenyi and Xu Ning, the “money-collecting” sword cultivators, were notoriously unsociable. Their status in the Sword Qi Great Wall was akin to scouts on the fringes of a mundane dynasty, somewhat elevated above ordinary sword cultivators. 

Furthermore, the current Hidden Official lineage held more authority and insider knowledge than any previous Hidden Official sword cultivators in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

No one liked their secrets, big or small, casually exposed on paper for others to peruse. 

Lastly, the key reason lay in Pang Yuanji's presence. 

The previous Hidden Official, Pang Yuanji's master, Xiao Xian, had chosen to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall in the most disgraceful manner, taking two sword immortals, Luo Shan and Zhu An, with him. 

Xiao Xian left behind a desolate Pang Yuanji, much like leaving behind that Hidden Official jade tablet with no care. 

When Pang Yuanji fought his way out of the city, every time was a narrow escape, and as a top-tier genius, he was never particularly targeted by the great demons, which inevitably raised suspicions. 

There were quite a few sword cultivators in the Hidden Official lineage; the tavern’s stacked peaks even personally helped join two tables together. 

Two people, one long bench. 

Luo Zhenyi casually glanced over at Ning Yao. 

Ning Yao felt a stir in her heart and returned a glance at Luo Zhenyi. 

Gu Zhujiu ordered a portion of strong liquor, and the stacked peaks specifically brought a small pot of rice wine for the young girl. 

Gu Zhujiu disdainfully rejected the so-called “young lady’s wine,” showing no bravado; if she was going to drink, she’d drink the kind that “only drinks and says nothing.” The stacked peaks smiled and said it was her master’s intention; here, she could only drink this. 

Gu Zhujiu immediately changed her mind. 

After the tavern's business expanded, it not only sold the existing bamboo sea cave wines but also offered strong liquor, and later introduced a type of rice wine brew. The second shopkeeper named the strong liquor “Mute Lake Wine,” and it had no worries about sales; whether rich or poor, everyone liked it. It was inexpensive and had a strong flavor, truly deserving its name of strong liquor. However, that soft and fluffy rice wine brew sold for no high price; the stacked peaks were even more worried it wouldn’t sell at all. The women of the Sword Qi Great Wall, as long as they drank, did not fall short of the men—they consistently preferred strong liquor. If the tavern aimed to attract female customers, they would surely be disappointed. At that time, Chen Ping’an had not explained the specific reasons, only saying that this rice wine brew was merely a small business that added a bit of flair; even if it lost money, it wouldn’t lose much. He had connections with the ferry from Guohua Island in Old Dragon City, which helped bring some hometown rice wine brew; it cost him barely a few immortal coins. 

As it turned out, the second shopkeeper’s business acumen meant losing money was impossible; those who weren’t bachelors would always take home a few jars of rice wine brew before returning home drunk, telling their families this was wine from the Baoping Continent of the Hao Ran realm, from the young Hidden Official's hometown, and insist that the second shopkeeper guaranteed the drink would nourish a woman’s appearance! Some women would laugh and ask, “Do you believe that?” The men would sulk; the second shopkeeper’s tall tales couldn’t be taken off the table, which was widely accepted in the Sword Qi Great Wall; yet the women would still laugh and drink. 

Thus, the female sword cultivators who often came to drink at the tavern later only drank rice wine brew. 

Gu Zhujiu went over to the master’s wine table to toast; after one round, a whole pot of glutinous rice wine brew was gone. Ning Yao couldn’t stop it, and Gu Zhujiu returned to her own table, swaying as if she were practicing drunken boxing. 

The group with Ning Yao finished their drinking and prepared to leave. Fan Dache settled the bill; he was much more well-off now and no longer needed to borrow money from Chen Sanqiu. Ning Yao asked the stacked peaks to keep an eye on Gu Zhujiu. 

Gu Zhujiu had indeed drunk too much and had fallen asleep on the table. She couldn’t hold her liquor, but she was quiet and peaceful when drunk. 

Chou Miao laughed, “Some things that used to be unsuitable to discuss in the Summer Palace can now be openly talked about.” 

Cao Jun swayed as he stood, raising his wine bowl first, saying, “Pang Yuanji, Qi Shou, and Gao Ye Hou have all successively entered the Nascent Soul stage. If in the future, you still don’t enter the upper five realms, I’ll scold you.” 

Pang Yuanji didn’t drink much, but he rose with a smile, clinking wine bowls. “Scold away first; if you’re wrong, when we meet again, I’ll scold you back.” 

Cao Jun looked at Pang Yuanji, shaking his head vigorously. “Pang Yuanji, in my eyes, you hold the same potential for the Dao as the Hidden Official. I hope that many years from now, when you look up, you’ll see the highest point in the world, with the green-clothed swordmaster Chen Ping’an and the white-clothed sword immortal Pang Yuanji.” 

Pang Yuanji smiled helplessly, “I’m nowhere near the Hidden Official.” 

Both drank heartily. 

Xu Ning turned to Xuan Can and said, “It’s about the matter, not the person.” 

Xuan Can followed suit and drank, his eyes bright. “Well said.” 

Song Gaoyuan drank a bowl by himself, propping one foot up on the long bench. “It’s a pity we can’t use the identity of the Hidden Official lineage’s sword cultivators to guard the Sword Qi Great Wall; otherwise, it would be extremely interesting! Looking back, these out-of-towners, young as they are, truly are a bunch of annoying little geniuses.” 

Gu Jianlong said, “Let me say something fair: the most annoying of all is the youngest, who broke through the fastest, Lin Junbi.” 

Wang Xinshi nodded, “Let me also speak a word of conscience; it’s actually Lin Junbi who is the most sycophantic towards the Hidden Official.” 

Gu Jianlong lamented, “If Lin Junbi were to cover a woman’s face, he would actually outshine our Hidden Official.” 

Dong Buduo smiled and said, “Wrong! Lin Junbi doesn’t need to change his appearance; he just has to switch into a woman’s clothes.” 

Everyone nodded in agreement. 

Dong Buduo added, “If Junbi gets drunk, with his little face all rosy, and clings to the Hidden Official, tsk tsk tsk, it would be a sight to behold.” 

Chang Taiqing jolted and quickly poured himself a bowl of wine, grabbing some pickled vegetables, only to jolt again. “Calm down, calm down.” 

Chou Miao laughed, “Are you all bullying the Hidden Official and Lin Junbi because they’re not here?” 

Deng Liang suddenly said, “Have we forgotten someone?” 

At the large table, there was a moment of silence, then everyone burst into laughter. 

Of course, it was that great sword immortal Mi Yu, who had just returned from the Sword Qi Great Wall and was now heading to the Overturned Mountain. 

Pang Yuanji drank modestly but didn’t hold back. 

The youth felt somewhat dazed, inexplicably feeling that the current Hidden Official lineage was truly lively, and it wasn’t bad. 

The drinking session lasted a long time, and everyone returned to the Summer Palace. 

Luo Zhenyi carried Gu Zhujiu on her back, walking side by side with Dong Buduo. 

Deng Liang slowed his pace to approach them. 

Luo Zhenyi, sensing the atmosphere, wanted to leave but was stopped by Dong Buduo. 

Deng Liang didn’t mind and straightforwardly said, “Miss Dong, I like you.” 

Dong Buduo’s gaze was clear as she replied, “I don’t like you.” 

Deng Liang nodded, “I know.” 

Deng Liang paused slightly, his expression carefree, his gaze sincere as he smiled, “I know Dong Buduo doesn’t like Deng Liang, but Deng Liang is just afraid Dong Buduo doesn’t know Deng Liang likes Dong Buduo.” 

Dong Buduo felt somewhat helpless; twisting around like this, but since you, Deng Liang, are so rude, I won’t hold back either. After all, I’ve put up with you for quite some time. “In the Summer Palace’s council hall, a place no bigger than a palm, I’m not a fool; of course, I can see you like me. Moreover, I also know you can’t help but steal glances at Luo Zhenyi’s face and keep your eyes fixed on her back.” 

Deng Liang threw caution to the wind. “Looking at Luo Zhenyi? I’m not the only one; didn’t Wang Xinshi look? Didn’t Chang Taiqing take a look?” 

Luo Zhenyi, a beautifully cold girl, had her demeanor even more frosty at that moment, but suddenly smiled, pretending to be angry was a bit difficult. 

These matters were trivial. 

Dong Buduo and she could say anything privately; what couldn’t they discuss? 

Dong Buduo remarked that Chou Miao had an excellent figure; though he looked thin in clothes, he was actually muscular. Dong Buduo asked Luo Zhenyi, “Have you touched him?” “Never touched, but have seen him, right?” 

Luo Zhenyi held great respect for Sword Immortal Chou Miao, viewing him as an elder, and wouldn’t allow Dong Buduo to joke about him. 

Dong Buduo also said that although Cao Jun was still a young lad, his little face was actually quite handsome, and he would definitely be a graceful young gentleman in the future. Especially his eloquence, soft and pleasant to hear, boosted by his crisp articulation, often sprinkled with rural dialects, chewing on their words, “In the old days….” In the future, when he and his celestial partner were under the flowers and the moon, if he were to affectionately call her by name, lifting her chin with his fingers, it would undoubtedly be quite charming. At this point, Dong Buduo tried to lift Luo Zhenyi’s chin, mimicking Xu Ning’s voice to say, “Zhenyi, Zhenyi,” which made Luo Zhenyi’s charming face flush slightly, enhancing her allure. 

Initially, Luo Zhenyi hadn’t paid attention to Cao Jun’s voice, but after Dong Buduo’s reminder, she seemed to realize it was indeed the case. 

Every time she saw Dong Buduo propping her chin in one hand, casually chatting with Cao Jun, Luo Zhenyi found it amusing. 

Dong Buduo even showed her a booklet filled with words from brothels and love stories, with the women being fox spirits or flower goddesses, while the men were mostly down-and-out scholars. Many phrases were truly indecent, comparing women’s waists to the way a man stood on the beach like a heron; if they hugged, they would either die or have their souls snatched away. Luo Zhenyi only read one page before feeling embarrassed and threw it back at Dong Buduo. 

Suddenly, Luo Zhenyi felt somewhat envious of Deng Liang. 

At this moment, with Dong Buduo’s interruption, Deng Liang lost the heroic spirit he had managed to accumulate. 

Moreover, as Deng Liang himself said, today’s words were just for Dong Buduo to know. 

Deng Liang clasped his fists and said, “Miss Dong, when you get married in the future, be sure to send me a wedding invitation. If the man is a sword cultivator, I will challenge him to a duel.” 

Dong Buduo merely smiled and remained silent. 

Deng Liang turned and strode away, rejoining Gu Jianlong and the others, only to receive an elbow from both Wang Xinshi and Chang Taiqing. 

Luo Zhenyi teasingly said, “Deng Liang is actually not that bad.” 

Dong Buduo smiled with her eyes narrowed, “How do you know if Deng Liang is good or not?” 

Luo Zhenyi felt helpless; she walked slowly, carrying Gu Zhujiu on her back, with the girl’s small bamboo box closely following. 

Dong Buduo understood why Luo Zhenyi had taken the initiative to carry Gu Zhujiu. 

Some things could be joked about, with no restrictions. But some things, not a single word should be mentioned. 

Fan Dache returned home alone, his steps unsteady as he drank and thought of the one he loved. 

Dong Huafu wandered about, keeping a tally of the things he liked and the food he encountered, placing the tab on Chen Dazhao and Yan Pangzi. 

On Taixiang Street, Chen Sanqiu squatted by a wall, his head resting against it, gently knocking as he murmured for it to make way, or he would go mad from drinking. 

The stacked peaks sat resting at the counter, while the young boy Qiulong and the young girl Liu E were busy, and the children Tao Ban and Feng Kangle were also helping. 

Outside, it was bustling and noisy. The stacked peaks looked up, seeing the rows of spirit tablets on the wall, silent and still, like a row of little mutes. 

“Drank the wine, killed the demons, composed poems; my talent doesn’t lose to the second shopkeeper, my looks fall short of Wu Chengpei, my life is quite complete, just lacking a wife.” 

“Money in my pocket, drinking down the tavern.” 

“My swordsmanship is acceptable.” 

“With Ah Liang as my partner, we can slay great demons of the Ascending Realm.” 

“Nalan Caihuan, I’ll be right back.” 

“Flute and camel bell, both are sounds of the wind.” 

“Good mountains and waters are given to idle people, good women are taken away.” 

“In this life, I’ve never been drunk; I resent the wine.” 

“I’ve never been to the Overturned Mountain.” 

“Chen Li, with a dull sword, dreams of flying swords. A hundred years of sword immortals, easily within reach.” 

“There’s no good drink in the world; damn, give me back my money.” 

“Lu Zhi is indeed beautiful.” 

“Life is short; practicing swordsmanship is too difficult.” 

After the old deaf man opened the restrictions, like a host welcoming guests, Chen Ping’an found himself within, his vision suddenly wide open. The world was vast and empty, with little to see, only a towering stone tablet inscribed with the words “Zha Zha Tian.” 

Chen Ping’an steadied himself and quickly adjusted his breathing, blocking the surging spiritual energy from overwhelming him. 

The prison managed by the old deaf man was a broken cave sky, reminiscent of the Overturned Mountain's Huang Liang tavern, with particularly abundant spiritual energy and no sword energy suppression at all. 

There were no other sword immortals present here, not even a single sword cultivator; ever since the old deaf man took over, he was the only one watching over this place, a former demon of the Ascending Realm. 

The old deaf man wasn’t truly deaf; as a being of the Ascending Realm, how could he be hard of hearing? However, the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall had always looked down upon him, and he was a soft target who wouldn’t retaliate or respond to insults, rarely showing himself, which had kept him out of major trouble. 

Additionally, the Dong family controlled the Sword Workshop, the Qi family managed the Clothing Workshop, and the Chen family was responsible for the Alchemy Workshop, making the Sword Qi Great Wall the true meaning of a restricted area. 

There were few records in the archives of the Summer Palace regarding the prison; the texts only vaguely noted the identities and origins of the demons imprisoned over the generations, and the deceased were merely a line crossed out. 

The old deaf man chuckled, knowing it was normal for the young Hidden Official not to trust himself, but did he also not trust the Grand Sword Immortal? However, he soon felt relieved; if he didn’t have this nature, he wouldn’t have been able to become the Hidden Official, nor reach this point. At that time, on the city wall, it wasn’t himself that the Hidden Official lineage didn’t trust, but rather Lu Zhi. At this moment, he didn’t trust himself. Would he end up doubting even Chen Qing in the end? Regardless of the answer, the old deaf man found it somewhat amusing. 

Chen Ping’an and the old deaf man moved forward almost simultaneously, and Chen Ping’an discovered that the stone tablet, appearing merely a hundred or so yards away, would take quite a while to reach if they just walked straight ahead. 

The old deaf man, not wishing to be misunderstood as taking advantage of others, respectfully referred to the Hidden Official and then revealed the secret, “The smaller we make our minds, the smaller our thoughts, the smaller our steps, the faster we actually go.” 

Chen Ping’an followed his advice and, sure enough, within a few blinks, he had arrived before the stone tablet. 

The old deaf man was slightly surprised, inevitably comparing Chen Ping’an to the previous two Hidden Officials. The temperamental girl with the braided hair had refused to believe in the supernatural and insisted on rushing to the stone tablet, only to find herself thousands of miles away in an instant. As for Xiao Xian, he had always flown down, reveling in it, and as a result, after a period of time, by the pace of an ordinary person, he had crossed continents, guzzling down plenty of immortal brews each day, running further and further away from the stone tablet—he had seen many bored sword cultivators, but none as bored as her. As for the earlier Hidden Official, he wasn’t bored, just lacked excitement; however, the merit under the table was not small. That mirage was something he had paid to have built, but unfortunately, his cultivation aptitude was too poor, and his lifespan was short. Otherwise, the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall would not have been Xiao Xian, nor would this young man beside him. 

The old deaf man accompanied the young Hidden Official, both gazing up at the stone tablet. 

The old deaf man raspily spoke, “Zha Zha Tian, these three characters were penned by a pair of ancient immortal lovers who were sword immortals, of high lineage, only slightly younger than the Dragon Lord and Guan Zhao, yet they didn’t have much fame in the Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

The old deaf man smiled, “I believe with the Hidden Official’s discerning eye, you should have seen the trend early on. The characters for ‘Zha’ and ‘Tian’ were engraved by the male sword immortal, with excellent strokes, while the character ‘Zha’ was written by the female, with sharp sword intent, still unable to hide a hint of softness. At that time, she had sustained serious injuries and was slightly fatigued, so the male remedied it. In the end, the last character, appearing spirited and rigorous, saved the middle character, but it was already tinged with pain for the lovers; compared to the character ‘Zha,’ which should have been the most imposing, the character ‘Tian’ instead felt heavy, lacking in sword intent—a real pity, a true pity.” 

Chen Ping’an sincerely replied, “I didn’t notice these.” 

How strange it was; how did he become a disciple of the Literary Sage? 

The old deaf man asked, “The Hidden Official should not be unfamiliar with the River of Time?” 

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Not unfamiliar.” 

The old deaf man reached out, and the three characters “Zha Zha Tian” seemed to disassemble, each stroke separating from the stone tablet, and the sword light gathered together like streams merging into a river. The old deaf man led Chen Ping’an, wading through the water; when they reached the end of it, there was another world inside. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 787: Add Layers Against the Cold (Part 2)**

Chen Pingan's surroundings shifted abruptly; the ground was littered with corpses, a scene of tragic devastation. Some of the bones were pale and enormous, stretching like a mountain range, while others gleamed golden, remnants of divine beings.

It appeared to be an ancient battlefield where gods and demons had fought fiercely in the distant past.

There was a large pit, carved with stairs.

The higher-ranking demons were imprisoned at the top.

As he descended the steps, Chen Pingan suddenly asked, "If it weren't for the Grand Sword Immortal and the Sword Qi Great Wall, how many sword cultivators would you have killed, senior?"

Old Hearing-Impaired Child did not hide his smile. "Everyone in sight would be dead."

He then added, "Not because I'm angry at those little brats' backbiting. It's not worth it."

Turning to Chen Pingan, he asked, "What about you, senior?"

Chen Pingan replied, "Anyone older than me, with a higher cultivation level, and without any grudges against me, counts as a senior."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child nodded. "Good habit."

He continued, "According to the Grand Sword Immortal, he wants Lord Hidden Official to act on my behalf."

Chen Pingan nodded in agreement. He had already figured it out on the way here.

The stairs continued to twist and turn as he went down. Chen Pingan's vision became blurred; all he could see was the staircase, with no other scenery in sight. However, upon encountering various cages of different sizes, his vision would clear somewhat. He noticed the cages were lined with solidified sword light as bars. As they passed several empty cages, Old Hearing-Impaired Child stopped and pointed to one. "The one inside has already had its head cut off by the Grand Sword Immortal. The Alchemy Workshop over there should have made quite a profit."

Chen Pingan said, "The two cross-ocean ferries from the Gold Armored Continent pooled a large sum of divine money to purchase that ascended corpse's head. To ensure a safe return with their treasures, they even paid a hefty sum to hire a sword immortal as escort."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child grumbled, "Those at the Alchemy Workshop are truly annoying. It's as if I'm stopping them from slaughtering these upper-level demons. Whether it's thousands or just a few, I have my hands full, and I gain no benefit from it. Why blame me? Is it that hard to understand such a simple principle? What a hassle."

Chen Pingan replied, "They don't blame you. Everyone empathizes, willingly respects their seniors, and sword cultivators don't look down on you because of your demon identity. How can you still survive? Can you even face yourself? There’s no need for you to overthink it. You should be secretly pleased."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child chuckled. "You're quite right, truly right. Unfortunately, I've heard too little of such straightforward reasoning in the past. That Ah Liang didn’t hit the nail on the head; he just deceived me into thinking that the ascended demons of the righteous world live like immortals, that founding a sect wouldn't be difficult."

As they walked, they finally encountered the first demon cultivator.

It was a great demon in the Immortal realm, coiled like a mountain, surrounded by miasma.

Chen Pingan approached the cage bars, focusing his gaze but still couldn't see clearly.

This prison held six upper-level demons, sixty-one mid-level demons, and at least three lower-level demons.

The dead would be thrown to the Alchemy Workshop, their bodies treasures to be fully utilized. Some managed to leave alive, either going to the Mirage or fighting among themselves or against sword cultivators. Additionally, Old Hearing-Impaired Child had picked out some disciples for training. If he taught them swordsmanship, anywhere outside this Sword Qi Great Wall, it would be a coveted opportunity. An ascended being teaching sword techniques would be something worth learning even in death.

The problem was that here, Old Hearing-Impaired Child's swordsmanship was too advanced. It was too easy for those learning to break through, but once they reached the Nascent Soul stage, they would die.

Many demons deliberately stagnated at the Golden Core stage, effectively burning themselves out. If their cultivation didn't rise, their lifespans would shorten, leading to death, either from shattered Dao hearts or being blown to bits by the ever-growing sword energy. As for the physical bodies, Old Hearing-Impaired Child would still use his methods to preserve them; otherwise, the Alchemy Workshop would hold him accountable.

About Old Hearing-Impaired Child's background, the Summer Retreat Palace had some records. It was quite strange; he was an ascended great demon who pretended to be a sword cultivator, having refined several sword immortals' relics into flying swords, similar to how Chen Pingan had refined his own as essential tools. Old Hearing-Impaired Child's cultivation was sufficiently high, and he possessed three refined flying swords, giving him an appearance more like that of a sword cultivator than an immortal.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child had once been a powerful demon in the wild world, but upon arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had settled into the role of a weary jailer, perhaps secretly thinking of "nurturing another flying sword of his own at the thirteenth stage."

As for the Immortal realm demon before Chen Pingan, it was quite legendary. Initially imprisoned at the Nascent Soul bottleneck, it unexpectedly broke through to the Immortal realm over a millennium in this oppressive place.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child asked, "Lord Hidden Official, shall we make our move now?"

The old man was curious why the young Hidden Official had not brought along that sword-immortal-grade divine weapon and intended to rely solely on his fists to kill an Immortal realm demon. It was hard to say who would exhaust whom. Of course, Old Hearing-Impaired Child knew that Chen Pingan possessed a unique fist technique that could accumulate power with each strike, which was quite formidable. However, as a body cultivator at the bottleneck of the Golden Body stage, his physique was still not resilient enough. To kill this Immortal realm demon, Chen Pingan would not last until his final punch. Faced with an Immortal realm being, the disparity in realms was too vast. Even if Cao Ci came, he would still be helpless.

If he were to seek help and then employ such techniques, he would lose all significance, making it not worthwhile.

Moreover, Old Hearing-Impaired Child felt that unless Chen Pingan was a ninth-stage martial artist, there might be some hope of enduring the pain of disintegration of body and soul. 

Even if the young Hidden Official's martial arts level was comparable to that of Cao Ci or Yu Juanfu, they could be viewed as having a higher realm, but even as a far-traveling martial artist, Chen Pingan still fell short of a full realm.

Chen Pingan began to move, "No rush."

He continued walking, glancing at things before moving on.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child couldn't help but ask, "Lord Hidden Official?"

Chen Pingan said, "We'll make a round first. At most, we’ll waste a trip back. It won't delay the main business."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child laughed and asked, "So this is just about that? Does it matter?"

Chen Pingan smiled. "Consider it a stroll."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child said, "A young person should be more flexible and resilient; it isn't good to be too rigid. While it’s easier to do things precisely and be ruthless with people, it can easily sap one's vitality and harm one's fortunes."

Chen Pingan smiled. "Senior, your insights are indeed wise words. Being overly cautious can lead to a small heart."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child, who had struggled in the Sword Qi Great Wall for three thousand years, was surprised to hear someone call him “senior” so many times and to engage in such lengthy conversation with a sword cultivator.

Chen Pingan asked, "How had the Grand Sword Immortal arranged matters with you before?"

Old Hearing-Impaired Child replied, "When I leave the city to fight with all my might, first, I’ll kill all the demons imprisoned here. Of course, that has changed to Lord Hidden Official doing it personally. Secondly, I can take three Golden Core disciples with me as exceptions."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child didn’t mention his years of cultivation in the wild world; he had endured for over three thousand years in the Sword Qi Great Wall.

After suffering for three thousand years, he was still only at the Immortal realm, without gaining the title of "Sword Immortal."

As they proceeded, they finally saw a fresh face—a demon cultivator curled up and lying down. Looking human, upon noticing Old Hearing-Impaired Child and Chen Pingan, he pretended not to see.

The few upper-level demons behind him, though suppressed, still emitted cold, wandering gazes that felt almost tangible. Some great demons appeared frantic, violently crashing against the sword light bars, bloodied but unwilling to stop. Eventually, they gripped the sword light tightly, cursing Old Hearing-Impaired Child and the unfamiliar young man, Chen Pingan. Chen Pingan stopped, and in the familiar tongue of the wild world, asked several questions, only to be met with incessant curses.

There were also those demons who bowed and begged for mercy, including a graceful fox spirit, still radiant at a thousand years of age, looking as delicate as a young girl. Upon seeing the young Hidden Official, she sat sideways, hand on her heart, biting her lip tightly, on the verge of tears. Others among the demons swore they would become slaves, just to leave this place alive. Chen Pingan remained silent throughout.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child smiled and said, "That fox spirit, even with only seven tails, wouldn’t be beneath you, Lord Hidden Official, if you took her in as a maid. I believe you still have that much authority, and there’s no need to worry about her loyalty."

Chen Pingan didn't respond.

He suddenly recalled the mountain cliff path he had traversed on a snowy night during his return home from the Great Sui years ago.

Over these years of travel, he had indeed encountered many fox spirits. However, he had never had the chance to visit the Fox Kingdom of the Xu family in Qingfeng City. Xu Yuanxia had once said that any man who had not visited the Fox Kingdom would never understand the tender beauty and the hero's grave.

Among the four ladies of the righteous world, one had a close relationship with Ah Liang, the Lady of the Azure Sacred Mountain in the Bamboo Sea Paradise. Then there was the elusive Lady of the Rosy Cheeks from the Central Divine Continent, who had exchanged a plum garden for a letter that would eventually reach the scholarly Chen Chun'an. She merely hoped that the South Posa Continent would treat this upper-level demoness with kindness. Ultimately, seeking a protective talisman from a Confucian saint for Lady Rosy Cheeks was also a long-term consideration for Lu Zhi. 

With a higher realm, one would face greater calamities. Lu Zhi was not the kind of sword immortal willing to act smoothly. Once she entered the South Posa Continent, she would be considered an outsider. Scholars consider many convolutions; they fear the overt schemes that leave Lu Zhi no choice but to draw her sword, which would be a great disaster. Thus, having Lady Rosy Cheeks supporting and strategizing for Lu Zhi was more reassuring. But Chen Pingan also worried that Lady Rosy Cheeks' heavy grievances might subtly influence Lu Zhi.

So, when Chen Chun'an intervened, it would be both protection and oversight, preventing Lady Rosy Cheeks from acting on impulse.

However, Lady Rosy Cheeks was likely unaware of this, still curious about the merit the young Hidden Official had promised. Chen Pingan had no intention of revealing anything in advance; everything would become clear once she accompanied Lu Zhi to the South Posa Continent.

Then there was a lady regarded as the most orthodox descendant of the Moon Palace, whose fate remained unknown. Chen Pingan had long confirmed that it was the Lady of the Gui family, a hidden patron.

Lastly, there was the nine-tailed celestial fox, Lady Huanxi, who had also vanished without a trace.

At the very bottom of the prison, the last cage resembled a watery cell, with water no more than two feet deep, covering about an acre, its deep emerald hue concentrated. It had manifested into numerous small green fish; the water was so clear that every detail was visible. Those suddenly motionless green fish seemed to float in the air. Inside, a young demon was poking his head out, his body below the water completely invisible, appearing as if he were merging with it.

It could be a method for nurturing dragons?

The demon youth's face bore faint scales, with slight protrusions resembling deer antlers on either side of his forehead.

Chen Pingan, hands tucked into his sleeves, stopped and locked eyes with the boy.

He was at the Cave Dwelling stage, having transformed into human form not long ago.

Ultimately, he excelled due to his exceptional talent. On the cultivation path, to earn the favor of the ancestor, one must first earn the favor of the heavens. Whether one can cultivate or not—

Chen Pingan began to head back, marveling, "If he gains the opportunity to practice swordsmanship and cultivate, with a mentor leading the way and further questioning the Dao heart, these three disciples of yours will be astonishingly successful."

Including the young boy, their current realms were Cave Dwelling, Dragon Gate, and the bottleneck of Golden Core.

This cage did not imprison strays or nobodies. The younger the demon cultivators, the more remarkable their innate talents.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child smiled bitterly. "Lord Hidden Official, surely not?"

This young man was indeed troublesome, but he could still be slapped dead with a casual hand.

The problem was that Chen Qingdu would have slapped himself dead before anyone else.

Chen Pingan could resolutely breach the contract and kill all three disciples without a second thought. Considering Chen Qingdu's temperament, would he show favoritism? Need one even think?

Chen Pingan said, "All along, senior, you have adhered to your principles, and I respect you deeply."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child scoffed. "But?"

Chen Pingan laughed. "Since you're so good at conversation, please continue. I am all ears."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child had no intention of making a deal with this young man.

He shouted loudly, "Grand Sword Immortal, is this acceptable? Aren't you going to intervene?"

No response.

Chen Pingan continued, "The three selected by you should all have upper-level potential, right?"

Old Hearing-Impaired Child nodded helplessly.

Chen Pingan said, "Then we can count one as Jade Pure, and two as Immortal realms, of course, as sword cultivators. I will request three opportunities for cultivation from you, whether it be techniques or treasures, preferably ones suited for demon cultivation."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child breathed a sigh of relief; these matters were merely trifles to an ascended cultivator. "Two Jade Pure realms and one Immortal realm. If luck is bad, it could be one Nascent Soul realm and two Jade Pure realms."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child wasn’t deceiving anyone.

A sword cultivator with upper-level potential and whether they ultimately become upper-level sword immortals were two different matters.

To speak of the living and not the dead—Yan Ming, Yin Chen, and Nalan Caihuan, who among them wasn't a gifted sword immortal candidate? And now, what had become of them?

Chen Pingan agreed. "I will listen to you, senior."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child laughed. "It seems that calling you 'senior' is not in vain."

Chen Pingan cupped his fists. "Please, senior, don’t hold a grudge."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child shook his head. "It’s not worth it."

Chen Pingan said, "This cage is, in fact, a divine corpse that has lost its head, isn't it?"

Old Hearing-Impaired Child nodded.

As they approached a cage Chen Pingan initially thought was empty, suddenly a figure stepped out from the mist barrier.

Chen Pingan turned to look; it was a woman with a pale face and bright red lips, appearing youthful. A stitched bag hung from her wrist.

From the neck down, her appearance was ghastly, unrecognizable, almost more ghostly than a ghost.

Her skin was devoid of flesh, almost transparent, with visible organs and veins writhing.

Chen Pingan, accustomed to bloody and bizarre sights, felt a shiver upon seeing this woman.

The Summer Retreat Palace had no records of her.

The woman approached the bars and took a step closer, almost face-to-face with Chen Pingan, who remained still.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child chuckled. "Her name is Nianxin; she’s a seamstress who ended up here during a great upheaval in the Gold Armored Continent."

Chen Pingan understood.

A seamstress.

Extremely rare.

Chen Pingan had once come across her in a secret archive dedicated to unorthodox practitioners in the Summer Retreat Palace.

While not ancient history, it was far too sinister and classified as demonic.

In the history of the righteous world, orthodox talisman cultivators would kill such a being on sight.

The four difficult spirits on the mountain: sword cultivators, Mo family debt collectors, Daoist priests from the sword house, and disciples of the Legalist school. However, these cultivators were merely troublesome; they were the most feared by practicing Qi cultivators, but they didn’t carry infamy. Beyond that, there were ten types of practitioners that could be considered public enemies, far worse than wild practitioners.

For instance, those who carried Dragon King's nets to capture exhausted serpents for their masters in the South Sea, although not high in rank, merely Earth Immortals, yet even sword immortals could not kill them, as they enjoyed stealing from the rivers.

Then there were those who specialized in refining graves, easily provoking the passage of ghost soldiers, termed as "passers."

And the woman before Chen Pingan was the legendary seamstress, proficient in talisman crafting, using human skin as talisman paper.

Her fundamental principle was "to make garments for others."

The secret records indicated that to practice this method, one must first skin themselves, enduring the pain of being flayed as the first step. The second step involved traversing a hell-like realm akin to Fengdu's ghost gates. Afterward, there were several more trials.

Chen Pingan had long found it puzzling what significance there was in choosing to practice such a method.

The woman took a step back, circling around Chen Pingan, and then halted to ask, "How old are you?"

Chen Pingan remained silent.

The woman, referred to as Nianxin by Old Hearing-Impaired Child, was not bothered; she continued, "That shouldn’t be an illusion. So you came from a prominent family in Tai Xiang Street? The family elders finally persuaded Chen Qingdu to help you establish a martial temple, gaining the fortune of the Sword Qi Great Wall?"

Chen Pingan shook his head. "I am an outsider; I practice my punches diligently."

The woman seemed a bit disappointed. "Chen Qingdu is still too cautious. He has many methods he is reluctant to use."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child, smirking, said, "You’re young and only have some flashy skills, so don’t call the Grand Sword Immortal by name."

Then he reminded the woman, "Nianxin, this is the new Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall."

The woman tilted her head, staring at Chen Pingan, and spoke intermittently, "Left-handed. Dragon. Rebuilt the Changsheng Bridge. Both body and soul severely stitched. Practiced martial arts first, then nurtured the flying sword. Your control over your body is meticulous, half a fellow practitioner. Strong killing intent, hmm, it has intensified now. But you can fully manage that killing intent; at your young age, that’s impressive. No wonder you’re the new Hidden Official."

Chen Pingan remained in place, smiling. "Miss Nianxin, you have a keen eye."

Old Hearing-Impaired Child knew Nianxin well, so he was not surprised by her methods.

The prison was strange, with free movement, and Nianxin was one of them.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child suddenly asked, "Why don’t you call him 'senior' and instead refer to him as 'mister'?"

Chen Pingan retorted, "Doesn’t senior drink without any snacks?"

Old Hearing-Impaired Child was taken aback.

In the distance, a childish voice piped up, "This guy is mocking you for loving to speak drunken nonsense and saying things that don’t fit the occasion."

Chen Pingan turned to look; it was a white-haired boy sitting cross-legged in mid-air, his forehead unusually large, with two green snakes adorning it and two short swords at his waist.

His eyes sparkled, and he was bored, gnawing on his fingers.

Old Hearing-Impaired Child shot a sidelong glance and explained to Chen Pingan, "He's an external celestial demon."

Chen Pingan nodded.

The white-haired boy said, "Old Hearing-Impaired Child, quickly call me grandpa!"

Old Hearing-Impaired Child complied, calling out "grandpa."

The white-haired boy scowled. "Why are you so unenergetic?"

The woman disregarded Old Hearing-Impaired Child and the boy, fixing her gaze on Chen Pingan, saying, "Can you really endure the pain? Don't die on me."

Chen Pingan smiled. "We'll see."

Then he felt a chilling sense of foreboding as the woman smiled seductively, gracefully performing a deep bow. "For the young master, I shall add layers against the cold, stitching by lantern light."

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 788: Life’s Dream Within a Dream**

Chen Ping'an was not startled by Nianxin’s shocking words, but rather by the intense and focused gaze of this seamstress, which made him quite uncomfortable. 

Was this the same kind of gaze he had when rummaging through the trash at the Baofu Studio, spotting treasures and wealth on the ground?

Nianxin said, "Wait until you reach the realm of Long-distance Travel (Yuan You) before we talk. I don’t want to help you collect your corpse."

As for whether this young Hidden Official could break through to a new realm and how, Nianxin didn’t care in the least.

Chen Ping'an nodded, already planning his course as he walked along.

Nianxin floated away, disappearing in an instant, clearly unbound by any constraints.

Chen Ping'an threw out three questions in one breath: "How old is Nianxin? What realm is she at? What is her foundation?"

The old deaf man chuckled but said nothing.

Chen Ping'an continued, "I can refrain from doing anything to that boy in the water prison."

The old deaf man laughed, "As a scholar, how can you be so careless?"

Chen Ping'an ignored him, crouching down and lightly tapping the road with his fingers, producing a sound like metal clashing. He then spread his palm over the ground.

Truly, this corpse of an ancient divine being was quite strange.

It was apparent that the old deaf man valued that boy the most and had the highest stakes in him. Of course, it was possible that there was some sleight of hand involved, but ultimately, only three demon races had survived, so the old deaf man’s tricks could only go so far.

Chen Ping'an carefully re-examined the secret files pertaining to the Summer Resort Palace in his mind. He found that the three individuals chosen by the old deaf man were quite obscure, and he could confirm that the previous Hidden Official, Xiao Xian, must have had some dealings with the old deaf man, which was why the Hidden Official lineage had concealed some crucial information. Chen Ping'an had no intention of digging up old grievances regarding these long-standing issues, and besides, he might not even be able to do so. With the old deaf man beside him, a transcendent being, it wouldn't be wise to provoke him. After all, the old deaf man was willing to save face for him primarily because of the Big Sword Immortal. Holding a Hidden Official jade token in his hand while being someone who was not even a sword immortal was of little use.

However, while this reasoning held, business could still be conducted. After all, Chen Ping'an and the old deaf man had no grudges against each other. If they were to tear their faces apart, the younger one with the greater official rank would inevitably gain the upper hand.

Thus, Chen Ping'an's approach to business was simple: he was straightforward in telling the old deaf man that training three disciples here was akin to raising tigers in Sword Qi Great Wall, but since this was at the behest of the Big Sword Immortal and could not be altered, allowing them to leave the prison right under my eyes as if letting a tiger return to the mountain could indeed be arranged. There were many ways for the three disciples to survive.

The agreement between you, the old deaf man, and the Big Sword Immortal, is not in conflict with the final decision of the Summer Resort Palace.

Perhaps the old deaf man had become accustomed to being manipulated in Sword Qi Great Wall, and although he had suffered a small loss, he had at least gained the promise of the young Hidden Official. Thus, he was not angered.

In fact, regarding the three disciples, the old deaf man would sooner or later need to discuss some clear matters with this young man, or else he wouldn’t feel at ease.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, then slammed his palm heavily on the ground, remaining motionless. No wonder this corpse, refined into a small world prison by the sword immortal, could trap those powerful demons.

Now, even the gods of the mountains and rivers in the Haoran realm are renowned for their indestructible golden bodies, but they cannot be said to possess any cultivation methods. Generally, they are nourished year after year by the incense of good men and women, like being coated in gold. The lifespan of mountain and river deities is indeed longer than that of cultivators. It is said that many earth immortals, unable to break through the bottleneck of the great way, would go to extreme lengths to forcefully extend their lives, even colluding with the government and local officials, helping to conceal Confucian academies, secretly building lewd shrines. If they had bad luck and could not withstand the trials of being worn down to bone and having their souls scattered, everything would naturally come to an end. But if they were lucky enough to pull through, their path of cultivation could transition from immortal to divine, allowing them to enjoy the incense of the world. 

Wei Ban should be the exception.

However, Chen Ping'an would never inquire about the many secrets of this former god of the Water Nation and the Mountain Sovereign. Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng were old hands in this regard, so the Cloudy Peak and the Fallen Mountain shared a tacit understanding.

Finally, the old deaf man spoke, "Nianxin is probably around seven to eight hundred years old now. She has stumbled her way to the upper fifth realm, and her talent is exceptional. However, consecutive breakthroughs have harmed her essence, so at this moment, she's in the Jade Purity realm and can only rely on unconventional methods, along with the haphazard accumulation of divine money and magical items, to maintain her current level. In her lifetime, unless something extraordinary happens, she will likely stop here. Nianxin has no clear lineage, and is mostly a wild cultivator who just happened to climb the mountain through unconventional means; otherwise, she wouldn’t have such a rough path."

"But she has no intention of reaching the peak. After avenging her great grievances in Golden Armor Continent, she thought she would die without regrets. Unexpectedly, she heard some dubious rumors that the city lord of White Emperor City has an interest in her. Not wanting to fall into a fate worse than death, she fled to the Upside-Down Mountain. Originally, she wanted to sneak over to the Wild World, where the situation is more chaotic, and her skills would find a place to shine. If she were to run into a dead end, who knows, she might even break through. Who would have thought she was intercepted by a sword immortal and thrown here?"

"While here, she hasn’t been idle. Many of the bodies of powerful demons were disassembled and sent to the alchemy workshop by her. Her techniques are exquisite and save the alchemists a lot of trouble."

Much of the inside scoop was heard by the old deaf man from that white-haired boy.

The old deaf man himself was never concerned with these convoluted stories of others; whether he knew or not wouldn’t reduce his weight, and knowing wouldn’t add an extra jar of wine.

Chen Ping'an withdrew his hand and rose, curious as he asked, “The city lord of White Emperor City would be interested in a seamstress?”

It was not that Chen Ping'an held any prejudice against Nianxin or seamstresses. There are many wild fox Zen teachings in the world, and there are distinctions in the cultivation methods. However, the majesty of that demonic giant towered above the clouds. As a recognized figure of the demonic path, he could still enjoy a reputation across the world. Chen Ping'an had some thoughts early on, including a firm desire to see the torrent of the Yellow River cave heavens and the banner of "First in the World" of White Emperor City during his travels in the Central Divine Continent.

Cui Zhan had once mentioned the colorful cloud spectrum beneath him, and even though Cui Dongshan often spoke of that city lord, it was hard for him to hide his admiration.

Mr. Qi had also traveled alongside the great river, where the city lord had famously left White Emperor City in the colorful clouds to personally invite him for a game of chess.

Such a perceptive giant of the demonic path would be sincerely addressed as Senior by Chen Ping'an, who naturally did not feel he had the qualifications to meet that city lord.

The old deaf man shook his head and explained, “Hidden Official, you truly underestimate Nianxin. She’s no ordinary seamstress. Early on, when she was merely in the Golden Core guest realm, she possessed the means of the Jade Purity realm. A few of her spells and divine abilities, once fully unleashed, could make even an enlightened Jade Purity realm practitioner find it hard to handle.”

Chen Ping'an couldn't help but recall the incident in the canyon of Beiju Luzhou, where the assassins from Ge Deer Mountain had ambushed him. The perilousness of that battle, in Chen Ping'an's heart, was not inferior at all to the encirclement of Li Zhenyu's group.

The old deaf man chuckled, “Otherwise, how could a mere Yuan Ying practitioner alone bring down a sect in Golden Armor Continent? If it were the Hidden Official, it wouldn’t be possible either, would it?”

Chen Ping'an was greatly surprised, unable to believe it as he asked, “A Yuan Ying practitioner could single-handedly destroy an entire sect?”

The old deaf man said lightly, “In less than half a year, all seven hundred of them, including the entire Ancestor Hall, were wiped out. A rather large sect, whose incense was entirely severed.”

Chen Ping'an squinted, “How did Nianxin escape such a calamity to reach the Upside-Down Mountain?”

The old deaf man shook his head, “Why should I care about that?”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “True, why should I care about that? But if I have the chance, I’d like to learn more from Senior Nianxin.”

The old deaf man became interested, “As a Confucian disciple, do you have personal grudges?”

Chen Ping'an said, “There are a few.”

The old deaf man chuckled, “I suppose they didn’t offer enough incense.”

Chen Ping'an was unwilling to delve into that, frowning as he asked, “What about the external heavenly demon?”

The old deaf man shook his head, “Can’t say. If it’s not a business matter, Hidden Official, please don’t make it hard for me.”

Chen Ping'an then asked, “Why does an external heavenly demon wear a green snake crown and a short sword?”

In Chen Ping'an's eyes, that white-haired boy seemed no different from a human, and the other party did not use any illusions.

The old deaf man’s expression was playful, “He likes to show off.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Too reckless.”

The old deaf man chuckled.

In this prison, who was he being cautious for?

Chen Ping'an did not pursue the matter further and changed the subject, “Besides Nianxin and the external heavenly demon, does Senior have any other guests?”

The old deaf man nodded, “There’s also a sorrowful man who loves wine and gambling.”

Of course, he was also quite wealthy.

The old deaf man asked, “Young Hidden Official, are you asking for the cultivation methods of the demon race because there are demon creatures in your hometown worth cultivating?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “It’s not about cultivation; having more self-protection methods is always good.”

On the Fallen Mountain, the growth of plants was all natural.

The old deaf man waved his hand, and a large demon of the Jade Purity realm shifted its massive body closer to the sword-light barrier. The old deaf man reached out, tearing off a large chunk of bloody meat and slowly chewing on it. Since there was a young Hidden Official nearby, he covered his mouth with his hand as a gesture of hospitality.

Stepping out of the prison together, Chen Ping'an began to wander through the ancient battlefield littered with corpses, with the old deaf man as his host.

The old deaf man asked, “Hidden Official, with the war at Sword Qi Great Wall approaching, are we just going to wander around like this without thinking about returning to the Summer Resort Palace to handle affairs?”

Chen Ping'an lowered his gaze, “No rush.”

The young man slowly raised his eyes, “In fact, I don’t really want to go there.”

Every day spent there was not easy for any sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage, let alone Chen Ping'an.

The Big Sword Immortal had previously mentioned that in the coming battle, the Summer Resort Palace should not intervene too much.

They needed to give all the sword cultivators of Sword Qi Great Wall the opportunity to wield their swords freely.

He, Chen Qingdu, would not impose restrictions, and the Hidden Official lineage should also manage less.

Chen Ping'an had no objections.

He looked toward a colossal demon corpse ahead, its bones were too pale, lacking the “vitality” of the luminous white bones of Ghostly Valley. If it were moved to the desolate wilds of the Haoran realm, exposed to the wind and sun, it would likely weather away in just a few years. Simply put, these giant demon corpses were not worth much. On the other hand, those divine beings’ remaining golden bodies, while seemingly sturdy, still evoked a sense of indestructibility, shining golden, with only a few holes that were negligible compared to their massive forms. Unfortunately, it was just an illusion, and they still could not transform into the divine money of the Summer Resort Palace, not counting as part of the assets of Sword Qi Great Wall.

The old deaf man remarked on these ancient gods, though once respected and powerful, they were now pitiful creatures who had reached the end of the great way. Once the golden body showed signs of decay, even the slightest flaw would mean the divine being officially stepped into oblivion, with no hope of reversal.

Chen Ping'an uttered a word: merit.

The old deaf man nodded, “This is the remedy of the three teachings’ sages for future deities and the key to stabilizing several realms.”

Deities of mountains and rivers, conferred by the court and recognized by Confucian academies, had always been crucial bridges connecting the ordinary scholars with cultivators, preventing constant direct conflicts. The numerous local lewd shrines, regardless of the reasons behind the court’s neglect or the Confucian academies' lack of inquiry, were naturally valued for their role in mending local customs and promoting goodness.

As they walked to a place where a deity was extraordinarily tall, half of its body submerged in the sea of clouds, its entirety was unseen.

Chen Ping'an slightly bent his knees, suddenly exerted force, and leapt into the sea of clouds.

With his hands tucked into his sleeves and his feet floating, he leapt out of the sea of clouds, finally seeing the solemn face of the deity. Chen Ping'an stood upon the Pine Needle and Thunder Sword, hanging over the sea of clouds.

His heart grew heavy, “That sword cultivator, Yu Si?”

Surrounding the deity, numerous green water droplets, naturally formed, floated in the sea of clouds, accumulating to over a hundred. The richness of the water was incredible, clearly unrefined, and its quality approached that of water elixirs produced in ordinary water temples, though it could not be compared to the dragon water elixir gifted by Real Person Fire Dragon. Nevertheless, for any water deities, river goddesses, and Qi practitioners, these water droplets were considered treasures, especially since they were easy to obtain and abundant. Any sect would covet them.

It was said that if the Rain Dragon Sect, located next to Jiao Long Gully, could move this god statue and make it the core of their mountain and water great formation, their sect’s power could directly rise a whole level.

Chen Ping'an felt a sense of resonance with this deity, as its aura reminded him of the young sword cultivator, Yu Si.

The old deaf man stood by, nodding as he said, “Quite a background. The Hidden Official is indeed the Hidden Official, never striking down nameless enemies.”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “A small Jia Shen tent, hidden dragons and crouching tigers.”

The old deaf man gleefully remarked, “With the Hidden Official winning three consecutive battles, I suppose the world back home wouldn’t dare believe it.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “So that boy in the water prison is made up of these water droplets?”

The old deaf man casually admitted, “That’s right.”

Raising dragons is a high threshold; one must first find suitable dragon-like creatures to cultivate, then have a method to raise them, and finally, know how to create dragon ponds.

Coincidentally, the old deaf man lacked none of these.

Every ascended great cultivator’s path could indeed make for an extremely exciting strange tale.

Chen Ping'an turned to ask, “If it were you taking action, how did those demon race practitioners die?”

The old deaf man casually replied, “With a flick of my finger.”

With the complete cultivation of a transcendent realm, dealing with prisoners who were at most in the immortal realm, the old deaf man held the advantage of time, place, and people in his little world. It was indeed a matter of just a finger flick.

Then the old man added, “If there was any noise, any curses or pleas for mercy, they would probably die a slower death. I had a little free time and learned some skin-pulling techniques from that young girl.”

Chen Ping'an mused, “Having stayed too long in Sword Qi Great Wall, I almost forgot that sword immortals are sword immortals, and great demons are great demons.”

He still vividly remembered the first time he met the Sword Immortal Ji Yue in Yuanting Mountain, feeling apprehensive and walking on thin ice. One misstep could lead to doom.

Even earlier, on that ferry from Jiao Mountain, he had witnessed the three sword challenges between Fenglei Yard and Zhengyang Mountain, where Yuan Ying Li Tuanjing’s closing sword was simply magnificent.

Even further back, on a night of heavy rain, he had taken shelter in an ancient residence and encountered a powerful demon of the middle fifth realm from the Ancient Elm Kingdom.

What a fleeting moment this was.

Chen Ping'an said, “Senior, you can just collect this water fortune, and I can turn a blind eye.”

Before Chen Ping'an’s eyes, the old deaf man extracted dozens of pale green water droplets, using the method of space within his sleeve to collect them. They should all have been the most abundant in water fortune.

Then Chen Ping'an opened his mouth to ask for half of the water droplets, most of which he stored in his Sword Cultivation Gourd, leaving only three droplets. He sat cross-legged and began to refine them openly, following the incantation inscribed on the rain prayer stele outside the Water God Shrine.

This was a fair division of the natural fortune. 

The old deaf man accepted this without hesitation.

The old deaf man glanced at the basic workings of Chen Ping'an’s water refining technique and praised, “With this method alone, if you are ever driven to a corner, you can discard your physical form and choose a river near a great lake to become a river god.”

Chen Ping'an remained focused, refining those three droplets that equated to ordinary water elixirs at an extremely fast pace. Over at the Water God side, it was like a long-awaited rain, as the green-clad boys became busy repairing the flaws in their water character talismans, restoring the nearly faded murals in the Water God Shrine to color, and the dried-up small pond began to flow with fresh water again.

As Chen Ping'an slightly diverted his attention to speak, he cautioned, “I advise Senior not to go to the Haoran realm.”

The old deaf man asked, “Why?”

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

The white-haired boy appeared on the deity’s shoulder and sneered, “Old deaf man, you’re too good at flattery; you’ll probably get torn apart and minced into meat paste.”

Then the white-haired boy mocked, “You young man, your mind isn’t sharp enough. That old deaf man deliberately picked some water droplets with thin spiritual energy, knowing you would ask for them. On the sea of clouds, the water droplets keep appearing; he would definitely have deliberately missed the ones with the most abundant water fortune every time. What a little fool you are, how can you be a Hidden Official? You’re leagues behind Xiao Xian, no wonder the Sword Qi Great Wall can’t hold up.”

Chen Ping'an ignored him.

The old deaf man remained indifferent, offering no explanations.

In any case, if that external heavenly demon ever found an opening to disturb the young Hidden Official's spirit, the old deaf man wouldn’t stand idly by.

That mysterious external heavenly demon was capricious, suddenly enraged, and indignantly said, “Even the Confucian disciples of Haoran realm are so treacherous, they deserve to be pillaged by the demon race of the Wild World. It’s time to change the customs!”

Chen Ping'an took out more water droplets from his Sword Cultivation Gourd, each one refined into his own water fortune.

A proper fifth realm Qi practitioner, just one step away from the middle fifth realm immortal, would indeed possess greater skill than a third realm practitioner.

The white-haired boy seemed to sense the young Hidden Official's state of mind and began cursing loudly, “You shameless thing, a mere fifth realm practitioner, how dare you feel satisfied?!”

In the next moment, the boy suddenly fell silent, sitting cross-legged again and slowly said, “That Chen fellow, with a full heart, is a good candidate for cultivation. I have five superior techniques that directly lead to the upper fifth realm, the most profound ones. If you have those five elemental life objects as a foundation, it would be twice the result with half the effort. Do you want to learn? I can swear, as long as you nod in agreement, there will be absolutely no hidden dangers. If you don’t believe me, you can ask the old deaf man; I assure you can quickly reach the Jade Purity realm. This is a no-risk deal; do you want to do it?!”

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes and asked with a smile, “Do you think your methods are superior to Lu Chen’s?”

The white-haired boy burst into laughter, and in an instant, a young Daoist wearing a lotus crown appeared on the deity’s shoulder, smiling without speaking.

Chen Ping'an and the old deaf man asked, “With all this uproar, is there no one to restrain you?”

The old deaf man nodded, “There is.”

A sharp sword light suddenly arrived, shattering the figure of “Lu Chen” like ice being smashed by a hammer.

The white-haired boy gathered his form far away, unscathed, but his robe was in tatters. He no longer spoke, as if he had made an agreement with the master of the sword light.

He glared in the direction of a certain place and then transformed into a rainbow light, heading towards a nearby deity's corpse, drawing his sword from its sheath, and began "digging," using the short sword like a chisel and his palm as a hammer. It made a ringing sound as countless fragments flew, dust swirling, until he finally dug out a piece the size of a chestnut of the golden body fragment, crushing it in his palm, and casually applying it to his robe, the golden light flowing like water, as if alive, self-repairing the robe.

Chen Ping'an whispered, “The forging material for the military armor must be fragments of divine bodies, right?”

The three types of military armors, including the Shenren Chengluo armor, had no written records in the various books of the Haoran realm about what heavenly materials they were forged from. Chen Ping'an had never asked Cui Dongshan or Wei Ban about it before. As for the origin of the gold essence copper coins, that was already confirmed. Once the Lotus Root Blessed Land reached the middle blessed land, in addition to divine money, it also required a large amount of gold essence copper coins.

The old deaf man nodded, “The forging process of military armors is complex; the fundamental material is indeed fragments of golden bodies.”

The Big Sword Immortal suddenly appeared beside Chen Ping'an.

But the next moment, he was shattered by sword light again.

Then that white-haired boy, who had just excavated the second piece of golden body fragment, darted towards the prison entrance, but halfway there, he was again slashed to pieces by sword light.

At the prison side, peering in, sword light struck again, forcing the white-haired boy to sit on the steps, continuing to patch his robe with that palm-sized fragment of golden body.

The old deaf man chuckled, “After breaking the contract, he can only stay in the prison for a decade.”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “Isn’t this more troublesome for me? Could I trouble that sword immortal senior to change his punishment?”

The old deaf man replied, “As long as there’s wine, it’s fine.”

Chen Ping'an felt a bit regretful.

He had come in a hurry, and there were only two jars of wine left.

He was reluctant to part with them.

Especially after seeing Nianxin, these two jars of wine could not be given away.

With the entanglement of that external heavenly demon, it was just as well to sharpen his Dao heart.

Unexpectedly, an omen appeared as the Big Sword Immortal slowly walked out of the prison, holding the neck of that external heavenly demon like a chick.

This time, he seemed far less indifferent than when facing the sword light, with the white-haired boy trembling in the Big Sword Immortal’s grip, filled with fear.

Yet Chen Ping'an suspected whether this scene was an illusion created by that external heavenly demon on purpose.

But he quickly confirmed that the Big Sword Immortal was not some illusion.

For on the surface of Chen Ping'an's heart lake, there was a piece of paper manifested by the Big Sword Immortal, documenting many of the sword immortal's arrangements.

As soon as Chen Ping'an finished reading, that paper dissolved into nothingness.

Regarding the future paths of the young talented sword cultivators outside of the Sword Immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Big Sword Immortal had already made a decision, clearly stating it to Chen Ping'an. Chen Ping'an made some slight modifications, and the Big Sword Immortal agreed to some, while rejecting others.

After Chen Ping'an saw this piece of paper, he became increasingly clear about the Big Sword Immortal's intentions.

It was almost in line with his own speculations.

The three old sword immortals carving characters on the city wall—Qi Tingji, after the great battle, left alone for Fuyiao Continent with no one from the Qi Clan’s lineage to accompany him. 

Qi Tingji would need to guard that mountain and water cave for a hundred years, after which he would be free. If the demon race took Fuyiao Continent, Qi Tingji wouldn’t be able to seek refuge in the Wild World either, digging a hole to hide.

Chen Xi would engage in a fierce battle, reincarnating through the method of military dissolution, with his soul gathered in a lamp of his life, taken by other sword cultivators to the Fifth World. Although he could be born with knowledge, he still needed a guardian.

As for Dong Sangeng, he wouldn’t leave. Life and death were in his hometown.

Nalan Shaowei would also die by military dissolution, with his life lamp taken by a guardian to the Qingming realm. Although the path of cultivation after military dissolution would be greatly obstructed, achieving the great way would be incredibly difficult, it was still better than dying and disappearing.

The old deaf man had chosen to rely on the old blind man rather than follow the demon army to the Haoran realm, working hard in the Ten Thousand Mountains.

The reasoning was simple; he was afraid of death.

Many ascended great cultivators were so reluctant to part with their lives that it reached an astonishing degree. Du Mao from the Tongye Sect was the best example; he could go to any lengths, with no means spared.

Sects, offspring, disciples, reputation—everything could be sacrificed.

As for Lu Zhi, the path was paved by Chen Ping'an, and in addition to Lu Zhi, Madam Chuan Yan and Shao Yunyan from Chuan Fan Studio would accompany Lu Zhi.

Connecting to the earlier arrangements made by the Big Sword Immortal for the young sword cultivators, Chen Ping'an finally confirmed a principle.

Almost everyone was destined to part ways.

From now on, it would be a true separation, and in this sense, their cultivation levels would represent a kind of reunion.

For example, Qi Tingji would go to Fuyiao Continent, while Qi Shou would remain at Upside-Down Mountain.

Chen Xi would go to the Fifth World, but Chen Sanqiu would travel through the Haoran realm.

Meanwhile, the high-ranking Marquis Gao Ye, accompanying Chen Xi, would have his sister Gao Youqing become the direct disciple of Floating Sword Lake’s Li Cai, heading to Beiju Luzhou.

The next great battle would also be the last battle for Sword Qi Great Wall in ten thousand years.

For those who were not sword cultivators, it didn’t matter; they could just avoid it. However, in the future, as the battle approached its climax, there would inevitably be demon race survivors slipping through to the north of the city wall, and not everyone would survive.

Lower fifth realm sword cultivators. Those who are willing to die will die, engaging in battle on the city wall; those lacking the ability will still die. But as long as they can hold on until the end, they can preserve their lives and future paths.

Middle fifth realm sword cultivators. Those who wish to live will live. Those who cannot die will find it impossible even if they want to.

Only the upper fifth realm sword immortals. Life and death are not under their control, and the Big Sword Immortal has long since made arrangements.

The Big Sword Immortal stepped out from the top of the prison steps, throwing down the white-haired boy he was holding, and asked, “Tired of living?”

The external heavenly demon lay prostrate on the ground, facing the old deaf man and the young Hidden Official with a sense of freedom, yet at this moment, it could only shake its head, not daring to speak.

A figure shrouded in mist appeared next to Chen Qingdu, with only a long sword clearly visible.

Chen Qingdu said, “If you don’t drink, you won’t have the energy; swinging your sword will be like sewing flowers?”

The reprimanded peculiar sword immortal remained silent.

Chen Ping'an and the old deaf man approached the Big Sword Immortal.

Chen Qingdu brought the two young men into this realm, causing them to fall to the ground, vomiting.

Chen Ping'an only recognized one of them, an inconspicuous third realm sword cultivator from Sword Qi Great Wall, with an ordinary background and talent. The boy was responsible for distributing the workshop robes and long swords on the city wall and often carried injured sword cultivators away.

As for the other boy, Chen Ping'an had no impression of him at all.

Chen Qingdu spoke to the old deaf man and the sword immortal, “You keep them by your side for a hundred years, serving as your masters, and thereafter, do as you wish.”

The old deaf man did not dare to refuse.

The unseen sword immortal also remained silent.

For the two boys, it was a tremendous opportunity.

Chen Qingdu looked at the external heavenly demon lying on the ground, “Shouldn’t you speak when it’s time to?”

The white-haired boy quickly sat up and said with righteous indignation, “Hidden Official should feel resentful; working hard for who? Aren’t I making clothes for others more than that seamstress? Such great fortune, why does it fall on two little brats inferior to pigs and dogs? Chen Qingdu, you’re being unjust; why not simply revolt against Sword Qi Great Wall and scheme for a position that’s not inferior to that of a Hidden Official? That would be a real man’s behavior…”

Chen Ping'an raised his hand to his forehead.

One boy, who would become an attendant of a sword immortal inexplicably, looked extremely anxious, while the other, destined to be the master of the old deaf man, remained calm.

The sword immortal removed his sword and gifted it to the boy.

The old deaf man smiled at the nominal master.

Chen Qingdu led Chen Ping'an back toward the prison.

Chen Qingdu slowly said, “If it weren’t for being here, the one speaking with you now would be that external heavenly demon. Life is a dream within a dream. From the moment you began to gather your mind to refine the water droplets, you would have been taken advantage of. Don’t believe it? You think you’re sufficiently vigilant against that external heavenly demon? Then try it.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly halted, summoning his life sword, the Caged Sparrow.

Then it was as if he abruptly awoke from a dream.

Chen Ping'an looked around, realizing he was still sitting cross-legged, refining water droplets. 

The old deaf man was still smiling beside him.

The white-haired boy, wearing a green snake crown and holding a short sword, was still sitting cross-legged on the deity’s shoulder.

Yet, the Caged Sparrow’s small world did not exist.

It was an illusory scene.

Chen Ping'an felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave.

The world changed again.

He stood beneath the prison, where he first saw the seamstress, Nianxin. She still gracefully performed a deep bow, but when she raised her head, her eyes were filled with mischief. “Am I the fake? Is she definitely the real one?”

In the next moment, Chen Ping'an found himself locking eyes with that boy in the water prison. The boy stood up and smiled slightly, “Are you sure that killing me will spare the Haoran realm from a disaster?”

In another instant, he returned to the sea of clouds, where the “young Daoist Lu Chen” stood on the deity's shoulder, smiling, “Is my Dao method high?”

Before Chen Ping'an could even think, he found himself at the entrance of the prison, where the sword immortal shrouded in mist slowly revealed half his face, saying, “Aren’t you curious why my blurry image appears? Is it because the face of the sword immortal in your heart is manifesting?”

Scenes continuously appeared around Chen Ping'an, though they were accompanied by additional words.

The old deaf man stood beneath the stone tablet of the Zhaotian Temple and slowly spoke, “Hidden Official, as a direct disciple of the Sage of Literature, your knowledge seems insufficient.”

At the entrance of the prison, the Big Sword Immortal held the white-haired boy by the neck, slowly walking to the top of the steps, suddenly laughing, “Did you really think Chen Qingdu had such divine powers? Who would have thought the Hidden Official held such deep admiration for the Big Sword Immortal, only he seems to have a bad temper?”

The two boys were captured from Sword Qi Great Wall into this small world by the Big Sword Immortal. Among them, the more timid boy suddenly smiled, “So the young master in Hidden Official's heart should be so earnest in doing good.”

The other boy shook his head, “That’s not right, not right at all. Even if he is young, he should be as steady as I am; otherwise, he won’t live long.”

Even secretly condensing his heart into a mustard seed and heading to the Water God, those green-clad boys gathered outside the Water God’s gate, all bearing the visage of the external heavenly demon.

Chen Ping'an’s head began to throb unbearably.

Teetering, he returned to the steps, sitting down, and summoned his life sword, the Caged Sparrow, but to his astonishment, hadn’t he already summoned it earlier?

Looking up, the figure of Chen Qingdu at the bottom of the steps turned around and asked, “How is it?”

Chen Ping'an was at a loss for words.

“Chen Qingdu” smiled, “You think you’ve seen through me as an illusion, and you’ve won? Have you really stepped out of the prison? Are you certain you’ve truly been to Sword Qi Great Wall? How do you know that everything today is merely a yellowing dream gifted to you by Lu Chen? Could you still be in your hometown, in the Mud Bottle Alley? How can you be certain it isn’t a fish from the bank observing people? Could you be someone’s dream-walking perspective?”

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and punched himself hard to knock himself out.

On the steps, the white-haired boy crouched nearby, muttering, “Taking shortcuts is not honorable; I’d better not delay his serious matters.”

Chen Qingdu frowned.

The young man, having knocked himself out, was not a big deal; it was the right choice.

However, if he were awakened by an outsider’s punch, it might lead to significant risks.

The white-haired boy angrily said, “It really has nothing to do with me.”

In the end, the young man fell into a sweet dream, sleeping soundly, his breathing incredibly steady, as if dreaming of a wonderful dream he did not want to wake from.

Chen Qingdu grabbed the white-haired boy by the head and lifted him up, saying in a deep voice, “You go take a look, what exactly is happening.”

The external heavenly demon muttered, then Chen Qingdu tightened his grip, and it suddenly howled in pain, having to flash away into the young man’s dream.

Moments later, it exited the dream, helplessly saying, “How strange, there’s nothing unusual; just a little kid bouncing around in a small alley, full of smiles, then it transformed into a snowy little courtyard. The child hasn’t grown much but appears quite happy, and these two scenes keep cycling, unchanging, just these two scrolls.”

The old deaf man tentatively asked, “In the scroll, is there anyone else? Can you manifest someone to break the dream with words?”

The white-haired boy shook his head, “Difficult. The scroll is too hazy; this is a small world, separated from the Haoran realm by a large world. This kid’s hometown seems to be another small world, and I’m not familiar with this child’s life. How could I manage that? If I were to act, it could easily cause him to sink deeper into it, and then it would be beyond even the divine’s rescue.”

In an instant, Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, suddenly sitting up, drenched in sweat.

Chen Qingdu breathed a sigh of relief, asking, “How did you exit the dream?”

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Chen Qingdu shook his head, sighing, “You should now have an idea of how difficult it will be to reach the upper fifth realm.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, wiping the sweat from his forehead.

Chen Qingdu glanced at the external heavenly demon, who immediately assured, “This kid will be my grandpa from now on; I promise not to mess around.”

Chen Qingdu left with the old deaf man and Nianxin, while the white-haired boy did not dare stay longer, fearing that Chen Qingdu might take out his frustrations on him, leaving only Chen Ping'an behind.

After they left, Chen Ping'an began to smile.

He had a wonderful dream, and in the end, he dreamt of someone bowing and someone returning the gesture, so the former was unaware.

It was his younger self, then still carrying a big basket.

Mr. Qi bowed and returned the greeting, smiling and speaking to his disciples as they bid farewell.

Chen Ping'an could not remember such a thing, only knowing that he had indeed thanked Mr. Qi in a bow back then.

What else could it be but a good dream?

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 789: Needlework

Chen Ping'an sat on the steps, rolled up his trousers, and took off his boots, placing them among the white jade artifacts. 

The other two artifacts he possessed—one borrowed from Yan Ming—had already been sent to the alchemy workshop for repairs by a master craftsman. The remaining Daoist talisman artifact was obtained through a trade with Sun Qing, the lord of the Colorful Sparrow House, and he had additionally made a profit of thirty Grain Rain Coins. If all merchants in the world were as straightforward as those from the Colorful Sparrow House, Chen Ping'an wouldn't mind carrying a whole building on his back, let alone a piece of the Zaojing (a type of Daoist artifact). Of course, if that building could be refined into a bonsai like Chunfan Studio or the Plum Blossom Garden, that would be even better.

The artifact related to the Daoist Sun from the Qingming Realm had already been entrusted to A Liang for delivery to a Daoist sage.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an's current artifact had passed through the Sword-Cultivating Pavilion, where he collected all the sword immortals' portraits. Afterward, it was claimed by the senior sword immortal, and when it was returned, it had already been set with a secret restriction that even Chen Ping'an, as its owner, couldn't unlock. He was unsure what the senior sword immortal was up to.

Walking along this so-called "Divine Path," he made his way to the bottom of the prison, gently rolling up his sleeves.

A human body is a small universe; the universe is a large human body.

This saying cannot simply be generalized in Daoist terms.

This nameless prison, along with six powerful demons of the Upper Five Realms, held a total of seventy demon cultivators. Leaving aside the three of the Lower Five Realms, the majority were Earth Immortals, all fierce individuals who would likely stand out as heroes in the Barbaric or the Hao Ran realms. Without exception, they had all fought against sword cultivators on the battlefield, many having destroyed more than one of their life swords.

As Chen Ping'an continued on his way, it seemed that without the old deaf man around, several previously silent Upper Five Realm demons emerged from the misty barriers of their cages, approaching the sword light barrier. Whether in true form or human guise, they scrutinized the young man in a green robe, barefoot, with rolled sleeves, who could still speak the refined language of the Barbaric Realm.

One of the demons, transformed into a middle-aged man, stood close to the prison bars. He used an illusion technique, donning a long green robe that gave him a scholarly appearance. With a bamboo flute at his waist, his demeanor was as graceful as moonlight lingering through the ages. He lightly tapped a streak of sword light with his finger, and where it met, flesh and blood melded together, producing a strange, fragrant aroma that was completely devoid of any meaty scent. He asked with a smile, "Young man, is the Sword Qi Great Wall about to fall?"

Chen Ping'an halted, meeting the gaze of the demon through the sword light barrier, and nodded, "For us, that's not good news."

According to the records of the Summer Palace, this demon had taken the name Yunqing, and his true form was a colorful phoenix. His feathers were exceptional materials for refining Daoist feather garments. Hence, when this demon reached the Upper Five Realms, he naturally possessed a robe equivalent to a half-immortal weapon. However, Yunqing's feathers took a long time to nurture; after seven hundred years of imprisonment, only seven had been collected, which had gradually been sold to three Daoist sects.

Yunqing smiled and asked, "Is Yueqing dead? Has Shouchen ascended to the Upper Five Realms?"

Chen Ping'an truthfully replied, "Yueqing is not dead. Shouchen is now the youngest sword immortal in your Barbaric Realm."

Yunqing nodded and thanked him, then his form melted back into the dense mist, seemingly sighing.

As he passed the next cage, a demon revealed its true form, furiously slamming against the sword light barrier. The barrier was unbreakable; within, the mist churned, and the demon's futile efforts only stirred a blood-soaked wind.

Big catfish in the mud feed on dragon-like creatures, seeking to transform into dragons.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Is there a shortcut for your water clan to transform into dragons? Like the celestial fox proving a path, only requiring the Heavenly Master’s seal on a fox skin to escape heavenly tribulations?"

Many ghosts and spirits cross rivers and climb mountains, needing to travel with those under the protection of virtuous merit to have a chance of evading the divine retribution of local gods. Countless spirits have found their paths blocked by mountains and waters. Moreover, it is said that many dragon-like creatures, when failing their journeys, would resort to various means to seek refuge—whether by seals, jade tokens, or even hiding within the lines of a sage's text. However, some matters Chen Ping'an had witnessed firsthand, while many others felt more like strange tales without the opportunity to verify.

Suddenly, the demon quieted down, slowly transforming back into human form, appearing as a gaunt old man. "Kid, trade me a pound of fresh blood!"

Chen Ping'an responded, "Half a pound."

The demon initially thought this was just a bit of fun, but to his surprise, the young man was serious in haggling?

The old man grasped the sword light bars tightly, his eyes sparkling with excitement as he laughed loudly, "Look at you, young lad, not too old yet but with quite the impressive vitality; your heart's essence blood is worth three coins. Blood from the organs connected to the soul is worth eight coins. Ordinary blood? At least a pound! If you give it willingly, I’ll teach you a priceless immortal technique. Not just the descendants of dragons, but any water clan spirit can transform into a dragon without issue."

Chen Ping'an remained silent, standing still. After a moment, he waited for the demon to show a hint of surprise before saying, “Is the opening technique from the Yeluo River really this trivial? I've seen your master’s methods; they’re not limited to just this.”

The demon before him had quietly unleashed a supernatural ability, a superior water ghost dragging technique. Spirits and demons would analyze one's heart through sight, and at the slightest stir of emotion, the organs would shake, and the soul would be captured, becoming a puppet. The Yeluo River was undoubtedly a vast water domain in the Barbaric Realm, where water clan spirits held great power.

Some water ghosts and water immortals in the great rivers favored using vile "replacement life techniques," dragging people underwater, flipping the yin and yang, often using this method to deceive the hearts of others. Hence, many who approached the water, once their yang energy was insufficient, ancestral blessings weak, and fortune lacking, would inexplicably find themselves entering the water.

The old man withdrew his injured hands, which healed rapidly, with the blood mist burned by the sword light not leaking outside the cage. He sneered, "If it weren't for the restrictions, just from smelling a hint of blood, you'd be lying on the ground right now, yearning for the immortal realm."

Chen Ping'an replied, "If I weren't a sword immortal, I would have already enjoyed a pot of catfish stew with tofu. Water ginseng is quite nourishing, and it can even sober one up."

The old man’s expression darkened.

This demon, known as Qingqiu in the Barbaric Realm, had a name that played on the word for "green catfish," which was a pity for such a good name.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Are we going to trade or not?"

The old man transformed again, the stench within the cage swirling as he revealed his true form, his eyes as large as lanterns, his massive head pressing against the sword light barrier, glaring at the young man without restraint.

Chen Ping'an turned to leave.

The demon said, "We are trading! I'm thirsty, so give me half a pound of fresh blood to quench my thirst! If it tastes good, I’ll take the other half pound from you and then tell you the shortcut for transforming into a dragon to escape disasters."

Seeing the young man nod, he continued on his way.

The demon slammed his head against the barrier, roaring, "How dare you mock your ancestor!"

Chen Ping'an turned back and said, "I’ll let the old deaf man come collect your three coins of heart essence blood. You better prepare a good excuse and don’t deceive me. You previously said half a pound of ordinary blood, and you didn't agree, so I don't understand—do you really conduct business like this?"

After Chen Ping'an left, the old deaf man stood outside the cage of the demon Qingqiu, laughing heartily, accompanied by a nearly oblivious youth named Youyu, whose name was strange, said to have been taken at random when he saw inscriptions in an alley. The other youth was named Du Shanyin. These two boys, who did not know each other, had entirely different attitudes toward the young Hidden Official; the former regarded him with awe, while the latter aspired to be like the Hidden Official, dreaming of it.

The demon Qingqiu, dealing with the barefooted young man, was quite "easygoing." Upon seeing the old deaf man, he immediately retreated into the misty barriers.

The old deaf man glanced at the mist within the cage and nodded, "So this catfish has the notion of water ginseng that can sober one up. I’ve learned something new."

Youyu whispered, "Hidden Official, your knowledge is vast."

The old deaf man laughed, "And he bears a grudge. Don't provoke scholars like this in the future."

The great demon Wangzu, the former master of the Yeluo River, had once slaughtered a South Traveling sword immortal surnamed Yue on the battlefield, leaving the Hidden Official in a precarious position at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Thus, the young Hidden Official had been very polite to the demon Yunqing earlier, but upon encountering the mudfish, one of the four great horrors of the Yeluo River, he began to settle accounts, collecting a bit of interest—anything he could earn was worth it.

Youyu, feeling anxious, said, "Old deaf man, when I saw the Hidden Official, I didn't even dare to speak! How could I provoke someone who seems like a celestial being, I wouldn't dare! Moreover, the Hidden Official has exhausted himself for the Sword Qi Great Wall; I respect that. Now I regret being too timid and not speaking a word to him."

The Sword Qi Great Wall, when it comes to the youngest generation, each person might see the young Hidden Official differently.

For instance, Jiang Yun and Yuan Zao, the martial artists training in the streets, listened to the stories of mountains and waters from the second shopkeeper around the corner, while Sun Zao, who had never seen the young Hidden Official but had heard stories about him, along with Youyu and Du Shanyin, who were still young but could already slay demons atop the city wall.

The old deaf man said, "Fortune and misfortune come in waves; there's nothing to be afraid of."

Youyu nodded vigorously, "I'll remember that."

The old deaf man chuckled, "I wonder what the senior sword immortal thinks; you should trade with that ambitious Du Shanyin. You should get along well with that drunkard; perhaps your fortunes will grow in the future."

The youth's expression dimmed; he felt that his roots and disposition were too lacking, and he must have disappointed the old deaf man.

Chen Ping'an continued to walk at a leisurely pace, as if enjoying a mountain stroll.

A seven-tailed fox demon displayed all its tricks; as the young Hidden Official passed by, it shifted into several different forms in a short span, using its original appearance combined with illusion techniques. It transformed into a voluptuous woman with springtime beauty, a young maiden with light blush, a charming little nun, and even a cold-faced female Daoist. In the end, it even blurred its gender and turned into a graceful young man, kneeling and sitting by the sword light barrier, sobbing to seek favor.

Chen Ping'an ignored it, his heart like still water, observing like a dried-up bone.

Yet the fox demon remained undeterred; when the iron-hearted young man turned slightly away from the cage, it lunged forward, hands pressing against the ground, its voice soft and pleading, like weeping. Its back arched like rolling mountains.

Chen Ping'an walked straight past.

Upon reaching the fourth-to-last prison, he encountered a practitioner of the Dragon Gate Realm. Skilled at concealing his aura, his trump card was two artifacts capable of binding life swords, a ruthless individual who relished in slaughtering sword cultivators on the battlefield.

Regarding such actions, Chen Ping'an had no strong feelings. On the Sword Qi Great Wall, several sword immortals, including Nalan Caihuan and Qi Shou, were renowned for their brutal methods. However, according to the records of the Hidden Official lineage, this practitioner from the major sect of the Barbaric Realm was infamous among the demons for his cruelty, especially fond of purchasing bamboo coffins, considered "mongrels" in the Barbaric Realm, and had even purchased several female sword cultivator captives from the mountain where the great demon Chongguang resided. One could imagine their fate.

Chen Ping'an softly said, "Senior Lianxin, help me open the door."

He knew the prison’s restrictions and the secret arts to open them but could not do so.

The seamstress's figure appeared, and the sword light barrier vanished in an instant.

As Chen Ping'an stepped forward, he noticed she had no intention of leaving. Standing at the doorway with his back to the pitiful woman, he was about to speak.

Lianxin remarked, "Is the Hidden Official overestimating himself? Or is it that out of face, he doesn’t wish for others to see the cruel methods of a Confucian disciple? There’s no need."

Chen Ping'an nodded, rolling up another layer of his sleeves.

About a stick of incense later.

Lianxin glanced at the figure squatting on the ground.

The Dragon Gate Realm demon was left with only its head intact; everything below the neck was a messy pile of flesh, yet it was not dead. The flesh, bones, and soul were layered, and the methods were gentle.

It seemed the young Hidden Official had faced considerable hardship in his martial path, truly embodying the saying "a long illness makes one a skilled doctor."

Even the demon of the Dragon Gate Realm, with a resilient body and spirit, was pleading, "Kill me, kill me."

Chen Ping'an merely gouged out one of the demon's eyes, gently crushed it, and rubbed his fingers over its forehead, asking, "Is this demon's human form each quite different?"

Lianxin nodded, "Not only do demons differ in their transformations, but we, too, studying the laws of the world, share the same origin yet diverge into countless branches. Those methods that can be deemed 'authentic and transcendent' are those that can minimize the influence of detours. The righteous path is paramount, while the secondary paths are lesser, and the evil paths are even less so; they can still ascend the mountain, but the difficulty varies. The more authentic one is, the more accurately they can grasp the intricacies of the human body as a hidden paradise, minimizing detours. The simpler the reasoning, the wider the road, and the more spiritual energy flows, like a grand army, with great momentum. If it’s a narrow and rugged path, the flow of spiritual energy will inevitably be limited. However, nothing is absolute; extraordinary talents are not bound by this principle, and even narrow paths can lead to the peak."

Chen Ping'an extended a finger to the demon's forehead and gently traced downwards, as if slicing with a knife, then carefully peeled back its skin.

Lianxin observed his movements, slow yet steady, and most importantly, his heart was undisturbed, without resentment or joy, making him a natural fit as both a seamstress and executioner.

Among the ten types of cultivators listed in the Hao Ran realm, the executioners and seamstresses shared many similarities.

Lianxin advised, "Killing such a frail Dragon Gate demon isn't worthy of me getting involved in sewing."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Understood. I just want to warm up, as I plan to learn sewing skills from Senior Lianxin."

Lianxin shook her head, "I advise the Hidden Official not to delve into this too easily; it will only earn the hatred of heaven and earth, obstructing the Dao. A martial artist becoming a deity, a sword cultivator ascending to the heavens, is the true path the Hidden Official should take."

Chen Ping'an pointed at the demon cultivator's forehead, rising slowly, "There are no taboos in techniques; as long as one's heart is settled, evil people will have their own way of dealing with evil people. There's a subtle difference in wording between the two statements; the former is too helpless, while the latter is too absolute, and I feel both are incorrect."

Lianxin remained silent.

Chen Ping'an exited the prison, heading to the next cage.

According to the records of the Summer Palace, he simply threw punches at will.

Different techniques shared one similarity: one would always introduce themselves first.

In the Hao Ran realm, Chen Ping'an.

Lianxin followed closely behind the young man, observing the entire process from beginning to end.

When slaying the Earth Immortal demon, Lianxin would open her embroidered pouch, taking out various fine needles and short blades to handle the corpse, while the young Hidden Official stood by, watching.

Lianxin's yin spirit emerged, a peculiar sight, as tiny as a mustard seed, almost invisible, holding an even smaller artifact, a "sewing needle."

When facing a demon of the Golden Core Realm, Chen Ping'an allowed the opponent to unleash their full power without retaliating.

When confronting a sword cultivator of the Golden Core Realm, Lianxin was astonished to see the young Hidden Official vanish into thin air, seemingly creating a small universe.

After removing the life sword's innate abilities, Chen Ping'an observed Lianxin processing the corpse, asking, "Senior Lianxin, among the ten types of Qi cultivators, how many have you personally witnessed, including seamstresses?"

Lianxin continued her motions, skillfully selecting tendons and bones, extracting them with fluidity, though it had little to do with aesthetic pleasure.

Lianxin shared some secrets not recorded in the Summer Palace's texts. Those who refined ancient tombs and graves, invoking the passage of “transients,” when high-level, could tear apart their life flags, risking everything to alter the heavens, turning vast areas into realms of darkness.

Additionally, there were the seductive corpses, whose charm surpassed that of fox demons, half-human, half-ghost, undetectable by immortals, who most enjoyed indulging in palace debauchery. However, seductive corpses rarely appeared, but each time they did, they inevitably left behind many accounts in history.

Moreover, there were the flower thieves on the mountains, who hunted floral and botanical spirits to refine them into pills. Twelve small flower pills could be made from capturing one hundred and eight floral spirits, resulting in a large pill. Their methods were extremely vicious, yet their effects were astonishing, making them formidable enemies to the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land. It’s said that the founder of this flower-thieving lineage had a hidden grudge against the lord of the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land.

Many seemingly righteous celestial masters who publicly eradicated such practices often secretly accepted them as their supporters, opening up vast streams of revenue.

Upon hearing this, Chen Ping'an curiously asked, "Are the goddesses of the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land truly ancient floral spirits among them?"

He recalled the murals on the Bone Beach.

Lianxin nodded, "I once captured a flower thief at the Nascent Soul level and brought them to the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land, exchanging them for a crucial treasure. It's certain that the four flower gods are indeed ancient, while the lord of the blessed land belongs to the later generations."

At this point, Lianxin glanced at the young man, "Thanks to the poetic verses of scholars."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Writing poetry has never been my strong suit; it seems I am destined to have no connection with the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land."

Lianxin remarked, "Are you sure you can return alive to the Hao Ran realm?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "I will strive for that."

Lianxin continued discussing the plague god, which was not purely righteous or evil. A natural victim, loathed by gods and demons, suppressed by the Dao, almost everyone’s fate was not in their own hands. They could either be imprisoned by righteous Qi cultivators, isolated from the world, or raised by evil cultivators from a young age to serve as puppets, threatening the imperial court and acting as cash cows. Once thrown onto the battlefield, they wielded immense destructive power, leading to endless future troubles, with epidemics spreading, and the common folk suffering immensely, leaving no life in a hundred years.

There were also the pigeon immortals, adept at taking over nests. Any Qi cultivator could be used by them as a nest, planting their thoughts and seeds in others' hearts without anyone noticing. There were also ferrymen who could traverse between the mortal realm and the underworld, remaining the most secretive. Additionally, there were debt-collecting ghosts, targeting the foolish in rural areas, capable of shifting karmic burdens onto enemies while secretly gathering offerings from families or temples.

Finally, there were the mirror sellers, who traveled far and wide, capturing and refining the shadows of ordinary people, arbitrarily binding souls and determining fates, draining fortunes for their own use.

Regarding the mirror sellers, Lianxin shared a dubious tale. There once was a remarkably gifted mirror seller in the history of the Hao Ran realm who attempted to refine the luminous moon into a makeup mirror.

If successful, the entire realm, whether ordinary or cultivators, would have to look up to the "mirror surface," and the consequences would be unimaginable.

After listening to these strange tales of the mountains, Chen Ping'an sighed softly, "Those who attain enlightenment live long lives. As long as they are willing to move around and traverse the world, they will encounter endless wonders and oddities."

Throughout their conversation, Chen Ping'an also witnessed Lianxin's innate artifact, the ten sewing needles held by her yin spirit, each glowing with a delicate multicolored light trailing from the needle's end, precisely targeting the three souls and seven spirits.

Once Lianxin completed her task, her yin spirit returned, and she stood up, saying, "I've roughly calculated it. If you manage to kill all sixty or so demons, I can sew up thirty-two places for you. You're purely a martial artist, so the lines in your palms, the back of your hands, and your fingers will all need extensive work. The face and vital points will focus on the eyes, and the heart will naturally be the main event. I'll thread them together and grind the heart a bit, which might take a while. For the back, the emphasis will be on the spine. After skinning, I’ll need to pull the entire spine out to a height of an inch. These are still manageable. The three souls and seven spirits are crucial, and after sewing and dressing, the real suffering begins. Just to clarify, the five demons will serve as your wedding dress; if your realm isn’t high enough, there will be more unexpected mishaps. Once the three souls and seven spirits are lit, don’t say you can’t punch or even move slightly. If the wick flickers, your heart will be unsettled."

At this point, Lianxin pulled her lips into a slight smile, "But since the Hidden Official mentioned ‘a settled heart’ before, I imagine you shouldn’t be afraid."

Chen Ping'an maintained a blank expression.

Lianxin nodded, "Not very old, but quite bold."

Then, the young Hidden Official took up the sword-raising gourd and took a large swig of liquor.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 790: A Good Experience

Chen Ping'an and Nianxin arrived at a cage.

Inside sat a middle-aged man, cross-legged, barely breathing, his body emaciated and resembling a skeleton. Yet, he exuded an undeniable force of fist intent, which coiled around him like countless tiny dragons, nesting upon the mountain of his form. He was a genuine Wanderer of the Beyond.

Before Chen Ping'an arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, this pure warrior from the wild had killed six sword cultivators, including one Earth Immortal sword cultivator.

The man opened his eyes and asked, "Have you come to kill me?"

Chen Ping'an nodded.

The man glanced at the seamstress behind Chen Ping'an and said calmly, "You brought your own head on a platter."

He recognized he was no match for that hideous woman; her methods were vicious, and she had caused him considerable suffering.

Chen Ping'an said, "Let's have a duel and see who lives or dies."

The man scoffed, "A mere pure warrior from the Sword Qi Great Wall wants to use me as a whetstone? I fear that one punch from me will have you groaning in pain while clutching that woman's waist. Haha, too bad she isn’t much to look at."

Chen Ping'an replied, "Nianxin, close the cage door. Let’s wait until one of us is dead before opening it again."

Nianxin shut the door, and sword lights formed a barrier, enclosing the two warriors.

The man stood up. "Well, that’s straightforward."

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists and introduced himself, "In the name of righteousness, I am Chen Ping'an."

The man was momentarily taken aback but returned the gesture, "From the wild, Jinxi City, I am Hongyin."

One was a Wanderer of the Beyond, the other a bottlenecked Gold Body Realm cultivator; both struck at the same time.

Inside the cage, the force of their fists surged.

In an instant, they exchanged dozens of blows. Chen Ping'an primarily used his fists and feet to counter Hongyin's attacks, defending more than he attacked. Eventually, a kick from Hongyin landed on his waist, causing Chen Ping'an to slide back over ten feet. Yet, he remained firmly rooted to the ground. As Hongyin pushed forward, Chen Ping'an sidestepped, raising a leg to strike Hongyin's abdomen. The force shifted, pinning Hongyin to the ground.

Rather than follow up with an attack, Chen Ping'an retreated two steps, placing one hand behind him and transforming his fist into a palm in front of him.

His fist stance sank slightly, yet the intent behind it gradually rose.

Unharmed, Hongyin pushed himself off the ground and asked, "Are you holding back?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "I know your foundation, but you don’t know mine. So let’s see how you fare against a hundred blows from me. After that, we’ll see."

Hongyin twisted his wrist, the joints in his spine and ribs cracking like a dragon turning over. His fist intent exploded forth, his spirit surging.

Earlier, he had been testing the waters, and now he laughed, "If you truly have confidence, you’d need to be at the Ninth Realm to back it up."

He had only heard of the pure warriors from the Righteous World, limited by their innate physiques, and considered them weak.

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I am not yet a Wanderer of the Beyond. However, I fought and killed Hou Kuimen on the battlefield, which cost me dearly, and I'm still not fully healed. But to be straightforward, when I face an enemy, whether injured or not, it makes no difference."

As Hongyin moved closer, Chen Ping'an remained still, not even shifting his gaze as Hongyin walked a short arc in front of him.

As a dominant Wanderer of the Beyond, Hongyin had certainly heard of that flamboyant Hou Kuimen, though he had never met him. He had only heard tales of the man, adorned in bright red armor, wearing a purple-golden crown with long feathers, and draped in treasures. Thus, he held little respect for Hou Kuimen. A true warrior should be unencumbered by possessions, relying solely on his fists, like the barefoot, rolled-sleeved young man before him—pure and straightforward.

Hongyin asked, "Is it customary for warriors in the Righteous World to explain themselves before fighting? Is there some strange custom in this?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I just want you to throw your punches with a clear conscience before you die."

After a pause, he continued earnestly, "You haven’t fought in a long time; your skills are rusty, and you’re too concerned about the woman outside the cage. Your fist intent isn’t at its peak. I could easily kill you with a few blows, but what would be the point?"

Hongyin ceased his words.

In a duel between warriors, regardless of the size of the principles, it all came down to the weight of their fists and the height of their techniques.

For the next hundred blows, Hongyin struck fiercely, his momentum like a whale swallowing a rainbow, living up to his name.

A knee strike crashed into Chen Ping'an's chest, sending him sliding back ten steps. He merely assumed a stance without retaliating, his spine like a dragon pulse trembling, absorbing all the force.

Hongyin simultaneously struck hard at Chen Ping'an's shoulder, taking advantage of the young man's slight shift in position to surge forward. He nearly slammed Chen Ping'an against the sword-light barrier.

Yet, the young man’s expression, complexion, and even his fist intent remained eerily calm and unmoving.

Hongyin's last kick struck Chen Ping'an’s neck, flipping him around several times until he caught himself with a hand, head down, feet up, and froze in position.

His eyes were tightly shut, and his left hand formed a sword seal before him.

In the last few punches of their hundred, Hongyin twisted his body, his long arms delivering a crushing blow that sent Chen Ping'an flying. The young man’s energy plummeted as he used his fingers to touch the ground, flipping repeatedly to avoid the barrage of punches from Hongyin, finally standing in a straight line between Hongyin and Nianxin.

The sparring session came to an end; it wasn't that Hongyin didn’t want to determine their lives in an instant, but his warrior instincts warned him against carelessly approaching Chen Ping'an again.

He stopped in his tracks, quite surprised, while Nianxin looked on curiously.

As a half-wild cultivator from Gold Armor Continent, Nianxin had traveled for hundreds of years and was quite familiar with pure warriors from the Righteous World. Even among Ninth Realm warriors, there had been a rapid and intense clash. 

When did a young man in his thirties acquire such a masterful demeanor? The Wanderers of the Beyond and mountain-top masters she had seen before all exuded overwhelming presence, even when their divine radiance was restrained. Once they unleashed their fists, they embodied a heroic spirit that could shake mountains and shatter the earth; none had the calm and composure of this young man.

As the two continued their spar, Nianxin noticed some peculiarities; Chen Ping'an’s choices seemed increasingly odd, as if he had changed his mind.

Hongyin was fighting with great gusto, while Chen Ping'an remained restrained, mostly focusing on defense rather than evasion.

After about half a stick of incense had burned, Hongyin suddenly withdrew his fists, puzzled. "I've already exchanged two full breaths of true warrior's energy, yet you’ve only used one breath to counter?"

Chen Ping'an wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his thumb, answering evasively, "I'll come back in a few days for another spar."

Hongyin shook his head and took a deep breath, speaking seriously, "It’s one thing to look down on Jinxi City’s Hongyin, but if a warrior’s skills are lacking, that’s understandable. Yet, do you, Chen Ping'an, think you can look down on warriors?!"

Chen Ping'an fell silent for a moment before nodding. "You have reason, senior."

Finally, he allowed a pulse of pure true energy to flow through him. On the surface, his stance appeared relaxed, like a monkey, but internally, it was like a great dragon bracing itself, directly adopting a divine drum-like stance.

As he faced death, Hongyin's expression changed, akin to a fish caught on a hook, suddenly freed.

As was customary, Nianxin collected the corpse.

However, this time, Chen Ping'an did not observe; instead, he sat outside the cage, taking a sip of wine.

Having long mastered various sewing techniques, Nianxin seemed to have time to spare, asking, "How did you cultivate this fist technique?"

Chen Ping'an, with his back to the cage, slowly replied, "The one who taught me the fist technique didn't like to discuss fist theory, only imparted a few words, one of which I have never forgotten: 'My fists reach the heavens, and before me, there is no one.'"

Nianxin nodded, "That warrior has quite the spirit."

After that, Chen Ping'an moved on to the next cell, where a demon clan member was held—a bottlenecked Gold Dan sword cultivator.

This sword cultivator hailed from a sword sect known as the Ascendant Sect.

In the wild, sword sects were few and far between, unlike in the Righteous World. It wasn’t just any Fifth Realm sword immortal who could establish a sect in the wild. Even if a sect’s banner could be raised, it would not withstand the harsh reality. Great demons roamed freely, mercilessly; they particularly despised sword sects, and while they might spare human lives, they would wreak havoc on the natural formations, leaving no one unscathed.

Thus, every sword sect in the wild that managed to survive its first hundred years became a formidable power.

According to secret records from the Summer Palace, the Ascendant Sect had once harbored a sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall. When this was later discovered, a massacre ensued. The Ascendant Sect employed various sinister methods to imprison the sword immortal's spirit, forcibly extracting sword techniques from him. Ultimately, the sword immortal was refined into a puppet with diminished intelligence, bound to obey others. He had appeared during a siege and was slain by the chief offering of the Yan family, Li Tui, thus gaining liberation.

Upon entering this cage, after Nianxin opened the door, Chen Ping'an introduced himself and simply uttered the words "Ask for the sword," before summoning the caged sparrow.

Unexpectedly, the Gold Dan bottleneck sword cultivator immediately knelt, fervently vowing loyalty to Chen Ping'an in exchange for his life.

Seeing the young man remain unmoved, this sword cultivator grew even more resolute, offering to sacrifice his foundational path by severing his life-bound flying sword to gift it to Chen Ping'an, hoping to prolong his existence in this cage.

This direct descendant of the Ascendant Sect’s ancestral hall was unpredictable in battle, wielding his life-bound flying sword, "Celestial Melody," which possessed two unique abilities. Wherever the flying sword passed, there was no sword to see, only the delicate sound of buzzing wings. If this sound reached a person’s ear, it would resonate violently within their meridians, carrying a tremendous killing force. Furthermore, the thunderous sound of the flying sword inherently contained the true essence of the Five Thunders, making it exceedingly difficult for enemies to defend against. Upon realizing the presence of the flying sword, one had to discern its location by sound, but once the sound was heard, the sword would swiftly pierce the sword cultivator’s body.

The moment the sword intent moved, the minuscule universe within his body would erupt with wind, thunder, clouds, and rain.

It was precisely because this demon sword cultivator’s flying sword was so aberrant that it had been specifically targeted by two sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall, leading to its imprisonment.

After acquiring the "Celestial Melody," Chen Ping'an stored it away and inquired about the Ascendant Sect's sword techniques, finding some records in the Summer Palace. He asked a few additional questions to fill in the gaps.

Chen Ping'an exchanged a knowing glance with Nianxin, who immediately understood and stepped into the cell.

At the same time, a small but exquisite Yin God emerged, holding ten shimmering “embroidery needles.”

Realizing his imminent demise, the sword cultivator cursed and spat at Chen Ping'an.

Nianxin felt satisfied; earlier, Hongyin’s death had been too fulfilling, leaving the young Hidden Official with too little resentment, which was not a good thing.

Nianxin's sewing methods not only involved the three souls and seven spirits but could also gather grievances.

Chen Ping'an stood at the entrance, taking another sip of wine, savoring it sparingly. He thought he shouldn’t wait until he truly faced hardship before he could no longer drink.

Nianxin toyed with the sword cultivator’s Gold Dan and casually remarked, "One must pursue their responsibilities while in their position; it’s impossible for everything to go smoothly."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I’ve long come to terms with this. Killing demons at the Sword Qi Great Wall doesn’t require justification. Whether one is a Hidden Official or not, it’s all the same. The discomfort comes from my own low realm; facing any of those king-level demons now would mean death. Not to mention, confronting a Yuan Ying sword cultivator would be extremely taxing. Facing a sword immortal, I would undoubtedly perish. Becoming a sword immortal is incredibly difficult."

Nianxin laughed, "You’re a Fifth Realm sword cultivator at such a young age; I don’t see that as too difficult."

Chen Ping'an was left speechless.

It was rare for the seamstress to make a joke, and it felt quite chilling.

Earlier, the old deaf man had asked for three portions of blood essence from the mud eel spirit. Now, the young Hidden Official was conducting business that seemed unearthly.

The old deaf man had also obtained a few pounds of blood and flesh from the younger generation of the Yalu River, after all, he had taken in a so-called master boy, who, by the looks of it, was someone who could cook. With a good jug of wine and a pot of the young Hidden Official’s so-called mud eel tofu stew, it truly felt like a heavenly life.

As for the title of the honest young master, would the old deaf man take it seriously? Did he truly think he was a transcendent being who ascended after devoting himself to Buddhism?

The great sword immortal acted this way, merely providing a chance for the melancholy figure, at most just a protective charm. As long as the young man couldn’t seize the opportunity, the deadline of a hundred years would be the pinnacle of clarity regarding life and death. If it were that clever Du Shanyin, the old deaf man could already contemplate how to handle matters a century later, which is to say, the foolish would have their fortunes, and the melancholy child was simply too naive; the old deaf man felt embarrassed to take action since it lacked any interest.

And as for the melancholy boy, he didn’t take the master-servant relationship seriously; it was merely the young man’s true path to survival.

Thus, reading more books was indeed a good thing. As the young Hidden Official had said, one should never underestimate a transcendent being.

The melancholy boy was grabbed by the old deaf man and led out of the suffocating dungeon, winding past several demon corpses and broken divine beings, toward a place that brought peace to the young man’s heart. The gentle stream flowed, and in front of a thatched cottage by the creek, a massive grape trellis was built, lush and verdant, covering an expanse of land, where one could walk among the greenery, their attire turning azure in the shade.

With every breath the melancholy boy took, he felt a refreshing sensation, as if both the spiritual and sword energies had been refined, enabling one to bypass the Qi refining stage. The more this was the case, the more the reserved young man dared not breathe deeply. After all, he was a guest visiting.

The old deaf man smiled, "Just breathe and direct your energy; it won’t hurt your spiritual energy. A small fish swimming in the river can still drink the water without drying it up."

The old deaf man paused. "The master hasn’t returned yet; let’s wait a moment."

The melancholy boy nodded vigorously, feeling quite nervous.

This was because the elder had mentioned the identity of that sword immortal, the Executioner.

An ancient position in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall that had disappeared for many years, on par with the Hidden Officials.

The old deaf man didn’t elaborate, only mentioning that the Executioner sword immortal felt guilty and believed he had no face to show others.

In another direction, the two walked slowly along the creek. It was indeed the sword immortal, whose face was obscured, walking alongside the young Du Shanyin.

Du Shanyin had several small bags woven from silver threads tied around his waist, gleaming like gold, radiant as the morning sun.

The old deaf man chuckled, "No wonder."

In this realm, the corpses of great demons and deities lay in an unseen river of time, their bones gradually decaying, eroding, and peeling away. However, those divine golden bodies occasionally yielded surprises, such as heaps of golden sand or fragments of their golden bodies. The young Hidden Official had been particularly unfortunate in his explorations, finding nothing, while the young Du Shanyin, accompanied by the sword immortal, returned laden with treasures.

The sword immortal certainly wouldn’t actively seek to destroy the divine corpses, merely waiting for treasures to fall from the sky, then bending down to pick them up.

It was likely that this journey with Du Shanyin was to observe the young man’s fortune.

By the creek, a woman was beating cloth on a blue stone slab, and when Du Shanyin called out, she suddenly looked up, her beauty radiant and captivating.

Du Shanyin was momentarily entranced, while a young maid holding a bamboo basket stood beside the woman, her bright eyes sparkling. Seeing the young man in a daze, she couldn’t help but laugh even harder.

The sword immortal Executioner and the old deaf man nodded at each other.

Only then did the old deaf man lead the melancholy boy toward the grape trellis.

Under the trellis, cups of exquisite porcelain hung at various heights, seemingly awaiting the grapes to fall into them.

The twelve-colored flower god wine cups depicted twelve graceful women and inscribed with twelve corresponding poems.

The old deaf man said, "In the Righteous World, aside from the flower god women, there are actually twelve flower god men, all favored and celebrated by the blessed lands of flowers. Many are immortals and literary masters who, through fortuitous encounters, were inspired to write historically renowned poems for various flowers. A Liang once let slip that the birth of these ancient masterpieces wasn't just a stroke of genius; it also involved the flower god maidens’ influence—many enchanting nights spent under the flowers and moon, which can make one envious."

The young melancholy boy felt as if he were listening to a celestial tale.

Over at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the old deaf man occasionally ventured to the city’s battlements, feigning deafness and silence, only occasionally conversing with A Liang.

In reality, just by observing the inscriptions on the Zha Zha Tian stele, along with the old deaf man’s discussions with Chen Ping'an, it was clear that this ascended demon possessed profound knowledge.

A small white-haired boy, carrying a skeletal frame as white as jade, dashed across the creek bank.

The bones clattered against the ground.

Clearly, it was an immortal's lost husk, though it was uncertain where it had been unearthed.

The Executioner, shrouded in clouds, turned to glance at the external celestial demon.

The white-haired boy immediately halted, standing across the creek, grinning widely. "This is just a small gift for the two esteemed sons of heaven, a congratulatory gesture. Today I’ll deliver one, and tomorrow I’ll bring another."

The old deaf man chuckled.

The sword immortal remained silent.

The white-haired boy said earnestly, "I swear, as the grandson of the Hidden Official and the elder's grandson! I only wish to take a peek into your hearts and minds; if I make any sneaky moves, I’ll be struck by the heavens with five bolts of lightning."

He added with a tone of grievance, "I just want to see a few sights; it’s been so long since I’ve seen the wild world and the Sword Qi Great Wall."

The celestial demon turned to the two young men. "My surname is Wu, with 'Tian' as my character, and 'Die' as my name, meaning incessant chatter. This elder has no airs; you can just call me by my full name."

Both the old deaf man and the Executioner did not underestimate this celestial demon.

He was indeed an extremely bothersome neighbor.

The white-haired boy seemed intent on lingering, but the sword light flashed.

The white-haired boy dropped the skeletal frame and fled. Each time he coalesced into human form, the sword light would shatter him, and after dozens of times, he had to run over ten miles before the sword light ceased pursuing him.

Suspended in the wind, he felt deeply sorrowful.

Because a sword light, barely a foot long, hovered not far away.

This was the Executioner’s flying sword technique; if the sword immortal wished, the sword light could pursue the celestial demon for many years.

The white-haired boy raised his hands, "Alright, I’ll head home. I won’t bother you, I’m just going to find the Hidden Official."

He departed in a flash, appearing on the steps of the prison.

The sword light did not follow.

The "child" adorned with a green snake and a short sword walked slowly, failing to enter the hearts of the two young men, which left him greatly disappointed.

He viewed the memories of others as if reading through a book; the hazy memories were like rough sketches. The shallower the memory, the blurrier the image, while deeply ingrained memories were vividly colored, resembling real-life entities.

The celestial demon’s methods didn’t stop there; he also had a technique to manipulate memories. The higher a cultivator’s realm, the greater the celestial demon’s power, allowing him to freely alter and paint over the cherished images stored in one’s heart. He could make people forget certain things or suddenly remember others.

The lord of Bai Di City was feared by the mountain-top cultivators of the Righteous World precisely because he was proficient in this art.

However, that city lord had many more unreasonable methods. This celestial demon also longed to visit the Central Divine Continent to meet the city lord and discuss techniques.

But here in the cage, he could not escape.

Time to find some fun.

After all, Chen Qing had already promised him that as long as he didn’t directly attack that young man, he could borrow his power, and after testing him, he would still have two chances.

The white-haired boy had chosen two targets: a fox charm with mediocre charm skills and a lower Fifth Realm demon cultivator who was undoubtedly doomed.

The Hidden Official, after all, was a man, and by his attire, he also seemed to be a scholar.

Among life’s many desires, the most entangled was that of love, common to both men and women. Everyone had their obsessions, but the most binding was moral obligation, akin to chains, indistinguishable between gods and mortals.

That fox charm came from a den of foxes in the wild, but sadly had only seven tails and shallow cultivation.

The white-haired boy entered the cell holding the fox charm, and before she could sense anything unusual, he had already entered her heart's lake, freely flipping through her memories.

Moments later, he swaggered out of the fox charm’s body, only using an illusion technique. Shaking his head, he lamented, "How dreadful. No wonder that young man was unaffected."

The fox charm remained oblivious.

The white-haired boy muttered to himself, "Next time I see that Chen Ping'an, you should restore your true appearance, barefaced and tidy."

"I’ll help you craft a heart-wrenching, sincere story. For instance, you came to the Sword Qi Great Wall to meet a certain lover."

"Then I’ll gift you an additional technique, using the enchanting corpse method to cultivate the vibrant refinement technique, and secretly create a charming tent, giving you a fighting chance. You can only blame that boy for being too composed and his state of mind too peculiar."

No matter the material, the final form of the enchanting corpse’s life-bound object, whether it be a red veil, a bed, or a handkerchief, was referred to as a charming tent, also known as the land of tenderness.

The celestial demon casually occupied the heart of a seven-tailed fox charm and began to draw.

Suddenly, he burst into laughter.

In the realm of cultivation, did one’s fate truly belong to oneself?

Wasn’t that a bit too high an estimation of oneself?

After a fierce battle with a non-sword cultivator in the Yuan Ying realm, Chen Ping'an lay on the ground, gasping for breath, blood soaking his clothes.

Nianxin tossed him a porcelain vial, then busied herself nearby, saying, "Haste makes waste; starting from the Gold Dan is the right approach."

Chen Ping'an replied, "I need to find a place to settle down here, one that allows for quiet cultivation."

Nianxin said, "Then you should seek that celestial demon; he excels at turning the unreal into the real."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "If I can’t avoid it, I won’t run."

Nianxin continued to tidy up, saying, "We’ll start working soon. I’ll share some insights on the sewing techniques so you can be mentally prepared and avoid unnecessary hardships."

Chen Ping'an immediately sat up.

Nianxin explained, "The first task is to start from sculpting the eyeball. However, that sounds quite unpleasant, so let me tell you something lighter first."

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but smile bitterly but nodded anyway.

Nianxin slowly spoke, "According to the seamstress's rules, the human body is divided into three channels: mountains, water, and air. The bones represent the mountains, the blood represents the water, and the spirit energy merges with the soul to represent the air."

Chen Ping'an spoke solemnly, "I ask Senior Nianxin to elaborate in detail; the more meticulous and detailed, the better."

Being able to corroborate with Senior Li Er would greatly benefit his martial path.

The minutiae of the human body were filled with obstacles, much like a vast geographical map.

Nianxin recounted the details, speaking at length, then raised a hand, spreading her palm. The skin grew rapidly, soon resembling that of an ordinary person. "For example, the five fingers represent the mountains, and the lines on the palm represent water, intertwining and merging, forming the pattern of mountains and rivers. If you only look at the palm lines, they can also represent the entire universe within a hand, following its channels, the five organs and six intestines are clear at a glance. Otherwise, how could a practitioner perceive the mountains and rivers?"

Before Chen Ping'an could inquire about the techniques related to controlling mountains and rivers, a technique he had long desired, Nianxin shifted the topic. She had already raised her palm, fingers spread wide. "You can sew the true form of the Five Mountains, draw the Five Thunders’ orthodox cloud seals, write yellow talismans, refine the five elements, or compose divine decrees. Just with my fingers, I specialize in six different techniques. It is said that our seamstress ancestor was extraordinarily gifted, unmatched by anyone, and through the layered array techniques, fused various secret arts into one, turning clouds with a flip of the hand and controlling storms. Once, while facing the Dragon Tiger Mountain, just by using one palm, the power of the Five Thunders could darken the heavens."

Chen Ping'an tentatively said, "I once saw in a literary text that someone tattooed a few hundred verses from a great poet on their body. Isn’t that related to the seamstresses' techniques?"

Nianxin fell silent for a moment before replying, "That’s a sign of madness."

Chen Ping'an could only nod in agreement. "Indeed, I thought the same back then."

Nianxin continued to elaborate on various secret arts of the seamstresses.

Chen Ping'an took out the Sword Nourishing Gourd but did not drink.

Nianxin casually asked, "Why do men often enjoy drinking? Especially for cultivators, drinking can be detrimental to their progress."

"In the Sword Qi Great Wall, unlike our Righteous World, even if one breaks through, it doesn’t guarantee a long life. There are several Earth Immortal sword cultivators who sit by the roadside, drinking and eating pickled vegetables."

Such scenes would not exist in heaven and earth again.

Chen Ping'an hesitated, thinking of her in his heart, then smiled and said, "Women are like wine; there’s no need to drink."

Chen Ping'an leaned back, forgetting who had said it. When a young man likes a young woman, it is like tasting sweet rice wine; the flavor is not strong, but the first sip can indeed intoxicate. As he matures, a man liking a woman is akin to drinking strong liquor; a moment's carelessness can lead to heartbreak. In old age, a man reminiscing about a woman is like warming a pot of yellow wine in the dead of winter.

Nianxin turned her head and teased, "In the future, avoid saying such things to women."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Then I’ll change my ways."

After all, aside from Ning Yao, there were no romantic words to speak.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes. He knew that the sewing process in the prison could not be rushed, yet he ultimately wished to leave early.

At this moment, the celestial demon was locking eyes with a lower Fifth Realm demon cultivator.

Meanwhile, a great battle loomed at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The sun shone brightly upon the city walls.

The old priest gently patted the enormous cloud sea beneath him, which resembled the world’s largest mat, while waving at the suspended sun. "My merits are not yet complete, and my pockets are shallow. Truly, I am a poor priest, and all I can do is borrow some light."

The vast cloud sea scattered before coalescing into numerous golden divine beings, which the old priest swept down onto the battlefield with a wave of his sleeve.

In the line of confrontation, massive demon beasts revealed their true forms, crashing against the golden divine beings.

A monk clad in robes shook his shoulders, shedding a body of transformed lion insects that had become Buddhist scriptures.

The Confucian sage sat upright, the sun shining perfectly, suitable for reading.

The title of his book bore a life-bound word, establishing the doctrine and revolving around that life-bound word.

The attacking demons from the wild were countless.

On this day, Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged outside a prison.

Nianxin stood with her hands behind her, gazing into Chen Ping'an's eyes.

Her Yin God was carefully sculpting the young man's eyeball with embroidery needles.

This had already lasted for a tea's worth of time, causing small beads of blood to accumulate and trickle from the corners of his eyes.

Nianxin observed the mental state of the young man and casually remarked, "If you can’t withstand this trial, you might as well give up on sewing. Don’t close your eyes; if even a slight movement of the eyeball occurs, all your previous efforts will be in vain. You should weigh the consequences."

As long as he could endure, the seamstress possessed mysterious means to heal.

Moments later, Nianxin expressed mild surprise, saying, "Not bad; it seems we can do two things at once. The eyeball will be handled with the most basic techniques—yellow application and finishing—slowly inserting the needle, primarily inscribing clouds and seals. The inscriptions will be the shallowest. However, your spine will not be so easy; primarily, the knife techniques will be applied to your spine's joints, using the Nine Layer Seal, Bird Insect Seal, and Dripping Seal, each inscribed on your spine's joints. These are the techniques for peeling clothes, and more importantly, the techniques for wearing clothes. It’s still too early for that. If you think you can’t hold on, or if you believe you can wait a bit longer, now is the time to speak up and let me know."

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Nianxin approached Chen Ping'an from behind, her hands shaped like knives, slowly slicing through the green shirt and skin, pulling out a portion of his spine with extreme caution.

The girl curved her fingers, gently tapping, listening intently, and expressed regret, "You made me miscalculate; there are so many hidden injuries? Why didn’t any of this show up before?"

Nianxin casually returned the spine to its original position, her tone somewhat reproachful. "Let’s not apply any medicine for now; you need to adapt to this pain. Aren’t you able to endure it? Just take it well."

Chen Ping'an could only remain silent, struggling to maintain a state of intense focus and the "dead water state" with his soul, otherwise, he would have wanted to twist this woman's head off.

Inside the prison, a structure resembling a square space had suddenly appeared a few days ago, with only four pillars and no other coverings.

It resembled a small pavilion commonly found on earthly roads, yet not entirely.

Chen Ping'an walked barefoot inside, gradually slowing his pace.

Within, his vision was open, though he could see no scenery.

The white-haired boy of the green snake hung outside the structure, asking, "What’s wrong with you?"

Chen Ping'an continued walking, countering, "What do you mean?"

The white-haired boy shouted, "How can a cultivator’s mental state be so fragmented, like a battlefield?! It’s making things difficult for me at every turn…"

Chen Ping'an slowly punched the air, smiling and saying, "Where clarity exists, there are laws; where obscurity rests, there are spirits. Both clarity and obscurity are muddled, but conscience still exists in the heart. In the vast heavens and earth, the sun and moon shine brightly. What’s so strange about it?"

Nianxin stood at a distance, on the staircase, reminding him, "Let’s begin."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 791: Bearing the True Name

On the Upside-Down Mountain, the entire Plum Blossom Garden had vanished into thin air, turning into a tale of divine mystery that people spoke of with great interest. Then, one day, a large group of sword cultivators arrived from the Ape Ruler Manor, led by two sword immortals: the sociable Sun Juyuan and Mi Hu, who was rumored to have already reached the divine realm. They arrived on foot, but left in a flurry of carriages and boats, causing quite a stir both in the sky and on the ground. Yet, despite the sword cultivators’ grand display, the locals of the Upside-Down Mountain pretended not to notice, and the traveling outsiders dared not approach.

If they were separated from the Sword Qi Great Wall by thousands of mountains and rivers, which sword immortal would not dare to curse? But once they were up close with the sword cultivators, what could they do? They could only remain silent.

Only one wandering immortal, a register master who had traveled far, did not believe in omens. He secretly used his power to observe the mountains and rivers, and what he saw in the Ape Ruler Manor was a terrifying scene: pavilions and towers had been demolished beyond recognition. This old Nascent Soul cultivator from the White Cloud Continent sensed danger and was about to retract his palm and withdraw his divine power when a brilliant sword light suddenly appeared from the darkness, piercing through his palm. The sword light flashed again, stabbing through his left cheek and exiting through the right, vanishing as quickly as it had come, the flying sword returning to the Ape Ruler Manor.

In pain, the old cultivator understood: his eyes should not see, and his mouth should not speak.

Having suffered such a heavy loss without a voice, it was only natural for him to harbor resentment against the sword immortal’s tyrannical actions. In his homeland, how could a dignified Nascent Soul suffer such humiliation?!

The sword cultivators had emptied the Liu family's Ape Ruler Manor in the White Cloud Continent and returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall that very night. Meanwhile, the bustling Mirage City, a trade hub of the Sword Qi Great Wall, gradually fell into decline over the following months. Shops were continuously relocating, gradually moving to the Upside-Down Mountain. If one had no ancestral place to settle in the Upside-Down Mountain, they could only return to their respective sects across the vast world, since land there was incredibly valuable. Moreover, with the Sword Qi Great Wall now serving as a boundary, everything to the south was a forbidden area, having long since been sealed off by a grand mountain and water formation, obscured from view. Thus, the towering city of the Sword Qi Great Wall was no longer a place to explore, making business on the Upside-Down Mountain increasingly bleak. Now, ferries traveling between the Upside-Down Mountain and the eight continents saw very few visitors; they were carrying more cargo than passengers. Consequently, many intercontinental ferries were now heavily loaded, like the ferry from Old Dragon City to Osmanthus Island, which had completely submerged its original dock under water. Many ferries that used to swiftly traverse clouds and rain had also slowed down considerably.

The war was intense, and the situation was perilous. This siege by the barbaric world was unusual, and the Upside-Down Mountain was keenly aware of this. However, historically, the Sword Qi Great Wall had entered closed-door cultivation more than once or twice; it wasn't enough to incite widespread panic. Many register masters had previously sold their property and shops at low prices during the great closures of the Sword Qi Great Wall, only to regret their decisions deeply afterward.

Among the four private residences on the Upside-Down Mountain was the Water Spirit Palace, presided over by a female cultivator of the Jade Purity realm named Yun Qian. She was one of the founders of the Rain Dragon Sect. One of her most favored disciples had taken a liking to a down-and-out wild cultivator named Fu Ke, who, due to a fortuitous encounter, was rapidly breaking through and became a remarkable figure in the Rain Dragon Sect's history of talented individuals.

Yun Qian was concerned not only for the future of her own sect but also for the war involving the Sword Qi Great Wall. After all, the Water Spirit Palace was unlike the Spring Banner Studio or the Plum Blossom Garden; it had not been refined and could not be relocated. It was also not like the Liu family’s Ape Ruler Manor, a treasure worth its weight in gold, which was merely optional to possess.

Yet now, the Sword Qi Great Wall was on high alert, especially with the current authorities belonging to the Hidden Officials faction, known for their meticulous and ruthless methods. Any cultivator who broke the rules, whether intentionally or not, was doomed to face dire consequences. Several individuals had previously sought out the Water Spirit Palace, all of whom had some connection to the Rain Dragon Sect. Two were Nascent Soul cultivators, and one was an old immortal from the Talisman Sect at the Jade Purity realm, all hoping that she could help mediate a bit with the Celestial Lord of the Upside-Down Mountain or plead for leniency from a sword immortal familiar with her. However, the Celestial Lord had long entered closed-door cultivation. Yun Qian attempted to visit a secluded peak to find the old immortal who had refined the dragon to forge a dust-raising immortal weapon, but she was met with a cold reception. When she tried to send a message to the sword immortal Sun Juyuan, with whom she had maintained good relations over the years, that letter disappeared without a trace, as if Sun Juyuan had never received it.

Feeling unsettled in the Water Spirit Palace, Yun Qian could no longer focus on her cultivation. She hurried to the Rain Dragon Sect's Ancestor Hall to convene a meeting and proposed relocating the sect, only to be met with ridicule. Although Yun Qian had prepared for this, understanding that it was no easy matter and perhaps quite far-fetched, seeing the Ancestor Hall members shift their conversation to various business dealings made her feel disheartened.

As the sword cultivators departed from the Ape Ruler Manor, a message-carrying flying sword from the Spring Banner Studio quietly arrived at the Water Spirit Palace.

Upon opening the secret letter, Yun Qian found only two words written on the paper.

**Northward Migration.**

The letter bore the signature of the sword immortal Sun Juyuan, which she recognized very well. It also featured two ancient seal characters, "Hidden Officials." Yun Qian had heard of them for a long time but was seeing them for the first time. 

With "Hidden Officials" inscribed above and the sword immortal's signature below, it adhered to the proper protocols. It should not be a forgery.

Yun Qian did not dare to linger and quietly left the Upside-Down Mountain, hastening back to the Rain Dragon Sect, where she was only able to find her senior sister, the sect leader. To her surprise, her senior sister casually tossed aside the letter, scoffing, "What? After dismantling the Ape Ruler Manor, you want to tear down the Water Spirit Palace too? The young Hidden Official is certainly calculating well. Yun Qian, do you believe if you go to the Spring Banner Studio, where Shao Yunyan is now a trusted confidant of the Hidden Official, he’ll discuss the Water Spirit Palace with you?"

Yun Qian was skeptical but did not forget to carefully tuck the letter away in her sleeve.

Seeing her actions, the sect leader grew even more furious and emphasized, "Now, our Rain Dragon Sect's ancestral estate has not come easily; you and I both know the hardships involved. Yun Qian, neither of us has made any achievements in expanding our territory. Now, are we unable even to hold onto what we have? Have you forgotten why you were demoted to the Water Spirit Palace? Those Nascent Soul worshippers dare to point fingers at you, not because you angered everyone in the Ancestor Hall, but because you couldn't even handle that small Luohua Island. If you lose the Water Spirit Palace now, how will you face the ancestors of the Rain Dragon Sect? Do you know what everyone says behind your back? A woman's kindness! A Jade Purity realm immortal, do you think this is acceptable?"

The sect leader did not want to demean her junior sister too much, knowing that the Water Spirit Palace needed Yun Qian's leadership. If Yun Qian were to get angry and randomly concoct an excuse to venture out to visit immortals or travel to Tongye Continent for leisure, the sect leader would not be able to stop her. Thus, she softened her tone, saying, "And don't forget, we made a deal with the founding ancestor of the Water Cave in the Fuyun Continent. That old account has been recorded by the Sword Qi Great Wall. The new Hidden Official holds great power, and what about that vast Water Cave in the Fuyun Continent? Is the Ancestor Hall still intact? Yun Qian, are you trying to lead our Rain Dragon Sect to follow in their footsteps? This Hidden Official has a hidden agenda and is not to be underestimated, especially skilled at using influence to pressure others."

Yun Qian nodded lightly in acknowledgment.

The sect leader pressed her point further, "Yun Qian, I’ll say this just once more: the Sword Qi Great Wall has a grudge against our Rain Dragon Sect. Does the new Hidden Official have any old ties with you? Why would he plan an escape route for our sect? Is it really about repaying kindness with kindness? Yun Qian, I’ve said all I can; think carefully!"

Yun Qian left the Rain Dragon Sect in silence and returned to the Water Spirit Palace. She had indeed taken her senior sister's words to heart. The intrigue among the register masters on the mountain left her feeling apprehensive. Throughout her journey in cultivation, she had suffered greatly from such betrayal, having faced three major calamities in her life. Aside from a natural disaster, the rest were man-made, all stemming from those around her. Yet, she remained unconvinced and visited the Spring Banner Studio. The sword immortal Shao Yunyan seemed to have anticipated her visit and handed her another secret letter, stating that the Hidden Official had reviewed the Rain Dragon Sect's records and greatly admired her kindness.

Yun Qian furrowed her brow. Shao Yunyan smiled and added that the Hidden Official did not expect her to believe his suggestion, but he urged her to read the letter and then dispose of it. Otherwise, it could lead to unforeseen complications, which would not be good for either the Hidden Official or Yun Qian herself.

Upon returning to the Water Spirit Palace, Yun Qian spent a sleepless night contemplating the detailed content of the letter. At the end of the letter were eight words: "Sect divided north and south, firewood in Qing Mountain."

Meanwhile, at the Spring Banner Studio, after Yun Qian left, Mi Yu and Nalan Caihuan appeared simultaneously. Mi Yu asked with a smile, "Brother Shao, do you think Yun Qian will really migrate north? If she has the courage and means, how many disciples from the Rain Dragon Sect could she save?"

Shao Yunyan replied, "In sects with the word 'sect' in their name, people are often grouped together. Yun Qian has become accustomed to business dealings in the Rain Dragon Sect and is not very popular, so even if she is willing to relocate, she wouldn’t take many people with her."

Mi Yu remarked, "What Yun Qian can't take, she shouldn’t need to take at all."

Nalan Caihuan's expression soured. "How dare you speak of Yun Qian's kindness! Do you believe that if Yun Qian really migrates north and the Rain Dragon Sect splits, the southern immortals who escape will not harbor resentment towards the Sword Qi Great Wall for their indifference? Especially our kind-hearted Hidden Official! If Yun Qian accidentally reveals the contents of the two letters, she could provoke enmity."

Shao Yunyan nodded, "So, asking Yun Qian to destroy the letter is likely because he is aware of this fickleness in human nature. I believe Yun Qian, when focused on her cultivation, should be able to recognize the implications of these gains and losses."

Mi Yu chuckled, "But what if Yun Qian doesn’t realize? Will our Hidden Official care about that?"

Shao Yunyan sighed, "It seems that the Rain Dragon Sect, which believes that everything in the world is simply a transaction, has not only one or two individuals in the Ancestor Hall harboring thoughts of becoming a dragon’s aide, still thinking it’s merely a business deal."

Nalan Caihuan snorted coldly, "Without the wisdom of the Hidden Official, who dares to speak of business under such circumstances?!"

Realizing her slip of the tongue, the woman left in haste to continue her calculations.

Shao Yunyan and Mi Yu exchanged smiles.

At the ferry dock on the Upside-Down Mountain, a cross-continental ferry from North Julu Continent had just arrived with sixty-two sword cultivators, who were taciturn and headed straight for the gate, making their way to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In a seemingly floating pavilion, Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged on the floor, supporting his fists on his knees, breathing deeply. The object he was sitting on was the bamboo mat he had picked up from the Plum Blossom Garden. It not only helped cultivators focus and calm their minds but also had remarkable uses, allowing Chen Ping'an to refine the abundant green water pearls more quickly. Additionally, perhaps due to the bamboo mat’s material, in addition to benefiting the Water Mansion, the wooden residence was also significantly aided. The water pearls he refined, with excess water spiritual energy, could be drawn toward the wooden residence's Qi Mansion, a continuous flow of water energy that nourished his internal organs.

In the mountain, while such immortal artifacts might not be of high grade, they were indispensable. Little by little, over the course of a few years, the results might not be immediately apparent, but once one dedicated themselves to cultivation, spending decades or even centuries in the mountains, the transformation would be monumental. Thus, the register masters of the large sects, as Lu Tai mentioned, must possess a similar life-enhancing item. If the immortal’s resources were sufficient, they would seek, beyond their life-enhancing items, something that would ensure a long-lasting future, like building a skyscraper from the ground up.

Depending on different times, different immortal caves, and corresponding cultivation realms, one must constantly switch items, as there were many details to consider.

A foreign celestial demon drifted around the building without uttering a word, seemingly more worthy of investigation than the young sword immortal obscured by clouds.

The young Hidden Official had just returned from a secret realm; otherwise, he would not be so relaxed. Previously, he had been dragged by that thorny entity to a place where the remains of an ancient deity were refined into a realm. Located in the heart of that area was a forbidden zone where the old deaf man, the foreign celestial demon, and the seamstress could not enter. There was a small door symbolically locked, and only the old deaf man could extract the key and pass through, allowing the thorny entity to cast the young Hidden Official inside.

Inside was a golden pond bubbling with magma, and the inner chamber was blindingly bright with golden light. 

Every time Chen Ping'an was thrown into the golden magma by the seamstress, he would emerge after just a few hours, completely restored and healed. 

Yet, he had to leave behind his sword nurturing gourd in the floating pavilion.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Do ancient deities also have Qi Mansion openings, similar to our human structure?"

The white-haired boy paused, "Generally similar, but your human race is ultimately not as closely knit with the heavens and earth as the deities, after all, they crafted these puppets themselves. What they seek is merely incense offerings. Your human bodies, as small worlds, naturally won't be too exquisite from birth; however, compared to other beings, you are already quite fortunate. Otherwise, why do mountain spirits, ghosts, and the demon race of the barbaric world tirelessly strive to transform into human forms?"

Chen Ping'an caught a key phrase, "Close-knit? Is there some relation to the Daoist pursuit of purity?"

The foreign celestial demon spun slowly, answering indirectly, "Sword cultivators wield flying swords that can break myriad laws. A common kitchen knife can chop vegetables and firewood. But what exactly did the flying sword break? What did the kitchen knife cleave through? Do you understand the profound truth behind it?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

His student, Cui Dongshan, might understand the underlying reasons better.

Chen Ping'an finally opened his eyes and asked, "In exchange, I promised you that you could enter my heart lake three times. What did you see during those visits?"

The white-haired boy, who was the Er Qing Snake, sat cross-legged and suddenly flew into a rage, gritting his teeth but refusing to speak.

Having done four trades with this person, helping to construct buildings and gifting a set of a female sword immortal's shed skin, plus two short swords, he felt he had been taken advantage of.

Curious, Chen Ping'an picked up the nurturing gourd and took out one of the short swords. "If you’re willing to speak, I’ll return the short sword to you."

Inside the nurturing gourd was also the sword immortal from the Ascendant Sect's life sword "Tianlai," being nurtured.

The white-haired boy reached out, snatching the short sword from Chen Ping'an's hand and securing it at his waist. One sword remained, still being nurtured in that low-grade nurturing gourd, and he said, "The first time I visited, I met a middle-aged Taoist who wanted to spar with me. I nearly got scared to death."

"The second time, I didn’t go to that shabby little residence, but I encountered a youth with a weary appearance, wearing straw sandals and carrying a kitchen knife, wandering around. When we crossed paths, he wanted to discuss Buddhism with me, and just as he said 'please sit,' I was frightened again."

After recounting the two visits, the white-haired boy fell silent for some reason.

Chen Ping'an asked, "What happened the last time?"

The white-haired boy retorted, "Do you just love discussing principles?"

Chen Ping'an was confused. "What do you mean?"

The white-haired boy jumped up and cursed, "There was a guy who spoke to me for what felt like several years, based on the different speeds of time flowing in the river of light, and he wouldn’t let me leave! I truly couldn’t escape!"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "So I’m that annoying, even a foreign celestial demon can’t stand me?"

The white-haired boy cast a meaningful glance at the four pillars supporting the building.

After that, Chen Ping'an continued his cultivation, and the foreign celestial demon continued to wander, both remaining silent.

On this day, Chen Ping'an removed his upper garments, exposing his back.

The thorny entity casually withdrew a spine and began skinning it, stitching it up while inscribing several ancient seal characters, including the Nine Folding Seal, onto the young man's spine and skin, engraving one "true name" after another. Each name belonged to a mighty demon that had perished under the sword immortal’s blade, all intricately connected to the ancient ferocious beings now imprisoned in the cage. The closer the relationship, the greater the causality, and naturally, the better the stitching effect. Of course, the suffering endured by the young man would also escalate.

To prevent the young Hidden Official from being overwhelmed, collapsing his Dao heart, and his flesh and blood dissolving, leading to failure, the thorny entity had to impart a secret technique to Chen Ping'an that would allow him to slightly divert his focus.

This was truly a last resort. After all, Chen Ping'an had not yet reached the realm of wandering, and even after the tempering in that golden magma, his martial body could not bear too many true names of great demons. The thorny entity could only inscribe three each time—already the limit.

The young man had only one hand left to control; in fact, during the later stages of stitching, after the thorny entity inscribed the second great demon's true name, Chen Ping'an couldn't even dare to entertain a single thought. Even without any mental support, he still found his fingers writing in the air repeatedly: "Ning Yao, Ning Yao..."

The thorny entity, confined in the prison, never inquired about the matters of the Sword Qi Great Wall, so he did not know who this Ning Yao was.

During occasional breaks, the thorny entity would sneak a glance at the young man's writing, curious about which woman could inspire such affection in him. But was it really that deep?

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 792: Finally Entering the Realm of Far Travel**

Among the sixty-one demon races imprisoned here, only a few remained. Today, the work of sewing the thread was particularly crucial, marking the final stages at the spine.

Old Hearing stood with his hands behind his back, having hurried over to observe the sewing. As a demon, he found it far more comforting to watch others endure suffering than to see them enjoy themselves. The white-haired boy beside him called out to his grandson, and Old Hearing responded with a nod, pretending to be deaf.

Chen Ping'an had already settled into a meditative state, his mind deeply immersed. Every part of his being felt as if it were pinned down by an embroidery needle, tightly bound by the thread to prevent him from succumbing to pain and ruining the critical sewing process, which relied on an intricate chain of events that could not afford even the slightest error.

Nianxin, the seamstress, was pouring her heart into this sewing, essentially crafting a wedding gown for the young Hidden Official. The reasoning was simple: such an opportunity to practice her skills would never come again in her lifetime. Moreover, once successful, at least two realms of Qi cultivators—especially those hypocritical sect leaders and immortal teachers—would come to know her as Nianxin, the seamstress who had accomplished an unprecedented feat.

Just as discussions around chess invariably led to mentions of Baidi City, so too would discussions of Dao inevitably circle back to the Taishi. Thus, Nianxin was even more eager for success than Chen Ping'an.

After a prolonged period of cutting and stitching, she often found her eyes feeling dry and sore. To alleviate the strain, she picked up a nearby sword-raising gourd, poured out a dense, verdant pearl, tilted her head back, and let the drops land in her eyes.

In addition to the sword-raising gourd borrowed from the young Hidden Official, after two rounds of sewing, Nianxin took out two treasured artifacts—namely, a golden talisman and a jade book. 

Old Hearing looked down at the golden talisman and jade book, nodding in approval. "Good stuff," he remarked.

The white-haired boy lamented, "What a pity. Once used, they'll become useless. Otherwise, my grandfather, the Hidden Official, would surely have his eyes shining with delight."

Both artifacts were tied to Nianxin's Dao connections. She had once confided in Chen Ping'an that her path of cultivation relied not only on the secret arts and mystical powers of a seamstress but also on the golden talisman and jade book, both of which were highly orthodox treasures of the immortals, complementing her sewing technique. Without them, she would not have survived to this day.

Ordinary cultivators, even those at the same Jade Purity level as Nianxin, could not decipher the contents of the golden talisman and jade book, as if they were trapped within a natural mountain and water formation. However, Old Hearing and the white-haired boy were anything but ordinary.

The jade book was a sacred tome from an ancient dynasty in the Central Land, consisting of twenty-four bamboo slips connected by golden threads. Each slip had been meticulously polished by secret techniques. The golden talisman was a volume of the "True Scroll of Talismans," also known as the "Talisman Assignment Diagram," divided into three parts. The first part comprised sixteen grand characters—eight characters at the front from the three cave gold texts of true immortal slips, written in cloud script, swirling like mist. The latter eight characters represented the eternal Dao and were blessing words penned by a great Master of Dragon Tiger Mountain. The second part depicted portraits of sixty-one immortals, while the third part contained the main text of the entire "True Scroll of Talismans," recounting the tale of a queen who aspired to become a transcendent Daoist immortal. It was said that after the dynasty's downfall, she devoted herself to cultivation and eventually ascended.

The jade book was manageable, merely a foot in size when laid out. However, the true scroll, when unfurled, extended over ten feet long.

The reason Nianxin took out these two treasures was that using her unique sewing techniques, she could extract text, peel off charms, or imprint cloud patterns, and then reinforce them onto the young Hidden Official's skin and bones with the yellow paper method.

Thus, it could be said that Nianxin had reached a point where she was willing to risk everything for this sewing.

As for the suffering and calamities the young man would endure, Nianxin was entirely indifferent. Since he dared to come here and undertake this task, he should be prepared to accept it.

At that moment, glancing at the golden talisman and jade book on the ground, Old Hearing suddenly remembered a small matter. Earlier, he had promised the young Hidden Official a deal to ensure the safe exit of his three disciples from prison.

The terms had been settled; Old Hearing needed to provide a Dao technique suitable for demon clan cultivation, along with two rare artifacts with low thresholds for both refining and use.

Giving away two artifacts was a minor issue, but finding an appropriate Dao technique posed some challenges.

A methodical mountain Dao technique would undoubtedly come with numerous restrictions, much like certain rare charms that had specific methods for opening and closing.

For example, a certain ancestral talisman from the Dragon Tiger Mountain Master’s estate had been enhanced by successive generations of masters. Even for those not of the master’s lineage, unless they were immortal realm cultivators, it would be impossible to even lift it.

The profound arts of the immortals, often recorded in secret texts, naturally aligned with the great Dao. Once compiled into written form, they contained inherent mysteries. First, the materials used to inscribe the Daoist texts were not ordinary. Second, even if great cultivators lifted various restrictions, lower-tier Qi cultivators would still be incapable of deciphering them. Thus, sect families often treasured their Dao texts, with much of the knowledge transmitted orally, referred to as "intimate teaching."

Moreover, the oral teachings by a preacher were no easy task. A single misstep could ruin a disciple's Dao heart.

After some thought, Old Hearing decided that keeping that Dao text for himself would serve no purpose since he had no intention of establishing a sect. Instead, he would remove all restrictions and give it to the young Hidden Official. After that, how Chen Ping'an taught others was no concern of his. Handing out toilet paper to someone squatting in the restroom was already quite a gesture; after all, one couldn't wipe their backside as well.

The white-haired boy chuckled and asked, "If it were You Yu and Du Shanyin, would they be rolling all over the ground after just one cut?"

Old Hearing shook his head. "If they could manage to endure two cuts, they still have a chance. After all, those two kids don’t rely on suffering to cultivate; their luck is better than anything else. Otherwise, they wouldn't have the chance to enjoy themselves here."

Nianxin set down her knife and took a moment to rest. Having felt slightly sluggish earlier, her mood appeared to have soured. Hearing the noise from Old Hearing and the outlandish demon, she frowned and snapped, "Get lost!"

Known for his good temper at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Old Hearing indeed moved away, climbing the steps. "It’s one thing to be ugly, but a bad temper? No wonder she can't get married."

The white-haired boy floated beside Old Hearing and asked, "Does You Yu's Dao heart need your help to sharpen? You don't need to thank me for such a small favor."

Old Hearing chuckled, "I advise you not to. The Great Sword Immortal is watching this way. If I fail to protect my master, before I get crushed, I’ll surely settle accounts with you—both old and new debts."

After those two left, Nianxin exhaled a breath of frustration and continued to focus, gently bringing her knife down.

What appeared to be a horrific sight to ordinary mortals was, in her eyes, a masterpiece. The method of engraving was delicate; the Yang script prized clarity and lightness. After carving the inscription, mist swirled upward, producing five-colored auspicious fungi, while the Yin script favored richness and heaviness, resembling the long, winding dragon veins at the foot of the Great Mountain. Clarity resembled the heavens, while heaviness represented the earth.

For instance, using four-character Yang script cloud seals, she inscribed not the true names of the great demons but the法印 (fa yin) of the "Dao Sutra Master’s Treasures." Once the seal was completed, auspicious phenomena emerged, lingering like clouds around a mountain.

She also engraved the eight ancient small seals of "Taiyi Zhuangbao" and "List of Immortals," requiring extreme precision, stacking each character with utmost care, consuming Nianxin's heart and spirit.

The knife techniques, the talisman patterns, twisted and intertwined to the utmost. When she sheathed her knife, the pen held like a droplet of dew, hanging low yet not falling, as if water droplets condensed from morning mist.

There were also cutting techniques that resembled a carpenter's woodworking shavings. Nianxin lowered her head and gently blew away any useless shavings, all of which came from the young Hidden Official's spine.

After wrapping up for the day, Nianxin dragged the young man to a small door, complaining, "Chen Ping'an, you can barely withstand this; it's only about thirty cuts at most. If I hadn't stopped in time, your entire spine would have been ruined. Do you want to break the Bridge of Eternal Life again?!"

The barely conscious young man couldn't utter a word, merely moving his lips, likely cursing.

Blood was splattered everywhere, not a drop wasted. The blood would naturally weave into threads, eventually being collected into the embroidered pouch at her waist.

Old Hearing stood by the small door, unlocked it, and Nianxin tossed the young Hidden Official into the golden magma-filled "furnace" inside the room.

Old Hearing shut the door.

Just as Nianxin was about to leave, Old Hearing spoke up, "How did the Hidden Official manage to kill at the fifth realm? The Great Sword Immortal didn't mention it; how do you plan to resolve this?"

Nianxin shook her head. "He didn't say."

Old Hearing laughed. "Was today smooth sailing?"

Nianxin's brow furrowed, "Chen Ping'an still hasn't entered the Realm of Far Travel; this isn't a long-term solution. The pain he's enduring is quite severe, and he bears three parts of it himself. If I were in his position, I'd have asked the Great Sword Immortal to use some unconventional methods to break through first. Since he's so eager to leave, why not be in a greater rush?"

Old Hearing nodded. These troubling matters had nothing to do with him. "Miss Nianxin, having been neighbors for so many years, how about I treat you to a meal of mudfish stew? My young master is truly skilled in cooking. It's better than your internal organs chewing on each other."

Nianxin brushed him off and floated away.

Old Hearing went to the cage of the Great Demon Qing Qiu. Without needing to say a word, the Great Demon obediently offered three drops of its life essence and a large piece of flesh, tremblingly asking, "Could you please convey a message to the Hidden Official?"

At this rate, it was becoming unbearable.

Old Hearing chewed on the raw flesh of the blue catfish, which was very chewy but lacked the flavor of cooked food. He chuckled, "Didn't the Hidden Official come to see you again? How come you still couldn't reach an agreement last time?"

The Great Demon Qing Qiu's smile was bitter.

Earlier, it had indeed met with the young man again, but at that moment, it had nearly yanked the fellow into the prison again and "politely" declined the offer.

The young man had mentioned that catfish were fond of dark, murky waters and were most afraid of sunlight. Then he tossed a piece of yellow paper talisman resembling a ghostly drawing into the cage. The Great Demon Qing Qiu snatched it up and mocked the young man's talisman technique.

After that, the young man stopped visiting, while Old Hearing came by every few days.

Old Hearing had cleaned out the cage, hands behind his back. "What took you so long?"

Perhaps today was a fortunate day for the Great Demon Qing Qiu; Chen Ping'an strolled through the prison of the fifth realm Great Demons.

As the young man passed, the Great Demon Qing Qiu appeared near the sword light fence and asked, "How can I prevent Cheng Shan from causing me trouble?"

Chen Ping'an froze for a moment; Cheng Shan was the alias Old Hearing used in the wild lands. The summer resort’s file on Old Hearing consisted of two pages, each word smeared into ink blocks by the previous Hidden Official, Xiao Xian, who had carefully blotted each character without tearing the pages or carelessly smearing large areas, as if she was engaged in a very interesting task.

Chen Ping'an paused, locking eyes with the Great Demon Qing Qiu. "It's simple. Tell me all the inside info about the great demon who fell into the Yeluo River; the more detailed, the better."

The Great Demon Qing Qiu remained silent for a moment, a mocking smile crossing its face, and retreated back into the mist barrier.

Chen Ping'an did not press further and went to the first cage where Yun Qing was held. He often visited this place to chat with the Great Demon, and it was genuinely just idle talk about the customs and flavors of their respective worlds.

Today, they sat facing each other, separated only by a fence.

Chen Ping'an had not expected Yun Qing to be well-versed in knowledge, rivaling even the scholars of the Confucian school. For instance, when discussing the "Monthly Ordinance," she had unique insights, particularly about the phrase stating that in autumn, one should hunt the giant flood dragon, which implied that the flood dragon could be hunted while the dragon could not.

After inquiring, Chen Ping'an learned that Yun Qing had spent several years studying in Zhou Mi's territory, though they had no official teacher-student relationship.

Moreover, Yun Qing enjoyed wandering the world, traveling to various places, and had even compiled a poetry collection that was widely circulated in several dynasties of the wild lands.

At the end of their idle chat, the Great Demon Yun Qing smiled and took out a bamboo flute from her waist, inscribed with the words "Fallen Celestial," holding it in her hand. "This semi-immortal weapon is useless to keep, so I present it to the Hidden Official."

The flute, inscribed with the words "Fallen Celestial," also bore a line of smaller characters indicating it had once been gifted to Lu Zhi Feng Xuan. 

Yun Qing explained that this item had been a token of love for a great demon who had ascended. If it weren't for the severe damage rendering it unreparable, it would have been a genuine celestial weapon.

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I can't accept it."

Yun Qing was puzzled. "Why not?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Even if we meet with affinity, we ultimately belong to different factions. It wouldn't be appropriate for you to kill me later."

Yun Qing nodded and smiled. "Likewise, that's why we resonate."

Within the suspended building, Chen Ping'an walked in circles, unconsciously hunching his back, one arm hanging limply by his side.

Nianxin sat on the distant steps and said, "If you don't enter the Realm of Far Travel soon, the aftereffects will be significant. Even if you eventually succeed, the results will be greatly diminished."

Chen Ping'an nodded gently. "I know."

Nianxin felt helpless.

The white-haired boy appeared beside Nianxin, morphing into the scholarly form of Great Demon Yun Qing, smiling as he said, "Miss Nianxin, I must confess I've harbored feelings for you for a long time. What a captivating beauty, free from earthly constraints, unlike any rich adornment in the mortal world."

Nianxin ignored him.

The outlandish demon shifted forms again, raspy-voiced, "Nianxin, would you really mind that I'm deaf, blind, and old?"

Nianxin continued to disregard him.

The outlandish demon transformed once more, "Miss Nianxin, one cannot judge a person by their appearance. In my eyes, you are a beautiful lady. Among countless attractive women, there's only one Nianxin."

Chen Ping'an, still practicing his stance, said, "That's enough."

It turned out the outlandish demon had taken on Chen Ping'an's appearance in a blue robe.

Nianxin was focused solely on the follow-up to her sewing.

The outlandish demon resumed its favorite form and sat on the steps, "A lone man and a solitary woman, without a hint of affection—how absurd! What’s going on between you two? Such a dampener on the mood."

After finishing his stance, Chen Ping'an began holding his sword to practice, breathing and calming himself to nurture his life sword.

Nianxin left.

The outlandish demon, unwilling to depart, fixed its gaze on the sword-raising gourd beside Chen Ping'an. 

His short sword, "Dragon Qiu," was inside it, while the sword he had returned was now at his waist, named "Jiang Du." 

Both held significant origins, perfect for nurturing the two little things dangling by his ears.

In fact, anything that could long endure in this world would not be of low quality.

However, for an outlandish demon, it held little meaning—it was all about the eye affinity.

Suddenly, it exclaimed, "What about that celestial shed skin? How about I just give you my robe too, let her dress up and wield her sword?"

Chen Ping'an replied indifferently, "The deceased take precedence."

After rising, he leaned back, supported himself with one hand, closed his eyes, and pinched his sword formula with the other.

The white-haired boy kept his promise, not intruding into that building, but instead wandered around, constantly transforming into various demons that had perished under Chen Ping'an's fists and swords. He only asked, "The deceased take precedence? What of the living?"

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, aligning his fingers against the ground, slightly elevating his feet.

The now-reverted white-haired boy smiled at him, saying, "Your heart and mind are not in sync. You’ve been too hard on yourself—the strong are one with heaven and earth."

Chen Ping'an shut his eyes again, stating, "There are no fixed laws."

The outlandish demon suddenly transformed into a woman, smiling sweetly.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, then opened his eyes to find a face that could easily deceive anyone.

What he thought was reflected in what he saw.

This was the terrifying aspect of the outlandish demon.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes again and said, "Bear the consequences yourself."

The white-haired boy immediately shouted, "Hidden Official, what if your future inner demons take the form of this lady? What then?"

Chen Ping'an chuckled softly and replied, "I would actually welcome that."

The white-haired boy raised his hands and lightly flicked his fingers beside the blue snake, making a subtle sound that echoed through the heavens. He asked, "Shall we put on a performance?"

Chen Ping'an spoke sternly, "Get lost!"

The white-haired boy complained, "I lost a level for no reason; this deal with the Hidden Official is certainly a loss."

In the next moment, the outlandish demon fell silent, shrinking its neck.

It turned out Chen Qingdu had already caught hold of its head, lifting it up.

The elder was merely using his sword intent to overpower it, causing the outlandish demon's face to twist in pain, its whole body melting away like a wax candle, its features unrecognizable, and it immediately wailed, desperately pleading for mercy.

Chen Ping'an spun around, standing elegantly.

Chen Qingdu tossed the outlandish demon far away, looking at Chen Ping'an and frowning. "You didn't carve out a single true name of the key great demons?"

Nianxin appeared again on the steps, "Don't blame me; I can carve, but it would have to be on the dead."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "The martial artist's bottleneck is truly difficult to break. Even when confronting the outlandish demon in a contest of fists, it yields no results. What I lack now is that mysterious divine intent. Otherwise, just enduring Nianxin's sewing would be enough for me to enter the Realm of Far Travel."

Chen Qingdu said, "Where do I find a complete tenth realm martial artist for the Hidden Official?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Don't ask me."

Chen Qingdu was slightly annoyed but also amused.

The white-haired boy was wide-eyed in amazement.

With Old Hearing's arrival, he was utterly impressed.

The outlandish demon curled up on the steps felt that the repeated calls for the Hidden Official had not been in vain.

As a result, the Hidden Official was overpowered by the sword intent, first bending at the waist, then kneeling, finally collapsing onto the ground, nearly becoming a puddle of mud.

Fortunately, the Great Sword Immortal was somewhat honorable, directly tossing Chen Ping'an into the magma furnace.

Once Chen Ping'an disappeared, Chen Qingdu waved his hand, and Nianxin's group simultaneously left.

The elder stood within the pavilion, surveying the surroundings, his gaze slowly sweeping over the four pillars of the pavilion.

Chen Ping'an had rarely left the prison, taking the opportunity to breathe some fresh air.

The white-haired boy soon appeared, urging the young Hidden Official to visit the place where the execution officer cultivated, saying that there were many treasures there—unclaimed items to be found.

Just looking was free, and if one could gather, it was even better.

Under the guidance of the outlandish demon, Chen Ping'an arrived at a stream, feeling somewhat dazed, as if he were back in his hometown, ready to gather snake gallstones, though he lacked a large basket.

The white-haired boy was like a gossiping spirit, detailing the recent circumstances of two master-servant pairs, saying that You Yu was a bit slow-witted and could not compare to the three disciples Old Hearing had taken in. However, Du Shanyin had decent sword talent and good fortune but was a considerable lecher. All these characters could become the masters of Old Hearing and the execution officer, and he genuinely felt for the Hidden Official.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an stopped in his tracks; not far from the stream, he spotted two women—one pounding clothes and the other washing silk.

He gazed intently, filled with disbelief. Having roamed the rivers and lakes, he had encountered those who lived by incense and offerings, even seen Cui Dongshan's insect silver, yet he had never seen the two women before him.

The white-haired boy exclaimed, "The Hidden Official has truly good eyes, instantly recognizing their true identities as the ancestral incarnations of Jin Jing Qian and Gu Yu Qian. Du Shanyin couldn't possibly see beyond their pretty faces, ample bosoms, and slim waists. Poor You Yu didn't even dare to take a good look; only the Hidden Official is truly remarkable."

The clothes-pounding woman looked up, brushing back her hair, and smiled faintly at Chen Ping'an.

The silk-washing girl noticed the young Hidden Official and rested a finger on her cheek.

Chen Ping'an returned the gesture with a fist salute.

The white-haired boy stomped his feet. "Hidden Official, they don't deserve your great courtesy; it would embarrass them."

Chen Ping'an pretended not to hear and walked toward the thatched cottage, pondering over matters of wealth.

The golden copper coins had three types in the Great Li: the Welcome Spring Coin, the Offering Coin, and the Suppression Coin. They were once the tolls for entering the Li Pearl Cave. Chen Ping'an was quite familiar with them, having bought a few bags of golden copper coins with the first batch of mountain heads.

It was said that the three types of golden copper coins sold to various immortal forces by the Great Li dynasty were crafted with the help of the Mo family, who first produced the three types of casting mother coins, which were of the finest quality and then mass-produced.

Even the ordinary copper coins crafted by the secular dynasty were highly sought after by many mountain cultivators, treasured by collectors willing to pay top dollar.

Along with the golden copper coins, the treasury issued new coins, including the three types of divine coins, such as the Snowflake Coin, Little Heat Coin, and Gu Yu Coin, all linked to the casting mother coins. Among them, the ancestral coin of the Snowflake Coin was naturally preserved by the Liu family of the White Snow Continent, but the whereabouts of the ancestral coins for the Little Heat Coin and Gu Yu Coin had always remained unclear. Little did he expect that the ancestral coin of Gu Yu Coin had actually been collected by the execution officer, manifesting as a person.

In the world, as long as a being could transform into a human form and awakened spiritual intelligence, regardless of their origins, they were considered practitioners of the great Dao. Treating them with courtesy would never be wrong.

Young Du Shanyin, having nothing to do today, stood under the grape trellis, watching the two visitors from afar.

The white-haired boy was still feeling indignant on behalf of his "Hidden Official," retreating alongside Chen Ping'an while pointing at the two women who spent their days pounding clothes and washing silk. "How reckless! How brazen!"

The clothes-pounding woman and the silk-washing girl, originally no different from rural beauties, transformed unexpectedly when the outlandish demon spoke the words "reckless," their skin shimmering with golden and green hues, faint words appearing—especially on the forehead of the silk-washing girl, which had opened like a delicate little window, likely due to the marks left during her birth.

However, they were entirely oblivious, continuing to work.

The white-haired boy whispered, "In the world, ancestral coins often come in pairs. If both become spirits and then partners, tsk tsk, that would be an extraordinary fortune. Wealth breeds wealth. Hidden Official, if you promise to take me to the Hao Ran world, I’ll help you seek them from the execution officer. Once we get to the Hao Ran world, we can keep our eyes wide open and find their Dao partners for you! How about that?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "No how about that."

The execution officer was inside the thatched cottage, and even if the Hidden Official came to visit, he showed no intention of opening the door to receive guests.

Chen Ping'an was merely out for some fresh air, so the execution officer's attitude did not matter to him, provided he didn't get hit by a sword light.

Du Shanyin bowed, "Greetings, Hidden Official."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Be at ease."

Du Shanyin suddenly recalled something, smacking his head and fetching two bags of gold powder, first offering one bag. "I kindly request the Hidden Official to accept this."

Chen Ping'an genuinely accepted it.

Du Shanyin offered another bag of gold powder, "I humbly request the Hidden Official to share a tale of mountains and rivers."

The white-haired boy wore a playful smile.

Chen Ping'an reached out and pressed down on the tall young man's head, smiling, "Even if you become the legitimate master of the execution officer in the future, don't do such things again."

Du Shanyin looked up, his expression calm, "May I ask why?"

Chen Ping'an fell silent, brushing past the young man to admire the brightly colored flower vase suspended in the air.

The white-haired boy jumped up and slapped the young man on the shoulder, saying, "You’re truly capable; keep it up! My Hidden Official is just jealous of your good fortune. Being too pleased with oneself is a compliment for cultivators."

Du Shanyin grinned, "Just kidding."

The white-haired boy questioned, "Why aren't you the least bit afraid of me?"

Du Shanyin's thoughts shifted, and a streak of sword light suddenly hovered on the young man's shoulder, like a bird perched on a branch.

Du Shanyin said, "The execution officer gifted me this."

The white-haired boy immediately exclaimed, "With this, I’ll call you dad from now on!"

Du Shanyin's smile abruptly froze.

Chen Ping'an was gazing up at a flower vase, chuckling, "Go ahead and stir up trouble."

The white-haired boy burst into laughter. 

Chen Ping'an turned his head to look at the tall young man’s retreating figure. "Within your own rules, why don’t you dare draw your sword?"

Du Shanyin turned back and smiled, "To me, you are all transcendental beings, playing around in the mortal world. That's not excessive."

Chen Ping'an merely chuckled, continuing to examine the vase, appreciating its exquisite poetry, finally accepting it.

The white-haired boy asked, "Du Shanyin, has the execution officer ever told you that once you master your sword techniques and have the opportunity to travel the Hao Ran world, you must kill all the mountain flower thieves? Did he shower you with countless treasures you never even dreamed of? Among them, was there a book solely about the characters 'immortal'? In your heart, you might regret that the two ladies weren't included, so you feel a bit let down?"

"Don’t worry, just as well I know my Hidden Official has no thoughts about them. I’ll help you beg for them from the execution officer; you don’t need to thank me! Alas, I say this, and your thoughts about them will become shallow, feeling that they are no longer esteemed treasures in the mind of the Hidden Official. They no longer possess that celestial quality in your eyes, or else it would overshadow the Hidden Official, wouldn’t it? Rest assured, this is human nature; there's no need to feel embarrassed. In the pursuit of the Dao, to reach the peak, one should be like you—take what you see; if you dislike it, discard it; if you love it, seize it..."

Du Shanyin felt a chill within, his face increasingly uncomfortable, leaving him with no choice but to remain silent.

Chen Ping'an hesitated but ultimately said nothing.

Opportunities offered too much without consideration of one's capacity to receive; the giver was indifferent, and so was the receiver.

However, Chen Ping'an turned his thoughts elsewhere, realizing that such a mindset was likely the foundation of Du Shanyin's path; who said that one's success depended solely on depth of thought?

Moreover, Ah Liang was right—what mattered, and what could be cared for? Was it manageable? 

The white-haired boy seemed delighted, having rambled on for so long without a word from the execution officer inside the thatched cottage. What a good omen! Truly, the execution officer was indifferent to everything, so different from the Hidden Official.

He walked over to Chen Ping'an, pointing at a white jade table outside the grape trellis. "A treasure! It's a pity that the book on the table, the one about immortals, already belongs to Du Shanyin. Inside, a whole bunch of little critters have been nurtured, of a value far beyond ordinary bookworms."

Chen Ping'an stepped out from under the grape trellis and went straight to the stone table, casually flipping open a page of the book. It was filled with various forms of the characters 'immortal,' written in different styles—from cursive to regular to seal scripts.

The white-haired boy whispered, "You’re looking at the book without even greeting Du Shanyin; that’s not your usual style, Hidden Official."

Chen Ping'an feigned ignorance, merely flipping through the pages, searching for traces of the bookworm.

He recalled that Li Huai seemed to have a bookworm of his own, but he wasn't sure if it had since transformed.

The white-haired boy muttered, "The Hidden Official wouldn't stoop so low as to compete with a simpleton. What is going on? Has his state of mind shifted, or is he trying to scare me? Trying to swindle me out of my short sword?"

Having finished flipping through one book without spotting those so-called "little critters," he had to give up.

Ancient texts recorded a tale about a bookworm that fed on the characters 'immortal.'

When a bookworm entered a tome containing Daoist texts, consuming the characters 'immortal' for long, it would manifest five colors. If ingested, it could lead to immortality, or at least inspire literary genius for eloquent writing.

One was a mere casual remark from literary scholars, while the other was the oral tradition of Qi cultivators. 

Yet, even among those on the mountain, the profound meaning behind the characters remained elusive. They only knew that the bookworm's previous form was a kind of wallfish, existing solely in scholarly households, hiding among writing brushes, inkstones, or shadows of lamps. However, the scholars below asserted that if one wrote the characters 'immortal' on expensive letter paper, shredded it, and tossed it into a bottle, a wallfish would surely come to consume the scraps, offering hope to grow into a bookworm.

The white-haired boy slapped the white jade table, "How dare you? Do you believe I won’t write the character for wine on the book and watch you all get drunk?!"

Upon focusing, Chen Ping'an noticed that between two lines of 'immortal' characters on the page, tiny figures, the size of fingernails, were emerging, scaling the pages from various directions, huddling within the lines, looking pitifully at him and the white-haired boy.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, apologizing for the disturbance, and gently closed the book.

The white-haired boy knelt on the stone bench, placing his hand over the book, explaining, "Once they become bookworms, they can consume anything written within. They can shift forms based on various writings. For example, if one wrote poems related to wine, they would sway drunkenly. If one wrote about beautiful maidens or sorrowful verses, they would take on those forms within the book, but it wouldn't last long; they would quickly revert back."

The white-haired boy casually flipped through the book, likely due to its large presence; every page he turned had the little critters scurrying to follow.

Chen Ping'an pondered, "What if I wrote about excrement and urine?"

The little critters froze, feeling despondent, unable to comprehend how there could be such a lunatic in the world.

The white-haired boy gave a thumbs up, loudly declaring, "The Hidden Official's ingenious ideas are rare in the world! If you ever meet the ancestor of novelists, you'll surely hit it off with him, wishing you had met sooner! After following the Hidden Official to the Central Divine Continent, you must visit that place of white paper fortune!"

Chen Ping'an sat on the stone bench.

The white-haired boy no longer cared about the book, pointing toward the stream, which actually belonged to the source-less waters. "This is extraordinarily rare water fire; it appears like water but is actually fire. The Hidden Official can use it to refine into the final piece of his five-element life item. Chen Qingdu is generous; the execution officer is even more so. I can help move it to the pavilion."

Chen Ping'an remained unmoved and rose, saying, "Inviting oneself is already rude enough."

As Chen Ping'an departed, the white-haired boy could only follow.

Mixing with Du Shanyin held no appeal; it was far more exciting to accompany Chen Ping'an.

For instance, during this visit, the young Hidden Official had entered the thatched cottage without greeting and left without bidding farewell.

The white-haired boy skipped beside Chen Ping'an, saying, "Hidden Official, today feels different; your heart is open, truly following your desires, relaxed and methodical—this is worthy of celebration."

Both walked side by side.

Clearly, the young Hidden Official was not in a rush to return to the prison.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Are you hoping to achieve your wish through that stream? Why beat around the bush? Just say it directly."

The white-haired boy asked, "Can it be accomplished by speaking directly?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Of course not."

Etiquette mattered; whether as a dragon kiln apprentice or a youth from the mud bottle lane, one must do what a person wearing straw sandals and wielding a machete should do while crossing mountains and rivers.

The Hidden Official, the tavern owner selling wine, the pure martial artist engaging in contests, the sword cultivator nurturing their blade—all had different identities, doing different things, and speaking different words.

Ultimately, they were still the same person.

The white-haired boy sighed, "My Hidden Official, you’re not this harsh with people."

Then the childlike outlandish demon sighed, "Forget it; I’m not human."

Chen Ping'an remarked, "Whether one is human or not is beyond the appearance; it depends more on whether they possess a human heart."

The white-haired boy scoffed, "A person with ulterior motives is still a person."

Chen Ping'an replied, "A person with a benevolent heart is still a person."

They reached a site where the remains of an ancient great demon lay, spanning like a mountain.

"Let’s go!" 

Chen Ping'an took a heavy step forward, suddenly punching the decayed corpse, which had lost its resilience, and thus, with a casual strike, created a 'valley' in the ground.

The white-haired boy clapped in approval.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the outlandish demon, whose behavior seemed mischievous, and slowly said, "The sorrowful tale of that fox spirit really lacks originality. If you were to write a book and sell it, it would be difficult to make money."

Having traveled far and wide, he had witnessed fox spirits bumping into bells, female ghosts scratching doors—one was an annoyance, the other a fright. He had also seen birds listening to the Dharma from the treetops, an old ghost wearing a raincoat riding a fox, singing "Pan Mountain Child."

The white-haired boy replied, "No worries; I’ll make some revisions."

Then, pretending to realize something, he added, "I forgot her fate also lacks novelty."

Chen Ping'an suddenly said, "I've figured out your origins."

Looking up, it seemed as if he were gazing at the white jade capital in another world.

The white-haired boy sighed, "Including the suppressive items from the Western Buddhist nations, does that count as a variant of the unity of the Three Pure Ones?"

Chen Ping'an, however, changed the subject, chuckling to himself, "A down-and-out literati typically only engages in three things: serving as a backdrop, teaching, and selling literature."

When the last Hidden Official in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall told mountain and stream stories on the streets, he combined all three endeavors, yet regrettably, none earned him any money.

The white-haired boy appeared dispirited.

Chen Ping'an leapt into the air, wearing a blue robe, rushing straight into the clouds, then soaring through the cloud sea, his sleeves billowing loudly.

In fact, now, besides riding the sword, he could barely ride the wind, relying solely on pure true Qi for support, consuming it rapidly.

He summoned the four flying swords: the first and fifteenth, pine needles, and thunder, each hovering in various locations.

Over the cloud sea, he leaped into the air, landing precisely on the flying swords, floating around.

The white-haired boy watched, yawning.

Chen Ping'an withdrew the four flying swords, leaning back and plummeting towards the ground.

Still in high spirits, he glanced at the fine stream in the distance.

Was water in the sky? Or was the sky in the water?

Chen Ping'an dove headfirst into the ground.

In the cloud sea above, the white-haired boy felt a stir in his spirit, somewhat surprised. He abruptly looked up, sensing the world changing colors.

Moments later, the outlandish demon stood up, its aura completely transformed. Having received Chen Qingdu's "mandate," it finally displayed the demeanor of an ascending outlandish demon.

It scooped a handful of water from the cloud sea, waving its sleeve to bring the clouds into its sleeve, then tossed it towards the heavens, creating a bright moon suspended in the air, thus cupping the moon’s reflection in its palm.

With a single slap, it shattered the moon reflected in the water.

The world changed once more.

The white-haired boy had already vanished.

In an instant, the cloud sea roared, as if someone had casually stirred up a massive pit. Dimly, one could see a vague figure of a celestial being in the clouds, looking down at the earth and laughing, "Little Confucian, don't overestimate yourself. Would you like to play with me?"

Then a giant golden figure slowly extended a fist, sneering, "Do you dare to take a punch?"

Chen Ping'an stood firmly on the ground, looking up.

He spat heavily, rolled up his sleeves, then smoothed them back out.

A young man in white, traveling far beyond, stood alongside a young man in a blue robe, exclaiming, "Staying in a cage for too long is truly unpleasant."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Speak plainly."

The young man in white waved his large sleeves, appearing carefree, his gaze fervent, laughing, "Dammit! Let them bow down to me!"

Very good. This was it.

No doubt it was Chen Ping'an!

The earth trembled violently.

A blue robe shot towards the cloud sea.

The martial artist questioned the heavens with his fists.

Then the young man in white soared upward, the ground beneath him his domain, countless flying swords heading towards the cloud sea.

The swordsman challenged the celestial being above the clouds.

To the north of the Sword Qi Great Wall, and to the south, streams of martial energy surged wildly, blocking the sun and the moon, all searching for that unknown figure challenging the heavens. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 793: Give It a Try

The seemingly idle foreign demon, once granted permission by Chen Qingdu, finally lifted all restrictions that had bound it. It tasted a brief moment of freedom, unleashing its true ascendant powers, allowing the world and all things to flow according to its whims, nearly comparable to the “truth.”

The old deaf man, following the orders of the Grand Sword Immortal, opened the forbidden gates of the prison's small world, accepting the martial fortunes gifted from the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Wilds. In an instant, a torrent of martial fortunes surged into the ancient battlefield ruins like a throng of dragons.

Beside the stream, the Executioner Sword Immortal stepped out of the thatched cottage, moving towards a stone table, where he placed his hand on a divine book infested with bookworms.

The women washing clothes continued their repetitive labor.

Du Shanyin stood beneath the grapevine, peering through the lush green leaves at the scene before him, his expression complex.

As the Executioner pressed down on the book, the atmosphere in the small world near the stream fell into tranquility.

The old deaf man stood at the prison entrance, stroking his beard and chuckling, “The heavens and earth are turned upside down.”

The young boy, brought here to witness the spectacle, felt his spirits sway, growing even more in awe of the young Hidden Official.

Nianxin quietly appeared, whispering, “That foreign demon actually possesses such powers?”

The old deaf man laughed, “You don’t really think it’s just a little trickster, do you? Its ascendant cultivation is merely suppressed too much here, giving it a showy appearance. It fears the Grand Sword Immortal; otherwise, with your level of cultivation and Dao heart, you would have long been reduced to its puppet. The skill in sewing, even if it touches upon the soul, cannot compare to the depths of the foreign demon's influence on the human heart.”

Nianxin asked, “It has always hoped to leave this place through Chen Ping’an.”

The old deaf man shook his head, “Chen Ping’an will never allow it to escape the forbidden ground. Once the Grand Sword Immortal’s suppression is removed, Chen Ping’an will be its best vessel. It would be like the pigeon immortal taking over, with its body and soul switched. At that point, it could roam freely in the Wilds, high up in the heavens and far across the earth. Both sides are aware of this; the foreign demon is meticulously unraveling Chen Ping’an’s heart, while Chen Ping’an remains steadfast, tempering his own Dao heart in return. On the surface, they seem to have a harmonious relationship, sharing laughter, but this life-and-death struggle is not much different from the grand battle of the Qi practitioners. You may not realize that the oaths sworn by these foreign demons are the lightest and most unbinding.”

The old deaf man wore a thoughtful expression, “With Chen Ping’an’s mindset and physique as a foundation, it’s likely that the Wilds will soon gain a new overlord demon, and the Grand Ancestor of the Moon-Embracing Mountain will surely be delighted by this. The two Hidden Officials from the Sword Qi Great Wall have already defected to the Wilds; this is the trend of the times. In front of the Grand Sword Immortal, I must utter such blasphemy: I am quite looking forward to it. A ‘Chen Ping’an’ who has ventured to the other extreme will still be Chen Ping’an, but not entirely the same Chen Ping’an, achieving the purest form of freedom, seeking only the utmost longevity in his cultivation. Nianxin, what do you think?”

Nianxin replied, “I have no preference.”

She added, “If that day truly comes, I might choose to align myself with that new Chen Ping’an and take root in the Wilds; perhaps I could even break through my current limitations.”

The old deaf man lightly rubbed his beard and chuckled, “A new Chen Ping’an, the seamstress Nianxin, and me, an ascendant—if the three of us join forces in the Wilds to establish a sect, we’ll surely have a remarkable presence and great potential.” 

He then self-deprecatingly continued, “But such a grand prospect can only be imagined.”

The young boy felt a chill run down his spine.

He could hardly conceive how terrifying it would be if that young Hidden Official chose to ally with the demon clan, especially for the Sword Qi Great Wall and that unfamiliar righteous world.

Deep within the boy’s heart, he even considered that if Chen Ping’an turned to the Wilds, it would have more severe consequences than the former Hidden Official Xiao Xian's betrayal of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Nianxin curiously asked, “Aren't you afraid of being held accountable by the Grand Sword Immortal for being so candid?”

The old deaf man laughed heartily, “I am a demon myself; when have I ever hidden my true nature? When Chen Ping’an asked me what I would do if there were no taboos, did I not directly answer ‘Death to all who see it’?”

Nianxin gazed at the magnificent scene in the sky and remarked, “This is not the kind of momentum a gold-body stage martial artist should have. Even with the strongest title, it still seems unreasonable.”

The old deaf man shook his head, “You haven’t seen Cao Ci; he and Chen Ping’an are of the same generation. When Cao Ci returned to the Inverted Mountain, he broke through right at the entrance, causing immense stir across two realms. However, Cao Ci ultimately did not accept a single piece of martial fortune, which implicated six sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall. They all drew their swords to repel the martial fortunes, and even two celestial lords from the Inverted Mountain personally intervened.”

The old deaf man glanced at the sky, “However, in terms of martial arts, Chen Ping’an is getting closer to Cao Ci. Other martial artists will likely only drift further away from him.”

This was a highly commendable evaluation from a prominent figure of ascendant cultivation.

When Chen Ping’an first met Cao Ci upon entering the city, the world only knew of Cao Ci, two similarly aged young martial artists.

The young boy cautiously said, “Senior Lou’er, if the Hidden Official is getting closer to Cao Ci, doesn’t that mean the Hidden Official is surpassing Cao Ci?”

The old deaf man nodded, “Who can argue with that?”

The white-haired boy had already returned from his long journey, and the unified form of Chen Ping’an landed heavily on the ground, bending his knees and bowing his head, gasping for air.

At that moment, the young man in the green robe, who had been silent, felt as if the sky and earth were vast, and anywhere was within reach. No matter if it was the Grand Sword Immortal or an ascendant demon, as long as they stood before him as enemies, he had fists and a sword enough to fight back.

The white-haired boy floated down, seeking credit, “I’m the one who put in the effort to create such a grand scene; you must be grateful, Hidden Official!”

The foreign demon merely saw the young man maintain his previous posture, only slightly lifting his eyelids.

It reined in its smile, locking eyes with Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an slowly straightened his back, his movements slightly stiff, and smiled, “There is nothing in this world that cannot be discussed.”

It curled its lips, wrapping its hands around its head, “So there’s nothing to talk about, huh?”

Chen Ping’an tilted his shoulder, stamping his foot heavily on the ground, stabilizing his body.

His back trembled slightly, blood seeping from his arms and eyelids.

The foreign demon knew this was due to his unstable realm, compounded by the sewing technique's influence, which affected the Dao’s suppression. The current young Hidden Official was in a literal battle of heaven and man.

Those of higher realms are closer to heaven; climbing higher grants deeper insight into the operation of the heavenly Dao, bearing heavier burdens.

For Qi practitioners, the chance to step into the Jade Purity realm lies in merging with the Dao. To break through from the Immortal realm to the Ascendant realm, the fundamental principle of the Dao is found in “seriousness,” recognizing the essence of truth.

Chen Ping’an staggered forward, slowly making his way to the prison entrance.

The foreign demon, ever changeable in temperament, was now smiling and joking beside him, claiming it could protect the Hidden Official time and again, forging a bond of incense offerings, which was a great fortune indeed.

Chen Ping’an was focused on dual tasks: feeling the myriad mysteries of the distant traveler's physique while concentrating his mind into a seed, patrolling the small world within himself.

After enduring numerous trials of sewing from Nianxin and then verifying them against the boxing principles taught by Li Er, Chen Ping’an confidently felt that whether viewing the “mountains and rivers” of his body from the perspective of a pure martial artist or treating the “cave heavens and blessed lands” of his body from the view of a Qi practitioner, he had surpassed ordinary individuals.

As for the elemental items of his fate, he had already gathered four, with only the final piece missing.

The last piece he lacked was a fire-related item.

The stream, referred to as “water fire” by the foreign demon, tempted Chen Ping’an, but he remained unmoved. His reluctance stemmed from not wanting to take what others cherished. Of course, this was a more palatable explanation; bluntly put, it was due to his lack of confidence in dealing with the Executioner. Chen Ping’an always sensed that the experienced and high-ranking Sword Immortal had an innate prejudice against him. That seemingly casual visit only strengthened his conviction.

At the Ning residence, there were indeed fire-related items suitable for forging, although the treasures there weren’t of particularly high rank. Nonetheless, they would be more than sufficient to assemble the five elemental items of fate.

For a lower-level Qi practitioner, it would be difficult to match Chen Ping’an’s current level of elemental item configuration, even those who were first-rate direct descendants of established sects.

Moreover, Chen Ping’an had been tirelessly supplementing his collection to support the five elemental items of fate, such as the green bricks from the mountaintop Taoist temple, the Thunder Law Seal from Li Zhen, the imitation white jade capital tower, and the Sword Immortal’s pennant. Among these, the Thunder Law Seal had been refined by Chen Ping’an and hung at the entrance of his wooden house, serving as a talisman against evil, while the tower and pennant were placed at the mountain shrine.

Even the sword named “Little Fengdu” and the two swords from the Sword Immortal of the Hate Sword Mountain were often taken by that little bald head for fun, all kept together in the sword sheath.

The four flying swords connected end to end, resembling the most peculiar “long sword” in the world.

Only the earliest crafted Water Mansion had not received any embellishment from Chen Ping’an.

Back then, he first used the water seal as his fated item, performing refining work above the clouds of the Old Dragon City. The protector at that time, who later became the Southern岳 Mountain Lord, Fan Junmao, successfully forged a Water Mansion. With the assistance of the green-clothed boy managing the water currents and spiritual energy, the murals of the water gods on the walls were brought to life, as if the true deities were alive. However, after several fierce battles and the fluctuations in Chen Ping’an’s cultivation, the Water Mansion suffered several bouts of desiccation, with its murals peeling away and ponds drying up, which was a serious taboo in cultivation.

Within the small pond beneath the water seal, a water dragon coiled, as the water seal poured forth like a waterfall, causing the pond to resemble a dragon pool, aligning with the saying, “Water doesn’t need to be deep; with a dragon, it is spiritual.”

The white-haired boy glanced over, instantly perceiving Chen Ping’an’s state of mind, casually saying, “Dragon pools have always been the first choice for raising dragons. The sage interprets this character; ‘pool’ means gathering energy, and ‘bottom’ means stopping energy—all implying stagnation. Hidden Official, the problem with your Water Mansion’s dragon pool is simply too small; why don’t you deliberately expand its territory? It’s not as if you can’t do it. If it were me, I’d have that clever grandson of mine gather all the water pearls and toss them into the pond, exhausting those little Water Mansion folk.”

At this point, the foreign demon feigned a pitiful expression, lamenting, “The ‘pool’ signifies a state of sorrow. I’m deeply worried for you, Hidden Official.”

Chen Ping’an, still heavy-footed, replied, “I prefer water; I’m not troubled about the Water Mansion.”

The foreign demon shook its head, “For cultivators, the quality of the energy in their alchemical chambers is paramount. If all goes well, Hidden Official, your future alchemical chamber is highly likely to be the Water Mansion. However, you’re placing a few shabby items… oh no, I mean a few opportunities, just sitting at that mountain shrine, which is quite a loss. If it were me, I’d not care about anything, refining all treasures and accumulating them in the Water Mansion, preparing ahead is the best strategy. Forming the Golden Core is the top priority for cultivators, and the quality of the Golden Core directly determines a Qi practitioner’s future achievements.”

Chen Ping’an’s Water Mansion, aside from the troublesome water seal and the transient green-clothed boy, had other aspects that were naturally birthed, not unsatisfactory, but indeed insufficient.

Unfortunately, it was clear that Chen Ping’an did not heed his golden advice.

The foreign demon did not mind; if Chen Ping’an chose to pursue that path, it would only be a small matter with little significance.

In the eyes of an ascendant, all prodigies and talents are illusions. Unless the other party can one day become an ascendant, otherwise, to those who have already reached the peak, the so-called opportunities in the mountains, all struggles for the Dao and life, are merely a group of cats and dogs playing outside, amusing enough to glance at a few times, but if they become bothersome or noisy, they would simply be disposed of.

This foreign demon had been observing Chen Ping’an for quite some time and was quite eager to strike a big deal with the young man.

Chen Ping’an’s mind, like a seed, wandered to the mountain shrine, gazing upward from the foot of the mountain. The shrine, built from the five-colored soil of the New Five Sacred Mountains of Dali, was constructed atop a small mountain, later reinforced with the true meaning of the Tao contained in the green bricks.

The white-haired boy curiously asked, “Hidden Official, why do you have no greater aspirations regarding cultivation and enlightenment? Do you truly have no desire for immortality?”

As he walked, Chen Ping’an employed a six-step stance to continuously adjust his boxing frame, fine-tuning the minutiae of his muscles and bones to better adapt to his current physique. Upon hearing this question, he replied, “It’s too far; I can’t see it clearly, so I can’t imagine it.”

The white-haired boy exclaimed, “So you need a bit of light to guide your path. It’s a pity that you haven’t found it yet. It seems that among the enlightened ones in the righteous world, aside from knowledge, boxing, and swordsmanship, no one can truly capture your heart.”

Chen Ping’an did not wish to dwell on this matter, changing the subject, “That Executioner senior isn’t a local sword cultivator, right?”

The reason for this question was not only that there were no records in the Summer Palace but also that there were many clues: the colorful Twelve Flower Spirit Cup hanging under the grapevine, the bookworms consuming the divine characters, and the Executioner’s insistence that Du Shanyin learn swordsmanship to kill the flower thieves on the mountain, along with the two ancestral coins made of gold essence and the Grain Rain coin, which formed the figures of the sewing woman and the washerwoman. Even the Sword Qi Great Wall had elegant sword immortals like Sun Juyuan, yet they were still different from that enigmatic Executioner.

Local sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall rarely have such concerns for outsiders.

What Mi Yu did cannot be called concern; it’s purely a penchant for attracting bees and butterflies, a nuisance amidst the myriad flowers.

The white-haired boy, who shared a deep understanding with the Hidden Official, immediately replied, “He’s not from here; his hometown is a lower-grade blessed land in the Liuxia Prefecture, with terrifyingly good talent. He broke through the barriers of heaven and earth in a heavily restricted lower-grade blessed land, where it’s difficult for cultivators to even enter the cave realm, and the Executioner forcefully ‘ascended’ to the righteous world using his Nascent Soul sword skills. However, due to his overwhelming presence, the originally secluded blessed land attracted the covetous eyes of various forces. Within a hundred years, it turned from a paradise into a playground for fallen immortals, with everyone fighting over it. Eventually, the blessed land was devastated by a battle among two sword immortals and an immortal realm Qi practitioner, leading to near extinction for the locals. The Executioner wasn’t strong enough at that time to protect his hometown, so he bears a heavy guilt to this day. It seems that none of the Executioner's family members or disciples managed to escape.”

Chen Ping’an could only sigh deeply within.

His own Fallen Mountain had a lotus root blessed land.

Chen Ping’an then frowned.

Typically, every lower-grade blessed land’s reality would attract waves of bloodshed and turmoil.

The situation in Fuyun Prefecture is currently chaotic. Aside from a few immortal treasures emerging, there’s also a pure martial artist who ascended, leading to a previously peaceful hidden blessed land being discovered by mountain cultivators, sparking a rush among various immortal forces. Though it’s another lower-grade blessed land, due to its ancient tradition of martial prowess and lack of arts, it has accumulated an abundance of treasures. Nearly all the sects in Fuyun Prefecture cannot stand idly by, eager to carve a piece for themselves. Moreover, Fuyun Prefecture is one of the regions with the deepest connections between the mountains and the mundane world. Immortal masters have their own schemes, while secular monarchs harbor their ambitions, thus any small movement can affect the entire body, leading to constant bloodshed and turmoil over these years, with smoke of war rolling across both the mountain and mundane realms.

The white-haired boy asked, “A business deal?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Let’s hear it.”

The white-haired boy spoke more seriously than usual, slowly saying, “Under the witness of Chen Qingdu, let me fully merge with your shadow spirit. I’ll choose to sleep for a hundred years. Within that century, as long as you reach the Jade Purity realm, you must return me a form of freedom. As a return, I’ll provide you with my ascendant Nascent Soul as a source of your Dao method, which will be inexhaustible for mid-five realm cultivators, allowing you to fight without worry about the scarcity of spiritual energy.”

Upon reaching this point, the white-haired boy’s eyes sparkled with excitement, feeling this deal was mutually beneficial, bouncing up and down in joy, “Not only will you reach the upper five realms without a doubt, but with me around, it’ll be like having a guardian deity, making any inner demons no problem at all. Moreover, before that, opening caves, observing the vast sea, leaping through the dragon gate, forming the Golden Core, and nurturing the Nascent Soul will surely be smooth sailing. There’s even a shortcut to breaking through faster, which requires using a secret technique to drop your realm to the third stage. I might be able to make you have a big dream in one night, allowing you to ascend to the upper five realms. With either choice, you won’t lose out, and there’s not a hint of danger!”

Chen Ping’an replied, “No thanks.”

The white-haired boy grew somewhat anxious, saying, “Even if you don’t trust me, can’t you trust Chen Qingdu? That old fellow’s judgment is exceedingly high and accurate!”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “The moment I entertain that thought and speak to the Grand Sword Immortal, regardless of your plans, the Grand Sword Immortal will agree.”

The white-haired boy thumped his chest and stomped his feet, “Why do I have to encounter someone like you, who is so unyielding to reason? Why not take a gamble? A small loss if you lose, but a huge gain if you win—what's there to be afraid of? Cultivators must have a bit of guts; decisive in their killings! Hidden Official, you’ve truly disappointed me this time, utterly disappointed! You’ve completely chilled your grandson’s warm heart!”

The foreign demon began to act foolishly, while Chen Ping’an remained serious, “The reason I declined is not that I’m afraid of danger but that I don’t want to put us both in a pit, as this would go against my true heart. If I ascend to the upper five realms, my inner demons will likely shift, and you could become one of them, making your self-proclaimed status as a guardian deity fundamentally ineffective.”

The white-haired boy caught the implication behind Chen Ping’an’s words and asked in confusion, “Are you saying that if we set aside that unavoidable issue, hypothetically, if you reached the Jade Purity realm, you could kill me? Hidden Official, no matter how wise and powerful you are in my eyes, isn’t that a bit too arrogant?”

Chen Ping’an stopped walking, smiling, “Don’t believe me? Why not give it a try?”

The white-haired boy was eager to try but still fixed his gaze on Chen Ping’an, somewhat doubtful. After contemplating for a moment, he decided to enter the realm of Chen Ping’an’s new idea, “Let’s give it a shot!”

Having traveled through Chen Ping’an’s “heart” four times, he had seen many strange things. If he could witness something truly extraordinary, it would be an eye-opener, and he considered it a bit of fun.

Once the foreign demon entered the heart lake, Chen Ping’an took a deep breath, held his breath, and focused his mind, trying to call out.

In an instant, the foreign demon rolled out, its face pale, not only returning empty-handed but seemingly having sustained some damage.

The once proud and spirited ascendant presence had vanished without a trace.

The white-haired boy murmured, “Good scheme! Hidden Official, you’ve played me as a messenger sword that traverses two worlds. In the vast Sword Qi Great Wall, it seems I am the only one capable of doing this…”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Want to try again?”

The white-haired boy plopped down on the ground, leaning back and flailing his arms and legs, crying out, “I can’t live like this anymore! Hidden Official, you’re just bullying honest people!”

Chen Ping’an continued moving forward. This long-planned business was indeed coming to fruition.

Otherwise, why would he repeatedly allow a foreign demon to enter his heart lake?

The white-haired boy got up, following closely behind the young Hidden Official, still shaken and speechless.

Earlier, he had rushed into Chen Ping’an’s heart lake, only to find a golden arched bridge. At first, he merrily dashed along, enjoying himself, until he glimpsed a tall figure in white standing on the bridge railing, propped up by a sword, seemingly in a long slumber. When Chen Ping’an softly called out, this figure, which should have been merely an illusory semblance, unexpectedly “awoke” without warning. Moments later, she turned to look at the foreign demon, who felt something was amiss and abruptly halted.

The white-haired boy vowed he had never seen such a gaze in his life.

He couldn’t even make out her features, just those golden eyes.

From a high vantage point, devoid of any emotion, pure as the legendary highest deity.

Looking down on an ascendant like an ant.

Beneath the golden arched bridge lay what appeared to be the once-complete ancient human realm, filled with countless beings. The heavens and earth were distinct, yet the deities remained eternal.

Just a glance was enough to send the foreign demon tumbling out of Chen Ping’an’s small world, depleting what equated to a century of painstaking cultivation accumulated by an ascendant.

The foreign demon’s realm stagnated at the limit upon its birth, neither increasing nor decreasing, with only life and death to contend with thereafter.

The white-haired boy lamented, “Hidden Official, isn’t she on the same level as Chen Qingdu? You should have mentioned it earlier; with such a background, calling you grandfather isn’t enough; I should have called you ancestor instead!”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I am not a reincarnation of anyone; you have misunderstood.”

The white-haired boy scoffed, “You even managed to deceive a foreign demon; you’re quite the scholar.”

Approaching the prison entrance.

Chen Ping’an was gradually adapting to the significant differences between the Gold Body and Distant Traveler physiques, yet he still moved with a stoop, struggling to breathe, and it was no feigned act.

This was the aftereffect of Nianxin’s sewing; the heavier the bones, the more resilient the physique. The true names of the great demons inscribed upon him would only grow heavier. 

This was while several key great demon names had not yet been inscribed; Chen Ping’an couldn’t imagine what it would be like once Nianxin’s sewing was complete—would he be reduced to walking bent over?

Passing by five cages that held upper five realm demons, Yunqing congratulated him on his breakthrough from the sword light barrier.

The great demon Qingqiu merely hid within a fog barrier, its icy gaze fixated on the heavily burdened young man.

Among the other three great demons, one who had remained hidden until now finally revealed itself. This great demon, known as Zhu Jie, sat atop an unrolled green landscape painting. Under the scrutiny of Qi practitioners, they would find it vastly different from ordinary art; this painting resembled a true blessed land, not only featuring undulating mountains and pavilions but also living flora and fauna. Additionally, the sky was adorned with a breathtaking display of stars. The great demon, seemingly perched upon the heavens, hoarsely spoke, “Little fellow, your fate is truly fortunate.”

Chen Ping’an paused, merely observing the painting. The Summer Palace had noted that this great demon could seize mountains and rivers with brushstrokes, having served as a horseman for the great demon Huang Luan for hundreds of years. It could draw landscapes on the battlefield, capturing mountains and rivers in the painting. Once the scroll was rolled up, it could crush and annihilate all living beings depicted within. Qi practitioners of lesser realms could directly depict their form, ensnaring part of their soul into the painting. Thus, in the Wilds, it was common for demon clans to carry portraits of their enemies, complete with names, birth dates, and locations of their ancestral halls, then find this painter to commission a piece, after which they would buy back the painting containing their enemy’s captured soul.

The fourth great demon appeared as a woman-like jade purity realm sword cultivator, though her fated flying sword had suffered heavy damage in battle. She was known as Meng Po, a rare grass and wood spirit who had managed to study swordsmanship, wielding great killing power. In the Wilds, she once held sway, known as the master of a sword sect, with a reputed connection to the ascendant great demon, yet they were indeed partners in reality.

The last upper five realm demon, imprisoned yet continuously breaking through, had now reached the Immortal realm. According to the old deaf man, Chen Qingdu had once promised this demon that should it reach the ascendant realm, it could replace the old deaf man in overseeing the prison.

The white-haired boy appeared even more worried than Chen Ping’an, his face filled with concern, “Even if the Hidden Official has reached the Distant Traveler realm, dealing with these five seems to be a hopeless endeavor.”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “For now, yes.”

Descending the steps, most of the cages were already empty. Among the sixty-one mid-five realm demons, aside from the two disciples favored by the old deaf man, there remained five—each a tough opponent.

Chen Ping’an suddenly remarked, “It seems I need to reach the mid-five realm; otherwise, walking with a limp is too severe. Don’t mention upper five realm demons; even those five Nascent Soul demons are beyond my capacity to battle.”

The white-haired boy agreed, “The Hidden Official must hurry.”

Chen Ping’an sat down in the pavilion, while the white-haired boy maintained his decorum, floating outside the building.

Chen Ping’an smiled and asked, “Has that thought of hiding in my shadow spirit disappeared?”

The white-haired boy replied helplessly, “Though I treat others kindly, I’m not foolish.”

Chen Ping’an hesitated before fully summoning his fated items from the Qi mansion: a water seal, a five-colored mountain, a wooden deity statue, and a page of golden scripture.

The four key fated items orbited around Chen Ping’an, slowly rotating, their radiance differing, illuminating the surroundings of the chaotic void.

The white-haired boy drifted to the steps, asking, “What’s the order of these?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Water seal, five-colored mountain, wooden statue of the Daoist, Buddhist scripture. However, I haven’t been able to find a suitable method yet. Moreover, the refining of the five elemental fated items was initially intended to rebuild the Longevity Bridge, so over the years, my battles and techniques have remained my weak points. However, Senior Nianxin suggested I rearrange a few of the fated items. For example, that Thunder Law Seal can be moved to my palm.”

The white-haired boy nodded, “Gathering the thunder will command all laws. Having all laws at your fingertips is an excellent suggestion. The key is to intimidate others; it’s much easier to conceal both your martial artist and sword cultivator identities than with your half-baked talismans.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Aside from the Executioner’s stream, is there any other fire-related item in this realm suitable for refining?”

The white-haired boy nodded, “Yes. And it’s of extremely high quality. The reason I didn’t mention it earlier is simply because there’s no profit to be made, not comparable to that stream I can converse about.”

Three “extremely high” praises.

Chen Ping’an fell into contemplation.

He knew it was that magma furnace.

For matters devoid of personal gain, the white-haired boy had no interest, beginning to count on his fingers, “First, use talismans to feign weakness, if the situation turns unfavorable, then summon the pine needles and cough thunder, ‘disguising’ as a sword cultivator. If that gets seen through, annoyed, and they create distance, then strike down with an authentic Thunder Law. If the opponent is tough-skinned, then close the distance and unleash a few punches as a Distant Traveler martial artist. If I can’t win and can’t escape, I’ll casually release the caged sparrow while throwing a few punches. If that’s still not enough, then I’ll pull out the Moon at the Well… Hidden Official, I’ve run out of fingers!”

Chen Ping’an remarked, “You’re truly shameless.”

The white-haired boy beamed, “I’ve recognized a good ancestor.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 794: The Fifth Item

Chen Ping’an put away the four personal items and asked, “What’s your real name?”

“Shuangjiang,” Wu Die replied, a name concocted by the outside demon, which neither You Yu nor Du Shanyin believed.

The white-haired boy paused for a moment before continuing, “I come from a humble background in the Aiai Continent, so it’s better not to mention the surname of my wealthy patron. My original name was actually ‘Xiao Cao’ (Little Grass). Later on, after my life stabilized, I became a scribe for a wealthy young master. A private tutor helped me come up with the name ‘Shuangjiang’—it sounds imposing, but it’s not a particularly good name. Back then, I didn’t know much and was quite happy, thinking it tied me to the world of books.”

The white-haired boy leaned back, propping his legs up casually. “That old tutor was half a preacher to me—a Daoist in the Cave Dwelling realm, considered quite a remarkable figure in that small vassal state. In his youth, he dabbled in some rudimentary dragon-summoning techniques, helping people behind the scenes. Unfortunately, he was unlucky and never achieved much. Eventually, disheartened, he became a teacher, occasionally selling poems to make a bit of pocket money. One time, he set off on a journey, telling me he was going to explore the mountains and rivers, and never returned. Years later, I found out he went to a notorious brothel to settle a score for an official friend, but ended up losing his life and his soul was captured in a water lamp. In my fury, I risked my life to smash that river god’s shrine and statue, and still wasn’t satisfied. I even ate some fragments of the statue in anger, but the resulting chaos flooded a hundred miles, leading to a chaotic chase by the authorities.”

The demon with the name Shuangjiang chuckled, “Little Grass is not self-important; it has already forged a mountain of errors.”

Chen Ping’an had never heard of a great cultivator named “Shuangjiang” in the history of the Aiai Continent.

As for all the cultivators above the Fifth Realm, including those at the Jade Purity, Immortal, and Ascended levels, Chen Ping’an didn’t know many, aside from those from Baoping Continent, Tongye Continent, and Beijulu Continent. He couldn’t claim to have heard of them all, but after becoming a Hidden Official, he had made it a point to learn about the ascended beings in the Haoran realm, especially since the archives of the Summer Palace were vast, making it easy to follow the clues.

The white-haired boy sprung up like a carp, laughing heartily, “This is a fresh story I just made up. If the Hidden Official ancestor has heard it, that’s good enough.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I can’t be certain of the truth of your story, but I can guess that you mostly hail from the Qingming Heaven.”

The white-haired boy replied, “I see where I slipped up. I shouldn’t have said I was being hunted by the authorities. In the Qingming Heaven, officials must have their registration certificates, while the Haoran realm’s officials wouldn’t have the guts or capability to do that.”

That realm, unlike the Haoran realm where various factions contended, was dominated by the Daoist sect, with a majority of officials and Taoists. Therefore, one wouldn’t see scenes of officials praying for rain; local officials could summon wind and rain themselves using techniques, and the status of the local mountain and water gods was quite low. Though they weren’t reduced to mere laborers, they couldn’t compare to the grandeur of the river deities and mountain gods in the Haoran realm.

Chen Ping’an mentioned, “I was fortunate to have traveled with Daoist Sun from the Daxuandu Sect in Beijulu Continent, and we had a fruitful journey together. If there’s a chance, I must go and express my gratitude.”

Daoist Sun, as the leader of the Daoist sword cultivators, had profound knowledge in both Daoism and swordsmanship. However, Chen Ping’an admired the old Daoist’s skill at playing tricks even more.

“Refined and extraordinary,” he mused.

Compared to Daoist Sun, he felt he was leagues away.

The white-haired boy nodded. “I figured it out. The middle-aged Daoist inside the wooden residence was indeed Daoist Sun’s junior. The wooden statue in the temple was crafted from the ancestral peach wood of the Daxuandu Sect, and the foundational intent of the Five-Color Mountains is also rooted in the Daxuandu Sect’s sword cultivators. I’m not blind, I can see that. So, when Zhu Jie said you were lucky, it’s both true and false.”

To visit another realm and pay respects to the Daxuandu Sect implied that Chen Ping’an would need to reach the Ascended realm.

Chen Ping’an then asked a crucial question, “Have you heard of the Three Mountain Refining Technique?”

The white-haired boy’s expression changed, “I’ve heard of it, but I’ve only heard of it.”

Chen Ping’an pressed on, “Can I use it to refine this divine heart? This corpse belonged to an ancient fire god’s assistant?”

The white-haired boy grinned, “Whether you can refine it, I can't say. As for the divine body, it’s not bound to any of the five elements; it encompasses everything. What’s lacking can be supplemented. This cage is meant for refining, but that furnace pool has never been tainted by the Sword Qi Great Wall, and it remains indestructible after ten thousand years. I’m not worried that you can’t refine it; I’m just afraid that after you do, your body and soul won’t withstand it. Both matters—fusing the five elements and true names—could end poorly. If you don’t believe me, ask Nianxin.”

Nianxin stood on the steps and crisply replied, “Unless I give up my Golden Talisman and Jade Tome entirely, using all the texts to construct the four walls of the heart chamber.”

Both treasured items were semi-immortal grade artifacts and the foundation of Nianxin’s Dao, a cost far from trivial.

Chen Ping’an inquired, “What are the conditions?”

Nianxin stated, “You’ve insisted on only sewing the upper body; I kindly ask you to abandon this absurd insistence.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I refuse.”

The white-haired boy chuckled to himself, having waited a long time for this performance to begin.

Nianxin, irritated, responded, “Chen Ping’an! If you only focus on the limbs and upper body with the thirty-two sewing points, it’ll inevitably lead to imbalance. Do you think that’s sensible? As a seamstress, do you believe I’m the type of woman who cares about gender taboos? You, being the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, are a cultivator aspiring to the peak! Should you still care about these so-called gender defenses?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I care. In Nianxin’s eyes, I’m merely an object to be skinned, dismembered, and inscribed upon, but in my eyes, you’re still a woman.”

Nianxin’s face turned ashen with rage. “Chen Ping’an, you’re utterly unreasonable!”

The white-haired boy rolled on the ground, laughing heartily, though he struggled to suppress his voice.

What a delight, what a relief.

Chen Ping’an clasped his hands in apology. “I hope you can understand, Senior Nianxin.”

Nianxin vanished in a flash.

Chen Ping’an wasn’t particularly worried that Nianxin would throw in the towel, leaving the sewing matter half-finished. However, it was highly likely that the next round of sewing would bring him unnecessary suffering.

Once Nianxin departed, the white-haired boy straightened up.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Senior Shuangjiang, why don’t you continue to enjoy the show?”

The white-haired boy lightly tapped his chest with his fist, “It pains me to see the Hidden Official ancestor misunderstood by Nianxin; the heartache is like a knife twist.”

You call your ancestor as you please; I’ll call mine, and we’re good friends.

Chen Ping’an asked, “If I refine it, will it affect the prison?”

The white-haired boy nodded, “Of course, the prison will lose half of its suppressive power. But it doesn’t matter; even if it’s all gone, there’s still an old deaf man nearby and a magistrate far away. Those demon clans won’t cause any chaos.”

Excluding the likes of Yunqing, the middle-level demon clans in the prison had only five nascent sword cultivators left, all seasoned and quite tricky.

Chen Ping’an remarked, “Yunqing will most likely break the restrictions and choose to leave the prison. Even if it’s only for a moment of freedom, he’d want to step out and see the ancient battlefield ruins. Meng Po would rather die under the magistrate’s sword than be killed by an unknown little figure like me.”

The white-haired boy rubbed his chin. “That’s true. What should we do?”

Chen Ping’an looked at him, recalling how he had acknowledged a good ancestor earlier.

The white-haired boy sighed, “I’ll keep an eye on those prison gates for the Hidden Official ancestor.”

Chen Ping’an said, “Senior Chengshan, please help me greet the old sword cultivator; I need to refine this item.”

The old deaf man’s voice echoed in his heart lake, “Do you need to prepare some heavenly materials and earthly treasures?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “Not needed.”

Besides the Five-Color Golden Cauldron, Chen Ping’an also possessed the “Guidance” opportunity gifted by the Fire Dragon True Person. After entering the Far Travel realm, it became increasingly clear that he merely needed Nianxin’s help to separate it, along with the Three Mountain Refining Technique—enough.

The white-haired boy’s expression turned gloomy. “Are you really not planning to transition from the Three Realms right to the Jade Purity?”

Once Chen Ping’an successfully refined it, he might very well cross a major threshold and enter the Cave Dwelling realm.

Chen Ping’an feigned ignorance.

The white-haired boy said seriously, “Then I’ll step back, giving up those little tricks. I no longer have plans to seize your skin; I only seek a place to reside to escape the prison, hoping one day to return to the Qingming Heaven. Besides, the conditions remain; I’ll consider it buying my life.”

Chen Ping’an still shook his head.

The white-haired boy slowly stood and transformed into a Daoist wielding a whisk, wearing a robe that was neither from the Bai Yujing Three Schools nor the Daxuandu Sect. Instead, it was a purple robe Chen Ping’an had never seen or heard of before, adorned with a front opening, long sleeves, and embroidered with sun, moon, stars, Taiji, Eight Trigrams, cloud patterns, and various celestial beasts—almost as if the robe itself was a vast, bounteous paradise.

Now cloaked in this heavenly attire, the Daoist’s eyes seemed to hold the shifting of constellations, his expression calm as he smiled, “Chen Ping’an, you schemed against me, made me send a sword message once, costing me a hundred years of cultivation. But you, as a Fifth Realm cultivator, have such wit; after five journeys, observing your mindset, how could I not leave behind a backup plan?”

Not only did the old deaf man arrive instantly, but even the sword light bestowed to Du Shanyin by the magistrate also flashed in, piercing through layers of spatial barriers, dazzlingly bright.

This might just be the “true form and essence” of the Ascended demon Shuangjiang.

Chen Ping’an waved his hand, signaling the old deaf man not to act, and locked eyes with the outside demon, asking, “Are you really forcing a sale?”

The Daoist “Shuangjiang” smiled, “Why not give it a try?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Let’s give it a shot.”

The old deaf man frowned.

Even if the trial ended with that demon’s demise, what benefit would it bring Chen Ping’an? Wasn’t it better to maintain a facade of cordiality like before? There was no gain in tearing the mask off for either party. However, for Shuangjiang, it was clear he was at his wits’ end. If Chen Ping’an left the prison without pleading for mercy from the old sword cultivator, and allowed the outside demon to escape, it would mean Chen Ping’an had made up his mind to let the old sword cultivator strike.

If Chen Ping’an hesitated, harboring thoughts of muddling through without either saving or killing, knowing the old sword cultivator’s temperament, he would let Chen Ping’an suffer the consequences.

An Ascended demon naturally had means to follow and escape, and in Chen Ping’an’s journey of cultivation, before returning to the Haoran realm, he would face endless troubles.

Of course, this was all contingent on whether Chen Ping’an could survive long enough to meet his own teacher, the Literary Saint of the One with Heaven.

Nianxin, returning, silently cursed Chen Ping’an for his impatience. Why, after reaching the Far Travel realm, did he seem to have changed completely? That scheming outside demon should be delayed. First, refine the item and break through; then, when successful, he could bring out the old sword cultivator. That would be much better than hastily engaging in a contest of wills with an Ascended demon.

Cultivators excel at refining items, while outside demons enjoy refining hearts.

Suddenly, the old sword cultivator appeared, “Can’t you let me have a breather?”

Every time that outside demon saw Chen Qingdu, it was like a mouse spotting a cat. This time, however, instead of reverting to the white-haired boy’s appearance, it asked, “Chen Qingdu, does our agreement count? Am I allowed to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

The old deaf man wasn’t surprised.

Chen Qingdu had no interest in entertaining an outside demon.

As expected, he remarked, “You could try switching to a higher realm, like Hou Changjun, or simply find a naturally gifted vessel, like the disciple chosen by the old deaf man. As for whether you can survive leaving? Don’t ask me.”

Nianxin couldn’t help but laugh. Those last three words were so familiar.

The old deaf man’s expression darkened. He didn’t dare question Chen Qingdu’s decision, only regretting that his deal with Chen Ping’an had come too early.

Shuangjiang shook his head.

Chen Qingdu smiled and asked, “You’re just going to be shameless, huh?”

Shuangjiang remained silent.

Chen Qingdu turned back to Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an stated, “As a Fifth Realm cultivator, I need to sew while also dealing with an Ascended demon’s schemes. Old Sword Cultivator, you have no reason to stand idly by.”

Nianxin felt that this young Hidden Official was bound to face misfortune again.

Unexpectedly, Chen Qingdu nodded with a smile, “Finally, you’ve learned to ask for something yourself. Rare.”

In the Haoran realm, Chen Ping’an sought everything for himself and asked nothing from others; Chen Qingdu couldn’t be bothered to intervene. But since he had become the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was only reasonable to ask him for a few things. Was the old sword cultivator merely a decoration?

**Mounting the Upside-Down Mountain**, Mi Yu begged Shao Yunyan to take him to that famous tavern, to drink the renowned Worry-Free Wine.

To his surprise, after much anticipation, when Shao Yunyan finally agreed, Nalan Caihuan insisted on joining them to enjoy the spoils.

The three entered the tavern, and Shao Yunyan noticed that, aside from the old shopkeeper and the young assistant, there was now a young woman with an unremarkable appearance, who was staring vacantly at the table. A stack of books was laid on the table, with one open beside her. The assistant, Xu Jia, sat next to her, keeping her company in her stupor.

Shao Yunyan recalled that the first time he came to the tavern, the girl looked somewhat like this, and now she hadn’t changed much. Women who practiced cultivation often had beauty-enhancing techniques, making them alluring.

After Mi Yu took a seat, he grabbed the wine and drank heavily, getting drunk without saying any drunken words, looking somewhat lost.

Nalan Caihuan took small sips, her gaze distant, as if recalling sad memories.

The old shopkeeper was teasing the sapphire-caged martial sparrow, laughing, “After the dismantling of the Yuan Ruofu and the relocation of the Plum Blossom Garden, even the Water Crystal Palace is now unsettled. Master Yunqian intends to take people north to select a site for a residence, and the Rain Dragon Sect’s master has come to the Upside-Down Mountain, causing quite a scene between the senior and junior sisters. This is all thanks to your new Hidden Official, right?”

Shao Yunyan nodded with a smile. “The Hidden Official has a kind heart. If it were me, I wouldn’t wade into these muddy waters. For common folks, it’s one thing not to understand fate; for cultivators, not to seek protection, isn’t that asking for trouble?”

In the paradise of Huangliang, drinking and speaking without restraint.

Mi Yu staggered to the wall and shouted, “Bring me a pen!”

Xu Jia stood up to hand him a pen, and the drunken Mi Yu wiped his face and wrote a line: “When the night falls and the lamp is lit, I dream of home, awakened by the oriole’s call, a pillow of Huangliang.”

Nalan Caihuan also approached and wrote a line: “The closest people are the hardest to get along with.”

Shao Yunyan glanced at the wall where the lines were written, noticing the differences in temperament between the two sword cultivators—one flowery and adorned, the other practical.

The girl suddenly raised her head and asked Nalan Caihuan, “Now that the Sword Qi Great Wall is on high alert, I cannot go to the southern city. How is that Ah Liang?”

Nalan Caihuan returned to her seat and replied with a smile, “What can be expected? Same old story.”

The girl looked forlorn, her eyes filled with sorrow like a spring pool brimming with feelings. “Everyone has returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall, yet no one has come to drink with me. With me at the tavern, at least you wouldn’t need to pay for the drinks. It’s a shame I rushed back from the Bai Zhi Paradise, only to not even meet anyone.”

The old shopkeeper chuckled, “You still have to settle your debts; the money owed still needs to be paid.”

The girl retorted, “Ah Liang said that debts aren’t really debts.”

The old shopkeeper nodded, “Ah Liang’s face isn’t really a face either.”

She flopped back down on the table, smacking it with her palms. “So boring! Had I known, I wouldn’t have come back to the Upside-Down Mountain. In that Bai Zhi Paradise, I would have had many children with Ah Liang by now.”

The old shopkeeper was too lazy to comment on this girl anymore.

Shao Yunyan didn’t want to listen to this tavern gossip and asked, “What are your plans, shopkeeper?”

The old man replied, “There’s a secret realm in the Fuyou Continent that hasn’t been around for long, a remnant of the Huangliang Paradise. I plan to go check it out. Once a sect takes it over, I’ll see if I can negotiate to buy it and expand the tavern. I’m about to set off, so if all goes well, you might be the last batch of guests at the Upside-Down Mountain tavern.”

The girl declared, “I’m not leaving. I won’t go anywhere without seeing Ah Liang.”

Xu Jia pointed upward and said softly, “Miss, not going anywhere might not work out; you might end up going over there all of a sudden.”

The girl shot him a glare, and the young assistant shrank back.

Mi Yu smiled and asked, “May I ask this young lady, how are the views in the Haoran realm?”

The girl glanced at Mi Yu, who, while not bad-looking, couldn’t compare to Ah Liang.

She casually replied, “Passable.”

Mi Yu murmured, “How can it be just passable?”

After leaving the demon army’s gathering place in the Wildlands, the little girl with the braids didn’t hurry to the ancient well that held the fourteen thrones.

Instead, she wandered leisurely, unafraid of taking detours.

Grabbing her two braids, she swayed in the wind, soaring through the skies. She went to the mountain peaks to enjoy the views and sought water palaces by large bodies of water. Unfortunately, it was said that the mountain and water deities in the Wildlands were not as flamboyant as those in the Haoran realm. After visiting several mountain shrines and water palaces, she felt somewhat disappointed.

With a punch, she killed a group of useless beings, and with a kick, she crushed a swarm of ants.

There were no rules to bind her; she acted according to her whims, and it felt great. When there was no wine, she used side dishes as substitutes, crunching on soybeans.

Then she was caught up with by two sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage, Luo Shan and Zhu An, who chose to follow her through the Wildlands. They had defected from the Sword Qi Great Wall alongside Xiao Xian, and with nothing to do in the military camp, they naturally wouldn’t turn their swords against the Great Wall. The Haoran realm was where their hearts truly lay, and once there, they would challenge any sword sect that hadn’t sent a sword cultivator to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Above the sea of clouds, Luo Shan watched as the Hidden Official spun around in the wind, grasping her braids like a bamboo dragonfly, feeling somewhat helpless.

Zhu An laughed, “The Hidden Official should have left the Sword Qi Great Wall long ago.”

Next, they planned to tour a grand city in the Wildlands, the capital of a certain dynasty. The threshold was extremely high; to settle or enter the city, one had to be in human form. This meant that within that city, there were many demon cultivators skilled in techniques. Of course, there were also many shortcuts; one could pay to have the insufficiently powerful demon servants disguise themselves with talismans.

Such rules were rare in the Wildlands.

At the same time, it indicated that this dynasty was incredibly powerful.

The emperor and empress were both at the Immortal realm, and one of them was even a sword cultivator. This time, neither side had gone to the battlefield of the Sword Qi Great Wall. According to rumors from the Jiazi Account, it was a case of losing money to avert disaster, draining the national treasury.

A group of cultivators stationed in the capital rose on the wind, their armor resplendent, blocking the three from reaching the capital’s skies. An infant realm cultivator shouted angrily, “Who goes there?!”

Xiao Xian merely kept spinning, circling around the demon cultivators, and moments later, it sounded like firecrackers going off, with clouds of blood mist scattering in the wind.

A rainbow light shot up from the palace of the capital, pausing at a distance. It was a handsome man with long hair, dressed in a robe of striking bright red and gold, intricately embroidered with dragon patterns using peacock feathers, making the robe dazzling and eye-catching. Upon seeing the little girl with the braids, he immediately bowed and clasped his hands, “Hidden Official, your arrival is a great honor; I apologize for not welcoming you properly.”

Xiao Xian continued to spin, including the man, Luo Shan, and Zhu An in her circle. “I’m no longer the Hidden Official. Are you scolding me?”

The man bent even lower, “I would never dare offend the Hidden Official. In my heart, the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall will always be you.”

Zhu An smiled knowingly; as a demon sword cultivator, he had picked up many bad habits from the human rulers of the Haoran realm.

Xiao Xian punched the great demon back into the capital.

When the great demon crashed through a palace roof, Xiao Xian followed, landing a kick on its back before delivering a final punch that sent the demon, now in its true form, deep underground.

Above the clouds outside the capital, Luo Shan remarked, “You’ve mentioned three Hidden Officials.”

Zhu An nodded, “Forgetful.”

**In the depths of the Ten Thousand Great Mountains**. 

An old blind man, guarding a thatched hut and vegetable patch, kicked an old dog that lay by his feet. He then lifted his head to gaze into the distance, scratching his face.

The old man’s cheeks were sunken, skin stretched tightly over bones.

The old dog spoke up from afar, “It’s hard to separate the Sword Qi Great Wall and the sword path’s fortune. Once the Moon-Trapping Mountain brings it into their fold, they can attack or retreat at will, and for the next ten thousand years, it should be the Haoran realm’s turn to worry.”

The old blind man slowly replied, “If even a dog knows this, how could Chen Qingdu not?”

Chen Qingdu wouldn’t let the Wildlands gain too much; achieving that would already be quite a feat.

To leave nothing behind for the Wildlands would be a fool’s dream. The question was how to move that wall that had stood for ten thousand years. Who could possibly move it? Those sword cultivators burdened with fortunes, both big and small, where would they be placed? It wasn’t as simple as just throwing them away; especially since Chen Qingdu likely still hoped that the young sword cultivators would carry the thought of the Sword Qi Great Wall in their hearts, willing to pass this thought down through generations—this was even more challenging.

Those young people from the Sword Qi Great Wall, once scattered far and wide, would soon understand one thing: without Chen Qingdu and the Sword Qi Great Wall, life and death would make even less sense than on the battlefield of their hometown in earlier years.

The Sword Qi Great Wall, a tavern, was desolate and empty. As long as a sword cultivator was present, no matter their rank, they would head to the city wall to fight.

Feng Kangle and Tao Ban sat side by side on a long bench, sharing a bowl of spring noodles. Suddenly, Feng Kangle asked, “Do you think we will die?”

Tao Ban thought for a moment and laughed, “No way! We’re still young, we haven’t made any money or drunk any wine—there’s no reason for it. Besides, we still have the second shopkeeper here!”

Feng Kangle nodded vigorously, then laughed, grabbing a huge mouthful of spring noodles.

Outside the small door of the prison, the old deaf man asked, “Are you really willing to part with the Golden Talisman and the Jade Tome?”

Nianxin nodded.

The old deaf man sighed, “Divine partners, just like that.”

Nianxin retorted coldly, “Watch your mouth.”

The old deaf man scratched his head, flipping his attitude faster than he could turn a page. Women’s thoughts were, in truth, no different from those of outside demons.

The white-haired boy squatting at the door shouted, “Clear the way! Let me guard the gates and protect the path for the Hidden Official ancestor alone!”

---

Within the pavilion, Chen Qingdu was surrounded by a view of the surroundings.

Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism. Pure martial artists.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 795: Travelers of the Human Realm

Nianxin wasn't someone who enjoyed watching the excitement, but for the first time, she felt a sense of curiosity towards this demon from the Outer Heavens of the Qingming World. The “true immortal appearance” of this Outer Heaven demon had profoundly shocked her, especially with the “Daoist Shuangjiang” draped in that astonishing celestial robe. Nianxin thought that if she could dissect the tens of thousands of “threads” woven into it, it would elevate her sewing skills to the next level. With a bit of luck, it might even bring her the opportunity to grasp the Great Dao that had eluded her for so many years.

“You're called Wu Shuangjiang,” Nianxin declared.

The white-haired boy crouching on the ground lifted his head. “And what else?”

Nianxin continued, “Wu Shuangjiang was a military cultivator in life, not a Daoist.”

At this point, she added, “Now, Wu Shuangjiang may not necessarily be dead.”

The white-haired boy chuckled, “Why a military cultivator? What’s your reasoning?”

Nianxin replied, “Wu Shuangjiang, the unparalleled general—sounds like a name fit for the battlefield, don’t you think? It would be a waste for someone who isn’t a military cultivator.”

Old Deaf felt that this little girl was truly not very bright. By her logic, if he was called Old Deaf and there was an old blind man in the southern mountains, then perhaps they were long-lost brothers? Indeed, if the little girl had any sense, she wouldn’t have stuck to sewing for so long. Those notorious demonic cultivators—like the Lone Rider of the South Sea, the Passerby, the Plague God, and the Seductive Corpse—were all on paths that couldn’t be changed. However, the seamstress, the executor, and the mirror seller had the option to switch paths midway. With proper operation, it wouldn’t be difficult to secretly turn into a celestial teacher of the charts. But no matter how Nianxin had become a seamstress, whether she was willing or not, she had made up her mind to walk this path to the end.

The white-haired boy spat on the ground, rubbed his face with both hands, and looked utterly bewildered. “Is that even possible?!”

Old Deaf asked, “Did Nianxin really hit the nail on the head?”

The white-haired boy imitated his ancestor, clasping his hands in his sleeves, his eyes filled with pity as he glanced at Nianxin, then at Old Deaf. Two fools—why not just admit they were father and daughter? If not for the current worries about the Great Dao and possibly losing their lives, he could have easily spun a series of thrilling tales about Wu Shuangjiang flooding the Water God Palace, burning the Fire Temple, stepping on the Mysterious Capital, striking the Celestial Drum, and attacking the White Jade Capital, ensuring every detail was tightly woven together with logic and evidence.

He turned sideways, lifting his butt, pressing his hands and ears tightly against the small door. “Why is there no sound? I’m so worried about Master Yinguang. With his penchant for holding grudges, if the alchemy fails, he will surely come after me. Grandson, granddaughter, you two hurry up and pray to the gods, be sincere. If it works, I’ll remember your contributions. From now on, the three of us will establish our own sect and worship Master Yinguang as our ancestor, so we won’t have to envy the many followers of the Justice Officials. By then, I’ll deal with that sewing lady and the washing maid, and Old Deaf can fight it out with the Justice Officials while Nianxin just stands by holding a water bucket…”

Nianxin pressed her foot against the white-haired boy’s head, gradually applying more force until half of his cheek was stuck to the door.

The white-haired boy didn’t seem annoyed at all.

Old Deaf felt somewhat envious of Nianxin. In the early years when he first encountered this Outer Heaven demon, they had clashed quite a bit. As for the ongoing rivalry with the Justice Officials, it had only escalated over the years. For some reason, Shuangjiang seemed particularly unconcerned about Nianxin. Old Deaf wasn’t afraid of the Outer Heaven demon causing trouble, but the lack of peace was ultimately bothersome. Back when the Outer Heaven demon had followed Old Deaf for eighty years, it had been difficult for him to find a moment of quiet for cultivation, until he finally had to call it “grandfather” to shake off its clinginess.

Nianxin removed her foot.

The white-haired boy maintained his position and said, “You greet Master Yinguang, and let him greet me back. I’ll promise to transform that ‘Crimson Purple’ robe for you, let you see it to your heart’s content.”

The white-haired boy seemed worried that Nianxin, being a Qi cultivator from the Haoran World, wouldn’t understand the profound nature of the “Crimson Purple” robe. He explained, “That feathered robe of mine is one of three replicas worn by the Dao Ancestor when he rode out on his ox. Although it was woven in later generations, it still contains boundless Dao intent. It’s one of the treasures of the Year-End Palace, the core of the mountain-water formation. Once the Ancestor shakes the robe, the mountain will look like it’s draped in a feathered garment, and even if a sword immortal strikes a thousand times, it remains unbreakable.”

At this point, the white-haired boy sneered, “The Year-End Palace is on par with the Great Xuan Capital. Nianxin, think carefully for yourself.”

Nianxin thanked him and no longer lingered at the door, ready to begin peeling away the words on the golden talismans and jade tablets.

Old Deaf praised, “Good skill.”

Shuangjiang stood up and shook his sleeves. “Good grandson.”

This act helped Nianxin, allowing her to gain a connection to the heavenly path. It also helped Chen Ping’an, as he wouldn’t have to suffer extra hardships under Nianxin while simultaneously repaying the debt of the golden talismans and jade tablets. As for Shuangjiang, he was also helping himself. He had previously received secret guidance from Chen Qingdu; rather than choosing to be adversarial with Chen Ping’an, it was better to befriend those around Chen Ping’an. It was clear that the guidance was a pretense, while the threat was genuine, clearly indicating that he needed to back off and not interfere with Chen Ping’an’s cultivation or lay traps.

Earlier, Shuangjiang wasn’t just scaring Chen Ping’an. After several journeys, using the Three Mountains and Nine Lords technique as a foundation, and subsequently deriving the Twenty-Four Mountain Methods known as Dragon Seeking, he had identified a “lucky spot,” termed as “pointing the vein.” In a secluded corner of the human realm’s void, he excavated a round pit the size of a mirror, termed “gold well,” then covered it with a wooden box shaped like a calabash. After that, the heart pit resembled a covered and dead water well, no longer seeing the “sun, moon, and starlight.”

Dragon Seeking, pointing the vein, breaking ground, and covering the box—each journey accomplished one step, while avoiding the patrolling fire dragon, especially that little golden figure who carried a dragon-horned sword and hung books. Every time they entered Chen Ping’an’s heart lake, the Outer Heaven demon would play hide-and-seek with that little fellow.

This was a deeply hidden ploy that wouldn’t affect Chen Ping’an’s current cultivation level at all. However, once this scholar’s mind became clouded, if there was a spot devoid of light, even if it was subtle, when Chen Ping’an’s realm became higher, it would grow as large as a mountain. Or Shuangjiang could simply break the gold well right now, leaving a flaw in Chen Ping’an’s heart realm, making the fundamental Dao incomplete. Could it be repaired? Of course, it could, as long as Chen Ping’an gifted this gold well to the Outer Heaven demon as a cave, not only would it patch the leaks, but it could also benefit his cultivation, becoming a source of Dao for a Qi cultivator.

As for refining the Three Mountains method, Shuangjiang was certainly not unfamiliar with it. 

Yet, Shuangjiang still hadn’t figured out one thing: from Chen Ping’an’s active inquiry about his name to the mention of the Fire Dragon Real Person’s teaching on the Three Mountain Refining Method, was Chen Ping’an doing this on purpose? Did he already sense the oddity, prompting him to tear his face and call in Chen Qingdu for support?

The white-haired boy couldn’t help but sigh, “Only able to create a Dao stage within a snail’s shell, restricting grandfather’s great divine powers.”

Chen Ping’an had refined four items of his fate consecutively: the Cloud Sea of the Old Dragon City, the immortal inn at the estuary of the Great Lake, the Dragon Palace’s cave heaven, and the hidden chamber in the Ning House of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The last one belonged to the Five Elements, with two optional guardians: a flying ascendant demon and the Outer Heaven demon, Shuangjiang.

The small door slowly opened, revealing Chen Ping’an.

The white-haired boy immediately fawned, “Master Yinguang, your talents are so outstanding that it’s staggering! Refining items so quickly, even that Cao Ci wouldn’t be worthy of carrying your shoes… Huh? Why hasn’t Master Yinguang started refining yet? Is it because there’s too much martial fortune on you, and you haven’t thoroughly tempered it? How many martial artists in the world can understand such worries?”

Old Deaf felt that calling it a few times “grandfather” wasn’t a bad thing when it came to flattering someone.

Chen Ping’an said, “Let’s go out for some fresh air.”

Walking down the steps, the surroundings were all shrouded in dark, natural shadows, visibility relying solely on cultivation level.

Since the young Master Yinguang was heading down, the white-haired boy walked ahead, bending down and stretching out his hands to remind Master Yinguang to watch his step.

If they were ascending, the white-haired boy would follow behind, also extending his hands to prevent Master Yinguang from accidentally falling backward.

In terms of flattery, it seemed that among the followers of Master Yinguang, the likes of Mi Yu, Gu Jianlong, and Cao Gun would not compare to this Outer Heaven demon.

It seemed both entertaining and boring, but the white-haired boy silently counted in his heart, curious how long it would take for Chen Ping’an to deny this matter, which was indeed amusing yet dull.

Chen Ping’an paid no mind to the absurd behavior of this Outer Heaven demon, letting it stir up as it pleased.

Chen Ping’an truly hadn’t refined that magma furnace. The martial fortune within him wasn’t the reason; Nianxin had previously helped extract two fire seeds from that fire dragon, which were the two eyes of the fire dragon. Compared to a pure martial artist’s true energy that formed the roaming fire dragon, those two fire seeds were external items. After Nianxin had skinned them away, it didn’t harm the fire dragon’s essence at all. However, the process of “extracting the eyes” had been somewhat unexpected. As a seamstress in the Jade Purity realm, she was unexpectedly unable to suppress that unruly true energy fire dragon. If she had forcibly skinned away the two eyeballs, it would have likely caused a huge uproar, harming Chen Ping’an’s fundamental essence. This was probably the inherent discord between Qi cultivators and pure martial artists.

Chen Ping’an had to negotiate with that golden little figure. After much persuasion and receiving countless insults, the latter finally stepped on the fire dragon’s head, making it docile and allowing Nianxin to retrieve the items.

Up until this point, everything had gone smoothly. However, once Chen Ping’an entered the small door and began operating the ancient immortal formula taught by the Fire Dragon Real Person, he found himself in an awkward situation. This was due to the rain-summoning stele outside the Water God Temple of the Bi You Mansion, which had evolved into a refining mantra that faintly resembled a disappointed person hiding away, wallowing in self-pity, operating the technique solo and causing ripples in his heart lake. Under normal circumstances, this would be a good omen of success in cultivation and communication with the heavens, a sign of great fortune. However, at this critical moment of refining fire attribute items, it became a troublesome issue. By the time Chen Ping’an sensed something was off and sent his mind to the Water Mansion, he indeed saw those green-clad boys all restless, curled up beneath a mural resembling a water fairy’s worship. It was evident that within Chen Ping’an’s microcosm, there was a budding conflict between water and fire. This was because Chen Ping’an had an affinity for water and aimed to refine an unimaginable divine heart of the fire attribute, hence the conflict became most pronounced. 

Previously, there was the Water Mansion, then the Mountain Shrine. Since they were mutually dependent on each other, it instead aided the refining process. Subsequently refining the wood attribute fate item, both water and earth assisted, and the atmospheric phenomena within his microcosm also posed no hindrance.

Afterward, regardless of how Chen Ping’an suppressed the atmosphere of the Water Mansion, the effects were minimal.

Chen Ping’an stood outside a prison cell, which held a Yuanying sword cultivator of the demon race, under the alias Huang He, whose fate sword was named “Lin Li.” His true form was that of a scorpion, categorized under the “searching mountain” entries. 

Chen Ping’an often stood here without saying a word, while Huang He was deeply focused on nurturing his sword, treating the young man outside as if he were invisible.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Do you have a method to suppress them? Use the Mountain Sealing Technique to close the Water Mansion’s doors.”

The white-haired boy wore a mournful expression and replied, “Master Yinguang, ranks are ranks, and business is business. Right now, we have a clean break, so don’t take advantage of me, alright?”

Chen Ping’an said, “Why not do business? Starting now, we’ll truly start doing business. As long as what you give is enough, you could earn yourself a life. Your oath means nothing, but my oath is absolutely true. When the time comes, I’ll plead with the big sword immortal for you. However, there’s a bottom line: if you scheme against others, I already have an agreement with the big sword immortal. You scheme against me, and I’ll chop you down with one sword.”

The white-haired boy asked, “Are you really willing to change your mind and let me leave the prison?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “It’s a matter of order; you schemed against me first, wanting to seize my spirit and soul, coveting my entangled karma and some of my fortune, hoping to hide deeper. Once you succeed, even the big sword immortal might find it hard to kill you completely. You’d take all the advantages, so why should I let you leave the prison alive? Do you really think I’m your grandfather or ancestor? If you were my ancestor, with your character, I would have long since executed you for treason.”

The white-haired boy pouted and said, “Aren’t you trying to get me to pave the way for you, to tell you more about the insider rules of the Qingming World, preparing for your future ascension to the Qingming World, and making plans for that sword challenge at the White Jade Capital?”

“Did I say otherwise?” Chen Ping’an smiled as he rubbed the white-haired boy's head. “Why not call me ancestor anymore?”

The Outer Heaven demon cheerfully responded, “Alright then, ancestor!”

Chen Ping’an turned his palm into a fist, and with a bang, the Outer Heaven demon shattered. Then, in another location, it reformed into a humanoid shape, wearing a blue snake pendant and a Daoist robe, bouncing back, excitedly exclaiming, “This punch from Master Yinguang truly showcases the elegance of the Traveler Realm!”

Chen Ping’an lightly twisted his wrist, stepping into the Traveler Realm, clearly much stronger than in the Golden Body Realm. He just didn’t know where Cao Ci was currently situated in terms of realm.

The white-haired boy slyly revealed, “For refining items, Master Yinguang holds two immortal formulas, and both sides claim they can refine all things. So, the method of refining formulas?”

Chen Ping’an thought for a moment but shook his head. “If I must choose one over the other, it’s truly difficult to decide. Moreover, once refined into one formula, I’m unsure what the outcome will be. Additionally, there are too many uncertainties in this process. The two immortal formulas have too high a rank, and my cultivation level as a Qi cultivator is too low. So, you can say your true thoughts now. How do we calculate this first deal? Let’s sum it up?”

The white-haired boy held up two fingers, saying, “Actually, this is the second deal. Nianxin will be looking for you soon.”

Chen Ping’an folded his hands in his sleeves, smiling, “This doesn’t count as a deal; it’s your recognition of your ancestry.”

The white-haired boy also folded his hands in his sleeves, his eyes twinkling, nodding, “That makes sense.”

Chen Ping’an said, “I told you before, there’s nothing that can’t be discussed in this world; you just didn’t believe it.”

The white-haired boy candidly responded, “At least I’m a transcendent being of the ascended realm, easily swayed.”

The Yuanying sword cultivator, Huang He, who was imprisoned, stopped nurturing his fate sword and opened his eyes to watch the “harmonious” duo of grandfather and grandson outside the sword light barrier. Suddenly, a thought arose in his heart: if the young people from the Haoran World were all like this, perhaps our demon race should refrain from causing a ruckus over there. Literate and educated, their hearts were steeped in ink, their guts and intestines were dark as well.

After leaving the prison, the white-haired boy understood why Chen Ping’an had remained for so long. But having seen the young man’s two heart realm scrolls, he dared not act cheekily in such matters.

Chen Ping’an then inquired, “Are there any corresponding local customs regarding the Five Poisons in the Qingming World?”

Shuangjiang nodded, “There are many. For instance, in the marketplaces, colorful paper is cut into five-colored small gourds and pasted upside down on doors, known as disaster-repelling gourds. In the government offices, clean officials who handle documents will wear Daoist robes bestowed by the Daoist sect with illustrations of the five poisons, and then they will go to all the water sources in their jurisdiction to drop in several Grain Rain talismans.”

Chen Ping’an remarked, “In the southeastern part of the Northern Jiulu Continent, there are also customs of posting Grain Rain notices up and down the mountains. For wealthy families, having a divine hand-written notice at the door is something to be proud of, not inferior to hanging the plaque of their main hall.”

Shuangjiang stated, “Once your realm is high, new troubles may follow closely behind. However, there’s one good thing: the realm of cultivators can genuinely resolve many troubles. As one's realm rises, many troubles will naturally disperse. Good fortune comes unbidden, and evil guests will leave without dismissal.”

Chen Ping’an seemed enlightened, nodding in acknowledgment, “That’s a good saying. I appreciate the lesson.”

Shuangjiang raised his hand to wipe away a tear of bitterness, sobbing, “Your words, Master, are truly touching.”

Nianxin arrived shortly, and with matters of the Great Dao at hand, there was no need for shyness. 

She wasn’t like Chen Ping’an, a big man who felt shy about anything; women shouldn’t be so indecisive.

Chen Ping’an was very interested and decided to observe from the side. 

A celestial robe, of which there were many in the Qingming World, Nianxin began to meticulously dissect the thirty-six thousand intricately woven threads with her sewing skills. Just this process was an encounter with the Dao that was hard to come by.

Nianxin first presented the golden talismans and jade tablets, saying, “I originally planned to wait until you succeeded in refining the items, let you suffer a little first, then help you create a heart chamber.”

Suddenly, she asked, “Do you have any talisman paper of higher quality? Otherwise, it won’t be able to hold these words. If the quality isn’t good, they’ll need to be stacked together, which wouldn’t be a small number.”

Chen Ping’an took out a piece of blue talisman paper from his belongings.

The white-haired boy’s eyelids twitched slightly.

Nianxin nodded, instructing Chen Ping’an to place the talisman paper beside the golden talismans and jade tablets.

She took out the law knife “Willow Muscle,” which was to be refined into her fate item, and began to peel away the words from the golden talismans and jade tablets one by one. It looked like an ordinary short knife, but the blade tip was incredibly slender.

Every time a word left the talisman, Nianxin would immediately flick it onto the blue talisman paper, and the words would embed themselves into the paper, slightly sinking down without breaking it.

Finally, Nianxin’s complexion turned pale, as if her internal organs were churning and grinding against each other, blood and flesh a muddled mess, resembling a quagmire.

Nianxin opened her sewing bag, took out some crimson pills of unknown origin, stuffed a handful into her mouth, and chewed them recklessly before swallowing them down.

Chen Ping’an folded that piece of talisman paper, feeling its weight, and carefully tucked it into his sleeve. After standing up, he solemnly clasped his fists in thanks.

Nianxin ignored him completely.

From beginning to end, despite suffering greatly, even to the point where her Jade Purity realm was beginning to teeter, her brows had never once furrowed.

Chen Ping’an felt that Nianxin could actually switch to martial arts.

Being carved by someone else’s knife and remaining unyielding was one realm, while being carved by one’s own knife and remaining unmoving was another.

Nianxin looked towards the white-haired boy.

The white-haired boy hadn’t transformed into the true appearance of the “Ascended Realm Master Shuangjiang,” but instead glanced at the expressionless Master Yinguang beside him, then shrank back, extending two fingers to pinch a corner, slowly pulling it, causing a burst of light to flow, illuminating the celestial robe. Then the white-haired boy suddenly yanked it, grabbing the robe in his hand. It was an ethereal Daoist robe, shimmering with colors like a waterfall, the clouds and mist surging.

Chen Ping’an asked curiously, “The form is fake, the robe is also fake, so why is it so real?”

Nianxin’s eyes were fervent as she felt that Chen Ping’an was too much of a novice, saying, “It contains Dao intent; in the world, it nearly manifests the Great Dao. How can one speak of authenticity?”

Chen Ping’an was amazed. His own robe, Golden Nectar, although raised to an immortal weapon by continuously “feeding” it with golden coins, was nothing compared to the profundity of this robe.

The white-haired boy angrily scolded, “Hey, little girl, how can you speak to my ancestor like that?! Show some respect!”

Nianxin responded with a cold smile, glancing at Chen Ping’an. Chen Ping’an looked at the white-haired boy, who was looking around and laughing.

Nianxin took the robe, which felt extremely light, almost weightless, opened her palm, and caressed it gently, her expression like a drunkard savoring fine wine, like a lover caressing a beautiful woman’s skin.

Chen Ping’an felt somewhat intimidated. Earlier, the lewd remarks of the female sword immortal Xie Songhua, and now Nianxin’s gaze towards her beloved items, made it hard for Chen Ping’an to withstand.

The white-haired boy informed Nianxin of the numerous restrictions on this robe. She sat down gently, placing the robe softly on her knees, summoning ten fate item embroidery needles, combining efforts to lift a thread, slowly pulling it into a ball of thread, which she placed at her feet.

Just pulling out a single thread consumed a whole incense stick’s worth of time.

Nianxin expended a great deal of mental energy, closed her eyes, and began to breathe and circulate her energy.

During this time, a tiny error in the needle’s position could trigger multiple restrictions. The sun, moon, and stars, as well as mountains and rivers on the robe, would change color. Ultimately, the robe unexpectedly put itself on Nianxin’s body, causing her soul to tremble, as if she had been thrown into a forbidden world. Shuangjiang quickly maneuvered the robe away from Nianxin’s body, showing the danger inherent within. Nianxin spat out a mouthful of congealed blood, which she then stored back in her sewing bag.

Chen Ping’an sat on the steps and silently left after watching for a while.

Until then, it felt like being in a common household, watching a woman sew under the lamp.

The white-haired boy inquired with his heart, “No need to close the Water Mansion anymore?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “Not necessary. The heart is calm now.”

The white-haired boy unusually didn’t follow him out. He propped his chin on his hands, watching Nianxin’s needlework, softly saying, “If this were real, the moment you start to pick the needle, it would trigger the restrictions. If no one helps you take off the clothes, you’d die.”

Nianxin was completely focused, treating it as if it were the wind passing by her ears.

The thread balls around her feet continued to accumulate, clustering together like miniature suns and moons snuggling against each other.

Suddenly, the white-haired boy frowned and stood up, his expression unusually serious.

Nianxin had just planned to pick the needle when she halted her motion.

Someone stepped out from behind the door, and the sound of his heartbeat resonated like a drum of a deity.

With each thump of the heartbeat, the entire prison microcosm trembled.

The Summer Retreat Palace received a flying sword message.

Sword Immortal Qiumiao handed the secret message to Song Gaoyuan, coming from the Upside-down Mountain Water Crystal Palace. The envelope bore only a seal with an insignia, without a signature, making it impossible to identify the owner of the seal.

Song Gaoyuan was accompanying Xuan Can, both focused on a certain battlefield within the ground scroll. After reading the secret message, he hesitated to speak.

Currently, the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage felt much more relaxed. If they wanted to go fight on the city walls, there was no need to adhere to the three-person rule; whether alone or in groups of three or five, they could go whenever they pleased. At that moment, Dong Buding, Guo Zhujiu, and Luo Zhenyi, three female sword cultivators, set off together from the Summer Retreat Palace. Additionally, Xu Ning and Gu Jianlong, along with Cao Gun, also set off together.

Qiumiao chuckled, “What are you hesitating about? Learn from Lin Junbi.”

After some hesitation, Song Gaoyuan said, “I’ll write a reply to send to the Upside-down Mountain Water Crystal Palace. I want to wait until Sword Immortal Xie Zhi withdraws from the battlefield before going to the Upside-down Mountain with this senior.”

Qiumiao questioned, “Are you really going to leave your sect’s senior waiting at the Upside-down Mountain? That doesn’t seem right.”

Song Gaoyuan replied, “Master Rongguan won’t mind. She intended to travel to the Upside-down Mountain anyway.”

Qiumiao let him be.

The next day, Dong Buding and the three female sword cultivators returned to the Summer Retreat Palace. Luo Zhenyi suddenly remembered something and informed Song Gaoyuan that she had brushed past Sword Immortal Xie Zhi on the battlefield and asked her to relay a message that he shouldn’t wait for her.

Pang Yuanji stood up, striding over the threshold, ready to fly his sword to the city walls, saying, “Song Gaoyuan, I won’t see you off.”

On this day, Song Gaoyuan left the Summer Retreat Palace, and before leaving, Qiumiao handed him a package from Master Yinguang.

Song Gaoyuan slung the package over his shoulder and set off alone. After passing through the gate, he reached the Upside-down Mountain and found the Water Crystal Palace, where he saw his sect’s female ancestor, Master Rongguan.

The young sword cultivator, upon seeing his ancestor, didn’t care that there were several female immortal teachers from the Rain Dragon Sect beside Master Rongguan. With reddened eyes, he trembled as he said, “So many have died. Senior Xie Zhi has also not returned home.”

Master Rongguan sighed, unsure how to comfort this junior.

The young sword cultivator, Xuan Can from the Golden Armored Continent, crossed the gate with the female sword immortal Song Ping, heading straight for a ferry.

Song Ping was filled with a heavy aura of killing intent, as though her mind hadn’t truly departed from the battlefield.

Also accompanying them were two young girls from the Sword Qi Great Wall, both of whom were young cultivators. The one with a stern face was named Sun Zao, while her sister Sun Qu was practicing martial arts. Unlike Sun Zao, the other girl, named Jin Luan, was looking around curiously.

They would follow Sword Immortal Song Ping in her training, and once they reached Song Ping’s sect, they would be formally accepted as direct disciples in the Ancestor Hall.

The group reached the ferry near the Mi Lu Cliff, where they would board a ferry to cross over to the Golden Armored Continent.

Song Ping and Xuan Can were returning home, while the two girls were leaving their home for the first time, traveling thousands of miles away.

At the ferry, the female sword immortal bought two boarding jade tokens. When it came time to board, the ferry attendant questioned why the two little girls didn’t have jade tokens, as that was against the rules.

Of course, Song Ping recognized them; he wasn’t blind. Such stunningly beautiful girls carrying a long sword rumored to contain a vast amount of sword energy, cultivators from both the Golden Armored and the Fuyao continents could easily identify them.

Song Ping said, “I’m giving you face, so take it well.”

Xuan Can remained calm, feeling that Song Ping’s words were entirely justified.

In the end, the ferry attendant rushed over, personally paving the way for them to board.

Jin Luan’s mouth dropped open slightly, as she was somewhat bewildered. This was not how Sword Immortal Song Ping usually interacted with them; she was always smiling and gentle, with an excellent temperament.

The ferry provided several good rooms, and Song Ping took the two little girls to a scenic viewing platform, smiling, “This is the scenery of the Haoran World.”

Jin Luan whispered, “There’s too little sword energy.”

Sun Zao rolled her eyes, “Of course. Can it compare to our Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Jin Luan fell silent, not because she was afraid of Sun Zao, but because she was intrigued by the various stories of the mountains and rivers that Sun Zao had shared.

Song Ping gently said, “So you need to adapt quickly. Once you reach the sect on the Golden Armored Continent, your master will reserve two peaks rich in spiritual energy for you, and when you reach the Golden Core Realm, a peak-opening ceremony can be held, and that will be your residence. From that moment on, you will finally have stable footing in the Haoran World.”

On the viewing platform of the adjacent room, the young sword cultivator stretched out his hand, lightly waving, greeting the two little girls.

Jin Luan stood on tiptoe, smiling brightly, “Brother Xuan Can!”

Xuan Can made a face at her.

Sun Zao suddenly became sad and gently tugged at the female sword immortal’s sleeve, sobbing, “Master, I miss home.”

Song Ping held the little girl’s hand, softly saying, “In the future, apart from your master, don’t say such things to anyone else.”

Sun Zao, unaware of the context, quickly wiped her tears away, nodding with a smile.

As night fell, a gaunt and tall old man stepped through the gate, immediately stopping to close his eyes, tilting his head to sniff the air, chuckling, “Long time no see.”

It was the Jade Purity realm sword immortal Pu He, though now he had regressed to the Yuanying realm. Even dressed in a robe, he couldn’t hide the lingering stench of blood on him.

Following Pu He into the Upside-down Mountain were Cao Gun and a pair of young sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Cao Gun had only become a sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage when he was still at the Dragon Gate realm, but now he was a guest at the Golden Core level.

The youth and girl Pu He had taken from the Sword Qi Great Wall were not particularly outstanding talents; the boy was merely at the cave dwelling level, having ordinary aptitude among the sword cultivators. 

However, they suited Pu He’s taste.

As for the sea-viewing realm girl, she had better aptitude, but Pu He planned to have a close friend from the mountain teach her; as a sword immortal known for his fighting prowess in the Liuxia Continent, he naturally had several cherished female friends. Although the other party now outranked him by a realm, even if she still looked like a young girl, once they met, she would still have to call him “Big Brother Pu” in a roundabout way.

The boy complained, “Pu Laoye, when will you become a sword immortal again? Otherwise, I’d be too embarrassed to have you as my master.”

Pu He scoffed, “Taking you as a disciple at the cave dwelling level—do you think that would bring me honor? Do you know that at the drinking parties in Liuxia Continent, Golden Core cultivators aren’t even qualified to sit? They can only stand and drink?”

Cao Gun had nothing to retort.

After all, what Pu He said was absolutely true. A proud Golden Core Earth Immortal would often avoid attending banquets where Pu He was present, but many were willing to go otherwise.

The boy angrily shouted, “Don’t call me ‘old man’ again!”

Pu He, unfazed, laughed, “Just as I expected from my disciple. When you don’t drink, you talk nonsense; after you drink, you’ll unsheathe your sword at the slightest disagreement, making everyone in the continent look at you!”

However, the boy refused to appreciate it, saying, “A little Yuanying, acting so tough. If it weren’t for your familiar face, people would think a Transcended Realm practitioner is yawning here.”

Cao Gun felt increasingly speechless.

What kind of master had what kind of disciple—it was a family affair.

The quiet girl envied her peers’ boldness. She wouldn’t dare speak to the sword immortal Pu He like that.

The boy remarked, “I’ve heard you have many enemies in the Liuxia Continent. Now that you’ve regressed, won’t it endanger me being butchered by your enemies?”

Pu He pressed down on the boy’s head, pushing him away, “Stop saying such ominous words.”

The ferry they were riding would stop at the ferry near Lingzhi Zhai. Pu He had just planned to visit that immortal shop to buy a few items, but he had very little money left in his pocket, so he could only choose the cheaper items. If that didn’t work, he’d have to borrow money from that brat Cao Gun; the depth of friendship in the Sword Qi Great Wall was determined by lending money and inviting drinks, after all—it was a one-way trip.

At Lingzhi Zhai, the girl was lively and spirited, while the boy didn’t want to enter, merely sitting on the steps. 

Cao Gun accompanied him, sitting beside him.

A group of people boarded the ferry overnight. The boy leaned on the railing, weakly saying, “Pu Laoye, is this really your Haoran World? It doesn’t look that impressive.”

Pu He chuckled, “Remember this: practicing sword on the Sword Qi Great Wall is different from practicing sword in the Haoran World. Therefore, if your realm stagnates in the future, it’s perfectly normal; you don’t need to be anxious. I, Pu He, will eventually have a great sword immortal as my disciple!”

The ferry attendant stood nervously not far away.

Even though the youth from the Liuxia Continent hadn’t heard from Pu He for a long time and had only heard that Pu He had been defeated at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Pu He’s reputation, especially his eccentric temperament, still made many five-realm cultivators and Earth Immortals feel apprehensive.

There’s a saying that when Pu He smiles, someone will die.

Damn, that must mean he’s going to draw his sword!

Pu He was the sect’s elder ancestor, a proper chart immortal, but he acted without restraint, capable of murder, robbery, and deception, skilled in disguise, and especially good at framing others. His methods were so wild that even the wild cultivators had to call him “ancestor,” so his reputation wasn’t great on the mountain, but among the rivers and lakes, he was extremely well-known. 

Not long ago, Jiang Shangzhen had caused a stir in the Northern Jiulu Continent, and he had once been hailed as the second Pu He, both being the sort of scoundrel who’d mess around and be on the run while still in their own pants.

Yet, the ferry attendant found it hard to reconcile the current old man with the sword immortal Pu He from his memories.

Arriving at the door, Pu He tossed two bottles of pills to his disciple, instructing the boy to apply one externally and swallow the other. Once the boy closed the door, he took off his clothes, gritting his teeth, revealing a massive scar on his body that had yet to heal.

It was Pu He who had pulled him out from a pile of corpses.

After applying the ointment and swallowing the pills, the boy redressed, sitting cross-legged on the bed, diligently cultivating, nurturing his fate sword.

Moments later, there was a knock on the door, and Cao Gun announced his name.

The boy, who had been candid with Pu He, was quite respectful towards this sword cultivator from the Hidden Official lineage, even though Cao Gun’s realm wasn’t high.

The boy quickly opened the door. Cao Gun saw the somewhat restrained boy and smiled, “Let me tell you some important points about cultivating in the Haoran World. Don’t find it bothersome. As a chart immortal, there are tedious formalities—might not be charming, but you should listen.”

The boy perked up, listening intently.

Cao Gun finally said, “In the future, when following Sword Immortal Pu He, cherish it.”

The boy, named Ye Du, nodded vigorously, “My master… is this one!”

Cao Gun looked at the spirited boy, giving a thumbs-up, suppressing a laugh. 

The elderly Pu He, who had been lingering outside the room, nodded with a smile and went to find some wine to drink.

In the Ailong Continent, the sword cultivator Deng Liang, alone and downcast, left the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Having practiced there for many years, he had only managed to bring his realm to the brink of Yuanying, never breaking through to the upper five realms.

Previously, the sect had asked the ferry to help send two messages to the Summer Retreat Palace from the Upside-down Mountain, inquiring when he would return. Deng Liang had ignored them.

Though Deng Liang hadn’t stood out as much as Cao Gun and Xuan Can, making it easy for people to forget one fact: Deng Liang was an extraordinarily young Yuanying realm sword cultivator!

Not only did he have a seat in the Ancestor Hall of his Ailong Continent sect, but his position was also quite prominent.

Having come from the wild cultivators, Deng Liang had crawled and struggled for many years, becoming a chart immortal. He was meticulous in dealing with people, thus well-liked, and was someone the sect leader valued and relied upon greatly.

Before leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, Deng Liang visited a tavern, writing on a blank slate, “Arrived as Yuanying, leaving as Yuanying, never breaking through. I’m ashamed to face the fine wine.”

With his package slung over his shoulder, he boarded the ferry.

The ferry attendant personally welcomed him, and Deng Liang exchanged polite laughter with him.

Deng Liang first sent a message to his sect via flying sword, simply stating that he had set off on his return journey.

Once inside the cabin, he took off his package, and aside from a few blank slates that had become relics, he also had some miscellaneous items. Deng Liang took out a letter, which Sword Immortal Qiumiao had told him to open after boarding, claiming it was a personal letter from Master Yinguang. The handwriting was very familiar, and the letter mentioned several matters, one of which was a request for Deng Liang to send a letter to Sword Immortal Xie Songhua, and another was to help take care of some sword cultivators that Xie Songhua had brought away from the Sword Qi Great Wall. The letter also mentioned a secret matter concerning the fifth world, asking him to bring it to the sect’s Ancestor Hall. If Deng Liang’s sect truly had intentions on this, they could prepare early.

Deng Liang put away the letter, left the room, and went out to enjoy the night view—the sky was high and the moon bright.

He missed the Summer Retreat Palace, feeling admiration for the young Master Yinguang.

At the Spring Banner Hall of the Upside-down Mountain, Yan Ming rose from his desk after a discussion about an important matter, smiling, “These days working with everyone has been very enjoyable.”

Mi Yu, Shao Yunyao, Nalan Caihuan, and Wei Wenlong all stood up simultaneously.

Mi Yu said nothing, only clasping his fists in farewell.

Shao Yunyao smiled, “Being able to spend day and night with Sword Immortal Yan is a great honor.”

Nalan Caihuan clasped his fists, saying, “Yan Ming, the head of the household, is good at making money. I may not lose to you, but as a sword cultivator, I am not as good as you.”

Mi Yu’s expression dimmed. “I’m even less so.”

Yan Ming smiled and nodded, striding out of the room, only saying to Mi Yu and Nalan Caihuan, “Those who are alive, why not feel relaxed and content? There’s no need for guilt.”

At the Summer Retreat Palace, the outside sword cultivators had already returned home. Sword Immortal Qiumiao stood up, saying, “From today, before the Hidden Official returns, Dong Buding and Xu Ning will jointly be responsible for decision-making matters.”

Luo Zhenyi hesitated to speak but ultimately couldn’t say a single word of farewell.

After Qiumiao crossed the threshold, her back to the crowd, she smiled, “I’ll make the first move.”

The armless Yan Ming pinned a seal to his waist and returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall, reestablishing himself at the city walls as a sword cultivator.

The nine-realm female martial artist, Bai Lianshuang, no longer taught the children to punch and kick, leaving the Summer Retreat Palace and returning to Ningfu, tidying up every corner before pausing at the main entrance for a long time, murmuring to herself before heading to the city walls.

The Yuanying sword cultivator Yin Chen left the realm of cultivation for the first time, flying his sword out towards the battlefield, never to return.

In the Wild Continent, dragging a full moon from the sky, he arrived on earth, crashing into the Sword Qi Great Wall.

On the city wall, the old sword immortal Dong Sangeng scoffed, “I go to your mother’s,” then flew his sword towards the moon.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 796: Breaking the Contract

Standing on the steps, Shuang Jiang watched the young man staggering down, pounding heavily on his chest.

With each punch Chen Ping’an threw, golden light surged from his chest, like a blacksmith wielding a hammer to forge a sword. Each strike sent sparks flying, disrupting the flow of time around him and causing the light surrounding him to twist and fluctuate.

Despite being at a lower elevation, Shuang Jiang could still clearly see those extraordinary golden eyes of Chen Ping'an, even with his gaze lowered.

Chen Ping’an stumbled as he walked, the commotion from his heart was overwhelming. After refining the heart of the divine relic, it felt as if he had moved an entire molten furnace into his chest.

The characters peeled from the Golden Talismans, despite their high grade and the profound truths they contained, melted away in golden light after just one of Chen Ping’an’s punches, dissipating into the air.

“Shouldn’t it take longer to refine successfully? Are you hiding something?” Shuang Jiang asked.

Chen Ping’an remained silent, unwilling to speak, and in truth, unable to do so. He continued to pummel his chest, desperately trying to suppress the drumming sound resonating from his heart.

Shuang Jiang stepped aside to let him pass, walking alongside him. She kept her gaze on the profile of his face, using her divine sense to meticulously examine the inner atmosphere of Chen Ping’an’s microcosm.

Eventually, he stopped, covering his mouth, and coughed up a mouthful of golden blood. He tilted his head slightly, swallowing all the blood before continuing his punches against his chest.

Shuang Jiang felt a pang of anxiety; it was strange, far too strange. Even though Chen Ping’an used two dragon eye fire seeds as a catalyst for his refinement, and was aided by martial luck, the divine relic's heart should not have accepted him so smoothly. According to her calculations, even if he managed to unravel thirty-six thousand threads of fate, he would barely have made it through the small door.

It was akin to a gifted scholar flipping through a sage's text; at first glance, they might grasp the hidden meanings within, but they could never truly understand the deep, essential principles contained therein.

There were only two possibilities: One was that Chen Qingdu had secretly intervened, manifesting his will and drawing upon the entire Sword Qi Great Wall to assist Chen Ping’an in his refinement.

The other was that Chen Ping’an was the reincarnation of a deity with a deep connection to this divine relic, a half legacy, half refinement.

Yet Shuang Jiang felt both possibilities were slim. Chen Qingdu was not one to casually lend a hand. If Chen Ping’an were indeed a reincarnated ancient deity, the disruption caused by the Long Life Bridge in his early years would have left some traces behind, which Shuang Jiang, having traveled through it multiple times, should have noticed.

As time passed, Chen Ping’an’s eyes gradually returned to normal, the golden light slowly fading, and the commotion in his chest lessening.

His punches became lighter, his steps steadier, and his mind more tranquil.

The entire prison began to quiet down as well.

Chen Ping’an turned to ascend, and the white-haired boy had no choice but to follow.

As they passed by prison cells, five great demons of the upper realms and five sword cultivators of the Nascent Soul realm appeared, although no one spoke.

They looked at the young man as one would look at a demon.

When Chen Ping’an reached the entrance of the prison, he sat on the top step. The realm was a duality of day and night, with perpetual daylight outside the prison.

Unable to contain herself, Shuang Jiang asked again, “Old Ancestor Hidden Official, can’t you say anything? If you do, consider it a trade, and I’ll owe you three snowflake coins.”

Earlier, the two had reached an agreement on a trading rule. One snowflake coin equated to one Earth Immortal cultivator. One minor summer coin could be exchanged for the life of a Jade Purity realm cultivator. Once enough coins were gathered, Chen Ping’an could plead with Chen Qingdu to spare this alien demon’s life. Shuang Jiang had everything prepared—spiritual herbs, talismans, and treasures of all sorts. While in this prison, she had accumulated some possessions, but she had always relied on luck. Soon, she would need to take risks to seize opportunities. If she was truly cornered, she would gather everything, including those maids of the executioner, plus the godly texts and that sword pellet from Du Shanyin—all of it would be hers to exchange for currency with the Old Ancestor Hidden Official!

The young Hidden Official had one admirable trait that put Shuang Jiang at ease: once Chen Ping’an made a sincere promise, he would never go back on it. It was more reliable than any vow.

Suddenly, Shuang Jiang burst into laughter, saying, “You speak with conviction, yet you’re being insincere, how amusing.”

Chen Ping’an smiled knowingly, not minding the alien demon's roundabout insults, only saying, “You know I used to run a tavern on the Sword Qi Great Wall, where sword immortals drank without credit. And only three snowflake coins? That’s too much of a loss for this deal.”

Shuang Jiang turned her back, stealthily producing a handkerchief that seemed like a keepsake, gently laying it on the ground, her fingers deftly pulling out a cherished item she had kept for years.

On the handkerchief, ripples trembled as Shuang Jiang conjured a long, narrow knife. Transitioning from holding the hilt to a two-handed grip, she positioned the knife’s sheath against the handkerchief.

It was taller than the childlike appearance of the alien demon.

Shuang Jiang tucked the handkerchief away, stood up, and on tiptoe, pushed the knife slightly out of its sheath. In an instant, it burst forth with radiant brilliance, displaying a spectrum of colors as dazzling as the morning sun.

The hilt was wrapped in delicate golden threads, and the narrow blade featured an exquisitely crafted circular guard. Outside the ring was a series of ancient golden inscriptions, flowing light, clear as the moon, reflecting the water, eternal and unchanging, illuminating the heart and soul. The last two words read, “Slay the Blame.”

After pushing the knife back into its sheath, Shuang Jiang held it with both hands. “How about this? I’ll trade you this knife for the answer from the Old Ancestor Hidden Official.”

Chen Ping’an extended his hand with a smile. “Deal.”

Without hesitation, Shuang Jiang handed the narrow knife to Chen Ping’an.

He gripped the knife across his knee; it felt heavy in his hand. With one hand on the hilt and the other pinching the base, he slowly pushed the knife out of its sheath, focusing intently, but soon pushed it back, recalling the somewhat familiar words “Slay the Blame,” and asked in confusion, “Is this an execution tool from the Ancient Dragon-Slaying Platform?”

Shuang Jiang squatted beside him, nodding. “Indeed! It’s just that it has lost some of its quality before being discarded. It’s probably chopped off quite a few evil dragons and vile serpents’ heads, hence the heavy malevolence. But since the Old Ancestor Hidden Official isn’t afraid of it, I’ll consider this noble blade a gift to a hero! To be fair, while it’s not the best on the Dragon-Slaying Platform, it still competes fiercely among upper realm martial practitioners in the Haoran world.”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “A gift?”

Shuang Jiang immediately slapped her own face, correcting herself, “I meant to sell it!”

With both hands resting on the blade, Chen Ping’an gently said, “The truth is, I’m not even sure about the answer. I’m not lying to you.”

Shuang Jiang felt as if struck by lightning.

Chen Ping’an lifted the narrow knife a few inches. “In my dealings, I’m always honest and fair, so I can’t accept this. Just take it back.”

Both fell silent.

“Give it back, will you?” 

Chen Ping’an lifted the knife slightly, but there was no further response. Shuang Jiang couldn’t just snatch it back, especially seeing the Old Ancestor Hidden Official's demeanor; his fingers tightly gripped the handle, showing no sign of letting go. Shuang Jiang wouldn’t dare say a word of thanks, as any politeness would surely be met with rudeness from him.

Chen Ping’an tossed the narrow knife to the alien demon. “This is for helping me leave a token at the entrance.”

Otherwise, he would have to go to that pavilion naked, encountering that troublesome thread.

Shuang Jiang stood there, cradling the knife, and asked, “Is it really such a trivial matter? Worth trading a knife that’s already in hand for?”

Chen Ping’an extended his hand, smiling. “A minor summer coin. A good omen for starting afresh.”

Shuang Jiang passed the narrow knife to him, overjoyed.

Chen Ping’an stood, fastening the knife to his left side, and walked away without returning to the prison.

Shuang Jiang inquired, “So you plan to step into the Far Travel realm first, then refine your life-bound item, while also tempering your martial luck? Is that why you’re not in such a hurry about the sewing?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “Honestly, I haven’t thought that far ahead. With you around, I was intentionally holding back my thoughts earlier.”

Suddenly, Shuang Jiang knelt with both knees, hitting the ground with her fists, lamenting in a flowing manner, “What great sins have I committed!”

Chen Ping’an didn’t find it funny; instead, he felt a deep concern.

The alien demon was free-spirited, unrestrained.

A beam of sword light approached in an instant, hovering not far in front of Chen Ping’an, before darting toward the thatched cottage by the stream.

The executioner was inviting him for a visit?

Chen Ping’an found himself, for the first time, traveling on wind at the eighth realm of martial prowess.

Shuang Jiang whispered beside him, “That sword pellet the executioner delivered to Du Shanyin can also be worth a minor summer coin.”

Both the sword pellet refined by the executioner and the narrow knife just acquired by Chen Ping’an were valuable treasures, but the accounting methods differed in the dealings between him and the alien demon. Inside the prison, opportunities and treasures were abundant; Shuang Jiang’s life at the Ascension realm was even more precious. Chen Ping’an had once heard of a very hidden demonic sect on the Central Divine Continent, which only accepted the most treasured items from others in their trades. This could be the beloved of someone, or even a principle held dear, like someone who cherishes their life must offer up their life in exchange.

Chen Ping’an gracefully descended near the grape trellis, where the executioner, still shrouded in mystery, stood among the verdant foliage, saying, “We’re about to leave here. Say goodbye to the Hidden Official; you may choose one of the two ancestral money incarnations to stay by your side.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I won’t accept a gift without merit.”

The executioner said, “Staying in this place too long can be stifling. The Hidden Official has demonstrated his martial prowess and refined items; I’ve witnessed a few good shows, so I should offer some gesture of thanks. More importantly, they feel a kinship with you. They’re all willing to serve the Hidden Official, but Du Shanyin will need one of them to assist in her future cultivation; otherwise, you could take them all.”

At the stone table, the laundry maids and the silken attendants looked reluctantly at Chen Ping’an, yet they smiled brightly, their eyes sparkling.

Upon hearing this, Chen Ping’an suddenly understood why this elusive executioner sword immortal seemed to hold a grudge against him.

Money.

For the cultivators in the Haoran world, the vast majority looked at every cave paradise with eyes filled with visions of divine wealth. Especially those oblivious to the greater world beyond, they were seen as worthless by the exiled immortals.

Chen Ping’an couldn’t be bothered to explain; he simply shook his head. “The executioner should keep them close.”

With a swift motion, the executioner used his sleeve to gather the thatched cottage, the stream, the grape trellis, and the white jade table and stone stool, flying away on his sword, with Du Shanyin and the silken maiden following behind.

Only the laundry maid remained, bowing to Chen Ping’an with grace, her demeanor elegant and captivating.

Chen Ping’an didn’t want to be overly sentimental, and he couldn’t just snatch the maid and toss her to the executioner, so he returned her bow, then turned his attention back to the white jade table, softly saying, “Not even a single stool left behind.”

Not even leaving a chance to scavenge.

Accepting gifts and favors inevitably leads to owing debts. Picking up scraps is risky business; one must rely on their abilities to earn money.

The laundry maid, born of golden coins, smiled even more charmingly at his words, softly saying, “I am called Chang Ming, my humble name. If you don’t like it, you may give me another name; I would be most honored.”

Chen Ping’an turned and waved his hand, smiling at her. “Friend Chang Ming, we are of equal standing. To be honest, I do have a place in mind, in the Treasure Bottle Continent, called the Lotus Root Paradise, suitable for you to stay and cultivate. But after you leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, where you go is entirely up to your own desire.”

She blinked, raising a hand to the heavens, and from the scattered remains of the divine corpses, the decayed and colossal bodies began to crumble and break apart. Golden sand, like a continuous thread, gathered around Chang Ming, forming a golden mountain as large as the Dragon-Slaying Cliff of Ningfu.

Shuang Jiang whispered, “This golden mountain, in the Qingming realm, could refine three or four Water Gods or Water Immortal Lords’ golden bodies. In the Hidden Official’s paradise, it’s still just a middle-tier paradise, but it will yield more divine bodies.”

Chen Ping’an struggled to suppress his laughter, ultimately unable to hold it in, cupping his fists. “Alright then, I sincerely invite you, Chang Ming, to visit the Treasure Bottle Continent. At the very least, you would be a registered devotee with minimal constraints.”

The golden sands, polished by the flow of time, slowly adhered to the laundry maid’s garments without a trace of strangeness.

In his heart, Chen Ping’an agreed; wealth should not be flaunted. It was just as it should be. Truly, she was a fellow practitioner. The white-haired boy beside him, who showed off everywhere, could not compare.

Curious, she asked, “Old Ancestor Hidden Official, aren’t you returning home?”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “Not yet.”

She ceased to inquire further, still presenting herself as a maid.

Then, Chen Ping’an wandered alone. Before parting, she reached out, touching her forehead, and produced a golden copper coin, handing it to Chen Ping’an.

Shuang Jiang pulled the laundry maid to search for treasures. They had discussed it; Shuang Jiang initially intended to keep everything she found, of course. What she discovered would be theirs to share, but unexpectedly, that lowly girl, not knowing whose audacity she borrowed, actually wanted a fifty-fifty split. Although her cultivation was negligible, the ancestral coin would still manifest even if she killed her own avatar, and it would appear in Chen Ping’an’s possession. She figured she couldn’t afford to provoke him; with his temperament, he would likely ask Chen Qingdu to end her life over such trivial matters. So, she had to negotiate gently with her, and after much effort, they finally agreed on a forty-sixty split, with Shuang Jiang gaining a slight profit. She felt more exhausted than dealing with a stubborn old man for eighty years. Yet, she didn’t expect that the maid would still be dissatisfied, lamenting that she was truly useless, causing her master to lose a tenth of the profit.

Shuang Jiang nearly knelt down to bow to this lady.

Chen Ping’an arrived at the sea of clouds, where the natural waters nurtured raindrops, lying there with his hands folded on his abdomen, closing his eyes to nourish his spirit.

In the microcosm of his mind, he roamed freely.

Eventually, in the heart lake of his microcosm, he felt a stirring and created a remarkably stable arched bridge.

His true self rested peacefully above the clouds.

In the microcosm, Chen Ping’an stood at one end of the Long Life Bridge. Once he crossed it, on the other side, there would surely be a Qi Refinement realm cultivator added to the world.

The golden little figure riding the fire dragon arrived beside Chen Ping’an’s mind, arms crossed, looking up.

The fire dragon beneath him had thrived after tempering martial luck; if before it was as thin as a chopstick, now it was as thick as an arm, exuding an intimidating aura.

Chen Ping’an softly said, “Don’t start cursing.”

The golden little figure sneered, “Haven’t you been cursing yourself all along? It’s annoying, and I can’t avoid listening.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “They say human strength has its limits, and I believe that, so cursing makes no sense, right?”

The golden little figure said, “You’re afraid of being unable to leave, scared of becoming a second Chen Qingdu, while lacking his abilities. You fear that every action you take will lead to no reward.”

Chen Ping’an jumped a few times, clapped his hands, and performed a set of movements, then exhaled, gazing at the bridge. “It’s only natural for anyone to feel this way; there’s no need to feel embarrassed.”

The golden little figure remained silent for a moment, then used a string of curses to express a sense of comfort.

Hearing the familiar dialect of his hometown, Chen Ping’an instantly felt happy, his eyes clear like the stream back home, with a hint of sorrow like a small fish that flicked its tail and darted into the underwater weeds, never to be seen again.

Ultimately, Chen Ping’an’s mind withdrew from the microcosm. He stood up from the sea of clouds and flew toward the prison entrance.

Crossing the bridge was not an urgent matter; he would wait until the martial luck of the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Wild World were completely refined and integrated into his body’s landscape before proceeding.

His own cave abode was inevitable.

When the cave opened, the microcosm would connect with the greater world. The rich spiritual energy mixed with the sword intent from the prison would surge into various vital energy centers.

However, the pain of flesh and soul might be seen as a terrifying threshold by ordinary lower realm Qi Refiners, but for Chen Ping’an, it wasn’t a significant issue.

As Chen Ping’an passed through the prison, the great demon Yun Qing appeared again, smiling as he joked, “Earlier, you had martial luck at your side, now you’ve refined the divine relics, and soon you’ll be congratulating the Hidden Official again. When you step into the cave realm, there’ll be another round of congratulations. You’re quite busy. Good thing it’s not in the Wild World; otherwise, just the celebration gifts would require three portions.”

Chen Ping’an halted, smiling, “In Haoran, the arrival of a mountain-top celestial being at the upper fifth realm is the best visiting gift.”

Yun Qing glanced at the narrow knife, admiring it. “Good knife.”

Chen Ping’an pressed his palm against the hilt, saying, “It’s hefty enough; it’s indeed a good knife.”

Yun Qing sighed, “It seems there won’t be many more chances to converse with the Hidden Official.”

Chen Ping’an replied solemnly, “It’s a pity we didn’t meet in the Haoran world.”

Yun Qing laughed, “It’s a regret not inviting the Hidden Official for fine wine in the Wild World. My old mountain top has an exquisite view.”

The white-haired boy returned, accompanied by the maid Chang Ming.

The golden sand was easy to come by with her around, but what required more effort from Shuang Jiang were the remnants of the ancient demon corpses, scattered and difficult to gather. Heavenly treasures are often more spiritual; unlike divine relics or massive demon bones that refuse to budge, even with Shuang Jiang putting in great effort to search, it would still be troublesome. Thankfully, that maid, true to her nature as an ancestral coin incarnation, had extraordinary luck and ultimately collected much more than Shuang Jiang had anticipated. Having gained experience, Shuang Jiang deliberately kept her distance, waiting for the maid to stumble upon an opportunity before pouncing on her, diligently capturing those treasures that darted about like flying swords.

They agreed that today they would only scrape the surface in one direction, and in the following days, they would visit one place each day, completing a rough search within the span of ten days, and then thoroughly check for anything missed in the next ten days.

It was the maid’s first time entering this prison, so she was inevitably curious.

The great demon Qing Qiu saw the lovely and graceful maid beside Chen Ping’an, exclaiming, “Old Ancestor Hidden Official, you’re quite the womanizer, but your tastes are peculiar. First, you had a skinned woman, and now you’ve changed to a creature with both flesh and blood lacking substance. What’s the matter, Old Ancestor Hidden Official? Aren’t there seven-tailed fox spirits locked up here? If I remember correctly, there are still a few other female cultivators; isn’t that enough for you?”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “If they’re nearing death, can’t they say a few flattering words?”

The true form of that azure cat demon mocked, “Just you? With that broken knife? Stretch your neck and let me see if you can cut!”

Chen Ping’an pushed the knife out of its sheath slightly, “Want to give it a try?”

The great demon Qing Qiu instantly vanished into the mist.

Shuang Jiang burst into laughter.

The maid Chang Ming took her leave, unwilling to continue wandering in the overly polluted atmosphere of the prison.

Arriving at the thread, Chen Ping’an waited for her to pull out a strand before saying, “I need to borrow your magical knife.”

The thread handed the knife directly to Chen Ping’an.

Upon receiving the knife, Chen Ping’an smiled, saying, “Back in my hometown, when offering scissors or axes, the blade always faces you.”

The thread feigned ignorance, asking, “Have you decided?”

Chen Ping’an nodded and took out the blue talisman paper that bore the characters of the Golden Talismans. Due to the sheer volume and weight of the text, the paper appeared uneven.

He pulled out the narrow knife—the prized possession of the alien demon—and cut into his left palm, staining the entire sheet of talisman paper with blood, faintly laced with golden threads.

Then, with one hand holding the talisman paper and the other gripping the short knife, he pierced his chest, letting the essence blood, akin to true energy, drip from the knife tip onto the paper. Using the water refining technique from the Green Floating Water Temple, he maneuvered the blood droplets, writing with precision, each stroke and dot orderly, the divine meaning rich and full. Ultimately, he “wrote” out a contract dissolution letter, clear and concise in content, yet articulated with precision.

Especially at the end, when signing, he separated a particle of his life spirit from his three souls and seven spirits and infused it into the name “Chen Ping’an.”

Chen Ping’an returned the magical knife to the thread.

The thread frowned, “Had I known, I wouldn’t have revealed this to you.”

Previously, upon first meeting this young Hidden Official, she was puzzled as to why he was so entangled with the dragon family. After some effort, and a chat with the alien demon, she uncovered a shocking secret. Chen Ping’an bore a deeply hidden contract; the two parties were equal in status, neither master nor servant, but their lives were intertwined, the effects akin to the contracts formed between cultivators when they become immortal couples. Of course, Chen Ping’an’s contract didn’t involve any love, and the one writing it had all the advantages, with almost no restrictions.

Chen Ping’an’s face turned pale, yet it seemed he felt a great burden lifted, resolving a significant cause-and-effect grievance.

This was for himself, to find peace of mind, as well as for his student, allowing her to exert her full potential in the Treasure Bottle Continent.

Shuang Jiang squatted beside him, lamenting, “Old Ancestor Hidden Official, you’ve made a huge loss in this transaction. You shouldn’t have been so straightforward; had it been me, I would have squeezed a hefty sum from it.”

Chen Ping’an handed the talisman paper to the alien demon, saying, “If I had known sooner, I would have done this long ago. Shuang Jiang, pass this to the old deaf man; once he leaves the prison, have him send it to Wei Jin at the Snow Temple, to be delivered to someone named Cui Dongshan in the Treasure Bottle Continent.”

Shuang Jiang teased, “Let the thread deliver it to the old deaf man; they’ve just recognized each other as relatives.”

Chen Ping’an smirked slightly, maintaining his posture.

He had known that this alien demon had already recognized the origin of this blue talisman paper.

Years ago, when Chen Ping’an first obtained the “True Records of the Pill Book” and these talismans, he hadn’t yet cultivated and was merely learning to punch, so to him, they were just some yellowed pages. However, at that time, Chen Ping’an could easily identify the rarity of the talisman paper thanks to the amount of talismans he had. One was used up in the Dragon-Slaying Gorge, another given to Zhong Kui in Tongyezhou, and now another was used.

Shuang Jiang raised both hands. “Stop testing me; I promise I won’t touch this talisman paper. If I do, I might accidentally fall into your trap, losing a hundred years of cultivation.”

When the alien demon didn’t address him as ‘Old Ancestor Hidden Official’ or ‘Old Ancestor,’ it often meant she was speaking sincerely.

Eventually, Chen Ping’an handed the talisman paper to the thread.

In a flash, she disappeared to deliver it to the old deaf man, returning almost instantaneously. “Good thing I went early; the old deaf man was just about to leave the prison.”

Some words lingered in the thread’s mind, but she chose not to voice them. Initially, she had wanted to urge Chen Ping’an to hurry with the task of slaying demons and sewing, but the words died on her lips.

Chen Ping’an nodded, heading toward the pavilion alone, sitting with his arms around his knees.

Shuang Jiang stood on the distant steps, watching that building with that person inside.

This place represented the manifestation of the young man’s state of mind.

Thus, Chen Qingdu could go to the pavilion, and even the thread could go if she wished, for deep within Chen Ping’an, he accepted the alien demon as one of his own, but he would never permit this alien demon.

He stood in the pavilion of heaven and earth.

The foundation was made of the principles, both major and minor, that Chen Ping’an sincerely recognized.

The four pillars of the pavilion represented the four fundamental veins he gradually transformed into his own as he traveled through life.

And the pavilion’s peak symbolized the great sword immortal that Chen Ping’an constantly envisioned.

The young man viewed life as a temporary guest at a pavilion, eventually destined to part ways with all, some with farewells, others without a word. 

He remained in place, willing to perform small acts of kindness to shield others from the wind and rain.

The higher the realm, the more separations one would endure. Perhaps that’s why the young man had always held no ambition regarding achieving immortality. While he feared death, he also did not desire to live forever.

Shuang Jiang called out loudly, “Old Ancestor Hidden Official, does that beloved lady of yours know about this contract?”

Chen Ping’an snapped back to reality, feigning calmness. “This contract has nothing to do with me.”

Shuang Jiang leapt high, giving him a thumbs up. “Old Ancestor Hidden Official, you’re quite the bold one, especially for a scholar!”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 797: The Purpose of Hard Training

Frostfall tentatively asked, "What if I exchanged a large piece of gold body fragment for a little story to bind with the Hidden Official Ancestor?" 

The story was not trivial at all.

Just for the matter of the contract dissolution, Chen Ping'an had to use the ancient executioner's sword from the Dragon-Slaying Platform, employing a blue talisman to carry blood, extracting a drop of his heart's essence, and even separating strands from his three souls and seven spirits to infuse them into the signature at the end. 

Ordinary practitioners wouldn't need to make such a fuss to form or dissolve contracts. If she didn't engage in such transactions, Frostfall felt that she might invite divine retribution. 

However, Chen Ping'an wasn't interested in this deal. With that ancestor in the form of the golden coin old man, she could very well serve as a registered offering at Falling Fortune Mountain, which had a treasure-gathering basin. Chen Ping'an felt indifferent to fame and fortune now; he certainly wouldn't be blinded by money. 

Once the executioner left, the old deaf man also departed. All the heavenly materials and earthly treasures here, no matter how many legs they grew, couldn't escape from this prison realm. Chen Ping'an had always wanted to ask the senior sword immortal why he didn't clear out the wealth here and hand it over to the Summer Resort to manage, or move it to the alchemy shop for disposal. Unfortunately, the senior sword immortal never gave him the chance; every time he appeared, Chen Ping'an's fate was not very good. 

Even the mud Buddha had some anger. Why couldn't the Packing Studio open elsewhere? Besides, in the endless future, there might not be an end, so he had to find something to do, like counting money or refining objects.

Chen Ping'an flipped his wrist and summoned the strange five-thunder talisman, cradling it in his palm. Though it was only the size of a jujube pit, it faintly emanated thunder, shimmering with colorful light, creating an imposing atmosphere that naturally overpowered any malevolent spirits or filth.

Similar to the imitation of the white jade capital's pagoda and the sword immortal's banner, Chen Ping'an didn't dare to refine it into his life-bound object directly; he only performed a middle-tier refinement. First, there was no need for heavy refinement, and second, he didn't dare to act recklessly. After all, it was something obtained from Li Zhen, and he worried about what could happen if he acted carelessly. Just like the pine needles and cough thunder, he had only been able to transition from middle-tier to heavy refinement after a long time. 

Of course, it wasn't that he didn't trust Liu Jinglong and Yuan Lingdian; it was just that heavy-refined items were not ordinary. Besides occupying a whole life-bound aperture, they would also siphon off the practitioner's spiritual energy. For a Qi Practitioner of the lower fifth realm, who had not opened many apertures and lacked deep spiritual reserves, these two issues were monumental challenges. 

Now as a fifth realm practitioner, Chen Ping'an actually had quite a few apertures, but just for the sake of the Eternal Life Bridge's five-element refinement, he had to allocate five of them to diligently refine, and how much surplus spiritual energy could he use to "reward his vassals"? This was what they called "a clever housewife can't cook without rice"; otherwise, if he just opened a water residence, then with all the opportunities he gained on his journeys, the little green-clad boys would not be so idle. For example, the replenishment from that bottle of water spirit elixir; every time the water residence faced a long drought, the spiritual energy still needed to be shared with places like the mountain shrine and wooden residence. 

Even with just a middle-tier refinement of this talisman, Chen Ping'an believed that relying solely on this treasure from the mountain, in that small nation under the jurisdiction of the Treasure Bottle Continent, becoming a god-like figure capable of slaying demons and performing miraculous spells would be no problem at all. Moreover, even when traversing the mountains and wilds, he would be regarded as a renowned celestial teacher because practicing the Five Thunder Technique, if the method and principles were not authentic, could easily harm one's internal organs, and over time, lead to irreversible physical damage. For instance, the blind Daoist Jiu Cheng was blinded because he practiced a side technique of thunder. 

Thinking of this, Chen Ping'an couldn't help but chuckle to himself. 

Suddenly, he asked, "Isn't that gold sand?" 

Frostfall pulled out a piece of gold body fragment, about the size of an orange, tossing it lightly. Such a treasure was rare, and mining it took considerable effort. 

With his left hand controlling the five-thunder talisman, Chen Ping'an reached out with his right hand to grab the fragment from the hands of the external celestial demon, clutching it in his palm. After a moment, he used the Three Mountains Refining Technique to refine the gold body fragment into a droplet of golden water, then caught it with his finger, gently applying it to the "Gather" character of the five-thunder talisman, much like how temples and Taoist shrines gild idols. 

During this gilding process, the five life-bound apertures within Chen Ping'an each had a trace of spiritual energy flowing autonomously, as if receiving a command, circulating in his palm and rising to surround the five-thunder talisman. This helped to accelerate the refinement of that droplet of golden water into the talisman, much faster than just gilding using the Refining Objects Immortal Technique. This illustrated the advantage of a practitioner pouring their five-element life-bound objects into the task; the intricate processes were ineffably profound. 

After putting away the talisman and gold body fragment, Chen Ping'an said, "My hometown is in the Li Pearl Cave Heaven. When I was little, on a snowy night, I happened to wake up from a nightmare and then heard some noises at the door, almost as if I heard a faint voice. The wind and snow that night were fierce, so I couldn't hear clearly; it felt quite eerie. At that moment, I hesitated, unsure whether to go out or stay hidden under the covers. I also wondered if Song Jixin might have heard it too; he was bold and would likely go out first." 

At this point, Chen Ping'an suddenly didn't know how to define Zhi Gui. 

Frostfall, who was familiar with Chen Ping'an's various mental processes, revealed the truth, "There are two possibilities why she didn't seek out the prince Song Jixin. One is that she chose to walk into the alley from the west of Mud Bottle Lane, finding it difficult to enter; even though it was just one door away, she was already exhausted, so she collapsed at your door, unable to knock on Song Jixin's courtyard. This is the fateful connection that exists in the universe. The other possibility is that she entered Mud Bottle Lane from Gu Can's house, arrived at Song Jixin's doorstep, and changed her mind at the last moment because, being bound to a dragon of the Great Li Song clan, she had too many restrictions. She might have been forced to sign a genuine master-servant contract, with her life and death in others' hands, which is not a comfortable choice for the last true dragon's remnant in this world. After being saved by you, she secretly formed a contract with you because your life-bound porcelain was shattered, and your spirit was frail; the contract was formed without anyone knowing. She could then enjoy her life in peace, whether standing, sitting, or lying down!" 

Chen Ping'an nodded and said, "That's indeed the case." 

"My Hidden Official Ancestor, how could you engage in such transactions?" 

Frostfall lamented, "You and that girl called Zhi Gui have an equal contract; the more you suffer at the beginning, the more you will enjoy later. What are you thinking, Hidden Official Ancestor? It’s clear that if you just hold on a bit longer and don’t write such a definitive dissolution in the contract, your later years could be smooth sailing! It's as if you are lying down and breaking through, in that Book Lake, how could that ungrateful mud snake of a child that you despise not return the favor to Gu Can’s body and soul? Don’t you know that?" 

The white-haired boy spoke passionately, gesticulating wildly, "No matter what that Prince Zhu did to steal your destiny, the more he achieves, the more he will speak of reciprocity in the world. This is a universal truth. So as long as she truly transforms into a dragon, you will be credited for it, and it would be a genuine act of helping a dragon. From now on, you will earn a steady stream of income. Every time she breaks through, she will return benefits to the person she contracted with, forming Golden Pills and nurturing Original Infants; how is that a difficult thing? Just considering the natural superiority over the attributes of the dragon and even the water god lake lord, which practitioner wouldn't yearn for that?" 

Chen Ping'an stood up and began to stroll, smiling, "I only know that when bestowing kindness upon others, one should not expect anything in return. Back then, I didn’t understand the matter of contracts; I only knew that saving her was a casual act." 

The monk's alms-gathering is a form of forming connections. Daoists also believe that every sip and every bite has its destiny.

Frostfall cautiously said, "Hidden Official Ancestor, you are a Confucian disciple. A gentleman bestows kindness without expecting rewards; I can barely understand that. But she has harmed your fortune for many years; are you still willing to repay evil with kindness? Could it be that you have the suspicion of being too kind-hearted?" 

Chen Ping'an shook his head and said, "There are priorities and weights to things. First of all, Zhi Gui is, in my heart, just a neighbor and far less important than the Great Li's situation. Moreover, repaying evil with kindness? You know very well that this is actually contrary to my fundamental teachings. Priorities and severity must be clarified before discussing forgiveness and absolution." 

Chen Ping'an paused for a moment, resting his palm against the hilt of the Dragon-Slaying Executioner's sword, and smiled, "Assuming that the big matter is resolved, how about you let her stand in front of me now?" 

Frostfall felt a headache at the mere mention of "let's try." 

Chen Ping'an continued, "If we set aside right and wrong and conspiracies, just focusing on the matter of me being neighbors with Song Jixin and Zhi Gui, it’s not as bad as you imagine. In fact, I can say that having them living next door gives me some extra hope for survival. At least I know what a good life for common folks looks like; they don’t lack money, and there’s no worry about food and clothing. Have you ever heard the sound of a kitchen knife slicing fish scales on the cutting board, or the sun shining while a wooden stick gently taps on a thick quilt on the bamboo pole? It’s all very pleasant. I never learned to read or write, but I’ve heard plenty of words from books, thanks to Song Jixin's boring recitations." 

In those days, Chen Ping'an was completely in the dark. His thoughts solely revolved around the daily meals, fears of heatstroke in summer, cold in winter, and lacking the festive atmosphere in spring and the worries of insufficient harvests in autumn. 

In dealing with that neighborly master and servant, the boy from Mud Bottle Lane would help whenever possible, such as helping Zhi Gui carry water or drying books on the wall between their two houses. At that time, Song Jixin, as the "illegitimate son of Lord Supervisor Song," seemed to have endless money, as if it fell from the sky, and he spent it without a care. 

The lane was too narrow, and Song Jixin, being someone who enjoyed luxury and avoided trouble, would always just let Zhi Gui buy firewood and charcoal in bulk, solving the problem for the entire winter. 

If Chen Ping'an saw it, he would help too. At that time, it was as if the exhausted Zhi Gui would lift her skirt to run to the house’s door and call for Chen Ping'an to come out to assist. 

Chen Ping'an would never refuse; doing these trivial things wasn’t out of any ulterior motives. To the contrary, it was precisely because he treated everyone around him with respect that he felt it was a matter of course, doing these things would leave his clothes dusty and sooty, but his heart was pure. Moreover, compared to helping the neighbor, Chen Ping'an had done even more for Gu Can’s family. 

Besides, at that time, that grass shoe boy was completely ignorant of matters between men and women. 

So, Song Jixin, a petty and small-minded peer, never suspected that Chen Ping'an had any thoughts about Zhi Gui; he was only sensitive and hostile towards Liu Xianyang and Ma Kuxuan. 

Occasionally, when Zhi Gui was picking vegetables in the neighboring yard, she would also tentatively converse with Chen Ping'an, saying that he had helped the Gu family so much, he should at least ask for some reward, even if it wasn’t money. Her family’s farmland was managed by him, so it was only reasonable to ask for a few sheng (a measure of rice), and if that vixen of a woman didn’t agree, then that would be a problem with her character, always wanting to take advantage of Chen Ping'an. In the small town, there were plenty of opportunities for long-term and short-term labor, helping with joyous and sorrowful occasions, where money could be earned. 

Song Yushao once drunkenly said something while having hot pot; at that time, Chen Ping'an didn’t think much of it. Now, as a man in his thirties, he was no longer a boy from many years ago. 

Upon reflecting carefully, he discerned many aftertastes. It was like drinking a bowl of aged rice wine, with a strong lingering effect that remained in his heart for years. 

In his youth, his memory was sharp. Whenever he thought of home, everything was vividly clear in his mind; his heart would stir, and he felt as if he was back home. 

As he aged, his memories grew hazy; whenever he thought of home, it felt even further away. The helplessness of life probably lay here. 

Frostfall smiled and nodded, "I actually understand quite a bit about the trivialities of life." 

Chen Ping'an teased, "A dignified ascended master knows about these things?" 

According to what it had previously shared with Chen Ping'an about its life story, as a wandering orphan, "Little Grass" had drifted about, always at risk of freezing to death in the frost and snow, and by chance, was taken in by a wealthy family to serve as a servant, later becoming a scribe after being recognized by a hidden tutor in the market, receiving the name Frostfall, thus embarking on the path of cultivation. During this time, it indeed should have learned about many hardships faced by common people. 

But Chen Ping'an didn’t believe its narrative at all. 

Frostfall rubbed its cheeks, "People like me with such a miserable fate in ascended realms are rare, like pitiful worms raised on mud and filth." 

Chen Ping'an nodded, "For a Qi Practitioner of the fifth realm to call an ancestor is indeed unfortunate." 

At the steps, the external celestial demon placed its hands on its waist and said solemnly, "Hidden Official Ancestor, I won’t allow you to bel

 # Chapter 798: On the Edge of a Blade

A ferry from the Central Lands of the Divine Continent docked at the Upside-Down Mountain under the cover of night. However, it did not unload any cargo. Instead, over a hundred Qi Cultivators disembarked, each exhaling long breaths, all accomplished individuals in their own right, adhering strictly to the rules.

At Chunfan Lodge, Nalan Caihuan and Shao Yunyan personally welcomed them, escorting them all the way to the main entrance. These cultivators belonged to the Yin-Yang School and the Mo Family’s Mechanists, but they would not engage in any bloodshed within the city.

They split into several groups, heading towards the Mirage City, the Summer Resort Palace, and the Winter Retreat Palace, as well as a few private residences of sword immortals. Among these was the Elm Fairy Pavilion, whose foundation was built upon a poetic inscription by a sword immortal. Nearby resided several women dressed as sword cultivators, who had received permission from a temporary "Supervising Officer" from the Hidden Officials to leave the forbidden grounds set by their master. 

Three Golden Core sword cultivators were just about to take flight on their swords towards the city wall. After years of being confined by their master, they had only ever practiced swordsmanship, to the point that they had forgotten to ask for appropriate robes to wear. However, they were stopped by a small girl, who wore a bamboo box on her back and had a small inkstone tied at her waist. She informed them that they could only go to the Mirage City and must return to their residence to continue practicing swordsmanship if they did not comply.

Five Yin-Yang cultivators and Mo Family Mechanists, after receiving a geomancy map and a detailed explanation gifted from the Summer Resort Palace, began to decipher the restrictions of this private residence one by one. The door opened smoothly, and soon a luminous mirror inscribed with the phrase “Clear Moon” appeared above the residence. Within the ancient mirror, four auspicious beasts danced around the knob. Once the formation was activated, the surrounding scenery of the residence was illuminated, revealing every detail.

The group responsible for moving the Elm Fairy Pavilion and this residence consisted of foreign cultivators, who stole glances while watching the small girl confront the three Golden Core sword cultivators. She spoke rapidly, like beans pouring from a bamboo tube. Although the foreign cultivators had picked up some dialect from the Sword Qi Great Wall during their journey, they could only grasp the general meaning; her imposing presence completely overwhelmed the three Earth Immortals.

No amount of reasoning or emotional appeals could sway the three Golden Core sword cultivators. One of them, exasperated, shouted, “Guo Zhujiao! Don’t think that just because Lord Hidden Official is your master, we can’t do anything! We three brothers are at least Golden Cores and your seniors on the path of cultivation…”

In truth, the little girl often came here to sneak over the walls, so both sides were quite familiar with each other.

Guo Zhujiao crossed her arms, her expression stern. “If you dare to go to the city wall, my Hidden Official’s flying swords will arrive even faster, and you’ll be thrown back here by a certain sword immortal. You won’t even get to go to the larger Mirage City.”

One of the more composed Golden Core sword cultivators forced a smile and asked, “Is there really no room for negotiation?”

Guo Zhujiao nodded but added, “There is!”

The three Golden Core sword cultivators, along with the onlooking foreign Qi cultivators, were taken aback.

Guo Zhujiao continued, “As long as you don’t go to the city wall, you can ambush any rogue monsters that cross the wall. But you must not die. If one of you dies, the other two will be confined by a certain sword immortal for a hundred years.”

She pointed toward the Mirage City. “With the Executioner and our Hidden Official’s leader, Sword Immortal Mi, here, there’s no need for you small Golden Cores.”

The three sword cultivators exchanged glances and chuckled. It was certainly better than being mere spectators at the Mirage City.

Guo Zhujiao suddenly added, “Just don’t die.”

Three streaks of sword light flashed and vanished.

The foreign Qi cultivators, who were not low in cultivation, felt heavy-hearted and puzzled. 

How could the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall treat their lives and their paths so lightly? While it was not uncommon to die without remorse for the greater good, where were the cultivators who actively sought death when they could avoid it?

Guo Zhujiao turned her gaze back towards the three streaks of sword light, lingering long without pulling her gaze away. 

She feared that, in a moment of impulse, they might rush to the city wall. She thought to herself that if they went, she might as well go with them.

Guo Zhujiao continued to look toward the city wall, secretly searching for her parents' figures, but she could not find them.

Masters, parents, children, partners, ancestors, juniors, friends.

Which sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall lacked a justifiable reason to slay monsters? Many sword cultivators below the level of sword immortals were willing to kill monsters but were averse to dying. The top sword immortals and the Summer Resort Palace no longer insisted on defending the city. They could retreat if they sensed danger, and if things seemed stable, they could return to the city wall. At present, the scholars and virtuous individuals of the Sword Qi Great Wall had already relinquished their positions and the Hidden Officials' flying swords rarely sent messages to the city wall.

Guo Zhujiao turned back with a smile. “You’ve all worked hard, seniors.”

Upon arriving here, the oppressive sword energy was overwhelming, and the foreign Qi cultivators who had initially expressed some grievances found themselves momentarily at a loss for words when faced with the little girl’s sincere gratitude. After all, they had come to earn a few hard-earned coins. But that was not the most important thing; the key was that their actions would be recorded in the academy, earning them a good deed.

At the Winter Retreat Palace, a group of foreign individuals arrived.

With no one left to teach them martial arts, a dozen children now practiced boxing on their own. According to Jiang Yun’s instructions, aside from practicing stances, they engaged in sparring matches, beating each other to their hearts' content.

When the Qi cultivators passed the training ground, all the children stopped their practice, gazing indifferently at the divine beings of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The temporary supervising officer of this place, Sword Cultivator Gu Jianlong, did not bother explaining anything to the children. He was disinclined to do so, and besides, if he were to speak a few words of fairness, it might provoke a fight between the two groups, given the age difference. Gu Jianlong had always believed that even with the Hidden Official present, friends like Lin Junbi and Xuan Shen, and the foreign sword cultivators, the Sword Qi Great Wall remained the Sword Qi Great Wall.

At the sword workshop.

Luo Zhenyi sat on a set of steps, eyes closed, nurturing his flying sword.

A young foreign Golden Core cultivator, busy with his elder’s tasks, mustered the courage to speak to the girl, but before he could say anything, she simply said, “You’ve worked hard,” followed by a “Get lost.”

Two statements, one addressing the situation and the other the person.

At the clothing workshop, Wang Xinshui gazed towards the city wall. An elderly foreign cultivator chuckled and asked, “Young brother, may I inquire about your age and cultivation level? I’m genuinely curious.”

Wang Xinshui responded politely, turning to smile. “In the Sword Qi Great Wall, it is nothing worth mentioning.”

Seeing that the old man did not believe him, Wang Xinshui added, “It’s not a modesty statement.”

The old man laughed. “Being able to speak amicably with you, young brother, is already a pleasant surprise on this journey.”

Wei Wenlong had already returned from the Mirage City to Chunfan Lodge. He spoke of the fierce tactics of the king-level monsters, particularly one named Huang Luan, who seemed to have gone mad, smashing many pavilions and towers into the city wall. The small realms meticulously refined by Huang Luan also concealed numerous Earth Immortal monsters. One of them, a monster sword cultivator who shouted “First to cross the city wall, whoever,” was struck by a sword immortal after a certain observatory was destroyed. He barely managed to cross the city wall and fled onto the city’s great formation, only to be struck down by Mi Yu with a single sword, cleaving him in half along with his Golden Core and Nascent Soul, before casually waving his sleeve and disappearing, a fine display of a sword immortal’s charm.

Nalan Caihuan glanced at Wei Wenlong’s adoring expression and retorted, “No matter how good Mi Yu is at embroidering pillows, he’s still at the Jade Purity realm. Dealing with a heavily injured Nascent Soul is more than enough.”

Shao Yunyan asked with a smile, “Who was that ‘whoever’?”

As for this sword immortal, his real combat power was slightly inferior to Mi Yu, and while Shao Yunyan had a decent reputation in the Upside-Down Mountain, Mi Yu was subjected to mockery from Nalan Caihuan, a mere Nascent Soul cultivator, in the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Wei Wenlong shook his head. “I don’t understand the dialect of the barbarian lands. Afterward, Sword Immortal Mi didn’t reveal the opponent’s name, only saying the phrase ‘First to cross the city wall.’”

Shao Yunyan sighed. “Master Yunjian from the Water Spirit Palace should be visiting soon.”

Nalan Caihuan scoffed. “Lord Hidden Official does have good foresight and means. Only cultivators like Yunjian would not treat their own Jade Purity realm as a top-tier realm. If it were other sects’ elders at the top tier, they wouldn’t be so restricted.”

Shao Yunyan, a gentle man who rarely expressed sharpness, finally went toe-to-toe with Nalan Caihuan today, saying, “Yunjian’s heart of Dao is higher than mine.”

Implying that he, Shao Yunyan, was a sword immortal while she was only a Nascent Soul, naturally, that made him superior.

Nalan Caihuan raised an eyebrow. “What does it matter if one has a higher realm and a higher heart of Dao? When it comes to life and death, can Yunjian escape?”

Shao Yunyan smiled back, slowly saying, “So what? It doesn’t prevent her from having a higher heart of Dao than you.”

Wei Wenlong silently cheered for his master, thinking that this “so what” was truly brilliant.

Nalan Caihuan scoffed, “Shao Sword Immortal has spent little time with Lord Hidden Official, yet you’ve learned seven or eight parts of the essence of conversation.”

Shao Yunyan laughed heartily, “I don’t dare claim that.”

But aside from their light banter, when Wei Wenlong faced the accounts on the table, he unknowingly fell into a daze. 

The Water Spirit Palace, one of the four private residences at the Upside-Down Mountain, remained the only one untouched by the Sword Qi Great Wall, and it seemed to be in constant argument with no conclusion in sight.

First, the sect leader of the Rain Dragon Sect visited the Water Spirit Palace but failed to persuade his junior sister Yunjian to abandon her plans to move north. Naturally, Yunjian could not convince her senior sister either. By the time Yunjian made the decision to make her northward relocation public, the Water Spirit Palace, with its many peaks, was rife with contradictions. It was apparent that many had received secret messages from the Ancestor Hall, leading Yunjian to hit a soft wall. As a Jade Purity realm immortal, Yunjian returned to her home peak at the Rain Dragon Sect, only to find dissent among many disciples, especially her direct disciple who had become Dao companions with Fu Ke. She was resolute, stating she wouldn’t leave the Rain Dragon Sect, even if it meant betraying her master’s kindness. This caused Yunjian to grow increasingly weary.

Yunjian could only hide her tracks and quietly visit Chunfan Lodge, taking a seat in the conference hall, where she met Sword Immortal Shao Yunyan and Nalan Caihuan, a Nascent Soul sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Yunjian was indeed not adept at dealing with others. Arriving with a heavy heart, once seated, she didn’t know how to begin.

Shao Yunyan, unwilling to let the Rain Dragon Sect’s ancestor feel too uncomfortable, took the initiative to say, “Isn’t the Ancestor Hall of the Rain Dragon Sect considering that even if the Sword Qi Great Wall cannot hold, it wouldn’t be too hasty to discuss retreating and relocating later on? After all, the ancestral home of the Rain Dragon Sect is quite a distance from the Upside-Down Mountain. If the situation becomes dire, it wouldn’t be too difficult to gather some important belongings and packages to leave, just like those in the Jianghu. Furthermore, gathering important items and your sect leader’s hidden treasures would be sufficient to ensure the survival of the sect.”

Yunjian nodded lightly, maintaining her silence.

Shao Yunyan continued, “However, if you move now and disrupt the mountain’s foundational water flow, tearing down the grand formation, it would be difficult to restore it later. In any case, there are many difficulties and it’s not worth it to relocate; it’s best to observe the changes. This is what the Ancestor Hall of the Rain Dragon Sect has thoughtfully decided.”

Nalan Caihuan suddenly spoke up, “Shao Sword Immortal underestimates the Rain Dragon Sect’s business acumen. They’ve already begun secretly buying up shopfronts and properties in the Upside-Down Mountain. Well, many who initially wanted to abandon their ancestral businesses are now unwilling to sell.”

Shao Yunyan glanced at Nalan Caihuan, who leaned back against her chair, indicating to him to allow her to remain silent from here on out.

In truth, this wasn’t even harsh language; she hadn’t even uttered the truly piercing words. For example, it was clear that there were influential figures within the Rain Dragon Sect, not just one or two, who were looking to make a larger profit during these turbulent times. It wasn’t just about a piece of land that Yunjian couldn’t shamelessly seize; there were opportunities to carve out a large territory in Tongyezhou as a branch sect.

Shao Yunyan remarked, “At present, it seems that the ancestral home of the Rain Dragon Sect clearly won’t be moving north. The reason there aren’t many sect cultivators willing to follow Yunjian Daoist is not due to their short-sightedness, but rather their shrewd calculations. First, the cultivators who follow Daoist Yunjian northward will all bear the suspicion of splitting the Rain Dragon Sect. Once the Ancestor Hall is enraged, your senior sister can directly issue an order to expel them from the sect and reduce them to a group of mountain and wild cultivators. This is a very real danger close at hand.”

“Secondly, even if they take the risk and move north, where exactly would they go? Where can they find a spirit-rich island like the Rain Dragon Sect’s ancestral home? Would they need to rent land from others? When have the Rain Dragon Sect’s cultivators ever needed to depend on others? If they casually find a place with thin spiritual energy for cultivation, how many years would it set back the future paths of those cultivators who moved north?”

“Lastly, even if they find a barely suitable overseas immortal island, the expenses for building a residence, creating a great formation, and the required rare materials for cultivation would be astronomical. Yunjian Daoist is famously poor at managing finances and has limited resources. Moreover, Yunjian Daoist is known for her ascetic lifestyle and doesn’t enjoy socializing, so her connections are weak. Following such a great cultivator who possesses only the realm and not the means to make a living and wandering away from home is hardly a wise decision.”

Yunjian remained speechless, even sparing the effort to nod.

Nalan Caihuan finally spoke up, “What should we do then?”

Shao Yunyan rubbed his forehead, recognizing that if it were an ordinary top-tier cultivator, they would have stormed away in frustration by now.

Nalan Caihuan glanced at the indecisive upper-tier female cultivator and asked, “Yunjian, how many people can you bring with you?”

Yunjian replied, “Sixty-two people, including three Earth Immortals.”

Nalan Caihuan queried, “That many?”

Yunjian felt embarrassed.

She mistakenly thought that Nalan Caihuan was mocking her again.

Nalan Caihuan abruptly said, “I can lend you all the immortal money I’ve accumulated.”

Shao Yunyan was greatly surprised; it was unexpected for Nalan Caihuan to lend money to Yunjian.

Yunjian was puzzled. “Why would you do that?”

Nalan Caihuan explained, “When the world is in chaos, money on the mountain loses its value, but money in the mountains is worth more. I only have one request.”

Yunjian nodded. “Please, go ahead.”

Nalan Caihuan continued, “If you, Yunjian, one day leave the Rain Dragon Sect and establish your own sect, I will become the sect leader. Rest assured, by then, I will certainly be a sword immortal. If not, and you still cling to your identity as a Rain Dragon Sect cultivator, you will repay the money according to the mountain’s rules after a hundred years.”

Yunjian pondered briefly and nodded. “Then it’s settled!”

Finally, she displayed a bit of the determination expected from a top-tier cultivator.

Shao Yunyan knew that cultivators like Yunjian were naturally suited to sit in high positions but could not be sect leaders.

Nalan Caihuan turned to smile at Shao Yunyan. “If there’s an opportunity, how about becoming the chief supporter?”

Without hesitation, Shao Yunyan replied, “Sure.”

This bond formed at Chunfan Lodge with Nalan Caihuan was anything but ordinary. Shao Yunyan was already a sword immortal with a wide circle of friends, and while Nalan Caihuan was overly shrewd in business and lacked some integrity, she would indeed need someone like her to manage affairs if she were to establish a sect in the Sword Qi Great Wall in the future.

Yunjian felt a sense of relief.

Shao Yunyan had a great reputation at the Upside-Down Mountain. He could not simply be regarded as a Jade Purity realm sword immortal.

Moreover, in times of life and death, one’s true character shines through. Since Chunfan Lodge was willing to be so close to the Sword Qi Great Wall, Shao Yunyan’s true nature was laid bare. Compared to the profit-driven Nalan Caihuan, Yunjian actually trusted Shao Yunyan more in her heart.

Nalan Caihuan said, “I’ve completed my business. Brother Yunyan, you can continue discussing matters.”

Shao Yunyan, unconcerned about Nalan Caihuan’s name change, said to Yunjian, “Lord Hidden Official mentioned that if you encounter obstacles in moving north, there’s a compromise. You can make another trip to the Rain Dragon Sect’s Ancestor Hall, expressing your willingness to personally lead a group of sect disciples on a journey that will take about five years, and then seek a sum of money from your senior sister for the trip, of course, not too much. Besides visiting the Dragon’s Vein Ravine, there are many immortal secret realms to explore, such as Luohua Island and the Creation Cave, where Nascent Soul Qi cultivators can follow along. Furthermore, there will be visits to the Resting Dragon Stone and other places.”

As Shao Yunyan spoke, he smiled, “Lord Hidden Official originally thought you could only take thirty people. Who would have thought it would double, causing a bit of a headache. If sixty-two people leave the Rain Dragon Sect and the Water Spirit Palace together, your senior sister and the entire Ancestor Hall will undoubtedly lose face.”

Yunjian fell into another dilemma.

Nalan Caihuan, unable to bear Yunjian’s naivete any longer, remarked, “What’s the difficulty? You just need to reflect and repent at the Ancestor Hall, saying you’ve abandoned the absurd idea of moving north, and wish to make amends by fulfilling your responsibilities to your sect’s disciples. Then let those who were willing to follow you northward find some appealing reasons to take the intercontinental ferries from the Poshang and Baoping Islands, claiming to go on a journey to visit friends. Just remember to have them leave in batches, discreetly, without attracting attention. Otherwise, with your senior sister’s temperament, once you lead the team on a journey, she could easily imprison them secretly.”

Yunjian nodded lightly.

After settling the hundred-year agreement, Nalan Caihuan looked at Yunjian’s naive and bewildered demeanor and suddenly found her cute. Such a nonchalant great cultivator was less likely to bring trouble to a sect leader. In the immortal mountain ranges of the Sword Qi Great Wall, many sects had fallen to ruin through the actions of their own members. For instance, when a cultivator’s realm ascended to the pinnacle of their sect, ambition could blind them, leading to factional struggles.

Shao Yunyan said, “Mobilizing forces, tearing down houses, and relocating north are merely stopgap measures. The three matters I mentioned earlier were already concerns for Lord Hidden Official. At that time, neither of us had expressed our intentions openly, worrying that Yunjian Daoist might misinterpret our goals. In essence, we only sought to assist you, Yunjian Daoist, in leaving some seeds of cultivation for the Rain Dragon Sect. However, Lord Hidden Official candidly stated that there are no good strategies for relocating; we could only strive to avoid unfavorable outcomes. The next things I mention are what I hope you, Yunjian Daoist, will consider carefully. The so-called journey is merely a pretense; abandoning the northward relocation is the true goal. This way, the Rain Dragon Sect can be at ease in letting you go.”

Shao Yunyan sighed at this point.

Yunjian’s expression was focused. “I implore Sword Immortal Shao to enlighten me.”

Shao Yunyan smiled. “After your travels to Luohua Island and the Creation Cave, you will continue eastward, eventually landing at Tongyezhou. Previously, Lord Hidden Official wrote in the letter, ‘The firewood is in the green hills,’ implying that as long as the green hills remain, there is no worry about firewood. There’s also a deeper meaning that the firewood is on the green hills and not in the water. Afterward, you, Yunjian Daoist, and your disciples will have three choices. The first is to seek out the Great Lord of Taiping Mountain and say that you are friends with ‘Chen Pingan.’”

“Then, you would head north, landing at Old Dragon City, and seek out Fan Junmao of Southern Mount in Baopingzhou, as the Great Liyang Song family is currently digging a great canal. The Rain Dragon Sect’s cultivators are well-versed in water techniques, which can help cultivate their paths while accumulating goodwill. If this matter is accomplished, you can continue your journey northward to Baopingzhou, crossing at the Niujiao Mountain ferry, proceeding to the Bone Marsh, and then taking the Chunlupu ferry. Your destination will be the small Dragon Palace cave heaven in the central area of North Julu, which is jointly owned by the Water Dragon Sect, the Floating Duck Lake, and the Yang family of Yunxia Palace. Among those, the waters of the great canal are stewarded by Li Yuan and the Southern Xun Water Hall’s Madame Shen Lin, both of whom are friends of Lord Hidden Official. You may take residence at one of the Wu Water Islands for cultivation. Even if you borrow it for a hundred years, it would be acceptable. As for where you, Yunjian Daoist, ultimately wish to settle—whether it’s to affiliate with Taiping Mountain or establish a residence by the great canal of Baopingzhou, or remain in the rich waters of the Dragon Palace cave heaven—all depends on fate.”

Shao Yunyan paused for a moment, then said solemnly, “Lord Hidden Official once mentioned that this journey will inevitably be fraught with challenges, and it certainly won’t be smooth sailing. You must pay attention to the emotional changes of your disciples and offer guidance.”

Yunjian glanced at the chair at the head of the conference hall and asked, “I have one last question. I implore Sword Immortal Shao and Daoist Nalan to explain why that Hidden Official is willing to act this way?”

Shao Yunyan chuckled knowingly. “To be honest, I am also curious. Lord Hidden Official’s impression of the Rain Dragon Sect is… quite average.”

Nalan Caihuan spoke frankly, “I dare assert that he is helping others but also helping himself. A young person without enemies cannot achieve such accomplishments and possess such a heart of Dao today!”

Shao Yunyan joked, “Luckily, Wenlong isn’t the type to complain, and Mi Yu is used to being bullied by you. Otherwise, with Lord Hidden Official’s small-mindedness, heh.”

Nalan Caihuan suddenly fixed her gaze on Yunjian.

Yunjian was at a loss for why she would say that.

Nalan Caihuan chuckled, “Your Rain Dragon Sect has many female cultivators.”

Yunjian didn’t understand the basis for her statement.

Nalan Caihuan continued to amuse herself. “Fortunately, Lord Hidden Official, regardless of anything else, has always treated women with respect and distance. The more beautiful they are, the more he avoids them.”

Shao Yunyan, unwilling to let Nalan Caihuan continue with her unfounded remarks, stood up, cupping his fists. “I wish you, Daoist Yunjian, a smooth journey.”

Yunjian stood and returned the gesture, saying, “The kindness of Sword Immortal Shao’s planning and Daoist Nalan’s lending is remembered in my heart.”

After Yunjian left.

Nalan Caihuan and Shao Yunyan walked towards the account room together, and she asked, “Do you know how things are going with Chen Pingan back in his hometown?”

Shao Yunyan shook his head.

He was contemplating one thing: according to the young Hidden Official’s predictions, the likelihood of Yunjian and the Rain Dragon Sect’s cultivators ultimately choosing Tongyezhou was seemingly the smallest, yet in reality, it was the greatest.

The reasoning was simple. Tongyezhou, as a whole, was likely to be shattered, and most immortal forces would be lost. However, the other two islands would still be traversed by Yunjian first.

Nalan Caihuan laughed angrily. “I am neither friend nor foe with Chen Pingan; what you say will not kill me. Don’t forget, we may end up being part of the same mountain in the future.”

Shao Yunyan smiled. “Whether to be friends with Chen Pingan is a matter of personal preference, but as for being enemies, I think we can skip that.”

Shao Yunyan indeed knew quite a bit about Chen Pingan.

Because Shao Yunyan would follow Lu Zhi and Madam Tuo Yan to Southern Poshang Island, and Chen Pingan hoped that once Shao Yunyan arrived there, he would meet Liu Xianyang. Moreover, his direct disciple Wei Wenlong had already been firmly established as a supporter of the Fallen Rock Mountain, so both sides were quite honest with each other. During Chen Pingan’s last visit to Chunfan Lodge, he had shared more insider information about his hometown.

The young Hidden Official, residing in the vast territory of the Great Liyang Dynasty, raised the matter of seeking swords with Zhengyang Mountain. Once one side tore the veil, the Fallen Rock Mountain would become an enemy everywhere, nowhere to hide, and the Zhi Color Peak’s Ancestor Hall could not be moved.

However, if one were to expand the chessboard, Baopingzhou lay between North Julu and Tongyezhou. North Julu had the Bone Marsh and the Pi Ma Sect, the Tai Hui Sword Sect, the Floating Duck Lake, and Chunlupu, among others, while Tongyezhou was presided over by Jiang Shangzhen of the Yu Gui Sect and the Taiping Mountain, which had a promising connection.

The Song family of the Great Liyang had already immersed themselves in achievements and knowledge for over a hundred years, so they would naturally calculate this account carefully, considering the specific gains and losses, deciding whether it was worth acting as a talisman for a Zhengyang Mountain.

Liu Xianyang’s way of seeking swords was certainly viable.

Yet in the depths of Chen Pingan’s heart, he hoped that the mountain-moving ape would one day be hunted down by Zhengyang Mountain’s own hands.

At that time, he would only need to sit in the Ancestor Hall of Zhengyang Mountain, being treated as a guest of honor by a group of so-called sword cultivators. He could drink tea and wine freely, while watching that mountain-moving ape fall into disfavor and isolation.

Seeking swords in his heart.

Of course, directly climbing Zhengyang Mountain to seek swords and behead the mountain-moving ape to throw its head into the Ancestor Hall would also be a satisfying task.

“I won’t lose anything; you can do as you please.”

Arriving at the door of the account room, Nalan Caihuan suddenly said, “Looking at Yunjian’s retreat arrangements, Shao Yunyan, are you afraid?”

Shao Yunyan smiled. “Afraid? Afraid of what?”

Nalan Caihuan shook her head. “It’s nothing.”

---

Above the city wall, Lu Zhi overlooked the battlefield below, where the monsters were clustered like an anthill. This female sword immortal was recuperating, with half her face bloodied and disfigured, too preoccupied by the stalemate of the battle to care.

Moreover, Lu Zhi had never been concerned about her appearance.

Having ventured too far from the city, she had been struck by a powerful technique from the great monster, Heavy Light, as well as a flying sword from Sword Immortal Shouchen.

However, at this moment, within the world’s largest anthill, a tidal wave surged towards the south.

With the flying sword at the forefront, thousands of sword cultivators followed.

On the edge of a blade, the flying sword collided with the monsters first.

Countless monsters were instantly sent flying, splattering limbs and remains everywhere.

This was the sword formation led by the great sword immortals Nalan Shaowei, Yue Qing, and Mi Hu. Those willing to venture out of the city could unleash their swords without restraint.

In the distance stood A Liang, Chen Xi, and Qi Tingji, sword immortals inscribing characters on the city wall, each occupying a corner of the battlefield, forming a triangular formation.

Among them, after Qi Tingji exerted his full strength, each sword energy release left a clearing within a hundred-zhang radius, only to be swarmed by countless monsters.

Aside from the great monsters Huang Luan, Yang Zhi, and Bai Ying, who were responsible for disrupting the city wall, they would occasionally engage in battles with A Liang and the others, with other king-level monsters joining in from time to time.

High above, Dong Sangeng battled a king-level monster that had refined half of the moon spirit, using a great moon as the battlefield, fighting fiercely for an extended period.

Looking up, a clear thin black line was visible on the massive round moon.

From such a distance, one could still see the traces; if one were to enter the great moon, they would need to ride their sword to travel far and witness the sword scars on both ends.

That was the result of a sword strike from Dong Sangeng earlier.

Although Old Deaf was a monster, he was far more straightforward in killing monsters than many sword immortals, combining his massive true form with an imposing Dharma aspect through a unique secret technique, specifically tearing apart the heads and limbs of those colossal monsters, then hurling them as flying swords toward the southern battlefield.

The three teachings’ saints, the old Taoist’s robe, depicted an ancient map of the great mountains, far more than just five peaks.

The old man held a Dao artifact of the Immortal Treasure Realm in the clouds, which was as vast as a giant lake, reflecting scorched earth wherever its light reached.

The Confucian saint took out a scroll of the “Yellow River’s Giant Crossing” from his sleeve, aligning his fingers, gently brushing it open, and the long scroll unfurled, falling from the city wall, suspended between heaven and earth. The waters of the Yellow River come from the sky, crashing the monsters that clung to the city back down to the ground, drowning them in a flood, leaving countless skeletons in an instant.

The bloodied Buddhist saint, covered in golden blood, condensed into ten golden dragons.

This monk severed his fingers, using them as spines for the golden dragons, and with the blood from the severed fingers, he illuminated their eyes.

After severing all ten fingers, the monk clasped his hands gently, bowed his head slightly, and chanted a Buddhist verse.

On the battlefield, Li Cai was fighting alone, sword in hand, surrounded by monsters and magical techniques.

How could he keep killing endlessly? 

Kill again!

If I were to die here today, Jiang Shangzhen, you heartless bastard, remember to shed a few tears when that time comes, just for show!

Thousands of sword cultivators left the city wall, forming a tidal wave formation as the battlefield advanced continuously. Originally a straight line, it gradually became sparse and distorted.

A young sword cultivator named Chen Li followed that line of sword energy, weaving through the battlefield with ease, not lingering in battles, killing those monsters that were injured yet not dead with a single strike. If one strike failed, he would never entangle himself.

The young Chen Li wielded a dull sword, his innate flying sword called “Wu Mi.” That sword was a relic from a sword immortal, and when combined with the flying sword Wu Mi, it could create a miniature celestial realm. Though merely at the Sea Viewing realm, in the heat of battle, he was extraordinarily clever, adept in strategy, and had an almost instinctual grasp of the battlefield dynamics, taking advantage of opportunities and avoiding dangers. He also enjoyed frantically picking up spoils on the battlefield, darting about until he spotted treasure; he was the kind who prioritized wealth over life, earning him the nickname “Little Hidden Official.”

The boy had once left behind bold words on a signboard at that tavern, “The Hundred-Year Sword Immortal, within reach.”

As Chen Li slashed down a hefty monster, he simultaneously ran while wiping the blood from his face. With a roll, he dodged a flying sword from a hidden monster sword cultivator, while controlling his flying sword Wu Mi to fly straight ahead, both avoiding the opponent’s sword without any intent to pursue.

An elderly Golden Core sword cultivator, surrounded by monsters, had nearly lost his sword-holding arm to a monster’s axe, but unexpectedly, a wooden-clad young swordsman intervened, effortlessly severing the head of that monster cultivator. The Golden Core sword cultivator expressed his gratitude, although he had been struck by an axe, it wouldn’t be fatal. However, losing an arm on the battlefield meant he had to retreat for the time being. To his surprise, that sword cultivator tore off his disguise, revealing a faint smile. The Golden Core sword cultivator was stunned, then burst into laughter, “You rascal, the two-palm shopkeeper!” Soon, a sharp pain gripped his heart as the “young hidden official” pierced his heart with a sword energy, shattering the elder’s Golden Core. The figure quickly covered his face again and vanished into another area of the battlefield.

Amidst resting and recuperating, Wei Jin from the Snowy Temple immediately stood up, riding his sword away.

This person was deadly serious.

Otherwise, the future would be endless troubles.

He shared a similar approach to Chen Pingan and Shouchen, both being extremely decisive. Capable of self-preservation while possessing sufficient killing power, having both qualities made strategy and means meaningful. Otherwise, it would be better to strike straightforwardly and directly.

In the heart of the battlefield, a large armored figure rode a steed, holding a long spear that had impaled three sword cultivators.

This great monster, gripping the reins with one hand, spun the horse in place, while the burly armored figure, whose face was obscured by a mask, seemed to be patiently waiting for the sword immortals.

A young sword cultivator was struck down by a monster with a human head and monkey body, its fists hammering through his chest and causing him to plummet, only to have his head crushed underfoot by the monster. The moment the monster lifted its head, it was met with a sword light that exploded its head from afar.

A young female sword cultivator, whose innate flying sword had been shattered, retreated unsteadily. Just as she was caught by a monster rushing from the side, it struck her neck with a fist, tearing off her arm. The monster then chewed on her severed arm, gesturing to the two sword cultivators nearby to rescue her. The girl, covered in blood and struggling to see, glanced at the boys she had grown up with in the distance and then grabbed a broken weapon nearby, stabbing it into her heart.

The monster frowned, discarding the half-chewed arm, and was about to attack those two young sword cultivators when suddenly a punch crushed its body to pieces.

Even in death, it never witnessed the face of that martial woman, only knowing she was a seemingly inconspicuous frail old woman.

At the entrance of the account room, an old man in gray wore a calm expression as he gazed at the battlefield.

Standing beside the old man was the bearded Liu Cha, who asked, “Are we just going to allow the Sword Qi Great Wall to drag this out? Since the opponent has no intention of retreating to the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Qingdu clearly intends to abandon the Sword Qi Great Wall while leaving behind a significant number of sword cultivators as seeds.”

The old man in gray chuckled. “Abandon the Sword Qi Great Wall? I would gladly allow it, as long as they leave me this entire Sword Qi Great Wall. Let those sword cultivators go wherever they please; as long as they retreat from here to the Upside-Down Mountain, with the virtue of those Qi cultivators in the Sword Qi Great Wall, they might not even need us to intervene. They could end up fighting each other in the southern Poshang, Fuyun, and Tongyezhou. Unfortunately, Chen Qingdu isn’t foolish. Otherwise, if the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall retreat today, the next day, the southern Poshang would retreat, and the day after that, Tongyezhou and Fuyun would follow suit. They might as well retreat back to the Central Lands of the Divine Continent without obstruction.”

Liu Cha said, “According to the messages from the dead soldiers who crossed the city wall, the Sword Qi Great Wall has deployed a significant number of Yin-Yang cultivators and Mo Family Mechanists, intending to elevate the entire city.”

The gray-clad old man nodded. “In that case, it’s a bit troublesome. Based solely on the foundation of the Sword Qi Great Wall’s formations, even with the Mirage City serving as the spearhead of the heavenly sword, and with the help of those sword immortal residences, it still wouldn’t be able to lift the entire city.”

The old man chuckled, “Chen Qingdu’s behavior, would you consider that desperate?”

Liu Cha fell silent.

At the Upside-Down Mountain, the young innkeeper at the Stork’s Nest sat at the door, basking in the sun year after year, finding no new excitement, yet it was still better than being battered by wind and rain.

At the old gate, the young Taoist boy continued to flip through books while the sword-wielding man squatted nearby, grumbling about how fast the boy was flipping the pages.

When the Great Heavenly Lord emerged from seclusion, he received a decree from his master.

The Sword Respect Pavilion had long closed its doors, while the shop at Mi Lu Cliff was still open, albeit desolate and quiet. The Lingzhi Workshop was nearly empty, and the Captive and Release Pavilion no longer saw bustling crowds.

Most of the Rain Dragon Sect’s cultivators still believed that the sky would not fall.

The children of Luohua Island were still pestering the old man with questions about the extraordinary individuals on land.

In the Fifth World, an old scholar urged the most accomplished student in the world to draw his sword more decisively, more forcefully, embodying the spirit of a sword immortal.

At the highest point of Bai Yu Jing in the Azure Underworld, a young Taoist who had just returned from traveling leisurely walked along the railing, cradling a pile of scrolls in his arms. They were all celestial paintings scraped together from various places. Once unfurled, they would immerse him in a spring dream, bursting with colors, featuring women partially veiling their faces with silk fans. There were images of summer relaxation, with a small yellow cat curled up on a rock enjoying the cool. There was also a painting with much blank space depicting a lone boat fishing against the cold river snow, a solitary figure casting a line alongside a straw-coated elder. There were also scenes of a literati in a green robe observing lumberjacks at Taiping Mountain.

In Baopingzhou, at the Ancestor Hall of Fallen Rock Mountain, ripples stirred as a tall woman in white suddenly appeared.

On the peak of the Cloud-Drifting Mountain, the great mountain lord Wei Bo feigned ignorance, closing his eyes once more.

In the backyard of the town’s pharmacy, Old Yang was puffing out clouds of smoke.

In the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Pingan, having restrained the innate divine ability of the caged bird, held a bloodied head of a monster sword cultivator. A golden whirlpool appeared where the sword had pierced his heart, yet there were no traces of injury or blood.

Nianxin began preparing to sew, reminding him to be cautious this time as the stitching of his true name was of great importance.

Frostfall squatted nearby, asking the young man who sat cross-legged with his bare back exposed, “Since you are a scholar, Hidden Official, do you have an innate character?”

*End of Chapter*

 ### Chapter 799: Where the Sword Does Not Inquire

In the Wind and Snow Temple, the Sword Immortal Wei Jin had finally traced the whereabouts of the green-clad swordsman. However, he was suddenly confronted by a handsome young lord, elegantly adorned with a sword nurturing gourd at his waist. With a swift motion, the young man raised his palm, blocking all of Wei Jin's sword light. He shook his wrist, revealing that his palm, which had turned to charcoal, instantly returned to normal.

This imposing figure, neither too high nor too low in the ancient well, was known as Qinghua.

His exquisitely charming face, captivating to women, was a patchwork of others' features meticulously combined. Inside the gourd, countless remnants of Sword Immortals' souls and broken flying swords were contained.

The great demon Qinghua chuckled at the young swordsman, the first among the hundred sword immortals of the Wildlands, behind him: “Little junior brother, have you had enough fun?”

The green-clad swordsman nodded, “You take care of yourself.”

Qinghua again blocked a distant strike from the Sword Immortal, as Wei Jin launched two successive attacks that surged past him. Qinghua had already been suspended above a massive pit, his voice soft and smiling, “What does my senior brother need to be cautious about? Haven't we yet gone to find Chen Qingdu?”

At that moment, Lu Zhi arrived riding his sword and spoke to Wei Jin: “Continue your pursuit. This effeminate one is mine to handle.”

Qinghua turned to gaze at the scarred face of the female Sword Immortal, “Is this the legendary Lu Da Jianxian from the Sword Qi Great Wall, renowned for her beauty?”

Lu Zhi did not respond verbally, but answered with a sword strike.

On one end of the city wall, a blood-covered monk stood like a golden Buddha, with the Sword Qi Great Wall as his lotus seat.

The middle-aged saint of the Buddhist sect, whose robe had fallen away, gently lifted it into the air with a hand that lacked fingers, causing it to expand like a sea of clouds. In an instant, winds whipped and clouds surged, the robe growing larger and radiating Buddhist light that illuminated the world.

Ultimately, that robe, immense enough to obscure the sun and glowing with brilliant colors, descended and enveloped the battlefield outside the city wall, transforming into countless particles of golden light that attached themselves to the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The monk sat cross-legged, and a lotus lamp appeared before him, with a stick of incense burning.

Then, within the timeframe of a single stick of incense, the numerous wounds of the sword cultivators on the battlefield were transferred onto the monk.

In the record of the Sword Immortal's seal, there was an inscription that the young hidden official had copied from the realm of Haoran.

“Buddha of Steady Light descends into the mundane world.”

As the incense was about to burn out, the monk joined his palms in prayer and gazed upward with a smile, passing away unexpectedly.

Yet the light from the lamp before him continued to shine, even brighter than before.

The three saints, including the monk, had been engaged in battle the entire time.

For instance, this Buddhist saint consumed his own life force to alter the heavens and assist the Sword Qi Great Wall in overcoming the Wildlands, collaborating with the other two saints to create a golden river thrice, shaking off the lion’s bugs and severing ten fingers to transform into a golden dragon, shedding his robe to protect the sword cultivators…

Amid the horrific slaughter of the siege, where blood flowed like rivers, along with the Confucian saint's grand diagram of the Yellow River, the crucial Buddhist powers enveloped the battlefield.

Having nurtured his sword for too long, Wu Chengpei finally felt it was time to unleash his life’s sword, the “Ganyin.”

This sword was ranked among the top three in the Sword Spirit Assessment of the Summer Palace.

On the battlefield outside the city wall, thousands of demons were shrouded in a torrential downpour of blood that surged from the earth, instantly stripping flesh and bone. Each droplet, infused with the essence of the sword, slaughtered souls.

The great demon Bai Ying's throne was positioned foremost, but there was still some distance from the battlefields of A Liang, Chen Xi, and Qi Tingji.

Perched atop a throne of dried bones, constructed from hundreds of thousands of skulls, this great demon was devoid of flesh, his white bones shining like jade, yet he still stood upon a severed head.

Upon witnessing Wu Chengpei summon his life sword from the city wall, Bai Ying kicked the head away, stood up, and with great interest, gazed at the descending rain curtain.

Bai Ying's gaze drifted slightly, and on the battlefield, a pitiful little Jade Purity realm sword cultivator had lost an arm and was wielding his sword with one hand. Not only that, but his ankle had also been cleanly severed. Nonetheless, he seemed oblivious to his plight as he navigated through the three sword formations created by Qi Tingji and the others, heading straight toward the throne.

The man halted, facing the throne of bones, raising his long sword. Yet, he did not look at the great demon Bai Ying but fixed his gaze intently on the severed head, declaring, “From the lineage of Dragon Monarch, the sword cultivator Gao Kui, with this final sword, I seek to question the ancestor.”

Bai Ying glanced at the head on the ground and laughed heartily, “I think not. A single slap could easily take you down, allowing your disciples to keep you company in death.”

An empty, gray robe floated down, gently landing upon the throne of bones.

As it appeared, Bai Ying immediately returned to his seat, no longer daring to utter a word.

The gray robe stood at the edge of the throne.

Before them was the young master who was determined to inquire about his final sword.

A hoarse voice rang out, “The Dragon Monarch leads the sword.”

The two thrones of great demons hovered near each other, both resembling women.

The great demon Yang Zhi revealed her true form, her body a dragon with a human head, wearing an imperial crown and draped in a black dragon robe, seated upon a dragon chair with a massive dragon tail trailing on the ground.

Beside her, the great demon known as Fiery Concubine did not reveal her true form. With a youthful appearance and crimson eyes, her robe was woven with thousands of threads, each representing a river she had refined. On her wrist was a bracelet made from the essence of dragon pearls, and her shoes were embroidered, with large black pearls adorning the tips.

Yang Zhi had just retreated from the battlefield and had taken a heavy blow from Qi Tingji’s sword, thus she had to reveal her true form to heal.

In the cultivation of demons, transforming into human form expedited ascension, but for healing, it was necessary to revert to their true form for quicker recovery.

Yang Zhi's expression darkened as she stared at Qi Tingji, who occupied a vast battlefield all by himself. This old sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall bore the appearance of a handsome young man. According to the early predictions from Tuo Yue Mountain, Qi Tingji had a lofty ambition and would not willingly accept death, intending to follow the hidden official Xiao Xian in betraying the Sword Qi Great Wall. At a critical moment, he could deliver a treacherous strike against a certain great sword immortal, similar to how Xiao Xian had struck at his back.

Unexpectedly, Qi Tingji had changed his mind. Logically, this should not have happened. As long as Qi Tingji was willing to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, only Chen Qingdu could kill him. But once Chen Qingdu chose to strike, the Tuo Yue Mountain’s ancient ancestor would also act, just as he had stood by during the battle at the Jiazi account.

The only explanation was that Chen Qingdu had offered Qi Tingji a better path to enlightenment.

Fiery Concubine hovered beside the dragon chair. Compared to the great demon Yang Zhi, she appeared diminutive. She glanced at the two young men standing on the armrest of the dragon chair and smiled slightly at one of them, then spoke to Yang Zhi in her mind: “You have failed to command the troops well. Do you not feel guilty? Look at Huang Luan; she knows how to be tactful.”

Yang Zhi's expression grew increasingly grim, the massive tail trailing behind her lightly struck the ground, sending tremors across a hundred-foot radius.

Her situation with Huang Luan was currently most dire.

Yang Zhi had once been the sovereign of the Falling River, so there naturally existed a conflict of interests between her and Fiery Concubine. However, under the witness of Tuo Yue Mountain, Yang Zhi had gifted the entire Falling River region to Fiery Concubine.

In exchange, Fiery Concubine needed to assist Yang Zhi in becoming the co-sovereign of the nine continents of Haoran, allowing Yang Zhi to become the mistress of all earthly kings, with authority over the five sacred peaks, earthly incense, life and death of deities, and the flow of martial fortune, all to be dictated by Yang Zhi's words.

Moreover, Yang Zhi also needed to help Fiery Concubine fulfill her greatest wish, which was to devour the last vestige of a true dragon, thus completing her path to enlightenment, allowing all waterway control in the Wildlands and Haoran to fall under Fiery Concubine’s command.

Thus, the two parties transitioned from a life-and-death conflict in the Wildlands to a future of mutual assistance and alliance.

Atop the massive armrest of the dragon chair stood two sword cultivators from the Jiazi account, Yu Si and the young Tan.

Yu Si had only discovered after the ambush that Tan was indeed Yang Zhi's direct disciple.

Tan also just learned that Yu Si was referred to as “young master” by the great demon Fiery Concubine.

After that, the atmosphere in the Jiazi account became somewhat strange.

Except for the wooden clogs, the other colleagues found it increasingly difficult to engage with them calmly. The gazes directed at them were laced with an unmistakable, hard-to-hide fear.

Thus, today, the two sword cultivators had come to this place for a little respite.

Tan remarked, “It seems there has been no sign of Chen Ping'an.”

Yu Si nodded, “That makes it difficult to avenge Liu Bai.”

Dressed in a black robe, Yu Si wore a white ribbon to tie back his hair, creating a striking contrast that made him appear brisk and handsome.

Tan's expression turned somber, “Sister Liu Bai has changed her body; her sword heart is somewhat unstable.”

Kneeling on one knee, Yu Si gazed toward the distant battlefield, “If it were me, I too would find it hard to maintain a clear sword heart.”

Tan gritted his teeth, “I will kill Chen Ping'an!”

Yu Si smiled, “Count me in.”

He turned his gaze to the great demon Fiery Concubine.

She smiled, “Once the rickety fence is broken, I will help find that young hidden official for you.”

Yang Zhi hesitated for a long time, glancing at the city wall where the Confucian saint had summoned the grand diagram of the Yellow River, causing continuous torrents of water to pour onto the battlefield, blocking the demon’s ant-like siege.

She took out a scroll from her sleeve with reluctance.

As the former sovereign of the Falling River, before relinquishing control over that domain, she had first refined three rivers spanning thousands of miles, one of which was the Uncertain River, swarming with bone demons.

Yang Zhi tossed the scroll toward the Sword Qi Great Wall, dodging several flying swords from the sword cultivators. It fell to the ground, and a torrent of the Uncertain River collided with the Yellow River, instantly stirring up waves.

In the preceding battles, the great demon Yao Jia, who had never intervened, lifted his gaze toward the ancient Daoist from the Azure Heaven who was said to be the master of one of the twelve cities in the Baiyu Capital.

The great demon Yao Jia stood upon a mountain that seemed to be hanging upside down, its platform smooth as a mirror, shining brilliantly.

This shattered mountain was compared in size to the mountain seal left in Haoran and was hailed as the Golden Throne of the Wildlands.

Crafted from countless fragments of historical mountains and water deities, it required iron chains made from demon bones to connect these various shards of golden stone, with the surface of the platform resembling the largest golden coin in the world.

Clad in a golden robe, the great demon Yao Jia, within this throne, did not intentionally employ illusions but was still enveloped in light as if overshadowed by the sun, his true form concealed.

Yao Jia, positioned at the center of the mirrored platform, swiftly navigated the mountain beneath him toward the battlefield, directly confronting the overwhelming power of the sun reflected from the old Daoist holding the multi-treasure mirror.

Previously, the old Daoist had utilized the multi-treasure mirror to connect with the sun of the Wildlands, targeting a demon soldier from the Jade Purity realm, burning away its resilient form while employing immobilization techniques. Ultimately, it was the top ten peak sword immortal candidate, Yue Qing, who severed the demon's head with the treasured sword “Xiong Zhen Wu Yue,” pulverizing its body and restraining its fleeing primordial spirit with his life swords “Bai Zhang Quan” and “Yun Que Zai Tian.”

Having earned a brief moment of respite, Yue Qing surveyed his surroundings. No demons were involved in this fierce battle, and he stood atop a demon's head, gently shaking his wrist to scatter the blood that remained on his sword.

Satisfying.

The great sword immortal, with his back to the Sword Qi Great Wall, raised his arm and forcefully shook it.

Yue Qing advanced southward.

This highly lethal sword immortal had previously scoffed at the incense of the Confucian lineage and had proactively sought out the young hidden official to express his gratitude and apologies in person.

He was straightforward.

The old Daoist nodded slightly, acknowledging Yue Qing's politeness.

Then, he frowned as he adjusted the angle of the multi-treasure mirror several times, still pulling the light toward the Golden Throne. The old Daoist sighed internally, realizing that his level of cultivation was no longer peak and feeling helpless.

The golden throne beneath Yao Jia was inundated with the molten gold from the multi-treasure mirror, constantly overflowing and splashing out, as fast as flying swords. Whether sword cultivators or demons, anyone touched by it would instantly disintegrate, meeting a deadly end.

Yao Jia inquired, “Old Daoist, you clearly still have much life to live, yet you choose to perish here. Is it for enjoyment?”

This esteemed old Daoist from the Azure Heaven, holding two essential life items, had cracks appearing on the mirror's surface like a spider web. With every new fissure, the old Daoist, who had once embodied purity, would lose a thread of his vitality, visibly consuming his life force, while his whisk had been largely destroyed, leaving only the handle.

The old Daoist raised one hand with the mirror aloft and stroked his beard, smiling, “Enjoyment? You old hag!”

He spoke the coarsest words with the demeanor of a venerable immortal.

It was hard to imagine that this was the same man who once remarked, “When the peach blossoms bloom, if a yellow oriole still adorns the flowers, it is particularly enchanting; one cannot dare look, yet the heart stirs.”

Moreover, it was unimaginable that when the old Daoist preached in his own city of Baiyu Capital, many high-ranking true immortals from other cities would sit on cushions, sharing knowing glances.

Yao Jia paid it no mind and ceased to speak.

The two sides continued to exhaust themselves, consuming the fragments of divine beings while this old Daoist was hastily depleting his own life force.

This notable achievement in slaying one of the three saints of the Sword Qi Great Wall would be a triumph for me, Yao Jia, to claim.

According to the contract, Tuo Yue Mountain had promised to deliver an entire continent of Haoran to the Sword Qi Great Wall, where all Confucian academies, royal decrees, and the divine figures of mountains and waters would be fused into one, leaving none alive.

Particularly since it was heard that many ancient deities had reincarnated in Haoran, this was crucial for Yao Jia’s path to enlightenment. By refining them all, he could attain the sun suspended in the sky, assuming the form of a supreme deity, gazing down upon all beings and achieving true immortality. Regardless of the flow of the Dao, the so-called heavenly net would have to make way for him!

The great demon extended a hand, slowly raising it. On the outer edge of the mirror appeared a series of golden inscriptions, each word immense. Every golden character transformed into a colossal divine being several tens of feet tall. Among them, the characters for sun and moon served as the eye of the formation, with the manifested divine beings towering over a hundred feet, particularly those born from the characters “sun and moon,” adorned with halos of radiance, with golden streams drifting about, reminiscent of celestial garments in water and land murals.

Suddenly, the old Daoist stood up and laughed heartily, “In the future, if any sword cultivator travels to the Azure Heaven, remember to come visit the poor Daoist in my city! The scenery is exquisite, and the fairies are beautiful! Spending years with you all has been delightful!”

After this declaration, the old Daoist's body dissolved into his spirit, ultimately transforming into a dazzling rainbow light, first heading into the suspended multi-treasure mirror, and then bursting forth, directly colliding with the Golden Throne.

Even Yao Jia, the great demon, could not maneuver the throne to evade the rainbow light, having to watch helplessly as the old Daoist's spirit and intent dissolved into the Golden Throne.

Then, across the entire mirror's surface, a fissure appeared that the old Daoist had forcibly torn through with his spirit, and his final true words were merely three characters:

“Drop the Sword.”

The great sword immortal Mi He struck forcefully with his sword along the fissure, cleaving the entire Golden Throne in two.

After this battle, the great demon Yao Jia, whose life items were damaged, had to withdraw from the battlefield, exerting all efforts to repair the heavily damaged Golden Mountain.

At the entrance of the Jiazi account.

A burly man stood side by side with an old man in gray.

Liu Cha remarked, “Chen Xi and Nalan Shao Wei seem a bit off.”

They shouldn't be fighting so desperately, not to the point of sacrificing their lives.

The gray-clad elder nodded.

In contrast, Qi Tingji, the old deaf man, appeared quite normal, showing fierce strikes on the battlefield while still leaving himself an escape route, at worst losing a realm.

However, both Chen Xi and that Nalan Shao Wei, the family heads of the Taixiang Street aristocracy, were charging toward a dead end.

As for Dong Sangeng…

The old man glanced at the distant moon, high in the sky, believing that Dong Sangeng did not intend to return to the city wall. Moreover, when this person ultimately fell, it would surely be a grand spectacle.

Despite the division between enemies and allies, the gray-clad old man couldn't help but feel regret for Dong Sangeng.

Such a hero.

As for the fate of the Lotus Blossom Temple's master, the gray-clad old man did not care. Carrying the burden of Tuo Yue Mountain, the unauthorized refining of half a moon's essence was a transgressive act that deserved death. Now facing Dong Sangeng, he had the advantage of timing and geography, yet it was still a cage.

Liu Cha asked, “According to the latest predictions from the Jiazi account, is the Confucian Temple planning to hand over half of the world to the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

The gray-clad elder nodded, “A grand gesture indeed.”

That young hidden official, with an extremely utilitarian strategy, had aided the Sword Qi Great Wall in regaining its breath, while also being forced into a corner for years, allowing the sword cultivators to vent their frustrations. That fellow who had fallen from the sky, making a trip to the Azure Heaven and then returning, further alleviated the pent-up resentment among the sword cultivators.

The Confucian lineage had saints stationed here. The Sub-saint lineage had A Liang, the refined Chen Chuan'an. The Literary Sage lineage had great sword immortals on either side, including the hidden official Chen Ping'an.

These scholars who traveled from afar were all reasoning in their own ways, prompting the Confucian Temple of Haoran to agree to this matter.

On the battlefield, Li Cai halted.

A hundred feet away, a celestial figure emerged, the great demon Huang Luan.

This great demon passed through the ranks of the demon army and directly approached the deeply embedded Li Cai.

Huang Luan smiled, “You are Li Cai? I heard you bought that Tingyun Pavilion. How fortunate, it is already mine. Sheathe your sword and kneel, and I shall spare your life.”

After a brief silence, Huang Luan narrowed her eyes and said, “Well, the term ‘servant’ doesn't sound appealing for a female sword immortal. Let’s call you a sword attendant instead.”

Along with Li Cai, the entire Tingyun Pavilion, crafted from pure jade, included numerous relics left by sword immortals, such as the Sounding Pines Retreat, the Xu Xian Pavilion, and the Jia Zang Armory. All of these should have been her spoils of war.

At this moment, Li Cai was covered in wounds, though mostly concealed by her robe. It was evident that her cheekbones had been shattered by a demon warrior, leaving her skin raw and bones exposed.

Li Cai coughed up a mouthful of blood, tugged at her lips, and forced a smile, “You know I bought Tingyun Pavilion?”

Huang Luan nodded, “There are indeed some sword cultivators who fear death and cherish their lives.”

Li Cai sheathed her sword, her movements swift, and the sword intent surged, creating ripples that spread outward. In an instant, the demon army rushing toward her and Huang Luan lost countless heads.

Huang Luan’s fingers came together, and with a gentle shake, she dissipated the invisible sword essence, “Since you’ve reached your limit, there’s no need to put on a show.”

Li Cai asked, “Do you not know that even if you go to Tongye Continent, you will be pierced by a sword?”

Huang Luan chuckled in surprise, “My mood isn’t very good right now.”

Originally, Huang Luan held a position of authority among the sword cultivators in the Wildlands and was clearly someone favored by the gray-clad elder from Tuo Yue Mountain.

On one hand, she held a transcendent status among the demons, rarely at odds with other great demons. On the other, when she ventured to the Haoran world, what she sought were those so-called useless items that held little value. Moreover, Huang Luan herself had no great ambitions. In the words of another great demon, Huang Luan coming to Haoran was akin to collecting scrap.

Thus, Tuo Yue Mountain entrusted this significant campaign to Huang Luan to oversee.

However, this battle, likely unparalleled in history, was originally intended to be a tumultuous clash, with tens of thousands of sword cultivators clashing in a grand scale, but the Wildlands failed to overpower the Sword Qi Great Wall and suffered heavier losses than anticipated.

This led to Huang Luan and the great demon Yang Zhi having no choice but to cut through the backlines of the Wildlands to eliminate those trying to aid the Sword Qi Great Wall, thus making up for their failures.

Not only that, but Huang Luan also had to hurl half of her painstakingly refined treasures, including pavilions and towers, toward the Sword Qi Great Wall.

It was evident that the gray-clad elder from the Jiazi account was quite displeased with Huang Luan's performance.

Li Cai glanced back and realized she had unknowingly drifted somewhat far from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Clearly, her swordsmanship was quite impressive!

Huang Luan declared, “This is your last chance to survive.”

Li Cai thrust out a sword.

Huang Luan reached out to grasp the sword light, forcibly breaking it. The splintered sword light sprayed forth, leaving not a scratch on Huang Luan.

Li Cai bent down, darting forward, and in an instant, drew her sword from its sheath.

Huang Luan’s robe billowed as she unfurled her power.

The small world around them turned entirely white.

Li Cai's desperate final sword strike, driven to its peak, merely broke through Huang Luan's little world.

Huang Luan was indeed correct; Li Cai was at her last gasp.

Unable to draw a second sword, Li Cai retreated, spitting blood.

Huang Luan ignored the girl's pitiful state, raised a slightly torn sleeve, and gazed at her with some regret, then looked up with a smile, “Your sword intent is quite impressive. No wonder you’re a sword cultivator from the North Ju Lu Continent. I will definitely take you as my sword attendant. After capturing you, I will have Bai Ying help refine your soul anew. In the future, when we reach Tongye Continent, you can see if anyone can pierce me with a single sword…”

As her words lingered, Huang Luan pressed down with one hand.

In the blink of an eye, a massive vortex appeared in the sky, and a building the size of a mountain came crashing down toward Li Cai.

Just as Li Cai was about to draw her sword, she noticed an old man had already arrived beside her. He uttered a word of apology and pulled Li Cai back while simultaneously throwing his sword toward the building.

The long sword and sword light shot straight up, bracing against the building, as if single-handedly supporting a precarious structure.

Yao Chongdao, whose courtesy name was Lian Yun, perhaps cherished the phrase “Lian Yun” so much that he named both his longsword and life sword “Lian Yun,” a celestial being.

Before arriving here, the old man had exchanged a sword with the demon sword immortal, who had since retreated from the battlefield.

Huang Luan sighed, “I’m really not interested in military achievements. You're gravely injured; why come here to seek death? However, a free head thrown my way can’t be ignored.”

Above that building, another formidable structure descended, stacking upon the first. The “Lian Yun” sword light soared toward the sky, bending slightly under the pressure.

Huang Luan was using the losses of the mid-refined items in exchange for the wear and tear of Yao Chongdao's great refined items, and she saw no reason to hesitate.

Huang Luan's mind shifted, and a succession of celestial residences crashed down, causing the sword light “Lian Yun” to bend at its tip.

However, the old man's life sword had yet to make its appearance.

Huang Luan was curious to see if this injured Yao Chongdao could unleash a surprising move.

As Li Cai was about to rejoin the battlefield, the old man shouted, “Li Cai! It’s not that I look down on women; it’s that I look down on you, a Jade Purity realm. Retreat!”

Li Cai could only curse and decisively abandon her charge.

Huang Luan gazed up at the brilliant sword light that had already pierced through the building, laughing, “I initially thought you were merely sacrificing a long sword to save yourself. Fine, since you’ve made up your mind to waste your life, let it be your wish. Killing an immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall can make up for your transgressions.”

The old man, donned in a robe of the Sword Qi Great Wall, his sleeves billowing, suddenly inquired, “Do you recognize my granddaughter-in-law?”

Li Cai, not wishing to complicate matters or distract Yao Chongdao, nonetheless did not want to retreat just yet. She created some distance while nurturing her flying sword.

After hearing the question, she nodded, “I know her, quite well.”

Yao Chongdao hesitated for a moment before saying, “Then please inform that young man that there’s no need to come to our house to propose marriage. I’m not concerned about it.”

Li Cai was speechless.

This Yao Great Sword Immortal was clearly not indifferent, but it was impossible for him to drag that fellow by the collar to propose marriage to the Yao family.

Li Cai had wanted to mention her direct disciple, who had been smitten with that fellow, but the words lingered on her lips, and she ultimately held back.

Li Cai said, “Senior Yao, I can switch places with you. There might be a chance to retreat together.”

Yao Chongdao could not be bothered to expose the true thoughts of this girl from the North Ju Lu Continent. She was still young; what was the point of dying here?

Yet the old man smiled, “You shouldn’t underestimate the hidden abilities of a great demon. If a little girl like you were to die alongside a decrepit old man, it would seem like a love sacrifice. What kind of nonsense is that?”

The old man lightly leaped, sitting cross-legged, clouds billowing beneath him.

He stacked his hands over his abdomen, and mist began to rise, slowly manifesting a small, pure white flying sword.

Huang Luan remained composed, observing that Yao Chongdao's life sword was suitable for large-scale battles, akin to Wu Chengpei's “Ganyin” and Yue Qing's “Yun Que Zai Tian,” focused not on one-on-one combat.

Huang Luan gently exhaled a breath of multi-colored mist, vanishing in an instant without any grand display.

However, it sent chills down Li Cai's spine, who was quite a distance away from the battle.

Any great demon held within them the essence of time. Over prolonged periods, Huang Luan had refined over a hundred life items, continuously excavating and replacing until she possessed two celestial weapons and three half-celestial weapons.

As for those seemingly magnificent treasures, aside from three of them, the rest were merely mid-refined items, a hobby she indulged in to relieve stress.

Yao Chongdao spoke to himself, “Ning girl, from now on, you will be in charge of protecting. Don’t think that just because Ning girl is strong, you won’t protect her. What good man in the world doesn’t protect the woman he loves? If you can hold back Ning girl and help her escape the city to face Li Zhen, that’s wonderful. If you win against Li Zhen, even better.”

“So there’s nothing to worry about; I’m quite at ease.”

In an instant, the old man's forehead, temples, neck, heart, and abdomen seemed to be pierced by five colored flying swords.

Once pierced, his bones, flesh, soul, and sword intent were crazily drained through those five unremarkable holes.

Clearly, Huang Luan was displeased with Yao Chongdao’s sword light destroying too many structures.

Except for the fact that Li Cai was resolutely determined to thrust out her next sword, even at the cost of her life.

In the distance, a young woman was arriving on her sword, her aura formidable.

It was the one named Ning Yao.

Without warning, the old man shattered his life sword, closing his eyes with a light laugh, “Though I have yet to draw a sword, I die with purpose.”

Clouds and mist enveloped the area.

Yao Chongdao, employing his soul and sword intent combined with his life sword, crafted a world.

The next moment, Huang Luan found herself enveloped in dense white mist.

A celestial sword immortal, wielding a flying sword that was not a life-bound divine spell but had the means to bind a great demon—what significance did that hold?

Who could kill me? 

Li Cai? Or that Ning Yao, who was ultimately only in the Nascent Soul realm?

In the far distance, a certain scoundrel was beating two great demons, vanishing into thin air, directly breaking through two imposing small worlds.

One was a towering giant with three heads and six arms, his stance always accompanied by a golden cushion.

He had once been the first to ascend the Sword Qi Great Wall, only to be cleaved down by Chen Qingdu, after which he deliberately left a deep sword scar.

The other was a diminutive old man wielding a long staff, arriving atop the giant's shoulders, puzzled, “How strange?”

Moments later, within a battlefield, the clouds dispersed, revealing the truth.

A man, wielding Yao Chongdao's “Lian Yun” sword, pierced a great demon's head, lifting it high, and indifferently declared, “The slayer of Huang Luan is Yao Chongdao, A Liang.”

On the great moon that served as the battlefield, a tall old sword immortal stood atop a massive demon corpse, laughing heartily, “A Liang, how is it?!”

The sword severed the Lotus Blossom Temple's master—only Dong Sangeng alone.

Having discarded his life sword, the old man could still return to the Sword Qi Great Wall, exploding his sword intent to envelop the entire great moon, then manifesting a massive Dharma form to drag the great moon down to the earth, smashing it into the heavily gathered ranks of the Wildlands demons.

The great moon began to shatter, and the old sword immortal's figure gradually dissipated.

As the great moon descended, its overwhelming force compelled Yang Zhi, Fiery Concubine, and four other great demons to face that old sword immortal named Dong.

A Liang raised his arm high, giving a thumbs up.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 800: The Moon in the Sky (Part One)**

Nianxin was furious. "Chen Ping'an, what’s going on?!"

Sitting beside her, Shuangjiang let out a gentle sigh. One couldn't really blame the girl for her temper; she had grown accustomed to the tenacious nature of the Hidden Official Ancestor. In the past, every time they had sewn, they had persevered through countless accidents, so the seamstress had become used to the unexpected. No matter how dangerous the process was, it seemed they always managed to succeed. This time, however, the unexpected was truly unexpected.

After slaying another Yuanying realm demon sword cultivator within this cage, Nianxin needed to inscribe the true name of an ancient, ferocious beast during today’s sewing. She had to pierce through Chen Ping'an's back with her life-bound embroidery needle, connecting to his spine. With only two strokes left to finish, they were still short of success. If Nianxin hadn’t withdrawn her knife in time, Chen Ping'an's entire spine would have snapped in two, and the residual aura of the great demon's true name would have surged into his heart like a tidal wave of malevolence. If it weren't for the remnants of a few golden talisman texts still lingering in Chen Ping'an's mind, which Nianxin was quite familiar with, she would have had no way to suppress the malevolent aura. Consequently, Chen Ping'an's body and soul might have been reduced to a series of exploding firecrackers, with an ending akin to a celestial being self-destructing their golden core or Yuanying—impossible for even a deity to save.

The young Hidden Official lay on the ground, unable to rise. His back was flayed open, exposing his spine. Curled up on the floor, he twitched uncontrollably, blood pooling around him, mingling with the remnants of the great demon's true name lingering in the blood. In the end, the concentrated malevolence coalesced into a tiny "golden core" of sorts, hoping to become a descending spirit through the blood. If this were in the vast realm of righteousness, neglecting to control it might lead to the birth of a true golden core specter. If it found a sufficiently malevolent ancient battlefield, it could gather ghostly soldiers, establish a netherworld residence, and erect a king's banner, becoming a demon king that wreaks havoc for miles.

Nianxin was in a similar state of misery, vomiting several mouthfuls of pitch-black blood, this time not forcing it back down, but turning to spit on the ground.

The foreign demon of the Erqing serpent waved its robe's sleeve and extracted the swiftly forming true name spirit from the blood-soaked ground, suspending it before them. Shuangjiang extended her fingers and gently crushed it. The filth and malevolence that could have turned a lower-level Yuanying cultivator into a spirit puppet dissipated completely.

Moments later, Chen Ping'an managed to sit up. His soul trembled, and his body convulsed as if a giant fish were flipping beneath the ground. His blood boiled as if a flood were raging within, thankfully, his life-bound objects began to circulate on their own, helping to calm the anomalies, allowing Chen Ping'an to maintain the steadiness of his fleshly body. He apologetically said, "I really can't take it anymore."

Shuangjiang shot a meaningful glance at Nianxin, signaling her to stop rubbing salt in the wound.

Though Nianxin ceased her tirade, her expression remained displeased as she said in a low voice, "We're about to strike at Yunqing and Qingqiu. If you continue like this, I suggest you just stop. After all, this true name 'garment' is barely usable now."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

After Nianxin helped Chen Ping'an roughly stitch up his wounds, she vanished in an instant.

Her seemingly "careless" actions of adding the final touches were all part of a tacit understanding among the three: Nianxin pretended to be clumsy, Chen Ping'an acted as though he was oblivious, and Shuangjiang feigned ignorance.

Once Nianxin left, Shuangjiang cautiously advised, "Hidden Official Ancestor, each time you exchange your life for another's, your physical condition deteriorates. It's already difficult enough, and then you immediately have to deal with stitching? This is not a wise course of action."

If she didn't proceed with the sewing, Chen Ping'an's body and divine consciousness would recover rapidly, like a sickly person who has just regained their health, or someone who has been blind for ages finally seeing light. He would be immersed in a relaxing, comfortable "little world." At this moment, he could already stumble to his feet, his form slightly hunched as he took slow steps, the large pool of blood on the ground having been cleared away by Shuangjiang, and the remnants of the true name demon had long been collected by Nianxin into her embroidery bag. Shuangjiang silently praised the diligent seamstress, who was quite the clever girl.

Chen Ping'an said, "Right now, sewing is just too painful. Every time I kill a demon, the thought of it makes my heart tremble. I just want to finish it all in one go. Besides, Nianxin said that the more pain I endure, the deeper the memory, the better the effect."

Shuangjiang slowly replied, "With the cage's suppression, every time you decide to exchange lives at a critical moment, a place of impossibility is quietly forged, and all your methods come into play. That's how you've narrowly managed to slay Yuanying sword cultivators time and time again. Just like that cockroach-like sword cultivator, even after being suppressed by you to a half-step down in realm, it still managed to stab your heart with one blow. If it were anyone else, taking that 'merciless' strike would mean certain death."

"And how would you kill the others in the upper five realms? Mengpo and Qingqiu are slightly easier; Mengpo's life-bound divine ability is proficient in illusion, which doesn't affect you much. Just give her a loophole to exploit. Qingqiu is naturally at a disadvantage due to being slain by you. The bamboo's life-bound painting struggles to unfold fully within the cage's little world. If it spreads the painting, you fold the mountains and rivers, each countering the other; there's bound to be some opportunity. But that Yunqing is a different story. These four are just discussing whether you have any chance at all. As for the immortal realm Lord Changjun, you have no hope whatsoever. The moment you open the cage door, it's a death sentence."

Shuangjiang concluded, "Unless... unless you reach the pinnacle of the martial artist realm, simultaneously breaking through the Guanghai and Longmen realms as a Qi practitioner, enabling you to ascend to the golden core. Of course, the premise is to avoid provoking that Lord Changjun, as the realm disparity is too great; no amount of scheming would be of any use."

Chen Ping'an stepped out of the prison. "The pinnacle of the martial artist realm, attaining the golden core? You make it sound easy. You have no idea what my current situation and plans are."

The foreign demon, following closely behind, repeatedly clenched its fists, arms lifting above its head, shouting, “The Ancestor handles matters without discrimination of size, lifting heavy things as if they were light. A thousand-pound task is like a feather, and endless worries are but a drizzle. The Ancestor can turn clouds and rain with a single hand...”

As a result, it took a punch from the not-so-pleased Chen Ping'an, shattering its form. After reassembling, it appeared listless and no longer noisy.

Being a loyal but stubborn minister, untrusted, while being a treacherous sycophant also earns you a beating. Truly, the intentions of heaven are hard to fathom; accompanying a ruler is like being with a tiger.

Chen Ping'an walked toward the pavilion below the prison.

The five Yuanying sword cultivator demons, including the yellow-brown one, followed the general path that Shuangjiang had outlined. The sole goal was to leverage their timing and advantages to surpass the Yuanying sword cultivators. Thus, it didn’t count as a pure sword duel among sword cultivators, nor could it be deemed unfair. The yellow-brown ones, as sword cultivators, also possessed their own secret techniques and hidden skills. Chen Ping'an's greatest reliance was still on his life-bound object, the cage of the sparrow, and its little world. The cultivation realms of both sides were evenly matched, and he would additionally have the advantage of the martial artist's supernatural power.

According to Shuangjiang, as long as Chen Ping'an eventually reached the Yupu realm, nurturing the Cage of the Sparrow properly, then the future "mutual rise and fall" would mean each side was at one realm's disparity; if you fell a realm while I rose a realm, that would be the true demeanor of a sword immortal. Breaking through realms to slay enemies would be as easy as picking up coins off the ground.

However, these were all distant, unreachable matters—something to ponder and derive joy from for now.

Upon reaching the pavilion, Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, laying the narrow blade of "Zhan Kan" across his knees. He began his breathing exercises to refine his residual martial luck while also contemplating the deal with Shuangjiang, multitasking by practicing and discussing both matters.

After ascending to the Dongfu realm, regardless of how Shuangjiang, who was in the Ascending realm, viewed it, for Chen Ping'an himself, accustomed to the ups and downs of the lower five realm cultivators, returning to cultivate as a mid-five realm immortal was a world of difference.

As he breathed in a leisurely manner, a misty white aura filled the air around his facial orifices, pure spiritual energy swirling like slender yet striking white serpents hanging from a cliff.

Particularly at the center of his brow, a particle of innate spiritual light flickered between brightness and dimness.

And at the corners of his eyes, golden light flowed faintly, his eyes resembling two chambers, with two bright lamps illuminating the bamboo curtains at the entrance.

This was the “earthly immortal, the appearance of enlightenment” that Qi practitioners below the Earth Immortal realm dream of.

Fighting against five Yuanying sword cultivators, whether honing his martial arts to forcibly temper his martial luck into the mountain roots of his bones, or examining his injuries to patch up his weaknesses, even refining the flaws of his life-bound object, the gains could be described as immense.

Shuangjiang adhered to the rules, not stepping even half a foot into the pavilion, like a wandering ghost drifting outside.

Chen Ping'an's agreement with the foreign demon about a grain of Gu Yu coin was nearing its conclusion.

A grain of Gu Yu coin could be divided into ten small Summer Solstice coins, all of which were Shuangjiang's life-saving money.

Having gifted the execution object from the ancient Dragon-slaying Platform, the narrow blade "Zhan Kan," Shuangjiang received the first Summer Solstice coin, a fortunate start.

The series of inscriptions containing "The Clear Heart" could assist Chen Ping'an, during his seated meditation and breathing exercises, to forget his physical form more quickly, allowing his mind to delve deeper. The effect was akin to a Daoist's sitting on a celestial mat or lighting incense in a cave. Although it belonged to the slow and steady method, it was by no means negligible. Lower five realm cultivators drawing upon the spiritual energy of heaven and earth were like cupping water with both hands—very arduous; while upon reaching the mid-five realm, it was akin to using a bucket to draw from a well—naturally much faster.

Not only did Chen Ping'an acquire a treasure blade that could suppress the likes of dragons, but he also gained lasting benefits for his future cultivation, a great deal.

For the second Summer Solstice coin, Chen Ping'an had Shuangjiang elaborate on the cultivation techniques for the Dongfu, Guanghai, and Longmen realms, including all the combinations for refining life-bound objects of various levels.

Chen Ping'an decided to ascend to the Dongfu realm within the prison, as Shuangjiang confidently stated, this opportunity was one that would be lost if missed. Utilizing this chance to roam within, she assisted in locating six of the ten mountains that had already opened up their life-bound apertures, successfully obtaining the third Summer Solstice coin.

While Shuangjiang taught and clarified the Dao, she also managed to strike an additional deal with her abilities. She mentioned the banner of the sword immortal that had been refined in the mid-levels. It needed to be placed atop the mountain shrine using secret techniques. At that time, she had not discussed the details, so Chen Ping'an willingly took the bait. The foreign demon earned its share, while the Hidden Official Ancestor, a Dongfu realm Qi practitioner, gained another cultivation technique, adding to his skills.

Furthermore, she explained how to refine the mock White Jade Capital Tower into a new aperture in the Guanghai realm after refining it into a life-bound object. It could serve as an important auxiliary life-bound object, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The five elements that naturally breed within a person's little world could be refined in this "White Jade Capital," yielding twice the result with half the effort, fostering five life-bound objects. This was Shuangjiang's timely assistance.

In addition, she provided methods to add finishing touches to the wall paintings of the Water Palace. The three types of celestial techniques Shuangjiang imparted to the Hidden Official Ancestor cost Chen Ping'an only one Summer Solstice coin.

At this point, Shuangjiang had already secured four Summer Solstice coins.

The two short swords, seemingly casually mentioned by Shuangjiang as "the boat carving from years past," were deliberately left vague, concealing their true origin. One bore the inscription "Dirt," and the other "Lake." The former had already been placed within Chen Ping'an's sword nurturing gourd and didn't count as a trade, but the "Lake" sword, which Shuangjiang claimed was better when paired, was priced at one Summer Solstice coin, and Chen Ping'an agreed.

Unbeknownst to him, the foreign demon had already earned five Summer Solstice coins.

Once Chen Ping'an reached the Longmen realm, he could begin to refine the two ancient relic swords into the water dragons of the Water Palace. As for the originally water-dan coalesced water luck dragon, it would be refined into a pearl of water luck. In the future, the denser the water luck became, the higher the grade of that pearl would be.

Initially gifting a "Dirt" sword, followed by discussing the benefits of refining the "Lake" sword, along with the banner of the sword immortal and the mock White Jade Capital, were all part of the foreign demon's fishing strategy, offering half the bait and keeping the other half.

Chen Ping'an had no objection to Shuangjiang's business methods; after all, it was a fair trade and not forced selling.

In addition, Shuangjiang had gradually used her true and false celestial robe, the two green serpents hanging from her ears, and all the gold and fragments of the golden body she had earned in a fifty-fifty split with "Long Life," to strike four more Summer Solstice coin deals with Chen Ping'an.

Only one Summer Solstice coin remained.

Gathering enough for a grain of Gu Yu coin, according to their agreement, the foreign demon Shuangjiang would be able to leave the prison immediately, gaining a sense of carefree freedom. Moreover, once she left the prison, neither Chen Ping'an nor Chen Qingdu could target her in any way. As long as she did not follow the demon clan into the vast realm of righteousness or harm any sword cultivator of the Sword Qi Great Wall, she could choose to become a local tyrant in the wilderness or hide in the vast realm of righteousness, establishing a sect at her whim.

During this time, Shuangjiang had previously agreed to owe a snowflake coin, buying a little story from Chen Ping'an.

In turn, Chen Ping'an quickly used a snowflake coin to trade for the true material of that Five Thunder Stamp.

Shuangjiang suddenly said, "I thought that seemingly inconspicuous snowflake coin would determine the outcome of our deal. I didn't expect you to eliminate my doubts so quickly."

Once Shuangjiang secured nine Summer Solstice coins, plus a bunch of miscellaneous snowflake coins, even if she was only short one snowflake coin of a grain of Gu Yu coin, the deal would still not be fulfilled.

The awkwardness of this transaction for Shuangjiang, the foreign demon, lay in the fact that she was just one Summer Solstice coin short—it was a dead end. Even if she were short just a snowflake coin, it would still be a dead end.

Chen Ping'an remained with his eyes closed, candidly stating, "At first, I did consider playing tricks with that snowflake coin, but I changed my mind later."

Shuangjiang halted, anxiously asking, "You’re not planning to withhold the last Summer Solstice coin from me, are you? Hidden Official Ancestor, please don’t conduct business like that; it’s too hurtful."

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes and shook his head. "Of course not. The matter regarding the first Summer Solstice coin means you can live."

Shuangjiang gently nodded, confused, "I know this, but I’ve never dared to believe it."

Chen Ping'an said, "Do you really want to see Shuangjiang again? For a foreign demon that has gained pure freedom, do you still need such an obsession?"

A moment of silence ensued as Chen Ping'an continued, "You are no longer merely a celestial couple. Besides, with your cultivation and mindset, when and where would you not be with that great cultivator Shuangjiang, inseparable?"

Because Shuangjiang's heart demon was the woman he loved.

It should be after Shuangjiang ascended to the upper five realms that this connection arose and persisted until Shuangjiang reached the Ascending realm. It was even possible that it was during her attempts to reach the lost realms that this foreign demon truly materialized. However, Shuangjiang never managed to completely sever this heart demon, ultimately leading to their separation. It was likely that Shuangjiang had utilized some profound Daoist technique to merely expel the heart demon but was never able to truly subdue or refine it. Yet, these were all just unsubstantiated speculations; the truth of the matter was known only to heaven, unless Chen Ping'an were to visit the Qingming realm in the future and meet the true "Shuangjiang."

The foreign demon squinted, asking, "How did you guess that? Was it the embroidered handkerchief from that woman's boudoir that revealed my background, or did my instinct evade you when you touched my head?"

Chen Ping'an retorted, "What guessing? Wasn’t it you who wanted me to know the truth?"

The white-haired boyish foreign demon chuckled, hovering in the air, clapping gently. "What a Hidden Official Ancestor! You never fail to disappoint me, Chen Ping'an."

Chen Ping'an declared, "For the last Summer Solstice coin, let’s make a hundred-year agreement: before we reunite, you help me protect someone in secret."

The white-haired boy lightly flicked the ear of the green serpent, saying, "In the fifth realm, only Qi practitioners below the upper five realms are allowed to enter. I can’t go against Confucian rules. I’m powerless here; this deal is difficult for me. Chen Ping'an, that’s not fair; you’re intentionally making it hard for me."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "My teacher is over there, and I believe the Confucian sage guarding the passage will eventually turn a blind eye. But you only have one chance to act; after that, at most, you’ll be expelled by the Confucian sage. At that point, you'll follow my teacher's arrangements for retreat. Whether it's returning to the vast realm of righteousness, settling on Falling Star Mountain, or being imprisoned in the Merit Forest, I will find you, no matter what it costs, and I will uphold my promise to restore your freedom. If you don't act, we’ll meet in the fifth realm."

The white-haired boy queried, "What if?"

Chen Ping'an replied solemnly, "What if I cannot keep my promise to find you? Regardless, after a hundred years, you will still obtain your freedom."

The white-haired boy began to wander around the pavilion, seemingly weighing the pros and cons.

He started discussing details with the young Hidden Official, "Scholars value face. If I swagger about hidden within the soul of some sword cultivator, that can't be considered hidden. Even if your teacher helps soften the blow, that won't be appropriate. If Nianxin could enter the fifth realm, her soul is profound enough, but she's in the Yupu realm and cannot go. This cannot be blamed on me; that great demon from the Capturing and Releasing Pavilion, first, its skills are specialized, plus it can hide within the depths of a golden core sword cultivator's mind, successfully evading all the sword immortals. Clearly, this is not something that can be accomplished overnight. If you give me three to five years to grind it out, I can find a golden core cultivator to take root."

Chen Ping'an said, "I will help you find a hidden place."

The white-haired boy mused, "Hidden Official Ancestor, you’ve planned everything. No matter how many words I have in my heart, they seem to evaporate when they reach my lips."

Chen Ping'an stood up, re-attaching the Zhan Kan to his waist. "If you agree to this, I ask you, in that new realm, not to do anything unnecessary. No more 'let’s see.' Otherwise, you will have to burn incense every day, praying for my demise on the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Chen Ping'an laughed, squinting, "In the past, before every fight, I never liked to speak harshly to others. Today, I’m making an exception for you; please cherish it."

The white-haired boy no longer wore a cheeky smile but bowed respectfully, "I will heed the Ancestor's decree. Starting now, the deal for a grain of Gu Yu coin is settled."

Chen Ping'an leaned back and fell to the ground, his hands cradling the back of his head. "I’ll first see how Meng Po and Qing Qiu are faring. If I can’t handle them, then I’ll have to rely on you to act on my behalf with your celestial methods."

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, saying, "Perhaps you intentionally let me know the identity of the woman, mistakenly believing that you are the heart demon that Shuangjiang cares for. In truth, it’s all a ruse; it doesn’t matter. You’ve won; after all, I’ve lost nothing."

The white-haired boy's expression grew despondent. "To carry a hero's burden without freedom, seeing the Hidden Official Ancestor like this truly tugs at the heartstrings."

Chen Ping'an drew his sword from its sheath without glancing at the foreign demon, swiftly striking down. The foreign demon quickly reassembled, hopping toward the pavilion, giving a thumbs-up repeatedly, alternating hands. "Not every hero can sway the heavens, nor are they all capable of causing the mountains and rivers to sink. Ancestor... oh, what a superb sword technique!"

Nianxin sat on the distant steps, watching the foreign demon and the azure-clad guest in the pavilion. As parting drew near, she felt an unexpected pang of reluctance. 

In her life as a seamstress, she had never encountered such lively yet peaceful times; she no longer had to worry about the unexpected schemes on the mountains, nor did she see eyes looking at her as if she were a ghost.

The trio walked down a desolate street. Li Cai donned a snow-white robe, with a slender white sword, "Frost Jiao," hanging at her waist, its blade already snapped in two.

Along with this woman, the leader of the Floating Sea Sword Sect, were the youth Chen Li and the girl Gao Youqing, who would follow Li Cai to North Julu Prefecture as her direct disciples.

Li Cai believed she was not as heroic as the likes of Lu Zhi; her appearance had returned to normal, the scars on her face were not obvious, although her complexion was pale, clearly not fully healed from her severe injuries. The true hidden danger lay within her life-bound flying sword, Snowflake, which had suffered extensive damage. It was likely she would never reach the immortal realm in this lifetime. However, Li Cai didn’t mind; a woman with a high realm often struggled to find a husband, no matter how good her temper was.

After arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, this female sword immortal had engaged in continuous battles, leading the charge each time. In the past few years, the rules of the Summer Palace had been many, and the Hidden Official's flying sword was the most troublesome, imposing heavier restrictions on sword immortals. Among many sword cultivators, she had likely scolded the young Hidden Official the most vigorously, far surpassing local sword cultivators.

After being severely injured and retreating from the city wall, she abandoned all her war merits, seeking only a long sword from the sword shop and a robe from the clothing shop.

A close friend, the Great Immortal Li Yu, had once promised to join her in going to the Sword Qi Great Wall to slay demons.

Upon reaching the tavern, Li Cai scrutinized the "no business" sign, finally tearing down a piece from the wall and holding it in her hand.

Not in a hurry to return to North Julu Prefecture, she planned to travel to South Poso Prefecture, perhaps to visit the mountain peak of the sword immortal Yuan Qingshu.

Li Cai carried with her a battered sword nurturing gourd, a relic of Yuan Qingshu, which should also be returned to his sect.

Years ago, on the city wall, Yuan Qingshu had joked with the local sword immortal Gao Kui, using the sword nurturing gourd as a wine vessel, pairing it with the name of a great demon for an exquisite taste.

In the end, both had perished.

Li Cai turned to the two small heads at the tavern's entrance, smiling, "Tell the second shopkeeper that this 'no business' sign has been taken by Li Cai."

Feng Kangle responded, "What does it matter? Just take it. A woman as beautiful as you, if the second shopkeeper sees you, he wouldn’t dare utter a word."

It was one thing to spend money drinking at another shop, but to cause a ruckus here would only humiliate their own tavern.

Tao Ban, with a good memory, recalled all the customers who bought and drank at the tavern, asking, "Sister Li, why hasn’t the second shopkeeper shown his face? Has he covered his face again, dressing himself up, secretly slaying demons?"

Li Cai laughed, "Sister Li? Did the second shopkeeper teach you that?"

Tao Ban nodded.

Feng Kangle complained, "Why did you act so foolishly? You lost all your sincerity in an instant."

Li Cai restrained her smile, saying, "Bring me one jar of every type of liquor; I want to take it to South Poso Prefecture."

Gao Youqing was engraving words onto the "no business" sign with her flying sword when Chen Li remarked, "What’s so good about that Pang Yuanji?"

Gao Youqing turned, hiding the sign, and retorted in anger, "That’s none of your business."

Li Cai stood at the threshold of the tavern, gazing at the city wall.

She had come here to wield her sword freely, not realizing that her swordsmanship was far from sufficient, ultimately accruing a tremendous debt of gratitude to that Yao sword immortal. The crucial question was how she would repay it in the future.

The youth looked dejected. "Master, does that mean I will be a disciple of the Floating Sea Sword Sect from now on?"

Li Cai said, "Then learn from this second shopkeeper. 'In the vast realm of righteousness, Hidden Official Chen Ping'an. At the Sword Qi Great Wall, Floating Sea Sword Lake Chen Li. Both do not interfere with each other. The hometown is always ahead, while the identity of a cultivator comes after, not forgetting one's roots.'"

The youth nodded, it was a viable plan.

Ultimately, Li Cai led the youth and girl away from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The Upside Down Mountain temporarily had no ferry service to North Julu Prefecture, so they randomly found a celestial inn to stay in.

Li Cai drank alone.

Li Tui Mi, Tao Wen, Zhou Cheng, Nalan Yexing, Gao Kui, Yao Chongdao, Dong Sangeng...

The young sword cultivators, many of whom were of similar ages to Chen Li and Gao Youqing, would only continue to increase in number.

Li Cai’s vision blurred with drink, leaning against the window. "Damn this broken Yupu realm."

Gao Youqing was staying next door, still adjusting to the vastly different environment between Upside Down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, where the spiritual energy and sword energy differed greatly.

Chen Li, carefree, while practicing his sword, weighed his purse at a store in the inn that specialized in selling mountain treasures. The entire Spirit Herb Lodge had already relocated. Previously clearing stock, they had sold many low-quality miscellaneous spiritual artifacts at a bargain to various familiar forces of Upside Down Mountain, this inn was one of them, so although there were not many treasures, at first glance, it was still dazzling.

Li Cai, always paying attention to Chen Li's sword intent from afar, furrowed her brow. Her murderous intent surged, and she dashed off.

Li Cai seized the youth's life-bound flying sword, blood flowing from her palm and dripping onto the floor, utterly unaware, saying to Chen Li, "So many sword cultivators have died; it’s not for you to come to the vast realm of righteousness to seek death. If you truly want to die, wait until you become a sword immortal. Killing a Guanghai realm sword cultivator, who would remember who you are? If you keep this up, you might as well become a wild cultivator in the mountains; you would surely die quickly. Otherwise, in your future cultivation, you get killed first, and I’ll be so furious I won’t know how to avenge you."

The person targeted by Chen Li's flying sword was a shopkeeper who appeared panicked. Upon seeing Li Cai, he bowed deeply in apology, offering numerous justifications, claiming ignorance and pleading not to die. After all, it was mainly Chen Li's unstable heart and excessive murderous intent that had caused this situation; he had already left the battlefield, but his heart was still reverberating there.

This was a good thing, but if Li Cai continued to ignore it, then even if Chen Li reached North Julu Prefecture, as long as he went down the mountain to explore, he would die.

Li Cai opened her hand, and the youth immediately retracted his flying sword.

Chen Li said apologetically, "I harbor no resentment towards my master or North Julu Prefecture."

Li Cai smiled, "Master doesn’t care about that. All I care about is whether you’ve practiced your sword diligently and if the Floating Sea Sword Lake can really produce a sword immortal in a hundred years."

Chen Li honestly replied, "Reaching sword immortal status within a hundred years is somewhat challenging."

Li Cai patted the youth's shoulder, wiping the blood from her palm. "You’re a big man; show some spirit! As my direct disciple, even if you’re only a mid-five realm sword cultivator, when speaking with others, especially when calling for battles, you should carry yourself with the demeanor of an upper-five realm sword immortal!"

Hearing the terms "centenarian sword immortal" and "hundred-year sword immortal," the shopkeeper in charge of the tavern trembled violently, regretting his actions and quickly thinking of ways to remedy the situation.

Li Cai and the youth exchanged heartfelt words, so the youth reluctantly "bought" the intriguing spirit artifact at a high price.

On their way back to their lodgings, Li Cai asked, "Do you remember that guy? Find a way to get your own revenge in the future."

Chen Li's face brightened as he nodded vigorously.

Li Cai knocked on Gao Youqing's door, grabbing the girl's face and twisting it, "Chen Li needs to keep his temper in check! Gao Youqing, what’s wrong with you? Are you too timid and afraid of trouble? When Chen Li draws his sword, Master will stop him, but he’ll be happy in his heart. You, on the other hand, just stand there and watch the excitement from afar, showing no intention to draw your sword? That makes Master very unhappy!"

Gao Youqing, still being pinched, nervously said, "Master, my brother told me to endure and not provoke trouble once I arrive at the vast realm of righteousness."

Li Cai spat, "No wonder Gao Ye is still a pitiful Yuanying."

Gao Youqing's eyes turned red instantly. 

It wasn’t just the yearning for her brother, who had been her companion since childhood, but also the worry that their separation wasn't just simple, but rather a silent farewell.

Li Cai immediately released her grip, gently saying, "Alright, alright. Endure if you must, but Master can teach you both a clever little trick. If you’re bullied, just endure it, but if a fellow disciple is bullied, you must chop that person to the ground! Kill the ones that need killing, and if not, just give them a good beating! Our Floating Sea Sword Lake has some resources; we can afford their medical expenses! That way, both you and Chen Li can endure when you need to, and release your frustrations when it's time. If it comes down to a fight, just return home and call Master to step in again..."

Initially, the youth and girl found this amusing, but upon hearing "return home," they both fell silent and dejected.

Li Cai sighed lightly, waved her hand, and went off to drink, leaving her disciples with a simple instruction: "Go practice your swords."

The old deaf man finally returned to the prison, accompanied by Youyu and Changming, for the first time visiting that pavilion.

The prison where Mengpo resided was already empty.

The old deaf man caught a glimpse of the young Hidden Official, clad in unfamiliar robes that were oversized and trailing on the ground.

Chen Ping'an seemed to be in a meditative state, completely oblivious to the arrival of the old deaf man.

The old deaf man reached out and grabbed the jade hairpin that Chen Ping'an had tucked in his hair, drawing it toward himself, saying in a deep voice, "The sword immortal needs this for a moment, it will be returned to the Hidden Official shortly."

Chen Ping'an remained unmoved.

The old deaf man glanced at Nianxin, who was sitting at the bottom of the steps, carefully stowing the jade hairpin into his sleeve. He didn’t trust that foreign demon, but this stubborn little girl was still more reliable.

Nianxin sensed the old deaf man’s scrutinizing gaze and spoke up, "It’s fine; he brought it upon himself. It has nothing to do with Wu Shuangjiang."

The woman who manifested from the golden copper coins slightly frowned.

Shuangjiang smiled, "Long Life Dao friend, in this world of business, there’s no such thing as taking all the advantages. You must give back nine for every ten received; that’s the truth. You should learn from my ancestor a bit."

The woman nodded gently.

Youyu, for some reason, looked at the young Hidden Official's figure at that moment and felt a twinge of fear.

The old deaf man hurriedly left, vanishing from the prison.

The youth and woman ascended the steps together.

Shuangjiang followed behind, saying, "Long Life Dao friend, shall we continue to scour the land?"

The woman smiled, "I have been waiting eagerly."

Gao Kui, with his last sword strike, questioned the sword master, Dragon Lord.

After receiving the sword, Dragon Lord personally slain the last sword immortal of the sect.

Not far from the gray-robed figure, the skeletal white Ying sat on the throne, watching this scene, feeling that the minds of these sword cultivators were truly baffling.

(End of chapter)

 **Chapter 800: The Moon in the Sky (Part One)**

Niangxin was furious, "Chen Ping'an, what’s the matter with you?!"

Sitting beside them, Shuangjiang let out a gentle sigh. It was hard to blame the young girl for her fiery temper; she had grown accustomed to the firmness of the Hidden Official’s disposition. Previously, every time they sewed, they managed to endure, so it became second nature for the seamstress to expect both minor and major mishaps. Regardless of how dangerous the process seemed, success always felt inevitable. But this time, the unexpected was indeed very unexpected.

Within this cage, after slaying yet another Yuan Ying realm demon sword cultivator, Niangxin needed to engrave the true name of an ancient ferocious beast onto Chen Ping'an's back this time during their sewing. She had to pierce through with her life-bound needle and connect to his spine, and with only two strokes remaining, it was still a near failure. If Niangxin hadn’t sheathed her knife in time, Chen Ping'an's entire spine would have snapped in two, and the residual aura of the ferocious beast's true name would have surged like a tidal wave into his heart. If it weren’t for a few leftover words from the Golden Jade Codex in Chen Ping'an’s mind that Niangxin was familiar with, quickly used to suppress the aura of the true name, he might have ended up as nothing more than a series of exploding firecrackers, much like that earth immortal who self-destructed their golden core and Yuan Ying—no divine being could save him then.

The young Hidden Official lay on the ground, unable to rise, his back flayed open, exposing his spine. His body curled on the ground, twitching, blood pooling around him, mingling with the lingering malevolence of the demon’s true name. In the end, the thick residual malice coalesced into a grain-sized "golden core," aiming to use his blood as its "foundation for cultivation," hoping to become a descending spirit. If they were in the vast world of righteousness, without intervention, perhaps in an instant, a genuine golden core ghost would arise, finding a sufficiently malevolent ancient battlefield to gather ghostly soldiers, build a netherworld dwelling, and establish a king's banner, thus becoming a calamity-spawning ghost king.

Niangxin, too, was in a sorry state, spitting out several mouthfuls of dark, ink-like blood, this time not forcing it back down but turning her head to spit it on the ground.

The Outer Heavenly Demon of the Qing Snake waved its robe sleeve casually, pulling the quickly forming grain-sized spirit of the true name from the pool of blood on the ground, suspending it before them. Shuangjiang stretched out her fingers, gently crushing it. Those vile malevolent energies, sufficient to turn a lower five realms cultivator into an undead puppet, vanished without a trace.

Moments later, Chen Ping'an sat up, his soul trembling, his internal muscles and bones vibrating slightly, as if a light-scaled fish was flipping beneath the ground. His blood boiled like floods raging everywhere. Fortunately, the five elemental life-bound items began to operate on their own, helping to calm the anomalies, allowing Chen Ping'an to maintain his physical form, apologizing, "I really can't take it anymore."

Shuangjiang shot a look at Niangxin, signaling her not to rub salt into the wounds anymore.

Though Niangxin stopped cursing, her expression remained displeased as she spoke in a low voice, "We’ll be going after Yunqing and Qingqiu soon. If you’re still this useless, I suggest you just stop here. After all, this true name 'garment' is barely usable now."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

After Niangxin helped Chen Ping'an patch his skin roughly, she vanished in a flash.

Her few "unintentional" embellishments were deliberately overlooked, with Chen Ping'an pretending to ignore them and Shuangjiang pretending not to see. The three shared an unspoken understanding.

Once Niangxin left, Shuangjiang cautiously persuaded, "Hidden Official, every time you use your life to exchange for another, your body is left on the brink. It’s already difficult enough; you shouldn’t immediately sew after slaying a demon. This is not wise."

If he didn’t sew, Chen Ping'an’s body and spirit would recover quickly, like a sick person just recovering from a severe illness, or like someone who had been blind for a long time finally seeing the light. He would be immersed in a relaxed and comfortable "little world." At this moment, Chen Ping'an could already stumble to his feet, his figure hunched, slowly wandering about. The large pool of blood on the ground had long been cleaned up after Shuangjiang dispelled the true name’s evil spirit, and it had been neatly stored away by Niangxin in her embroidery pouch. Shuangjiang quietly praised how diligent and frugal the seamstress was, and how she had turned the tables on the young lady.

Chen Ping'an said, "Now, the sewing part is just too painful. Every time I think about killing a demon, I tremble at the thought and want to get it done in one go. Moreover, Niangxin has said that the more it hurts, the more profound the memory, and the better the effect."

Shuangjiang slowly replied, "With the confinement of the caged bird, each time you decide to exchange your life, a place is subtly crafted where none can intervene. Every time, you narrowly manage to slay a Yuan Ying sword cultivator, just like that cockroach-like sword cultivator you suppressed by half a realm—how could that not result in him striking your heart with a single sword? If it were anyone else, after being hit by that 'savage' sword, they would be dead for sure."

"How would you kill the others in the upper five realms? Meng Po and Qingqiu are somewhat manageable; Meng Po’s life-bound divine ability specializes in illusions, which doesn’t affect you much—just give her a flaw to exploit. Qingqiu, on the other hand, is naturally hindered by the sword's suppression. The bamboo shoot's life-bound painting, within the caged bird’s little world, the bamboo shoot’s divine ability is hard to fully unleash. When the bamboo shoot spreads the painting, you can fold mountains and rivers, and it’s still possible to seize an opportunity. But Yunqing? That’s a different story. These four are merely discussing whether you have the slightest chance. As for the immortal realm’s Hou Changjun, you have no chance at all; once the prison door opens, it’s a death sentence."

Shuangjiang concluded, "Unless… unless you reach the peak of the Martial Husband realm and simultaneously break through the Observing Sea and Dragon Gate realms to reach the Golden Core. The premise, of course, is not to provoke misfortune and recklessly challenge that Hou Changjun, as the gap in realms is just too significant; all your schemes would be useless."

Chen Ping'an exited the prison, saying, "The peak of the Martial Husband realm, achieving Golden Core? You make it sound easy. You don’t know my current situation and plans, do you?"

The Outer Heavenly Demon trailed behind cheerfully, repeatedly clenching its fists, its arms raising higher than its head, shouting, "The old ancestor handles matters, regardless of size, with ease! A thousand-pound task, as light as a feather; timeless woes, like a drizzle; the old ancestor can turn clouds and rain with a wave of the hand…"

In retaliation, Chen Ping'an struck the Outer Heavenly Demon with a punch, causing it to shatter into pieces. After reforming in place, it hung its head, appearing listless, no longer a nuisance.

Being a loyal minister who refuses to be trusted is as bad as being a scheming flatterer who gets beaten. Truly, the hearts of the heavens are hard to read, accompanying a lord is akin to accompanying a tiger.

Chen Ping'an walked toward the pavilion below the prison.

The five Yuan Ying demon sword cultivators, led by Huang He, followed the general approach that Shuangjiang had outlined. The only goal was to take advantage of the time and place to surpass their opponents. In doing so, it certainly wouldn’t be a pure duel among sword cultivators, but it wouldn’t be considered anything less than fair either. Huang He and the others, as sword cultivators, also had their own secret techniques and hidden skills. Chen Ping'an’s greatest reliance was still the life-bound technique of the caged bird, a small world that leveled the playing field, while both sides were at half a realm. Additionally, he had the might of a martial artist from the Outer Realm as a backup.

According to Shuangjiang, as long as Chen Ping'an eventually ascended to the Yu Pu realm and nurtured the caged bird properly, the future "mutual rise and fall" would mean that they would each be at a different level—if one falls, the other rises. That would truly be the grand demeanor of a sword immortal, breaking through realms and slaying foes as easily as picking up coins off the ground.

However, these were all unattainable distant dreams, for now, they could only be wished for, a moment of happiness stolen.

Upon arriving at the pavilion, Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, placing the narrow knife "Zhan Kan" across his knees. He began to breathe and meditate, tempering the remaining martial luck while simultaneously contemplating the business deal with Shuangjiang, multitasking with his cultivation.

After entering the Cave Dwelling realm, no matter how much Shuangjiang, who had ascended, didn’t take it seriously, for Chen Ping'an himself, accustomed to the ups and downs of the lower five realms, returning to cultivate as a middle five realms immortal felt entirely different.

As he breathed steadily, a white mist enveloped Chen Ping'an's face, the essence of spiritual energy swirling like delicate white serpents, hanging down from steep cliffs.

Especially at the center of his brow, a grain of inherent spiritual light flickered between brightness and darkness.

At the same time, the area around his eyes flowed with a faint golden hue, creating a pair of eyes that resembled two chambers, with two bright lights illuminating the entrance’s bamboo curtain.

This was the "Earthly Immortal, the Path of Enlightenment" that cultivators in the lower realms dreamed of.

Having fought five rounds with the Yuan Ying sword cultivators, whether it was honing his martial path, forcibly forging martial luck into the foundation of his bones, or checking for flaws through his injuries, he could be said to have gained immensely.

Shuangjiang adhered strictly to the rules, not stepping a single foot into the pavilion, like a wandering soul drifting outside.

Chen Ping'an's agreement with the Outer Heavenly Demon for a grain of Gu Yu money was also nearing its end.

A grain of Gu Yu money was divided into ten pieces of Xiao Shu money, all of which were payment for Shuangjiang’s life.

After gifting the execution weapon from the ancient Dragon-Slaying Platform, the narrow knife "Zhan Kan," Shuangjiang received the first piece of Xiao Shu money, marking a good start.

The inscription "This Heart of Spirit" could help Chen Ping'an sit in meditation and direct his energy more quickly and deeply, resembling the effect of a cultivator's meditation on an immortal's mat or lighting incense in a cave dwelling. Although it belonged to the method of "dripping water penetrating stone," it was not to be underestimated. Lower five realm cultivators, drawing energy from heaven and earth, were like cupping water with their hands, extremely difficult. Once they reached the middle five realm, it was as if they had a bucket to draw from a deep well, making the process much faster.

Chen Ping'an not only obtained a precious sword capable of suppressing the likes of a flood dragon but also a lasting benefit for his future path of cultivation—a significant profit.

For the second piece of Xiao Shu money, Chen Ping'an had Shuangjiang elaborate on the cultivation techniques for the Cave Dwelling realm, Observing Sea, and Dragon Gate realms, and all the combinations for refining life-bound items, both large and small.

Chen Ping'an decided to reach the Cave Dwelling realm within the prison. At that time, spiritual energy would flood into the small world, as Shuangjiang had assured him, this opportunity was once in a lifetime. By taking this chance to explore, he could help locate the ten mountains of the Crown Prince that had already opened their life-bound acupoints, successfully obtaining the third piece of Xiao Shu money.

While teaching, Shuangjiang, using her own abilities, managed to strike an additional business deal. She mentioned that the life-bound banner of the sword immortal needed to be erected at the peak of the mountain shrine using secret methods. At the time, she hadn’t gone into detail, so Chen Ping'an naturally took the bait. The Outer Heavenly Demon earned money while the Hidden Official, as a Cave Dwelling realm cultivator, gained an additional cultivation technique, adding icing on the cake.

Additionally, there was the imitation Baiyu Jing treasure pagoda, detailing how to open up new acupoints in the Observing Sea realm after refining it into a life-bound item. This could serve as an important auxiliary life-bound item, one that could absorb the essence of heaven and earth. The five elemental life-bound items naturally birthed within a person's small world could be refined here in the "Baiyu Jing," making it twice as effective, nurturing five life-bound items simultaneously. This was Shuangjiang’s timely assistance.

Moreover, she shared how to add the finishing touch to the water palace mural. The three secret techniques imparted to the Hidden Official by Shuangjiang cost Chen Ping'an only one piece of Xiao Shu money.

At this point, Shuangjiang had already secured four pieces of Xiao Shu money.

The two short swords that Shuangjiang spoke of casually, mentioning "Carving the Boat in Years Gone By," were intentionally vague. She did not wish to reveal their true roots. These two swords were inscribed with the characters "Dew" and "Lake," respectively. The former "Dew" sword had already been placed in Chen Ping'an’s sword nurturing gourd, so it didn't count as a transaction. However, the "Lake" sword, which Shuangjiang claimed would be a match for the Hidden Official, was priced at one piece of Xiao Shu money, which Chen Ping'an agreed to.

Unbeknownst to them, the Outer Heavenly Demon had already earned five pieces of Xiao Shu money.

Once Chen Ping'an reached the Dragon Gate realm, he could begin refining the two ancient relic swords into two water palace "dragon pools" for flood dragons. As for the water element flood dragon originally condensed from water dan, it would be refined into a water element black pearl. In the future, as his cultivation progressed, the thicker the water element became, the higher the grade of that black pearl.

The first piece of "Dew" sword would be given for free, while the benefits of the "Lake" sword's refinement, along with the sword immortal's banner and the imitation Baiyu Jing, were essentially the Outer Heavenly Demon fishing for profit, giving half the bait while keeping the other half.

Chen Ping'an didn’t mind Shuangjiang’s business tactics; after all, it was a fair transaction, not an act of coercion.

Furthermore, Shuangjiang had successively completed transactions with the materials from her true and false heavenly immortal cave attire, the two Qing Snakes hanging from her ears, as well as the entire sum of gold and fragments of her golden body that she split with "Longevity Dao Friend," resulting in four pieces of Xiao Shu money.

Only one piece of Xiao Shu money remained.

With a complete grain of Gu Yu money, as per their agreement, the Outer Heavenly Demon Shuangjiang could immediately leave the prison, gaining a boundless freedom. Moreover, once it departed, neither Chen Ping'an nor Chen Qingdu could target it again. As long as it did not follow the demon clan into the vast world of righteousness to harm any sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, it could choose to become a ruler in the wilderness or hide in the vast world of righteousness, supporting puppets and establishing its own sect.

During this time, Shuangjiang had expressed willingness to defer one piece of snowflake money to buy a little story from Chen Ping'an.

In the end, Chen Ping'an quickly used a piece of snowflake money to exchange for the true material of the Five Thunder Seal from Shuangjiang.

Suddenly, Shuangjiang said, "I initially thought that insignificant snowflake money would become the decisive factor in our transaction. I didn’t expect you would so quickly alleviate my doubts."

Once Shuangjiang had secured nine pieces of Xiao Shu money, along with various scattered snowflake coins, even if they were just one snowflake coin short of a grain of Gu Yu money, the transaction still wouldn’t be completed.

The awkwardness for Shuangjiang, the Outer Heavenly Demon, lay in the fact that being short of one piece of Xiao Shu money was deadlock; even if it was just one snowflake coin short, it still meant the same.

Chen Ping'an remained with his eyes closed, frankly stating, "I had thought about making some moves with that snowflake coin at first, but then I changed my mind."

Shuangjiang halted, a worried expression on her face. "You’re not planning to withhold the last piece of Xiao Shu money, are you? Hidden Official, don’t do this; it’s too damaging to your reputation."

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, shaking his head. "Of course not. You can live because of our first transaction involving the grain of Gu Yu money."

Shuangjiang nodded gently, puzzled. "I know this, but I’ve always found it hard to believe."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Do you really want to see Shuangjiang again? For an Outer Heavenly Demon who has gained pure freedom, is there really a need for such an obsession?"

Silence fell between them as Chen Ping'an continued, "You’re no longer anything akin to a celestial couple. Besides, with your cultivation and state of mind, when would you not be by the side of that great cultivator Shuangjiang, inseparable?"

For Shuangjiang, her heart demon was the woman he loved.

It should have been a connection of fate that Shuangjiang found after ascending to the upper five realms, only to become manifest when she ascended to the ascension realm. It was even possible that it happened when she attempted to reach the lost realms. This Outer Heavenly Demon truly came into being, yet Shuangjiang had never been able to completely eradicate this heart demon. Ultimately, they were worlds apart. It was likely that Shuangjiang had used some profound celestial method, merely exiling the heart demon without truly subduing or refining it. However, these were all mere conjectures without roots. The truth remained a mystery that only time could reveal, unless Chen Ping'an were to venture into the Qingming world, where he might see the real "Shuangjiang."

The Outer Heavenly Demon narrowed its eyes, asking, "How did you guess? Was it the embroidered handkerchief from that girl that revealed my origins, or was it when you touched my head, my instincts dodging?"

Chen Ping'an countered, "What’s there to guess? Wasn’t it you who wanted me to know the truth intentionally?"

The white-haired boyish-looking Outer Heavenly Demon smiled brightly, floating in the air, clapping lightly, genuinely praising, "Well done, Hidden Official. You truly never disappoint, Chen Ping'an."

Chen Ping'an said, "With the last piece of Xiao Shu money, let’s make a hundred-year agreement. Before we meet again, you will help me protect someone in secret."

The white-haired boy lightly flicked the green snake by his ear, saying, "In the Fifth World, only cultivators below the upper five realms are allowed to enter. I can’t go against Confucian rules. With intentions but no power, this task is hard for me. Chen Ping'an, aren’t you being unreasonable, deliberately making this difficult for me?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "My teacher is over there. I believe the Confucian sage guarding the pass will ultimately turn a blind eye. You only have one opportunity to act. After that, at most the Confucian sage will drive you out of the realm. At that time, you will follow my teacher’s escape plan, whether it’s returning to the vast world of righteousness, settling at Falling Ruins Mountain, or being imprisoned in the Lin of Meritorious Deeds. I will come to find you, no matter what the cost. I will honor my promise and restore your freedom. If you do not take action, we will meet in the Fifth World."

The white-haired boy asked, "What if…?"

Chen Ping'an replied solemnly, "What if I cannot keep my promise to find you? Regardless, after a hundred years, you will still gain your freedom."

The white-haired boy began to wander around the pavilion, seemingly weighing the pros and cons.

He began to discuss details with the young Hidden Official: "Scholars value face. If I were to hide this blatantly within a certain sword cultivator's soul, it wouldn’t really be hidden. Even if your teacher helps smooth things over, it wouldn’t be appropriate, would it? If Niangxin could enter the Fifth World, her soul must be deep enough, but she is in the Yu Pu realm and cannot go. This cannot be blamed on me. That great demon in the Capture and Release Pavilion—first, its expertise is specialized, and secondly, it can hide in the depths of a golden core sword cultivator’s mind, successfully fooling all the sword immortals. Obviously, this isn’t something that can be accomplished overnight. If you were to give me three to five years of time, I’d have a good chance of finding a golden core cultivator to occupy and take over."

Chen Ping'an said, "I will help you find a place to hide."

The white-haired boy sighed, "Hidden Official, your calculations are flawless. No matter how many words I have in my heart, when it comes to my lips, I find myself speechless."

Chen Ping'an stood up, reattaching Zhan Kan to his waist. "If you agree to this, I would appreciate it if you refrain from doing anything unnecessary in that brand new world. Don’t try anything 'just to see what happens.' Otherwise, you’ll be burning incense daily, praying for my death at the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, squinting his eyes, "In the past, I never liked to threaten anyone before a fight. Today, I’m making an exception for you, so cherish it."

The white-haired boy no longer wore a playful expression; he was now solemn and respectful, bowing deeply, "I shall comply with the old ancestor’s decree. From now on, a grain of Gu Yu money will count as a completed transaction."

Chen Ping'an leaned back, his hands resting behind his head, saying, "I’ll first test the depth of Meng Po and Qingqiu’s abilities. If I find myself helpless against them, I will then need to trouble you to step in with your own methods."

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, stating, "Perhaps you intentionally led me to believe that the girl was the heart demon born from your affection. In reality, it was all just a ruse. It doesn’t matter; you win, and I haven’t lost anything."

The white-haired boy’s expression turned sorrowful, "Heroes live unfree; seeing you, the old ancestor, in such a hero's plight truly tugs at the heartstrings."

Chen Ping'an casually drew his sword, slashing through the air without so much as a glance at the Outer Heavenly Demon, who quickly reformed and hopped over to the pavilion, giving a thumbs-up repeatedly, "Not every hero can avert disaster; even a hero can be a calamity for the world, old ancestor… Oh, what a great sword technique!"

Niangxin sat on the distant steps, watching as the Outer Heavenly Demon and the azure-clad guest from the pavilion were likely to part ways, feeling a twinge of reluctance.

As a seamstress, she had never experienced such bustling activity on her path of cultivation, yet it felt so stable, free from the burdens of unforeseen plots from the mountains, and she had never been looked at as if she were a ghost.

The three of them walked down a desolate street. Li Cai wore a snow-white robe, a delicate white sword named "Frost Flood Dragon" hanging from her waist—its sheath now broken into two.

Alongside this female sect leader of the Floating Sea Sword Sect were the young man Chen Li and the girl Gao Youqing, both following Li Cai to Bei Ju Lu Zhou to become her direct disciples.

Li Cai believed she lacked the heroic flair of that Lu Zhi, her appearance having returned to how it was before. The scars on her cheeks were not very noticeable, yet her complexion was pale, indicating that she had not fully healed from her severe injuries. The real hidden danger lay in her life-bound flying sword, which had suffered significant damage. It was likely that she wouldn’t be able to hope for ascension to the Immortal realm in this lifetime. However, Li Cai didn’t mind; a woman with high cultivation faced difficulties in getting married, no matter how good her temper was.

This female sword immortal had been constantly battling since arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, always at the forefront. In the past few years, there had been many rules during the summer palace visits, and the Hidden Official’s messages via flying swords were the most annoying, imposing heavier restrictions on sword immortals. Among all the sword cultivators, it was certainly her, Li Cai, who insulted the young Hidden Official the most, far exceeding that of local sword cultivators.

After being severely injured and retreating from the city wall, she had relinquished all her war merits, only asking the Sword Qi Great Wall for a sword from the sword shop and a robe from the clothing shop.

There was a dear friend, the Great Xianjun Li Yu; they had once agreed to go to the Sword Qi Great Wall together to slay demons.

Upon reaching the tavern, Li Cai perused the "No Business" signs until she finally pulled down a "No Business" sign from the wall, grasping it tightly in her hand.

Not in a hurry to return to Bei Ju Lu Zhou, she intended to travel to Nan Po Sha Zhou for a bit, such as visiting the mountaintop of the sword immortal Yuan Qingshu.

Li Cai carried a heavily damaged sword nurturing gourd, a relic of Yuan Qingshu, which she should return to his sect.

Years ago, atop the city wall, Yuan Qingshu had once joked with local sword immortals Gao Kui, filling the sword nurturing gourd with wine and pairing it with the name of a great demon, making for an endless delight.

Yet both of them had died.

Li Cai turned to see two small heads peeking from the tavern’s entrance and smiled, "Tell the second shopkeeper that this 'No Business' sign has been taken by Li Cai."

Feng Kangle chuckled, "What does it matter? Just take it. A girl as pretty as you, if the second shopkeeper sees you, he wouldn’t dare say a word."

It was fine to go to another shop to buy wine, but causing a ruckus would disgrace their own tavern.

Tao Ban had a good memory, recalling all the customers who came to buy and drink in the tavern. "Sister Li, why hasn’t the second shopkeeper shown his face? Did he offend a lady again, making himself look all fancy while secretly slaying demons?"

Li Cai burst into laughter, "Sister Li? Did the second shopkeeper teach you that?"

Tao Ban nodded.

Feng Kangle complained, "You’re being so stupid; it’s not sincere at all."

Li Cai restrained her laughter, saying, "Bring me a pot each of every type of liquor; I’m taking them to Nan Po Sha Zhou."

Gao Youqing was etching words onto the "No Business" sign with her flying sword, while Chen Li raised an eyebrow, "What’s so good about that Pang Yuanji?"

Gao Youqing turned around, hiding the "No Business" sign, and retorted angrily, "You don’t get a say!"

Li Cai stood at the threshold of the tavern, gazing at the city wall.

She had come here to wield her sword freely, only to find her skills were far from sufficient, ultimately owing a tremendous debt of gratitude to that Yao Sword Immortal. The key was how she would repay it in the future.

The young boy looked dispirited, "Master, am I going to be a disciple of the Floating Sea Sword Sect from now on?"

Li Cai replied, "Then learn from this second shopkeeper. 'In the Vast World of Righteousness, Hidden Official Chen Ping'an. At the Sword Qi Great Wall, Floating Sea Sword Lake Chen Li. They do not interfere with each other. Hometown always comes first, while cultivation comes second, not forgetting one's roots.'"

The boy nodded; it was a plan.

Li Cai ultimately took the young boy and girl away from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

For the time being, there were no cross-province ferryboats docking at the Hanging Mountain toward Bei Ju Lu Zhou, so they casually found an immortal’s inn to stay in.

Li Cai drank alone.

Li Tui Mi, Tao Wen, Zhou Cheng, Nalan Ye Xing, Gao Kui, Yao Chong Dao, Dong San Geng…

There were so many young sword cultivators, many of whom were around the same age as Chen Li and Gao Youqing.

In the future, there would only be more.

Li Cai, with her drunken gaze, leaned against the window, thinking, "Just let this pathetic Jade Pu realm die."

Gao Youqing was staying next door, still adapting to the vastly different environment between the Hanging Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall. The spiritual energy and sword energy were worlds apart.

Chen Li was carefree, weighing his purse at a shop in the inn that specialized in selling treasures from the mountain. Since the entire Lingzhi Zhai had relocated, they had cleared out their inventory, selling many low-tier miscellaneous spiritual artifacts for cheap to the various factions in the Hanging Mountain, and this inn was one of them. Thus, the treasures here were limited, yet at first glance, they seemed to be a dazzling array of goods.

Observing from afar, Li Cai frowned at Chen Li’s sword intent, her killing intent surging as she dashed away.

Li Cai reached out to grab the boy’s life-bound flying sword, blood flowing from her palm, dripping to the ground, entirely unaware, as she said to Chen Li, "So many sword cultivators have died; it's not meant for you to come to the Vast World of Righteousness to die. If you truly wish to die, wait until you become a sword immortal before saying so. Killing an Observing Sea realm sword cultivator? Who would remember who you were? If you continue to be so impatient, you might as well become a wild cultivator in the mountains; you'd definitely die quickly. Otherwise, in the future, during your cultivation, you’d be the first to be killed, and I’d be left half-dead from anger, without knowing how to avenge you."

The individual targeted by Chen Li's flying sword was a flustered tavern keeper, who, upon seeing Li Cai, bowed deeply in apology, rambling on about many reasons: being blind to the situation, not deserving of death, and all that. Of course, it wasn’t a matter of beating and killing; in the end, it was Chen Li’s unstable sword intent, filled with murderous intent. Though he had already left the battlefield, his sword intent still resonated there.

This was a good thing, but if Li Cai continued to disregard it, then even if Chen Li made it to Bei Ju Lu Zhou, as soon as he descended the mountain to roam, he would die.

Li Cai opened her hand, and the young boy immediately retracted his flying sword.

Chen Li said apologetically, "I have no complaints against Master, nor against Bei Ju Lu Zhou."

Li Cai laughed, "Master doesn’t care about these things; just focus on whether you practice the sword well, and whether the Floating Sea Sword Lake can truly produce a Sword Immortal."

Chen Li sincerely replied, "Reaching sword immortal status within a hundred years is still somewhat challenging."

Li Cai clapped the boy on the shoulder, wiping the blood from her palm, "You’re a big man, show a bit of spirit! I, Li Cai, have direct disciples, even if you’re just a middle five realms sword cultivator. When you speak to others, especially when it comes to fighting, you must carry the air of an upper five realms sword immortal!"

Hearing the terms "Hundred-Year Sword Immortal" and "Centennial Sword Immortal," the tavern keeper's eyelids twitched, regretting it deeply as he hurriedly thought of ways to remedy the situation.

Li Cai and the boy exchanged heartfelt words, and the boy reluctantly "overpaid" for a spiritual artifact that had caught his eye.

As they returned to their lodgings, Li Cai asked him in a low voice, "Remember that fellow? Find a way to get back at him in the future."

Chen Li smiled broadly and nodded vigorously.

Li Cai knocked on Gao Youqing’s door, grabbing the girl’s cheek and twisting it, "Chen Li needs to hold back a bit. Gao Youqing, what’s wrong with you? Are you too timid and afraid of trouble? When Chen Li pulls out his sword, Master will stop him, but in his heart, he will be pleased. You, on the other hand, seem to enjoy watching from afar, without any thought of joining the fray? That makes Master very unhappy!"

Gao Youqing, having her cheek twisted, timidly said, "Master, my brother told me to endure once I arrived in the Vast World of Righteousness and absolutely not stir up trouble."

Li Cai scoffed, "It’s no wonder Gao Ye Hou is still a pitiful Yuan Ying."

Gao Youqing immediately teared up. 

Not only did she miss her brother, who had been her companion since childhood, but she also worried that their separation was not as simple as a mere parting; it was a quiet death.

Li Cai immediately released her grip, speaking softly, "Enough, enough. Endure if you must, but Master can teach you both a clever little trick. If you’re being bullied, bear with it, but if it’s a fellow disciple being bullied, then you can chop him to bits! Kill who needs to be killed, but don’t go around hacking indiscriminately. Just leave them half-dead; our Floating Sea Sword Lake still has some money, we can afford the medical bills! This way, you and Chen Li will have endured what you needed to endure and vented your anger. If it comes down to a real fight, just return home and call for Master to step in!"

At first, the young man and woman found it amusing, but upon hearing "return home," they fell silent, their spirits dampened.

Li Cai sighed lightly, waved her hand, and went to drink alone, leaving her disciples with the command, "Go practice your swords."

The old deaf man finally returned to the prison. You Yu and Chang Ming followed the elder, visiting the pavilion for the first time. 

The prison where Meng Po resided was already empty.

The old deaf man arrived at the stairs, glancing at the young Hidden Official within the pavilion, clad in an unfamiliar robe so large that its sleeves dragged on the ground.

Chen Ping'an seemed to be in a trance, completely unaware of the old deaf man’s arrival.

The old deaf man reached out, grabbing the jade hairpin that Chen Ping'an had tucked into his hair, bringing it to himself, and said solemnly, "The Master Sword Immortal needs to borrow this item for a short while and will return it to the Hidden Official soon."

Chen Ping'an remained unfazed.

The old deaf man glanced down at Niangxin, carefully tucking the jade hairpin into his sleeve. He didn’t trust the Outer Heavenly Demon, but he found this stubborn girl to be more reliable.

Noticing the old deaf man's scrutinizing gaze, Niangxin spoke up, "It’s fine, he asked for it; it has nothing to do with Wu Shuangjiang."

The woman who manifested from golden coins furrowed her brow slightly.

Shuangjiang smiled brightly, "Longevity Dao Friend, in worldly business, how can one take all the advantages? One must return nine for every ten taken; that is the principle. You should learn a thing or two from my old ancestor."

The woman nodded lightly.

You Yu, for some unknown reason, felt a little intimidated by the sight of the young Hidden Official at that moment.

The old deaf man hurriedly left, disappearing from the prison.

The boy and the woman ascended the stairs together.

Shuangjiang followed behind, asking, "Longevity Dao Friend, shall we continue to scour the land for treasures?"

The woman replied, "I’ve been waiting for this."

Gao Kui's final sword strike questioned the Sword Asking Founder, Dragon Lord.

After receiving the sword, Dragon Lord personally executed the last sword immortal of the lineage.

From a distance, in a gray long robe, the skeletal figure of Bai Ying sat on the throne, watching this scene unfold, feeling that the minds of these sword cultivators were indeed increasingly baffling.
