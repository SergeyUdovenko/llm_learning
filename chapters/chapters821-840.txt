**Chapter 821: In the Wind and Snow**

When the old scholar was sent out of the Fifth World by Bai Ye with a single sword stroke, it was the third year of the Jiachun Era. 

By the time the old scholar visited Bai Ze and returned to the cultural temple in the Central Plains, it was the fourth year of Jiachun. When he arrived in the capital of the Great Li (Dali) on the central part of Baoping Continent and reunited with his former top disciple by the shores of the newly vibrant Qidu, it was already the early spring of the fifth year of Jiachun. The willows swayed gently, flowers bloomed amidst the trees, and the orioles chirped joyfully. Children got out of school early, and paper kites soared high in the wind.

This warm spring scene made the old scholar's frown ease, and he turned to Cui Qian beside him to ask if he had any thoughts on naming the Fifth World. 

Cui Qian replied that he had none.

However, Cui Dongshan, who followed behind them, had some ideas, but unfortunately, the old scholar did not inquire further. He merely mentioned that at the cultural temple, they initially considered naming it "Rules," but the Saint of Rites disagreed, saying that rules were like spring winds nourishing things, and did not need to be put on paper. Various philosophers had made suggestions, including several elders from the Yin-Yang School and the Agricultural School who collectively proposed "Peach Blossom Spring," which received more supporters. It symbolized a paradise beyond the mundane, implying beauty and allowing people to remember the Confucian contribution in creating a brand new world. Moreover, in the southeast of the new world, there was indeed a peach tree known for its extraordinary phenomena, blooming but never bearing fruit for many years. However, when Bai Ye split the heavens with his sword, it immediately bore fruit. Despite this, the sub-saint still rejected the suggestion.

Thus, the Fifth World still lacked a proper name. 

Cui Dongshan scoffed, "Is a pure land born from fleeing the calamities truly a paradise? I don’t believe there are many at ease in the Fifth World. After surviving disasters, people loosen their grip slightly and immediately start vying for territory, scheming, and causing chaos. Once the situation somewhat stabilizes, and they’ve enjoyed a few days of comfort, the folks from Tongye Continent will definitely settle scores, starting with their own people, cursing Yuguizong and Tongye Sect for being useless, unable to protect their homeland, and then cursing the cultural temple in the Central Plains, and finally cursing the Sword Qi Great Wall. They may not dare to speak out, but they’re surely thinking it. This is such a chaotic place; how can it be a paradise?”

The old scholar nodded, "The sub-saint seems to think similarly."

Cui Dongshan immediately changed his tune, "Then let's call it 'Peach Blossom Paradise.' I wholeheartedly support this idea. If that's not enough, I'll drag Gao Laodi over to back it up."

The old scholar treated it like a passing breeze. How strange, Cui Qian didn’t seem to have this temperament when he traveled to the alley years ago.

Before leaving, the old scholar handed over the character “Mountain,” which he had borrowed from the Grand Scholar of the Book of Rites, to Cui Qian.

Cui Qian did not refuse.

The old scholar implied that the matter of returning this character—how and when it would be returned—was entirely his business and had nothing to do with Cui Qian or the Great Li.

After Cui Qian departed, Cui Dongshan swaggered over to the old scholar and whispered, "If that old bastard doesn’t return the ‘Mountain’ character, are you planning to use that merit to make amends with the Saint of Rites?" 

Cui Dongshan had never doubted the old scholar's ability to clean up messes. In the past, the lineage of the Confucian Sage had always relied on the old scholar to patch things up, apologizing to students or providing support while arguing and flailing his sleeves around.

In Pei Qian’s eyes, her senior brother walked like a big white goose, his large sleeves flapping about. It was obvious who he learned that from.

There was an old gentleman who once guarded his chicks like a mother hen.

The old scholar eyed the youth in white with disdain. 

That little rascal was just so displeasing to look at.

Cui Dongshan shrank his neck and obediently called out, "Master Ancestor," acknowledging the teacher of his teacher, who was of a higher generation than himself.

Cui Dongshan sidled closer, holding his walking stick and lightly poking the ground, signaling to the old scholar that he was now your disciple, so even if he spoke up, it didn’t mean he’d be hit—teaching students was the teacher’s job, and it wasn't the place of a master ancestor.

Cui Dongshan huffed, "That Cui Qian fellow hardly spoke a word, utterly disrespectful! I’ll help you scold him more later."

The old scholar slowly replied, "You two are ultimately distinct individuals now. Cherish it. After all the rivers and mountains you’ve crossed together, you should understand that many rivers may vanish after they diverge from a single source. You must ensure that it flows far and wide."

Cui Dongshan nodded eagerly, "Besides being a constant flow, like the clear depths reflecting the heavens, one should also strive to be as upright and resilient as you, Master. If one can remain steadfast against the wind and rain, even if one feels a tinge of the passage of time, they can still face it without fear. Every bit of knowledge should serve as a resting point for future generations, allowing them to travel far and wide."

The old scholar smiled knowingly, "It seems that the ethos of Luopo Mountain has indeed been led astray by you."

However, after the notion of "clear depths reflecting the heavens," with tranquility and eloquence, it was indeed a beautiful way to put it. Among the direct disciples, Xiao Qi and Xiao Ping'an were both deserving of it.

Cui Dongshan looked dispirited, "If you say so, Master, then so be it."

The old scholar gently inquired, "What about over at Luopo Mountain?"

Although the question seemed a bit vague, Cui Dongshan immediately understood and hurried a few steps closer, replying softly, "Reporting to the Master Ancestor, we’re still short on money, but our assets are steadily increasing. The offerings to Zhou Fei are quite generous, and the status of the Lotus Root Blessed Land is not only not declining but improving. Moreover, the Master has brought back a long-lived friend from the Sword Qi Great Wall, an ancestor of gold and copper, who is a manifestation of fortune. She is in our Baoping Continent, and when she reaches Luopo Mountain, she will be in the right place. Additionally, there is a woman born from the confluence of literary energy in the Lotus Root Blessed Land. Now, we have both literary and financial prosperity at Luopo Mountain."

The old scholar raised his chin slightly.

Cui Dongshan added, "Brother Dazhong has already left, and pure martial artists at the Golden Body level cannot enter the new world. This rule is well established."

The old scholar nodded, "Scholars should not be ashamed to talk about money, nor should they feel embarrassed about making a profit. It’s not like earning a bit of money with ability means one loses their scholarly demeanor. The great divide between honor and disgrace—gentlemen love wealth, but those who prioritize righteousness over profit are honored. This is how one should acquire it rightly."

Cui Dongshan curiously asked, "So, is the Fifth World filled with blessings now?"

The old scholar hummed in agreement. "That peach tree, for instance, is a significant blessing, ranking within the top ten. Bai Ye hastily built a temporary hut there and left that celestial sword behind to repay the debt of borrowing a sword from Daoist Sun of the Great Xuandu. Bai Ye is waiting for a certain Daoist from the lineage of Sword Immortals to return the celestial sword. Once that is done, Bai Ye will return to the Haoran World. Thus, this hut is not something anyone would dare to take."

Cui Dongshan laughed, "If the Daoists of Bai Yujing were to charge in, that would be amusing."

The old scholar had indeed visited that place. The peculiar peach tree, with roots extending deep into the earth and blessed by heaven, did not appear remarkable at first glance; it looked no different from ordinary wild peach trees and seemed devoid of any auspicious signs.

However, the old scholar and Bai Ye could separate the heavens and earth, so their insight was naturally beyond that of ordinary immortals. Bai Ye had contributed immensely; let alone a single peach tree, even ten could be relocated at his whim.

Bai Ye sheathed his sword and immersed himself in study. The peach tree thrived in the hut, gradually bearing fruit. Among the branches, flowers and fruits intertwined, and at the foot of the tree lay the celestial sword.

Scholars occasionally travel afar, leaving behind a long sword to guard their home.

The old scholar gathered a large bag of peach blossoms from under the tree, intending to use them for brewing wine. He also asked Bai Zhi, the Blessed Land, to craft several dozen peach blossom stationery. Meanwhile, he secretly took a few handfuls of the famous "ten-thousand-year soil" from beside the tree, which was rare, for his closed-door disciples to use, so he took a bit more.

Of course, the old scholar had informed Bai Ye beforehand about his intentions, loudly inquiring if it was permissible. Since Bai Ye remained silent inside the hut, the old scholar took it as his brother’s tacit approval. In reality, it was only a few days after the old scholar left that Bai Ye returned from his travels. When the scholar saw the peach tree completely stripped, he looked up to check the branches, and that was when he received Bai Ye's parting sword.

Of course, the wording the old scholar used at the cultural temple implied that Bai Ye had sent him off with a gift.

At the dawn of creation, the first person at the jade purity realm, the first immortal, the first one to slay the "quirky" cultivators... all favored by the heavenly way.

The first pure martial artist to break through in that realm, the first to reach the distant travel realm, or the mountain pinnacle realm... all protected by martial fortune.

The first to establish the ancestral hall, burn incense, hang portraits, and branch out, the first to establish a sizable secular dynasty at the foot of the mountain, the first baby born in the new world, the first pair of immortal couples forming a covenant in that realm, all at the middle five realms... blessed by humanity.

In short, in this vast world, the three realms gather, and blessings abound.

Cui Dongshan suddenly looked worried, "My senior sister Pei Qian broke through to the sixth and seventh realms too quickly. She foolishly let go of her strongest realms in the North Julu Continent. If she ascends to the mountain pinnacle realm early in the Aiai Continent, she will definitely have to visit the Fuyun Continent. That place is much messier than the stagnant Tongye Continent, which makes me anxious."

The old scholar asked, "Have you been to the Qingming World?"

It was a leading question; he knew Cui Dongshan wasn't at the Ascended realm. Cui Dongshan replied with annoyance, "Have you been?"

Blame it on that old rascal who kept haunting him, making him accustomed to sparring with others. Realizing that this kind of conversation with his master ancestor wouldn’t yield good results, Cui Dongshan immediately covered his tracks, "Since the Master Ancestor hasn’t been, nor has the teacher, how could I dare to go first?"

The old scholar didn’t hold a grudge against Cui Dongshan’s disrespect; he wasn’t petty. He noted it down and planned to visit the Aiai Continent to consult with Pei Qian.

The old scholar looked up at the sky, observing that the Confucian sacrifices' sage, who stood guard here, was the final figure in the cultural temple, which is why Bai Yujing's third master Lu Chen had once teased him as "the seventy-two."

The old scholar walked slowly and said, "Not only in the Qingming World, but our Haoran World is pretty much the same. In every Daoist temple, the first great hall is the Hall of the Spirit Officials, and that great spirit official’s statue is indeed majestic. I remember the first time I traveled far, in a small temple in my hometown, this memory left a deep impression. Even after gaining some fame and titles, seeing other magnificent sights still doesn't compare to the shock I felt that year."

Cui Dongshan understood the old scholar's point and said, "So, Master Ancestor wants Pei Qian to stay by the teacher's side for this reason? To let her feel as though she is always in the Daoist temple, learning Dao through observation? As long as Pei Qian is beside the teacher, it will naturally lead her closer to that level of caution and independence?"

In the Qingming World, there are four great heavenly masters, each versed in profound Daoist methods and possessing unique abilities. Yet, they do not cultivate in Bai Yujing but are responsible for guarding the four corners of the world. One of them, associated with that great spirit official, has a well-known tale that has circulated widely. According to many Daoist texts, it is said that before that spirit official attained enlightenment, he committed numerous acts of violence and was punished by a passing great heavenly master. Afterward, the latter rang the heavenly drum, and Bai Yujing's grand master sent him to follow the great heavenly master on travels for three hundred years, promising that if he made even a single mistake, they would switch places. In the end, for three centuries, that great heavenly master made no errors in speech or action.

The old scholar chuckled silently, "Hasn't Pei Qian also turned towards goodness? Doesn’t that matter anymore? Do you think Pei Qian would be who she is today without the teachings of my closed-door disciples?"

The old scholar patted his chest, "If I am at peace, the world benefits; what could be better?"

The old scholar spoke earnestly, "Accomplishments and knowledge are good, but is it good enough? I doubt it. I’ll just mention three matters: Can we borrow the character from the Grand Scholar? Can we have Mr. Bai retrieve the Mountain Search Map? Can we have one more girl, who seeks goodness and avoids evil, enter the distant travel realm? Scholars cannot think they have done enough and rest easy, believing that the world should not demand more from them. If so, I will spit at the world and curse mankind for their ignorance and lack of conscience."

When the old scholar reached this point, he scratched his head, "Clearing my throat a few times, then spitting a heavy mouthful... damn it... still a bit disgusting."

He was referring to an incident involving smashing a statue, remembering that there was a scholar in the Shao Yuan Dynasty who was particularly enthusiastic about it.

In truth, the old scholar was talking about two different matters, but Cui Dongshan was clever enough to understand. One was about pursuing the original intentions of worldly affairs, and the other was just private grumbling among close acquaintances.

The old scholar continued, "Now that Pei Qian has reached a higher realm, she has become more cautious; this is a good thing. Because her fists are heavy but she is still young, she shouldn't think too early about changing the world."

"The world is the world; it’s merely the path of humanity."

The old scholar casually pointed, "On a misguided path crowded with errors, it may seem a shortcut, regardless of how many people there are or how easy it is to walk. Every teacher must tell every child learning to read and learn etiquette at the school that this is not the way. Once those children grow up and gain some strength, they may have to stand in the way, telling others that this is wrong. Wrong is wrong, and they might end up with a black eye from some worldly misfortune. If your studies can reduce the wrongdoings that fall upon good people, that is the greatest kindness."

Cui Dongshan said gloomily, "Why tell me this and not Cui Qian?"

The old scholar remained silent.

Only the great river flowing before them continued its slow journey.

Cui Dongshan muttered to himself, "To strive for virtue."

After a long silence, Cui Dongshan complained, "Let’s go; everyone has left anyway."

The old scholar said, "I’m going to see a certain predecessor."

That predecessor had once posed a question of great significance, starting with, "Who transmitted the Dao at the beginning of antiquity?" Just this question alone could bring tears to some lonely sages.

The old scholar had once been youthful and spirited, and during a rare drinking session, he had called out, "I will answer it; I can answer it..."

And on the Sword Qi Great Wall, his disciples had once made his junior brother Chen Ping'an respond to it.

Cui Dongshan hesitated and said, "Can we skip the heavenly question?"

It was still a question, yet it was not phrased as one.

Not answering, just lingering, once a teacher, you always remain in my heart.

The old scholar tugged at his beard and patted his belly lightly, "It’s been too long; I need to let it out."

Cui Dongshan curiously asked, "Did Qi Jingchun know that person was at the Shu Jian Lake from the beginning?"

The old scholar shook his head, "I only learned this secret after merging with the Dao. In the past, that old man kept it from me."

Suddenly, the old scholar slapped Cui Dongshan's head, "You little rascal, always cursing yourself as an old bastard, is it fun?"

Cui Dongshan looked at him with mournful eyes, "You said it yourself, after all, you are two people now."

The old scholar slapped him again, "How do you speak to your Master Ancestor, huh?"

Cui Dongshan shielded his head after receiving the slap, “That’s enough, isn't it?”

The old scholar suddenly said, "First, there were sages looking coldly upon the world from Shu Jian Lake. Spirit is the language of the gods. Equal means the tone and inflection of speech. The one who speaks of righteousness and balance is none other than heaven, nurturing all things in harmony, while the most central and harmonious is the earth. Thus, it is the most righteous and balanced. Later, Bai Ye wielded his sword to leave the nation and traveled the world. As for how to name the Fifth World, I have an idea now."

"To be truly pure and clear is to firmly uphold the teachings of the ancients."

Bai Ye's poetry is unmatched, drifting and thinking uncommonly. A truly pure person possesses a grand spirit, floating like clouds in the sky.

Cui Dongshan blinked, "Good."

The old scholar raised a hand, while Cui Dongshan waved his arms frantically to stop that slap.

The old scholar withdrew his hand, stroked his beard, and smiled contentedly, "A single word of goodness won’t suffice; it’s far from enough. So, when it comes to naming, your teacher has truly inherited the essence."

Cui Dongshan grinned, "What about finding a wife?"

The old scholar rubbed his chin thoughtfully, "I’ve never taught that either; it’s self-taught?"

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "If you had taught it, it probably wouldn’t work out." 

And with that, the old scholar walked away./n/nCui Dongshan soared through the clouds, reaching the sea of mist where the true form of Zhi Gui emerged, majestic and powerful as it traversed the grand river. Halfway through its journey, it bore numerous wounds, yet its momentum remained fierce, and the situation was under control.

The old scholar first visited the Book Scroll Lake, where he met an elderly man who was profoundly connected to the water, to the point of being drawn into it. Dressed in formal robes with a broad-brimmed hat, the elder had a lean face and a scholarly presence that transcended the confines of traditional Confucian teachings.

The old scholar performed a respectful bow. The elder returned the gesture with ancient propriety, though his demeanor was far from the rigid orthodoxy of Confucianism.

Afterwards, the elder took the old scholar to a mountain peak. It was here, some time ago, that he had finally managed to obtain some bamboo slips from a young man who appeared worn and haggard. Despite his youth, the young man was not easily deceived.

They had once engaged in a dreamlike exchange, not inquiring about the heavens and the earth, but rather probing the depths of one's heart.

After a long silence, the elder spoke, “I find myself a bit disappointed in my own efforts, feeling I could have done better, yet I’m not as disheartened with the world.”

The old scholar nodded with a smile, saying, “To walk alongside such esteemed gentlemen, even if I can’t match your strides, is still a source of pride for me. If I could enjoy the four large meat buns from Green Paulownia City, I would surely have the strength to reason with others and continue my journey.”

The elder replied, “A disciple can pave the way for the world; he can also close the door on the teachers. Not a bad deal at all.”

The old scholar laughed heartily, “Not bad, not bad at all.”

The elder sighed, “One need not inquire about the warmth or coldness of human feelings. Even without touching the scriptures, I still resent myself.”

The old scholar remarked, “As long as my eyes remain clear and my heart warm, the heavens will surely bless this old scholar.”

The elder chuckled, “Just like your disciple, you’re quite adept at conversation.”

The old scholar shook his head, “When it comes to ‘conversation,’ everyone in the world is younger than me.”

The elder said, “There’s no need to say much about the ‘Heavenly Questions.’ Take the other texts, ‘Mountain Spirits’ and ‘Crossing the River,’ without reservation.”

The old scholar hesitated for a moment.

The elder added, “As for ‘Eastern Lord’ and ‘Summoning the Soul,’ they are the same.”

The old scholar bowed again, this time in gratitude.

The first bow was a greeting; this one was a thanks.

With a sigh, the elder’s figure faded away, leaving four essays suspended in the air.

The old scholar tucked them into his sleeve, also letting out a sigh.

Afterwards, the old scholar entrusted the essays “Mountain Spirits” and “Crossing the River” to Cui Dongshan, who was stationed at the grand river, and instructed him to pass the “Eastern Lord” essay to the local apothecary. Following that, the old scholar carried only the “Summoning the Soul” essay, heading south to the Old Dragon City. He took advantage of the perilous terrain—not a complete quagmire—to make a brief visit to Paulownia Leaf Isle, assisting Taiping Mountain in stabilizing several formations.

Then he ventured to the Great Spring Dynasty, where even the emperor had quietly fled. Outside the Blue Dew Palace by the riverbank, the old scholar tugged at his sleeve, standing there for quite a while, yet no one paid him any mind.

Finally, the old scholar had to ask if the River Goddess of the Underworld was present.

A petite woman swaggered into view, one hand supporting the base of a large bowl and the other holding chopsticks. She sat on the threshold, frowning as she scrutinized the old Confucian scholar, who appeared to have no discernible depth of cultivation. She eventually inquired, “What brings you here, old sir? Don’t you know the world is in disarray? My Blue Dew Palace is but a small place, unable to protect anyone. I might end up in danger myself. It’s not that I’m stingy; you should hurry to the Great Fulu Academy, where things are more stable.”

The old scholar had no choice but to muster the courage to introduce himself, stating that he was the teacher of both Zuo and Chen Ping’an.

The River Goddess of the Underworld seemed struck by lightning, her mind a muddle, her face reddening as she struggled to find the words. She swayed as if drunk, lifting the large bowl above her head, implying that she wanted to treat the venerable Confucian to a late-night meal.

After that, she invited the venerable Confucian, who was too polite to refuse, to sit with her in the main hall of the Blue Dew Palace, where Chef Liu served them a small bowl of noodles as if it were a delicacy.

Ultimately, in a certain area of Paulownia Leaf Isle, outside the territory of the Paulownia Leaf Sect, Zuo, with his sword resting on his knees, sat above the sea of clouds, guarding the gate. Just beyond that door lay two worlds.

In the distance, the Golden Core sword cultivator Wang Shizi and a girl named Yu Xin were aiding a group of academy students and mountain cultivators in escorting displaced persons to safety, a daunting and chaotic task.

Even a dimwit like Wang Shizi could see Yu Xin’s feelings for Zuo. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have taken the risk to come here. Wang Shizi found himself at a critical juncture in his cultivation, much like the sword cultivator Cao Jun from South Posa Isle, needing to observe Zuo’s swordsmanship to break through his bottleneck. After all, Zuo was here, slaying demons with his sword. Even a distant glance could yield invaluable insights into the sword path.

Yet, upon learning that Yu Xin had accompanied him to this place, Zuo had patted Wang Shizi on the shoulder, his expression suggesting that he believed Wang Shizi had finally grasped something.

Today, when Yu Xin asked if he wanted to seek guidance on swordsmanship, Wang Shizi, no longer the naive fool he once was, nodded affirmatively, adding, “Actually, aside from his unrivaled sword skills, Zuo’s Daoist methods are also exceptional. After I consult him, don’t miss out.”

Yu Xin glanced at him, and although Wang Shizi displayed righteous resolve, she refrained from rolling her eyes at him again.

When they arrived at the sea of clouds, temporarily regarded as a place of cultivation by Zuo, Wang Shizi sincerely inquired about sword techniques before taking his leave. He didn’t forget to remind Zuo that Yu Xin had some questions about her cultivation path and wished to consult him.

Zuo shook his head, saying that aside from swordsmanship, he couldn’t teach others anything else. The secret techniques of the Paulownia Leaf Sect’s ancestral hall could directly lead to the upper five realms. As long as Yu Xin followed the steps diligently, she would undoubtedly succeed.

Just as Yu Xin approached, looking like a cloud drifting through the air, she overheard and immediately turned to leave. A few steps out, she suddenly descended, hastily returning to the mundane world.

Wang Shizi trailed after her, daring only to follow from a distance. A girl in sorrow likely preferred to hide her feelings from others, after all.

However, Yu Xin seemed to quickly compose herself, stopping in place as she hovered in the air, neither going to the sea of clouds nor returning to the ground. It was then that Wang Shizi felt safe enough to approach.

Yu Xin looked up at the sea of clouds and quietly asked, “Is Mr. Zuo unable to leave this place, yet longs to return to the Sword Qi Great Wall? Is that why he feels so… conflicted?”

Wang Shizi nodded, responding in thought, “The little junior brother of our esteemed senior, that hidden official, seems to have stayed behind. That’s why Zuo is eager to leave, but with the current situation on Paulownia Leaf Isle, it truly is challenging for him to depart.”

Yu Xin murmured, “He possesses such high sword skills, yet he’s always so troubled?”

Zuo was indeed troubled, unsure of when he could return to the Sword Qi Great Wall and bring his junior brother back.

Yu Xin felt pained. She didn’t want to imagine a day when she could no longer see that seemingly eternally lonely figure. She couldn’t bear the thought of him leaving for good one day.

In this world, there should be a Zuo who doesn’t have to feel conflicted.

Suddenly, an irate old scholar approached the sea of clouds, reaching Zuo’s back. Just as Zuo was about to rise, the old scholar didn’t need to jump; he slapped Zuo on the head, exclaiming, “Are you a fool?! Your teacher didn’t teach you how to find a wife, but neither did he teach you how to remain single for so long!”

Zuo received another slap from his teacher, utterly confused. But he was used to it by now.

Zheng Dafu had left his hometown early, with a clear destination in mind. However, it wasn’t until the fifth year of Jiachun that he obediently followed his master’s orders, no longer heading to the Lotus Root Paradise, but instead leisurely making his way into the Fifth Realm.

This quiet departure from his hometown and his intercontinental journey followed his master’s peculiar route. His first stop was North Julu Island, where he found his senior brother and sister-in-law at the foot of Lion Peak Mountain, enjoying several days of fine wine and food. Surprisingly, his sister-in-law didn’t scold him, even speaking softly to him, which made Zheng Dafu feel a pang of bitterness about his own situation. He hadn’t thought much of it before, but seeing his sister-in-law like that made him realize just how pitiful he truly was.

After feasting to his heart’s content, Zheng Dafu glanced outside at the empty courtyard and kindly offered to help his sister-in-law chop some bamboo on the mountain to make sturdy clotheslines.

Li Er was busy tidying up the dishes and paid him no mind. One day without being scolded, and he might as well not be a disciple anymore.

The woman had initially intended to scold him thoroughly but upon seeing the bearded, hunched man who seemed a head shorter than before, she acted unusually and said it wasn’t necessary. She quickly walked out of the house.

Zheng Dafu sighed deeply, turning to his senior brother and asking why his sister-in-law seemed to be bullied by outsiders, lacking the heroic spirit she had back home.

Li Er had just finished cleaning up the dishes when the woman returned, carrying two jugs of wine and a few plates of snacks, urging the brothers to have a good chat, as it had been so long since they last met, and they would soon part ways again. It wouldn’t hurt to drink a little more.

At that moment, the woman slightly regained her former demeanor, pointing at Zheng Dafu and scolding him for not staying home to guard the door. Even if he didn’t earn much, it was still a stable life. What was so appealing out there? With a face like his, standing at the door at night could ward off evil spirits, more effective than a door god. Without any real skills, how could he expect to entice women to bear his children?

Her scolding instantly refreshed Zheng Dafu’s spirit. He hurriedly invited his sister-in-law to sit down and drink, promising that if he got drunk today, he would sleep like a dead man, not even hearing the thunder, let alone sleepwalking and stumbling around.

She was furious and left the house, hesitating momentarily before ultimately not staying at the shop. Instead, she sought out a few women she had good relations with to inquire if there were any suitable young women around, thinking perhaps Zheng Dafu might be a decent match after all.

In his early years, Zheng Dafu, when guarding the door or drinking on the street, enjoyed boasting about the size of beautiful women, comparing chests and bottoms, his eyes never idle, his hands even less so, and his mouth never quiet, saying he had lost his soul among their garments, hoping to find a partner. 

Such a worthless fellow, who couldn’t even bring a wife home, lamented his unlucky fate. In the end, a lustful old bachelor with dishonest intentions couldn’t gather the courage to find a proper woman as a wife. It was to be expected; with his looks and lack of prospects, who would want to endure hardship with him? 

While the woman scolded him, she secretly urged her husband to help his junior brother find a way out. If all else failed, they could try to get him a decent job at Yang’s shop or the Dragon Kiln, and if he could find a suitable unmarried girl from the neighborhood, they could set something up. Even if he had to marry into her family, as long as Zheng Dafu spoke fewer crude words, whether as a shop assistant, a farmer, or a woodcutter, he could at least support a small household.

Once the woman left, Li Er began discussing serious matters with his junior brother, “Just hang in there until we get there and break through. You know how to manage this situation; since Master has returned your remaining soul, don’t waste it. If you accidentally break through during your travels, it could lead to trouble. Fuyao Isle is too far from Baoping Isle, and it would be difficult for Master to help you find your way, nor would it be appropriate for him to intervene.”

At Lion Peak, Li Er helped Zheng Dafu train, finally allowing him to return to the sixth realm of martial arts. Although he still had a long way to go before reaching the peak of his former martial prowess, it was not a significant issue. Moreover, Zheng Dafu had newly forged a brave heart of a warrior, which was no small feat. After all, he was a pure martial artist who had once earned the title of ‘strongest.’ Having endured hardship, his spirit had not faltered, which was the best tempering of fortunes and misfortunes.

A pure martial artist's prowess in boxing depends on the vigor and length of their spirit. Before throwing a punch, one must hold the ambition to make the heavens and the earth tremble.

Zheng Dafu placed one leg on the bench, took a sip of wine, and nodded, “I’m aware.”

When the woman returned home, hoping to share good news with her husband, whether it would come to fruition depended on Zheng Dafu’s own fortune. However, she found that Zheng Dafu was already absent from home, and she hadn’t seen him on the way back either. At the wine table, only two empty jugs remained, and the dishes were finished.

The woman wondered aloud, “He left just like that?”

Li Er replied with a grunt.

She sighed and sat down, gazing outside. “I wonder how you men think. You don’t understand what draws you to the world.”

She referred not only to the perpetually unruly Zheng Dafu but also to Chen Ping’an, whom she regarded as half a son-in-law.

Li Er found himself at a loss for words. He stood up to clean the table again, bending down to pick up Zheng Dafu’s jug and shaking it gently, realizing it was completely empty.

Seeing this, the woman scolded with a laugh, “Look at your lack of ambition.”

Li Er hesitated, his expression awkward.

Outside, guests had arrived.

The woman tentatively asked, “What’s this? You’re not planning to travel far, are you?”

Li Er scratched his head.

Indeed, he intended to make a trip to the Bone Marsh, where his daughter was still located, and he felt uneasy about it. Moreover, it was only right that he put in some effort.

Had it not been for his son Li Huai and junior brother Zheng Dafu arriving here one after another, Li Er would have already discussed it with his wife. Recently, a couple of guests had come to Lion Peak, planning to visit the southern sea of the Bone Marsh. One was a renowned sword immortal from the Taihui Sword Sect who had helped Qi Jinglong with his sword inquiries, and the other an old martial artist who had just regained some clarity of mind and free will.

Both were now waiting outside for Li Er’s news.

One was a well-known sword immortal from North Julu Island, and the other a tenth realm martial artist who had once provoked multiple sword immortals to surround and beat him.

They were all waiting for Li Er, or more precisely, for him to persuade his wife to allow him to travel far.

This didn’t seem too strange, as the men from North Julu Island were famously fearless, except when it came to their own women.

The woman slammed the table angrily, “Are you wild just because you drank a bit of horse piss with Zheng Dafu and heard a few crude words?!”

She lamented loudly, “Oh, what a miserable life I have! My son is the most filial and understanding, yet he’s rarely around. My daughter is so stubborn, looks like her mother, yet has her father’s lack of talent. In the end, she’s become an old maid, unable to marry... Who can I blame? I chose a useless man back in the day, one with no skills. After a drink, he’s lost even the little decent spirit he had. In the end, he’s just a heartless man, dreaming every day about the young women wandering by, flaunting their chests and swaying their hips. If I can't blame myself, who else can I blame...”

Li Er remained silent, not daring to interject.

The woman wiped her eyes, “He seems like a simple and honest man, yet inside he’s full of tricks and rotten thoughts. What kind of karma have I created, ending up with a man like you as the pillar of the family…”

Li Er glanced outside, at the sword immortal watching the commotion, who exchanged a few teasing remarks with the old martial artist. 

Li Er ignored them, informing them that they should head out first, as he would not arrive later than them at the Bone Marsh.

The sword immortal turned to leave, while the old martial artist shared a few more laughs. The sword immortal then struck up another conversation, and they both appeared quite lively.

Li Er frowned./n/n“Are these two asking for a beating?” 

The woman caught a glimpse of Li Er’s furrowed brow from the corner of her eye. It was an unprecedented situation, and her heart sank even further. She leaned on the table, feigning a show of tears earlier, but now she genuinely felt anxious and heartbroken. Softening her voice, she whimpered, “Now they dare to throw me a tantrum. I can’t live like this anymore. They won’t say it out loud, but in their hearts, they resent me as a nagging old hag…”

Li Er sat down beside her and gently patted her hand. He explained softly, “Liu Er is out there on her own, and I plan to go check on her. I’ll be back home soon.”

The woman lifted her head, her expression doubtful. “Are you going to help Li Huai and Li Liu find some vixen to be their second wife?”

Li Er shook his head. “You know I can’t do such shameless things.”

He couldn’t even bear to repeat what his wife had said. 

Watching Li Er’s expression, the woman murmured, “Actually, Li Huai and Da Feng are just like that; they come and go as they please. I can tell your mind isn’t here whenever you zone out. Go on, be careful on the road. Even if you learn from Da Feng’s flirtations, don’t let him take advantage of you out there. But of course, it’s best if you don’t learn anything at all.”

Li Er nodded, wiping the corner of her eyes. When she asked when he would leave, he replied he would set out today, the earlier he left, the sooner he’d return. The woman got up to help pack their belongings. 

Outside, an old man’s cursing continued endlessly. Li Er, who had been patiently waiting at the door for the packages, suddenly stood up and strode out. Hearing the commotion, the woman, who had been dawdling, quickly asked Li Er what he was going out for. He replied casually, “There’s a dog barking outside.”

Zheng Dafeng traveled from North Canglu Continent to White Snow Continent, passing through Liuxia Continent and Jinjia Continent, and finally entering the gate in the middle of Fuyiao Continent. As he was just a martial artist from another continent and not at the Golden Body level, he managed to enter the Fifth Realm with a bag of gold coins.

The Fuyiao Continent was different from the Tongye Continent, where everyone below the Nascent Soul could seek refuge. Not to mention Golden Core Earth Immortals; even the middle-level cultivators of their continent generally couldn’t expect to cross the gates. The amount of divine money needed would make even an entire sect or a top-level cultivator feel the pinch. Moreover, it wasn’t enough to just have money; one needed a higher-level master or fellow disciple who had died fighting on the eastern coast of Fuyiao Continent to earn a pass, which led many desperate old cultivators, particularly those whose souls were decaying, to flock to the coastal areas.

This was to pave a way for their juniors and offer a risky yet opportunity-filled path for cultivation.

The customs of Fuyiao Continent reflected this reality. The mountains and valleys were interconnected, accustomed to fighting to the death, making them far more spirited than the stagnant waters of Tongye Continent.

As Zheng Dafeng’s feet touched the ground of this realm, he quietly ascended to the Golden Body level, though without the blessings of martial luck. The reason was simple: among the martial artists of this realm, there was a remarkable talent at the sixth level who had honed his physique. The only reason he came here was that he couldn’t find any martial luck in the Haoran realm and sought to take advantage of this place. Such a person was not someone Zheng Dafeng valued as a companion. 

Zheng Dafeng was indifferent to the concept of martial luck. Whether he entered the seventh, eighth, or even ninth realm with the strongest sixth level was of no importance to him. He was not in a rush at all; if the old man were worried about it, he would have sent him to Tongye Continent to wait. In fact, the old man had advised him long ago not to regard martial luck as a given; it was meaningless. The primary focus should be on breaking through, and reaching the tenth realm as soon as possible would be sufficient.

At the latest, within a hundred years, he should at least reach the peak of the Mountain Summit realm. Otherwise, he might as well just wait to eat and die in this realm.

Zheng Dafeng planned to take a look at the center of the world, as he had heard that the Sword Qi Great Wall was located at the city left behind from the great war known as "Ascension."

Around the same time Zheng Dafeng entered this new realm, Huang Ting, the female disciple of Taiping Mountain from Tongye Continent, who had been stuck at the Nascent Soul level, crossed another gate into this world. Traveling alone with her sword, she moved swiftly, and after a month, she finally paused to rest. Choosing a mountain that caught her eye, she decided to nurture her sword intent there. Unexpectedly, she attracted the attention of a strange being. Good fortune smiled upon her; she broke through and entered the Jade Purity realm, discovering an excellent location for cultivation, rich in spiritual energy and natural treasures beyond her imagination.

When it came to luck and destiny, Huang Ting had always been fortunate. Otherwise, the renowned He Xiaoliang from Baoping Continent wouldn’t have been called her second.

After entering the Jade Purity realm, Huang Ting erected a stone monument on the mountain peak, inscribing “Taiping Mountain” in sword characters, and then descended to wander around, hoping to encounter some familiar faces.

She had always enjoyed the tales of the Jianghu.

During her journey south, Huang Ting encountered a young, unassuming scholar in black clothing. However, they merely exchanged glances.

Earlier, the black-clad scholar seemed to recognize her, folding his fan and stopping to nod in greeting.

Huang Ting ignored him.

As she saw more and more cultivators traveling north, Huang Ting learned that the old immortals of Tongye Continent had seemingly begun “moving mountains.” Besides the increasingly heavy atmosphere on the old mountains, there were also some new developments. For instance, among the current practitioners of various schools, those who could calculate directions and select suitable locations for travel, such as the Yin-Yang practitioners, the Feng Shui masters who could accurately assess treasure locations, and farmers, herbalists, and merchants skilled in making money, had all become highly sought after. In short, any Qi practitioners who could aid in the construction of mountains were now in high demand.

As for the once notorious four difficult spirits of the mountains—the sword cultivators, military strategists, legalists, and the female disciples of the Knife Room—they had all been rendered obsolete due to the collapse of the Upside Down Mountain. The dynamics of the world had drastically changed; nowadays, besides the center, the sword cultivators were indeed scarce in the east, west, south, and north. Military cultivators were often forcibly conscripted for battles back home, and the legalists faced the same fate. As for the female disciples of the Knife Room, there were likely very few left even in the Haoran realm.

In this new world, by the fifth year of Jia Chun, the situation had become increasingly chaotic.

Both a martial artist at the Golden Body bottleneck and a cultivator, Yang Ningzhen had taken on the alias Yang Hengxing. Along with his younger brother Yang Ningxing, who had already refined the treasured mirror of Baoping Mountain, the two entered the Fifth Realm one after another without even greeting each other, not even considering a reunion.

As a small celestial from the Chongxuan Bureau’s Yunxiao Palace, Yang Ningxing had gathered the elemental treasures of the five elements and came here solely to break through into the Jade Purity realm and ascend to become an immortal.

There was an unknown Qi practitioner named Shu Zhongshu, whose origins were unclear, who occupied a picturesque spot and built a transcendent platform, setting prohibitions that forbade any Earth Immortal from entering within three hundred miles; otherwise, they would be killed without mercy. This individual had several maidservants named Xiao Ping, Jiang Se, Cai Yi, Da Xian, and Hua Ying, all of whom were middle-level sword cultivators.

Ji Hai, the sect master of the Fuji Sect, specialized in writing green and blue verses to invite gods and even spirits.

Ji Hai summoned a divine general named “Catching Willow” and a ghostly immortal named “Flower Seal.” Both were at the Nascent Soul level and joined forces to protect the next sect master of the Fuji Sect as they entered this new realm.

A young man in white with a flowing sash, who appeared to be a wild cultivator from the mountains, did not rush to travel after entering this world from Tongye Continent. Instead, he started wandering around, specifically choosing Qi practitioners who were poets, lyricists, musicians, and essayists. These individuals, upon entering the new realm in a hurry, began loudly reciting their poetry and songs—heroic ballads, frontier poems, lyrical verses, and even the delicate complaints of the boudoir—all in hopes of resonating with this new world, seeking harmony between their works and the greater universe.

After losing interest in all of that, the young man finally began to travel alone. Eventually, he sat down by a riverside, where the water and clouds danced vibrantly. He took out brush and ink, closed his eyes, and with memory as his guide, painted a long scroll depicting mountains and rivers, naming it “Mustard Seed.” The scroll bore only a single ink dot but was titled “Mountains and Rivers.”

The young man produced two seals, stamping one on the “Mustard Seed” scroll, inscribing “In harmony with the moonlight at the white cloud and azure stone’s fair spot,” while the other on the “Mountains and Rivers” scroll, inscribing “Once intoxicated by plum blossoms for a decade, then misled by osmanthus brew for half a lifetime.”

The young man reclined back, using his arms as a pillow, murmuring with a smile, “What moves my heart are the bright moon, beautiful women, falling snow, and the light of swords.”

The city of the Sword Qi Great Wall had just been named Ascension City.

Lu Chen returned to the Qingming realm, and Sun Daolong had already taken the lead, returning to the Xuandu Temple.

Lu Chen arrived at the White Jade Capital and encountered his tall senior brother. Lazily, he leaned against the highest railing of the tallest city among the five, smiling, “There’s no need to be angry. In Xuandu Temple, from Sun Daolong to the youngest acolyte, everyone has feelings toward you.”

Lu Chen watched the clouds rise and fall like tides at sea, softly saying, “It’s a reasonable principle to allow family members to have a little emotion.”

For this Grand Master of the White Jade Capital, the entire Qingming realm, whether or not they were cultivators, all dwelled under one roof.

Many emotions defied reason, yet Lu Chen said that was precisely the principle.

The tall Daoist remained silent.

Lu Chen turned around, leaning against the railing and stretching lazily. “Who would help outsiders and not help senior brothers? Five hundred spirit officials, that’s no mistake.”

Dao Lao Er remarked, “Is that fellow still being pressed by Tuo Yue Mountain?”

Lu Chen laughed, “He can’t blame anyone else; after all, back in the day, he was a guest and would scribble on the shoe soles, one saying Dao Lao Er and the other saying Lu Chen. Now he’s facing the consequences, huh?”

On Tongye Continent, the boundaries between the mountains and the valleys were starkly defined. First, the immortal forces of this continent were not as numerous as those of other continents. Secondly, the cultivators of Tongye had long grown accustomed to sweeping the snow in front of their own doors, showing far less interest in the bustling markets below than the rest of the eight continents in the Haoran realm.

Furthermore, Tongye Continent spanned vast territories, which meant many remote areas on this continent were unaware that the world had long since become unsettled.

In a remote vassal kingdom’s capital, a wealthy family, both official and scholarly, had an elderly man in his seventies explaining the significance of a royal porcelain bowl gifted by the Emperor and a royal inkstone awarded by the King to his newly literate grandson. He elaborated on why the Retreat Thought Hall crafted this bowl and why the Advancement Thinking Hall made this inkstone, explaining the essence of retreating to think and advancing to think.

In a small county town, a little girl practiced bending and curling her fingers like the opera performers, while the young men and women paid her no mind. An elder saw her and scolded her a few times.

A traveling scholar rested at an inn, flipping through the notes from the literati of a previous dynasty. He found it curious that well water could tell the time and that the flower growing in the palace had its own rules.

A man with a mouth full of gold teeth led a group of rascals, living a life of luxury with abundant food and drink in his hometown. He had only heard rumors of immortals on the mountains but felt no envy whatsoever.

In a prefectural city, there was a profession specializing in the imitation of certain famous calligraphers and painters, capable of producing works that could easily deceive even the discerning. They charged exorbitantly per character and were currently haggling with a long-time client.

Then, one day, everything was gone.

Under a dense cloud cover, a hole suddenly opened in the sky above a coastal immortal mountain of Tongye Continent. Sunlight poured down, weapons clattered to the ground, and a great demon crashed heavily to the earth.

Another boulder as large as a mountain tilted and crashed into the majestic city of a dynasty.

On top of the massive stone was a slender girl, dragging a sword, followed by armored puppets that shook the ground with every step.

In the sixth year of Jia Chun in this Fifth Realm, the vast Tongye Continent had fallen, except for three academies and a dozen immortal mountains.

During this time, a man named Zhong Kui, once a gentleman from an academy, emerged to turn the tide.

Meanwhile, in the waters of Fuyiao Continent, Cao Ci broke through to the tenth realm during a fierce battle at sea, turning the tide against a great demon.

In the icy plains of White Snow Continent, a group of northern cultivators hunting demons encountered a formidable beast. Trapped in a desperate situation, they could only flee southward. Exhausted, they stood waiting for their doom when a young woman appeared, slowly walking out from the white snow, holding a walking stick and carrying a green bamboo box.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 822: The Eleventh of the World**

Amidst the swirling snow and wind, a slender figure emerged. The vast whiteness of the world accentuated her slightly darker skin, making her appear even more conspicuous. Her hair was styled into a playful bun, revealing her high forehead, devoid of any adornments or hairpins.

As the young woman stood firm, roughly ten paces away from the group of bewildered hunters, she pulled out a meticulously crafted geomantic map from the northern region of Aiai Continent, stored in the treasury of Lion Peak. After a quick glance, she noted that the nearest celestial abode on the mountains was the Zhanfan Daoist Temple, located in the northern territory of Aiai Continent. Unlike the sects of the "Zong" character, this temple was relatively peaceful. The city below was Tuili City, part of the Rainworker Kingdom, known for its Lin Tan Prefecture. She tucked the map back into her sleeve, first offering a respectful salute to the crowd before speaking in the refined dialect of Aiai Continent, "May I ask how far we are from Tuili City?"

An elderly cultivator rose cautiously, his voice trembling, "Senior, are you Master Liu?"

This was the best-case scenario. The worst, however, would be if she were actually a powerful demon in human guise, toying with them like fish on a hook.

On the vast ice plains, four formidable demons each ruled their territory. The southernmost one claimed the name Xiliu, often seen riding a snow-white lion as he patrolled his domain. Rumor had it that he preferred to manifest as a handsome man. Over a decade ago, he had engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Master Liu, who had come to the area to "earn some pocket money for cosmetics and gather a dowry." Even those far away in Tuili City felt the overwhelming aura of that battle. Though severely injured, Master Liu had turned misfortune into fortune, breaking through a bottleneck in the strongest travel realm to successfully reach the Ninth Realm. It seemed Xiliu had suffered significant injuries as well, retreating into seclusion ever since. 

In the years that followed, cultivators from Aiai Continent had taken advantage of the temporarily weakened demons in the southern ice plains, banding together to hunt the various creatures and gather precious materials without restraint. 

However, Xiliu had two loyal generals guarding his territory. One was a rogue demonic cultivator, self-styled as the Autumn Water Daoist, and the other was an old demoness with a wrinkled face, carrying a large burlap sack. When she spotted cultivators, she would smile and say, "Looks like we have a fresh meal for our young master Xiliu. Thank you, everyone."

Both were rarely seen together, and any unfortunate encounter could leave one’s fate in the hands of the next life.

In fact, there had once been another tyrannical demon in the southern ice plains, but that one had been skinned by the Master Liu that the old cultivator had mentioned.

Pei Qian shook her head. "No."

The honorific title made her uncomfortable. However, being in a foreign land and meeting by chance, where intentions could be hidden, she chose not to reveal her own name.

Pei Qian was aware of who this so-called Master Liu was. A Ninth Realm martial artist, she was named Liu Suiyu, a registered devotee of the Liu family, the wealthiest in Aiai Continent, and the one most likely to become the second Tenth Realm martial artist. Previously, while practicing punches on Lion Peak, Elder Li Er had casually mentioned the martial arts landscape of Aiai Continent and the names of its masters. The top martial artist of Aiai Continent was Pei Axiang, known for her peculiar surname and even stranger name, nicknamed "Thunder God." Her fists were powerful, and her residence was a humble Thunder God Temple, little known to the world.

Liu Suiyu was one of Pei Axiang’s three direct disciples. This old martial artist, renowned for both training and teaching, had fought countless battles on her path to the pinnacle of martial arts, partly due to the name "Axiang." One such battle was against the oldest Tenth Realm martial artist in the northern regions, Wang Fuxue, over the latter’s habit of referring to her as "Axiang Sister," bragging that the martial arts of Axiang from Aiai Continent were very masculine.

It was said that after returning from the sea, though battered and bruised, Wang Fuxue remained spirited. When asked about the outcome by friends on the mountain, he merely scoffed, "How heavy could the fists of a girl from Aiai Continent be?" The outcome of that Tenth Realm duel was clear. After that, Pei Axiang had indeed secluded herself in Thunder God Temple, not seen for decades.

Later, Gu You and the Sword Immortal Ji Yue both died, leaving the northern regions without a Tenth Realm martial artist. The news from Aiai Continent was far more extensive than that of the northern regions, mostly filled with schadenfreude.

The assembled cultivators were on edge, hesitant to approach the unknown young woman.

In the ice plains, demons were known to be eccentric. Could this woman truly be passing by and choose to save them? Or was she simply toying with them like a cat with a mouse? 

Hunting demons in Aiai Continent was a perilous business, where one’s life hung by a thread. Thus, it was crucial to go in numbers. Each hunter venturing into the ice plains would sign a life-and-death contract with the Northern Summit Alliance, clearly stating the terms for compensation. Of course, if they returned empty-handed or suffered total annihilation, everything would be over.

Typically, a minimum of three people would team up: one as the formation master responsible for setting traps—this role was crucial. A pure martial artist or soldier should carry both a defensive heavy weapon and an offensive treasure, tasked with luring demons into the forbidden zone of the formation, as they were the most physically resilient and could both protect themselves and stall those tough-skinned demons, preventing an immediate collapse if they encountered a demon. Additionally, there needed to be a Qi practitioner skilled in water techniques to seize the advantage of time and terrain, coordinating their techniques to slay the demons.

If the leader could gather a five-member team, they would often add a formidable Qi practitioner, known for the so-called "one deadly strike," to deal a fatal blow during the encirclement. They might also include an alchemist cultivator to assist in prolonged combat. This way, the hunting team would be able to attack and retreat, ensuring that even if the ice plains expedition yielded nothing, they could at least preserve their lives and safely retreat to Tuili City or the Zhanfan Daoist Temple to regroup.

Yet, even with companions, unforeseen accidents were common.

Today, they had set out without consulting the almanac and encountered a Golden Core demon.

Pei Qian understood their concerns and did not wish to elaborate. She needed only to head straight south to Tuili City for a brief respite, and their doubts would naturally dissipate.

Whether traveling through Northern Julu Continent with Li Huai or now wandering alone in Aiai Continent, Pei Qian focused solely on her training, never aspiring to make friends or acquaintances like her master. As long as there was mutual affinity, she would drink without asking names.

Pei Qian believed she could not achieve that.

Just as Cui Dongshan privately thought, as long as her teacher, Chen Ping'an, was not beside her, the vast world outside the Lotus Flower Blessed Land still revolved around the streets and alleys of the capital of the Southern Garden Kingdom. For Pei Qian, apart from her master and the destitute mountain, her journey through the martial world had hardly changed—it was difficult to alter that fact in the past, present, or future.

Suddenly, Pei Qian halted, plunging her walking stick into the snow with force. She declared to them, "You all go ahead, hurry to Tuili City, and be careful on the way. Danger still lurks."

Then, Pei Qian furrowed her brow, glancing at the distance behind the group of Qi practitioners.

It was somewhat too late.

Besides an old woman, who appeared to be shuffling awkwardly yet moved with surprising speed, carrying a large burlap sack, the snow and wind parted before her as she advanced. The old woman stopped about a hundred paces from Pei Qian, coughing persistently, squinting her eyes, and rasping, "What a fierce little girl with her fists. Heading south, yet you’re willing to leave behind all those demon cores for us to find. A pure martial artist like you, practicing for the sake of training without seeking wealth, is truly more contemptible than that lunatic named Liu."

Alongside the old woman, on the path south taken by the hunters, there was a barefoot Taoist clad in a crane cloak, trudging through the snow while loudly reciting the Taoist classic "Nanhua Qiushui." The Taoist held several branches of blooming plum blossoms, occasionally plucking a few to chew on while mixing them with snow, swallowing both with each bite. With every chew, a radiant glow emanated from his meridians, presenting a striking aura of a successful cultivator.

North and south, they blocked the path.

Seeing that the old woman and the barefoot Taoist had no immediate intention of attacking, Pei Qian stepped forward, quickly reaching the side of the old cultivator. She removed a bamboo box and reminded the gathering cultivators, "You focus on forming your defenses. If possible, under the premise of ensuring your safety, help me look after this box. If things get urgent, each of you should flee. I will do my best to protect you."

Pei Qian paused a moment before adding, "I will try my best."

Since the old woman and the barefoot Taoist were clearly targeting her, Pei Qian felt it was only right to throw a few punches, both for others and herself. In the martial world, one must uphold righteousness.

Earlier, she had casually slain a demon to save those cultivators, and it had truly been a casual act. Since she had the strength, she should throw her punches without expecting anything in return.

As for the goodwill and malice of the world, what relation did it have with Pei Qian's training and striking? None.

What mattered to Pei Qian were only her teacher's teachings and the拳法 passed down by Elder Cui—just those two things.

The old woman cast another glance at the green bamboo staff left behind by the young woman. Earlier, when she focused her gaze, she found it impossible to fully see through the illusion, only vaguely sensing the chilling aura emanating from the staff. This was a significant reason why the old woman had not rushed into action.

An old demoness like her, who had cultivated in the ice plains, feared provoking the Liu family disciples of Aiai Continent more than anything, and she was also wary of the direct disciples of Pei Axiang from the Thunder God Temple. Beyond that, she had no worries. Whether they were chewed raw or stewed, it mattered not. Apart from those two types of individuals, occasionally sects bearing the "Zong" character would come here to train, but they often had Yuan Ying Earth Immortals to protect them. The old woman had enough discernment to know that the opponents would generally exercise caution. Those delicate young disciples would not strike too harshly, nor could they.

Pei Qian turned to the old woman, whose expression shifted between doubt and certainty. "I am merely passing through. I have not provoked you. But if I find myself outmatched and become a meal for demons, I accept that. My fists may be strong, but if demons wish to eat people and are killed, they cannot blame me for hitting hard."

The old woman chuckled, "From the traces of your punches and your path, it seems you landed in the north and have been heading south ever since? Little girl, are you from another continent? Northern Julu or Liuxia? How could your elders let you travel alone across the entire ice plain from north to south?"

The old woman’s greatest confusion was why the young girl was allowed to swagger through the territory of her enemy, Xiliu, right under her nose. If not for the fear of attracting trouble, she would have struck long ago. The skirmishes along the way were all fought by Sixth Realm cultivators. Even if they held back and concealed their strength, a mere girl at most in the Golden Body realm would surely die.

Pei Qian replied, "You need not attempt to test my background with words. I will accept your challenge, whether it be with fists or swords."

An elderly cultivator, anxious, whispered, "Senior, regardless of her true identity, we can scare her off by claiming she’s a Liu family disciple. Otherwise, in this encirclement, it’s hard for you to fight against four hands, especially since there are surely many demons controlled by that old woman. In Aiai Continent, the Liu family disciples are the greatest talisman of protection. Master Pei and Senior Liu are both devotees of the Liu family. As a martial artist, you could easily disguise yourself as a third-generation disciple of the Thunder God Temple..."

Pei Qian's voice was firm. "I have my own teacher; I dare not speak out of turn."

The old cultivator sighed deeply, not daring to insist further. In life-and-death situations, there was no time for rigid formalities. 

At this point, no one questioned the identity of the senior any longer.

It was indeed unnecessary.

That Autumn Water Daoist alone was enough to crush all the hunting cultivators except her.

For cultivators from Aiai Continent, whether they were disciples of the classic schools or wandering practitioners, even if they had not personally encountered those exalted beings of the Fifth Realm and above, they were generally aware through the mess of news reports that their numbers were not significantly fewer than those in Northern Julu and certainly more than those in the northwest Liuxia.

However, when it came to Eighth and Ninth Realm martial artists, they were truly few and far between, far less than in Northern Julu, and even fewer than in Liuxia.

The martial fortune of Aiai Continent was notoriously meager. The legendary Tenth Realm martial artist was but one, Pei Axiang of the Thunder God Temple, who had once lost to Wang Fuxue, who later went mad and was captured by the Sword Immortal. Northern Julu had once possessed a sword cultivator who crossed the seas, and even after Gu You's death, they still had one more limit-breaking martial artist than Aiai Continent. This left the mountain practitioners of Aiai Continent feeling rather low, especially since the Liu family, as the first among cultivators, had publicly expressed that their skills could at most match half of those of the Fire Dragon True Man of the Paragons of the Peak. This made Aiai Continent's cultivators feel as if, apart from wealth, they were vastly inferior to the "Northern" faction of Julu.

Pei Qian glanced at the barefoot Taoist cloaked in a crane robe. She had seen records in the book "The Immortal's Tome" purchased by her junior brother from the Upside-Down Mountain. There was indeed a historical mountain Taoist who loved to recite "Nanhua Qiushui," traveling barefoot through the world, rumored to wear an iron crown of the Taoist sect, seeking to cleanse his insides with the blossoms of plum and snow, carving decay into white bones to form a Taoist temple, willing to reveal his path after completing his cultivation and return to the heavens. He had no fixed abode, wandering far, and his iron staff could transform into a blue dragon upon being thrown.

That elusive mountain Taoist was a genuine, accomplished being, and certainly not the pretender blocking the path before her.

Although Pei Qian had yet to strike her stance, the moment she focused, her mind cleared. As she held her breath and concentrated, she began to unleash her intent. Her eyes began to see visions.

In a fleeting moment, everything fell silent. It felt as if only Pei Qian existed in the world, an unrestrained being, free to move without hindrance.

Yet deep down, Pei Qian knew that the stillness she perceived was not a true halt of time; rather, the flow around her seemed to slow to an excruciating crawl.

The closer the danger approached, the more the flow of time seemed to freeze.

In her solitary practice, Pei Qian essentially had but one purpose: to try and make the river of time appear as if it had come to a complete standstill, allowing her body and mind to move freely. When she unleashed her punches, no martial artist would be able to question her; in their presence, they would have to witness her countless strikes!

Of course, her master was the exception. Pei Qian practiced her punches solely to catch up with her master, never daring to hope to stand alongside him in martial arts.

During their travels along the Sword Qi Great Wall, her master had once said something peculiar: he wanted to learn this divine ability from his first disciple.

Her master’s jokes were indeed quite entertaining.

Why would her master learn from a disciple?

But this once heartwarming joke, which had made Pei Qian smile secretly and beam, was becoming less and less amusing. The fact that her master had not returned home day after day, year after year, turned what had once been a comforting joke into a cage that made her heart ache, nearly suffocating her and making her want to shatter it with a punch. Earlier, when she had chosen to travel across continents, abandoning her ability to fly and opting to tread the waves instead, every punch she delivered had aimed for that invisible river of time.

In an instant, the old woman lost sight of the young martial artist./n/n“Is that really the anticipated Golden Body Realm? Whether they are cultivators or pure martial artists, while their realm might be obscured, age is something that can usually be discerned based on their bone structure, as long as the difference in cultivation isn’t too vast. That woman clearly doesn’t look to be over thirty. Could she really be a new third-generation disciple from the Lei Gong Temple’s Pei Ah Xiang lineage? Otherwise, among the younger generation of talented martial artists in the Aiai Continent, there’s no one like her! In Aiai Continent, any Golden Body Realm martial artist under forty is a celebrity, and Liu Caishen has a saying that’s widely circulated, ‘Unfortunately, I can’t smash my way to martial fortune with divine money.’”

In a moment of desperation, the old woman turned around, and the large burlap bag behind her suddenly expanded, shielding her figure. 

With a resounding crack, a punch struck the old woman’s protected back, shattering the wind and snow within a radius of several dozen yards. 

The old woman, with her back to the attacking girl, was utterly defenseless. She was propelled off the ground and sent flying straight ahead, not even given the chance to change her trajectory, showcasing the sheer weight of that punch. 

At the same time, the old woman vaguely sensed a gust of fierce wind brushing past her, a blurred figure leaping over her and rushing forward. Then, a few dozen yards away, the opponent slid and suddenly twisted her body, delivering another punch directly at the old woman. Startled, the old woman had no time to think; she used a Golden Core as the core of her personal world, spinning it rapidly within her life energy center, igniting countless golden rays that intertwined with her three souls and seven spirits, desperately stabilizing her trembling soul. She then projected her shadow outwards, drifting back, leaving her body behind while summoning two precious items for offense, preparing to unleash her techniques to prevent the fierce girl from becoming too rampant.

The other precious item, left within her body, was driven by the Golden Core, suddenly glowing brilliantly. An intricate and mysterious formation appeared around the old woman, a pavilion built from countless strands of snow-white silk, crystalline and ethereal, resembling a glass fairyland. Atop the petite pavilion, a tiny old woman of thumb height sat, fingers forming seals to continuously draw the great snow water energy from heaven and earth, stabilizing the formation.

However, the old woman, who had set up this defensive stance, did not wait for that fearsome second punch.

One practitioner was surprisingly adept at manipulating talismans, vanishing in an instant.

The barefooted man in the crane cloak, holding a plum branch, had originally intended to take advantage of the chaos and target a Qi Practitioner to relieve his boredom. He had just plucked a plum blossom with his fingers, ready to toss it lightly at someone.

As for the identity of the young woman, he had roughly gauged her strength; she was indeed a Golden Body Realm with an impressive physique. Although rare, she was still inferior to the distant traveler, Liu Suoyu, from back then.

Just as the barefooted man, who called himself the Autumn Water Daoist, felt a twinge of unease, his body began to glow with white light, and he was about to cast a spell to escape.

Yet, for no apparent reason, a strange inertia struck him. The once radiant crane cloak was forcibly pulled back into its original form, as if the scattered snowflakes were being compressed into a snowball. This self-proclaimed demonic cultivator, the Autumn Water Daoist, reappeared as if he were a dazed goose, taking a direct punch from the young woman.

Pei Qian also withdrew her fist after delivering the blow.

The Autumn Water Daoist fell into a pit in the snow, sitting on the ground. He inhaled deeply, chewing the plum blossoms he had gathered, blood streaming from his seven orifices, but the gruesome sight disappeared in an instant.

He stood up, shaking off the snowflakes from his cloak, and bowed towards the distance, calling out to his master.

Pei Qian reached out and summoned her walking stick from afar.

Facing both the old woman and the barefooted man, Pei Qian didn’t employ her divine beating technique.

Because the real enemy was not either of them.

Once she exerted her strength to kill one of them, it would be of no use and would only place her in true peril.

In fact, she had detected that shadow even before the old woman and the Autumn Water Daoist.

In the distance, a young nobleman stood atop a snow-white lion, watching the battlefield with an amused expression.

The ruler of the southern region of the Aiai Continent. The jade purity realm demon, Xi Liu.

Pei Qian didn’t consider a jade purity realm to be that formidable.

Because she had been to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Suddenly, the snow-white lion appeared beside the old woman, and Xi Liu did not hide his curiosity, observing the young woman who was very likely a traveler in the distant realm. He smiled and said, “Firstly, we, the hidden demons of the icy plains, rarely initiate attacks in the south. Secondly, you are a remarkably law-abiding passerby; I won’t make things difficult for you. Therefore, there’s no need for us to escalate matters too much. As long as you are willing to leave and hand over this group to my friend, the Autumn Water Daoist, we can call it even.”

Xi Liu smiled again, “Of course, there’s another option. If this group of celestial beings can leave and you remain, then they can live. But you, my dear, will have to become my guest here in Xi Liu’s abode. Regardless, one side must stay to enjoy the snow with me.” 

Xi Liu shot a glance at the Autumn Water Daoist, who immediately stepped aside.

The old woman chuckled, “My master always keeps his word; you should think it over.”

In the southern region, Xi Liu, this major demon, indeed meant what he said.

Thus, the Qi practitioners began to communicate silently, and almost simultaneously made their decision to retreat south.

In the end, only the young martial woman remained.

Xi Liu smiled and said, “You threw a punch for those ungrateful and vile characters, creating a path for yourself, yet ended up in a predicament. Don’t you think that’s a bit unworthy?”

Pei Qian walked over to the bamboo box, shaking her head. “A punch for oneself.”

Placing her walking stick atop the bamboo box, she slowly rolled up her sleeves. It seemed there was a fight about to unfold.

Perfect.

This was what she had been craving.

But Xi Liu continued with a curious inquiry, “Putting aside your previous encounters while heading south, which were clearly justified, is it right for you to deal with demons for these Qi practitioners today?”

Pei Qian still shook her head, replying, “I didn’t kill it. Whether you believe it or not is up to you, Senior Xi Liu.”

Since the other party was willing to be reasonable, even if it was only temporary, Pei Qian was willing to say a few more words.

Xi Liu was taken aback, turning to the old woman, whose expression was slightly awkward. “Reporting to the master, this young girl simply scared off that flower demon with a single punch.”

The flower demon that had previously chased the Qi practitioners was named Zhuo Hua. It had merely been injured by the young martial artist’s punch, but was terrified and mistakenly believed she was a disciple of Liu Suoyu, a Nine Realm martial artist, and had already fled hundreds of miles away.

And the major demon, Xi Liu, had been drawn here by the intent of Pei Qian’s punch, which was why he had mistakenly assumed Zhuo Hua had been killed somewhere.

Xi Liu’s curiosity grew. “Which sect do you belong to, little girl? Your style doesn’t resemble that of the Lei Gong Temple’s Pei Ah Xiang lineage at all.”

As for the respectful title of “Senior Xi Liu,” it made this jade purity realm demon on the snow-white lion feel rather amused and taken aback.

Pei Qian hesitated but shook her head.

Xi Liu seemed to ponder, then pressed his hand against his forehead, groaning in discomfort. 

What on earth was happening today? First, there was a young girl who was quite reasonable yet had an unreasonable martial cultivation, and now another woman was making him uneasy.

The latter was undoubtedly a sword immortal.

Sword immortals from the Northern Julu Continent were rare.

Adding to the fact that this one was a woman, Xi Liu concluded her identity: a sword immortal named Xie Songhua, who didn’t particularly enjoy her hometown, Aiai Continent.

It was said that Xie Songhua’s strikes were devastating and decisive, ending battles with a single blow.

Though Xi Liu felt apprehensive, he wasn’t overly fearful. Being in the southern icy plains, he had the advantage of terrain. If it came to a fight, he wouldn’t stand a chance, but he could at least witness the sword immortal’s elegance before leaving.

The woman with the bamboo box approached, riding a sword and gliding in, her sword qi parting the snow and wind around her, creating a clear path, while the surrounding storm still obscured the sky.

She hovered in midair, her expression cold, looking down at Xi Liu, who preferred to hide.

Xie Songhua had left her two direct disciples behind in the city of Tuo Ling, named Zhao Mu and Ju Xing.

She had sensed something unusual in the area, which was why she had taken to the skies.

Besides Xie Songhua, who was recruiting disciples in a foreign land, there was also Li Cai from the Floating Sword Lake in the Northern Julu Continent, who had taken two sword-seeking disciples, Chen Li and Gao Youqing, away from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As for the sword immortal from the Golden Armor Continent, Song Ping, she too had taken two young girls as her direct disciples, named Sun Zao and Jin Luan.

Meanwhile, Pu He from the Liuxia Continent had descended to the Golden Core stage after encountering difficulties at the Sword Qi Great Wall and had taken a pair of teenagers with him, named Ye Du and Xue Zhou.

After returning to the Haoran World, Xie Songhua had exchanged messages with Li Cai, Song Ping, and Pu He through flying swords, each making an appointment for a reunion sixty years later.

Of course, this wasn’t a competition to see whose sword techniques were superior; it held little meaning. Especially for Li Cai and Pu He, who had suffered severe injuries that affected their fundamental sword path, and even the highly accomplished Xie Songhua didn’t feel her skills worthy of boasting compared to the great sword immortals. Moreover, could those of them who were still alive and returned to their homeland compare with those like Xie Zhi and Yuan Qingshu, who had died in battle? They couldn’t.

Given this, the four sword immortals compared their abilities to teach their direct disciples sword techniques, agreeing to meet in the Northern Julu Continent, where Li Cai resided, sixty years later.

Xie Songhua noticed the young woman standing by with the bamboo box and walking stick.

She hesitated to speak.

Back at the Sword Qi Great Wall, she had heard that the young Hidden Official’s disciples often had this kind of demeanor. However, the girl before her was certainly not Guo Zhujiu from the Sword Qi Great Wall. There was also a young girl with the surname Pei, who back then was quite small; even after all these years, she didn’t quite match the young woman in the snow.

What were the chances of encountering someone related to the young Hidden Official in this desolate northern icy plain?

Then, the young woman lifted her head, gathering her voice into a thread, and spoke in the dialect of the Sword Qi Great Wall, “Are you Xie Sword Immortal?”

Xie Songhua immediately descended on her sword, her long blade sheathing itself back into the bamboo box. She smiled and asked, “Is it really you? What was your name again, Pei...?”

“Pei Qian!” the young woman replied, clasping her hands together, her smile radiant.

Xie Songhua’s expression softened considerably as she carefully examined Pei Qian. “Very good, as expected of our Hidden Official’s foremost disciple. Excellent, excellent.”

Xie Songhua nodded towards Xi Liu. “So, have you been bullied? No worries, once I take a shot, we can head to Tuo Ling City together.”

Pei Qian scratched her head. “I was just following my master’s example, discussing reason with Senior Xi Liu.”

Xi Liu looked a bit helpless, nodding. “That’s indeed the case.”

Xie Songhua said, “In that case, I’ll just avoid the southern region and won’t trouble you.”

Then, Xie Songhua left Xi Liu behind, helping Pei Qian retrieve her walking stick and bamboo box. Pei Qian took back the walking stick and slung the book box over her back.

Xie Songhua spoke through her mind, “Have you heard the huge news? It’s somewhat related to your master, and it just spread not long ago.”

Pei Qian’s eyes widened. “What news?!”

Xi Liu watched the figures of the large and small disappear into the distance, shaking his head. What kind of situation was this?

Xie Songhua said, “I don’t know who first proposed it, but they’ve selected ten young talents from across the world.”

Pei Qian’s spirits lifted. “Where did my master rank?”

Xie Songhua shook her head, suppressing a laugh. “It explicitly stated that the ten don’t have a ranking order. Among them are the sword cultivator Ning Yao from Flying Ascension City, the martial artist Cao Ci from the Da Duan Dynasty of the Central Land, the Daoist Shan Qing from Bai Yu Jing, and the first of the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain, Fei Ran. Your master isn’t among the ten.”

Pei Qian was puzzled. How was this related to her master?

Xie Songhua rubbed Pei Qian’s head, saying, “They clearly stated ten young talents, yet there’s no ranking, which is quite odd. They listed eleven individuals and placed ‘Hidden Official’ at the eleventh position. Your master is the only one not named directly, only described as a mountain peak realm martial artist and sword cultivator. So now, the cultivators in the Haoran world are all speculating about who this Hidden Official is. Those of us who know your master’s identity aren’t too eager to indulge in this speculation; we’ll let them guess.”

Pei Qian shook the bamboo box, gripping her walking stick tightly, and looked around at the swirling snow. She shouted, “It’s my master!”

(End of chapter)

 **Chapter 823: Another Year’s Dragon Boat Festival**

Xie Songhua did not hurry to return to Tuo Ling City on her flying sword; instead, she chose to walk south alongside Pei Qian. 

In a small border town, no matter how many hidden talents there might be, one must still consider the swift blades of a female sword immortal. Her two direct disciples, although not yet at the peak of the Mid-Fifth Realm, were still sword cultivators, budding sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Even if something unexpected happened, Xie Songhua's flying sword would arrive in an instant. 

Moreover, prior to entering Tuo Ling City, Xie Songhua had taken Zhao Mu and Ju Xing to explore the northern peak of the Northern Yue Mountain in the Rain Worker Kingdom. There, the Northern Yue King would surely take care of the two children. If any mishap were to befall a direct disciple of a sword immortal within his domain—especially one belonging to Xie Songhua, who might delay their path to enlightenment—it would surely weigh heavily on a mere mountain king, potentially dragging the entire Rain Worker Kingdom into Xie Sword Immortal's memory.

Xie Songhua's temperament was well-known to be quite fierce across the Aiai Continent.

After chatting with Pei Qian, Xie Songhua felt a wave of emotion wash over her. She hadn’t anticipated that even she couldn't discern Pei Qian's depth of martial prowess. 

It turned out that this girl, barely over twenty, was already a pure martial artist in the far-travel realm. Such a rare talent, one that, if placed atop a mountain, would be considered a Yuanying sword cultivator in her twenties. If it weren't for Cao Ci’s past and Chen Ping’an’s present, Xie Songhua might have doubted Pei Qian's identity.

Yet, Xie Songhua felt more comforted than anything else. 

In truth, she had never met Pei Qian before, and they were not related, but seeing Pei Qian traveling with her cane and bundle gave Xie Songhua a sense of familiarity. Whether it was merely affection for someone associated with her or not didn't matter; if Xie Songhua found someone pleasing to the eye, the heavens had no say in it. If she found someone displeasing, they could certainly try to manage her flying sword, but they had better have the courage and capability to do so.

Thus, Xie Songhua chuckled, “If you’re worried that Auntie Xie’s swordsmanship isn’t up to par and that I won’t fare well against Xi Liu, then there’s no need for that roundabout way of speaking. Just tell me honestly, and I’ll go chop Xi Liu down right now. It’ll only take me about the time it takes to burn half a stick of incense to return. Killing a jade purity realm sword cultivator from the demon race isn’t that hard; without the title of sword cultivator, it becomes much easier.”

Pei Qian quickly shook her head, “Auntie Xie, it’s not like that. If Xi Liu were truly pushing hard and using her authority to pressure others, I would’ve asked for a duel right there.”

Xie Songhua nodded, “Then it seems Xi Liu has been lucky and has had her incense burned high. I initially planned to take Zhao Mu and Ju Xing to temper their sword intent in the southern ice plains, and I would definitely have a chat with Xi Liu. Zhao Mu has two life-bound flying swords, one named ‘Rainbow’ and the other ‘Pouring Rain’; it’s quite suitable for nurturing here. Ju Xing’s sword, ‘Thunder Marsh’, doesn’t benefit much from the ice plains. So, we’ll need to visit the Temple of Thunder to consult with Pei Axiang and see if Ju Xing has any opportunities for enlightenment over in the Ma Lake Prefecture.”

At the moment, Pei Qian didn’t quite understand what Xie Songhua meant by “having a chat with Xi Liu” or “visiting the Temple of Thunder.”

However, the fact that Xie Songhua was willing to reveal the true names of her two direct disciples’ flying swords indicated her closeness to Pei Qian, treating her as family.

Xie Songhua had always held a poor opinion of her hometown, Aiai Continent. After ascending to the Earth Immortal realm years ago, she had traveled extensively through the Liuxia and Jinjia Continents. Before taking on her direct disciples, every time she returned home, she would not disclose her whereabouts, nor would she flaunt her identity as a sword immortal. This led to quite a few conflicts, and not small ones at that. Xie Songhua never considered herself a reasonable person, so every time she would fight the young and the old alike. If the founding ancestor were still alive, that would be even better. Thus, the cultivators of Aiai Continent both feared and were troubled by this sword immortal from their own land.

Now, Xie Songhua’s prestige in Aiai Continent was at its peak.

As a female sword immortal, she had traveled the Sword Qi Great Wall, achieving remarkable military exploits, including slaying formidable demon beasts at the jade purity realm. Moreover, crucially, Xie Songhua had returned alive to the Haoran world.

For the cultivators atop Aiai Continent, a dead female sword immortal would just be that—a dead sword immortal. Aiai Continent had no custom of memorializing swordsmen like those at the Great Zhou.

The most shocking news for the people of Aiai Continent was the rumor that Xie Songhua was highly likely to break through the jade purity bottleneck and ascend to the immortal realm within a few decades, becoming the first great sword immortal from Aiai Continent to reach that level in a millennium.

For cultivators, a few decades could be as brief as a nap for an immortal atop a mountain.

Xie Songhua laughed and asked, “Now that we’re all martial artists of the Eighth Realm, why not fly on the winds for our travels?”

Pei Qian blushed a little and replied softly, “My master said that traveling downhill can set you back two realms. You mustn’t imitate someone who lets a move go free during duels.”

Pei Qian continued, “Auntie Xie, you can fly your sword, and I’ll ride the wind; there’s no need to be so particular since I’m following you.”

After all, Xie Songhua was a senior sword immortal, and this journey to the ice plains was to impart the swordsmanship teachings to her two direct disciples.

Xie Songhua burst out laughing, “As expected of his first disciple! No worries, we’ll continue walking to Tuo Ling City. Consider it a leisurely stroll.”

Curiously, Xie Songhua asked, “Who is this person? Can you tell me?”

Anyone that the young hidden official would mention wouldn't be simple. 

For instance, that wine-loving sword immortal, who was now the head of the Taihui Sword Sect in Beiju Lu Continent.

Pei Qian smiled, “Auntie Xie, there’s nothing I can’t tell you. My master’s friend is a military cultivator from the Ghostly Axe Palace in Beiju Lu Continent, named Du Yu. He enjoys roaming the world, and my master met him by chance during his travels in Beiju Lu Continent and learned some talisman techniques from him.”

Xie Songhua nodded, “Although I haven’t heard of the Ghostly Axe Palace, someone who can engage your master must possess quite the ability. However, in a duel, you certainly shouldn’t let your master take a hit.”

Pei Qian scratched her head. 

She was no longer that little charcoal girl from years ago, and she wasn’t even really a girl anymore, but this action still revealed a rare bit of innocence from her.

On the southern ice plains, Xi Liu was returning to her residence with the old woman and Daoist Qiu Shui, leisurely strolling through the blinding snow and wind.

The old woman softly asked, “Master, was that really the sword immortal Xie Songhua?”

Xi Liu smiled and nodded, “The sword intent contained within that bamboo box she carries is unmistakable.”

Daoist Qiu Shui, draped in a crane cloak and holding a plum branch, no longer possessed the demeanor of an immortal; he grinned, “That little girl has a heavy punch. I still ache all over from that one hit. When she landed that punch, my Qi Palace and the three souls and seven spirits felt like they were flipped upside down by a raging bull. That talisman that can shrink mountains and rivers? To have a pure martial artist use it in close combat is truly deadly. No wonder the founder of that lineage has been scolded for thousands of years.”

Xi Liu remarked, “Looking back, that little girl must have been deliberately hiding her strength. Perhaps when she punched at you, it was to conceal her true abilities. After I revealed myself, she likely considered me her only opponent. I suspect even that talisman was just a diversion. I guess if that little girl were to fully unleash herself, she would be faster than using a talisman. In that case, I should thank the sword immortal for not letting me lose my troops, and also thank that little girl for averting a disaster.”

Xi Liu couldn't help but feel, “Isn’t the natural order clear? Karma is indeed real?”

The old woman, puzzled, asked, “Master, your aura has been subdued and is without flaw, no less than that of a scholar from the academy. Even I can’t perceive a trace of it. How could that little girl have noticed?”

Xi Liu sighed, “You ask me? Who do I ask?”

Tuo Ling City served as the prefectural capital of the Rain Worker Kingdom's Lin Tan Prefecture and was one of the two important crossings leading to the southern ice plains.

At the city gate, Pei Qian presented a travel document. During her travels in Beiju Lu Continent, she had collected many stamped passes, and Senior Li Er from Lion Peak had helped her forge a new travel document, one specifically for mountain cultivators, which was also an important item for the wealthy and collectors down below.

Naturally, Xie Songhua did not have any travel documents, and upon glancing at Pei Qian, the guards at Tuo Ling City turned a blind eye and let them pass.

At the celestial inn, Pei Qian met the two budding sword immortals, both children of about ten years old, one boy and one girl. The girl was named Zhao Mu, while the boy was named Ju Xing; both appeared quite clever.

However, Ju Xing seemed slightly more serious, his eyes calm and subdued, which was not quite fitting for his age.

As was customary, Pei Qian presented them with two specially made bookmarks from the Fallen Star Mountain as a token of their first meeting.

Upon hearing that Sister Pei Qian was the first disciple of the hidden official, Ju Xing suddenly brightened up, while Zhao Mu also beamed with joy, as the little girl shared the same street as Guo Zhujiu, who liked to refer to herself as “the temporary disciple of my master.” Besides, there were innumerable stories about that hidden official.

Whether it was conning people out of their money selling wine or getting ripped off in gambling, the tales of extraordinary supernatural beings and scenic stories filled her mind, and she believed that Ning Yao and he were a match made in heaven. For her, he had traveled thousands of miles twice just for her, passing through three barriers, even defeating Qi Shou and Pang Yuanji in combat, willingly replacing Ning Yao to face the Li Zhen on Tuo Mountain, becoming famous in a single battle, and becoming the youngest and first outsider to be the hidden official in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall. Even Yu Juanfu had taken a hit from him, ultimately leading to three consecutive victories, with countless peculiar remarks that would make any great sword immortal’s heart ache. He personally wrote the “Ba Jian Immortal Seal,” maneuvering affairs at the summer palace, and on the battlefield, he was even more treacherous than the great demon Shou Chen, and he had even disguised himself as a woman while picking up scraps all over.

The little girl, who owned the two flying swords named “Rainbow” and “Pouring Rain,” pinched the bamboo leaf bookmark between her fingers, raised it high, and gently twisted it in the sunlight, clearly delighted with the gift.

After receiving the gift, she cautiously glanced at Ju Xing, and only when he accepted it did Zhao Mu dare to take her own.

After arriving in the Haoran world, her master had taken them through Jinjia, Liuxia, and Aiai Continents, passing by many celestial residences. Many kind elders would offer gifts to them, but Ju Xing always had a detached expression, his hands tucked into his sleeves. Her master didn’t mind, so she had also refused gifts. Once, she privately asked Ju Xing why, and the usually reticent boy suddenly became furious, asking if she still had any shame left. Zhao Mu was left scared and crying, and seeing her cry only made Ju Xing angrier. He dropped the threat that she should never speak to him again, or he would hit her.

Eventually, it was her master who came to comfort her, and only then did Zhao Mu feel a little better. In truth, during their travels through Aiai Continent, Ju Xing really had not spoken a word to her. Zhao Mu wanted to talk to Ju Xing but was too afraid. She tried to initiate conversation several times, hoping to get closer, but Ju Xing always acted like he was deaf.

So today, Ju Xing accepting a gift was a rare event.

Ju Xing had gently tucked the vibrant green bookmark, engraved with beautiful characters, into his sleeve to treasure carefully. In this Haoran world, reading had become the most ordinary thing.

Xie Songhua joked, “Having one who acts deaf and mute and another who cries at the slightest provocation is really difficult. Pei Qian, to be honest, your master is really something; it’s more challenging than being a hidden official.”

Xie Songhua gave a thumbs-up.

Pei Qian felt somewhat embarrassed.

Her master had indeed had a tough time taking her on journeys during those years.

While Xie Songhua complained, deep down, she felt more pride. She truly didn’t believe that the likes of Li Cai’s Chen Li, Gao Youqing, Pu He’s Ye Du, Xue Zhou, and Song Ping’s Sun Zao, Jin Luan, and all the other scattered children across the Haoran world could outshine her two disciples. It was absolutely impossible! She only accepted these two disciples, pouring her heart into them, and sixty years later, they would surely surpass the early little hidden official Chen Li.

Even if they didn’t, so what? Zhao Mu and Ju Xing would still be her beloved disciples.

Ju Xing sat on the railing with his arms crossed, gently swinging his legs. Back in his hometown, he had liked sitting like this atop the city walls; it was a habit he would never change in this lifetime.

Zhao Mu softly retorted, “Master, it was just three times, not ‘at the slightest provocation’.”

Ju Xing scoffed.

Immediately, Zhao Mu looked sickly.

Xie Songhua stood up and said, “Pei Qian, you chat with them; I’ll go find someone to discuss a few matters. I had an appointment to meet her here, and she should be arriving soon.”

Pei Qian accompanied the two children in casual conversation. 

Zhao Mu was like a chirping little sparrow, and when Pei Qian inquired about the recent excitement with the young ten, the little girl elaborately shared all the happenings.

Ju Xing, of course, had to defend the hidden official, insisting that apart from Ning Yao, at most Cao Ci could be added, but the other eight had no right to push the hidden official out of the top ten, only managing to grab the “eleventh” spot.

Pei Qian curiously asked, “What’s the story with the Ascension City?”

Zhao Mu laughed, “The fifth realm of the world, named Jia Chun, is based on our hometown, which was named Ascension City at the time of the world’s creation.”

Ju Xing added, “There’s news that Sister Ning Yao is not only the first jade purity realm sword cultivator of that realm, but she has also ascended to the immortal realm now.”

Pei Qian looked at this lively little girl and couldn’t help but miss the little millet from Fallen Star Mountain and the ever-youthful Sister Nuan Shu. 

At this moment, Pei Qian finally realized that Sister Bao Ping had grown up, and so had she. 

If her master, Bao Ping’s little uncle, found out about this, would he feel happy or sad?

Pei Qian opened her book box and began copying texts. 

Zhao Mu sat quietly beside her, resting her chin in her hands, watching Sister Pei write.

Ju Xing was lost in thought about the second opening of the fifth realm; soon, he would be able to return home. 

He heard that the fifth realm would open its doors for thirty years, after which it would be permanently closed. 

After that, if he wished to travel between the two worlds, he would have to become a great cultivator at the Ascension Realm.

Ju Xing felt a twinge of envy for Sister Pei’s walking stick and bamboo box. The little boy imitated the hidden official, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, dazedly sitting on the railing.

The young ten selected this time were all under fifty, and there was no distinction among them. 

The reasoning was simple; being too young, one needed at least a hundred years of mountain climbing and cultivation to truly attain enlightenment.

The Ascension City’s Ning Yao had broken through two realms in the fifth realm and ascended to the immortal realm. 

Great martial artist Cao Ci had reached the tenth realm while in the waters of Fu Yao Continent. 

Daoist Shansheng from Bai Yu Jing was at the jade purity realm, possessing no magical artifacts because all of his life-bound items were immortal weapons or semi-immortal weapons. He followed the path of the five elements and was regarded as the best in the world.

The first of the Hundred Sword Immortals of Tuo Mountain, Fei Ran, was a jade purity realm sword cultivator. It was said he enjoyed suppressing his realm.

There was also a direct disciple of a sub-saint, rumored to be a young scholar from the Qing Ming realm, who had been brought back to the Haoran world by the sub-saint in his early years. Not only had he received a gust of wind for flipping through books, but he had also formed the beginnings of a life-bound character.

A young monk who entered the fifth realm, wielding a twelve-ringed iron staff. 

From Qing Ming realm, a previously unknown female Daoist under twenty, who had only cultivated for eight years, stagnated for six years at the Liu Jin realm, then soared to the jade purity realm in one leap.

And in the Haoran realm, there was also Liu Cai, a formerly unremarkable wilderness cultivator, currently at the golden core realm sword cultivator, though his flying sword's killing power surpassed imagination. Even just reading about him in the reports would leave cultivators speechless. Since Ning Yao, Cao Ci, and Shansheng were truly the pride of heaven, their realms were sufficiently high, yet Liu Cai was merely at the golden core realm. Generally, let alone golden core sword cultivators under fifty, even Yuanying sword cultivators wouldn’t be a match for him and were completely unqualified to be listed.

With Liu Cai’s emergence, two long-lost sword nurturing gourds were revealed: the “Heart’s Desire” and “Immediate.” Liu Cai possessed two life-bound flying swords. The “Heart’s Desire” nurtured the flying sword “Biluò,” known for its ability to break through myriad laws, while “Biluò” could break through myriad swords. The “Immediate” helped nurture Liu Cai’s second flying sword “Bai Ju,” whose subtleness and swiftness could ignore the flow of time.

Thus, in the Haoran realm, it was said that the only sword cultivator who could compete with Ning Yao was Liu Cai a hundred years from now.

The young disciple of the Heavenly Master Qizhen, who had traveled to the Central Plains, served as the keeper of the archives. It was rumored that within three years, he had read every text of Daoism.

From the Barbarian realm, a young cultivator named Shi Yue burst onto the scene like Liu Cai and the female Daoist.

Lastly, there was a young person who had gained some fame from another continent, notorious for the “Chen Ping Case.”

Earlier, it was said there were still ten substitutes, but they had yet to be announced.

Zhao Mu mustered her courage and turned to steal a glance at Ju Xing, who hadn’t acknowledged her in a long time.

In truth, he was younger than her, born in the same month and year, but Ju Xing was a few days later.

However, the little girl always felt that Ju Xing was much older than her.

Ju Xing noticed Zhao Mu’s gaze and immediately glared at her. Zhao Mu blinked innocently, as if to say, “I’m not even talking to you; how is this your concern?”

Ju Xing’s fingers came together and lightly gestured for the little girl to turn her head back.

Zhao Mu complied, resting her chin on the table, continuing to watch Sister Pei write.

The little girl wanted to ask this sister why she had to leave her hometown if she was already home. 

If she could stay in her hometown, she would surely never travel far.

Sister Pei was truly brave and could endure hardships all on her own.

Zhao Mu was unaware that this tall, slender, slightly dark-skinned Sister Pei, who made her feel safe, was actually once a little girl who cried out in pain after just a light squeeze on her shoulders and arms at the pharmacy in Longcheng, even more so than Zhao Mu would have. Back then, Pei Qian was actually slightly older than Zhao Mu. As for courage, Pei Qian had very little when she was young, perhaps even less than little millet. Even now, she still carried a plain yellow talisman.

Sister Pei was focused on her writing. 

Suddenly, Zhao Mu felt a rush of panic and quickly turned to look at Ju Xing.

Ju Xing looked back at Zhao Mu and raised a finger to his lips, shaking his head, signaling for her to stay silent.

Zhao Mu stood up quietly, realizing that Sister Pei was copying the text and somehow shedding tears.

Pei Qian was feeling sorrowful; the next time her master scolded her, it seemed he might not need to bend down anymore.

Then, even if the master and disciple finally reunited and traveled together again, perhaps her master would never again reach out to hold the little girl’s hand.

How had she grown up so quickly?

Once, her older brother, the big white goose, had told a joke, asking her, the elder sister, if she knew who in the world had the most worries.

Pei Qian naturally said it was her master, as he loved to think things through and take care of others.

The little brother had laughed and shook his head, giving a rather absurd answer.

He said it was a fellow named “Grown Up.”

In the capital city of Dali, the elder statesman Guan sat in a rattan chair under the eaves, even though the old man was bundled up thickly, he still felt cold. Holding a warming stove, he gazed at the green parasol tree in the courtyard.

The old man smiled, extending his thumb to lightly touch a tooth, sighing heavily.

His diligent direct descendant Guan Yiran had returned to the capital this time, officially resigning from the position of the overseer of the Qi Crossing project. He was about to fill a vacancy in the Ministry of Revenue but had not been promoted to a ministerial position like Liu Qingfeng. To be honest, even compared to the young Liu Xunmei, Guan Yiran’s promotion seemed rather meager and stingy in the emperor’s eyes. 

Although Guan Yiran, who hailed from the military background at the borders, was reluctant, it was not that he despised the lowly position, but rather he had long been accustomed to the rough life on the battlefield. Nonetheless, he obeyed the orders of his great-grandfather and chose to return to the capital to serve.

Upon returning home, Guan Yiran immediately rushed to the old man’s side.

Guan Yiran squatted down beside the old man, pressing his hand against the warming stove.

The old man chuckled, “The Ministry of Revenue is an ungrateful place; get used to it. The Ministry of Personnel is out of the question; don’t ever dream of working there in your lifetime. After all, others think the Ministry of Revenue belongs to the Guan family, but if you Guan family members truly believe that, it’s a path to death. You must leave some room for others. Squatting in the latrine without relieving yourself or staying too long will get you stoned, and then you can’t complain about anyone else.”

Guan Yiran smiled. The earliest batch of important ministers in the Dali court were actually rather uncouth, even those from scholarly backgrounds.

The old man looked up at the beautiful scenery of the sunset sky, sighing, “Teeth fall, hair falls, and I can’t walk anymore. How vexing. When I see a young, beautiful girl, I’m left with no heart or strength; at most, I can only reminisce about the past and think of the young heroes. Being young is good; there are promotions to be had. The flying deities in the sky are also enviable.”

The old man spoke to himself as the young man listened.

“The country is broken, but the mountains and rivers remain; the city is full of spring grass and deep woods. The person rolling up the curtain still says things remain the same. This is a collection of verses by a literary master from the Lu clan, beautifully written. It’s a pity that while his writing is good, his governance skills are quite lacking.”

“The fragrance of food when starving, and the scent of powder from young girls is delightful, but there’s another fragrance that’s not bad, you know? That’s when you scratch your feet on a summer’s cool mat.”

“Go, help great-grandpa steal a pot of wine. A few pots that were hidden in the study earlier have been secretly taken by your father and placed in his own study. What a rotten thing. After putting down the wine, let great-grandpa sit for a while by himself. Haha, a good one to drink and gorge, but don’t let the younger generation know.”

Guan Yiran hummed in agreement and stood up to leave.

Suddenly, the old man called out, “Yiran.”

Guan Yiran immediately turned around.

The old man smiled without saying a word.

Guan Yiran understood, saying, “Got it, I’ll take two pots.”

The old man nodded, “When you’re an official, be sure to do a good job, but don’t forget to be a good person first. Don’t imitate those big overseers, who rarely go out, but when they do, they’ll follow an official with a bigger hat, and first borrow a pair of badly worn boots. Don’t do anything foolish like that, or else great-grandpa will really lose sleep.”

Guan Yiran’s eyes turned slightly red, nodding vigorously, “Understood!”

After the young man left the courtyard.

Old Master Guan gently patted the arm of the rattan chair, softly calling, “National Teacher? Are you busy? If not, come and chat with me?”

The National Teacher of Dali, Cui Zhan, appeared.

Old Master Guan did not pay his respects, nor did he even greet him; he simply continued gazing at the darkening sky, murmuring, “Cui Zhen, will the world get better? I asked you this question when I was young, and you only said I should see for myself. Now that I’m getting older, my eyesight is failing, and I can’t see far even when I squint, and in the future, I won’t see anything at all. Cui Zhen, what do you think? So I can walk with peace of mind.”

Cui Zhen replied, “At least during Guan Yingche’s time in office, the Dali state was better.”

The old man softly said, “But there are still many grievances that make one uncomfortable. I don’t even know how to express them or to whom I should speak.”

Cui Zhen replied, “Every household’s meals and every family’s couplets are the answers to the grievances in the hearts of scholars.”

The old man nodded, “Once, a well-read young scholar said that the blooming and withering of flowers, the dying and flourishing of grass, are all responses to the moonlight above. Your words are spot on, Cui Zhen.”

Cui Zhen smiled, “Who would disagree?”

Dali once had a cold clan scholar preparing for the imperial examination, who, at a youthful age, boldly claimed, “Who else but me could be the literary master of the nation?” Yet in reality, his poetry and prose were quite mediocre.

The old man lamented, “It’s not that I fear death; it’s just that it’s hard to let go.”

That young man came from the Cliffside Academy.

The old man said, “Cui Zhen, I’m glad to have met you and Qi Zhen. During my time at the academy, learning from Qi Zhen, and serving in the court with you, Cui Zhen.”

Cui Zhen nodded, “I believe Qi Jingchun will also be glad to have a Guan Yingche among his students.”

The old man asked, “Then can I curse the national teacher a few times for Qi Zhen?”

Cui Zhen smiled, “You should first curse the Minister of Personnel, then you can curse me.”

The old man laughed, shaking his head, “Let’s skip that.”

Many conversations between old men were like final verdicts.

When Guan Yiran returned with two pots of wine, only the national teacher could drink.

In the sixth year of Jia Chun in the fifth realm, half of the Sword Qi Great Wall in the Barbarian realm had been isolated by formation, truly wandering alone year after year.

Ever since Fei Ran left, he had been walking on the cliffs, occasionally using his knife to break through formations for a moment, gazing at the vast demon army marching northward.

After six years, he still hadn’t seen the demons retreat southward.

In the end, he simply sat in a place that could barely be called a cave, occasionally drawing his knife to break seals, left with nothing to do but watch the demons continue northward.

Yet, every time Chen Ping’an drew his knife, the seals would quickly mend themselves.

Upon learning of this, Li Zhen suggested that Tuo Mountain be even crueler and set up a solid formation between the two cliffs that even a jade purity realm sword cultivator couldn’t break, denying that young hidden official any opportunity to savor it.

Unfortunately, the Jiazi account had put this plan on hold for now, saying it would be discussed later.

On this day, a young hidden official in a bright red robe sat cross-legged, a broad sword resting on his knee, gently tapping the sword sheath with his hand.

In one sleeve, there was a collection of densely written characters from that travelogue, packed tightly as if a great army was assembling.

In fact, when Chen Ping’an first finished reading the book, he realized the hidden secrets within.

That was why he had the thought, “It’s a good thing I didn’t write about what I truly care about; otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to speak properly in the future.”

Chen Ping’an was extremely sensitive to the “eleven,” and as for the “gain word,” he knew well that those many bamboo slips were not engraved for nothing. He had a greater fondness for collecting obscure and complex words and phrases than many others who had read since childhood. Especially regarding decoding, he had learned early on in the streets near the tavern, where the children had already experienced the prowess of this second shopkeeper.

Now, when drawing his knife to break seals, besides observing the number of demon troops and deducing the situation of the war, Chen Ping’an also needed to determine whether that great door would occasionally close, worrying that Tuo Mountain had already noticed the secrets of the travelogue and might close the door to isolate the two realms, or that they had already set up other mountain and water prohibitions. If Chen Ping’an were to act hastily, it would instead cause Cui Zhen’s secret plans to fall through.

Just knowing that the travelogue was extraordinary was meaningless. This was also what made Cui Zhen the most meticulous.

In these years, after inscribing all the words in the travelogue, Chen Ping’an had racked his brains to decipher that sealed letter, arranging those words in various formations, which was extremely laborious. He had reread the travelogue repeatedly, perhaps in a certain chapter, taking one character from every eleven characters, gathering them all to see if he could form a sealed letter, perhaps focusing on the characters “Lian” and “Chan,” expanding in various contexts, or using reverse chronology to search for clues...

Cui Dongshan had said that anyone whose mind was normal couldn’t unravel this thread of reasoning.

But in truth, his teacher had not only grasped the thread after reading the travelogue once, but even the act of throwing the book and retrieving it had been a distraction. Since then, he had been refining characters while pondering thousands of miles.

All the trivial matters in life that felt burdensome and uncomfortable might eventually shine brightly like scattered stars at some point on the road ahead.

Chen Ping’an curled up, his hands tucked into his sleeves, lost in thought.

Today in the Haoran world, it was the fifth day of the fifth month.

When there were people around, Chen Ping’an wouldn’t pay much attention to whether it was the fifth day of the fifth month. 

But when alone, he would think of it each time.

After his parents passed, one day at the end of Mud Bottle Alley, a family opened their door. Later, that family had a little snot-nosed kid, and he soon met his neighbors, Song Jixin and Zhi Gui, and later Liu Xianyang. 

Then he left his hometown, and with Li Bao Ping and Li Huai, and later Zhang Shan Feng and Liu Yuanxia, and also Pei Qian, he had Fallen Star Mountain. Even at Shujian Lake and upon reaching the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had people who mattered by his side.

Yet, in these past years, Chen Ping’an had once again been alone.

He gently exhaled, tapping his chest lightly, thinking that being alone still allowed for some self-talk.

On the high cliffs across from him, Li Zhen and Liu Bai had come to the Dragon King’s side together today.

Li Zhen smiled and asked, “Why is our hidden official so quiet lately? Has he taken to heart that old saying in the Haoran world, ‘The dog that bites doesn’t bark’?”

The Dragon King glanced at him, disinterested in responding.

You’re the one who likes to make noise.

Liu Bai smiled slightly, clearly understanding the Dragon King’s expression.

Li Zhen shouted, “Hidden official! If the travelogue doesn’t say otherwise, today is a good day!”

Chen Ping’an lifted his head, and the next moment, he appeared atop the city walls.

Li Zhen grinned, “I have two pieces of good news for you. One is that the ‘Hidden Official’ is quite famous in several realms now. The second piece of good news is that the Jiazi account is increasingly valuing our hidden official; they’re going to shut the door for good.”

Li Zhen waved, “Next time we meet, please don’t come with a tail begging, alright?”

The Dragon King shot Li Zhen a sideways glance and said, “Just a reminder.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “I’ll be at jade purity soon.”

 ### Chapter 824: The Hidden Beauty

On the land of Tongye Continent, amidst the countless celestial mounds, there were only a few mountain sects that could rely on the formations of mountains and rivers to resist the invasion of the demon clan. 

The formation known as the Three Enclosures and Four Symbols, created collaboratively by the Yuguizong, Tongye Sect, Taiping Mountain, and Fuji Sect, was growing increasingly dim. If one were to look down from the heavens upon the continent, the flickering lights of human settlements appeared to gradually extinguish. Each time a light vanished, it heralded the fall of a celestial sect, marking the erosion of Tongye Continent’s fortune, which was instead being absorbed by the demon race. As this cycle continued, the mountain dwellers found themselves trembling with fear, realizing the outcome was already set.

To the south lay the Xuanju Sect, predominantly composed of female cultivators, with their ancestral mountain, Konghou Mountain, housing a hall of ancestral masters known as the Thunderous Hall.

Although it was not a particularly large sect, its remote geographical location made it somewhat inconsequential, allowing it to temporarily evade the onslaught of the demon army.

Currently, the Xuanju Sect had gathered dozens of displaced cultivators from various mountain sects. Once high and mighty celestial masters, they now all felt like stray dogs without a home.

Among them was a young swordsman in a green robe, hailing from a small sect. Previously, he held a jade token from the ancestral hall of his sect and paid a sum of celestial money to seek refuge in the Xuanju Sect.

Today, he ventured alone to a picturesque location within Konghou Mountain, known as the Xiuzhu Rock Water Viewing Platform. Below the Xiuzhu Rock was a deep pool, its depths unfathomable. As the green-robed swordsman ascended the platform, he used a horn of a thousand-year-old lamp to illuminate the depths, observing the aquatic creatures and ethereal beings that inhabited the dark waters. With the aid of celestial spells, the mundane eye could perceive many bizarre and unusual aquatic beings, which, after being tamed by the Xuanju Sect’s celestial masters over centuries, swam leisurely about, remarkably docile.

Sitting on the water-viewing platform, the green-robed swordsman held several pieces of intelligence acquired recently. Among them was the report on the thirty military camps, including the Jia Shen Camp, which had already occupied various ancestral halls of celestial sects or the capitals of worldly dynasties. They had effectively encircled the three major academies, including the Dafu Academy, and the four major sects, including Yuguizong, completely sealing off any escape routes. The chaotic world was continuously devouring, seizing, and transforming the fortune of Tongye Continent, while the pressure from the demon army, upon landing, grew increasingly oppressive.

If it weren’t for that Zhong Kui, who continually restrained the great demon Bai Ying—making it exceedingly difficult for Bai Ying’s skeletal armies to form an effective offensive—every encounter with Zhong Kui would result in their self-collapse. His astonishing innate divine arts often caused numerous remnants of ghostly entities found on battlefields below to vanish in an instant, as if they had died a second time, creating significant troubles for the front lines of the chaotic world. Otherwise, the Dafu Academy and several sects, including the Fuji Sect, would have certainly fallen by now.

Following the suggestions of Shoucheng and the Jia Shen Camp, the various military camps began actively recruiting cultivators from Tongye Continent while also imposing restrictions on their advancing troops, prohibiting any further indiscriminate slaughter of cities. They aimed to replicate the strategies employed by the Great Li Iron Cavalry in Baoping Continent, making suitable modifications to drive the armies of the lower kingdoms and vassal forces to attack the mountain sects.

In the eyes of the green-robed swordsman, the only flaw was that the military camps of the chaotic world were still not comparable to the civil and military officials of the Great Li Song family, lacking the kind of strict adherence to orders. 

To put it simply, while they excelled at killing, they were utterly inept at strategy. However, this was all expected. It wasn’t just the chaotic world; even many scholars in the Haoran world found themselves lost in a fog when it came to economic strategies. There was no need for excessive demands; once the Yuguizong or Taiping Mountain fell, the last remnants of morale and spirit among the people of Tongye Continent would be shattered.

As for the strategic choices regarding Yuguizong and Taiping Mountain, Feiran, the sword immortal Shoucheng, and several military camps—including Jia Shen Camp—suggested first breaking Taiping Mountain. As for Yuguizong, located at the southernmost point of Tongye Continent, what would it matter to delay for a few more years? There was no need to entangle with it too deeply. They should quickly gather their forces; as long as they could capture the Tongye Sect that was stationed nearby, they could then cross the continent and crush Baoping Continent. They absolutely must not give the Great Li Iron Cavalry any more opportunities for troop movements.

Yet, more military camps believed that capturing Yuguizong and completely seizing the fortune of the entire continent was the most secure choice. Moreover, with so many sword cultivators in the chaotic world, the earlier encounter at the Sword Qi Great Wall, where they were thwarted, provided a perfect opportunity to test their swords against Yuguizong. Breaking the ancestral hall of Yuguizong would serve as a fitting conclusion to this war on Tongye Continent.

The young swordsman, who had come to seek refuge in Xuanju Sect, was none other than Feiran, the late arrival to Tongye Continent and the junior brother of the great demon Qie Yun.

Thus, when Feiran saw the last piece of intelligence, he couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time. He had inexplicably found himself among the ranks of the ten young elites of the world, standing alongside the likes of Ning Yao, Cao Ci, and Shan Qing, which made Feiran feel quite uncomfortable. Especially the evaluation that labeled him as “adept at pressuring borders” filled him with resentment; he wished that the cultivators of other factions would remain oblivious to his existence for as long as possible.

Unsurprisingly, Shoucheng was already at the Yuzhi Peak, which was a rather tough nut to crack, being a major sect of Tongye Continent with a very resilient mountain protection formation. Shoucheng did not raise any alarms and deliberately redirected his military forces to attack other sects, secretly driving tens of thousands of displaced people towards Yuzhi Peak. In the ancestral hall of Yuzhi Peak, a compassionate female master, moved by pity, stood firm against the majority and ultimately chose to lift the restrictions of the mountain and water formations, allowing the refugees to take shelter at Yuzhi Peak.

Unlike Feiran’s leisurely exploration of the mountains, Shoucheng was heading straight for the ancestral hall of Yuzhi Peak.

Feiran looked up in the direction of Yuzhi Peak, where a beam of sword light shot up into the sky, alongside a familiar array of spell lights, showcasing the grand strokes of his senior brother Qie Yun.

From this moment on, Yuzhi Peak would become a tale of human affairs recorded in history, and after some time, it would simply be an old chapter forgotten.

A young boy rushed towards the Xiuzhu Rock Water Viewing Platform, awkwardly approaching Feiran and saying, “Brother Chen, everyone says the Xuanju Sect definitely won’t hold. What should we do? I feel bad for making you spend so much money. If we die, how can I repay you?”

The boy squatted down, grumbling, “I’m not worth that much money. That’s celestial money…”

The young man, now going by the name “Chen Yin,” smiled and said, “That celestial money is just like the coins in your pocket to me, so you don’t have to worry too much about it.”

Still concerned for “Brother Chen,” the boy whispered, “Celestials can’t just waste money like that…”

Feiran chuckled dismissively.

Not only had he changed his name, but he had also altered his appearance to resemble that of a young hidden official, purely out of boredom.

As for the boy, a simple woodsman from Tongye Continent, he had met Feiran during his travels. The boy had no family and had once rescued a mountain spirit on the verge of transforming into a human. To express gratitude, the spirit often brought hunted prey to the boy’s doorstep. Feiran had fortuitously witnessed this scene and decided to take the boy along to the Xuanju Sect’s Konghou Mountain, thousands of miles away.

Feiran brought the boy to observe the myriad of peculiar aquatic creatures.

As dusk approached, several beams of rainbow light suddenly broke through the mountain and water formations of the Xuanju Sect. Once glimpsing Feiran’s figure on the Xiuzhu Rock Water Viewing Platform, the lights changed course, bypassing the Thunderous Hall atop Konghou Mountain, landing instead beside Feiran, along with his senior brother Qie Yun and the swordsman candidate Yu Si.

Also present was a slender girl with a short knife at her waist, nicknamed Doukou. She was a naturally “unfocused” and fragile being, prone to attracting malevolent spirits, yet contrary to fate, she had cultivated a small world within herself, resembling a blessed land.

The girl’s eyes were vacant and hollow, but she still nodded at Feiran.

Qie Yun raised two fingers to twirl a strand of hair at his temple, squinting with a smile. “Junior brother, what’s the point of bringing along a little one with no aptitude for cultivation?”

Feiran smiled back, “I’m just bored.”

The girl turned her gaze toward the Thunderous Hall atop the mountain. Qie Yun said, “Little lady, I’m begging you, please don’t go on another rampage like you did at Yuzhi Peak. There are plenty of beautiful women around; can’t you just refrain from making a move?”

The girl rasped, “I’ll just take their heads and leave them for senior brother Qie Yun. As for the male cultivators, you don’t need to worry about them.”

Qie Yun clasped his hands together. “Alright, alright. Just remember to keep the women safe!”

The girl drew her short knife, lightly flicked her wrist, and the short knife suddenly transformed into a dazzlingly bright giant blade that resembled a horse-slaying sword. She soared into the air, heading toward the ancestral hall of the Xuanju Sect.

Yu Si turned to Feiran and said, “Senior brother Shoucheng is still at Yuzhi Peak cleaning up the aftermath. The next target is the Mirage City of the Great Spring Dynasty.”

Feiran nodded. “Do as you please.”

Qie Yun suddenly laughed. “Senior brother just received word that Mr. Zhou has already arrived at the gates of Dafu Academy. There’s a good show to watch now. Once I finish my makeup, I’ll rush over to cheer for Mr. Zhou. Junior brother, what do you say? Want to join me?”

Feiran shook his head. “I’ll pass.”

The woodsman boy wasn’t foolish. Although he couldn’t understand the conversations around him, he could guess their identities, leaving his mind in a whirl.

Feiran crouched down and smiled at the boy in the local dialect, “I’m sorry, but I’m from the demon clan. However, don’t be afraid; just continue treating me like your Brother Chen. Even if the sky falls and the earth cracks, it has nothing to do with you.”

Feiran loved to learn the local dialects of every place he visited, purely out of boredom.

The boy was sweating profusely and stammered, “Brother Chen, what’s going on?”

Feiran thought for a moment and replied, “It’s probably a group of bad guests arriving uninvited, breaking down the door and leaving the host without a meal.”

The boy’s gaze gradually hardened. “Brother Chen saved me. No matter who they are or if they’re demons, they’re my benefactors! I don’t care how others see Brother Chen!”

Feiran smiled and nodded, then suddenly slapped the boy, causing his spirit to flee in fright.

Qie Yun was somewhat surprised and blinked, asking, “Junior brother, you killed him? Such a sensible child.”

Feiran stood silently, offering no explanation.

If the boy had even the slightest hint of resentment, no matter how well-hidden, Feiran would have allowed him to live, even giving him a chance to ascend the mountain for cultivation.

Feiran looked up at the distance, asking, “Senior brother, what will happen to that female master from Yuzhi Peak who insisted on opening the door earlier?”

Qie Yun gently patted his cheek, smiling without speaking. “In the ancestral hall, she had the loudest voice during the discussions, yet when it came to fighting, she was the least active.”

Yu Si added, “Senior brother Shoucheng originally intended to spare her life, but upon witnessing her kneeling and begging in the ancestral hall, he found it bothersome and changed his mind.”

Feiran nodded. “I hope the old dragon city in Baoping Continent will do the same.”

In the palace of the Great Spring Dynasty, Mirage City.

A young empress with a furrowed brow, incredibly beautiful, sat there looking melancholic, her fingers playing with an exquisite copper incense stick, gently stirring the ashes within the stove to prolong the burning of the charcoal.

Next to her sat her contemporary sister, Yao Lingzhi, who was spirited and energetic. Seeing her sister’s downcast demeanor, she was unsure how to comfort her.

Their grandfather, the Minister of War Yao Zhen, had donned his armor once more and led the Yao family’s youths to the border.

Earlier today, a prince responsible for guarding the capital and temporarily presiding over state affairs visited, ostensibly to discuss military matters, but his eyes had never strayed from her sister’s face. Had it not been for Yao Lingzhi protecting her sister, even going so far as to press her hand against the hilt of her sword to signal to him not to overstep, who knew what that lecherous man would have done? In the current palace, there was truly no one her sister could trust.

When that prince took his leave, the smile he wore as he turned to cross the threshold sent chills down Yao Lingzhi’s spine.

Yao Jinzhi raised her head and forced a bitter smile. “I’m fine.”

Yao Lingzhi felt a surge of anger; if this was fine, then what would be considered a problem?

Right now, inside and outside the palace, the situation was a mess, from the court to the rivers and lakes, to the battlefield.

That bastard wearing the dragon robe had actually left her sister all alone. He had sneaked away, taking with him a large number of celestial-grade offerings, escaping to the fifth realm. 

What pained her sister the most was that the excuse the emperor gave for leaving her behind was absurd—someone from the Astronomical Observatory had predicted that her sister was a calamity in the making, and keeping her around would only bring disaster.

The young empress of the Great Spring Dynasty cradled the warming stove in her hands, her heart feeling hot yet cold.

She remembered that during her journey to Mirage City, she had secretly calculated her fortune.

It was fortunate for her, but the omen for the Great Spring Dynasty was not good, and she had been perplexed back then.

Now, looking back, it was clear that both good and bad fortunes existed. The good was that the Great Spring Dynasty’s fortune was indeed on the brink of collapse, while the bad was that her own fate seemed destined to follow suit.

If it weren’t for her grandfather still leading troops at the border and Yao Lingzhi acting as her personal bodyguard, Yao Jinzhi truly didn’t know how to cope. She dared not die, and when she glanced at the beams, she didn’t dare think of that white silk. Once, she had mustered the courage to take a long look at the well in the palace, and that had only frightened her further. After entering the palace, Yao Lingzhi had fallen and cried on the ground one day after a discussion, asking her little sister through tears if there was any painless way to die.

At that time, Yao Lingzhi had squatted beside her, holding her sister tightly, afraid to tell her that being in the hands of those demons would be worse than death.

At this moment, Yao Jinzhi suddenly said, “For the next few days, you must stay by my side, never leaving my side. Otherwise, I won’t be able to hold on. But when the demons begin to attack Mirage City, and it seems we can’t hold out any longer, you must kill me. Just remember to be quick when you strike.”

Yao Lingzhi’s face went pale, and she nodded gently.

The young empress suddenly smiled, gazing out at the heavy snowfall, and inexplicably thought of a person.

If only he were here, regardless of the outcome, she wouldn’t be so frightened.

Over these years, she had only occasionally thought of that man she couldn’t quite say she liked.

In the remote small country of Aihai in the Aihai Continent, there was a modest Leigong Temple, presided over by a young man named Pei Axiang.

Today, this handsome young master, after lighting three sticks of incense at the incense burner, stepped out of the temple to welcome guests.

Those aware of his identity were hesitant to disturb him, while those who dared were generally welcomed by Pei Axiang.

He wore a white robe with a jade belt, a green bamboo flute at his waist, adorned with a yellowing bead at its end.

The bamboo flute, crafted from rare materials, came from the Qing Shen Mountain, a celestial cave in the Bamboo Sea, while the bead was a commonplace item that most wealthy families wouldn’t even glance at.

Three guests arrived: Liu Youzhou, the direct descendant of the Liu family’s God of Wealth, Liu Mama, a family matron, and Liu Suoyu, Mama Liu’s daughter, who was one of Pei Axiang’s three direct disciples.

Liu Suoyu, dressed in a white fox fur coat and carrying a short black scabbard, had once achieved the rank of the strongest in the distant travel realm and was a frequent visitor to the northern ice plains. 

From a distance, Liu Youzhou shouted, “Axiang! Axiang!”

Pei Axiang smiled slightly, deciding not to hold a grudge against the little brat for spending too much money.

Mama Liu could only softly remind, “Young master, didn’t we agree beforehand that when we see Senior Pei, we shouldn’t call him ‘Axiang’?”

Liu Youzhou laughed heartily, “Can’t help it, can’t help it!”

Pei Axiang sat on the steps at the entrance.

Liu Youzhou plopped down beside him.

Seeing her master, Liu Suoyu smiled and said, “Master, you look particularly spirited today.”

Pei Axiang teased, “It’s hard not to be happy when a benefactor like you pays a visit.”

Mama Liu sighed in relief, glad that Master Pei was in a good mood around her young master.

Liu Youzhou pulled out an incense burner and presented it to Pei Axiang. 

Pei Axiang glanced at it, waved his hand, and sent the incense burner back into the Leigong Temple.

Liu Youzhou had just returned from the waters and caves of Fuyun Continent, traveling through the routes of Jinjia Continent, Liuxia Continent, and Aihai Continent. 

In the waters and caves of Fuyun Continent, Liu Youzhou had given away more than ten magical treasures to new acquaintances he had made not long ago, treating it as a loan.

He hoped they would return the favor.

It wasn’t that he was reluctant to part with those treasures, but he didn’t want those freshly acquainted faces to fade into memories.

Pei Axiang asked, “How is that Cao Ci doing? What level has he reached in the ten realms?”

Liu Youzhou shook his head. “I didn’t ask.”

Pei Axiang felt somewhat helpless.

Liu Suoyu, sitting beside them, lightly tapped her knees, saying, “Among the young elites, there’s a mountain peak cultivator named Yinguang, who is also a sword cultivator. Considering the previous surge in martial luck at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he’s most likely the young man Liu Youzhou is familiar with.”

Pei Axiang inquired with confusion, “What do you mean?”

He had truly not heard of this matter before.

Liu Youzhou pretended to tidy his collar.

Liu Suoyu immediately kicked him playfully.

At the Liu household in Aihai, a painting of Liu Youzhou’s hung in his study, poorly drawn like a child’s scribbles, depicting a flat boat on the sea with a boy carrying a sword standing at the bow. 

The so-called boy was merely a circle with several branches, a poor representation of a human.

Years ago, when Liu Suoyu had seen this “masterpiece,” she had asked about it, and Liu Youzhou had boasted that his water pattern painting technique had captured about seventy to eighty percent of Ma Yuan’s finesse in “Water Map.” 

Even as a youth, Liu Youzhou had feared that Aunt Liu wouldn’t believe him, so he had casually flipped through his desk until he finally pulled out a genuine copy of “Water Map,” hoping to have Aunt Liu authenticate it.

As a grandmaster martial artist, Liu Suoyu had no interest in the priceless painting, only asking about the boy.

Liu Youzhou had recounted the events at Guifei Island, where they had encountered a storm, and Liu Suoyu had remembered that odd boy who had climbed the upside-down mountain but didn’t visit the Yuanrou Mansion.

Now, after being playfully kicked by Aunt Liu, Liu Youzhou chuckled, “His name is Chen, and he’s from Baoping Continent—a generous person.”

Pei Axiang smiled, “The person you described as generous must be extraordinarily generous.”

Liu Youzhou responded, “If I casually give someone a grain of Gu Yu money, it’s like a stingy person giving a common person a grain of Gu Yu money; that’s how it should be calculated.”

Pei Axiang laughed. “The entire Yuanrou Mansion has been dismantled and sold; isn’t your father upset?”

Liu Youzhou shook his head. “My father only regrets that there’s only one Yuanrou Mansion on the upside-down mountain.”

Pei Axiang sighed, “Sometimes, I have to admit that you wealthy people truly deserve to be rich.”

Old Mama Liu quietly added, “The young master foresaw the future of Yuanrou Mansion long ago. The master is quite pleased with this, saying that just based on this insight, it’s worth a Yuanrou Mansion.”

Liu Youzhou sighed helplessly. “I didn’t think this was such a good thing; why is Aunt Liu saying this?”

Pei Axiang turned to Liu Suoyu. “You’re in the mountain peak realm, and Yinguang is also in the same realm. Do you think you can compete with him?”

Liu Suoyu replied, “I’ll give it a try.”

Between them, who reaches a breakthrough first could gain martial luck, thus determining a victor without needing to truly fight.

Pei Axiang looked off into the distance. “Are they all gathering together? Did you all agree on something?”

Liu Suoyu followed her master’s gaze. “It seems to be that sword immortal Xie Songhua. Besides the two newly accepted direct disciples, there’s also a young woman with him…”

Pei Axiang nodded. “Just a pure martial artist, younger than you. Thankfully, she doesn’t look like you; otherwise, it would be a cause for concern.”

Pei Axiang frowned, standing up and muttering to herself, “Is that the one from the distant travel realm? How could this be possible?!”

Liu Suoyu’s eyesight was slightly inferior, discovering the clues a bit later.

Xie Songhua was flying far away, taking care of his two disciples, but the young woman didn’t seem to need any help from him to ride the wind.

The group landed in the quiet square outside the Leigong Temple.

The female sword immortal addressed him straightforwardly. “Xie Songhua.”

Pei Axiang ignored her.

Only when Xie Songhua reached the realm of celestial beings could he intimidate people just by name.

Liu Suoyu suddenly stood up, her spirits high. Being a martial artist made her excited. The thought of sparring with a sword immortal thrilled her.

Xie Songhua glanced at the famed Liu Suoyu from Aihai Continent, smiling. “Before discussing serious matters, you all chat first.”

Pei Qian clasped his fists. “I’m Pei Qian, wishing to ask Senior Pei for guidance on martial arts.”

Pei Axiang found it amusing, waving his hand. “No time.”

Pei Qian scratched his head, put his hands down, and simply said, “Alright then.”

Since Senior Pei wasn’t willing to guide him, Pei Qian could only give up. 

In martial arts, seeking guidance was not a death wish.

Old Mama Liu couldn’t help but chuckle; this girl was quite interesting.

She glanced at her own young master.

The two sword candidates, Zhu Xing and Zhao Mu, exchanged glances, ready to assist Pei Qian by carrying the book box and bamboo staff.

Pei Axiang finally became interested. “Little girl, how many times have you reached the strongest rank in the distant travel realm?”

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment. “Only five times.”

Liu Youzhou’s jaw dropped. 

Only five times, and she had said “only”? How could there be such a girl in the world?

What was her name? Liu Youzhou wanted to know such a friend from the martial world! One could be picky about money but not about friends.

Liu Suoyu rubbed her forehead.

Pei Axiang’s expression turned serious.

Liu Suoyu curiously asked, “In which two realms did you encounter difficulties?”

Pei Qian shook her head, remaining silent.

Liu Suoyu smiled, “If you tell me, I’ll stay in the distant travel realm and promise to spar with you.”

Pei Qian thought for a moment. “Could you not stay in the distant travel realm?”

I’m asking you to spar, and you’re not even teaching me martial arts; why stay in the distant travel realm?

Liu Suoyu stepped down the stairs. “Alright, I won’t stay in the distant travel realm.”

Pei Qian nodded, handing her walking staff to Zhao Mu and then taking off her book box, which Zhu Xing immediately caught with both hands. 

Zhao Mu lightly waved his fist, lowering his voice to say, “Sister Pei, be careful.”

Pei Qian rubbed the little girl’s head, smiling, “Stay away from me later.”

Xie Songhua took his two disciples and soared into the sky.

Liu Youzhou squatted on the steps behind Pei Axiang, tilting his head to look at the girl. Quietly, he asked, “Axiang, if it comes to fighting between the eighth and ninth realms, how can she compete?”

Pei Axiang responded, “You should ask that girl.”

Liu Youzhou rolled his eyes. “I’ve met a beautiful girl and have always been too shy to speak.”

Old Mama Liu laughed heartily.

The girl was not particularly pretty.

Liu Suoyu tossed aside her fox fur coat and casually dropped it onto the steps behind her.

With one hand behind her back and the other outstretched, she smiled, “From the Leigong Temple in Aihai, I am martial artist Liu Suoyu.”

Pei Qian took a step forward, slightly sinking her posture, her fists clenched together, and solemnly said, “From the Fallen Mountain lineage, I am the mountain-opening disciple Pei Qian. I wish to spar with Senior Liu!”

#### The Abode of the Sword Immortals

At the Ancestral Hall of Zhengyang Mountain, aside from the two old masters heading to the old dragon city, the remaining elder sword immortals of the Tao family had gathered today for several matters that required their joint decisions.

In the sword-rich Northern Julu Continent, even an Infant Transformation sword cultivator, upon being addressed as a sword immortal, might feel somewhat uncomfortable; however, in Baoping Continent, this was not the case.

Every Golden Core sword cultivator was undeniably a sword immortal in their own right.

A woman of unremarkable appearance sat with her seat placed slightly behind, her wrist adorned with a red string, sitting upright, appearing a bit restrained.

She managed the mountain and water reports and the reflections of flowers and moons at Zhengyang Mountain, having always been a mere errand runner. Although she held a seniority, her lack of sword cultivation and frequent absences caused her to be far less respected than the elder sword immortals.

Especially in this Zhengyang Mountain Ancestral Hall, in the eyes of those elder sword immortals, she was merely a clever yet not particularly wise woman—essentially, an unremarkable woman.

Su Jia had once been a disciple she brought into the mountain but had later been transferred to another peak. In exchange, she received a magical treasure, while Su Jia was later accepted as a direct disciple of the ancestral hall. This trade proved to be unfavorable for her.

Otherwise, while the lower realms enjoyed favor through maternal connections, the upper realms also had many idlers who lived off their disciples, creating a similar situation.

Of course, in the end, Su Jia’s fate didn’t turn out well.

At the Temple of Wind and Snow, she lost to the current owner of the Wind and Thunder Garden, Huang He, her sword heart shattered, unable to retain even her identity as a sword cultivator.

However, the Zhengyang Mountain Ancestral Hall merely reclaimed her purple gold sword nurturing gourd, not expelling her from their records, simply revoking her status as a direct disciple.

The first matter was to discuss several candidates for direct disciples, selecting an auspicious date to formally record their names in the hall’s records.

Zhengyang Mountain was a designated candidate sect of the Great Li, so they were now preparing for the selection of a sub-sect, which would certainly be located within the old Zhu Ying Dynasty.

Over the years, Zhengyang Mountain had absorbed a considerable number of young sword cultivators from the old Zhu Ying Dynasty. Additionally, there was a rather impressive sword immortal candidate, who the Longquan Sword Sect had foolishly neglected. After several years of cultivation at the Shenshou Mountain, even Ruan Qiong was unwilling to accept him as a direct disciple. After arriving at Zhengyang Mountain, he experienced rapid breakthroughs and now hoped to become a partner to the celestial maiden Tong Zhen of Hanlu Peak.

This first matter was relatively trivial, with no significant disputes arising.

The second matter was to discuss the descent of the second batch of disciples from Zhengyang Mountain. The previous group had already been sent to the old dragon city under the guidance of two elder masters.

Zhengyang Mountain had maintained a good relationship with the vassal king Song Mu, thanks to Tao Zi’s travels in Liuzhu Cave, which had forged a significant bond with the youthful Song Jixin.

However, for this second batch, who would be responsible for guiding them and which disciples to send were crucial matters. If the weight was insufficient, it could easily irritate the Great Li Song family. But if it was too heavy, Zhengyang Mountain could easily suffer considerable losses.

Thus, it required careful consideration.

The Tao family elder evidently had a plan prepared, offering a set of procedures with little dissent.

Next, they discussed the Night Banquet of the Mountain Lord of Zhongyue, which was also a minor matter. The only concern was to gauge the Mountain Lord’s stance to prevent any unnecessary complications in the selection of the sub-sect. After all, the Mountain Lord’s affection for the old Zhu Ying Dynasty was well-known.

The fourth matter was a delightful opportunity.

They discussed a potential marriage alliance with the Xu family of Qingfeng City.

Zhengyang Mountain had a talented disciple in Tao Zi, while Xu’s family in Qingfeng City had the son of the city lord. The two had traveled together in Liuzhu Cave and maintained a good relationship over the years. Their elders believed this was a match made in heaven.

Earlier, when Qingfeng City’s Xu family had experienced a series of unfortunate marriages, they had even married their legitimate daughter to a commoner son to mend the rift between Qingfeng City and the Great Li Dynasty.

The woman with the red string on her wrist gently asked, “Does Tao girl agree to this?”

The Tao family elder’s brow knitted slightly, as some words were difficult to speak.

Tao girl was indeed reluctant, and the elder also hoped for some hints from the old dragon city’s residence to Zhengyang Mountain.

Yet the young prince, whether feigning ignorance or genuinely treating Tao Zi as a sister, seemed unaware.

The Tao family elder gave the woman a glance, and she understood, saying, “Since this matter is not urgent, why not let Tao girl go to the old dragon city to see her senior brothers and sisters?”

The mountain lord merely stroked his beard in silence, seemingly hearing a voice inside, before nodding. “That’s fine.”

After the mountain lord made this decision, his expression turned solemn as he added, “Regarding the sword duel with the Wind and Thunder Garden, today we must provide a clear statement!”

On the surface, Zhengyang Mountain had only two Infant Transformation sword cultivators: one was the mountain lord of Zhengyang Mountain, while the other was the Tao family elder.

There was also the oldest elder who had been in closed-door cultivation for years and was about to emerge. 

Additionally, there were three Golden Core sword cultivator ancestors.

Zhengyang Mountain had always lacked a sword immortal at the upper five realms.

This was why they had been overshadowed by the Wind and Thunder Garden’s Li Tuanjing for hundreds of years.

Now that Li Tuanjing was dead, arranging a duel with the newly appointed garden master Huang He had become a pressing matter. Huang He’s aptitude was simply too exceptional; Zhengyang Mountain could not afford to be careless and risk nurturing a tiger.

Huang He’s brilliance was glaringly evident; he had already reached the Infant Transformation realm, likely to become the second Li Tuanjing. Thus, this matter could not be delayed any longer.

Zhengyang Mountain needed to find a suitable candidate to challenge Huang He.

However, whether it was the mountain lord of the same realm or the elder who was about to emerge as an Infant Transformation sword cultivator, neither was appropriate; the latter was even a whole realm higher.

The issue was that among the direct disciples of Zhengyang Mountain, there was truly no one capable of sparring with Huang He. It was possible that even Liu Baqiao’s sword would suffice to make the Zhengyang sword cultivators drink from the same cup.

As for the vassals and guest elders, there was a suitable candidate in the old Zhu Ying dynasty, a talented sword cultivator, once hailed as one of the two pillars, who had gained considerable sword fortune from the Zhu Ying dynasty. However, sending him to duel Huang He would still seem improper.

Unless that person was willing to become a direct disciple of Zhengyang Mountain.

Even if that person were foolish enough to agree to this, it could create a rift between Zhengyang Mountain and the Wind and Thunder Garden.

Thus, selecting someone for the duel had become a shared concern for all the elder sword cultivators of Zhengyang Mountain.

In the end, they still could not reach a foolproof plan today.

The Tao family elder angrily remarked, “If it comes to that, I’ll just swallow my pride and challenge a junior!”

The mountain lord shook his head. “That’s not suitable. We need to win with convincing authority.”

This Tao family elder had more hope of advancing to the upper five realms than himself. If he were to challenge the Wind and Thunder Garden and win, that would be fine, but if he were to lose or suffer an unexpected incident, dying under Huang He’s sword would mean the end of the mountain lord’s career.

Of course, the mountain lord was well aware that the Tao family elder was merely putting on a show, as he understood the mountain lord’s position.

Moreover, his words were filled with wisdom; since the Tao family elder challenging a junior was seen as losing face and bullying the weak, the mountain lord would be equally inappropriate in challenging with the same reasoning.

The woman, seeing the atmosphere in the hall grow heavy, said, “Perhaps there’s a way to make that guest elder become a direct disciple of the ancestral hall.”

She was looking at an elder across from her, who leaned forward slightly, intrigued, and asked, “What do you mean? If he becomes our direct disciple, he can challenge Huang He and win?”

The woman shook her head. “It’s unlikely. Although Yuan Bai is also an Infant Transformation sword cultivator, he is still inferior to Huang He. Yuan Bai’s only reliance is his innate magical skill that excels in trading injuries for injuries with his flying sword.”

The elder tugged at the corner of his mouth. Was this woman looking for trouble?

The woman immediately added softly, “But there’s a chance to establish Huang He’s position as the second Li Tuanjing, such as his identity and… realm! However, if this were to happen, Zhengyang Mountain might lose this highly anticipated duel.”

As soon as this was said, half of the sword cultivators in the ancestral hall remained indifferent, as this group of elders had never cared for Zhengyang Mountain’s affairs, focusing solely on sword cultivation.

However, the other half, often holding important positions, began to exchange thoughts rapidly.

The elder across from her coldly smiled, “That Yuan Bai isn’t foolish. Once he becomes our direct disciple, he’ll have to duel Huang He, and perhaps he’ll be dead tomorrow, leaving no future.”

The woman hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.

The mountain lord frowned. “Speak your mind.”

Finally, the woman cautiously said, “The reason Yuan Bai is willing to become our guest elder is that he hopes to protect the old Zhu Ying-born sword cultivators. If we Zhengyang Mountain agree to grant him a direct disciple title every fifty years, ensuring that this disciple will certainly advance to the upper five realms, then let’s say the contract is void after five hundred years. This way, Yuan Bai will find it hard to refuse, and he might even be grateful to us.”

The elder across from her nodded, smiling. “Not only can we openly challenge Huang He from the Wind and Thunder Garden, but we can also protect the descendants of the old country. Yuan Bai should indeed be grateful to us, thanking us for giving him a chance to die with dignity and grandeur.”

An elder suddenly stood up, quietly leaving the ancestral hall.

Soon after, several elders followed suit, also taking their leave.

The mountain lord was not surprised and the Tao family elder was too lazy to glance back. This group of stubborn old folks, didn’t they enjoy practicing their swords? Why not use their skills instead? If only they could cultivate their swordsmanship for hundreds of years and still not have a chance to unsheathe their swords. 

Could Zhengyang Mountain really become the leading sect in Baoping Continent relying on these useless old folks?

The woman felt anxious.

Perhaps she would end up regretting her words.

The mountain lord gazed at her, an unusual smile gracing his features. “Let’s settle this. You go persuade Yuan Bai to become a direct disciple of the ancestral hall. Once that’s accomplished, we’ll immediately announce that Yuan Bai will challenge Huang He of the Wind and Thunder Garden.”

The woman nodded gently.

The mountain lord felt in good spirits, and his gaze turned favorably toward the woman.

Within Zhengyang Mountain, only he knew a secret: the purple gold sword nurturing gourd that Su Jia had been bestowed by the ancestral hall was something this woman had discovered. She was astute enough to have exchanged it for a seat in the ancestral hall. This secret was revealed to him by his late mentor, so he kept it in his heart, ensuring that it wouldn’t be leaked.

The mountain lord said, “The last matter to discuss is about Liu Xianyang.”

Upon mentioning this, the mountain lord glanced at the Tao family elder, harboring some resentment. Years ago, Tao girl had traveled to Liuzhu Cave with the mountain guardian, yet unexpectedly, they hadn’t managed to recover that sword scripture, nor had they resolved the matter. Even a country boy from a rural area hadn’t been dealt with properly, leaving behind such a significant hidden danger. 

Although at that time Li Tuanjing was still alive, and that Liu Xianyang’s innate porcelain had reportedly been handed down to the Wind and Thunder Garden, the mountain monkey had some reservations, considering Zhengyang Mountain’s interests.

Now thinking back, it made the mountain lord feel a headache; nothing churned his stomach more than the thought of “if only I had known!”

The Tao family elder turned to her, raising his chin, and nodded toward the woman before addressing the mountain lord. “According to her intelligence, Liu Xianyang is now a direct disciple of the Longquan Sword Sect. Due to the Liu family’s ancestors being the tomb guardians for the Chen family’s ancestral graves, they later studied with the Confucian Chen family in Nanpuzhou for ten years. What realm has Liu Xianyang reached now? Has there been any contact with the Wind and Thunder Garden?”

The woman stood up, pulling a piece of paper from her sleeve. The Tao family elder reached out to grab it, beginning to examine it.

The mountain lord remained indifferent, treating it as unimportant. 

The Tao family elder frowned. “These are all trivial matters? Since he could become Ruan Qiong’s disciple, what realm is he in? Is he a sword cultivator? What’s his innate magical skill? During his studies with the Confucian Chen family in Nanpuzhou, did he cultivate any connections? Do we not know anything?!”

The Tao family elder pushed the paper over to the mountain lord.

After he read it, the mountain lord said, “From the information, this Liu Xianyang was a loose-lipped show-off in his youth. When he returned home, did he not mention his studies?”

The woman shook her head. “His temperament has changed significantly. Although he enjoys wandering every day, when speaking with neighbors, he only recounts stories of his hometown and never mentions the Confucian Chen family. In fact, in the entire Huaihuang County, apart from a few people like Cao Duzhao, hardly anyone knows he has become a disciple of the Longquan Sword Sect. And at Shenshou Mountain, the Longquan Sword Sect has too few members; Ruan Qiong’s direct disciples are especially few and hard to gather information from, lest we offend Ruan Qiong. Ruan Qiong is a character who, although he’s the chief guardian of the Great Li, has a good relationship with the Wind and Thunder Temple. We should avoid provoking them prematurely.”

The Tao family elder laughed, “You’ve said a few insightful things.”

The mountain lord sighed. “If only there were a Wei Jin, Zhengyang Mountain wouldn’t have to worry about its future. I would even be willing to give Wei Jin the position of mountain lord.”

Wei Jin had challenged the Tianjun Xie Shi of North Julu Continent twice.

He was undoubtedly the first sword immortal in Baoping Continent.

The woman feigned ignorance.

The mountain lord asked, “Is Liu Xianyang’s innate porcelain still in the hands of the Wind and Thunder Garden?”

The woman nodded. “It should be correct.”

The mountain lord rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on. “Since it has come to this, it’s a fatal grudge, especially for these young folks who can’t suffer even the slightest grievance. If he were to challenge us as a direct disciple of the Longquan Sword Sect, how would Zhengyang Mountain deal with him? Should we kill him or let him live? No matter how we look at it, it’s a hassle. If he were to connect with the Wind and Thunder Garden, they could team up to target Zhengyang Mountain. Even if the issue isn’t significant, it’s still undesirable.”

The woman tentatively said, “I have an idea; do listen.”

The mountain lord smiled, “Speak. If it can resolve a potential problem, Zhengyang Mountain is always fair in rewards and punishments.”

When the mountain lord mentioned this, he glanced at an empty seat that was slightly ahead of where the woman was seated.

The woman understood and immediately smiled, but suddenly hesitated.

The mountain lord was more understanding and said, “Today’s discussion hasn’t brought forth any major issues. You all can go back to practice swordsmanship.”

Some elder sword cultivators stood up and left, leaving the ancestral hall half-empty.

Only then did the woman say, “A female cultivator from our Qionghu Peak, while traveling through the Fox Nation, developed feelings for a disciple of the Lu family from Qingfeng City who originates from Liuzhu Cave. Why don’t we take advantage of this opportunity and let them become a couple, uniting as a pair of celestial partners in the mountains? Then, we can negotiate with the Xu family of Qingfeng City, allowing that man to join Zhengyang Mountain. This person is originally from the Great Li’s Huaihuang County, born into the Lu family on Fulou Street, and bears a grudge against Liu Xianyang. Not only that, but he nearly killed Liu Xianyang in a narrow alley. During Tao girl’s visit to Liuzhu Cave, he was also chosen by the woman of the Xu family, who helped lead the way.”

The mountain lord nodded, having understood the gist, feeling a sense of unexpected delight. Could it be that this woman, who had always adhered to the rules and disliked being in the spotlight, could actually be of great use to Zhengyang Mountain?

The woman continued, “If we hold a grand wedding, we can release rumors to Huaihuang County. Liu Xianyang is sure to hear about it. It’s better to resolve a grudge than to let it fester. Even if Liu Xianyang makes a scene at the wedding and kills that Lu family disciple, it’s better than letting him harbor resentment in his heart. After a ruckus, it could actually be a good thing, and afterward, he would have no excuse to entangle with us Zhengyang Mountain.”

The elder across from her chuckled, “Such a woman’s benevolence.”

The woman did not refute him.

That elder said, “As long as Liu Xianyang dares to act at the wedding, I can ensure that the Lu family disciple dies just right. Moreover, we can let the bride-to-be from Qionghu Peak commit suicide afterward. Whether she truly dies or not is unimportant; it’s all up to us to decide. At worst, we can let her follow the path of Su Jia and live incognito. Zhengyang Mountain wouldn’t mistreat her. I don’t believe that a ruckus of this magnitude won’t make Ruan Qiong lose face while protecting Liu Xianyang.”

The woman softly replied, “Elder Yan is remarkably perceptive.”

That elder leaned back in his chair, “Good talk.”

The mountain lord said, “We still need to think of a reason that compels Liu Xianyang to come.”

The Tao family elder chuckled, “Simple. Let the city lord of Qingfeng City attend the wedding as well. He’s still wearing that scarlet armor that belonged to Liu Xianyang’s ancestors. I believe Qingfeng City would prefer Liu Xianyang to perish sooner rather than later.”

The woman let out a breath, seeming somewhat fatigued after discussing so much.

At Zhengyang Mountain, on a snow-capped peak, a pair of master and servant were admiring the scenery in a celestial residence built on the cliff.

The man was Yuan Bai, a sword cultivator from the old Zhu Ying Dynasty. The maid beside him, Liusai, appeared emotionless, a dull presence, and not particularly pleasing to the eye.

Yuan Bai felt somewhat melancholic, not anticipating that a mere journey to Aihai Continent would result in losing both his home and country.

The maid’s hometown wasn’t precisely part of the Haoran world, but rather a renowned celestial blessed land in Aihai Continent.

The blessed land was the private property of the Liu family in Aihai. Initially discovered as a lowly blessed land with scant spiritual energy, it had been transformed into a high-quality blessed land through sheer expenditure of celestial money.

Every year, there would be a grand event known as “Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers,” where young women from the Liu family would don colorful robes and scatter snowflake money.

It wasn’t that the Liu family lacked wealth; rather, the blessed land was restricted by an invisible overarching principle, preventing it from being elevated beyond its current status.

Even the cloud cave blessed land controlled by the Jiang family of Yuguizong couldn’t compare.

Despite the inability to upgrade the blessed land, the Aihai Liu family’s God of Wealth wasn’t deterred by this. It was said that Liu Youzhou, in his youth, had jokingly mentioned creating a small cave during his time, which later became his cultivation ground.

Thus, the God of Wealth of Aihai felt that this idea could indeed work.

Afterward, the Liu family’s extravagant spending became a bottomless pit, filling it with snowflake money.

Hence, there was a humorous saying circulating in the Haoran world that whoever married Liu Youzhou would be the richest housekeeper in the world.

The man turned to the maid, softly saying, “Don’t worry; I will help you find the former owner of the blessed land.”

The maid nodded.

A woman who had just descended from the ancestral hall appeared in the corridor.

Yuan Bai and she exchanged greetings.

The woman, wearing a troubled expression, conveyed the proposal that had been discussed in the Zhengyang Mountain Ancestral Hall.

After hearing it, Yuan Bai didn’t hesitate. “I agree.”

The woman let out a gentle sigh.

Having been confined to Zhengyang Mountain, Yuan Bai smiled, saying, “Senior, there’s no need for such formality.”

After the woman departed, Yuan Bai expressed his guilt, saying to the maid, “Liusai, I will strive to obtain a direct disciple identity from Zhengyang Mountain for you, serving as a protective charm on your path of cultivation. However, I’m afraid I will have to break my promise regarding finding your master.”

The maid nodded. “It’s alright.”

The woman slowly returned to her mountain peak. Zhengyang Mountain had strict regulations; each cultivator’s sword riding and wind traversing paths were predetermined and had their own hierarchies.

Arriving at a rather humble cultivation area, the woman chuckled softly, recalling the old enmity between Zhengyang Mountain and the Wind and Thunder Garden—notably a muddy child fighting in the water, a crab flipping in the pot.

Currently, her only interest lay in the long-absent senior brother, who had taken the unprecedented step of reaching out to her, asking for help in watching over Liusai, who had emerged from the blessed land of Aihai, ensuring her safety without further complications.

However, she dared not act hastily nor touch the girl; otherwise, in her usual style, Liusai might find some fate intertwined with Yuan Bai, eventually leading to some unexpected entanglement.

The calculations of her senior brother were indeed unfathomable. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been possible for him to press the entire Yuzhou Yin Yang family into submission.

She could only manipulate and control the flow of sword fortune in the continent, honing her own path through the grand schemes of the continent.

Yet her senior brother was far beyond this.

In his eyes, it seemed he always kept an eye on the entire world.

She murmured, “Senior brother, what does it mean to consume one to eliminate another?”

At the blacksmith shop by Longxu River, Liu Xianyang sat on a bamboo chair, basking in the sun and dozing off.

Previously, he had received two water reports from Shenshou Mountain that put him in a good mood.

The first report mentioned the young elites of various realms, while the latest provided a list of the candidates.

Liu Xianyang admired not only the behind-the-scenes reviewers of these reports but also the ones who could quickly provide more detailed inside information.

Were these celestial beings wandering around all day, simply enjoying the gossip?

Liu Xianyang instantly snapped out of his daze, lifting his head with a grin. “Brother Yumi!”

It was the sword immortal Mi Yu, whom the Mountain Lord of Wei had tossed in his direction.

Mi Yu carried a bamboo chair, sitting beside Liu Xianyang, then handed him a handful of sunflower seeds.

As they cracked the seeds together, Mi Yu smiled, “I just heard from Piyun Mountain that the young man from the Lu family on Fulou Street is going to marry a celestial maiden from Qionghu Peak.”

Liu Xianyang chuckled, “Then the city lord of Qingfeng City will certainly show up at the wedding.”

Mi Yu was stunned for a moment. “Aren’t you planning to crash the party? I’ve already made plans to accompany you to Zhengyang Mountain.”

Liu Xianyang spat out the husk of a sunflower seed, grinning. “My little Ping’an must have informed you early on, asking you to keep an eye on me and not let me act recklessly?”

Mi Yu shook his head. “Not at all.”

Liu Xianyang became furious. “That guy is so heartless! He didn’t even let Brother Yumi protect me?! Damn it, once he has a wife, he forgets his brothers. He probably forgot the taste of a monkey stealing peaches.”

Mi Yu felt a headache coming on.

Liu Xianyang’s thought processes were quite unconventional.

It was no surprise that he was the brother of the hidden official.

Liu Xianyang continued cracking seeds, bending over to gaze into the distance. “If it weren’t for that water report, I would’ve truly gone to Zhengyang Mountain by now. But since little Ping’an is still alive, let’s wait until he comes back. If he’s ungrateful, I’ll be the one to be grateful.”

Mi Yu chuckled. “There’s a candidate named Ma Kuxuan from Xinghua Alley among the ten candidates.”

Liu Xianyang nodded. “Poor Banchai, having to spend every day with that foolish Ma—he must be sick of it.”

Mi Yu asked, “Banchai? Who?”

Liu Xianyang explained, “That Song Jixin from Niping Alley, now the vassal king Song Mu.”

Mi Yu didn’t delve deeper. He wasn’t particularly interested in matters related to the hidden official.

Liu Xianyang finished cracking the seeds, wrapping his arms around his head, and sighed, “Liu Daye is truly unremarkable. Not to mention I haven’t made it onto either list; even the young ten chosen from Baoping Continent before didn’t include me. There’s no reason I should be worse than little Ping’an.”

Mi Yu dismissed his complaints. 

Otherwise, in his own broken mountain, in the small county of Huaihuang, it would easily confuse outsiders, making it difficult for them to comprehend.

Mi Yu was more interested in those two lists.

The newly minted candidates did not have a ranking. 

Aside from the true martial mountain’s Ma Kuxuan, there was also the first disciple of the great demon Liu Cha from the chaotic world, Zhu Ke.

A certain female crown of the sword lineage from the Daqing Continent at Qingming Heavenly Capital.

A monk from the Shouxin Temple.

A talisman practitioner from the fifth realm, who had traveled through the Shuzhong region, the only son of the master of the Tianyu Cave, born during the Mid-Autumn Festival. 

When he was born, several white lotuses bloomed at Taiye Pool, and a celestial maiden appeared, offering him a white jade spirit flower and blessing him by touching his forehead. 

Moreover, he was gifted a talking flower that blossomed six petals, each with a character, creating an everlasting phrase. The seventh petal, which would likely be inscribed with the character “new,” was soon to bloom.

In the Bamboo Sea Cave, the girl was pure and blue, the only disciple of the Lady of Qing Shen Mountain. 

She excelled in alchemy, talismans, swordsmanship, and martial arts, mastering them all.

She was also the only one among the young ten and candidate ten whose age was noted down to the day of birth.

She was merely fourteen years old.

In the Daqing world, the unacknowledged descendant of the Baiyu family was a rogue named Wang Yuanlu.

A young man named Xu Bai from the central continent was born into a small vassal state. 

There was a market wishing bridge in the city, where the keeper’s surname was Xu. He had a son with outstanding talent, resembling a celestial being, thus nicknamed Xu Xian.

It was said that Xu Bai, in his youth, had been helped by celestial beings behind him to light his lamp while studying.

Later, while sleeping on the bridge, he dreamt of an old man with a cane wandering over, appearing to be a person of the Dao.

The boy, half-asleep, suddenly lit his lamp, and in that moment, he was surrounded by starry skies while fish swam in the heavens.

Another young man from Liuxia Continent, who was known as a dream wanderer, had a strange tale.

In the Daqing world, there was a pure martial artist nearing fifty, stuck at the peak of the mountain realm.

Besides that, there was an eleventh candidate, as the earlier hidden official had been deemed the “eleventh,” giving him the nickname “Twenty-Two.”

This person had not lived a long life; his life was practically a legendary tale filled with the most bizarre and fantastical experiences. Initially of decent talent, he only became an unnamed external disciple of a sect, suffering through many hardships, including love troubles. 

Afterward, during a journey down the mountain, he tragically perished while saving others, ultimately transforming into a half-dead ghost.

When he regained consciousness, he held the power of a celestial cave.

At a young age, he became a sect leader.

He reorganized the sect, even with a multitude of ancestors from the past, yet managed to garner respect.

It was rumored that he had crossed paths with the Confucian sub-saint who traveled through the Daqing world, as well as the three heads of the Baiyu family in his own realm, and the number one alchemist.

His celestial partner was even more astonishing.

She was the founder of another sect, having attained ascendance.

The two were starkly different in age, cultivation, and status.

The key was that the two sects had been arch-enemies for thousands of years.

Thus, when they became partners, nearly half of the cultivators in the Daqing world were left dumbfounded.

Liu Xianyang swung his small bamboo chair, murmuring, “That dream wanderer from Liuxia Continent has quite a bit of intrigue.”

At present, many cultivators from Baoping Continent not only felt proud but also lamented. Wei Jin, the sword immortal from the Wind and Snow Temple, had just passed fifty, and the vassal king Song Changjing was in a similar situation. 

Otherwise, with both Song Changjing and Wei Jin simultaneously among the young elites, holding their respective places, and with Ma Kuxuan closely following behind to secure a spot among the candidates, the minor Baoping Continent would monopolize three positions among the young ten!

Liu Xianyang suddenly turned to look at Mi Yu, saying seriously, “Brother Yumi, with your outstanding looks, if there’s ever a chance for a blooming flower for the fallen mountain, you’ll definitely make a fortune. When that time comes, don’t forget to bring me along; I’ll be your foil!”

Mi Yu widened his eyes in shock, suddenly realizing the sincerity behind the hidden official’s gaze.

Thus, Mi Yu straightened up, feeling it was only proper to involve the Mountain Lord of Wei, “We’ll share both the blessings and the misfortunes!”

Liu Xianyang immediately said, “Bring me more sunflower seeds to celebrate!”

Mi Yu took out a handful of seeds gifted by a little girl and divided them with Liu Xianyang.

In the bustling Qingfeng City, where diverse backgrounds mingled, everyone was clamoring for wealth.

With the Xu family possessing connections to the Fox Nation, Qingfeng City was known throughout Baoping Continent as a gentle haven for heroes.

A young man running a spice shop hadn’t yet reached his thirties and presented himself like a fallen nobleman.

Having settled here a few years prior, among the celestial beings populating Qingfeng City, this shopkeeper remained inconspicuous.

Those who frequented the spice shop were mainly women, either affluent housewives or beauty-obsessed young ladies.

Although the young shopkeeper appeared to be in his early thirties, his eyes seemed to possess the wisdom of someone far beyond that age.

Such a man, selling spices, even if he wasn’t overly attentive to his guests, his courtesy would suffice, and his business would not suffer.

The young shopkeeper enjoyed visiting bookshops, leading to a friendship with a well-off book merchant.

That merchant, with a considerable background, was the largest bookseller in Qingfeng City. However, in Qingfeng City, he wasn’t considered a grand lineage; compared to those affluent families frequented by celestial beings, he didn’t stand out.

Today, the shopkeeper was dragged by the merchant to his home for drinks. After getting tipsy, the merchant began calling the shopkeeper “brother,” lamenting how difficult it was to establish themselves in Qingfeng City and how challenging it was to marry a beautiful daughter, which had proven so complicated that even the future in-laws looked down on him, claiming that his business was nothing more than a small country’s wealth.

In reality, his once-sorrowful daughter had long since stopped crying every day. Just like today, she would occasionally check with her father if there were enough food and drink.

The young shopkeeper suggested a rather peculiar way of making money, twirling his cup and slowly saying, “Brother Yuan, I can’t guarantee you’ll earn big money, but I can ensure your descendants will have a steady income for three generations.”

The merchant was taken aback and asked quietly, “I’m all ears, brother.”

The young shopkeeper smiled, “I believe I’m reasonably skilled in writing, painting, and seal carving, but not so exceptional that I could become a master. However, it’s not difficult to make a living from this. I just lack the capital, and Brother Yuan happens to have it, so it’s perfect for me to show off my skills. Since you are the largest bookseller in Qingfeng City, printing books will be quite easy. I’ll be responsible for compiling a printed book for you every year, using a hundred seals. Most will be genuine, with only a few fakes. This way, you can secure solid profits.”

The merchant hesitated, “Fake? How do we sell that? It’s not that I don’t trust your seal carving, but people with money are usually discerning and hard to fool.”

The young shopkeeper took a sip of wine, smiling, “I’ve read numerous historical records and local chronicles. For instance, if I help Brother Yuan carve a seal mimicking a famous seal carver, I’ll intentionally change one character in the inscription, creating a seemingly flawed yet not entirely incorrect detail. In reality, it’ll conform to the clan record. Therefore, this deal won’t earn you any commoner’s money; it will attract those scholars who read extensively and broadly. With a little verification, they would mistakenly think they’ve stumbled onto a great fortune. Similar methods abound.”

The merchant felt slightly tempted. “Can it really work?”

The young shopkeeper glanced at the woman behind the screen. “Let’s agree on this: if I cause you to lose money on the printed books, I’ll drink punishment wine, apologize to you, and compensate you. I truly have no money. If we make a profit in the future, just remember to treat me to a cup of celestial wine.”

After some detailed calculations, the merchant felt that this could likely work. Finally, he swayed back into his seat and asked his daughter to see the young shopkeeper off.

After the daughter returned, the merchant sat at the table, asking, “Are you sure this is the accent from the old Zhu Ying Dynasty?”

The girl nodded. “Unfortunately, he isn’t a sword cultivator; he’s just a sixth realm martial artist, but he’s quite talented. As long as we can confirm he’s from the Zhu Ying descendants, we can attract him.”

The merchant frowned. “He doesn’t seem like a greedy person and speaks elegantly, quite extraordinary.”

The girl joked, “Brother Yuan considers him a true brother, but unfortunately, he thinks of you as his future father-in-law.”

The merchant couldn’t help but laugh, shaking his head. “You little vixen, you’re not likely to win his heart. If you think you can make him wholeheartedly serve the Xu family, you’re dreaming.”

The girl hesitated and said, “It could be arranged for my grandfather to personally intervene.”

“Are you joking?!” 

The merchant began weighing the pros and cons. “There’s no need to go to such lengths unless…”

The girl nodded. “Unless he can reach the Golden Body realm. It would be best if he can become a grandmaster in the distant travel realm. Our Qingfeng City lacks martial luck, not literary luck!”

The merchant said, “No rush; we’ll observe for a while. Whether your grandfather appears or not isn’t something we can decide; we need to consult the matriarch.”

The drunken young shopkeeper returned to his shop, feeling dejected. He murmured, “By the Zhuque Bridge, at the Wu Yi Alley, in front of the Wang family hall, in the homes of ordinary people. Yesterday, what day was it? What day is it today? What day will it be tomorrow? As the snow falls, I bid you farewell, and as the flowers fall, I will meet you again. Without drinking, wishes come true. When drunk, dreams become reality…”

Suddenly, a passerby bumped into the young shopkeeper’s shoulder and stumbled, saying “Sorry,” before continuing on his way.

This person returned to the merchant’s home, recounted every word the young shopkeeper had said, and then remarked, “The foundation of a sixth realm martial artist is quite good. It makes me wonder if he has already reached the seventh realm.”

The merchant and the girl exchanged glances.

The temporary martial artist who had been assigned here was indeed a true sixth realm martial artist.

As for whether the young shopkeeper would grow suspicious because of this, it was no longer important. He would soon be a fellow in Qingfeng City.

Approaching the spice shop, on a somewhat secluded street reminiscent of Qilong Alley, the young shopkeeper slowly descended the steps, noticing a little girl in a cotton coat being chased by a large white goose—she was dirty and dark, laughing and running, but when pecked, she cried while continuing to flee.

The young shopkeeper paused, watching the scene, his eyes narrowing in a gentle smile.

A woman was just at the foot of the alley, slowly walking up the steps. As she saw the scene, her heart felt heavy.

The young shopkeeper brushed past the woman.

A gentle breeze brushed against the young man’s temple as he swayed slightly. The fragrance from the pouch at his waist mingled with the lingering scent of wine.

When the young man’s gaze wasn't on her, it only made him more noticeable to the woman.

Returning to the temporarily closed shop, it was still early, and some women were already waiting, complaining. When they saw the young shopkeeper, their faces immediately bloomed with smiles.

Business was still good today.

The shop had not yet closed, but there were finally no customers for the moment. The young shopkeeper placed a small stool at the entrance, noticing a pair of childhood sweethearts walking hand-in-hand down the street.

Moments later, the boy returned, squatting down next to the young shopkeeper, saying awkwardly, “Shopkeeper, I didn’t dare to give her that pouch.”

Then the boy raised his head, encouraging himself, “Tomorrow, I will definitely give it to her!”

The young shopkeeper smiled, “No worries; you’ve already given her a gift, and she accepted it. It’s better than the pouch.”

The boy was puzzled. “But I didn’t give her anything.”

The young shopkeeper laughed, “You did. It was a box of rouge.”

The boy was confused. “What?”

The young shopkeeper looked up at the clouds and said softly, “When you look at her earnestly, she’ll blush.”

The boy thought for a moment, seeming to comprehend partially.

He picked up the small stool and closed the shop.

Returning to the courtyard, when a subtle ripple of energy gradually dispersed, the young shopkeeper still lay on a rattan chair, gently waving a folding fan, enjoying the cool breeze.

Over the years in Qingfeng City, this outsider businessman had always been so leisurely.

The folding fan had long been regarded as a symbol of coolness and a way to shield one’s face.

After some time, a woman accompanied by two maids came to purchase spices, her discerning gaze revealing her picky nature. The young shopkeeper leaned against the counter, answering whatever questions she posed.

Later, as business boomed, the young shopkeeper found himself too busy and hired a woman to assist.

Unexpectedly, the business began to plummet.

The young shopkeeper remained indifferent, leaving the shop’s affairs to the woman while he lounged in the back courtyard, enjoying the breeze while fanning himself. 

That woman, standing at the entrance of the back courtyard, lifted a bamboo curtain, gazing at the young shopkeeper lying on the rattan chair, and teasingly asked, “Do you know who I am?”

The young shopkeeper leisurely waved his jade bamboo fan, lazily saying, “You’re not that Xu family lady.”

The woman said, “You’ve actually seen her before.”

The young shopkeeper responded with an “oh.”

The woman continued, “I know you’ve covered your face; if you’re willing to show your true self, I’ll reveal mine too.”

The young shopkeeper closed his fan, gently spinning it, and finally grasped it to lightly tap his forehead. “But I’ve gotten used to your current appearance.”

The woman felt a mix of irritation and embarrassment, biting her lip, then suddenly glaring at him. “Since you’ve already realized I’m not a common woman, why do you pretend not to know? Or do you have designs on Qingfeng City? Intentionally keeping me around?”

The young shopkeeper slightly turned his head, looking at the woman who had cast an illusion, smiling, “You decide.”

The woman asked, “Who exactly are you?”

The young shopkeeper looked back at the sky, “Just a drunkard.”

The woman scoffed, “If I’m not mistaken, you don’t drink.”

He casually replied, “I’ll drink tomorrow.”

The young shopkeeper, who was about to become the third rank offering of the Xu family in Qingfeng City, still had a barrier to cross.

However, after spending so much time with him, the woman found it hard to let go.

Yet, considering the Xu family’s cunning and her own precarious position, she still retracted her illusion and gently called out, “Yuan Fang.”

Upon hearing her voice, he slowly turned, immediately opening his fan to cover his face, no longer looking at her, smiling, “Turns out you’re the ruler of the Fox Nation. What a sight to behold in the mortal realm.”

The woman furrowed her brow, waving her sleeve, sending his fan soaring. 

In a flash, she stood before him, extending her fingers to his forehead, asking several questions.

She sighed in relief, pulling back her fingers. As she gazed at the seemingly drowsy young man, she smirked and reached out once more, gently tugging at his temple.

In that moment, she found herself taking a few steps back involuntarily.

Her eyes widened, one hand covering her mouth, the other clutching her heart.

The young man furrowed his brow, waking up, and coldly said, “Get out.”

She steadied herself, chuckling, “Oh, so you’re a hidden gem of the Golden Body realm.”

He reached for his fan, skillfully handling it, then stood up, laughing, and walked over to her, gently tapping her cheek with the fan. He squinted and said softly, “Be good; just be my maid in the future. No need to pledge yourself; you’re not that good-looking, so I’m worried I’d be at a loss.”

She tilted her head, diverting her gaze, then met his eyes again, raising her hand to push aside the fan. “You truly enjoy saying drunken nonsense.”

With the fan pushed aside, he slapped her face instead.

She seemed somewhat dazed. The ruler of the Fox Nation, an Infant Transformation cultivator, had just been slapped?

He acted as if nothing had happened, looking up at the night sky. She, feeling out of control, covered her mouth and pressed her heart.

He softly said, “Don’t sneak into my room tonight; there’s no need to warm the bed in the summer.”

She involuntarily asked, “Will you remove the illusion?”

He gently tapped her forehead with the fan once more, then reclined back, “On such a beautiful moonlit night, you and I are merely a distraction.”

She was momentarily speechless, then suddenly echoed a phrase previously spoken by him, “Actually, I’m already used to your current appearance.”

He hummed in response.

She asked, “Are you truly a martial artist at the peak realm?”

He lightly nodded.

With the departure of Senior Cui and the earlier exit of Li Er from Baoping Continent, only Song Changjing remained among the ten realm martial artists.

If he couldn't quickly ascend to the tenth realm, no matter how many faces he had, he would still be unable to face others.

He only needed one or two good fights.

Thus, the earlier intuition of the Fox Nation’s ruler was not wrong; this martial madman genuinely hoped she would relay a message to the Xu family.

Years ago, when this nobleman, Zhu Lian, wandered the Jianghu, drunkenly throwing punches, he had captivated many a woman’s heart, truly capable of enchanting.

She picked up a stool, sitting beside the rattan chair, admiring the moon with him.

Two people, wordlessly.

Zhu Lian gently opened the fan, fanning a gentle breeze.

The refreshing wind brushed past their temples.

She asked, “Zhu Lian, can the Fox Nation successfully relocate to the Fallen Mountain? Can I truly trust you? I fear for my life and more so for the entire Fox Nation being implicated by me.”

He said, “First, trust yourself, then trust me. Otherwise, within three years, even if you wish to take risks with me, you’ll expose yourself. That Xu family lady is smarter than you. You are no match for her; I am.”

She remained silent for a long time, ultimately unable to resist asking, “Why would someone like you willingly serve the Fallen Mountain?”

He answered without addressing her question directly, “Who isn’t a caged bird? Who isn’t a guest in this world?”

Zhu Lian, Zhu Lian, the beauty conceals herself.

 ### Chapter 825: The Thawing Snow (Part 1)

Outside the Thunder God Temple in Mahu Prefecture, Pei Axiang couldn't help but exclaim, “What a great punch!”

It seemed that merely saying "great punch" wasn't enough to encapsulate its brilliance. As she lightly stroked her knees, her eyes sparkled with admiration, and she nodded vigorously, adding, “If we're talking about the punch's continuous flow and the weight of its intent, I can't compare to the founder of this style. It truly is a marvelous punch! Just look at that waterfall hanging from the sky; the technique is quite high, and the moment the fist strikes the ground, it lands heavily.”

In this world, no martial artist at the tenth realm was to be underestimated.

For a proud martial artist like her, who had reached the limit of her skills, to sincerely praise another’s technique was no small feat. 

It turned out that that little girl who called herself Pei Qian had delivered seventeen consecutive punches, all striking Liu Suiyu, Pei Axiang's most favored disciple. 

As a result, Liu Suiyu had to break off the flow of her intent, no longer daring to let Pei Qian accumulate her punch's weight.

Liu Youzhou, hiding behind Pei Axiang, craned his neck and whispered, “To land over ten punches and force Aunt Liu into only a defensive stance without any power to counter is just too exaggerated. If this gets out, no one would believe it.”

Pei Axiang laughed and scolded, “What do you know? Those seventeen punches from the little girl count as just one punch.”

On the plaza outside the Thunder God Temple, the air crackled with energy as Pei Axiang’s martial intent flowed smoothly, quietly protecting Liu Youzhou behind her.

As for Liu Suiyu, she didn’t receive such protection. Even though the old woman was at the Earth Immortal realm, just watching the punches from afar made her feel somewhat uncomfortable.

The plaza was filled with distorted light as the martial intent swirled, a clear sign of a pure martial artist shaking the heavens and earth with their fists.

Liu Suiyu wasn't worried about losing; there were countless martial artists on the Aiai Continent, and while Pei Axiang was the most powerful at the Thunder God Temple, the martial fortune of the entire continent meant that as long as Suiyu could reach the pinnacle of the mountain realm, she would have the greatest luck. Liu Suiyu had achieved the title of “most powerful” three times, which was quite strange. According to her master, Pei Axiang's deductions regarding the fluctuations of the world's martial fortune, Liu Suiyu's repeated failures to grasp the title of “most powerful” seemed to have more to do with the little Baoping Continent.

This implied that, besides Song Changjing of the Great Li Dynasty, there were at least two masters of at least the ninth realm hiding there.

Liu Youzhou sighed, “I’ve heard of the Fallen Mountain on Baoping Continent, and how it has a close relationship with the North岳山君, Wei Bo. The business at the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry is quite prosperous, and now they’ve formed significant trade with both the Julu Continent’s Pima Sect and the Spring Dew Garden. But I’ve never heard of such a young girl with remarkable martial skills. Baoping Continent really is a strange place, a territory no bigger than a grain of rice, yet it constantly surprises people. The martial artist Song Changjing, the sword immortal Wei Jin, the cultivator Ma Kuxuan—none of them are to be underestimated.”

Pei Axiang teased, “Where are you pointing your elbow? Are you pretending to be a married woman?”

Liu Youzhou exclaimed, “Aunt Liu has finally thrown a punch!”

From his tone, it seemed that Liu Suiyu being struck without countering was the norm.

Pei Axiang had no choice but to patiently explain to this outsider, “This little girl was both asking questions about the punches and was a guest. Given Suiyu’s age and realm, she is technically the other’s senior, making her a half-host. According to the rules of the martial world, she naturally has to take a punch first, so she’s at a slight disadvantage. Of course, the little girl has refined that punch to perfection; that’s fundamental. If the opponent’s punches are good, we have to acknowledge them. As for Suiyu’s punch, it’s something I realized when I saw a dragon crossing the river—the Great River Horizontal Style—so it won’t be too shabby.”

In fact, Liu Suiyu’s punch that interrupted the other’s intent was quite remarkable and truly passed down from Pei Axiang.

Of course, Liu Suiyu, being at the peak of the realm of martial intent, was a level above Pei Qian, which was quite important. Otherwise, if they were both at the same realm of distant travel, judging by this punch alone, deciding a winner would have to rely on life or death.

Not only did Liu Suiyu interrupt the opponent's intent with one punch, but her second punch also landed squarely on Pei Qian's temple, sending her flying several feet.

Pei Qian’s head spun as her figure twisted in the air. She quickly pushed against the ground, abruptly grabbing it to halt her movement, flipping backward. In an instant, Liu Suiyu appeared beside Pei Qian, extending half a punch. Since Pei Qian hadn’t ended up where she anticipated, if Pei Qian took this punch, it would likely have concluded their bout. A punch from the peak of the ninth realm would mean that this junior would have to stay at the Thunder God Temple for a month or so to recuperate before continuing her travels.

Liu Suiyu retracted that half punch but didn’t chase after Pei Qian’s figure; instead, she stood her ground, surprised that this little girl was surprisingly resilient.

Pei Axiang laughed, “If you could make the little girl the Liu family’s honored guest, your father would at least earn back a suspended mountain ape's residence.”

Liu Youzhou shook his head. “My father advised me never to hastily conduct business with true friends; it’s easy to ruin friendships and end business deals poorly; it’s always a loss.”

The Liu family had a saying: wealth in the world came in two forms, one being tangible money from the divine realm, and the other being goodwill.

Pei Axiang mocked, “Since how is this little girl your friend? Have you asked her, and did she agree?”

Liu Youzhou fell silent, watching the young girl with a pretty face, slightly tanned compared to the snow-white currency.

Above the Thunder God Temple, Xie Songhua let some sword energy flow like drifting clouds, providing a solid foundation for the two direct disciples. Holding a bamboo box in one hand and a mountain staff in the other, she noticed that this green bamboo staff was surprisingly heavy. Her master explained that the staff had an illusionary effect. Its real material was akin to the condensed liquid from the Thunder Pool, merely shaped into a staff. As a result, Chao Mu said there seemed to be threads of pure sword intent within the staff. After Xie Songhua received it and carefully felt the strands of sword intent, she sighed softly, saying it was a gift from the sword immortal Zhou Cheng of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Ju Xing asked, “Master, can Sister Pei’s current martial arts level compete with that of an Infant Transformation cultivator?”

Xie Songhua replied, “As long as she’s not a sword cultivator, Pei Qian has a decent chance against an Infant Transformation opponent.”

However, this female sword immortal quickly corrected herself, “I should say she has a great chance.”

Because once Pei Qian experienced a life-and-death battle, it was highly likely she would break through again and become a peak martial artist.

Seeing Liu Suiyu stop her punches, Pei Qian had no choice but to stabilize her staggering figure. She furrowed her brows slightly, seemingly puzzled as to why this senior Liu did not take the chance to pursue the advantage, which caused her follow-up punch to miss. Earlier, after being struck heavily on the temple by Liu Suiyu's intense punch, she certainly didn’t feel well, but Pei Qian truly didn’t think it would diminish her combat power. Otherwise, her years of practicing punches in the bamboo loft and the punches dished out at Lion Peak by Senior Li would have been a huge joke. The lineage of Fallen Mountain, from her master to Old Man Cui, even including that old chef, down to her, the one with the least talent and the lowest realm, had only one use for injuries: to enhance her punch's intent! And to use the illusionary method.

When the next punch comes, it would still be the Godly Drumbeat Style, and it would be faster and heavier than the first punch.

The old chef once said, “Unless I die, I won’t stop asking about punches.”

And the first important aspect of a martial artist practicing punches is to first strike down the instinctual fear of death and pain within one's small personal universe.

At that time, Pei Qian had just started practicing punches on the second floor of the bamboo loft. The old chef, while busy with an apron, cooking in the kitchen or dishing out meals, casually spoke, and Pei Qian had let each of those words pass by her ears like the wind. It wasn’t until later, while traveling in the Northern Julu Continent with Li Huai, that she found time to practice her punches daily and naturally rediscovered those deliberately forgotten words, like savoring pickled vegetables from a jar, crisp and delightful, realizing that the old chef's words held a bit of wisdom.

Liu Suiyu laughed and asked, “Pei Qian, the punch techniques of the Thunder God Temple of Mahu Prefecture aren’t just about taking hits. Once I truly strike, it won't be light. Should we treat this sparring session as merely a friendly exchange, or are we going all out?”

Pei Qian replied without hesitation, “Let’s go with the latter. Senior Liu, you don’t have to worry about my injuries from now on. Once the sparring ends, both of us standing means it doesn't count as sparring.”

Liu Suiyu nodded with a smile; Pei Qian was quite agreeable.

Since she had been able to use the Great River Horizontal to receive Liu Suiyu’s punch and then interrupt the opponent's intent, if we consider this sparring session, it would be a case of Liu Suiyu gaining the upper hand with the first punch.

However, Liu Suiyu was indeed a realm above Pei Qian, and since she hadn't allowed her opponent to deliver a full punch, then this first punch could barely be considered a tie.

Pei Qian lightly tapped her toes against the ground, fixing her gaze on Liu Suiyu. “Senior Liu’s previous punch displayed your seniority, which I appreciate! But if you continue to intentionally let me hit you, it would mean that the Thunder God Temple’s techniques look down on the Fallen Mountain’s techniques.”

Liu Suiyu laughed heartily, “Good! Then I’ll take your Fallen Mountain martial artists a little more seriously!”

Pei Qian concluded, “If I lose, it means I’m lacking in skill, not that the Fallen Mountain’s techniques are inferior.”

Liu Suiyu slowly opened a stance, her arms crackling with bolts of lightning, her golden-hued eyes narrowing. “No matter how high or low your skills may be, I only want to hear you lie down and talk!”

Pei Axiang extended her finger, rubbing her forehead. “This little girl seems used to being a brat.”

Liu Youzhou said, “Let’s not ruin the atmosphere.”

Pei Axiang straightened her back, grasping the green bamboo flute from Qingshen Mountain. “Being vague in sparring only damages the atmosphere. A proper contest, where punches are divided by skill, is the true martial way.”

Liu Youzhou, seeing the two combatants on the plaza, noticed that Aunt Liu already held the upper hand. Not yet at the Golden Core Earth Immortal level, he was merely a Dragon Gate realm cultivator, and he couldn't clearly see the figures of the two women. He could only vaguely discern their movements through the colors of their clothing. Each punch from Aunt Liu produced a thunderous aura, intertwining lightning that lingered in the air. As she continued to punch, the plaza transformed into a thunder pool formed by her martial intent.

Aunt Liu seemed like a deity of thunder, recently exiled to the mortal realm. In truth, the Thunder God Temple's martial artists were renowned for their powerful techniques. Once they reached a high level, they bore a divine aura, and ordinary techniques struggled to break through that martial intent. The greatest headache for those who fought against them was that among Pei Axiang's direct disciples, Liu Suiyu best grasped the true meaning of their fist techniques.

Seeing her student Suiyu throw punches, the old woman couldn’t help but feel gratified.

Xie Songhua shared with her two disciples through inner voice, “Behind the Thunder God Temple, there’s a small hill called the famous Thunder Fan Mountain. However, few know that nearby, that mountain is said to be the place where ancient thunder deity weapons were forged. Ju Xing, your life sword ‘Thunder Marsh’ is most suitable for tempering here, yielding great results. For a sword cultivator, if they can attain the half-immortal weapon rank, it would be vastly different from a Qi practitioner refining a half-immortal weapon.”

Of course, crafting a sword required significant wealth in divine money and rare materials, making it a bottomless pit compared to other Qi practitioners, a widely accepted fact.

For example, if Ju Xing were to refine his sword at Thunder Fan Mountain, Xie Songhua had already prepared three offensive treasures and a substantial sum of Gu Yu money as compensation for Pei Axiang of the Thunder God Temple. The problem was that Pei Axiang might not agree.

This meant that Xie Songhua would need to haggle using the sword hidden in her bamboo box.

Chao Mu cheerfully remarked, “The evaluation of the Summer Resort has placed Ju Xing’s ‘Thunder Pool’ at the B rank, quite a high rank indeed.”

Every top-quality flying sword from the Sword Qi Great Wall, such as Wu Chengpei’s “Sweet Dew,” was best suited for large-scale battlefield slaughter, hence they were rare. More often than not, the Summer Resort’s selections were strategic choices. Once off the battlefield, the competition among the mountain cultivators tends to be more intense, as the second-rate flying swords selected by the Hidden Officials showcased outstanding killing power, especially those with a B rank or higher, all possessing astonishing innate abilities like Chen Sanqiu’s “White Deer,” which attained its rank due to literary fortune.

Ju Xing’s “Thunder Marsh,” having been rated as “B rank,” was undoubtedly due to the innate abilities of his flying sword, which could be used for both dueling and battlefield scenarios, showcasing numerous talents.

In contrast, the young girl Chao Mu, while possessing two innate flying swords “Pouring Rain” and “Rainbow,” were only rated “C rank” and “B rank,” respectively.

However, the term “only” was relative to Ju Xing. Beyond the A rank, B and C ranks encompassed a total of six tiers, meaning that all innate flying swords were considered valuable.

Next to Xie Songhua, Ju Xing, Chao Mu, and even Chen Li, the direct disciple of Li Cai, all these sword cultivators taken by the transcendent sword immortal had innate flying swords ranked B or C.

Yet, the rank of a flying sword was one thing; its practical performance in battle was another, as there were always unexpected variables in the world.

It was similar to the bureaucratic ranks below—the Hanlin Academy’s officials are often favored over ordinary scholars, making it easier to gain positions and noble titles.

Ju Xing stubbornly stated, “Master, I’m not too keen on relying on others to nurture my sword.”

However, he added, “But if Master insists on me doing so, I won’t slack off in sword refining.”

When he said this, he sounded a bit deflated.

Chao Mu, worried that her master might get angry, looked on.

Xie Songhua gently pressed down on the child’s head, speaking softly, “The Hidden Official once said that once you enter the world of Haoran, don’t act hastily. Learn to adapt to local customs. Just as he learned to respect the customs of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Ju Xing, can you meet the Hidden Official’s expectations?”

Ju Xing nodded vigorously, his spirit brightening as he said, “I often review that letter from the Hidden Official, which was passed to Master through Deng Liang. The letter mentions that we should gradually learn the various customs of Haoran, not to be hasty but to remember them with care. Good or bad, we need to observe more. Once we’ve seen enough, we must think about why. At the end of the letter, it also advised us to practice swordsmanship well first. When we reach a higher realm, at least capable of self-defense, then we can negotiate with others.”

Ju Xing then glanced at the small girl beside him, holding the mountain staff, and laughed at his master, “The Hidden Official’s teachings to me in the letter were lengthy, but Chao Mu’s were quite short; she’s just a little tofu block. It seems the Hidden Official knows she’s not destined for greatness. Master, you can rest easy; I’m enough.”

The little girl’s face crinkled in complaint, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, looking pitiful.

Ju Xing, seeing her expression, felt a rare pang of regret. Sister Pei had once privately advised him not to always frown at Chao Mu, as she was just a little girl, and he was a boy. Bullying her wasn’t a mark of skill. Since they were both from the same hometown and sect, it was a rare connection, and he should protect her more, at the very least not let her be bullied by others.

Ju Xing thought Sister Pei’s advice was quite reasonable and pledged to do so. However, he sometimes just couldn't help but say a few words to Chao Mu.

Moreover, he wasn’t just anyone. Alas, it was unfortunate that no one else had bullied this silly girl Chao Mu; his master was too kind, and he was too invincible in Aiai Continent, which troubled the disciple.

On the plaza, Pei Qian was struck in the cheek by Liu Suiyu’s elbow, crashing to the ground. Immediately, she raised her hands to block Liu Suiyu’s foot aimed at her heart.

If that foot hit, it would likely end the sparring.

Pei Qian slid across the ground for several feet.

Just as she slapped her palm on the ground and floated back up, Liu Suiyu shadowed her, driving her knee into Pei Qian's chest.

This slender young girl was sent flying backward with a crash, landing on the ground.

As Liu Suiyu's feet touched the ground, she let out a breath of foul air.

After a series of punches from the ninth realm, while not every punch was at peak strength, this was the end of a pure martial artist’s true energy.

Liu Youzhou felt that today’s sparring could be considered a fulfilling exchange for both sides. He watched as the young girl stood up, spitting a mouthful of blood on the ground, only to adopt a fighting stance once more, seemingly unaware of her injuries. This reminded him of the ancient battlefield ruins where Yu Jianfu had sparred with Cao Ci, perhaps a similar scene, yet slightly different. However, he couldn’t articulate precisely how they differed; perhaps Yu Jianfu was aware of his disadvantage?

But this strange girl before him didn’t necessarily think she was inferior to Aunt Liu? The more she thought this way, the heavier Liu’s punches would become in response.

Liu Youzhou felt a twinge of empathy and turned his gaze to Pei Axiang's bamboo flute, asking, “Axiang, what’s the origin of that bamboo flute? I feel a bit awkward about that offering money; do you feel comfortable accepting it?”

Pei Axiang, upon hearing the inquiry, looked somewhat peculiar, shaking her head as she gently swirled the bamboo flute in her hand. The yellowing bead dangling from it lightly tapped against the flute, producing a crisp, pleasant sound. Pei Axiang chuckled, “The past is not worth revisiting.”

Liu Youzhou, unbothered by this, quickly lowered his voice, “The offering money from the past decade has at least doubled.”

Pei Axiang raised two fingers.

Liu Youzhou swatted her fingers away, laughing, “Axiang, you’re quite the straightforward person. It’s a deal!”

Only then did Pei Axiang say, “Have you heard of a scoundrel named A Liang?”

Liu Youzhou nodded, “What nonsense are you talking about? That elder’s name is truly well-known. Moreover, my aunt has always been unable to forget that man; who in Aiai Continent doesn’t know this? He once broke a great river in the Central Plains with a punch and even carried a clan's ancestral mountain several miles away. But that’s not what I admire most; I’ve heard he enjoys reciting poetry before a fight, and I truly respect that. He dubbed himself ‘A playful butterfly amidst the flowers, a handsome lad in the ten miles radius.’ In my opinion, that’s not just empty talk. The fairies who long for him are truly countless.”

Liu Suiyu couldn’t help but feel anxious.

Her young master mustn’t learn from that man.

Pei Axiang raised the bamboo flute, “After being beaten by that person, I received this compensation.”

Liu Youzhou couldn’t resist prodding, “Did several of you challenge him at once?”

Pei Axiang sighed helplessly, “Five or six of us, I suppose.”

Liu Youzhou gently patted her shoulder, “Axiang, you really are impressive; this will bring you some glory.”

Pei Axiang laughed, “That’s true.”

It truly wasn’t embarrassing. After all, there had been cases where ten mountain cultivators surrounded one person, and only one had managed to escape.

In fact, during the time of Haoran, that man’s swordsmanship was not particularly prominent. It was only after he journeyed for a century in the Sword Qi Great Wall, slashing down the peak demons of the Ascension realm, that the entire Haoran world, especially the Central Plains which he had wreaked havoc on, finally realized just how remarkable that doggone man was; he had previously been quite subtle and reserved in his strikes. Later, this person ascended and left the world of Haoran, heading to the Celestial Realm, ultimately exchanging a punch with the “truly invincible” Daoist Old Two of Bai Yujing, sending each other back to their respective homes, which was truly astonishing.

To share the same age and coexist in the same era, it seemed both pitiable and honorable.

It was like Pei Axiang and her group, encountering A Liang.

Those who were even earlier had met the most favored of the human realm, who had drawn the waters from the heavens with a single stroke.

Now, all the young martial artists in the world faced Cao Ci and the eleventh “Hidden Official.”

Pei Axiang pondered this and cast a glance at the two still sparring on the plaza.

Pei Qian was once again sent reeling by Liu Suiyu’s whip kick, struggling to stabilize her figure as Liu Suiyu unleashed a flurry of six punches, landing on her forehead, cheek, and neck, each double-fisted strike.

The delivery of two punches to the same target was one of the core essences of the Thunder God Temple's techniques, known as “Overlapping Thunder,” which Pei Axiang had newly developed after reaching the tenth realm. It returned to its original state, appearing as the same move, but its intent was exactly opposite, capable of severely crippling a martial artist’s intent or a Qi practitioner’s energy.

In the end, Pei Qian was struck hard in the chest by two consecutive punches, her feet leaving the ground as she fell heavily.

Yet, the slim, young woman, barely over twenty, managed to elbow the ground, twisting her body to elegantly rise again. Though she had suffered significant injuries, her martial intent remained steadfast and even increased.

Blood streamed from her seven orifices, but for a distant traveler martial artist, it was a trivial matter.

Pei Axiang nodded in approval.

Liu Suiyu’s expression became grave, and she felt a spark of frustration.

She had already exchanged two bursts of pure true energy while her opponent had not changed even once.

Of course, it wasn’t that Liu Suiyu’s martial intent was weaker; it was more that she held a mindset of training and feeding her opponent. It made Liu Suiyu wonder if this little girl was too strong. Did she truly think that the Thunder God Temple's techniques were inferior to those of the Fallen Mountain? Was she determined from the start to measure the weight of Liu Suiyu’s ninth realm punches?

Ju Xing and Chao Mu watched nervously.

They realized that when Sister Pei was sparring, she was wholly different from her usual serious self when copying books, silent while traveling, or smiling during chats.

Xie Songhua sighed in admiration; the Hidden Official had an eye for apprentices.

Opportunities to truly teach Pei Qian the techniques of punching were certainly rare, considering she was still quite young while the Hidden Official had long since gone to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Thus, the Fallen Mountain, shrouded in mist and not widely known, must have some high-level figures presiding over it.

As for Liu Youzhou, he had long been aware of the Fallen Mountain, largely due to his status as the future god of wealth of Aiai Continent, leaving him with ample free time.

In Xie Songhua’s view, the spirit and energy of Pei Qian and her master, Chen Ping’an, were remarkably similar, as if they were carved from the same mold.

However, the choice of techniques and styles they employed against their opponents differed significantly. Pei Qian conducted her punches fearlessly, consistently forward.

As for her master Chen Ping’an, he had to weigh his options heavily, rarely seeking that kind of unrestrained, varied fighting style, focusing instead on adapting to the situation, person, and place, almost to the point of being overly meticulous. Each punch was laid out and calculated to maximize benefits. But Pei Qian was entirely different; when she threw punches, she exuded the spirit of a bold hero, as if from a young age, she'd grasped the concept that “there is no one else in the world, and in asking about punches, one only questions oneself.”

Xie Songhua, being a sword immortal who loved distant travel and had connections with the tenth realm martial artists of the Liu and Jin Jiao continents, had some good friends among them. Among the two elder martial artists with vastly different styles and temperaments, the only commonality was their appreciation for the profound scope of “Heaven and Earth are ancient, one person with two fists.” Yet, while this great principle might seem simple to express and easy for others to understand, truly grounding oneself in this idea was ethereal and challenging to manifest in one’s martial way.

However, Xie Songhua had another question; since her hometown was a place of few gatherings, why did Pei Qian hold her master in such high regard?

Her two direct disciples, Ju Xing and Chao Mu, certainly understood and respected her, not only seeing her as a pillar but also as a family elder. Therefore, Xie Songhua felt satisfied, unable to find fault in her disciples. Yet compared to Chen Ping’an and Pei Qian, there seemed to be a slight difference.

Although the saying in the martial world suggests that taking a master is akin to being reborn, making the master and disciple like father and son, it seemed that in Pei Qian’s heart, the roles of heaven, earth, king, parent, and teacher had already merged into one.

In guiding children, it seems the young Hidden Official was adept at it.

Xie Songhua could only interpret it this way.

Always observing the sparring, Pei Axiang remarked, “Being able to engage in such sparring will surely be beneficial, and perhaps Suiyu will gain unexpected insights.”

Liu Youzhou muttered, “You still haven’t mentioned the origin of that bamboo flute. I feel a bit shy about that offering money; do you feel comfortable accepting it?”

Pei Axiang laughed, “There’s nothing I can’t say about it, but just consider it. Don’t go spreading it around.”

Liu Youzhou nodded.

It turned out that in the beautiful bamboo sea cave years ago, Pei Axiang, as the youngest ninth realm martial artist in Aiai Continent, was at her most spirited. At a water banquet on Qingshen Mountain, she had traveled with several friends, drinking and enjoying the scenery when she had a dispute with a scruffy man who had been secretly digging up bamboo whips and shoots. She had never encountered such a shameless person before; initially, he claimed to be the land deity of Qingshen Mountain, saying he was digging bamboo shoots to treat distinguished guests. After being exposed, he insisted he was a guest at the personal banquet of the lady of Qingshen Mountain, claiming that digging a few bamboo shoots was nothing. As a result, a young sword immortal immediately flew over to inform the mountain deity. This man, bold in demeanor, leaned against a bamboo pole with arms crossed, smugly declaring, “You’re in for bad luck for provoking me; wait till the lady orders you to leave! After this, you won’t be able to set foot in the bamboo sea cave again; I’ll take your surname.”

Later, the mountain deity replied, saying the lady did not recognize him, and thus Pei Axiang and her group chased after the thief as if driving a dog away. At first, no one took it seriously; it was more of a jest. But then, when a sword cultivator inadvertently struck too hard, the man shouted, “One punch for each little brother,” and knocked everyone down. Not only that, he buried everyone in the ground, claiming that tomorrow many jade-purged sword immortals and mountain peak martial artists would sprout from the ground as his gift to Qingshen Mountain.

When he was burying Pei Axiang, he asked her how her punches were.

Those who had attempted to break free were knocked unconscious by a single punch. Burying the crowd up to their necks was like a field of bamboo shoots emerging after rain.

Pei Axiang didn’t dare to move, lest she humiliate herself.

The young sword immortal friend who had been filled with the most earth was particularly unlucky; as the man piled up dirt, he grumbled, “You sword immortals are the most numerous and flamboyant, really annoying. Today, you’ve fallen into my hands...”

In the end, it was a female envoy from the mountain deity’s palace that appeared and saved everyone.

The man who had been squatting and piling dirt on Pei Axiang stood up in an instant upon seeing the envoy, leaning against the bamboo pole, spitting in his palm, smoothing down his hair, exposing a large forehead, and clasping his hands in greeting, calling himself A Liang, all in one breath, as smooth as flowing water.

So natural, it was merely a matter of familiarity.

The envoy ignored him and directly asked, “If you are a scholar and a sword cultivator, why resort to fighting? Is it to intentionally humiliate these people?”

She glanced at the man, who had a sword on his back, and asked, “Daring to steal bamboo shoots and whips here? Is it not related to scholars; do you intend to challenge us at Qingshen Mountain?”

The man shook his head, slightly adjusting his belt, and shyly smiled, unable to meet her gaze.

A true man never easily draws his sword.

Everything was left unsaid.

After that, a wild chase ensued, and the fellow named A Liang scurried around the bamboo sea, his earlier phrase of “Do you believe countless fairies chase after me?” proving somewhat accurate.

Perhaps the chase could also be seen as a form of pursuit.

Until he encountered the legendary lady of Qingshen Mountain, described as “beautiful, fond of going barefoot, with hair as dark as jade.”

Thus, another untold story unfolded, leaving countless versions without a definitive conclusion.

As for A Liang, he seemed to have taken a liking to Pei Axiang, striking up a friendship through combat, helping her cut a segment of green bamboo from Qingshen Mountain, which he carried out of the bamboo sea cave.

After hearing this vivid story, Liu Youzhou couldn't help but ask, “Axiang, didn’t you later return to Qingshen Mountain for a night banquet? Did A Liang end up taking on your surname?”

Pei Axiang sighed, “He meant that he wouldn’t mind changing his surname to be our ancestor.”

Liu Youzhou’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Is that even possible? There’s some logic to it.”

Pei Axiang rose with the bamboo flute in hand, intending to call an end to the sparring between the two.

If this continued, the little Thunder God Temple would genuinely end up with another patient.

This single-minded girl had already tumbled to the ground seven times.

Liu Suiyu was also getting fired up; each punch she threw was increasingly embodying her martial intent at the peak of the ninth realm. Just the Overlapping Thunder technique alone, a typical distant traveler realm martial artist would have fallen by half, bleeding profusely, and it wasn’t simply a matter of breaking bones—serious problems could develop.

Even the most solid distant traveler physique couldn’t withstand the onslaught of a peak martial artist.

The two were merely sparring.

Even if Liu Suiyu could gain martial intent through this, enhancing her skills, Pei Axiang didn’t think it was in accordance with the rules of the martial world.

In the martial world, pure martial artists need to have a sense of proportion when protecting their own people. Heavily injuring a younger girl of a lower realm to increase the martial fortune of the Thunder God Temple would be a disgrace.

Pei Axiang couldn’t afford such shame.

Thus, she called out, “That’s enough.”

Xie Songhua nodded lightly. Pei Axiang was still somewhat reasonable; otherwise, if she hadn’t spoken, Pei Axiang would have unsheathed her sword.

She would directly challenge the Thunder God Temple, questioning the oldest and highest-ranked person.

Though Liu Suiyu was still somewhat unwilling, she hurriedly retracted her punches. Pei Qian, however, seemed to have lost herself in the moment, still throwing out a punch, only suddenly awakening and forcefully reversing a mouthful of pure true energy, struggling against her surging blood to retract her punch and step back.

The slender, weak young woman swayed unsteadily, her slightly tanned face marred with cuts, one eye swollen red, making her appear quite disheveled. She tilted her head slightly, blood oozing from her ear.

As a fellow woman, Liu Suiyu’s ninth realm punches were indeed not light.

Pei Qian’s pitiful state made Liu Youzhou’s scalp tingle; it was terrifying.

Pei Qian raised her hand, wiping the red streak of blood that had trickled down from her temple to her cheek.

Liu Suiyu began to retract her martial intent, looking at Pei Qian with undeniable admiration in her eyes, nodding and smiling, “This time I didn’t win, and you didn’t lose, so we’ll call it a draw. When you break through, let’s have another spar. Whether you come to Mahu Prefecture to find me or I go to Fallen Mountain to find you, it’s all fine.”

Pei Qian clasped her fists in respect, remaining silent, as if she had something to say.

Ju Xing noticed sweat pooling in the palms of his hands, glancing at Chao Mu, who was also sweating profusely.

Chao Mu, sensing his gaze, turned and forced a smile.

Ju Xing suddenly felt a surge of anger, saying, “Sister Pei is already injured, and you’re smiling? Why don’t you just stretch your mouth to your ears...”

Before he could finish, he received a reprimand from Xie Songhua, “Chao Mu is just a little girl; whether she cries or smiles, you can’t criticize her, right? Should she learn from you and be a mute?”

Ju Xing sighed, “She’s so silly; how could she learn from me?”

Xie Songhua recalled something and addressed Ju Xing seriously, “Apologize to Chao Mu. What did the Hidden Official say in the letter? A true hero acknowledges their mistakes and corrects them, right?”

Ju Xing was taken aback. Well, it was clear that even his master knew to use the Hidden Official to keep him in check. Though he was unwilling, he still stubbornly muttered, “Sorry, I guess.”

Xie Songhua raised her hand, pretending to strike, “You’d better mean it!”

Seeing Chao Mu shaking her head vigorously, he softened and said, “I’m sorry.”

Damn, could he be any more awkward?

Chao Mu smiled brightly.

Xie Songhua unexpectedly recalled another phrase from the letter. She previously thought the young Hidden Official was overly meticulous, especially for writing something so grand for two young kids. She hadn’t realized why it shouldn’t be deemed too early; on the contrary, it seemed that the young man had written too little. Principles like “adapt to local customs and carry forth the traditions of the great sword immortal” were indeed worth repeating.

She believed that Ju Xing and Chao Mu would truly recognize the weight of the Hidden Official’s expectations in their future paths.

Standing on the distant steps outside the Thunder God Temple, Pei Axiang regarded Pei Qian with growing admiration. The martial way, which emphasizes that effort yields results, suggested that the younger the genius, the more likely they would carry hidden dangers in their physical training, hindering their future martial progress.

Martial arts masters sparring with each other often hold both advantages and disadvantages. The benefit is an increase in martial intent and refinement of techniques, but the downside is that repeated injuries, if not fully healed, could leave subtle, undetectable roots of illness, which would exacerbate problems as their realm increases. For instance, the first level of the limit realm is said to be one of great energy; if the body’s bones and meridians suffer much damage, how could one maintain that great energy?

Pei Axiang had learned this lesson the hard way. Although her name suggested a delicate and refined nature, her martial arts were famously robust, and in her youth, her temperament was quite rebellious. It was no wonder she became the third honored guest of the Liu family; it certainly wasn’t for the meager divine money, as a pure martial artist, she focused on the idea of being without external possessions, primarily concerned for her disciples’ future paths and the inheritance of the family’s fire. Don’t look at Pei Axiang’s youthful appearance; in reality, she was quite aged, much like the old man Wang Fuxu from the Northern Julu Continent. Pei Axiang had made many enemies in her youth, and Wang Fuxu was just one of them.

Pei Axiang understood her own struggles. Though she had reached the second layer of the tenth realm, her earlier excessive energy had caused significant damage. Now, Pei Axiang was trying to muster her spirit, not allowing herself to fall into despair regarding the “divine reach.”

Thus, in recent years, as she occasionally guided Liu Suiyu and her other three direct disciples, she wanted them to remember that while seeking high techniques, they should also pursue greatness, aiming for a spirit as grand as mountains and rivers, like learning from the distant sword immortals of the Northern Julu Continent. However, aside from Liu Suiyu, none of the other direct disciples or the seven subsequent disciples truly understood Pei Axiang’s meaning; none went to the Sword Qi Great Wall to temper their physiques or martial intent.

Some pretended not to understand, unwilling to head to the Sword Qi Great Wall for what they deemed a certain death. The reasoning was simple: even sword immortals could die, and martial artists would die faster. Often, stepping outside the city meant certain doom. Others believed they had reached the peak of martial arts and began to enjoy life, dedicating themselves to passing down the techniques of the Thunder God Temple’s lineage to the third generation, cloaking it as helping their master Pei Axiang spread the teachings and secure their place in the continent. Of course, some were busy serving their monarchs as military generals, needing to stabilize and consolidate their nation’s martial fortune, making it impossible for them to leave. 

In many cases, after painstakingly selecting a few promising disciples and investing years of effort in their training, as time passed, their disciples would develop their lives, and eventually, only the title of master and disciple would remain. Even if those disciples still respected their master deep down, they often found themselves unable to act on their martial paths. Pei Axiang felt a hint of regret about this but didn’t dwell on it too much.

Within her own Thunder God Temple lineage, aside from Liu Suiyu, who had become independent, there was also that young disciple, capable of inheriting the teachings and lineage.

In fact, during that time when she encountered A Liang in the bamboo sea cave, he had already told Pei Axiang to broaden her horizons. There was no need to keep staring at the tenth realm; it would not run away. She should explore greater, more expansive vistas, climb the peaks of Sui Mountain, visit the Sword Qi Great Wall, stroll through the Northern Julu Continent, and perhaps take a trip to the Tianyu Cave.

Unfortunately, at that time, Pei Axiang hadn’t given it much thought. Of course, she also blamed that doggone A Liang, who quickly changed the subject, his eyes glimmering as he drunkenly rambled on about a certain fairy’s figure.

Pei Axiang sighed deeply. Life was always unexpected, throwing a punch that was neither heavy nor light, leaving one feeling powerless to resist. Perhaps this is what it meant to feel powerless.

Tenth realm martial artists were no exception.

Pei Axiang reined in her thoughts, smiling, “Pei Qian, if you don’t mind the small place, feel free to stay here to recuperate for a while.”

This little girl who claimed to be the “founding disciple” of Fallen Mountain was truly a remarkable distant traveler, her foundational training astonishing.

Here, she wouldn’t need to recuperate for long.

Pei Axiang became increasingly curious about the Fallen Mountain, the one who taught Pei Qian punches and helped her temper her physique. Who could this master possibly be? Was it someone of the ninth realm besides Song Changjing of Baoping Continent? A limit realm martial artist? The likelihood was quite slim; otherwise, Pei Axiang would have surely heard of such a name. 

Masters of the tenth realm in the world of Haoran were exceedingly few when compared to those at the fifth realm. For instance, in neighboring Northern Julu Continent, there were only three ninth realm martial artists—Wang Fuxu, Gu You, and a martial artist of the Li surname. One ninth realm martial artist was already crucial to the transfer of martial fortune across the continent, making it hard to hide too deeply.

After the sparring, what gave Pei Axiang a headache was the female sword immortal Xie Songhua.

From any angle, she didn’t seem to come in peace.

Finally breaking her silence, Pei Qian spoke, “I have one last punch that I’d like to ask Senior Liu about.”

Liu Suiyu held up two fingers, gently pressing them against the sides of her temple, lightly kneading them.

Xie Songhua hesitated for a moment and asked, “Pei Qian, are you sure you want to do this?”

Pei Qian nodded, turning to look at Xie Songhua, a smile breaking across her face. “I’ll only throw one punch.”

Liu Suiyu turned to glance at her master behind her.

Pei Axiang considered for a moment, “Then let the little girl stay here for a few more days.”

What she meant was that Liu Suiyu needn’t be overly concerned about the differences in rank and realm.

However, Pei Axiang gathered her voice into a line, reminding her disciple, “Remember, you can make the punches heavier, but you must never harm the opponent’s foundational martial path.”

She neither wished to create enmity with Fallen Mountain nor stray from the martial intentions of a senior.

Liu Suiyu smiled in response, “Where would I dare to harm her? The more exceptional talents there are in the world, the better.”

Pei Qian clasped her fists in respect, saying, “I know I was rude to Senior Liu… and I also owe an apology to Master Pei.”

Liu Suiyu nodded. “Then we’ll exchange one punch. Consider it a gift for our first meeting, and I’ll return the favor to the Thunder God Temple.”

Xie Songhua couldn’t help but smile as she remarked to the two children, “You should all learn from Pei Qian; that’s how a true lady behaves.”

Ju Xing nodded, “I’ll learn as I wish, but I can’t say the same for someone else.”

Chao Mu gently tugged at Xie Songhua’s sleeve, her voice trembling, “Master, I’m a bit scared.”

Then Pei Qian suddenly stopped, performing a strange motion. She lifted her palm and lightly tapped her forehead.

On Lion Peak in Northern Julu Continent, Chen Ping’an had advanced from the sixth realm to the seventh realm, attaining the Golden Body stage under Li Er’s punches.

Li Er’s punches had always been precise and targeted, making many punches unsuitable for a sixth realm martial artist but perfect for tempering Pei Qian’s physique.

Thankfully, Li Huai had spent the last six months at the foot of the mountain, helping his mother with business, and had not seen Pei Qian’s training methods. Otherwise, her motivation to practice might have entirely vanished.

Practicing punches was indeed arduous. 

And the fear of hardship, years ago, Pei Qian and now Li Huai, were essentially the same.

However, Li Huai was indeed luckier than Pei Qian, as he remained blissfully unaware that he didn’t have to endure hardship.

In general, one could argue about knowledge and courage in comparison to Li Huai, but when it came to stepping out and stepping in dog poop, there was truly no comparison.

Pei Axiang suddenly asked, “What was the name of that first punch?”

Given that the intent was clear, asking about the opponent’s technique didn’t violate the rules of the martial world.

Pei Qian gradually stepped back, increasing the distance between herself and Liu Suiyu, answering, “The punch originates from Fallen Mountain, but it wasn’t taught to me by my master. It’s called the Godly Drumbeat Style.”

Pei Axiang nodded with a smile, “How old is your master?”

Pei Qian shook her head.

What could she say? She understood well what should be said and what shouldn’t. 

Things that shouldn’t be said, she simply kept quiet, treating others with sincerity.

Years ago, during the martial exchange at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Yu Jianfu had interrupted her master’s Godly Drumbeat Style.

Today, outside the Thunder God Temple in Mahu Prefecture, Pei Qian had also been interrupted by Liu Suiyu, only delivering seventeen punches.

Indeed, the world of martial artists was filled with extraordinary individuals.

Pei Qian was certain that as long as she could deliver twenty-four punches, the opponent would surely fall. Even a ninth realm martial artist would be no exception.

However, the opponent could still interrupt her intent before her twenty-second punch, just as easily severing her martial path.

Whether it was in friendly competition or life-and-death clashes, she would ultimately lose.

There was nothing to be done about it; the difference in realms between pure martial artists was a reality she couldn’t ignore. 

At that moment, all she could do was throw this one punch.

It was something she had comprehended herself.

She hadn’t thought of a name for it yet and would have to wait until her master returned home to help her name it. 

Her master had a knack for naming things.

Jing Qing, Warm Tree—how wonderful!

But looking at herself, Pei Qian, “Paying Back”? 

Pei Qian surveyed her surroundings, inhaling deeply, her spirit sinking into focus, her eyes shining brightly. 

With her knees slightly bent, one palm lifted in preparation, and a tightly clenched fist before her.

This punch had yet to be thrown; it was merely a stance.

Xie Songhua moved with the two children, riding the wind away several dozen feet.

Pei Axiang squinted her eyes from the steps, then gently stepped forward to stand before Liu Youzhou.

Behind the young girl, it was like a great sun breaking through the sea surface, emerging into the world, only to suddenly rise rapidly into the sky.

As my punch is unleashed, it is like the sun at its zenith.

Only then could martial artists across the world bow in respect.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 826: The Melting Snow (Part Two)

In the Sixth Great Dynasty of the Central Earth, the Shao Yuan Dynasty, the National Master Chao Pu sat with his favored disciple Lin Junbi, reviewing the early strategies of the embroidered tiger on Baoping Continent.

Inside the pavilion, the warmth of spring enveloped them, yet outside, the snow fell in heavy flurries. The National Master, however, was seldom talkative, allowing Lin Junbi to explain the intricate strategies of the Great Li Dynasty, both from the mountaintops to the valleys below. He encouraged Lin Junbi to articulate his thoughts freely, without fear of being incorrect. 

This was not unusual in the National Master's residence. Chao Pu believed that a significant issue in the world stemmed from the disparities in people's knowledge, yet many fancied themselves as teachers, unaware of how to truly guide others. Therefore, he had a peculiar habit of allowing his self-assured disciples, regardless of age, to emulate the teaching methods of scholars, either by elucidating principles to others or persuading themselves in their studies first, using logic to convince themselves before others.

During moments of silence from Lin Junbi as he pondered, Chao Pu would often interject with tangential topics, ensuring their teacher-student relationship remained unaffected by distractions.

Chao Pu, who towered above a multitude in the Shao Yuan Dynasty, wore a tall hat and flowing robes, his demeanor refined, holding a snow-white whisk draped over his arm. The key was that the old man exuded an air of cultured ease, appearing less like someone entrusted with state affairs by the emperor, and more akin to a leisurely scholar enjoying the beauty of nature.

With a smile, Chao Pu remarked, “The three and a half direct disciples of the Sage of Letters could barely be counted as four. Of course, there’s now an additional closed-door disciple, the Hidden Official Chen Pingan. Our Confucian lineage generally branches into six main threads, with the old scholar’s line being the most faded, particularly since one individual refuses to acknowledge his position within the Confucian lineage, only recognizing the Master and not the Temple of Literature's doctrine. These four individuals, each with their own demeanor, have been likened to the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter.”

The old scholar continued, “Regardless of who it is, being with Qi Jingchun feels like basking in a spring breeze.”

Lin Junbi asked, “I’ve heard that before Mr. Qi became the master of the academy, his temperament wasn’t particularly pleasant?”

Though his teacher could call Qi Jingchun by name, Lin Junbi still addressed him respectfully as Mr. Qi. Even in the teacher-student relationship, Lin Junbi refused to overstep boundaries.

Chao Pu chuckled, “The chill of early spring can be harsh on the young.”

He then elaborated, “A scholar should be approachable, upholding reason and propriety, but that doesn't mean merely being a pushover. The spirit and resilience of a scholar should not resemble a puddle of mud.”

“Now, the Sword Immortal, on the other hand, may evoke the sweltering heat of summer, making it difficult for outsiders of the Sage of Letters lineage to approach. He conducts his studies with stark straightforwardness, devoid of human sentiment. Later, when he shifted to sword training, he inadvertently became unmatched in swordsmanship. There’s no reasoning with that.”

“That one referred to by the old scholar as the ‘big fool’ has no definitive name. Even among the Sage of Letters’ disciples, he’s used to being called Liu Sixteen. This person vanished after leaving the Merit Forest, and no one knows where he went. Some say he’s an exceptionally old tenth realm martial artist, while others suggest he might be a ghostly immortal. It’s even rumored he has some connection with the most favored one, having once ventured into the mountains together to gather herbs and seek immortals. However, there are no records of this person at the Temple of Literature, as it seems the old scholar wrote about him only to have it secretly erased.”

“This man speaks little and is the most reticent among the Sage of Letters’ disciples. Many accounts are merely third-hand hearsay and should not be trusted. In the chilling autumn winds, he made his only move, causing a massive uproar. Ultimately, it was still the old scholar who intervened; I’m not sure whether to call it cleaning up a mess or stirring up an even bigger one, resulting in a mountain sinking. However, the righteous world only knows the aftermath and is unclear about the true cause.”

Upon hearing this, Lin Junbi expressed his confusion, “Such a hidden figure, when the Pearly Jewel Cave fell, did not make an appearance. When the Left Sword Immortal headed to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he remained unseen. Now with the embroidered tiger guarding Baoping Continent, it seems there’s still no word from him. Teacher, isn’t this too unreasonable?”

Chao Pu nodded, “Thus, there are rumors that this person has gone to another realm, to that western Buddhist country.”

Lin Junbi’s expression became peculiar as he recalled an incident where Ah Liang caused a ruckus at a certain academy. There was a famous saying that cautioned the gentlemen and virtuous: “Don’t stay up late, as it’s hard to obtain a monk’s genealogy. Be careful, or you might go bald, and the temple won’t accept you.”

Chao Pu waved his whisk, switching arms, and smiled, “Ah Liang’s close association with the Sage of Letters lineage caused quite a stir at first. After the dispute of the three and four, Ah Liang went to the Sword Qi Great Wall, undoubtedly feeling greatly disappointed.”

The old scholar then spoke of the embroidered tiger, Cui Zhan, who was once the first disciple of the Sage of Letters and had the potential to become the ‘beloved of winter.’ 

As the master of the academy and the sacrificial wine of the learning institution, as well as the deputy leader of the Central Earth Temple of Literature, he could easily become a highly regarded honorary sage. 

Most importantly, Cui Zhan maintained excellent relationships with many influential forces outside the Temple of Literature. He had collaborated with the lord of the Martial Emperor City, established a deep friendship with the elder of the Yu family, and had ties with the sword immortal whose given name is ‘Shui,’ along with the novelist elder from the White Paper Blessed Land... All of them genuinely acknowledged Cui Zhan’s intelligence and character. However, later criticisms surged, and due to the inevitable changes, Cui Zhan, who was not one to seek out friends, fell into deeper silence, only re-emerging on the world stage during a time of chaos, making it difficult for anyone to ignore him.

For instance, Chao Pu had long harbored disdain for Cui Zhan, wishing he would quietly fade away in his position as the National Master of the Great Li. Now that Cui Zhan was helping the Great Li occupy a continent, hindering the demon race’s advance to Baoping Continent, Chao Pu admired him yet could not accept Cui Zhan’s betrayal of the teachings. Chao Pu viewed Cui Zhan’s hasty rise to prominence followed by his betrayal of the teachings as the pivotal moment marking the decline of the Sage of Letters lineage.

However, as the National Master, Chao Pu was compelled to acknowledge that Cui Zhan’s accomplishments in Baoping Continent were executed to near perfection. 

The land of one continent, both above and below the mountains, was indeed under Cui Zhan’s control.

Chao Pu sighed softly, “Winter is the best time to read. Human hearts are dark and private, just like the embroidered tiger bringing them to light. Otherwise, which vassal state in Baoping Continent hasn’t experienced enmity? The hearts of the people can’t be much better than those in Tongye Continent.”

Lin Junbi lowered his head, gazing at the Baoping Continent chessboard before him, murmuring, “The embroidered tiger is truly ruthless. Both in heart and action.”

Even on a continent that was a nation in itself, amidst impending disaster, scholars resigning from official positions, and celestial masters retreating from their sects, many hidden in the mountains and forests, the Great Li Dynasty seemed to have anticipated this. Before the situation could escalate further, they quickly produced a comprehensive set of countermeasures, clearly demonstrating that they had been waiting for these individuals to resurface.

The young emperor of Great Li, Song He, issued a decree, commanding all vassals of the continent. 

All officials and generals within the continent’s vassal states who dared to defy the laws of Great Li, whether by covertly disobeying or being negligent in governance, would be held accountable according to the law, with clear evidence and regulations to follow.

Those who dared to withhold information, report joyous news while concealing the bad, or muddle through when issues arose, would have their vassal monarchs recorded. They would be required to submit detailed reports immediately to the military presence of Great Li. Local forces of Great Li had the authority to bypass the vassal monarchs and execute decisions first, reporting afterward.

The hundreds of officials who resigned from their posts in Baoping Continent, per the newly published laws of Great Li, would see their descendants barred from serving in official positions for three generations, reducing them to commoners. Not only that, but local courts would also revoke any honors or accolades bestowed upon their families in history, either dismantling or confiscating them. Furthermore, the court ordered local officials to amend the local county records to specifically name those who resigned from their posts.

At the Guanhua Academy, a scholar known as the “Great Gentleman” personally handled this matter, collaborating with the two deputy ministers of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Rites, traveling far and wide.

This scholar, known for his gentle demeanor and rigorous academic approach, was often praised, but his overly accommodating nature led to a perception of indecisiveness. However, during the accountability tour of the vassal lords of Great Li, he demonstrated a remarkably decisive and ruthless approach. He repeatedly appeared beside the monarchs, issuing stern warnings, especially one time where he bypassed the academy’s rules entirely and directly confronted the court officials, scolding them harshly, particularly targeting the noble and official scholars.

His words, which Lin Junbi learned of in the Shao Yuan Dynasty, were likely known throughout the entire Temple of Literature and the learning institutions.

“Reading is like eating excrement; during ordinary times, you’re allowed to be a corrupt Confucian. At this critical juncture, who dares to defile the sacred texts? If there’s one, I’ll hold them accountable! Which monarch dares to shield them? I’ll give up my title as a gentleman if I have to, just to knock you off your throne. Furthermore, I’ll relinquish my title as a sage to drive off another. I’d even give up my identity as a scholar to take on another monarch’s position.”

Due to the overwhelming stance displayed by this Great Gentleman, coupled with the strict enforcement of Great Li’s seemingly harsh laws, 

During this time, an old scholar suggested that at this perilous juncture, it might be better to set aside disputes and allow those individuals to make amends, which could benefit the larger situation.

The result for him was getting kicked down by a deputy minister of the Ministry of Justice who had been watching indifferently.

On the coastal battleground, the Great Li cavalry faced death first, while these pampered officials seemed entirely unconcerned.

Another deputy minister of the Ministry of Rites sneered at the scene, “Every official is adept at their role, but once in office, they forget how to be human.”

Within the court, the entire assembly of officials trembled in fear.

As for those celestial masters who shrank back in the face of crisis, the military orders from Great Li reached the halls of the various immortal sects. Those in charge of the law would lead the charge to enlist them into the ranks of Great Li’s military. If there was resistance, they would be executed on the spot. If they failed to capture them within a year, Great Li would hold the mountain tops accountable, allowing Great Li’s accompanying cultivators to take over.

One of the three Senior Supervisors of the Great Crossing, Liu Xunmei, along with the left deputy minister of the Ministry of Justice, was jointly responsible for this matter.

Lin Junbi suddenly said, “If the local civil and military officials of Great Li had another thirty years to digest the strength of the continent, it certainly wouldn’t be so hasty and laborious.”

Chao Pu nodded, then shook his head.

Lin Junbi understood and, with a complex expression, remarked, “Whether there is an embroidered tiger or not.”

Chao Pu took it a step further, “Having an embroidered tiger is certainly best. If not, as long as the scholarly lineage of accomplishments endures, Great Li's national strength can continue to ascend. Qi Jingchun has nurtured a significant number of visible and invisible scholarly talents in the Cliffs Academy for half the continent, while Cui Zhan has imparted and utilized accomplishments. This is the tacit understanding between Qi Jingchun and his senior brother, with both scholarly pursuits both restraining and complementing each other.”

Chao Pu pointed to the chessboard, “Junbi, share some subtle insights. Discuss those exquisite aspects that our Shao Yuan Dynasty wishes to achieve but cannot.”

Lin Junbi replied, “On the coastal frontlines, all strategic strongholds are divided into two armies within the Great Li cavalry. The rear army is relatively sparse, while the front takes the lead, sacrificing themselves to uplift morale and ensure the hearts of the soldiers. The rear oversees the middle army and other vassal forces.”

At this point, Lin Junbi sighed, “Often only a few thousand troops can oversee tens of thousands, which shows the might of the Great Li cavalry.”

Lin Junbi continued, discussing the reports from the celestial mountains, which could even be posted in the various vassal states of Baoping Continent, showcasing the astonishing control the Great Li Dynasty had over the cultivators of the continent.

A flying sword brought a message into the pavilion.

Chao Pu, holding the whisk with one hand, pinched the flying sword between two fingers, opened a letter sealed with purple clay from the mountains, and sighed heavily, “The Fuyun Continent could not be held. Zhou Zhenzhi has already perished in battle. Qi Tingji has begun to lead his team to retreat to the Golden Armor Continent, where he will continue to serve as the mainstay, but most likely can only strive to safeguard half of the Golden Armor Continent while awaiting reinforcements. How many of the scholarly seeds from the learning institutions will just vanish like this?”

Lin Junbi’s heart felt heavy.

Before this, there were also dire tidings; compared to the orderly retreat from the Fuyun Continent, many cultivators from there had fallen back to the Golden Armor Continent. The situation was even more dire for the Tongye Continent.

Taiping Mountain had been breached. Not a single cultivator survived there.

Having lost the Three Ranges and Four Symbols formation, the entire Fuyun Sect faced annihilation, with not a single person surviving.

The Great Fu Academy was personally assaulted by the great demon known as Zhou Mi, who used Confucian methods to suppress the academy.

This meant that the entire Tongye Continent was left with only two remaining flickers of human light, one deeply rooted in the Yu Gui Sect and the other defending against foes with the sword of the Tongye Sect.

Although the land of one continent had not entirely submerged, the fortune of the continent had largely fallen into the hands of the demon race.

Lin Junbi asked, “Teacher, what about the pure Confucian Chen family?”

Chao Pu felt even more sorrowful, as he hailed from the line of the Sub-Sage.

Moreover, the pure Confucian Chen Chunan from Nanshuo Continent was a pillar of the Sub-Sage lineage.

Chao Pu lamented, “Mr. Chen made the worst choice; when the world deemed he should die, he lived, and when he should have lived, he chose not to.”

Chao Pu stood up, gazing at the heavy snow falling outside the pavilion, murmuring, “What does it mean to die? In the eyes of the world, he became the first to die gloriously in battle for the righteous world’s ascension. What does it mean to live? The question of right and wrong; as long as Chen Chunan lives and guards Nanshuo Continent, there will be an opportunity to clarify why he chose not to die back then. Even if Mr. Chen says nothing, I, Chao Pu, and our Sub-Sage lineage will explain it for him.”

Lin Junbi rose, following his teacher, “But without Mr. Chen stationed in Nanshuo Continent, it cannot be held. Even with the mountain search map gifted by that White Mr., it still cannot protect the continent. The moment Mr. Chen chooses to abandon Nanshuo Continent for the sake of his reputation, it would seem like a grand gesture of martyrdom, but in reality, he would be the true culprit responsible for the downfall of the righteous world.”

Chao Pu stated, “As long as Mr. Chen does not leave Nanshuo Continent, all cultivators associated with Tongye Continent and Fuyun Continent will still harbor resentment towards him, even if they understand this reasoning. If this is human nature, it’s only natural, but there are countless people who only speak of grievances without understanding the reasoning behind them. Those who ascend the mountains to practice Dao only scratch the surface and cultivate strength without nurturing their hearts. The repercussions are endless.”

The old scholar’s expression grew somber, “It’s said that Zhou Mi, in the Great Fu Academy, mockingly remarked, ‘Since you Confucians are in power, why delegate authority to the secular monarchs? Knowing human hearts, why remain indifferent for thousands of years? What a good human nature is inherently good; it’s your Confucianism’s fault, so I’ll wield the demon-revealing mirror to show you all in the righteous world, whether it is truly filled with righteousness or, under the mirror, human nature’s good and evil may be fully exposed. If one Tongye Continent isn’t enough, then let’s see a few more continents.’”

This was not merely Zhou Mi’s outrageous rhetoric, as within Nanshuo Continent, how many were secretly whispering and pointing fingers at Chen Chunan?

With two continents fallen, only Nanshuo Continent remained unscathed.

And as for Tongye Continent and Fuyun Continent, if snow were to fall now, there were hardly any left to clear it away.

Chao Pu chuckled lightly, turning to Lin Junbi, “By the way, there’s at least one piece of good news: the young vassal king of Great Li in Old Dragon City has refused any cultivators from Tongye Continent to cross over. Not only that, this Song Mu has also issued a decree that any cultivator approaching within ten miles of Old Dragon City will be treated as enemies of Great Li. All Tongye Continent cultivators are not only barred from entering Old Dragon City but are, in fact, prohibited from stepping foot on any part of the coastal regions of Baoping Continent. If discovered, it’s immediate execution, regardless of identity.”

Lin Junbi exclaimed, “No wonder the embroidered tiger trusts this person to oversee the capital and guard Old Dragon City.”

Chao Pu continued, “But the bad news is that the focus of the demon race has always been on the line of Tongye Continent, Baoping Continent, North Julu Continent, and Ai Ai Continent. Prepare yourself; the first move of the Grandmaster of Tuo Yue Mountain in the righteous world will definitely target Baoping Continent. And it will surely be some grandiose plan beyond imagination.”

The old scholar glanced at the sky.

He fell silent for a moment, deliberately or inadvertently stating, “Junbi, to turn the tide when it has already fallen is a feat; to mend the mountains and rivers is another. To forge deep friendships with upright gentlemen and pure individuals is essential, but one must also learn to navigate through the scheming and lowly people; only then can you truly accomplish something substantial. Otherwise, at most, you’ll remain a mere academic, a teacher, or a distinguished scholar, which is not enough.”

Lin Junbi bowed, “Teacher’s teachings, I am grateful. For now, it’s hard to prevent the heavens from tilting; I wish to be a craftsman mending the heavens.”

Chao Pu nodded.

Now, as the snow grew heavier, it already felt like a bone-chilling wind, but once it melted, the roads would become even muddier.

The time of snowmelt is the coldest, revealing the hearts of men.

Suddenly, the old scholar asked, “That Hidden Official, what kind of person is he?”

Lin Junbi pondered for a moment before answering, “A good person, quite intelligent.”

Chao Pu muttered to himself, “With Qi Jingchun gone, the Left is trapped in the Tongye Sect, and Cui Zhan is stationed at Baoping Continent, while the closed-door disciple remains at the Sword Qi Great Wall. The old scholar is truly... generous.”

Lin Junbi couldn’t help but interject, “Chen Pingan once said that true feats can be seen everywhere in the world; the light of human kindness is always within reach, depending on whether we are willing to open our eyes to see the world.”

Chao Pu laughed, “In a snowy night, a traveler far from home, even a flicker of light can soothe the heart. On the journey of life, indeed, every little light we see, even amidst the darkness of the world, will brighten the heart.”

The old scholar suggested naming the fifth realm the Righteous World, but the Central Earth Temple of Literature did not agree, and this matter remained unresolved.

Chao Pu suddenly burst into laughter, “Well, if we don’t discuss good and evil in terms of human nature, but rather focus on good people and kind hearts, allowing the Confucian lineage to exert more strength in education, this statement clearly comes from you, aimed at our Sub-Sage lineage scholars.”

Lin Junbi felt a bit anxious.

Another flying sword message arrived.

After reading the secret letter, Chao Pu fell into a daze.

Lin Junbi softly called out, “Teacher?”

Chao Pu snapped back to reality and said, “Within our lineage, a moral essay has been specifically written to explain what pure Confucianism is.”

Lin Junbi’s expression darkened, “Is it incited by someone behind the scenes, or is it from the heart?”

Chao Pu tossed the letter aside, smashing it with his whisk, and scoffed, “It’s truly foolish.”

Lin Junbi rubbed his face vigorously.

The old scholar self-deprecatingly said, “I suddenly envy Cui Zhan a little.”

---

The sword cultivators, aside from the central Ascension City, under the leadership of the Criminal Officer lineage, worked alongside commoners to open up eight spiritual peaks brimming with aura around the city. They engaged in large-scale construction, either building residences on the mountains or establishing cities by the water, continuously crafting various formations and secretly placing suppressive items.

This essentially created an alternative barrier covering a thousand miles.

This would be the first layer of the Ascension City’s geographical realm, and it would naturally continue to expand outward.

A sword cultivator traveling afar became the first visitor to Ascension City.

In fact, he wasn’t exactly a guest in the true sense, but more like half a family member.

This was Deng Liang from Ai Ai Continent, a former sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage of the Sword Qi Great Wall, who had spent several years in the Summer Palace, naturally familiar with Xu Ning and Guo Zhujiu.

Upon leaving the Upside-Down Mountain, Deng Liang, as a bottleneck sword cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage, received a personal letter from a young Hidden Official.

His sect quickly began operations in secret to facilitate Deng Liang’s entrance into the fifth realm, where he would seek opportunities for breakthrough, which would bring extra blessings. This was beneficial for both Deng Liang and his sect.

In the letter, the young Hidden Official advised Deng Liang that if he could persuade the sect's Patriarchs to allow him to enter the new realm, it would be best to go to Tongye Continent rather than Nanshuo or Fuyun Continent, but he must not speak of this to the sect. 

Ultimately, at the end of the second year of Jia Chun, everything was in place, and Deng Liang chose to embark on a journey through North Julu Continent, Baoping Continent, and Tongye Continent. He purposefully passed by the Taihui Sword Sect on the soaring peak of North Julu, the Floating Duck Sword Lake in the central region, and the Falling Down Mountain and Wind and Snow Temple in Baoping Continent, without making any visits.

Even though his sect had already communicated with a learning institution in the Temple of Literature to secure a significant pass, Deng Liang still harbored concerns about unexpected events, fearing that Tongye Continent, with its vastness, would be filled with muddled minds. In truth, his fundamental issue was that he had an exceedingly poor impression of Tongye Continent and held a similar view of the three academies there. Deng Liang had even prepared himself to be turned away.

Deng Liang arrived at the gates of Tongye Continent at the turn of spring and summer in the third year of Jia Chun. He then changed his mind and stayed for nearly three years, guarding the gates alongside his seniors and fellow sword cultivators until the very last moment before the gates were about to close, when he finally entered the fifth realm.

He then rode his sword toward Ascension City.

On the way, thanks to the battles he fought alongside his seniors at the gates for three years, he accumulated sword intent. With the guidance of his seniors, he finally reached the Jade Purity stage in the new realm.

Just southeast of Ascension City, Deng Liang encountered the leader of the Criminal Officer lineage, Qi Shou, who had also achieved the Jade Purity stage.

Qi Shou appeared pleasantly surprised at Deng Liang's arrival and welcomed him warmly, taking him on a tour of Purple Mansion Mountain. They visited an ancient stone tablet, now designated as a forbidden area, inscribed with two lines of ancient script: “Six Caves, Danxia Xuan Shu, Three Pure Purple Mansion Green Chapters.” 

Qi Shou had nothing to hide from Deng Liang, candidly stating that at the foot of the mountain, they had unearthed an ancient jade box, but they were currently unable to open it. They were too afraid to act hastily, worried that a single misstep might trigger ancient prohibitions and lead to the destruction of both the box and its contents.

Even though Deng Liang hailed from the old Hidden Official lineage, he genuinely appreciated Qi Shou’s sincerity, as they had once collaborated on the battlefield, displaying remarkable synergy. In fact, Qi Shou had a mediocre impression of the younger outsiders like Cao Gun and Xuan Can, but he felt a special affinity with Deng Liang.

Upon reaching Purple Mansion Mountain, Deng Liang wasn’t in a hurry to enter Ascension City.

After all, he would not be able to leave this new realm without reopening the gates in a hundred years.

Deng Liang was not foolish enough to think he could break through to the Ascendant stage within a hundred years.

Fortunately, there was a year name.

It was said that the timing and weight were still subjects of uncertainty.

Upon hearing this, Qi Shou was slightly taken aback, clearly not fully grasping the significance of these two matters.

Deng Liang didn’t conceal his thoughts, directly explaining to Qi Shou why these two matters should not be underestimated; one pertained to the manifestation of a certain Great Dao linked to seasons and historical laws, while the other determined the measurement and calculation of the weight of all things in the world.

As for the currents swirling within Ascension City involving the Criminal Officer, Hidden Official, and Treasury lineages, Deng Liang pondered briefly and could roughly guess the general situation.

After all, when it came to sect affairs and the proliferation of mountains, the scholars of the righteous world were far more familiar than those from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Deng Liang would not actively involve himself in these matters.

Thus, Deng Liang followed Qi Shou into Ascension City, but he did not resume his identity as a sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage; instead, he became the first named offering in the history of Ascension City.

He then met Dong Budu, a girl who made Deng Liang realize he was destined to seek without obtaining.

Dong Budu had just returned to Ascension City and had gone to the Shattered Peaks Tavern for a drink. As Deng Liang walked down the familiar street, he noticed the tavern was without the head and second head of the establishment. Business was still decent, but the acting manager had become a hunchbacked outsider, who was currently sharing a table with Dong Budu, drinking together. Luo Zhenyi and Guo Zhujiu were also there, each occupying a long bench. The manager, whose surname was Zheng, was all smiles as he rambled about the customs of Baoping Continent.

As Deng Liang took a seat, the man was just talking about the Pearly Jewel Cave and the young Hidden Official’s past.

No one was particularly polite to Deng Liang; after a brief greeting, the small talk faded. Deng Liang mentioned that he had finally broken through, receiving a congratulatory remark from Luo Zhenyi, while Guo Zhujiu applauded. Dong Budu didn’t even bother to say anything.

Deng Liang, on the other hand, enjoyed this familiar atmosphere, as it did not make him feel like an outsider.

Guo Zhujiu continued to help Zheng Dafeng pour drinks.

Zheng Dafeng continued recounting a little story about how Chen Pingan earned a copper coin by sending a letter.

Dong Budu was there to drink away her sorrows, casually listening to Zheng Dafeng’s ramblings, while Guo Zhujiu insisted on getting more stories about her master.

As for Luo Zhenyi, she simply listened and occasionally took sips of her drink, remaining silent.

Guo Zhujiu listened intently as Zheng Dafeng shared about her master, recalling how he used to rush through Fulu Street, Peach Leaf Alley, and Zhalan Gate every day, and that was where he first encountered Ning Yao.

As for the handsome and charming Zheng manager, he was certainly a witness to the events.

Guo Zhujiu felt as if she was hearing the most wonderful story in the world, exclaiming, “No need to think; my master must have recognized my master as soon as he saw her!”

These were tales that her master had never spoken about, nor had her master ever mentioned.

Zheng Dafeng nodded, “Yes, yes! At that time, your master was already quite astute, knowing early on the difference between women who trained in martial arts and those who didn’t. He left me stunned for days trying to figure it out. It’s not surprising; a poor child learns quickly.”

Guo Zhujiu tilted her head, frowning, thinking that Zheng manager's words didn’t quite add up.

Luo Zhenyi was slightly surprised, lowering her head to sip her drink, but still said nothing.

Zheng Dafeng cleared his throat and continued, “Let me tell you about the Mud Bottle Alley. It’s truly a place of good fortune. Aside from our Falling Down Mountain’s master, there’s also a ruffian called Gu Can, and a sword immortal named Cao Xi. The ancestral homes of the three families are all clustered in that one alley.” 

At this point, Zheng Dafeng felt a little awkward, knowing that discussing this in the righteous world could be intimidating. However, discussing it with sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall was rather pointless.

Guo Zhujiu leaned on the table and suddenly said, “My master has spent all those years wandering around Mud Bottle Alley, leaving the ancestral home alone, and returning home alone. Wouldn’t he be very lonely?”

Zheng Dafeng rubbed his chin and nodded, “Probably a little lonely. Anyway, every time your master returns home from a long journey, he always goes to sit for a while at the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley.”

Guo Zhujiu whispered, “Zheng manager, what did my master look like when he was young? I can’t even imagine. I can’t even imagine what he was like as a child.”

Zheng Dafeng laughed, “He was dark and thin from the sun and wind, not very tall, so he was quite inconspicuous. When he was even younger… aside from wearing straw sandals, he probably looked about the same.”

Guo Zhujiu scratched her head, continuing to lean on the table, staring at the white wine bowl before her, “I always thought my master just poofed into a young man, and then poofed again into the master I know.”

Zheng Dafeng took a sip of his drink and fell silent.

Deng Liang suddenly said, “Someone recently selected a list of the ten youngest individuals across the realms, and the unnamed ‘Hidden Official’ was ranked eleventh. At the very least, it shows that the Hidden Official is still at the Sword Qi Great Wall and has reached the pinnacle of martial arts, becoming a Golden Core sword cultivator.”

Guo Zhujiu sat up straight, “Really?!”

Deng Liang nodded, smiling, “Absolutely true.”

Deng Liang glanced at Luo Zhenyi.

Dong Budu shot a glare at Deng Liang, who was not being sincere.

Deng Liang poured himself a bowl of wine as punishment, resulting in Luo Zhenyi giving him an unhappy look.

Deng Liang had to change the subject, asking, “Has Sword Immortal Ning not returned to the city yet?”

Guo Zhujiu sighed, “What can she do? My master’s wife must miss my master more than anyone else, but she can’t bear to drink away her sorrows in front of us, so she runs off alone, far away, where no one can see her, desperately missing my master. Sigh, if only my master’s wife had brought me along, I could have lent her my sleeve to wipe away her tears…”

Just then, Guo Zhujiu’s head was suddenly pressed down, her forehead touching the table. 

As her head pressed against the table, Guo Zhujiu could only laugh and then murmur, “Master’s wife… why did you come back and not explode a series of thunderclaps in the sky riding a sword? I didn’t even have the chance to announce to the world that our master’s wife is the only immortal in this realm…”

Ning Yao pressed down twice forcefully, causing Guo Zhujiu’s small head to thud on the table, and only then did she release her grip. Before taking her seat, she called out to Zheng Dafeng, “Uncle Zheng,” and then greeted Deng Liang.

This was the first time Zheng Dafeng had seen Ning Yao since their parting at Pearly Jewel Cave. The young lady was no longer a young girl after many years; she had now become a stunning immortal.

Zheng Dafeng laughed, “Ning Yao, rest assured, at least in this Falling Down Mountain, where I have watched over for many years, Chen Pingan has never harbored any ill thoughts toward anyone.”

Ning Yao smiled and paid no mind.

Guo Zhujiu sat next to Ning Yao, raising her hand and whispering, “Master’s wife, before you came, I calculated that my master must have already reached the pinnacle of martial arts and is about to become a Jade Purity sword cultivator.”

Deng Liang felt a bit helpless; if only Gu Jianlong, Cao Gun, and Xuan Can were here, then it wouldn’t be just Jade Purity; the Ascendant stage would also be within the grasp of the Hidden Official.

In this fifth realm, despite the gates of Fuyun Continent and Tongye Continent being closed, chaos still reigned. Remarkable people and odd occurrences were countless.

The son of the cave master of Tianyu Cave, Shu Nan Yuyan, after suffering from heat stroke, built a transcendent platform and met a black-clad scholar who visited, finding a kindred spirit.

The latter was named Chen Wen, hailing from North Julu Continent, yet he was not a sword cultivator.

Then there was a practicing Qi cultivator named Yang Hengxing, who excelled in talismans and had a terrible temper, constantly clashing with the cultivators from Tongye Continent. As a result, he drew the wrath of many and was hunted down by nearly a hundred practicing Qi cultivators. Unexpectedly, he quietly ascended to the Nascent Soul stage and the far-travel stage, turning the tables and killing more than half of his pursuers.

It was also rumored that a female sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall had flown south alone, coming extremely close to the southern gate and slashing several people.

Meanwhile, someone from the Central Earth Dynasty set out on a journey and happened to pass by the Wish Bridge.

In the night, a figure in white, reading alone on the bridge, Xu Bai stood there, gazing at the bright moon atop the mountain across the way, where a horseman rode along the ridge.

Xu Bai focused his gaze and saw a woman in red riding a white horse, a narrow blade and a wine gourd hanging at her waist, as if she were riding into the moon.

In the Lei Gong Temple of the Ma Lake in Ai Ai Continent,

Pei Qian, at the eighth realm, delivered an unnamed punch equivalent to the completion of the ninth realm.

Liu Suiyu, at the pinnacle of the ninth realm, countered with a punch from the tenth realm.

They exchanged blows.

Pei Qian’s punch served both to question and to receive the blow, sliding back several dozen feet. Although she was drenched in blood and her body shook several times, she still gathered her breath, causing her feet to sink into the ground several inches, before she finally fainted yet remained standing.

Liu Suiyu was sent crashing through the outer wall of the Lei Gong Temple, stumbling within and spitting out a mouthful of blood.

Pei Ah Xiang quietly murmured, “Another one with the surname Pei.”

Pei Qian woke up three days later and spent more than a month recuperating in the Lei Gong Temple.

During this time, she paid no attention to the stranger named Liu Youzhou and merely inquired about matters related to the Sword Qi Great Wall with Aunt Xie and the students Ju Xing and Zhao Mu.

For example, she asked what her master had done and said after she left the Sword Qi Great Wall and he took on the title of Hidden Official.

She also asked Aunt Xie whether it was difficult to become a Golden Core sword cultivator.

Ultimately, before leaving, Pei Qian took a trip outside, crafting an ordinary material book box and a bamboo staff as parting gifts for Ju Xing and Zhao Mu.

Since they referred to her as Sister Pei and she was over ten years their senior, she was essentially half an elder.

First, she thanked and bid farewell to the two predecessors, Pei Ah Xiang and Liu Suiyu, before loading the new bamboo box on her back. She held the hiking staff and said her goodbyes to Aunt Xie and the three students outside the Lei Gong Temple.

She bent down, smiling at the two sword cultivator seedlings, “Practice your sword well, read more, travel more, and try to stay together and leave less.”

Ju Xing, with the new bamboo box on his back, nodded vigorously, “Sister Pei, wait for me! Next time we meet, I’ll definitely be two realms higher than someone!”

Zhao Mu clutched the hiking staff tightly, nodding as if pecking at rice, “Sister Pei, we’ll visit Falling Down Mountain in the future, and you must be home!”

Pei Qian smiled, stood up straight, and patted the heads of the two children, “As long as you have your master by your side, there’s no need to rush to grow up.”

Aunt Xie asked the two disciples to stay, and she escorted Pei Qian partway.

Ju Xing and Zhao Mu looked on from a distance, wondering if Sister Pei had grown a little taller?

Liu Youzhou sat on the outer steps, lost in thought, not paying attention to the Lei Gong Temple.

He took out a snowflake coin, holding it high; it was indeed beautiful. 

In the distance, Pei Qian merely looked down at the ground, softly saying, “My master once told me in our hometown that his ability to take care of himself is no boast; it’s rare in the world, and my master is not lying.”

Aunt Xie had no words to respond.

Pei Qian hurried away, then smiled and walked backward, waving goodbye to Aunt Xie.

Aunt Xie smiled, “Be careful on the road, take care of yourself.”

Pei Qian turned back around and quickened her pace, executing a six-step stance before suddenly lifting off the ground, riding the wind to travel across the heavens.

Liu Youzhou looked up; the snowflake coin was beautiful, and the moonlight tonight was also beautiful.

In the Righteous World, 

The old scholar revealed himself in the northern part of the Fuyun Continent, shouting with his heart, “Hey, hey, hey, Brother Bai, are you there? Answer me! Damn it, there’s someone asking if you have an immortal sword in hand; if it were me, I absolutely couldn’t tolerate it!”

Daoist Sun unexpectedly returned to the gate where the two realms met, proclaiming loudly, “What sword? Just take it!”

Thus, a scholar, originally guarding the peach blossoms and the grass hall, easily cleaved through the sky with a sword and re-entered the Righteous World’s Fuyun Continent, looking at a great demon on the throne as the scholar calmly said, “Alright. Bai has arrived.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 827: The Fourteen Realms

By the cliffs of the half-completed Sword Qi Great Wall, a figure in a gray robe fluttered in the wind.

Liu Bai had come here to bid farewell to her senior, the Dragon Lord. She had just stepped into the Nascent Soul realm and had received two pure sword intents as gifts.

Most of the over ninety aspiring sword immortals from the Tuo Yue Mountain had already broken through or obtained a portion of sword intent, allowing them to leave the city wall one after another, riding their swords towards the vast world, heading for the battlefield of the Three Continents.

These strands of pure sword intent, drifting between heaven and earth for a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand years, were impartial. As long as one's sword heart was clear, those who resonated with them would be recognized as sword cultivators by the world and would gain an opportunity—a pure inheritance devoid of any so-called incense or master-disciple relationship.

There was only one type of existence that could never attract the favor of sword intent, regardless of talent or aptitude.

For example, Sha Yue, one of the ten outstanding youths of the Wild World, and the girl nicknamed Doukou.

Liu Bai spoke softly, “Dragon Lord, I am about to leave for Tongye Continent to follow my master and senior brother. Is there anything you would like me to convey to him?”

The wind howled atop the city walls, but the figure in the gray robe remained silent.

Liu Bai did not dare to rush this unpredictable senior. She was in no hurry to leave the city walls, so she gazed across the cliff, but could not see the figure in the bright red robe.

Under the command of the Jiazi banner, a powerful mountain-water barrier had been set up against the half-completed Sword Qi Great Wall, thoroughly isolating the two realms. Liu Bai could see the scenery on the other side clearly, while the opposing city wall was shrouded in thick fog.

The Dragon Lord beside her was indeed too enigmatic. As one of the three old sword immortals who had sought swords at Tuo Yue Mountain a thousand years ago, he had once been a close friend of Chen Qingdu, and they had once swung their swords together on the vast expanse of the earth, seeking swords in the heavens. After becoming a convict, he ultimately became a puppet of Tuo Yue Mountain alongside Guan Zhao. However, unlike the scattered soul and confused mind of Guan Zhao, the Dragon Lord had willingly abandoned his physical form, even allowing the White Crystal Throne to crush his head. On the battlefield, he had slain the last sword immortal of his lineage, Gao Kui.

Gao Kui sought the sword, while the Dragon Lord wielded it; that was all.

In the end, he was personally severed from the last ember of the sword path by the elder.

Liu Bai truly did not understand the thoughts and actions of the Dragon Lord.

In fact, Liu Bai could not even fathom Li Zhen, who still remained on the city wall, seemingly determined to clash head-on with that young hidden official.

As each aspiring sword immortal from Tuo Yue Mountain achieved their own successes, the flow of sword fortune naturally made the half-completed Sword Qi Great Wall thinner and thinner, placing that guy’s situation increasingly in jeopardy. For the stability of the half-completed Sword Qi Great Wall was closely related to the sword path’s fortune; surely that young hidden official, who resonated with the half-completed Great Wall, would sense this clearer and more acutely than anyone else.

The ordinary folk below, muddled and ignorant of their fate and longevity, were blissfully unaware of their approaching old age or when their time might come.

However, that young hidden official, like someone staring intently at a longevity lamp in the ancestral hall every day, could only watch helplessly as its flame dimmed with each passing day.

The Dragon Lord finally spoke, “Tell your master to summon Liu Cha back here to exert his full strength in swordplay. Within a year at the latest, we must force that kid into the Jade Pure realm. Delay, and there will be changes.”

Liu Bai was taken aback, unsure why the Dragon Lord insisted on that person reaching the Jade Pure realm. Could it be? No, she must not let that person’s words influence her state of mind; the Dragon Lord could not possibly be connected to him.

Thus, with doubts in her heart, she asked directly, “Dragon Lord, why is that? Please enlighten me!”

The Dragon Lord smiled and explained, “For Chen Ping’an, breaking the Golden Core and forming the Nascent Soul is merely a matter of course. Becoming a Nascent Soul sword cultivator is not easy, yet not too difficult either; he just needs some time for refinement. He is not the slightest bit anxious about raising his Qi Refining realm. Instead, he is more focused on how to enhance his fist intent. This is perhaps what that little mad dog considers urgent. After all, cultivation relies on oneself; he has always been like climbing a mountain, yet when it comes to practicing his fists, he is unwavering—how could he not feel anxious? In the vast world, martial artists at the summit realm are indeed impressive, but is that enough here?”

Liu Bai felt dizzy and stammered, “Didn’t he say he was about to reach the Jade Pure realm?”

“What you believe is what you believe,” the Dragon Lord scoffed. “The truth is he was just trying to scare you and Li Zhen. I originally intended to say he was about to reach the Nascent Soul realm, but seeing you all take it seriously, I didn’t bother to clarify.”

Liu Bai let out a soft sigh.

The Dragon Lord looked across, “Isn’t it hard to discern this kid’s temperament? Everything he sees in his eyes, regardless of distance or difficulty, as long as he sets his mind to it and there’s a path to follow, he won’t feel the slightest bit anxious; he merely works quietly, step by step, making it seem easily attainable. But don’t forget, what he is worst at is creating something out of nothing, relying solely on himself to find that ‘one’. He has the least confidence in this.”

At this point, the Dragon Lord smiled and asked, “Do you doubt this?”

Liu Bai was at a loss for words.

The Dragon Lord’s words left her feeling both convinced and doubtful.

The Dragon Lord helplessly said, “It seems he truly has frightened you with those two life-bound flying swords of his. Let me ask you, is a young martial artist at the ninth level, who has become a hidden official as a foreigner and is a clever person capable of commanding respect, ever able to comprehend a true punch belonging to himself? Has he? No.”

Liu Bai suddenly understood and nodded gently.

The Dragon Lord continued, “Every action is within the rules; you all have forgotten his other identity—he is a scholar. Self-reflection, self-restraint, and caution are all part of his cultivation, but they also bind him heavily.”

Therefore, the more so, the less he should have the chance to truly comprehend a punch. That would mean the young hidden official, who had focused on refining his heart, could potentially draw outlines for the world with his own strength. Especially, he must not truly understand a sword. Generally speaking, if something is unfair, it will resonate; this young man has enough pent-up emotions: anger, killing intent, resentment, and sorrow...

When he eventually consolidates all this, his sword may very well change the colors of heaven and earth.

At this point, the Dragon Lord condensed countless strands of fine sword qi, forming a blurry figure, reminiscent of how Chen Ping’an first appeared at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The Dragon Lord extended a hand to disperse the mountain-water barrier and continued, “If he wishes to cultivate his heart step by step, then we must force him to take shortcuts, to act irrationally. Even if he becomes a Nascent Soul sword cultivator, it will still be difficult for him to enter the Jade Pure realm in haste. In a rush, he will likely have to use a shortcut secret method that incurs a loss in the height of his path as a price, compelling him to drink poison to quench his thirst. Once he enters the Jade Pure realm, he will completely share the fate of the remaining half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, truly becoming the second Chen Qingdu.”

Liu Bai glanced at the opposing cliff, finding no sign of that person, and tentatively asked, “Is it really that difficult to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

“That’s why you all worry about him reaching the Jade Pure realm; in fact, he fears it even more,” the Dragon Lord nodded. “If he cannot reach the Jade Pure realm and is stuck at the pitiful level of a true Nascent Soul or a pseudo-Jade Pure, continuing to cling to the city walls would be better. With Liu Cha’s sword strike, the opposing city wall would be split in two again, and he would be injured at the root of his path, left half-alive. Even if Liu Cha strikes several more times, he wouldn’t die, but his cultivation path would be utterly ruined. The sword path would lead to a dead end before the martial path, and his resonance with the Sword Qi Great Wall would become meaningless. Even if he reached the tenth level of martial arts, what good would it do? He would merely be waiting to be slaughtered, sitting there and waiting for death. Sooner or later, whether it be me, or you returning to this place, or Shou Chen, Fei Ran, whoever strikes, it will be the same. Every sword will damage the root of his path.”

When others ascend the city, they are merely visiting a grave; within the grave mound, there is a living person, but in truth, they are no different from the dead.

Liu Bai seemed to see the light at the end of a tunnel, as if she had suddenly found clarity.

The only eyesore was that after the Dragon Lord deliberately opened the barrier, that figure in the bright red robe seemed to arrive as promised. She saw him holding a narrow blade, lightly tapping it on his shoulder as he slowly approached, ultimately standing across from the cliff.

With the narrow blade resting on his shoulder, they stood in opposition.

Although Liu Bai had just stepped into the Nascent Soul realm, she felt no joy; instead, she was filled with deep concern, even more so than if she had fallen from grace.

As a former prominent figure among the hundred sword immortals of Tuo Yue Mountain, unexpectedly stepping into the upper fifth realm of sword immortals due to a siege had suddenly become a burden. Until she truly stepped into the Jade Pure realm, Liu Bai would find it hard to let go. Especially when she thought about how to break through the Nascent Soul bottleneck in the future, she would have to face that inner demon, making her achievement in the Nascent Soul realm feel like a step closer to that person. The horror of the inner demon lay in the profound truth that the higher the path, the stronger the demon. Talent, law, realm, and even disposition seemed like clouds drifting in the sky; how could she ever surpass the solid rock that was that inner demon?

Many who had reached the upper fifth realm could conquer their inner demons primarily because they were initially unaware of what the inner demon was. Accepting it as it came made it easier to break through the bottleneck.

But if, when facing her inner demon, that young hidden official had already perished, Liu Bai would rather that inner demon be Chen Ping’an.

Because then, deep down, she could maintain a sliver of clarity, knowing that the inner demon was a thing of the past.

After hearing the Dragon Lord’s words today, Liu Bai’s heart steadied. She looked at the person across from her and smiled, “Please convey my farewell to the Hidden Official. I hope we can meet again.”

With this certainty in her heart, Liu Bai felt her sword heart grow even clearer, making her eager for the originally lopsided sword contest to come.

That person wore a smile, unexpectedly remaining silent, refraining from speaking to disturb her resolve.

Liu Bai could see that the other party had not been well these past few years. After finally stepping into the summit realm, their appearance had stabilized, yet they grew more haggard by the day.

For someone who had long resided in the mountains, unaware of the seasons, sleeping for years or even decades, like a dead dragon lying in a deep pond, or a statue seated in a temple, it was not surprising.

Take the Fire Dragon Zhenren from the Bei Ju Lu Continent, who was famously known for his deep slumber, draped in snow as clothing.

And the newly ranked one of the ten outstanding youths, the dream traveler from Liu Xia Continent, was likely also a fellow practitioner of the Fire Dragon Zhenren.

Or perhaps one who sat in forgetfulness, diligently cultivating for years, only pausing for a brief moment to nourish their soul. Such brief rests were significant, resonating with the concept of “great death of the human body,” and were greatly esteemed in mountain cultivation as a method of deep sleep, allowing one to be free of all delusions. Thus, compared to the most ordinary night’s sleep of mundane people, this method was more beneficial for nurturing the three souls and seven spirits, providing a sweeter experience for Qi Refiners.

The gaze from above, the intention of sitting in meditation, indicated a state of tranquility without dreams, which was a sign of a Qi Refiner stepping into the middle fifth realm.

However, a Qi Refiner remaining awake for seven years, perpetually caught in overthinking, was rare and would naturally harm their spirit. 

Thus, despite having a realm, their mind gradually withered.

Chen Ping’an smiled and asked, “Dragon Lord, I just can’t understand. Did I ever kick you in the alley or stop you from stealing bones from Li Zhen? Why are you two so intent on biting me?”

The Dragon Lord chuckled, “Though only half of the Sword Qi Great Wall remains, that old bone of Chen Qingdu is indeed a bit hard to chew. You've endured all these years, and it’s something to be proud of.”

Chen Ping’an shifted his gaze and said to Liu Bai, “Aren’t you leaving? Even if I pity you, there’s a limit.”

Liu Bai’s gaze hardened, “Today, when we part, it might well be a farewell of life and death. So you might as well say more; after all, when I confront my inner demon, it won’t truly be the Chen Ping’an anymore.”

Chen Ping’an waved his hand, “I advise you to take the hint and leave quickly, while I’m still in a good mood.”

Liu Bai stood firm, her figure unwavering.

The Dragon Lord mocked, “Just by comprehending a shallow view of the white bones, to wash away your heart’s resentment, and your mood improves a little? Zen flavor cannot be clung to; still waters do not hide dragons. Zen meditation is not about being still at set times; you are still far from it. Let’s be frank, the white bone view for you is genuinely a side door; no matter how long you comprehend it, you won’t achieve anything. Even if you see yourself transform into the purest white bone, your thoughts collapse, from broken to complete, from white bones to flesh, eventually glowing and shimmering, yet your spirit remains outwardly focused, your mind filled with nothing but a mix of white bones—what a pity that it ultimately does not align with your path. Is it just that the book says those who died wrongfully at Qingtong Lake are merely white bones?”

At this point, the Dragon Lord glanced at Chen Ping’an, gently shaking his head in disbelief, “If you want to deceive yourself, scattering countless thoughts on top of the white bones to force yourself to rest for a moment, you should obediently hide away and not come here seeking humiliation.”

In truth, Chen Ping’an would never go too far down the path of the white bone view. As the Dragon Lord stated, it was merely a clever method to temporarily take a “little nap.” Therefore, even if Chen Ping’an did not come today, the Dragon Lord would still have made his point, never allowing him the slightest opportunity for soul nourishment.

Chen Ping’an slightly furrowed his brow before breaking into a casual smile, holding his sword and pointing it at the blurry old man within the gray robe, “Dragon Lord, you have such profound laws; how can I thank you for guiding me to avoid going astray? Your years of hard work in safeguarding the path have truly fortified my resolve. If it weren’t for your appearance, I might have mistaken you for the left protector from my hometown, Qilong Alley.”

The Dragon Lord laughed, “When one is about to die, their words are kind. You, on the other hand, act contrary to that.”

Chen Ping’an turned his head again, curious, “You’re really not leaving? Do you truly believe standing still and looking at me is sharpening your path and sword intent?”

Liu Bai glanced at that young man and couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy, “You’re truly pitiful.”

Chen Ping’an squinted and smiled.

The Dragon Lord suddenly unleashed a surge of sword qi, cutting off the connection between heaven and earth, preventing Chen Ping’an’s words from reaching Liu Bai’s ears, even blocking her from getting another glance at him.

With the Dragon Lord’s sword qi suppression gone, the mountain-water barrier that concealed the half-completed Sword Qi Great Wall closed once more.

Liu Bai found her vision blurred, unable to see anything on the other side. She was stunned for a moment, “Dragon Lord, why is this?”

The Dragon Lord replied, “You only need to understand one thing: his earlier suggestion for you to take the hint was correct. Moreover, his statement was a setup for the final line; otherwise, if he spoke, and you heard it, it could cause your inner demon to surge.”

Liu Bai shook her head, “I don’t believe that!”

The figure of the old man, composed of intertwining sword qi, gradually dissipated, transforming back into an empty gray robe. The Dragon Lord earnestly said, “Enough. There’s no need to lower yourself to the level of a mad dog. Practice your sword well in the future. If you can truly cut down the inner demon manifested by that person, it will greatly benefit you. Through calamity comes fortune; your path may very well surpass what it was before.”

Though Liu Bai did not fully understand the implications, she was filled with curiosity about Chen Ping’an's words. Yet, she would not defy the Dragon Lord’s teachings and dared not treat her sword path lightly by engaging in a pointless rivalry with Chen Ping’an. She promptly mounted her sword and left the city wall.

After Liu Bai departed, Li Zhen, who had been standing not far away, approached the Dragon Lord.

Li Zhen complained, “You treat that little girl Liu Bai much better than you do me.”

The Dragon Lord merely turned to gaze at the remnants of the northern city.

A thousand years ago, the convict who had moved here with a guilty conscience; everything came from nothing.

Li Zhen asked, “Why are you so hostile toward Chen Ping’an?”

The Dragon Lord replied indifferently, “What enmity could a young man have with me? It’s just that anyone who wishes to become the second Chen Qingdu must die.”

Li Zhen then asked, “Although I am not Guan Zhao, I know that Guan Zhao is merely disappointment. Why are you so?”

The mentality of Guan Zhao is somewhat akin to that of the old blind man among the ten thousand mountains; sword immortals like Zhang Lu are likely the same. They share the same mentality toward the new and old worlds of the vast realm.

The Dragon Lord withdrew his gaze, remaining silent.

Li Zhen asked, “Has our Hidden Official truly not reached the Nascent Soul realm yet and is still a broken Golden Core?”

The Dragon Lord couldn’t be bothered to respond.

Li Zhen muttered to himself, “It’s not surprising that Liu Bai genuinely feels pity for him.”

The world was desolate, and alone, how could the sunlight and moonlight not be far behind?

Occasionally, birds flew toward the city wall, swiftly passing through the mountain-water formation. If the sun and moon were unseen, there would be no distinction of day and night, let alone the change of seasons.

Reborn, spirit condensed, with a body outside the body, this is the Yang Spirit, which delights in light; it is the best dwelling place for the Golden Core. 

A single spark of spirit, emerging from obscurity and entering the nether, is the Yin Spirit, which delights in nocturnal wanderings; it is the place for the Nascent Soul to cultivate during waking and sleeping.

Chen Ping’an’s resonance with the Sword Qi Great Wall came at a great cost.

The three had long since fused into one; otherwise, he could not bear the weight of that great demon’s true name, nor could he truly resonate with the Sword Qi Great Wall. From now on, the young hidden official would be destined to have no more opportunities for his Yin Spirit to venture out, and as for the Confucian sage’s life-bound character, that was utterly impossible.

Li Zhen laughed, “Liu Bai may be a bit foolish, but a little foolishness is good; her future inner demon won’t be too tightly knotted and unsolvable.”

The Dragon Lord decisively severing the connection to the world was equivalent to saving Liu Bai’s life.

Otherwise, that hidden official only needed to say a single word to potentially cost Liu Bai half her life.

It was simple; a single “Why do you like me?” could lead to Liu Bai’s heart collapsing significantly.

As to whether Liu Bai truly liked him, it mattered not; that was precisely the most troublesome point.

After all, disliking someone in this world is merely inconsequential, but liking someone can take on a thousand forms, with countless reasons.

The Dragon Lord suddenly isolated a small realm that was not easy to notice with sword qi, asking, “What exactly did you see?”

Li Zhen countered, “What are you talking about?”

The Dragon Lord said gravely, “Your life-bound flying sword is called ‘Time’.”

Li Zhen smiled, “So what? Are you not clearer than anyone else that I am probably the most idle sword cultivator in the world, at least one of them? With my current level, what can I see, and what can I do?”

Li Zhen shook his head to himself, self-mockingly declaring, “I haven’t seen anything; I haven’t done anything.”

The reason Li Zhen was reluctant to become Guan Zhao stemmed from that life-bound flying sword, which resembled a grand prison of heaven and earth.

In the past, many young sword cultivators had surrounded and killed Chen Ping’an, and afterward, Zhu Ke had noticed Li Zhen’s dispirited state and personally advised him. Given his current mindset, he might not achieve even as much as Liu Bai in a hundred years. Zhu Ke also inquired of Li Zhen, who earnestly sought “to distance himself from the true self of Guan Zhao,” whether he could genuinely cultivate as a sword cultivator, truly wielding a sword. At that time, Li Zhen’s response was rather strange, inquiring back whether Zhu Ke had ever walked through the river of time, ultimately providing the concepts of “riverbed” and “fate.”

The top sword immortal, Chen Qingdu, had once expressed a sentiment after encountering a “former friend” that if he could flow upstream in the river of time for ten thousand years, returning to the battlefield, he could ask swords from any “elder.”

Li Zhen looked toward the other side, murmuring, “I really envy you.”

And that young hidden official, whom Li Zhen envied, carried the sword Zhan Kan at his waist, slowly throwing punches atop the city wall.

Just like back then, he left alone, throwing punches; at that time, there were two small thatched cottages atop the Sword Qi Great Wall, where the old sword immortal still remained, and even Cao Ci, who had defeated him three times, was present.

Compared to Chen Ping’an, whose thoughts were constantly swirling, the passage of time felt unbearably slow. Each punch seemed to be a journey back and forth between the mountain's summit and foot, digging a handful of soil, ultimately moving mountains.

On the opposing half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, every time a great cultivator of the human race was slain by the Wild world, a large character would be inscribed on the city wall. Moreover, it seemed the Jiazi banner had changed its mind; there was no need to kill a single ascendant; even a celestial being or a certain sect master would suffice. Characters would be inscribed not only for the names of great demons but also for those they had slain.

Due to the tremendous commotion caused by the demon’s inscription, especially regarding the circulation of heaven and earth’s fortune, even across a mountain-water great formation, Chen Ping’an, who occupied half the Sword Qi Great Wall, could faintly perceive the unusualness over there. Occasionally throwing a punch or a blade to break the great formation was not a mere trivial act.

The Sword Immortal Gu Xia’s master, one of the ten in the Central Earth Divine Continent, Zhou Shen Zhi.

A celestial being from Fu Yao Continent. In addition, the old Heavenly Lord of Tai Ping Mountain in Tongye Continent, the mountain lord of Tai Ping Mountain, and the sect leader of Fu Ji Sect, Ji Hai. Among the three scholars of the academy, there was also the master of Jun Zi, the mountain lord of Da Fu Academy...

All had perished.

Fortunately, Chen Chun’an from Nan Po Sha Continent had not been present, nor had his seniors.

Xun Yuan from Yu Gui Sect in Tongye Continent and Jiang Shangzhen were also unharmed.

Through these events, Chen Ping’an could roughly gauge the advancement speed of the demon clan within the vast realm.

It was originally meaningless, only adding to his troubles.

However, after obtaining that volume of “Mountain and Water Travels,” once Chen Ping’an refined all the texts contained within, receiving the secret letter from the Grand Li National Master, it became critically important.

Then, a feeling arose within Chen Ping’an that this Cui Zhan, if he weren’t crazy, would never think of such a way to send a message.

The true brilliance of Cui Zhan lay not in betting that Chen Ping’an would piece together this secret letter, but in confidently assuring that the old fox who claimed to be a bookworm, Zhou Mi, would learn of this secret letter after him! What was particularly terrifying was that it seemed to Cui Zhan that whether Zhou Mi knew about this matter made no difference to the larger scheme he had in mind. If Zhou Mi was completely unaware, that would be best. Yet even if Zhou Mi became aware, it would not impact the overall plan.

But there were several larger and smaller meanings hidden within, making Chen Ping’an regret that his mind was as deranged as Cui Zhan’s, having accidentally pieced together this secret letter.

Knowing was worse than not knowing.

At the old site of the Da Fu Academy in Tongye Continent, a large demon in the guise of a scholar in a blue robe twitched slightly, immediately sending someone to retrieve a volume of “Mountain and Water Travels.” After refining all the texts, he pondered briefly before successively refining the characters of Cui, Zhan, and the five others. He tried all combinations and ultimately found the eight-character secret letter in his heart’s lake: “The timing is right, the mountains and waters are reversed.”

Zhou Mi chuckled, calling out to Cui Zhan with his heart voice, then extending his hand, “Please, Cui Guoshi, let’s chat for a bit.”

The other party was merely a public plan, betting on whether Baoping Continent could determine the trends of the world.

If Baoping Continent could hold its ground, the so-called reversal of mountains and waters would hold meaning; after all, the remaining half of the Sword Qi Great Wall still belonged to the territory of the vast realm. If they could not hold it, Cui Zhan would merely be trading one life for another, saving at most a young person, and it would also depend on whether that person was willing to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall and switch places with him, Cui Zhan. The most interesting part was that Zhou Mi dared to assert that if Chen Ping’an truly sought assistance from Cui Zhan, who had a fallen Baoping Continent, he would likely be incredibly disappointed, ignored by Cui Zhan; that would truly be a most intriguing inquiry of the heart.

Cui Zhan slowly materialized before Zhou Mi.

Zhou Mi asked, “So-called ‘the timing is right,’ is that when Baoping Continent successfully halts the Wild world’s northern advance, and ultimately, the two realms are at a stalemate?”

The old Confucian scholar, who had descended in the Da Fu Academy of Tongye Continent, nodded with a smile.

It was indeed the Grand Li National Master, Cui Zhan.

If Zhou Mi were not at the academy ruins, Cui Zhan naturally would not appear.

Zhou Mi then asked, “Cui Guoshi is so certain that Chen Ping’an has already received the secret letter first, and is also certain Baoping Continent will hold its ground, and also certain Chen Ping’an can hold out until that day? Especially needing to be sure that Chen Ping’an can endure the worries of life and death, so as not to change places with you too early, thus ruining your previous efforts?”

Cui Zhan said, “As a disciple of the Sage of Literature, I at least have this bit of brains and responsibility.”

Zhou Mi smiled and asked, “Cui Guoshi, I only have one final question: how can you be sure that half of the Sword Qi Great Wall can hold until you say the timing is right? Are you not worried I might step in personally to target him?”

Cui Zhan replied indifferently, “Between you and me, we contend not only for the trends of two realms. If you lack this bit of courage, you are not qualified to discuss reestablishing the Confucian path, gathering the literary veins, and establishing teachings to honor your ancestors.”

Zhou Mi fell silent for a moment, shaking his head with a sigh, “Cui Zhan, so you intend to use the life of Chen Ping’an and the half of the Sword Qi Great Wall as bait in exchange for the life of the Li Sheng... No, rather, the second sage in exchange for mine?”

Cui Zhan smiled, “It could also be the Sage of Literature himself making a move.”

Zhou Mi laughed, “That is something one could only dream of.”

Cui Zhan said, “Quickly have that Tuo Yue Mountain ancestor break the heavens’ curtain; I want to see what kind of ancient gods, hindered by the Li Sheng, can stir up on my Baoping Continent.”

Zhou Mi nodded, “As you wish.”

Then the two almost simultaneously looked toward the direction of Fu Yao Continent, Zhou Mi chuckling, “Why provoke him?”

The old blind man in the ten thousand mountains of the Wild World had long since stated that he would remain an observer.

The Daoist in Donghai Guan Dao Temple, that foul-nosed figure, had chosen to stay out of it. He even aided a bit before his ascension from the Dao Temple.

That old monk was temporarily uncertain of his whereabouts, but most likely, he had already arrived at Baoping Continent; this was still within Tuo Yue Mountain’s expectations.

The only one who, according to previous calculations, was hailed as the most accomplished scholar of the Central Earth Divine Continent, upon reaching the fifth realm, would remain there, returning the sword to the Xuan Du Temple of Qing Ming Continent.

He should not have returned to the vast realm with the sword.

Unexpectedly, this person had indeed drawn his sword.

As a cultivator of the Fourteen Realms, the scholar Bai Ye, wielding a celestial sword, appeared in the southwestern Fu Yao Continent, which could already be considered part of the Wild World’s territory. He consecutively unleashed three strikes, one sending his opponent flying out of Fu Yao Continent, one crossing the sea, and the last landing near the old site of the Upside-Down Mountain, slaying a lord-level demon.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 828: Contending for the World with a Single City (Part 1)**

In the spring of the seventh year of the Jiachun era, the Zushi Hall of Ascension City held its second official meeting, which was mandatory for all direct disciples to attend. Everyone who had established a residence outside or was traveling as a sword cultivator was required to return on time.

It had been six years since the first time offerings were made to the ancestral portraits.

In the grand hall of the Zushi Hall, forty-one chairs were arranged. Two chairs remained vacant beside the table beneath the ancestral portraits. On the left sat the representatives of the Justice Enforcer lineage, while the Hidden Officials and Wealth Store lineage occupied the right side. There was a subtle air of confrontation between the two sides.

The leader of the Justice Enforcer lineage, Qi Shou, had recently entered the Jade Purity realm. Below him sat two elder Yuan Ying sword cultivators, each hailing from small families on Tai Xiang Street and Yu Hu Street, which were once vassals of the Chen and Nalan clans, respectively. Their relationship with Qi Shou was lukewarm at best. Both elders were well past their prime, with only a century of life left, so they had taken a greater interest in helping Ascension City flourish, eager to impart their sword techniques to the younger generation.

This scenario resembled the political landscape of mundane dynasties, where soon-to-retire elders often became more forthright, willing to say and do things they previously would not have dared. 

Now, with Ascension City undergoing a rejuvenation, sword cultivators practiced freely, without the constraints of old sectarian biases. The Hidden Officials lineage had previously sifted through archives and organized secret records, unveiling many locked-away sword manuals and techniques left by ancient sword immortals. 

Yet, on the path of cultivation, there remained a principle that teachings should not be shared lightly, and methods should not be handed out indiscriminately. Thus, young sword cultivators had to rely on their innate talents, achievements, and the quality of their destined flying swords, particularly the essence of their flying sword techniques, before they could access various secret archives and manuals after being assessed by both the Justice Enforcer and Hidden Officials lineages. While there were still barriers to entry, they were significantly lower compared to the past.

Moreover, the Hidden Officials lineage had also released an improved method for cultivating the Eighteen Stops of Sword Energy, available to all sword cultivators in Ascension City. It was said that this new method was originally passed down from A Liang and was cultivated by a select few young talents, including Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, and Die Zhang. 

One by one, sword cultivators entered and took their seats. The vast majority were young faces, and indeed, they were genuinely youthful. Among them, the least experienced were all at least at the Dragon Gate level, with a few exceptional prodigies yet to reach their twenties, rumored to be potential candidates from the Hidden Officials lineage. 

In the Zushi Hall of Ascension City, there were too few elders and too many young people, a sight unseen in any other ancestral hall of the vast world. 

As the appointed time approached, there was still about the time it takes to burn an incense stick left. Qi Shou had taken his seat and was engaged in discussion with an elder Yuan Ying sword cultivator next to him. Currently, the Justice Enforcer lineage wielded the most power within Ascension City, with endless tasks to attend to. Qi Shou personally oversaw the selection of sites, placement of critical materials, and the establishment of formation arrays on the eight surrounding mountains, showcasing his exceptional talent as he ascended through the ranks amid such busy times. 

Over the years, Qi Shou had not merely focused on sword training, relentlessly pursuing the Jade Purity realm. Instead, he had tirelessly dedicated himself to the affairs of Ascension City, which earned him substantial goodwill among the populace. 

With Ning Yao yet to appear, the atmosphere in the Zushi Hall remained relatively relaxed. Everyone understood that Ning Yao alone could command half of the hall's influence. 

Guo Zhujiu casually rested her walking staff across the armrests of her chair, lightly swinging her legs. Beside her sat an elder maiden and a fair-minded individual. 

Gu Jianlong voiced his thoughts, “Lv Duan, why hasn’t Ning Yao ascended to the Ascension realm yet? Honestly, I’m a bit disappointed.” 

The way to address Ning Yao had become a significant dilemma for the former Hidden Officials lineage. Calling her “Lord Hidden Official” felt inappropriate, while addressing her by name seemed too familiar, given that she was a bona fide sword immortal. Yet calling her “Sword Immortal Ning” felt overly formal. Fortunately, Ning Yao had previously opened the conversation by mentioning her name, so now no one was shy about it. After all, the Hidden Officials lineage was not known for their politeness. 

Guo Zhujiu lightly tapped her green bamboo staff, echoing in thought, “What do you know? It’s just the matriarch showing face for the Justice Enforcer sword cultivators.” 

Dong Buduo suddenly slapped Guo Zhujiu on the back of her head. 

Guo Zhujiu raised her hands defensively, her shoulders shaking as if she had dispersed Dong Buduo’s “punching intent.” Annoyed, she exclaimed, “Sister Dong, what’s the deal? I haven’t said anything bad about you, I swear!” 

Dong Buduo twirled a frost jade book seal between her fingers, smiling, “Just itching to do something.” 

Guo Zhujiu muttered under her breath, “With Master Hidden Official not here, and Mistress Hidden Official yet to arrive, you’re really taking the opportunity to bully me.” 

Wang Xinshui suddenly asked, “What about Sword Immortal Mi, and our good brothers Cao Gun and Xuan Can? Do they still count as sword cultivators under the Hidden Officials lineage?” 

Gu Jianlong rolled his eyes, “Are you being silly? What’s so hard about moving a few chairs? Our own family records still have their names, right?” 

Wang Xinshui nodded, “You’re right.” 

In the early days of the former Hidden Officials lineage, Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, Cao Gun, and Xuan Can had formed a brotherhood, viewing each other as comrades. They had been dubbed the "Four Lackeys under the Hidden Official" by Dong Buduo, with their combined strength equivalent to a single Guo Zhujiu. 

Luo Zhenyi felt a pang of melancholy. 

In the current Ascension City, she felt somewhat like Song Caiyun, Zhou Cheng, and Nalan Caihuan from the former Sword Energy Great Wall—not only was she naturally beautiful, but she was also destined to become a female sword immortal. 

Back when the former Hidden Officials lineage was still active, Sword Immortal Chou Miao was around, and the young outsiders like Lin Junbi and Song Gaoyuan were present. 

Simply watching Lin Junbi and Cao Gun or Xuan Can play chess, with piles of discarded pieces behind them, each one relishing their role as the military strategist, hadn’t seemed particularly interesting at the time. Looking back now, Luo Zhenyi realized it had been quite amusing. 

One young man, standing with his hands tucked inside his sleeves, had little skill in chess but loved to point out moves, seemingly eager to stir chaos. 

If Cao Gun or Xuan Can managed to win against Lin Junbi, Guo Zhujiu would lead the four lackeys in boasting about it. If they lost, that young man would confidently throw out, “What, is it my fault?” 

Fan Dache took his seat, his expression solemn and quiet. He was the most composed of the Hidden Officials sword cultivators but also the most sentimental. 

The girl he liked had already married, and when they had met by chance on the street, her child had called him “Uncle Fan.” For reasons he couldn’t explain, he had felt a bit sad then, but now he found he wasn’t heartbroken. Looking at the child, who bore her resemblance, Fan Dache only knew he smiled at that moment, unaware of how his smile appeared to the woman who had become a wife and mother. 

His best friend, Chen Sanqiu, had gone to the vast world. 

The young Hidden Official he trusted the most remained behind at the Sword Energy Great Wall. 

He missed that call of “Dache!” 

Fan Dache quietly turned to glance behind him, a self-deprecating smile forming on his lips before he quickly withdrew his gaze, focusing again on cultivating his sword intent in silence. 

He knew his swordsmanship wasn’t on par with any sword cultivator in the Hidden Officials lineage; he had stumbled his way into the Golden Core realm through numerous hardships. In contrast, Guo Zhujiu and Gu Jianlong possessed exceptional innate talent and far surpassed him with their efforts. Thus, Fan Dache felt considerable pressure. 

As the second-in-command of the Justice Enforcer lineage, Nian Xin rarely made appearances. Typically clad in a loose robe, she was at the Yuan Ying realm but wasn’t a sword cultivator. 

Her true identity seemed to be somewhat of a mystery, even to the former Hidden Officials lineage. She had emerged in Ascension City and inexplicably become a significant figure within the Justice Enforcer lineage. 

She was one of the latest four eccentricities of Ascension City. 

Nian Xin’s chair was located behind the Justice Enforcers and the two elder Yuan Ying sword cultivators. 

However, like Ning Yao, Nian Xin had yet to show herself. 

Three chairs to the south of Nian Xin sat another one of the four eccentricities, a trio of Golden Core sword cultivators, with the lone male dressed in women’s attire. 

They hailed from the private abode of the sword immortal “Bapi Zhai,” which had once been adjacent to the Zongyu Immortal Pavilion. With the magical techniques passed down from their master, the three were now tasked with helping Ascension City find young sword cultivators. 

In truth, they were more than willing to be sword cultivators of the Hidden Officials lineage, but they had yet to receive Ning Yao's approval, who was currently posing as the acting Hidden Official. 

The elder sword immortal from Bapi Zhai had a close friendship with A Liang and possessed numerous ancient inkstones. Thus, Xuezhu, Shuiyu, and Guanzhen, all relatively low in cultivation but notably powerful in combat, were quite familiar with Guo Zhujiu, who had a penchant for sneaking around as a child. 

Consequently, while the Zushi Hall appeared to be factionally divided, the interconnections among them were intricate, whether through friendship, familial ties, or shared history. 

A woman entered quietly through the main door and took her seat without greeting anyone or even exchanging glances. 

It was Nian Xin. 

Nian Xin began to meditate with her eyes closed, determined not to speak during today’s meeting. 

Currently, for a sword cultivator to become a member of the Justice Enforcer lineage in Ascension City, only those from the sword cultivator class among the Qi practitioners had this qualification—a strict rule for Ascension City. 

In contrast, the Hidden Officials and Wealth Store lineages had no such restrictions; practitioners from various schools could freely join. 

For those who were not Qi practitioners seeking to join the Justice Enforcers, they could only do so by being pure martial artists from the former Hidden Officials lineage. 

The former Hidden Officials' martial artist lineage had hired Zheng Dafu, a tavern owner, as their boxing instructor. 

However, Zheng Dafu had declined the offer to serve Ascension City, instead teaching boxing to the group of young swordsmen led by Jiang Yun while only accepting a salary. 

Now, the number of martial artists under the Justice Enforcers had surged to over sixty. Excluding the ten who had been taught boxing by Bai Lianshuang and the two children Nian Xin had recently taken in, the rest were mostly five or six-year-old children. 

While martial arts had far lower requirements for aptitude than sword cultivation, it was still generally accepted that one should start training early. 

Thus, the Justice Enforcers had unconsciously formed a three-headed pattern among their ranks. 

With Qi Shou holding power, Nian Xin responsible for nurturing martial artists, and the two elder Yuan Ying sword cultivators collaborating well with the trio from Bapi Zhai, who were teaching sword techniques and searching for sword cultivators, everything flowed smoothly. 

Yet even so, Qi Shou, who oversaw nearly half of the sword cultivators, was still the undisputed power in Ascension City. 

After discussing matters with the elder sword cultivator next to him, Qi Shou returned to his seat and glanced at the chair opposite him. 

Across from him sat the Hidden Officials lineage, led by Ning Yao, along with Dong Buduo, Xu Ning, Luo Zhenyi, Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, Chang Taiqing, Guo Zhujiu, and Fan Dache. 

There were a total of nine individuals. 

In contrast to the mountain-like presence of the Justice Enforcers, the Hidden Officials lineage had fewer members, and the camaraderie among them was evidently stronger, far beyond what the Justice Enforcers could rival. 

Upon Ning Yao’s second return from her travels, Qi Shou had noticed she was clearly at the bottleneck of the Immortal realm, genuinely a great sword immortal. 

Yet from the perspective of all the sword cultivators in Ascension City, it was surprising that Ning Yao had returned home without breaking through. 

This illustrated Ning Yao's standing in Ascension City. 

Becoming a sword immortal was difficult, becoming a great sword immortal even more so, but achieving the Ascension realm was akin to reaching for the heavens. 

However, Ning Yao was the only exception. 

Qi Shou felt no resentment about this, knowing that Ascension City truly needed such a presence. 

After all, in this world, many forces vied for control, and Ascension City was not the only power. 

While the path of swordsmanship might be destined to fall short compared to Ning Yao, Qi Shou had an entire world to contend with. 

Qi Shou’s gaze shifted slightly. 

The chair belonging to the Marquis of Gaoye was positioned beside Ning Yao. 

This individual had arrived at the Zushi Hall earlier than Qi Shou. 

Currently, the Marquis of Gaoye remained at the Yuan Ying realm; breaking into Jade Purity would not come in just three to five years. A slow step could lead to many slow steps, and Qi Shou did not regard him as a rival and was even willing to befriend him like Deng Liang. 

The Wealth Store, overseeing the financial power of Ascension City, was unified under the leadership of the Yuan Ying sword cultivator, the Marquis of Gaoye. However, as the God of Wealth, he was not particularly skilled in financial matters; the actual management was handled by several sword cultivators promoted from the Yan and Nalan families—older but not particularly high in cultivation, making them the most suitable for bookkeeping. 

The name “Wealth Store” was clearly the work of the young Hidden Official; otherwise, it wouldn’t sound so refined. 

Qi Shou had once fought alongside Chen Pingan atop the city walls. 

Their public and private matters were clear. On the battlefield, they were more than just friends; Chen Pingan had even engaged in a significant transaction with Qi Shou. 

However, outside of the battlefield, they each had their own ways of making things difficult for each other, but it never reached the point of life and death. 

Deep down, Qi Shou had to admit that if that fellow had come to this world with them, he would undoubtedly feel constrained in every way, but it might also spark within him a greater fighting spirit. 

Moreover, aside from the deep roots of the Qi family, their ancestor, Qi Tingji, remained the only old sword immortal still at the pinnacle of the sword path. 

Even though Qi Tingji was now in the vast world, continuing to wield his sword against demons, he still posed a significant deterrent to the present Ascension City. 

Deng Liang's position was near the entrance, sitting alongside the younger, talented children. 

This arrangement was somewhat out of the ordinary; as the first named offering in Ascension City, his seat should ideally be near the Marquis of Gaoye and Nian Xin. 

It was Deng Liang’s insistence on this arrangement. 

This also made Deng Liang’s already good rapport in Ascension City even better. 

He hailed from the prominent sect of Jiudu Mountain in the Aiai Continent, a direct descendant and a Yuan Ying sword cultivator, and upon returning home, he had secretly achieved a green status as a scholar within the examination system, a feat more challenging than becoming a direct disciple of the Zushi Hall. 

Once a scholar of Jiudu Mountain achieved a green status, the cultivator could share in a portion of the sect’s fortunes. 

Deng Liang was of the former Hidden Officials lineage but maintained a close relationship with Qi Shou, the leader of the Justice Enforcers. 

Thus, Deng Liang chose not to align entirely with either side, wisely maintaining a degree of distance from the Hidden Officials lineage. 

Deng Liang had three main goals for this trip: to break through his sword cultivation, to seek out the great sword immortal he admired, and to serve as a bridge between Ascension City and Jiudu Mountain. 

Deng Liang hoped to contribute to Ascension City while also minimizing the hostility between the sword cultivators of the Justice Enforcers and the Hidden Officials lineage. 

Therefore, his position needed to be neutral, allowing the words spoken as a named offering to resonate with the sword cultivators of Ascension City. 

During this visit to Ascension City, he brought a substantial amount of unique sect supplies, including the most favored New Year wine from the local lord and precious “Zhongsi Rice” along with “Quegui Talismans.” Deng Liang had also carried a special item and a compact item from his sect, containing ample spiritual energy, consisting of sixty vats of celestial wine and eight hundred jin of “Zhongsi Rice,” which resembled pomegranate seeds, bright red in color, with a flavor akin to water chestnuts. 

It was the perfect tonic for martial artists in the lower five realms, mild in nature and highly nutritious for the cultivators on the mountain. 

Especially valuable were the three hundred Quegui Talismans, which were extraordinarily rare in the Aiai Continent, known as “Green Muscle Gold Charms.” The charm paper was made from a unique celestial leaf exclusive to Jiudu Mountain, which gleamed golden under sunlight or moonlight, akin to an entity protecting one’s home when affixed. 

Deng Liang gifted all of these to the Wealth Store. 

Ning Yao appeared at the entrance. 

Whispers around the Zushi Hall abruptly ceased. 

Throughout the years, Ning Yao had balanced breaking through and traveling extensively. 

No one understood this world better than her. 

Ning Yao did not take a seat but instead went to offer incense to the ancestral portraits of Ascension City. 

Qi Shou of the Justice Enforcers and the Marquis of Gaoye followed closely behind. 

The nine incense sticks offered by the three would be presented by the oldest elder in the Zushi Hall. 

This was the first formal meeting of the Zushi Hall, and a new rule was established by Ning Yao, with no one dissenting. 

The elder sword cultivator from the Justice Enforcer lineage was the one to present the incense today, and it was his first time doing so for the three, causing him to become somewhat emotional. 

Previously, this place would host a few meetings each year, but since Ning Yao had always been away, her absence from offering incense meant the meetings could not officially be considered gatherings of Ascension City. 

Moreover, prior meetings had often seen half the chairs in the Zushi Hall empty. The elder sword cultivator had never shown such sentiment when presenting incense to Qi Shou and the Marquis of Gaoye in the past. 

After the three offered their incense, everyone else in the Zushi Hall stood up. 

Once Ning Yao took her seat, she remained silent. 

Qi Shou announced, “Let the meeting commence.” 

This grand gathering of the Zushi Hall had raised concerns among the Justice Enforcer lineage, even among the two elder Yuan Ying sword cultivators and the three Golden Cores from Xuezhu. They feared the possibility of the Zushi Hall becoming a one-man show from this day forward. 

These worries were not solely based on self-interest. 

It was common knowledge that Ning Yao had once returned to Ascension City and cut Qi Shou down with a single sword strike. 

So, would future instances of the Hidden Officials lineage feeling “aggrieved,” regardless of reason, result in Ning Yao simply using her sword to settle matters? 

No one doubted Ning Yao’s role as the leader of the city, nor did they think she would abuse her power; the reasoning was far too simple. There was no need for her to concern herself with such authority. Ning Yao held no interest in these so-called powers. 

For her, with her sights set on the magnificent landscape of the Ascension realm, even Qi Shou and the Marquis of Gaoye understood that to become the foremost sect in the Fifth World, Ascension City could do without anyone except Ning Yao. 

However, to firmly establish itself within the Fifth World, Ascension City ultimately could not rely solely on Ning Yao’s cultivation and swordsmanship to resolve all matters. 

Thus, a group of elder sword cultivators had secretly convened before this meeting, expressing a desire for Ning Yao to detach from the Hidden Officials lineage entirely, to become an existence above it all—or more directly, to become a second Chen Qingdu. 

Let all major decisions be made by her, but for the daily affairs and trivial matters of Ascension City, it would be best if Ning Yao refrained from intervening, allowing her to focus solely on her sword training, ultimately rising to become the first Ascension realm sword immortal in this world! 

Deng Liang, the offering, was fully aware of the general sentiments among the three lineages in Ascension City. 

After all, as an offering from Jiudu Mountain, one of the significant sects in the vast world, and having spent many years as a wild cultivator, Deng Liang didn’t view these mixed feelings as necessarily negative. 

In fact, he felt that currently, Ascension City, if not considering combat strength, was even more vibrant than the Sword Energy Great Wall of old. 

Tai Xiang Street and Yu Hu Street were still within the city, yet there were no longer any genuinely prominent families or sword immortal heads. 

There were hardly any elders left. 

After all, most sword immortals had fallen in distant battles. 

It seemed that during that war, the greater sword immortals had intentionally pressured all sword immortals and elders to clear a path for the younger generation. 

Though this place was now a foreign land, it would one day become the home of an increasing number of young people and children from Ascension City. 

Qi Shou was the first to speak, summarizing and filtering all news regarding celestial forces, especially focusing on those sects with “sect” in their name, such as Bai Yujing in the far east, Xuandu Guan, and Suichu Palace. 

Another priority was to gather intelligence on all talented cultivators who had reached the Jade Purity realm. For instance, the female Daoist Huang Ting from Tongye Continent had already achieved the Jade Purity realm and had erected a stone monument at a mountain peak, inscribing “Taiping Mountain.” 

Additionally, there was a man using the alias Yang Hengxing, a formidable figure who was both a martial artist in the Wandering realm and a Yuan Ying cultivator, not to be underestimated. 

Besides Ning Yao who had traveled alone, four sword cultivators from the Justice Enforcers were dispatched in various directions to gather information. They also collected a wealth of reports from Fuyou Continent and Tongye Continent. 

Qi Shou proposed, “We should compile two records according to the old practices of the former Hidden Officials lineage—one documenting all sect forces and the other recording those at the upper five realms and Earth Immortal cultivators. What do you think?” 

Ning Yao nodded. 

The Marquis of Gaoye added, “No objections here.” 

After six years of continuous expansion, due to Ascension City’s central location, it began to interact more frequently with the outside world. 

Sword cultivators ventured further afield, and others began to visit in droves. 

Aside from the visible growth and orderliness of Ascension City, many matters from other families gradually surfaced. 

Among the young ten, Bai Yujing’s Daoist Shan Qing was a disciple of the Daoist Patriarch. A young monk wielding a twelve-ringed staff was traveling alone. 

Among the candidates, there was also the Tian Yu from Liuxia Continent, who had already established an extraordinary platform. 

Furthermore, there were several Jade Purity realm cultivators in this world, including a female disciple from the Sword Immortal lineage of the Xuandu Guan in the Qingming world. 

The Hidden Officials lineage, after all, had established old practices to follow, proceeding step by step. In fact, the former Hidden Officials lineage had long devised a detailed scheme. 

Previously, the Hidden Officials lineage had dispersed across the city to survey its mountains and rivers. The Justice Enforcers subsequently selected eight spiritually potent locations to expand the territory of Ascension City, delineating a vast new realm as the foundation for its future endeavors. 

The former Hidden Officials lineage had left behind a comprehensive book, written by the young Hidden Officials and collaboratively compiled by all the foreign sword cultivators, including Lin Junbi and Song Gaoyuan. 

This book was divided into several sections, including the Structure Chapter, detailing the operations of sects like the Pima Sect in Beijulu Continent, Chunlu Garden, Taiping Mountain in Tongye Continent, and the Deer Horn Palace where Song Gaoyuan resided, along with the Hall of Worship and battlefields of the Shao Yuan Dynasty. 

The External Expansion Chapter discussed how to establish celestial residences, arrange formations, insert spies, and detailed the customs and practices of various sects, further subdivided into twelve major topics. 

The People’s Heart Chapter included methods for establishing educational institutions and related considerations. 

The Mountain and Water Chapter specifically detailed the various sacred mountains and water spirits throughout the vast world. 

This extensive book, totaling over a hundred thousand words, was distributed to all members of the Zushi Hall, except for the deleted People's Heart Chapter, ensuring that everyone was somewhat familiar with the intricate rules of the vast world, if not entirely knowledgeable. 

“Justice Enforcer, I have something to say.” 

Gu Jianlong suddenly stood up, smiling, “Among the fourteen sword cultivators of the Justice Enforcers, those heading south and north have clashed significantly with cultivators from Tongye Continent and Fuyou Continent, and I’ve heard they’ve even killed some. Upon returning to Ascension City, the focus of conversation at the tables has been on how these cultivators from those two continents are worthless. Upon hearing this, I feel like it’s as if the cultivators from those two continents could be regarded as merely Observers in the Golden Core realm. If this is true, then as a mere Golden Core sword cultivator, wouldn’t I be able to run rampant in both regions?” 

Gu Jianlong added, “Of course, the individuals killed by the Justice Enforcers were all deserving of their fates; I must clarify this point. However, returning to the matter, what is deemed ‘deserving of death’ or ‘should be killed’ is merely based on the assertions of the Justice Enforcers’ roaming sword cultivators. As for the facts, whether they align with the truth requires further verification from our Hidden Officials lineage. 

If someone is indiscriminately killing outside and bringing fame to Ascension City, while their intentions may seem noble, I’d have to confront them directly to seek justice.” 

A Golden Core sword cultivator named Shuiyu from Bapi Zhai frowned slightly, “Gu Jianlong, are you overreacting?” 

Wang Xinshui countered, “Shuiyu, is there really such a thing as a small matter in this world? What major issue isn’t born from a minor one?” 

Just as Shuiyu was about to continue speaking, he was interrupted by his senior brother Xuezhu using silent communication to stop him. 

A young sword cultivator from the Justice Enforcers scoffed, “During the great war, some individuals didn’t contribute much, but now that they’re idle, they’re all too eager to attack their own. If this is the case, I think from now on, whenever we encounter outsiders, the sword cultivators of Ascension City should proactively step aside and apologize first, how about that?” 

Do you think only your Hidden Officials lineage cultivators can say such sarcastic remarks? 

Who can’t? 

Dong Buduo and Luo Zhenyi stood up almost simultaneously. 

Unexpectedly, Ning Yao glanced at that young sword cultivator. 

In an instant, both the young man and his chair flew out of the Zushi Hall. 

Then Ning Yao stated, “The meeting is concluded; it’s time for a change of personnel and a new chair.” 

That young sword cultivator fell to the ground, frightened and furious, ready to speak, but seemed to be enveloped by sword energy, turning him into a pitiful bloody figure, causing him to faint on the spot. 

Ning Yao continued, “Let’s proceed with the meeting.” 

Qi Shou maintained his composure. 

The Marquis of Gaoye remained indifferent. 

An elder Yuan Ying sword cultivator hesitated to speak. 

Deng Liang sighed softly, pondering whether that individual outside was truly speaking without thinking. 

Gu Jianlong had spoken about the matter at hand, while the one outside had targeted the entire old Hidden Officials lineage. 

Major principles, personal morals, good and evil, merits and faults, right and wrong—how complex! Once one begins to judge others rather than the matter at hand, how can one clarify any reasoning? 

Ning Yao looked at the silent crowd, who were slow to speak, and said calmly, “Those sitting here may not all be sword cultivators and may not hold high realms, but they must not be too foolish. Ascension City has only this many people; having delineated a thousand miles of territory has already made us feel stretched. Thus, engaging in the petty politics of the temple and hall below is premature. 

The only rule for discussions in the Zushi Hall is to focus on matters, not on people. If you prefer to focus on people rather than matters, then don’t occupy a seat here.” 

Ning Yao then turned to Qi Shou and asked, “Who are the recommenders and guarantors for this individual in the Justice Enforcer lineage?” 

Qi Shou provided two names. 

Two Golden Core sword cultivators immediately stood up in the Zushi Hall. 

Ning Yao turned to Xu Ning and said, “Record this matter and then check the records of that individual outside.” 

Xu Ning stood up to comply before sitting back down. 

Ning Yao gradually said, “Including the Hidden Officials lineage, from now on, everyone, including Gu Jianlong, should be mindful of their speech. Previously, during discussions in the Sword Energy Great Wall, typically only those in the Jade Purity realm could appear, while only old sword immortals could speak.” 

Gu Jianlong immediately nodded, “Understood, I will be more careful.” 

Ning Yao turned her gaze toward the entrance of the Zushi Hall and sneered, “In less than seven years, have they all grown so arrogant? After a hundred years, won’t they all be invincible?” 

The atmosphere grew intensely serious in an instant. 

Deng Liang had to stand up to explain, “If we continue to view all Qi practitioners outside Ascension City as potential enemies, then one day, Ascension City will become a desolate stronghold surrounded by adversaries. If we consider all Qi practitioners in the world as mere decorative pillows with little combat ability, we will surely suffer greatly, as other forces will exploit this to encircle us. 

Eventually, we will find ourselves fighting with others, and it won’t be about the sword but rather about unexpected encounters, leading to inevitable demise.” 

Deng Liang’s tone grew heavier, “What we think in our hearts and how we act are entirely different matters. If the sword cultivators in our Zushi Hall become arrogant, what can we expect from the outside sword cultivators? 

If we prefer to view all outsiders as lesser beings, deeming their lives insignificant, believing we can kill anyone we choose, then I think there is no need for Ascension City to strive for dominance in the world; if we can stand firm in a hundred years, we should consider it a blessing worthy of burning incense for our ancestors in the Zushi Hall. 

The Qi practitioners of the vast world, even if they are lower in realm and insufficient in combat strength, are still formidable. The bloodshed and political intrigue among them run deep, often hidden for centuries, making it all too easy to kill without a trace. My words are not alarmist rhetoric!” 

Deng Liang concluded with a fist salute, “In the other sects of the vast world, an offering ultimately remains half an outsider, and such words, which may offend everyone, should not be spoken. 

I simply cannot help but express my thoughts because the position I hold compels me to pour a bucket of cold water on everyone!” 

The Bapi Zhai sword cultivator, Shuiyu, stood up and said, “I’ve been taught.” 

The Marquis of Gaoye seldom spoke, but this time, he chimed in, “In this world, Ascension City occupies all advantages of time and place. Even if our hearts are scattered, no other force will be able to compete with us in the next hundred years. 

However, for long-term development, as Deng Liang has said, we must learn from the strengths of the Qi practitioners in the vast world to complement our own weaknesses. Only then will Ascension City possess unparalleled swordsmanship and equally adept political acumen, giving us hope to dominate this world. 

Otherwise, a hundred years later, when our shortcomings become apparent and chaos ensues, it will be too late to rectify it. Even if Ascension City maintains a majority of sword immortals, it will be of little help.” 

This was a prudent perspective. 

The sword cultivators present in the Zushi Hall felt it was only natural. 

Qi Shou agreed, “Sword cultivators and the hearts of people are the foundation of Ascension City. Beyond that, high realms, extensive territories, and large numbers are merely superficial advantages.” 

The Marquis of Gaoye nodded, “Thus, the urgent task at hand is to clearly delineate the powers of the Justice Enforcers, Hidden Officials, and Wealth Store lineages, reducing unnecessary friction. Each lineage must know precisely what they must do, as well as what they can and cannot do.” 

This statement could be seen as the Wealth Store lineage’s candid counsel to the Justice Enforcers, seemingly inappropriate but actually quite fitting. 

This was likely the broader perspective of the Marquis of Gaoye. 

He had already prepared his arguments and began to elaborate on the duties and boundaries of the three lineages. 

During this discussion, Xuezhu from the Justice Enforcers raised an objection, while Xu Ning and Luo Zhenyi from the Hidden Officials lineage expressed differing opinions. 

However, with the earlier contention serving as a foundation, the discussions among the three lineages became relatively lighthearted, even amidst some disagreements. 

Ultimately, they reached a consensus regarding this matter, leaving only minor details to be further adjusted. 

Ning Yao had remained silent throughout. 

These matters were indeed more suited for Dong Buduo and Xu Ning to handle. 

Thus, Ning Yao saw no need to speak up. 

She had never been fond of meddling in trivial matters, and by the time she found it necessary to intervene, it indicated that Ascension City was facing significant issues. 

Qi Shou’s subsequent conclusion struck like thunder on a clear day, “Starting today, while sword cultivators in Ascension City may feel superior, it should not be overly apparent. The habit of determining the significance of matters based on realm must change.” 

Almost everyone turned their gaze toward Ning Yao, as Qi Shou’s words seemed to carry a deeper meaning. 

However, Ning Yao’s expression remained unchanged as she said, “From now on, if any sword cultivator from the Hidden Officials lineage violates regulations, the Justice Enforcers and Wealth Store can bypass me and impose penalties directly, and each punishment should be severe rather than lenient.” 

This statement surprised everyone, yet they felt a sense of relief. 

Strangely, the sword cultivators from the Hidden Officials lineage appeared calm, showing no signs of grievance. 

Ning Yao trusted all the sword cultivators from the Hidden Officials lineage. 

Moreover, she thought that in a few short years, or at most a few decades, they would either seek her out or she would find them, and when that time came, they could let him handle the busywork. 

She had no desire to deal with such affairs; after all, he was the most skilled at it. 

Furthermore, the atmosphere, rules, and principles of the former Hidden Officials lineage had all been established by him. 

In the future, both named and unnamed offerings, as well as those visiting or settling in Ascension City, would inevitably increase. 

Ascension City would gradually become a melting pot of diverse characters. 

The conflicts between outsiders and the indigenous sword cultivators of Ascension City, whether overt or covert, would continue to accumulate, further impacting the sentiments of the local sword cultivators, making the dynamics even more complicated than during the years of the Sword Energy Great Wall. 

The People’s Heart Chapter from the former Hidden Officials lineage had long acknowledged this. Since they had chosen this new path, they could only take it step by step, correcting mistakes as they went. Each rectification was not a bad thing but rather a gain. 

The author of the book had emphatically stated that as long as they used a method of gradually correcting small mistakes to avoid large ones, the hearts of the people would not become chaotic. 

They shouldn’t emulate the sects of the vast world that covered up errors; the sword cultivators of the Sword Energy Great Wall must possess the courage and capability to correct mistakes. 

With power comes arrogance. 

Since the sword cultivators of the Sword Energy Great Wall no longer faced the life-and-death enemy of the wilderness, their true enemy lay within themselves, thus necessitating more focus on cultivating their hearts. 

In the Zushi Hall, as long as the intent was for the benefit of Ascension City, all sword cultivators from the Hidden Officials lineage must be willing to tolerate harsh words and the occasional outburst, and such individuals must not harbor resentment or be excluded once they left the Zushi Hall. 

If those willing to engage in reasoned debate became increasingly difficult to persuade, over time, they would all fall silent. Then, whether or not the Zushi Hall had sword immortals or how many were present would become inconsequential. 

Moreover, all the children raised in the city must remember the senior sword cultivators, both from Ascension City and those from the vast world, ensuring that both parties hold onto their memories. Through educational institutions and the teachings of various scholars, they would learn the true essence of sword cultivators and what it means to be a genuine sword immortal. 

At the end of the booklet, a piece of paper was tucked in, bearing a phrase written in the customary formal script by a young Hidden Official, which read, “To distract you was never my intention.” 

Guo Zhujiu was the first to flip through the book and found this paper, proudly taking it to her master to claim credit. However, when Ning Yao took the paper, she pitied Guo Zhujiu for knocking her head against the door, thumping it repeatedly. 

Ning Yao remained silent for a moment, before adding, “As for when and where I draw my sword, anyone can attempt to stop me.” 

Guo Zhujiu clapped her hands quickly, her palms not touching, making no sound, demonstrating impressive skill. 

Yet, despite Ning Yao’s words hinting at a significant retreat for the Hidden Officials lineage, instead of creating a heavy atmosphere, it fostered a sense of long-lost familiarity. 

It felt as if with Ning Yao present, her saying such words served to reaffirm that Ascension City was still the same as the former Sword Energy Great Wall. 

It was still that city brimming with sword cultivators, where sword immortals flourished the most. 

It remained that hometown where a city of sword cultivators stood against the demons of the vast world. 

After Ning Yao spoke, she continued to listen to the meeting while her thoughts wandered far and wide. 

Currently, she found herself particularly concerned about an enigmatic sword cultivator—one who also ranked among the top ten young talents across several realms—Liu Cai. 

This individual possessed two Sword Nourishing Gourds, using his “thoughts” to nurture the flying sword “Bilu,” and the other to nurture the flying sword “Baiku.” 

Thus, he was the only outsider who truly captured Ning Yao’s attention. It wasn’t due to the claim that “only Liu Cai could rival Ning Yao in the same realm a century later.” 

Rather, it was Liu Cai’s two flying swords that bore exceedingly strange fundamental techniques, seemingly aimed at targeting and even restraining Chen Pingan. 

The flying sword Baiku disregarded the flow of time, surpassing Chen Pingan’s caged bird. 

The flying sword Bilu could break through myriad swords, directly countering Chen Pingan’s Well Moon technique. 

Ning Yao slightly furrowed her brows. 

Qi Shou continued discussing the arrangements for leading teams on excursions. Without the Sword Energy Great Wall, the growth of sword cultivators would slow significantly. 

There were also plans to place spies in the north and south, as well as to cultivate martial artist candidates. Additionally, they needed to rank the sixty pure martial artists currently in Ascension City. 

To achieve true orderly succession, seemingly tedious matters were indispensable. 

As for nurturing spies and assassins, this was a matter of great importance, which would involve the possibility of creating a separate lineage. 

Alternatively, the sword cultivators of the Hidden Officials lineage could take full responsibility for this, thereby augmenting their own authority. 

Qi Shou had already made a decision regarding this matter and directly stated, “This task will be assigned to the Hidden Officials lineage. Otherwise, merely monitoring Ascension City would be a waste of resources.” 

Deng Liang nodded gently. 

As a Justice Enforcer, one should possess this level of generosity. 

This not only prevented the Hidden Officials lineage from nitpicking at the Justice Enforcers, leading to excessive internal strife, but it also allowed the sword cultivators of the former Hidden Officials lineage, who were most adept at intelligence and battle maneuvers, to truly assist Ascension City in focusing on the broader world. 

After today’s meeting at the Zushi Hall, Deng Liang gained a deeper understanding of Qi Shou, the Marquis of Gaoye, and Xuezhu, who were all rising in status among the sword cultivators. 

In Deng Liang’s view, it was possible that Xuezhu, Shuiyu, and Guanzhen, who held unique techniques passed down from their masters, might not yet realize that their small group of three, along with those two elder Yuan Ying cultivators, essentially formed a key existence akin to half of an administrative office and half of a military department. 

Moreover, compared to the two elder sword cultivators, the three from Xuezhu were younger and had higher achievements in their paths. 

Thus, if Deng Liang had the chance, he would surely invite them to drink. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 829: Contending for the World with a City (Part 2) 

Deng Liang had always acknowledged and faced his own selfishness. Those who understand others possess wisdom, while those who understand themselves possess clarity.

They subsequently discussed the strange entities that Ning Yao had slain—remnants resembling ancient deities, yet differing from descriptions found in ancient texts.

Lord Gaoye inquired whether these entities could be subdued and utilized as local spirits to stabilize fortunes and gather spiritual energy.

Ning Yao responded, “It’s very difficult to tame them. There’s a slim chance, but it’s possible. The Hidden Officials will release a book on this later, but it shouldn’t be widely circulated.”

Currently, only a handful of cultivators capable of slaying such beings existed across the realm, making each word in that book invaluable—akin to celestial currency.

Qi Shou said solemnly, “Aside from the sword cultivators of the Hidden Officials, at most ten people in the Ancestor Hall can peruse it. If even a hint of it leaks out, the Hidden Officials will pursue accountability to the end!”

Afterward, the Executioners had work to do. Qi Shou planned to allocate ten Earth Immortal sword cultivators to specifically deal with these entities.

Lord Gaoye requested to accompany them.

The mountains occupied by these entities often housed a considerable quantity of rare materials, and there was a chance of encountering fortuitous caves and blessed lands. This was evidenced by the female Daoist from the Peaceful Mountain of Tongye Province.

Naturally, the Spring House, which controlled all celestial currency, would not sit idly by or have any reason to remain uninvolved.

Even if Lord Gaoye chose to be a recluse, other cultivators under the Spring House would protest vehemently. After all, wealth and power were inseparable. Recently, rumors circulated within the Spring House that their sword cultivators lacked sufficient cultivation realms, so they should resort to accumulating celestial currency instead. Especially among the younger sword cultivators, many would often spout phrases like "not a blade of grass grows," or "picking up scraps is also a skill..."

The atmosphere was concerning.

Currently, the four strange entities of the Ascension City were under Ning Yao’s precarious management.

As for Ning Yao breaking through her realm, it was the least surprising development.

There was also the true identity of Nian Xin.

She donned the attire of a sword cultivator from the Boqi Zhai.

This had caused two young sword cultivators, who had only recently joined the ranks of the Xie Prefecture and the Genzhen Sect, to frown and ask before taking their vows: “Do we really have to wear women’s clothing?”

This infuriated the Xie Prefecture, and junior disciple Shui Yu echoed Gu Jianlong’s words of reason, laughingly asking the two rascals, “What’s wrong with wearing women’s clothing? That esteemed Hidden Official wore it on the battlefield back in the day, looking quite graceful!”

Finally, it was the young generation of accountants in the Spring House who gleamed with ambition, eager to amass wealth.

The subsequent discussions were no trivial matter.

An old sword cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage reported on the current number of sword cultivators in Ascension City and the anticipated number of local sword cultivators over the next century.

Thus, Shui Yu proposed to lead a long journey. The number of sword cultivators didn’t need to be large—three to five would suffice—as he intended to seek out sword cultivator prospects from afar for the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Lord Gaoye suggested developing four additional cities beyond the eight mountain peaks that belonged to Ascension City. This would not only allow for local governance but also accommodate more people, while also serving to hinder external infiltration of Ascension City to a certain extent.

The eight mountain peaks, including Zifu Mountain, had successfully passed their selections today. The Executioners secured five positions while the Spring House obtained three seats, one of which was fiercely contested by Lord Gaoye, resulting in a heated argument between the Spring House cultivators and the Executioners.

The Hidden Officials had too few members to intervene, but Gu Jianlong spoke a few words in favor of the Spring House.

When Lord Gaoye proposed the four new cities, Luo Zhenyi stated that the sword cultivators from the Hidden Officials, or those they nurtured, must occupy a city and serve as the local lord in the future.

Lord Gaoye and Qi Shou exchanged glances and nodded in agreement.

When the conversation shifted to city construction, Luo Zhenyi also brought up the issue of “exclave” areas distant from Ascension City, emphasizing that preparations needed to be made early.

This was a matter of great importance that required utmost caution.

It was highly likely to conflict with various factions.

Due to the prior accountability demanded by the Hidden Officials from the Executioner sword cultivators, and after Deng Liang’s heartfelt words, the cultivators within the Ancestor Hall were momentarily hesitant.

They were genuinely worried about attracting trouble.

Ning Yao said coldly, “In today’s world, aside from the four corners—the extremes of the East, West, South, and North—everywhere else is unclaimed territory. There are no properly established mountain peaks that definitively belong to anyone. We can venture far and seek high ground in each direction, erecting a stele inscribed with the words 'Sword, Qi, Long, City.' Anyone who dares to contest our territory and defy us will be treated as enemies of the Ascension City! If the sword cultivators cannot withstand their celestial techniques, I will personally confront them!”

Within the Ancestor Hall, everyone felt an immense sense of relief.

Deng Liang smiled knowingly, deeply impressed. Truly, this was Ning Yao.

A woman who had never been to the Summer Palace.

Ning Yao rose and stated, “A sword cultivator is a sword cultivator. A hundred or a thousand years from now, at least half of the members of the Ascension City Ancestor Hall must be sword cultivators. Regardless of what happens later, for a thousand years or ten thousand years, if there are any realms left in this world, the last remaining sword cultivator must be here in this Ancestor Hall.”

“After a century, the number of sword immortals in Ascension City must surpass the total of sword immortals in all other realms.”

“In the world, the most sword cultivators will be in Ascension City. The highest sword Dao will also be in Ascension City. This is not some grand ambition; it is simply the natural order.”

Ning Yao wore a golden robe and carried a sword box on her back.

Her brows and eyes sparkled with determination.

Qi Shou was the first to stand, smiling, “What does the Lord of the House say? When will you reach the Jade Purity stage?”

Lord Gaoye stood as well, laughing, “I won’t keep the Executioners waiting too long.”

Everyone in the Ancestor Hall, especially the budding sword immortals, displayed resolute expressions.

The two old Nascent Soul sword cultivators simultaneously rose. The elderly man responsible for incense offerings in the Ancestor Hall clasped his fists and said solemnly, “Then I’ll leave it to all of you!”

In the Chen family mansion on Tai Xiang Street, there was a peculiar child over the years who loved to bask in the sun, living in seclusion and occasionally glancing out at the empty street from the entrance of the Chen family mansion.

His name was Chen Zhi.

This was the new name he had chosen for himself.

In Ascension City, only the Hidden Officials’ Ning Yao, the Executioners’ Nian Xin, and the Spring House’s Lord Gaoye knew his real name.

Aside from them, only a dead servant from the Chen family and a young maid remained. The former was nominally a Gold Core sword cultivator but was, in reality, a Nascent Soul. This young Nascent Soul sword cultivator was not only extremely young and talented but also devoted to the Chen family, ready to sacrifice his life for this child named “Chen Zhi” at any moment.

Zhi means “to comprehend,” while Xi means “brightness.” In the "Book of Songs," it is said that “Zhi Xi means brightness.”

To stabilize the hearts of the people, Zhi NIng inside and out. To create rites and music was to achieve peace through one’s own efforts.

Now, the seven-year-old Chen Zhi—or rather, the former sword immortal Chen Xi of the Sword Qi Great Wall—had actually read quite a bit of books.

Otherwise, the Chen family wouldn’t have a descendant like Chen Sanqiu.

The Chen family of Tai Xiang Street had a small custom. Each year, on the day the character “Chen” was engraved on the city wall, a large basket of illuminating pearls would be scattered onto the street, leading the children of Tai Xiang and Yu Hu Streets to gather early in the morning, waiting to snatch those pearls. Among the generations of children, many eventually became sword immortals, while even more perished in battle before they could.

Today, Chen Zhi stood at the entrance, gazing at the desolate street, and smiled.

There used to be a scoundrel who would push and shove his way through the children, using his fists and feet to steal a large handful each year, only to have a crowd of weeping children follow behind him, crying for their parents.

At this moment, a young maid of ordinary appearance stood beside Chen Zhi, carefully watching the street. She gently reminded, “Master, it’s time to go back.”

Chen Zhi nodded and turned to return to the mansion.

After undergoing a reincarnation, his previous soul was incomplete, and he hadn’t fully awakened. However, his memories remained intact. By relying on a longevity lamp in the Chen ancestral hall, he managed to restore his soul, inevitably altering his temperament somewhat.

The seamstress Nian Xin, who had come from the old prison, had quietly sent a secret letter to him, the master of the Chen family. In the letter, the young Hidden Official asserted that within the city, there were key pieces placed by the wild world, likely low in realm but deeply concealed. As the city expanded rapidly into the fifth realm, one must be cautious of certain pieces that appeared to claim high positions without leaving traces, lest they conspire with those from the three continents who entered this new world.

Thus, within the next sixty years, he earnestly requested the senior Chen Xi to find an opportunity to remind the Summer Palace, especially to closely monitor those familiar faces already in the Ancestor Hall, as well as the newcomers with potential to ascend based on their merits. The Hidden Officials must be vigilant in their inspection. Additionally, they should keep an eye on those sword cultivators who were originally not young, lacking in talent, yet suddenly broke through quickly. If any Earth Immortal could achieve two breakthroughs within a century, they must be particularly cautious.

Walking through the familiar mansion, Chen Zhi smiled slightly.

This Hidden Official truly cared deeply for the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The letter was written in gentle language, meticulously composed, and importantly, it addressed the sender as a junior.

Moreover, the young Hidden Official’s greatest concern was that the old sword immortal Qi Tingji, responsible for guarding the waters of Fuyun Continent, would breach the agreement and enter the fifth realm.

He absolutely could not let Qi Tingji control the lives and deaths of all sword cultivators.

Therefore, it was crucial to be wary of Tongye Continent closing its gates first, while Fuyun Continent would ultimately close later than Nanposuo Continent.

Chen Zhi muttered to himself, “Thank goodness.”

Indeed, the gates of Fuyun Continent closed the latest, but Qi Tingji remained in the Haoran world.

Ultimately, that young man was still worried about the safety of that bride-to-be.

Facts eventually proved that Chen Ping’an had overthought matters.

First, it became evident that Qi Tingji’s resolve was not as thick-skinned as Chen Ping’an had imagined.

Furthermore, Ning Yao’s rapid breakthrough was a mitigating factor. Even if Qi Tingji harbored extreme ambition, attempting to seize power first and rally the sword cultivators of the city to challenge Confucian norms, with Ning Yao present and the Sage of Literature helping to keep watch, he wouldn’t easily succeed. Moreover, Bai Ye's relationship with that old scholar and the power held by Qi Shou’s descendants would surely have led Qi Tingji to weigh his options carefully.

However, Chen Zhi did not think that this “after-the-fact concern” was unnecessary. On the contrary, it was quite essential.

After all, Qi Tingji had nearly become the second Xiao Xian back in the day.

Such a person, if he had never entertained the thought of being the first in a new realm, seizing the fortune of the Dao and ultimately ascending to the Fourteenth Realm, no one would believe it.

In fact, the young Hidden Official was the first to disbelieve, and Chen Zhi was the second.

Once Qi Tingji became completely unhinged and tore off the facade, choosing to invade the fifth realm, the first person he would target would undoubtedly be Ning Yao, and the second would certainly be him, “Chen Xi.”

As for Chen Zhi himself, he had taken it slow over the years, breaking through one realm a year, and now he had just reached the Gold Core stage.

The reason why two chairs remained empty at the table beneath the portraits in the Ancestor Hall was significant.

One chair was reserved for the future city lord, while the other was meant for the first Ascension stage sword immortal in the history of Ascension City.

One represented the face of Ascension City, and the other represented its inner strength.

However, whoever could become the face of Ascension City would not be lacking.

If all went as expected, it would be Chen Zhi sitting in one chair, and Ning Yao sitting in the other. 

Yet, Chen Zhi didn’t mind if Ning Yao occupied both chairs alone; he would even welcome Qi Shou maturing quickly and becoming capable enough to occupy the city lord’s chair that originally belonged to him.

After his reincarnation, Chen Zhi’s soul had slightly changed, and his disposition had inevitably altered. He was more interested in the Haoran world and the Qingming world.

He genuinely wished to fly alone with his sword in the future and roam through the two realms.

However, if within a hundred years, no suitable junior could demonstrate the qualification to secure the position of city lord, there would be no choice but for him to step into the Ancestor Hall of Ascension City.

Regardless, the rise of Ascension City was unstoppable.

Even if there were those who obstructed it, Chen Zhi was still Chen Xi.

He was the sword cultivator who had carved characters on the walls of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

As dusk fell and the shop was about to close, Zheng Dafeng, the temporary shopkeeper who had worked hard all day, leisurely drank wine with one foot propped up on a long bench, scanning the two rows of taverns lining the street. With no women in sight, his gaze swept past, but once a woman appeared, he couldn’t help but stare.

A young boy poured a bowl of wine for the temporary shopkeeper and shook his head, saying, “Dafeng, you’re really slacking off. Today’s meeting in the Ancestor Hall was such a big event, and you didn’t even get a chance to listen in as a mere doorkeeper? You still have the face to teach people how to punch?”

Zheng Dafeng bent down, sniffing the aroma of the wine, not in a hurry to drink. He raised his head to smile at Feng Kangle, “Is your big brother Dafeng someone who cares about these trivial names? In that Ancestor Hall, how many girls do you think I could see? How could it compare to sitting here?”

Currently, aside from the out-of-town Zheng Dafeng, everyone else in the tavern were familiar faces.

The two young helpers, Qiu Long and Liu E.

The two errand boys, Feng Kangle and Tao Ban.

The wine remained the same—Bamboo Sea Cave Sky Wine, Qingshen Mountain Wine, and the wine from the Mute Lake, accompanied by pickled vegetables and plain noodles.

The bowls were the same size as before.

Feng Kangle spat disdainfully, “This Zheng Dafeng relies on that smile and gaze that even a personal scholar can’t learn, scaring off who knows how many women who used to come here for drinks. If it weren’t for the extra old bachelors and gamblers today, my good friend Tao Ban would say he’s going to revolt against Zheng Dafeng.”

In the distance, Tao Ban, who was wiping the tables, couldn’t help but ask again, “Dafeng, do you think I’m the kind of martial arts genius that no one can see?”

When this boy was still a child, he had asked a similar question to the second shopkeeper, only changing “martial arts genius” to “sword immortal prospect.”

Zheng Dafeng was still in charge of teaching martial arts.

This wine-loving shopkeeper, who was particularly keen to steal the limelight, never drank before or after teaching martial arts.

Jiang Yun, Xu Gong from the Mumei Alley, and Yuan Zao Hua.

These three were the fastest learners of martial arts. With the favorable timing from the new realm, Jiang Yun had obtained martial fortunes twice, while Xu Gong and Yuan Zao Hua each had one.

There was also a little girl from Yuhu Street, Sun Qu, who had a younger sister named Sun Zao, a sword immortal prospect who had been taken away from the Sword Qi Great Wall by a female sword immortal. Learning martial arts was also an option.

In truth, the first batch of ten children showed great potential in martial arts. The two selected later by Nian Xin were also quite promising.

The following forty or so children were of a lesser caliber.

The so-called “strongest” refers to a kind of horizontal comparison among martial artists of the same realm.

However, the stronger one’s foundation, the more martial fortunes one receives. If at the time of breakthrough, there’s a height of “unprecedented,” when martial fortunes arrive, it becomes even more spectacular.

Whether one could achieve the strongest breakthrough also depended on luck, such as being at the same realm as Cao Ci or Chen Ping’an, and breaking through before them—how could one compete for the title of strongest?

Before Cao Ci and Chen Ping’an, being in the same realm as senior brother Li Er and Prince Wang Changjing was a similarly bleak situation for other pure martial artists.

Zheng Dafeng took a sip of wine, leaning back, and turned to his side, “In any case, I can’t see it. I only see that you kid has good fortune with the ladies.”

Tao Ban complained, “What’s the use of good fortune? You’re still far behind the second shopkeeper. When the second shopkeeper was around, there were so many female customers, but now that you’re here, they’ve all run off.”

Zheng Dafeng clicked his tongue, “You’ve got to be struck by lightning for saying that.”

A beautiful girl’s gaze can make one feel as if they should wear an extra thick cotton coat in winter. Yet, it can also have a bewitching effect, making a man feel as if he’s shedding clothes in the scorching summer, feeling cool yet warm at heart.

Unfortunately, the young boy was ignorant of such matters.

Zheng Dafeng glanced elsewhere.

Liu E liked Qiu Long, but Qiu Long had long had a sister in his heart—the true owner of the shop, the head shopkeeper, Die Zhang.

Zheng Dafeng still had some insight into this.

So, behind the scenes, the man glanced at Liu E, who was greeting customers in the distance, half-jokingly advising the young man who seemed to be perpetually troubled, “Why not cherish the one in front of you?”

After all, no matter how good the sister far away might be, she was still out of reach. Sadly, Qiu Long probably understood this simple principle but couldn’t act on it.

Liking someone isn’t too hard, but not liking someone you once liked is not easy.

With a completely different style of business from the young Hidden Official, Zheng Dafeng quickly established himself in Ascension City. Although business was still not as good as in previous years, at least it was no longer desolate.

Moreover, Zheng Dafeng also had a gambling habit. Most importantly, in the beginning, all the gamblers and punters viewed Zheng Dafeng as a kindred spirit of the second shopkeeper, being cautious around him. It wasn’t until several encounters later that they realized it had been a false alarm. It turned out that Zheng Dafeng was of great integrity, with superior gambling quality, and would lose every time.

As time went on, the drinkers all began to claim that the character of the second shopkeeper, who used to be ignored even by dogs, had been picked up by brother Zheng.

Everyone addressed Zheng Dafeng as “brother,” claiming that if there were more heroes like him in the Haoran world and fewer like the second shopkeeper, the people would indeed live a simpler life.

Zheng Dafeng’s catchphrase was to hold up an empty wine bowl and say to everyone, “I’ll propose the first toast!”

Indeed, he would raise a toast, but he always lifted the guests’ drinks.

Additionally, Zheng Dafeng pointed out the ten great fairies and the top ten beauties of the younger generation, with the bachelor drinkers praising him and giving him thumbs up.

It was rumored that Guo Zhujiu secretly gave some money to purchase a few more jars of wine for the tavern, negotiating with Zheng Dafeng to elevate a certain old maiden’s ranking, so as not to appear too pitiful and risk her not getting married.

The ones who loved to stroll around here the most, aside from Guo Zhujiu, were Gu Jianlong, who enjoyed listening to stories, and those who liked to drink while listening to tales.

Of course, Zheng Dafeng would tell different stories to different people. Guo Zhujiu only liked to hear stories related to her master; the size of the story was not that important. This inevitably left Brother Dafeng feeling unsatisfied, thinking he had eighteen skills but nowhere to use them, and thus began to tell Gu Jianlong stories about celestial battles, which were the best accompaniments to wine.

The speaker had intention, and the listener grasped it; it could be said that they were half-master and half-disciple.

Gu Jianlong preferred tales of conflicts between men and women, so when Brother Dafeng told a story about women fighting, she was dumbfounded. The next time they drank, even Wang Xinshui eagerly followed along, wanting to seek knowledge from Brother Dafeng.

Zheng Dafeng drank a bowl of sorrowful wine, sighing.

That bunch of kids learning martial arts from him, especially the group led by young Jiang Yun, were simply too annoying.

They either complained he wasn’t handsome enough or criticized his punching style. 

He was far inferior to the young Hidden Official, at least by eighteen streets.

Zheng Dafeng felt a sense of helplessness.

If only his father looked like Wei Ban or Jiang Shangzhen, would he still be single today? Wouldn’t he have to stand at the door every day to prevent girls from barging in and being inappropriate?

But when did he become inferior even to Chen Ping’an?

Zheng Dafeng rubbed his chin, thinking he was still pretty outstanding compared to that mountain lord, right? 

Just consider that Cen Yuanji every time she passed by the gates of the Fallen Mountain, she would look at him, wanting to speak but then shy away. But when she saw the young mountain lord, she never said a word and wouldn’t even glance his way.

Feng Kangle and Tao Ban sat nearby, each eating a bowl of plain noodles.

Feng Kangle curiously asked, “Dafeng, what does ‘Get up and scratch your head’ mean? Why are there so many drunks fond of randomly spouting that phrase now?”

After getting drunk following a teaching session, Zheng Dafeng had once blurted out a nonsensical speech beginning with “Get up and scratch your head.”

Zheng Dafeng shifted into a cross-legged position, casually saying, “It’s a dish meant to trick people into drinking more, or rather, a kind of snack that doesn’t cost anything whether you’re selling or buying liquor.”

“Get up and scratch your head! Look at the flowers blooming and falling outside, the greenery thickening and reddening. Then look at that dim light, as a lovely lady walks by in a new skirt, her steps quiet. Finally, gaze at the bright moonlit night, where a beauty plays with her jade fingers, her nails like crystals. At last, raise a glass and gaze at the solitary light that shines, with one’s liver and lungs turning to ice and snow!”

Tao Ban remarked, “Some heartless bastards say that our second shopkeeper is a scholar, so he’s the blackest-hearted when it comes to selling wine. But Dafeng, you’re not a scholar, so why do you have that whole set of sayings?”

Zheng Dafeng laughed, “There was a saying I once read in a book that said, ‘Scholars can never bear to see money or power; once they do, they become worse than a whore!’ Such scholars, you aren’t the second shopkeeper, nor am I. I just can’t bear to see pretty girls passing by, their heads lowered in shyness, their steps too hurried. If it’s a hot summer day, then they can hurry a little faster.”

Tao Ban didn’t quite understand, only saying, “I don’t care whether you’re a scholar or not. I just know that those girls you see aren’t being shy.”

Zheng Dafeng slammed the table and turned to shout, “Liu E, what do you think of your brother Dafeng?!”

The young woman was startled and managed a smile, shyly saying, “The shopkeeper’s gaze isn’t right, but he’s actually a good person.”

Tao Ban chuckled, rolling up a chunk of noodles from his bowl, saying he would propose a toast too, while Feng Kangle laughed so hard he put down his chopsticks and clapped the table.

Zheng Dafeng straightened up, raising his wine bowl high, “Get up and scratch your head, I’ll propose a toast!”

Suddenly, Tao Ban said, “I heard that once the door closes, it’ll be a hundred years. I’m not a sword cultivator and can’t learn martial arts. Will I not see the second shopkeeper for the rest of my life?”

Feng Kangle fell silent in an instant.

Zheng Dafeng laughed, “Not a chance. Chen Ping’an wouldn’t let you all go. All our dear second shopkeeper’s travels are for the sake of reunion.”

Tao Ban laughed, “If you speak well, drink more. I can treat you to a jar of Mute Lake wine.”

Having drunk his fill, Zheng Dafeng gently shook his white bowl, “Riches scatter people, while the carefree are like small gods without worries. Who would’ve thought that here too, we could lead a comfortable life?”

Feng Kangle suddenly asked, “Dafeng, how old are you?”

Zheng Dafeng grinned, “Still a young lad who can fry pancakes. If you don’t believe me, I can fry you an egg next time.”

Tao Ban rolled his eyes, saying, “If you were a scholar, I’d let Feng Kangle take your last name.”

Zheng Dafeng looked at the darkening sky and said, “All right, let’s clean up and go back home.”

Zheng Dafeng had rented a small house not far from the tavern in Yan Chi Alley.

After closing the shop and arriving at his residence, Zheng Dafeng opened the courtyard door and cheerfully called out, “Nian Xin!”

For some reason, Nian Xin, who had come for business, saw Zheng Dafeng grinning and rubbing his hands together and simply left.

Zheng Dafeng was disheartened, feeling he hadn’t hosted properly. Once he seated himself in the inner room, he lit the lantern and began to peruse a book he had painstakingly borrowed from Zhu Lian about celestial beings from the mountains. Some pages contained colorful illustrations.

Sitting upright, engrossed in the book, Zheng Dafeng finally closed it, hunching slightly as he walked to the door, leaning against it with his arms crossed, gazing into the night.

Many wandering souls in the world journeyed as far as their strength allowed, glancing back at the distant mountains and waters—unafraid of the long road home, only fearing that when they returned, they would find their old stories had already been forgotten.

Today, Zheng Dafeng was suddenly reminded by Feng Kangle’s question that according to the calculations from the mountain below, as long as he didn’t remain single, he should already have grandchildren.

A man being single is a loss of an eight-foot frame. How could one not feel troubled?

Zheng Dafeng grabbed a handful of sunflower seeds from the table, poured himself a jug of Mute Lake wine, and sat on the threshold, drinking while cracking seeds.

Yet, while cracking seeds and sipping wine, thinking of the Fallen Mountain, Zheng Dafeng felt slightly relieved.

In the past, he had seen all the children of the young generation in that small town of Lizhu Cave Sky.

However, they were no longer young and certainly not children anymore.

After all, even Li Huai had long since come of age.

Zheng Dafeng drank his wine, pondering. Indeed, it was time to “Get up and scratch your head” and let the wine flow.

When Zheng Dafeng thought of that grand wave of martial fortunes surging, he raised his wine jug, laughing, “It’s worth a toast.”

In the realm of martial artists, the most critical was the martial arts summit of the Fallen Mountain.

Because at that peak of martial arts, four individuals would soon stand side by side, and two of them would surely reach the pinnacle, while the other two would at least have a chance of doing so.

The steward Zhu Lian was already at the peak. The first disciple Pei Qian was about to reach the peak. The doorkeeper Zheng Dafeng could reach it at any time.

As for the mountain lord Chen Ping’an, he was the strongest, having ascended to the peak with “unprecedented” might.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 830: The Round-Faced Girl

In the central region of Tongye Continent, it should have been a splendid season for the rain to nourish a hundred grains, clear and pure. Unfortunately, just like last year, no one had picked the tender, fragrant shoots before the rain. Countless green tea mountains were gradually becoming overgrown with weeds, and every household, rich or poor, no longer possessed even a hint of the fragrance of the pre-rain spring tea.

The Northern Jin Dynasty had enjoyed a long period of peace. However, compared to the rest of the continent, it was unfortunately located in a region that was a battleground for military conflicts. Previously, the border cavalry of the Yao family of the Great Quan Dynasty, separated by the 800-mile Songzhen Lake and the Jin Huang Mountain Divine Mansion, had maintained a relatively peaceful coexistence. But with the sudden onset of a celestial upheaval, all the strategies and efforts to strengthen the state were rendered meaningless. The Northern Jin Dynasty had now become a mere shadow of its former self, its vast lands in disarray and devastation.

The Southern Qi, located north of the Great Quan Dynasty, fared little better than the Northern Jin. In the end, they were left with a single emperor who had not shown his face in years, while the feudal lords governed in his stead and the empress acted as a puppet controller. They were still engaged in battles against the monstrous armies from the barbaric lands, but there was no hope of victory, only a continuous retreat, with the Great Quan’s border cavalry reduced to nearly nothing.

The old capital of Southern Qi had turned into a military encampment for the troops of the Taiping Mountain. Meanwhile, the Great Quan Dynasty had lost more than half of its territory, with border forces nearly wiped out. The various state and provincial armies could only retreat to the capital region, and it was rumored that once they captured the renowned Shinjing City, their military tents would be relocated.

The monstrous army from the barbaric lands had landed on the western coast of Tongye Continent years ago. With over thirty military encampments, they advanced methodically, primarily targeting the entrenched celestial sect strongholds. Their campaign spread from west to east, and from south to north, showing little regard for the human dynasties and feudal states along the way. Towns were submerged and ruthlessly destroyed, with no attempts at surrender or pacification. Cities fell, lives were lost, and the fallen were reanimated by the great demon Lord Bai Ying, transforming them into vast armies of bones that only knew death.

Under the golden sun, a vast expanse of golden clouds above the remnants of the Northern Jin lands suddenly saw six rainbow lights halt mid-air before plunging rapidly toward the earth.

A strong wind blew through the sky, ruffling the hair of six young figures—three men and three women. They broke through the cloud cover, revealing an expansive view below.

Among them, a man in a black robe, his hair tied with a white silk ribbon, descended from the sky, resembling an immortal fallen from grace.

Beneath the sea of clouds lay a towering yet dilapidated city, the remnants of a once-great state capital of Northern Jin, barely holding on amid the chaos. This state capital's defensive formation was said to be more robust than many smaller kingdoms' capitals, thanks to two extraordinary individuals within the city: a Golden Core master skilled in formations and a formidable Nascent Soul cultivator, who had worked diligently to keep the crumbling city intact. However, this was not the true reason for the city’s survival; the real reason lay in a celestial being, a major demon, who had earlier been stationed to oversee the grand formation. He had struck down a powerful enemy nearby, causing many of the great demons to avoid this place, deeming it too ominous.

Had it not been for the persistent efforts of Xun Yuan and Jiang Shangzhen from the Yuguizong, who relied on the concentrated fortune of the continent's formation to target celestial beings and ascendant demons, Tongye Continent would have fallen much earlier. Xun Yuan, with his high cultivation and the ability to treat the continent as a small universe, instilled fear in several ascendant demons. Meanwhile, though Jiang Shangzhen was only at the celestial level, his fierce and cunning flying sword made him a formidable adversary. Each time he descended with his sword, he targeted not the ascendant demons but the lower-tier demon cultivators, claiming countless lives.

With a single strike, he could reduce a demon at the Jade Core level—who could kill half a kingdom—either to death or to a state of collapse.

The two major demons, Yang Zhi and Fei Fei, who had returned from the waters between Baoping Continent and North Julu Continent, were specifically looking for traces of Xun Yuan and Jiang Shangzhen.

Yang Zhi had once fought fiercely against Xun Yuan, resulting in injuries on both sides. After that encounter, Xun Yuan had become even more elusive. Only Jiang Shangzhen continued to occasionally strike down enemies in the mortal realm. Fei Fei attempted several times to intercept him, but Jiang Shangzhen’s myriad illusions and methods of escape were extremely elusive, making it impossible to capture him.

In contrast, every time the head of the Great Fushu Academy took action, it was primarily to protect the dynasty and the academy’s formations, slowing the advance of the barbaric forces.

With the fall of Taiping Mountain and Fuyi Sect, there were no longer any grand formations left in Tongye Continent. The timing had shifted, placing Xun Yuan and Jiang Shangzhen in the heart of the barbaric lands, especially Xun Yuan, who had been ambushed by Yang Zhi and Fei Fei at the end of last year, leading to rumors that he had escaped from Tongye Continent and vanished into a secret marine realm, followed by a “little girl with braided hair” who had trailed behind.

The black-robed man wielded a long sword, first breaking through the defensive array and then shattering several incoming magical artifacts with a single strike.

In the city, a golden-armored deity, worshipped in a martial temple, stepped out of the threshold, seemingly alerted by the celestial master not to leave the shrine. This being, once a loyal spirit of the nation, brandished a treasured blade that had absorbed incense for hundreds of years, proactively emerging to engage in battle. He soared into the air, but the black-robed man shattered his golden body with his own flying sword, leaving the city raining down golden fragments.

The remaining five demon cultivators landed within the city. Although the city’s protective array had not been breached, they could not stop the intruders from overpowering it.

One towering demon warrior, over ten feet tall, landed and surveyed his surroundings. He chose a direction and charged straight through the city, smashing through the various markets and buildings, leaving a trail of destruction. Those unfortunate enough to be caught in his path were obliterated, their remains scattered. He continued until he reached the outer city wall, then switched routes, using his resilient physique as a battering ram, mercilessly cleaving through the city.

A sword cultivator picked a densely built area and moved slowly, absorbing the souls and blood of the living, leaving behind desiccated corpses.

Another demon targeted the City God Pavilion, suddenly revealing its true form as a three-hundred-foot-long python, scales glimmering, releasing miasma that corroded wood and stone. It surrounded the entire City God Pavilion and struck its head against the high walls, smashing a plaque bestowed by the Northern Jin monarch. The demon endured numerous magical attacks and heavy artifacts raining down upon it, while the City God and his underlings summoned numerous spirits to attack, all futile against the giant serpent.

A young woman dressed in a green gown, tall and slender, formed a hand seal, summoning her flying sword, “Peacock Feather.” Behind her, like a peacock displaying its plumage, appeared 81 dazzling sword lights made from peacock feathers. Each slender sword light had feathered eyes resembling those of a woman, creating more tiny flying swords, a manifestation of her sword art. As the sword lights shot forth, they left trails of green luminescence in the air, heading straight for the provincial governor’s residence, leaving destruction in their wake.

Another sword cultivator, resembling her, landed on the city wall crowded with soldiers.

Yushi landed on a high rooftop of a noble family’s mansion, not engaging in the rampant slaughter like her companions. She had merely come to unwind, traveling from the Southern Qi capital in search of some amusement. The others were all old acquaintances.

The sword cultivators charging alongside her were friends of Yushi, though they originally had not been well acquainted.

The scattered cities that had not yet been ravaged by the flames of war were few and far between. It was challenging to find remnants of large states like Northern Jin, which were mostly located in remote regions governed by feudal lords, where the military cultivators practiced their skills and vied for merits. Otherwise, such opportunities wouldn't present themselves.

Sitting on the rooftop, Yushi rested her sword across her lap, glancing at the chaos unfolding in the noble residence without concern.

After the Sword Qi Great Wall had been split in two and the cities “ascended” to the fifth realm, and after the old site of the Overhanging Mountain had been cleared for the army’s path at sea, capturing Fuyou Continent and Tongye Continent had actually taken longer than anticipated by two or three years. Otherwise, the barbaric lands would not have been merely a half-continent of Jin Jia Continent but would have included the entire Baoping Continent.

The losses sustained at the Sword Qi Great Wall were significant, surpassing the initial projections of the Jiazi Camp by about thirty percent.

In truth, this was already a conservative estimate. Yushi knew the reality was more like a forty percent increase.

One misstep could lead to a cascade of failures; the battlefield at the Sword Qi Great Wall was far beyond mere “one thread pulled causing the whole tapestry to unravel.”

The established strategy of the Jiazi Camp was to divide their forces into three, but that was merely a facade to distract the Posa Continent while a small number of elite forces, including Liu Cha, led a fraction of the troops to hold off the enemy. As for Fuyou Continent, it was to be taken, but they were not in a rush regarding Jin Jia Continent. The initial strategy was to push northward from Tongye Continent, swiftly capturing Baoping Continent and North Julu Continent, assimilating the fortunes of the southeastern Tongye Continent and southwestern Fuyou Continent within four years. In fact, Tongye Continent should have changed hands two years ago, becoming part of the barbaric lands.

The Jiazi Camp was not led by sword cultivators, but the young man in wooden clogs had once made a metaphor that the influx of the barbaric army onto the two continents was like sowing beans in a field.

At the beginning of their landing, without dividing their forces, they appeared to be unstoppable. However, compared to the vast land of the continent, their numbers were still too few. They required a continuous influx of reinforcements to fill the gaps in the two continents' territory.

Afterward, they needed to carry out what Mr. Zhou referred to as “transplanting seedlings in wet rice fields,” not treating the two continents as a barren land to plunder. Following the initial shock, they must shift to pacifying the fragmented dynasties, winning over the rogue cultivators among the mountains, aiming to harvest a bountiful autumn within a decade, not expecting a bumper crop but at least managing to convert some of the human forces into the northern armies of the barbaric lands. The focus would be on those desperate mountain cultivators, scattered in the rivers and lakes, as well as various officials and warriors, who would be the first to unite into one army, selecting one or two individuals to enter the Jiazi Camp, taking their opinions seriously.

Thus, once they secured Baoping Continent and Jin Jia Continent, the barbaric lands could establish a firm foothold, trading away half of Fuyou Continent or a portion of Jin Jia Continent to reclaim North Julu Continent.

By then, the barbaric lands would control Tongye, Baoping, and North Julu Continent.

As for the so-called return of Fuyou Continent, in reality, the Jiazi Camp had long since established methods to ensure the complete subjugation of a continent, preventing the barbaric lands from seizing its fortunes. The righteous lands would only regain countless shattered “islands,” like pieces of broken porcelain. Just restoring the old mountains and rivers of the continent closest to the barbaric lands would require immense effort, resources, and goodwill from the central territories.

Due to his special status, Yushi was far from being just one of the Jiazi Camp cultivators or a fledgling sword cultivator under Taiping Mountain, thus he could discern these shocking truths.

A female sword cultivator changed her mind and flew over on her sword toward Yushi.

Her long sword was of considerable quality, drawing a vibrant, colorful arc of light in the air.

Her name was Xian Zao, and together with her sister Yin Su, they were a pair of sword cultivators. Although they were not listed among the hundred sword immortals of Taiping Mountain, they were direct disciples of the major sect, Guanghan City, and were both over three hundred years old.

Guanghan City was one of the sects under the great demon Fei Fei. Years ago, Fei Fei and the lord of the Liuluo River, Yang Zhi, battled for many years, with the female cultivators from Guanghan City contributing significantly.

When Xian Zao transformed into her human form, she appeared to be a young woman with a sharp chin and delicate features. She lifted her skirt, bowed, and called out to Yushi, “Young Master Yushi.”

Yushi did not rise but smiled and nodded.

In the barbaric lands, etiquette was of utmost importance. Those who were overly polite would only provoke the opposite reaction.

After she sheathed her sword, Xian Zao sat down not far from Yushi but did not dare to draw too close. She rested her chin in her hands, observing the chaotic city and softly said, “Young Master Yushi, I’m feeling a bit tired of all this killing. The Righteous Lands have so many cities—capitals, provincial capitals, county cities—more cities than people. Thankfully, they are too timid; they scare themselves half to death before they even think of resisting. In the beginning, I was excited, thinking I wouldn’t have to fight as dangerously as I did at the Sword Qi Great Wall, but now that I’ve killed so many, it’s becoming rather dull.”

Yushi chuckled, “That’s the Righteous Lands for you—prosperous. As long as there’s no war, and no major droughts or locust plagues, people get along harmoniously, and fighting is rare, so the population grows. It’s quite different from our homeland.”

Before the appearance of the great ancestor of Taiping Mountain, the barbaric lands had been in a state of chaos for ten thousand years.

The true world was tumultuous, with demons rampaging. In such a world, there was no concept of “indiscriminate killing.”

Xian Zao pointed toward a part of the city and asked, “I see these kinds of stone arches everywhere. My sister and I can’t read the words on them. Young Master Yushi, you’ve studied, so you know about the Righteous Lands. What are they for?”

The script in the barbaric lands was ancient, said to share a rough origin with that of the Righteous Lands, yet they had evolved differently. Because of this shared origin, even the Confucian sage’s original script was greatly feared by all demons. About a thousand years ago, a writing system called “Shuiyun Shu” began to spread, created by Mr. Zhou, known as the “Literary Sea of the World.”

Yushi explained, “These are unique to the Righteous Lands, used to honor virtuous men and women with good morals. I’ve read that those who are righteous are to be memorialized. Essentially, if a family erects an arch, their descendants will prosper.”

Xian Zao expressed her confusion, “These people sound impressive, but after all these years of fighting, it seems to have been of little use.” 

She had indeed encountered some odd individuals, such as an elderly woman with white hair holding a cane, standing at the entrance of a family shrine. Though she would ultimately die like a tattered piece of cotton, she was unafraid of death—was it because she had lived long enough? She had seen an elderly man clad in scholarly robes who, though facing imminent danger, could only wait for death, dying beside a table piled with books, his hand holding a child, urging the little one to “speak loudly.” Listening to the trembling voice of the younger generation, it might have been a family teaching or words from a sage’s book?

Regardless, when the old man died, his expression was far more composed than many cultivators who offered magical treasures and divine coins, or even the emperors and generals who lay prostrate.

Yet, what significance did it hold? Xian Zao felt it had no meaning; after all, whether old or young, everyone would die.

However, many places that the military camp had deemed “worth attacking”—battlefields, defensive lines, and fortresses—were often easily breached. 

Some high-walled cities fell within mere exchanges, easily conquered.

The newly minted armor was still bright, and the veterans were few.

Only a few sects and the elite troops from seven or eight dynasties had caused some trouble for the barbaric lands.

Especially in the assault on a place called Taiping Mountain, the casualties were heavy, causing two military camps to exhaust their entire forces, ultimately necessitating the dispatch of two additional armies.

Yushi chuckled, finding it difficult to explain the futility of these ethereal matters. They might have a role in educating the heart, yet were utterly useless in battles. Each arch, in a time of peace, was priceless, but in a chaotic world, seemed utterly worthless.

Yushi watched as an elder Nascent Soul cultivator finally could no longer restrain himself, having left the protective formation and engaged in battle alongside Yin Su. She had killed far too many and was deliberately showing off for him. That brute had even taken several heads and casually tossed them onto the formation, creating ripples as if blood had splattered against the walls. As for the giant python, it had resumed its human form and captured two deities from the City God Pavilion, crushing their golden bodies against the formation's outer wall.

Having spoken to him for a while, Xian Zao felt satisfied. She stood up, saying apologetically, “Young Master Yushi, I must go now. Otherwise, my sister will complain that I’m slacking off, and she can go on about it for a long time.”

Yushi waved his hand, smiling as he reminded her, “Be careful of those two human Earth Immortal cultivators. Don't let your guard down just because you’re a Golden Core sword cultivator. Human cultivators are clever, and once they set their minds to it, they can be quite decisive in death.”

Xian Zao nodded vigorously.

Young Master Yushi was of noble birth, yet he was always so easygoing and gentle in his words.

Yushi watched Xian Zao as she departed on her sword, still not intending to intervene.

Having been on the battlefield near the Sword Qi Great Wall too many times, he had accumulated quite a bit of merit and suffered little loss, except for that one significant incident.

After the barbaric lands breached the Sword Qi Great Wall, although their pace in this unfamiliar world slowed slightly, it felt like two Nascent Soul cultivators struggling to subdue an incredibly tough Golden Core sword cultivator, only to find it much easier to deal with a group of lower-tier cultivators whose morale had shattered.

Yushi stood up and looked down.

A well-dressed young man, whose face could almost be described as jade-like, was peeking through the window of a study, watching him.

Another young man, dressed in coarse clothing, was particularly interesting. Upon seeing Xian Zao soaring on her sword, he dashed up to the nearby rooftop, mustered his courage, and stammered, “Are you a mountain cultivator here to save people?”

Yushi replied in the elegant dialect of Tongye Continent, “I don’t understand your Northern Jin dialect.”

To his surprise, the young man immediately switched to the elegant dialect, “Immortal Master, can I practice immortal techniques with you?”

Yushi shook his head, “I’m a demon, not an immortal master. Naturally, I’m not here to save anyone; I’ve come to kill.”

The young man was taken aback.

Yushi waved his hand, “Quickly hide. Wait ten or twenty years, and you might survive.”

The young man’s expression suddenly changed. His eyes gleamed with fervor as he said, “I know where the treasures are hidden in the mansion. I’m willing to lead you there. Can I follow you later?”

Yushi smiled, “Sure, lead the way. I can indeed grant you great wealth. After the world turns upside down, it’s time for new beginnings.”

After all, he was free and had nothing better to do.

Recalling a saying from the Jiazi Camp regarding when the hearts of the people would settle after the barbaric lands took over a continent: it was when all survivors of the war believed they had no way back, no chance to rectify their mistakes. They needed to feel that even if they returned to the Righteous Lands, there would still be no path for them as they would surely be held accountable later. Only then could they be at ease in serving the barbaric lands, becoming even more ferocious and deadly than the demon cultivators themselves. For example, within a nation, ministers would slay their kings in the court, various officials would select someone to die, and within each family, the same principle would apply. This would also occur in ancestral temples, where people would commit heinous acts. Mountain cultivators would have their disciples kill their ancestors, leading to bloodshed among their own sects.

All the rules and rituals painstakingly established by Confucianism would crumble. They would start anew, and for the next thousand years, the only morality that would remain would be that established by Mr. Zhou.

It was said that the young man in wooden clogs was now not only following Mr. Zhou but had also received a surname from him.

Yushi floated down and reached out, pulling the young man, who felt as if he were riding the clouds, beside him. Yushi intentionally ignored the young man’s sweating face and casually asked, “Is there anything you wish to obtain? Perhaps a certain woman you never dared to hope for? Or someone you wish to kill, like someone you hate the most?”

The young man gritted his teeth and replied, “I don’t want anything for myself; everything should rightfully belong to you, Master. I dare not ask for anything. But I want to kill two people!”

Yushi raised an eyebrow in curiosity, “Who are they?”

The young man clenched his fists, trembling, “One is called Han Chengyi, the young master of this residence, and the other is Han Shuyi, his sister. She’s a woman who has just returned home.”

Yushi laughed, “What deep hatred do you have for that brother and sister?”

It was apparent that this person was a servant of the residence, possibly born into a lowly background.

The young man shook his head, then clenched his fists, trembling, with his head lowered, “I just want them to die! One is born lucky, and the other is an unashamed wretch!”

Yushi stopped and made the young man look up, meeting his gaze, the latter’s forehead beaded with sweat.

Yushi smiled, “In the Righteous Lands, the bad people are the good people in the barbaric lands. Don’t worry, you won’t die. I will also help you fulfill your wish. However, with me around, you might be worried about not being able to do what you once considered evil. Before you kill, you can do some things you’ve always wanted to do; for instance, if you want to kill two, then kill more. I’ll wait for you here. Don’t worry about me waiting too long; I’m quite free.”

As he spoke, Yushi took out a small, exquisite yellow silk pouch from his waist. When his fingers brushed against it, clouds and rainbows emerged. A small black dragon wound around the pouch’s surface, enveloping it in mist.

Yushi lightly shook the yellow pouch, and the black dragon fell to the ground, transforming into a robust man with pitch-black eyes. Yushi tossed the pouch to the young man, “Take it. In the future, this dragon servant will act as your protector, teaching you immortal techniques and helping you become an influential figure in Tongye Continent. Don’t think that just because you are from the Han family, even the once-mighty emperor or the mountain Earth Immortals will bow low and treat you with respect.”

“By the way, what’s your name?”

The young man took the pouch with both hands, his expression excited, voice trembling, “Master, my name is Lu Jianxin. Jian as in ‘to inspect,’ and Xin as in ‘heart.’ I once had an older brother named Lu Jiaoguang.”

Yushi chuckled, “To educate the young is to bring great brightness; to examine the heart is to be diligent and alert. Those are good names your father must have asked the family tutor for, right?”

Lu Jianxin wiped the sweat from his forehead, “Master is truly knowledgeable.”

Yushi waved his hand, “From now on, follow me, do more work, and speak less. You can skip the flattery and pandering; that will get you killed.”

Lu Jianxin no longer dared to speak out of turn. He bowed and ran off, the black dragon following behind, causing the young man to feel both frightened and suddenly emboldened.

Yushi planned to make this Lu Jianxin the lord of the state city, allowing the young man to experience a comfortable life as a local ruler. Then he would have the black dragon meticulously record the changes in the city’s customs and hand it over to the young man in wooden clogs for review.

As for why Lu Jianxin held such a deep-seated hatred for the siblings, who could say? Perhaps one winter, he had seen a young man wrapped in a white fox fur coat enjoying the snow, making him feel even more ashamed. 

Or perhaps he had long admired that woman and merely exchanged glances one day. Though she had said nothing, her unintentional gaze had spoken volumes.

None of this was strange; Yushi did not care what the truth was. What truly amused him was that at that moment, he could see Lu Jianxin’s genuine gratitude, admiration, and fear directed towards him, along with a determination to gamble everything, even his life. Lu Jianxin was clearly willing to act on a fleeting impulse to eliminate all his long-standing grievances. The barbaric lands needed more of these extreme and pitiable souls.

These individuals were likely to become what the young man in wooden clogs referred to as the “filling the tombs of Confucianism.” Mr. Zhou once joked that the Righteous Lands had too many scholars who loved to adopt false moralities while being true villains. They genuinely believed that their hypocritical demeanor was invisible to the world, but in truth, that was far from the case. Some were angry yet silent year after year, while others dreamed of becoming such people, thus digging their own graves. It was no wonder that many had come to fill in the graves.

Suddenly, Yushi raised his head.

A great omen filled the heavens, rapidly spreading from a distance. It was undoubtedly the immense aura of an ascendant being.

Otherwise, it would not have been possible for Yushi to clearly sense such a profound energy here.

A woman with scarlet eyes appeared beside Yushi, softly saying, “Young Master, please temporarily leave this place. The Yu Guizong’s Xun Yuan was first intercepted and killed by me and Yang Zhi, then pursued by Xiao Xuan, and has now entered that hidden marine realm, completely shattered. There’s no escape left for him. Xun Yuan is now projected at the Eastern Sea, intending to split Tongye Continent, which may very well affect this place.”

Yushi shook his head, “You only need to protect me and Xian Zao; I want to see how Xun Yuan plans to split Tongye Continent.”

The great demon Yang Zhi nodded.

Yushi furrowed his brow and asked, “What about Xiao Xuan?”

The great demon replied, “That secret realm is very peculiar, as if Xun Yuan was lured away to another world. It’s possible that this time, Xun Yuan’s escape was a deliberate diversion to lead Xiao Xuan away.”

She suddenly vanished, returning moments later with a slightly changed expression. “Xiao Xuan has finally drawn his sword.”

Yushi looked up at the sky. Above the Eastern Sea of Tongye Continent, a rift in the celestial canopy opened, as Xiao Xuan broke through another sky with his sword, allowing him to “ascend” back to the Righteous Lands. He then directed a magnificent sword light toward the towering projection of Xun Yuan, the momentum rivaling Bai Ye’s first strike on Fuyou Continent.

That unparalleled sword light intertwined with water, fire, and thunder.

The great demon Yang Zhi looked up, softly saying, “That old fellow is doomed.”

Yushi chuckled, “Compared to you, Xun Yuan isn’t really that old.”

Yang Zhi smiled slightly and said, “I’ll go and grab a few pieces of glass-like golden bodies for you.”

Yushi was about to shake his head when Yang Zhi had already darted off. After all, as a major demon, he could not casually reprimand or obstruct her.

Moreover, Yang Zhi had also quietly warned him to “be careful.”

Yushi remained expressionless as he strolled leisurely within the noble residence.

Suddenly, the flow of time around Yushi seemed to freeze inexplicably.

Yet Yushi felt no fear; the robe he wore was a gift from Yang Zhi, capable of withstanding several strikes from a celestial sword cultivator without him dying.

Moreover, should Yushi’s robe encounter any spells or flying swords, as long as Yang Zhi wasn’t a continent away, she could arrive in an instant.

Yushi turned to see a handsome young man in a golden robe, casually tossing the black dragon that was thrashing wildly but unable to escape from the yellow pouch.

The young man glanced at Yushi’s robe and smiled, “It’s rare to see something I desire, but my life is worth more.”

Yushi clasped his hands together, “I see you, Sect Master Jiang.”

Jiang Shangzhen raised a hand and waved lightly, “No need for such courtesy; it’s not every day a father reunites with his son. Just call me father. Remember to have that little servant Fei Fei massage and knead my shoulders, and you’ll have made up for some filial duty.”

Yushi was taken aback, laughing silently for a moment before asking, “What about that young man protected by the black dragon?”

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, “Oh, him? His soul has exchanged places with a handsome young man. I reckon when the flow of time returns to normal, he’ll be quite confused, wondering who he is and where he is, and what he should do.”

Yushi inquired, “Aren’t you going to save Xun Yuan, instead of chatting with me here?”

“Why save someone far away when you’re so close and haven’t killed? When I, Jiang, become clever, I often don’t even know what I’m thinking. How could you foresee that?” 

Jiang Shangzhen pouted, “Besides, this wild son of mine is nothing but a little useless; Fei Fei, that wretched girl, actually had the gall to gift you her precious robe. I’m too timid; killing you for a sword isn’t worth it, so I’ll just be satisfied with this half-immortal-grade yellow pouch I picked up.”

Yushi remained silent.

This robe had one of its abilities to “lock swords,” making it more mysterious than Du Mao’s sword-swallowing boat.

Yushi had long wanted to use himself as bait to provoke Jiang Shangzhen’s renowned sword, which was said to be able to “slice through immortals with a willow leaf.”

Jiang Shangzhen tucked the yellow pouch into his sleeve, and the frozen flow of time resumed its normal pace.

Yushi asked, “Why don’t you look for that She Yue or Dou Kou?”

One was among the ten young talents of several continents, while the other was a potential candidate.

The key was that they were unlike Yushi and his companions; they did not have a major demon as their protector.

Jiang Shangzhen smiled nonchalantly.

In a study, a handsome young man in elaborate clothing was locked in a struggle with Lu Jianxin. Without the protection of the black dragon, relying solely on strength, he could easily defeat Han Chengyi, the young master of the Han family, who was currently suffering from a beating that left him bloodied, regretting not having sought out that beautiful woman first. 

Lu Jianxin, fueled by his rage, relentlessly pummeled the “young master,” tears streaming down his face, his gaze exceptionally fierce as he cursed in a foreign voice, squeezing the neck of the “young master.”

Jiang Shangzhen smiled and said, “Alright, Sister Fei Fei, no need to hide anymore. You’re all grown up and beautiful; why not show yourself?”

Fei Fei unexpectedly stepped out from within Yushi’s robe, speaking to him, “Young Master, it’s just an illusion created by a secret technique, akin to the Nascent Soul level. Jiang Shangzhen’s true self isn’t here.”

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “Of course. I never act unless I’m completely certain. If I’m not confident, I wouldn’t dare to kill me. I came here just to greet you two. Remember, whenever Sister Fei Fei wears that robe again, Young Master Yushi should obediently hide in the military tent; otherwise, it’s natural for me to beat my son.”

As Jiang Shangzhen’s illusion dissipated, the yellow pouch remained, as he was not foolish enough to let it leave with him. He had merely been teasing Yushi.

The latest disciple of the Yu Guizong, who might also be its last leader, felt a tinge of melancholy as he turned his gaze toward the Eastern Sea, where the golden body of an ascendant cultivator began to shatter. Even as the scene became magnificent, it was ultimately a reminder of the truth that living was better than dying.

Jiang Shangzhen muttered, “Cursing that old, immortal bastard for so many years, it’s genuinely painful to lose him. It’ll be difficult to ask for a curse after he’s gone.”

Jiang Shangzhen was left with only a head, as the remaining illusion overlooked the strange pair of master and servant, smiling, “New and old accounts must be settled. One involves bullying my woman, and the other involves plotting against Xun Yuan. In the future, Jiang will take his time to settle the score with you two; I’ll exhaust myself in the process.”

As the frost falls, the sun descends into the earth, and the yin energy begins to condense. The autumn dryness causes damage to fluids, so it’s best to guard against the cold outside and clear heat within.

Thus, there arose a custom of eating persimmons after a light rain, said to strengthen bones and prevent chapped lips in winter.

Under a persimmon tree adorned with bright red fruits like hanging lanterns, in the misty sky, dark branches contrasted with the vivid red, creating a festive atmosphere.

A young girl, appearing around seventeen or eighteen years old, with a slightly plump figure and round cheeks, was dressed in cotton clothing. She stood on tiptoe, straightened her back, and wielded a stick she had found to knock down several persimmons from the tree. After tossing aside the stick, she bent down to gather the bright red fruits in her coat.

Finally, she squatted in front of a county boundary monument, munching on a persimmon while examining the carved inscription, which read, “Established by the officials, Yongning County Boundary.” To the left were some small characters indicating the country and year.

She thought it was impressive that such a stone, which passersby wouldn’t spare a glance, could define the territory of neighboring regions.

In her hometown, it wasn’t like that. There were no such regulations, nor could they afford to care. Fights were too fierce, tempers too short, making it easy to lose everything.

After arriving here, she had traveled extensively, collecting coins made of gold, silver, and bronze from various countries, as well as books from various schools of thought. She found everything appealing, and in the war-torn cities, the more doors there were to wealthy families, the more likely they were to have been lost, making it easy to gather items once thought valuable, even easier than knocking down persimmons.

Currently, the Northern regions of Tongye Continent were actually more unstable than the south.

The celestial sects of Tongye Continent were relatively few compared to the nine continents of the Righteous Lands, with more significant mountains and fewer celestial beings. In any extensive territory, it remained quite challenging for common mortals to seek out immortals, much easier to encounter an emperor.

Many small nations in the increasingly impoverished and spiritually barren regions of Tongye Continent were, in the chaos, less prone to calamity. Even if there were a few so-called celestial beings with some knowledge, they were eager to abandon their mountains, taking their ancestral halls with them in haste, leaving no concern for others. Once ascended, they would cut ties, roam freely, and enjoy the essence of nature without many worries.

If she hadn’t preferred wandering and wasn’t coveting military achievements, treasures, and auspicious locations, perhaps the people of Yongning County would have waited several decades to encounter an outsider like her.

She came from far away yet was not merely an outsider. 

Having finished the persimmons, she picked up a branch, stood up, leaned against the boundary monument, and lightly scraped the mud off the soles of her shoes.

Earlier, outside the county’s literary temple, perhaps due to the frost-fall season, officials led a group of scholars in reciting blessings, whether plowing or weaving, to stave off wind and rain. “May the children and grandchildren prosper, for I am the granary…” 

In any case, she couldn’t understand, having only learned some of the grand dialect of the Righteous Lands. Furthermore, she couldn’t speak the elegant dialect of Tongye Continent and knew nothing of the various official languages and dialects. She simply observed the officials and scholars, gathering to petition for the people, which looked quite similar to what they were doing. Only that official wearing the official garb seemed a bit too portly, with a rosy complexion that made his neck nearly invisible. Shouldn’t learned men be lean like Mr. Zhou?

A group of children riding bamboo horses passed by, playacting a wedding. 

When they caught sight of the woman standing by the stone, they exchanged a few glances but paid her no mind, for she looked unremarkable.

She continued her solitary wander.

Following the traces of spiritual energy, she finally spotted a celestial sect, a small one, not commonly seen in Tongye Continent. 

However, it seemed that the cultivators of that sect were out, so she did not visit. Ultimately, between the two mountain peaks, hundreds of miles away, the fog swirled like a creek flowing gently. There were celestial cultivators setting up a magical net, aiming to catch a type of bird, akin to fishing in the valley, scaring the birds into the net. Several wind-riding cultivators kept startling the bird flocks, while those lower-tier cultivators, unable to ride the wind, kept running through the mountains, creating noise to frighten the birds.

The young woman in cotton clothing sat quietly on a low tree branch, observing the scene.

It seemed that after the barbaric lands arrived at Tongye Continent, it mirrored this scene, with startled birds constantly flying into the net.

Yet she wondered whether those celestial beings, who had once regarded the kings of the earth as mere puppets, would envy those lowly mountain ants when death approached.

They probably wouldn’t care; in an instant of life and death, even those so-called enlightened beings would likely be left in confusion.

She suddenly wished to find someone to chat with, not necessarily someone who spoke the language of the barbaric lands, but at least someone who could speak the grand dialect of the Central Earth, which was now difficult to come by. Small towns’ City God Temples and Water Gods’ shrines were of no use; they would likely only speak the dialects of Tongye Continent. Unfortunately, those scholars from the academies either died on the battlefield or retreated to the Yuguizong and Tongye Sect. The elite from great dynasties’ Five Mountains were certainly dead, and the merchant’s children were exceptionally nimble, proficient in both earning money and avoiding disaster, making them hard to catch.

As for the upper-tier cultivators, she once fortuitously encountered one hiding deep in the mountains who had not established a sect. He was what the Righteous Lands called a hermit. When she met him, she ignored him, mainly because she was too lazy to act, as she had previously visited a not-too-large celestial estate where a Golden Core and Nascent Soul Earth Immortal were stationed. The conversation had not gone well, and she ended up killing them with a single punch. 

It wasn’t much; during her early landing days, she had also killed a Jade Core cultivator without a second thought.

A group of young men and women practicing their lower-tier breathing techniques slowly descended the mountain. One female cultivator held freshly picked chrysanthemums, as frost had killed a hundred flowers, leaving only this flourishing grass.

The young woman in cotton clothing propped her hands on the tree branch, showing little interest in those female cultivators. Instead, she focused on the chrysanthemums, her thoughts wandering. She had heard that there was a place in the Righteous Lands called the Hundred Flowers Blessed Land, and among the flower gods, it seemed that this flower god held a high position. It had many elegant names, all quite melodious, such as Frost Petals and Smiling Blossoms, while the names like Sun Essence and Week’s Weaving sounded rather odd. The young woman preferred such chaotic matters, having always found the Righteous Lands filled with intriguing things, which was why she had come to explore.

The earlier reason she had “returned to the mortal realm from the heavens” in the barbaric lands and then arrived at Tongye Continent was due to the great demon Lotus Flower Temple Master, who had been killed by Dong San with a sword. After all, in a sense, she considered herself a neighbor of the Lotus Flower Temple Master. Of course, saying “neighbor” was somewhat exaggerated, as they were actually quite far apart. In the barbaric lands, three months could feel like suspended time, but the distance between two bright moons was merely an illusion of proximity. Occasionally, only someone named Yao Jia would visit her home.

Those young men and women walking through the mountains spoke of how “the moonlit autumn clouds had fallen into the water, setting fire to the cold stream and turning it to ash.” Their verses, some borrowed from books and some self-composed, were echoed among them.

The young woman understood nothing, feeling a bit vexed. In the past, she would have endured it; after all, she was just a passerby, but just as she thought to find someone to talk to, she felt irritated. In a fit of irritation, she habitually clapped her face with both hands, making a significant noise that caught the attention of some young cultivators, whose gazes turned unfriendly. Some regarded her as a petty thief, while others dismissed her for her unremarkable appearance, but the ones who looked at her as if she were a flying bird caught in a net angered her the most.

However, when she finally spotted a round-faced little girl staring at her with wide, curious eyes, the young woman grinned broadly, feeling quite pleased. Despite the language barrier, she raised her arm to wave at the little girl, greeting her.

The little girl quickly waved energetically, and when her seniors and older siblings glanced her way, she immediately tucked her hands behind her back, looking up at the sky.

Seeing the round-faced girl made the young woman smile, for there was nothing cuter than that.

The group ultimately did not say anything, oblivious to the narrow escape they had made from the gates of death, and returned to the mountain.

The young woman leaned against the tree branch, grinning, “So you’re Jiang Shangzhen?”

A man standing on a tree branch smiled and nodded, “Sister She Yue, with your round face, you look extremely beautiful. So I changed my mind.”

The young woman continued gazing into the distance, saying, “I’m not someone you can just kill at will. Why provoke me?”

Jiang Shangzhen sat beside her, waiting for the moonlight to descend upon the mortal realm. He asked, “Have you ever seen someone named Liu Cai, the sword cultivator who raises the most sword gourds? Mr. Zhou mentioned that apart from his heartfelt emotions and immediacy, this fellow has a long list of lower-tier sword gourds.”

Mr. Zhou wanted her to find Liu Cai, but she need not concern herself with other matters.

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, “I know him.”

He turned his head.

Jiang Shangzhen continued to smile and said, “Unfortunately, he doesn’t know me. Sister She Yue, let’s not talk about Liu Cai, but about my brother. Since we both have nothing to do, I can invite you for a drink.”

She turned her head back, “Don’t bother me; go bother someone else.”

Jiang Shangzhen sighed, “I’m about to be driven mad by all of Tongye Continent; who else can I complain to?”

She replied, “Then just go die.”

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled, “Sister She Yue, you’re genuinely good at conversation, so we should chat more.”

Gradually, the moon rose over the willow treetops, and the moonlight shimmered like water, filling the world.

The round-faced girl clapped her cheeks, and Jiang Shangzhen smiled slightly before taking his leave. 

She slowly stood up, wondering why Mr. Zhou placed such importance on that Golden Core sword cultivator.

Her expression shifted slightly as she took to the winds, ascending to the celestial canopy. Using her innate magical ability, she vaguely saw the distant celestial canopy of Baoping Continent, where multiple depressions appeared like great pits, rippling with waves. Ultimately, ancient deities emerged from the gaps, although they were suppressed by the heavens and their golden forms shrank considerably, they still bore the grandeur of the Five Mountains. Meanwhile, on the ground of Baoping Continent, it seemed a great sun was rising, its light excessively blinding, causing the round-faced girl to feel irritable, wishing she could stretch her hand to press that sun back into the earth.

In an instant, a willow leaf silently arrived at her brow.

She disappeared in a flash, reappearing on a mountain peak thousands of miles away, her soul and physical form reconstituting seamlessly, even her cotton clothing and boots remained intact.

Moreover, Jiang Shangzhen’s sudden sword strike had seemingly not irked her; her mind remained deeply immersed in the strange phenomena occurring in Baoping Continent, leaving her standing at the mountaintop in a daze.

Jiang Shangzhen appeared beside her, clad in a golden robe, his sleeves billowing. Inside the golden robe, it seemed he wore several layers of robes. He apologetically said, “Sister-in-law, it’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.”

And then another willow leaf pierced through his brow.

The round-faced girl once again coalesced in another location, finally beginning to frown as she noticed many “Jiang Shangzhen” waiting nearby, “Are you really going to persist?”

“Good dogs fear the stick; good women fear the persistent suitor,” Jiang Shangzhen said, his hands tucked into his sleeves, eyes narrowed in a smile. “Since the old saying doesn’t work, and Sister She Yue shows no hint of romantic feelings, Jiang Da Ge can only act against his conscience, daring to destroy flowers.”

She replied, “Do as you wish. Sect Master Jiang’s happiness is what matters.”

After six successive strikes, Jiang Shangzhen chased after the moonlight, traversing thousands of miles. Ultimately, he stood beside the young woman, reluctantly retracting the willow leaf, pinching it between his fingers, “Forget it, forget it; indeed, I can't do anything to you, girl.”

One by one, the figures of Jiang Shangzhen, each wearing different robes and carrying various treasures, continually merged with the person beside Sister She Yue.

Then, in a deep ravine three thousand miles away, a sword light struck amidst a pool of moonlight.

Sister She Yue finally surfaced from the water, in a small pond, her round face evoking the vastness of the ocean under the bright moon.

Blood seeped from the corners of her mouth, and she fixed her gaze on the man standing by the pond’s edge, her expression dark as she said, “Jiang Shangzhen, are you really willing to damage the Dao?”

The one who drew his sword was none other than Jiang Shangzhen’s true self.

Jiang Shangzhen had been hunted many times; he had the skills to escape each time.

Certainly, he wasn’t just playing around; glancing into the distance, he withdrew his gaze and whispered to her, then laughed heartily as his form dissipated.

(The chapter ends here.)

 **Chapter 831: The White Clouds Send Liu Sixteen Back to the Mountains**

On a bustling stone arch bridge, wild grass thrived in the crevices of the blue stone slabs. 

A royal tomb, neglected for only a few years, had become a desolate sight, with foxes and rabbits scurrying about. 

Strange creatures from the mountains and marshes left their hidden caves in droves, rampaging through the streets below, brazenly shouting outside the Martial and Literary Temples and the City God Shrine, showing no fear at all. 

A king lay drunken in the embrace of a beauty, murmuring repeatedly that the fault was not his. The woman gently caressed the face of the man in the dragon robe. Earlier, in the grand hall, the military generals had looked pale while the civil officials jointly suggested that the king leave the city to present the imperial seal. 

During the previous Xiaoyuan Festival, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the Water Officer had performed rituals to avert misfortune. Normally, there would be customs of burning incense branches, offering gold and silver packages, and releasing prayer lanterns. However, this year, no one burned the incense or the gold and silver packages, nor did anyone release the prayer lanterns. 

In a hidden chamber, a father and son, both serving as Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior respectively, consoled themselves as the elder, a cultured leader of the nation, insisted that there must be a solution. “It makes no sense to completely eradicate us; they can't possibly leave nothing behind.” 

In a county town, a theater stood adjacent to a village school, where the old Confucian had always despised students attending performances by painted-faced actresses. Yet, that night, as darkness fell, the old scholar sat on a bench alongside the children, listening to the ghostly sounds of the play. 

In a remote little nation untouched by war, there was a Taoist temple built on a cliff, accessible only by a winding mountain path. 

A scholar in a Confucian robe led a young-looking sword cultivator up the mountain, as if they were visiting a small temple embedded in the cliffside. This place had been a temporary resting spot for a so-called "True Man of Taiping Mountain," who had taken in an unnamed disciple years ago. The incense had wafted there for ages, but it was ultimately a casual, heartless act, and the disciple had never amounted to much. As a practitioner of the Dao, he had aged over a hundred years, becoming frail and weak, with a few successors even less capable than he. It could be said that each generation had outdone the last in mediocrity. The old Taoist still likely had no idea who the "young" master in the ancestral hall portrait really was. 

The scholar and the sword cultivator traveled together without much purpose. The scholar had just returned from the Tongye Sect, while the sword cultivator had been stationed nearby and suggested this outing to clear their minds.

Not long ago, three great demons had plotted in Tongye Continent, with the one who successfully became the true disciple of Taiping Mountain receiving the most credit. When a young man from the Fuyi Sect exposed their scheme, it forced him to act prematurely, seemingly ruining their plans. Yet in the long run, this proved to be an accidental stroke of luck. Unfortunately, he had not been able to team up with the white ape to kill Zhong Kui. Since he had now gone missing, it was most likely due to some trickery from the old Taoist of the temple, and thus he would help gather whatever remaining incense offerings he could in the vast world. 

The scholar said, “You shouldn’t have killed her. It doesn’t matter if you kill a few from the Jade Purity realm, but this one was not meant to die. You even had to protect a whole Jade Zhi Ridge for her sake.” 

The sword cultivator replied, “Sir, I couldn’t help it when I saw her begging like a beggar.” 

The scholar laughed in anger, “If this were Feiran saying such things, I wouldn’t be surprised, but hearing it from you, it just doesn’t sit well.” 

The sword cultivator nodded, “Things went too smoothly in Tongye Continent, and I got a bit carried away.” 

The scholar continued, “The upheaval at Jade Zhi Ridge could have been a turning point for Tongye Continent, implying that the mountains and rivers of the entire region could gradually shift from chaos to order. Then I could help record your merit in the Jiazhi ledger. If I had known earlier, I should have thrown you over to Taiping Mountain to help your fellow disciples protect the path, so we wouldn’t have lost two. Including you, it’s not that you couldn’t die, it’s just that dying too early would be a waste of talent; you haven’t even had the chance to realize your ambitions with all you’ve learned.” 

Though saddened by the deaths of two of their fellow disciples, the elder brother, Shoucheng, felt no guilt at all. 

The scholar was Zhou Mi, and the sword cultivator was Shoucheng. They were a master and disciple pair. 

Zhou Mi walked the narrow path with his disciple Shoucheng and could already see the small temple ahead. 

People of the Dao observed the stars and the moon, and thus temples were commonly built on mountain peaks. 

Zhou Mi did not rush to enter the temple with its tightly shut doors but instead gazed out at the mountains and rivers with Shoucheng. He chuckled softly, “A person who has seen the sun, moon, and rivers, only to lose their sight, suffers more than a young blind person.” 

Shoucheng discerned the underlying meaning in his master’s words. 

A person who has lost something only comes to treasure what they currently have even more. Therefore, as long as the survivors on Tongye Continent plan things well in the wild world ahead, they won’t thank the vast world that has brought them all this. Most will secretly rejoice, grateful that the wild world has shown them some leniency, while they will continue to harbor hatred for the Confucian temples in the central lands, blaming them for all the suffering on Tongye Continent, and will despise all other continents that have not been affected by war. 

A young temple acolyte swaggered over to the two, bowed with respect, and in the local dialect, asked the scholar why he had come. 

The acolyte was about seven or eight years old, his tone filled with arrogance. He bowed at the door as if he had learned proper etiquette from his master and felt it unnecessary to be polite to two mundane scholars who would soon decay. 

Their master, the old temple master, was a divine being at the Sea Observation level, rarely meeting his match in the nation, and wherever he went, he would be respectfully called a celestial being or a true man. The master had mentioned in private that this ancestor was just two steps away from what was known as “Earth Immortal” in Daoist texts. 

These two mundane visitors from the mountains below—what did it matter if they were wealthy or well-born? After all, they were still just people from the foot of the mountain coming to see someone from above. 

Zhou Mi glanced at the little acolyte and turned to smile, “What a stroke of luck! To find something without even looking, it seems the timing and the Dao of Tongye Continent are truly on our side. Shoucheng, did you notice anything unusual?” 

Shoucheng looked confused, “Please enlighten me, sir.” 

Zhou Mi took hold of the acolyte’s arm and gently tapped his wrist with two fingers. The acolyte lifted onto his toes, like a chick being picked up, and for some reason, whether out of instinct or submissiveness, he refrained from cursing the scholar. 

Shoucheng focused intently and saw that after his master used his abilities on the young acolyte, faint glimmers of light flickered in the child’s palm before quickly vanishing into thin air. 

The acolyte’s hand had appeared as if it had been dipped in ink, now washed but still holding some remnants. 

Zhou Mi released the acolyte's wrist and asked, “Has this temple ever had a Taoist named Liu Cai who went down the mountain to wander? When he left, did he bring along a few gourds of various sizes?” 

The acolyte rubbed his wrist, stepping back nervously, “How do you know about that? But we don’t have a Liu Cai here, just a local fool nicknamed Liu Woodhead. He can do any odd jobs, from fishing to hunting to chopping wood. Whatever can make money, he’ll do it. According to my master, if there were a nunnery on the mountain, he could even sell rouge and powders there. That fool comes to our temple every now and then to swindle money; he’s quite a big patron of ours. My master hasn’t bothered with him in recent years. The last time he came to the temple, he brought a basket of pine torches and a few large fish, not asking for any copper coins or silver but rummaging through the storeroom for some old gourds that had gathered dust for years, claiming he’d use them as currency. I watched him curiously as he picked up all those worthless things, one by one, and held them up to his ear, shaking and swaying.” 

What was referred to as the storeroom of the temple was actually just a shed where old junk was piled. 

Zhou Mi cast a glance at the small temple and chuckled, “Everything is interconnected. Truly a remarkable person.” 

Shoucheng asked in thought, “Sir, are Liu Cai’s ‘Heart’s Concerns’ and ‘Immediate’ sword-raising gourds, sourced from here?” 

Zhou Mi shook his head, “Liu Cai had the two sword-raising gourds first; only then did he acquire those two ‘life-bound flying swords.’ Otherwise, the founding ancestor of this temple, as someone at the upper level, wouldn’t be so blind as not to see the quality of the sword-raising gourds. Moreover, he had a penchant for collecting them, so what truly made it unclear for him to distinguish between genuine and fake, depth and shallowness, should be those two strange flying swords.” 

What followed from the scholar’s words made Shoucheng’s expression grow serious. 

“That temple’s big patron is likely Liu Cai’s disciple and protector, because Liu Cai who came to this temple was merely a wandering spirit of his yin form; his real body might not even be on Tongye Continent.” 

Shoucheng asked, “Does sir want to find Liu Cai, not just to have him counter Chen Pingan, but also to meet this ‘patron’?” 

Zhou Mi sighed, “In this world, the arts of yin and yang are evolving, and one person monopolizes half the territory.” 

At the ancestral mountain of the Yuguizong, on the Divine Inscription Peak. 

The old sect master, Xun Yuan, had died a valiant death in battle. A great cultivator at the Ascension level, his glass-like body shattered into fragments scattered across the heavens and earth, mostly intercepted by the great demons. 

The current sect master, Jiang Shangzhen, had proven he was still alive and lively by appearing in the human realm with a stunning glance. 

However, the situation had collapsed. A celestial being without the protection of the heavens found it difficult to support a collapsing building. 

The master of Jiuyi Peak, Wei Ying, who had originally had a better chance of succeeding Jiang Shangzhen as sect master, had gone to Baoping Continent to serve as a subordinate sect master, temporarily working for the Da Li Song clan, and would be unable to return to Yuguizong. 

The old patriarch glanced at the chair opposite him, then at the two empty chairs beneath the ancestral hall portrait. 

Jiang Shangzhen had moved from the opposite seat to below the portrait. 

It was painful to look at for too long. 

He glanced at the moonlight outside the main door. 

A deity in charge of the Yuguizong’s finances, Tian Cai Di Bao, named Song Shengtang, exclaimed in anger, “Why is our sect master Jiang still wandering outside? Are we to watch our sect members die day by day? What’s the point of drawing swords if we don’t help our own mountain?” 

Calling Jiang Shangzhen “sect master” felt a little excessive—it was not merely dropping the surname “Jiang” from “sect master.” This was a subtle stance. 

Jiang Shangzhen had not genuinely won over the Yuguizong’s ancestral hall. 

However, one significant reason for such an awkward situation was the previous existence of the old sect master, Xun Yuan. 

Moreover, the Jiang clan’s control of the Cloud Cave blessed land had always been akin to a fiefdom within the Yuguizong, which irked many. Thus, Zhao Shengtang and Jiang Shangzhen had always been at odds; whenever the Divine Inscription Peak’s ancestral hall convened, it was famously a case of dogs biting dogs, yet Jiang Shangzhen always came out on top, even giving Zhao Shengtang the nickname, “Bald Old Dog Zhao.” 

An older ancestor, Liu Huamao, who bore a deep grudge against Jiang Shangzhen, sat near the main door. Her talent was not exceptional, having relied on spending a vast amount of celestial money and precious resources in her early years to barely reach the upper level. 

Jiang Shangzhen almost always initiated conversations with Liu Huamao during meetings. 

“Sister Liu, what a lovely name, full of grace and beauty, perpetually eighteen, and her face like today’s.” 

Under such dire circumstances, Liu Huamao had to force herself to say a word of truth to Jiang Shangzhen, “It’s certain that some great demon is watching over here, responsible for killing Jiang Shangzhen. There may not just be one old beast lying in wait.” 

There was no way she would call him sect master. 

Her reasoning was that when she was young, being close to the water’s edge, she wanted to explore the Cloud Cave blessed land. As for cultivating the Dao, that was just a side endeavor. 

However, Jiang Shangzhen, who was then the young lord of the Cloud Cave blessed land, had stealthily attached himself to a woman from the blessed land with some strange method, and when he and Liu Huamao met, they hit it off and called each other sisters. Afterward, they traveled together, and during one visit to a place called Furong Pu in the Cloud Cave blessed land, under the pleasant moonlight, the girl shyly began to undress, turning red as a tomato. Liu Huamao playfully teased her a few times and pinched the “girl’s” tender cheeks. 

Looking back, it was a tragic and calamitous memory. 

After that, Liu Huamao began to practice frantically, aiming to catch up to Jiang Shangzhen’s level, hoping to find an excuse to severely injure that bastard. 

Unfortunately, along the path of cultivation, talent, roots, and temperament all played a role, and there would always be someone better; Jiang Shangzhen, recognized as the next peak master of Jiuyi Peak, didn’t seem to be particularly diligent in his cultivation but always surpassed her by two levels. 

After she had caught up to him by one level, Jiang Shangzhen met her and, after flattering her for a while, turned around and left. Not long after, he broke through. 

There was an interesting dynamic in the Yuguizong ancestral hall meetings. 

Those who spoke more and had louder voices were less related to their realms; it was simply about who got along worse with Jiang Shangzhen. 

Over time, Liu Huamao, with her mediocre talent at the Jade Purity level, gained unexpected weight in the meetings at Divine Inscription Peak’s ancestral hall. 

In contrast, the older celestial beings, who were of a higher generation and had the same status as the old sect master Xun Yuan, had high levels of cultivation, but because they never got into heated arguments with Jiang Shangzhen and preferred to mediate, they were often overlooked when discussing important matters. 

“Did you ever even curse Jiang Shangzhen? Did you ever throw a chair at him?” How could you claim to be wholeheartedly for the sect? 

The old patriarch of the law had a heavy heart as he lightly tapped the armrest of his chair. “When the times change, the advantages and disadvantages shift; the old sect master shouldn’t have appeared.” 

With the protection of the Three Yuans and Four Symbols Great Formation, although Xun Yuan had only recently entered the Ascension realm, benefiting from the timing and location, his cultivation appeared flawless at the peak of the upper level. When Taiping Mountain and the Fuyi Sect fell one after the other, the formation dissipated, and he was immediately reverted to his original form. 

The old heavenly lord of Taiping Mountain, fighting to the death, wielded the Bright Moon Mirror and had once slain a great sword immortal from the wild world with a flying sword from the grand formation. 

As for the Taoists of Taiping Mountain, their achievements in slaying demons were numerous and unmatched across the continent. 

The Fuyi Sect’s master, Ji Hai, managed to sustain himself in the Jade Purity realm until after Taiping Mountain’s destruction, which was already a remarkable feat. 

The Yuguizong’s accomplishments mostly stemmed from Xun Yuan and Jiang Shangzhen. 

Ascension realm Xun Yuan had slain two celestial beings and a Jade Purity realm sword immortal. 

As for Jiang Shangzhen, with his east and west swords, he had unconsciously killed four Jade Purity realm cultivators, along with a large number of earth immortal demon clan members as a bonus. 

Song Shengtang wondered, “How did Xiao Qian go from being a hidden official at the Sword Qi Great Wall to a key figure in the wild world?” 

The patriarch of the law sneered, “Why does it matter? What’s important is that she shows signs of being aligned with the wild world, and she herself is an Ascension realm sword cultivator. Tongye Continent is now under the wild world’s domain. If Xiao Qian strikes next time with her sword, and it’s not just random punching, who can stop her from challenging the sword?” 

A less experienced elder sitting near the door said softly, “The Tongye Sect still has that sword immortal by its side.” 

The Yuguizong cultivators had a decent impression of the second disciple from the Confucian School. 

A flying sword for sending messages hovered at the entrance of the ancestral hall. The patriarch stretched out his hand to grab it, and after reading the confidential letter, his expression darkened. 

Liu Huamao asked anxiously, “What’s wrong?” 

The patriarch spoke in a deep voice, “Zhou Mi has personally appeared in the Tongye Sect’s territory and made a huge promise. As long as the Tongye Sect removes the protective formation of the Wutong Tiansan, they will be allowed to establish their own dominion. Not only that, but he will also provide them with a thousand years of protection from him and the Tuo Moon Mountain. Furthermore, the new sect master of the Tongye Sect will become the lord of a new military camp. The Tongye Sect will only nominally become a vassal of the future master of the entire continent, while everything else will remain the same. The wild world is even willing to send two great sword immortals, including Shoucheng, to serve as patrons and guest officials for the Tongye Sect. Moreover, these two will have no say in the ancestral hall discussions and must strike for the Tongye Sect three times instead.” 

Liu Huamao asked, “What about the sword immortal by their side?” 

The patriarch of the law replied helplessly, “Tongye Sect cultivators need not feel pressured; there’s no need to drive the sword immortal away from the sect. As long as they remove the mountain water formation, they can choose to observe when the sword immortal strikes.” 

Liu Huamao frowned, “But that would isolate the sword immortal!” 

To the Tongye Sect, the sword immortal was already an outsider; previously, they had relied on the sword to protect the sect, which had helped unify the hearts of the cultivators, making them willing to lay down their lives. 

Zhou Mi's actions clearly aimed to turn the sword immortal against the entire Tongye Sect. 

Should they protect the Tongye Sect? If not, the mountains and waters’ fortune would be absorbed by the wild world. If they did protect it, and the Wutong Tiansan was removed, every time the sword immortal struck, it would stir unrest among the sect’s cultivators. 

Song Shengtang stroked his beard and squinted, “This is troublesome. A huge dilemma.” 

If it were them, it would indeed leave everyone feeling conflicted. 

Liu Huamao asked, “Who conveyed this information?” 

The patriarch of the law destroyed the confidential letter and said, “A young female cultivator named Yu Xin.” 

For a moment, the atmosphere in the Yuguizong ancestral hall lightened a bit. The patriarch laughed, “She is the reincarnation of our great ancestor who revitalized the sect.” 

Jiang Shangzhen was known for saying strange things, describing Du Mao as “a prodigal son of Tongye Continent and half the revitalizer of Yuguizong.” 

This remark became widely circulated in the Divine Inscription Peak’s ancestral hall, a well-accepted joke. 

After all, the animosity between the Yuguizong and the Tongye Sect was not a matter of one or two thousand years. It didn’t hurt to add one more grievance. 

If it had not been for this great upheaval, the Divine Inscription Peak’s ancestral hall would have discussed a plan to strike down the Tongye Sect, systematically eroding its foundation. This would align with Confucian principles while secretly harming them. 

Liu Huamao sighed, “If we’re not careful, this matter alone could bring her calamity.” 

The patriarch of the law said, “Then we’ll pretend we never saw this information. This is a matter of principle; no matter how the fates of the two sects unfold later, we should speak and act kindly regarding this Yu Xin, and if we have the chance, we can lend her a hand.” 

The old patriarch repeated, “If we have the chance.” 

Suddenly, the old man stood up, and soon everyone followed suit, walking out of the ancestral hall. Outside, they saw a young woman in a cotton coat, speaking in the refined dialect of Tongye Continent she had just learned, slowly saying that the Yuguizong need not surrender their sect, and that cultivators need not leave the mountain, only needing to hand over a Cloud Cave blessed land. 

A blue-robed swordsman named Chen Yin, tall and holding his sword at his back, had bought a black boat at the Peach Leaf Crossing. The usually graceful boatman, as adept in poetry as any scholar, had long since scattered and fled. 

The blue-robed swordsman had to row the boat himself. 

Now, among the cultured literati and dignitaries of the capital of the Great Qian Dynasty, who had the leisure to enjoy the scenery on a boat? 

Thus, this man was undoubtedly a foreign celestial master. 

The black boat at Peach Leaf Crossing was not the kind of small boat used in common water towns; it had a decoration resembling a stork carved on the prow, which piqued the blue-robed swordsman’s interest in rowing. 

He wore a jade pendant from the ancestral hall that read, “Ancestral Hall Continues the Incense,” and “Taiping Mountain Cultivator I.” 

This jade pendant was merely a trophy from a military camp, which he had taken. 

Feiran had a good impression of the Great Qian Dynasty, as it was replete with scenic spots and talented people, especially the elite cavalry and military strength stationed in various regions, which caught the attention of several military camps in central Tongye Continent. 

The overall situation in the lower regions of Tongye Continent was actually much better than the Jiazhi camp had anticipated. In short, the performance of the secular dynasty of Tongye Continent on the battlefield could be summed up in two words: terrible. 

The strong wind revealed the strength of the qing grass, further highlighting the excellence of the Great Qian Dynasty. However, wild grass was still wild grass; no matter how resilient, a great fire could reduce it to ashes. 

After all, the “timing” of Tongye Continent was now controlled by the Tuo Moon Mountain of the wild world. 

Feiran tossed away the bamboo stalk, and the black boat drifted forward by itself. 

However, today, the military camp in the southern capital was embroiled in fierce debates regarding the survival of the Liu clan of the Great Qian. One faction insisted on annihilating Shinjing City, slaughtering the city and establishing a capital, providing a warning to all the vassal states of Tongye Continent. They aimed to behead the princes and ministers, hanging their heads at the gates of every small nation to show the consequences of resisting. 

Another faction believed that the literati and martial artists of the Great Qian had many usable talents and the capital to support them. As long as they operated properly and established a puppet emperor, they would become a significant aid to the military camp. After all, the young emperor had abandoned his kingdom and emptied the treasury, fleeing to the Fifth Continent, which could be used to spread the news widely. 

All major cities in the Great Qian had already been placed under martial law, allowing only entry but no exit, to prevent civilians from fleeing, being secretly guided and exploited by the demon clan to break through defenses, potentially leading to national catastrophe. 

However, Feiran was not here to enjoy the mountains and rivers but to meet someone. 

The head of the Golden Summit Temple, Du Hanling, a cultivator of low realm, an Earth Immortal, was not a sword cultivator but had a sharp mind. 

The young boy at the Water Platform of the Yuanju School, when meeting Feiran, found his fate intertwined at that moment, originally hoping to follow Feiran to the mountains for cultivation, yet inexplicably ended up dead. 

In the former North Jin state, Lu Jianxin, who ultimately died at the hands of “himself,” encountered Yu Si, and if it weren’t for Jiang Shangzhen’s intervention, he would have had the opportunity to undergo a transformation, becoming the lord of a city; instead, he was attached to Yu Si, plus a pair of wooden clogs from his Daoist path, making them the two greatest protective charms, leaving him almost impossible to die. 

Feiran had been mulling over Zhou Mi’s words repeatedly: the Confucian academies and schools had given too much power to the secular dynasties, unwilling to use an iron fist to unify and restrain the hearts of the people. 

The three Confucian academies and seventy-two schools sounded numerous, but in the vast Tongye Continent, they were only three schools, including the Great Fu Academy. 

In the end, the Confucian temple still wanted to restrain the scholars and sages of the schools, forbidding them from interfering too much in court matters, and absolutely not allowing the scholars to act as the shadow emperors of various nations. 

As a result, each acted independently, with the mountains above being a world apart, the reclusive high beings disdaining the world, and many ministers and officials being nothing more than fame-seeking individuals, using false scholarship to crowd out true sages. The mountains above and below, various nations and places, were like scattered sand. 

Yet, Feiran was very curious about Zhou Mi’s founding teachings and their fundamental principles. 

How could one fundamentally change this predicament? 

The coexistence of the demon and human clans in the future was a monumental challenge. 

As for Zhou Mi’s true identity, Feiran had heard some rumors. 

Zhou Mi was indeed a pseudonym; he had once been a genuine scholar of the vast world. 

According to his senior brother Qie Yun, Zhou Mi had been a prodigy in his youth, with great knowledge. 

However, his learning had never been accepted by the Confucian temple. After a debate with someone, he became disheartened and chose to travel the wild world. 

This scholar had proposed a set of “Twelve Policies for Taiping” to the Confucian temple. 

First, a set of personal cultivation guidelines for all scholars should be established, roughly corresponding scholars, gentlemen, and sages to family, country, and world. 

All emperors and rulers of secular dynasties and vassal states must be disciples of Confucian academies; non-scholars cannot be national rulers. 

Every head of a school should be a royal tutor! 

Scholars and gentlemen should serve as national instructors. 

Whether it’s the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers or the Three Provinces and Six Ministries, these central and important officials should also be disciples of the academies. 

Every court should establish a position capable of ignoring palace constraints and responsible for documenting the merits and demerits of a nation’s rulers and ministers, serving as the academy’s three-year major evaluation. 

Second, all upper-level demon cultivators in the vast world should be exterminated; earth immortal demons should be expelled to the continent, with strict regulations. 

Once any demon cultivator enters the Dragon Gate realm, they must proactively report to the Confucian temple and各地書院, with their “true names” recorded in the files. 

These demon cultivators, upon entering the Golden Core realm, must assist local mountain and water deities, ensuring good weather for a century within their jurisdiction, particularly in eliminating mischievous creatures, similar to the role of a “county magistrate.” The academy would then evaluate their merits to see if they can be granted titles such as mountain chief or water fairy, or whether they must work for another century. Once promoted to mountain chief or water fairy, it would be akin to shifting from muddy waters to clear ones in the human realm, and their subsequent paths of promotion would be comparable to those of river water deities and mountain spirits. 

Third, three locations near the Suspended Mountain should be chosen to connect the southern Pusa Continent, southwestern Fuyun, and southeastern Tongye Continent, for example, the territory of the former Yu Long Sect. 

They should gradually station troops at the Sword Qi Great Wall, first relocating unsuitable mundane scholars among the local populace to the Yu Long Sect’s islands. Afterward, they should draw sword cultivators from Beiju Lu Continent to be stationed at the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

All cultivators who have committed grave crimes in the vast world can redeem their lives on the battlefield with their contributions. 

All mountain and wild cultivators can purchase mountain elixirs, manuals, and treasures with their war merits. They need not leave the city to fight; they can defend the walls during wars and work behind the scenes afterward, using the Sword Qi Great Wall as a fundamental base to continuously build cities towards the south, forcing the wild world to dispatch troops every thirty years. 

The Sword Qi Great Wall has unique geography, and the Qi cultivators are naturally oppressed compared to sword cultivators. Thus, a sufficient number of pure warriors should be cultivated. Although they are similarly suppressed by the Dao and pure sword intent, they differ from Qi cultivators; warriors can temper their bodies through this, and the threshold for warriors is lower than that for Qi cultivators. Ultimately, the Sword Qi Great Wall will have this kind of warring pattern: if you are not a sword cultivator, everyone else is a warrior. 

Apart from sword cultivators and pure warriors, many Qi cultivators will act more as assistants. 

Fourth, all celestial and Ascension realm great cultivators will be granted extra freedoms. 

These mountaintop figures need to contribute, but each type of contribution will yield greater returns. 

The Confucian temple will acknowledge their “superiority.” 

For instance, when heading to the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Confucian temple promises they need not fight to the death, and their fundamental principles won’t be harmed. They only need to do some embellishing things, such as expanding advantages in advantageous situations, or using non-essential items to defend against the great demon’s attacks, or setting up mountain and water formations to protect cities, city heads, and sword cultivators and warriors. 

Fifth, the Confucian temple will establish seventy-two Daoist schools in addition to the seventy-two academies across various continents and nations. 

Besides actively inspecting cultivation qualifications and accepting “tributes” from various nations’ courts each year, collecting seeds of cultivation from different regions, these Confucian scholars will primarily focus on military affairs, not engaging in superficial discussions but deeply understanding all historical contexts. 

The final assessment will be conducted in the constantly smoke-filled Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Sixth, the various teachings of the Hundred Schools of Thought will be divided into nine ranks, with both upward and downward adjustments, similar to official ranks. 

Those who refuse to comply will be expelled from the ranks, forbidden from studying, and all their books destroyed. The head of any family, the ancestor, will be imprisoned in the Confucian temple’s merit grove. 

Seventh, breaking the barriers between the mountain and the mundane world, one suggestion is to facilitate and entice them with benefits, promoting mountain cultivators to become celestial couples. 

Eighth, marginalizing the teachings of Buddhism and Daoism, banning all temples and monasteries, ensuring that Confucianism achieves true supremacy in the vast world. 

Ninth, focusing on supporting military, commerce, and arts. 

In addition, there are three more policies specifically targeting the distant neighboring worlds and ancient deities. 

Feiran sighed, gathering his complicated thoughts, muttering to himself, “Ultimately, Master Zhou proposed these twelve policies to consolidate power for the Confucian temple. To grant scholars greater freedom, paving the way for lasting peace.” 

At a ferry near Peach Leaf Crossing, two black boats met. 

Feiran frowned. It seemed that Du Hanling was not coming alone. 

The Earth Immortal cultivator was accompanied by a young Golden Core cultivator and a city god dressed in formal attire. 

Feiran merely frowned, while Du Hanling, along with his disciple Shao Yuanran and the city god of Qiche City, wore expressions as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight. Even Du Hanling, a person of his fierce nature, was shaken at the sight of Feiran, dressed in blue robes with a sword at his back and the jade pendant from Taiping Mountain hanging from his waist. He felt a sense of dread wash over him; could this truly be a coincidence? 

Two figures approached from the opposite side—Liu Cong of the Great Qian clan and Duke Gao Shizhen. Upon seeing “Feiran,” they nearly turned to flee. 

Feiran understood instantly and smiled. 

It seemed they all recognized the Hidden Official, and from the looks of it, their past interactions had not been pleasant. 

Thus, Feiran smiled and said, “The mountains and waters reunite; it’s been a long time.” 

White clouds drifted past the peak of the Languishing Mountain. The little girl in black, upon seeing them, waved her golden backpack and green bamboo staff vigorously, greeting them as a way of being hospitable. 

“Hey, hey, hey! I’m the right protector here, the water monster of the Mute Lake. I have two friends, one named Pei Qian and the other named Nuan Shu. Do you know them? Have you heard of them?” 

Today, the right protector of Languishing Mountain accompanied the left protector of Qilong Alley, who had never been promoted, one crouching and the other lying down, waiting together by the cliff for the white clouds to pass. 

The left protector of Qilong Alley was a small official, not comparable to his own big official. 

Haha, white clouds and azure skies. 

In the mountains, they feared Ruan Xiu, while on Languishing Mountain, they feared Pei Qian, but they really liked this little simpleton. 

He once accompanied Zhou Mi Li, squatting at the entrance of the school run by the Chen family in Longwei Creek, waiting for that “the most heroic” Pei Qian to finish classes and go home, often waiting for half a day. The little girl would chat with him for a long time. She would never be like Pei Qian, who would grab his mouth for no reason and twist it, asking what was going on. 

Little Mi Li longed for the white clouds to visit Languishing Mountain. 

She frowned, growing increasingly sad, thinking, what if when Pei Qian returns home, he’s already as tall as she and Sister Nuan Shu combined? What if one day the mountain master climbs the mountain with a basket, and in that basket stands a strange little girl? 

Mi Yu sat down beside the little girl. 

Zhou Mi Li clapped her hands and laughed as the white clouds passed through the valley. 

However, just as Mi Yu sat down, he immediately stood up, communicating with Wei Ban silently, then Mi Yu summoned his life-bound flying sword, “Xia Mantian,” and rode the sword toward the Ancestral Hall at Jise Peak. 

Eventually, at the entrance, Mi Yu encountered a scholar and a tall man. 

The sword-wielding scholar smiled slightly at Mi Yu, then vanished without a sound, crossing continents on a journey. 

His trip to Baoping Continent was merely to cover for a friend; otherwise, his friend’s presence would be too noticeable. The old scholar had appeared briefly in Fuyun Continent before quickly slipping away without a trace. 

Only the tall man remained. 

He said to Mi Yu, “You can call me Liu Sixteen. I’ve just returned to the vast world to pay my respects. If I can’t meet the master, I’ll at least see the portrait of the master. If I end up crying with a snotty face, just pretend you didn’t see.” 

Mi Yu was at a loss for words. 

Having stabilized his mind, Mi Yu said, “The key to the ancestral hall is with Nuan Shu.” 

The man nodded, “Then I’ll trouble the sword immortal to make a trip; I’ll wait here.” 

Wei Ban soon brought Nuan Shu and Little Mi Li to this place. 

The two little girls respectfully bowed to Wei Shan Jun, the so-called “mountain master senior brother.” 

Upon seeing the two girls, the man’s expression softened, realizing that his little junior brother wasn’t bad after all. 

After Chen Nuan Shu opened the door of the ancestral hall, the tall man stood outside, his expression solemn as he straightened his robe and then stepped over the threshold. 

Just as the sword-wielding scholar was about to cross continents. 

He encountered that sneaky old scholar. 

He asked, “Why didn’t you show up earlier?” 

The old scholar confidently replied, “I was waiting for that big dumb guy to finish crying.” 

The scholar glanced up at the sky. 

The old scholar asked, “Brother Bai, don’t miss this chance; why not just strike a few swords? What does it mean to be a sword immortal? Isn’t it about cutting down the serpentine spirits in the wind? Those ancient deities who visit without warning are no better than serpents; they should be struck first. Previously, when Xiao Qian drew her sword in Tongye Continent, it was such an astonishing sight. A mere girl has that sword intent, and you, Bai, stand at eight feet tall holding a celestial sword. How could you endure? Just let go! If you’re polite with me, I’ll get angry… To put it frankly, I’m good at cleaning up messes, but let’s agree first—three to five swords are enough; any more, and I can’t handle it. If you really feel unsatisfied, at most, seven or eight swords…” 

The scholar ignored the old scholar and vanished in a flash. 

The old scholar stomped his feet in frustration. 

He then looked towards Languishing Mountain. 

Recalling the past, Bai had once sent Liu Sixteen back to the mountains with the song of white clouds. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 832: Driving Away Dragons and Snakes, Not Mosquitoes

In the ancestral hall of Clear Sky Peak, Liu Sixteen quietly gazed up at the three portraits of the fallen heroes of Lopan Mountain, lost in thought.

Chen Nuanshu picked up a bamboo incense holder and raised it high, prompting Liu Sixteen to express his gratitude with a nod. He bent down to pluck three sticks of incense from the holder.

Zhou Mili told the burly man that she was feeling tired and would like to take a break, offering him her chair.

The little girl in black pointed to a chair that had a palm-sized note stuck on the back, which read “Right Guardian, Zhou Mili.”

Liu Sixteen nodded in understanding.

Chen Nuanshu tugged at Mili’s sleeve, and the two left the ancestral hall together, leaving Liu Sixteen alone.

As they exited the hall and walked past the outer door, they saw a poised swordsman in a simple blue gown, standing alongside Wei Shanjun, who was adorned in a flowing white robe with golden earrings. Together, they looked like a pair of exquisite orchids in a courtyard.

Mi Yu used his heart voice to inquire about Wei Bo, “How did you know the identity of that person? The Hidden Official never mentioned it.”

Wei Bo explained, “Earlier, when Mr. Bai approached the borders of North Yue, he introduced himself to the people of Piyun Mountain, saying, ‘Bai Ye is visiting Lopan Mountain with my friend Liu Sixteen.’ Liu Sixteen then claimed to be half a senior brother of Chen Ping’an and came here to pay respects to the portrait of his teacher.”

Mi Yu teased, “Speaking of Bai Ye, why is Wei Brother so excited?”

Wei Bo chuckled, “Who wouldn’t be fascinated by a sword immortal who isn’t a sword cultivator?”

There weren’t many people worthy of Wei Bo’s admiration—just Bai Ye, the inscription of A Liang on the Sword Qi Great Wall, and the great deity of Suishan in the Middle Lands.

Mi Yu shook his head. “In my hometown, people don’t speak much of him.”

It wasn’t that they thought the scholar’s reputation was undeserved, but rather that Bai Ye drew his sword so rarely that there wasn’t much to say. Excluding the year he cut through the Yellow River’s waterfall, he seemed to have no notable achievements in the long years that followed.

Until this time, when he appeared in the wild lands of Fuyou Prefecture, slaying a great demon with three strikes.

Actually, between his two sword strikes, the Fire Dragon Real Man visited a solitary island far from land, and later, Bai Ye quietly wielded his sword to slay a transcended great demon in the Middle Land’s Divine Continent.

Mi Yu glanced inside the door. The tall figure from afar lit three incense sticks but stood for a long time without placing them in the incense burner, likely muttering to himself.

Mi Yu couldn't help but feel envious of Liu Sixteen, who could burn incense and pay respects upon arriving at Lopan Mountain.

The sword immortal, known as Yu Mi, had been at Lopan Mountain for quite a while but had yet to pay his respects in the Clear Sky Peak’s ancestral hall. Yet, it wasn’t entirely his fault; he had said he would wait until the Hidden Official returned to his hometown, hoping to record “Mi Yu” in the ancestral hall’s genealogy when more people were present. As a result, he had postponed this for several years. Mi Yu was genuinely somewhat vexed, as there were many things happening at Lopan Mountain. Spending time with little Mili, eating melon seeds while watching the clouds drift by, or strolling along the white jade railing outside the Mountain God’s temple was simply too dull. He often found himself chatting with Liu Xianyang at the blacksmith shop by Longxu River, discussing the mysteries and knowledge of the celestial sect regarding the ephemeral nature of dreams, hoping to eventually invite Wei Shanjun, the guardian Zhou Fei, and that young man in white to seek fortune for Lopan Mountain and gather some spiritual energy.

However, while these activities were enjoyable and comforting, opportunities for serious matters were still far too few.

Mi Yu had a strong desire to meet the embroidered river goddess and find an opportunity to test her bravery with a sword strike.

In his hometown, opportunities to interact with gods of rivers and mountains were few and far between. He hadn’t expected that in this Baoping Continent, there would be shrines and deities everywhere.

He had long wanted to visit the fox nation in Clear Wind City. As for the city lord, Xu Hun, Mi Yu regarded him as a kindred spirit, seeing as Xu Hun was said to be a man who rolled in the world of cosmetics. Mi Yu was particularly eager to confirm whether, after all these years, the infamous “mole armor” that once belonged to Liu Xianyang’s family still fit him well.

As for the so-called “Ten Sword Immortals of the Ten Peaks” near Zhengyang Mountain, a recently emerged old ancestor sword immortal had just come out of seclusion. At that time, Mi Yu was dozing off at the riverside shop with Liu Xianyang when he heard Liu Xianyang mention the term “old sword immortal,” startling Mi Yu. He was weighing whether his jade purity realm in the Sword Qi Great Wall had a chance to exchange his life for that of the immortal realm in Baoping Continent when Liu Xianyang handed him a mountain water report, a special congratulatory letter from the mountain, with mud-gold characters on a blue background page.

Looking at the report filled with flattery, Mi Yu felt as if the old guy hadn’t merely entered the jade purity realm but had ascended to the transcendental realm. Mi Yu was baffled. Did he really need to remain in the jade purity realm for a hundred years? The reason he was honored as the “Embroidered Sword Immortal” in the Sword Qi Great Wall and gained the reputation of being among the “Top Ten in Jade Purity” was largely due to a six-month extended seclusion.

Mi Yu felt as though his beloved sword was rusting. If it weren’t for Bai Ye’s visit with Liu Sixteen, he might have almost forgotten that his life sword was named “Xia Mantian.”

Ordinary cultivators or mountain spirits, like the black snake from Qidun Mountain or the massive python in Huanghu Mountain, wouldn’t feel the passage of time too acutely. However, who was Mi Yu? He was someone who could doze off in the clouds of the Sword Qi Great Wall, unconcerned about sword refining. After arriving at Baoping Continent, especially after parting ways with Wei Jin at the Wind and Snow Temple, Mi Yu increasingly felt distanced from the Sword Qi Great Wall. He dared not even dream of becoming a great sword immortal, especially since he didn’t even know where the jade purity realm’s bottleneck lay.

In truth, according to Mi Yu’s own character, not knowing was fine; he didn’t care. Whether or not he became an immortal was left to fate; if heaven chose to give him a chance, he would accept it; if not, he wouldn’t seek it.

However, upon arriving at Lopan Mountain, without the Hidden Official at the mountain peak, the steward Zhu Lian also absent, and even Zheng Dafeng, who guarded the gate, far away, only Nuanshu and little Mili remained, along with a few children who had just begun practicing martial arts, or some spirits and ghosts that Mi Yu was not fond of dealing with. Thus, he inexplicably became the temporary backbone of Lopan Mountain, which felt rather strange.

After all, back in his hometown at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he was used to the presence of so many old and great sword immortals. Even if the sky were to fall, he wouldn’t fear it, especially since he had a brother, Mi Hu, who was a talented sword cultivator with the potential to rank among the top ten sword immortals in the Sword Qi Great Wall. Mi Yu was accustomed to being carefree and indifferent to everything, which made him nostalgic for the days at the Summer Resort and Spring Fan Studio, when the young Hidden Official would tell him what to do, and every time he did something, he would receive some form of reward afterward.

Suddenly, Mi Yu exclaimed, “If this continues, I’ll truly just be waiting to eat and die. Sunbathing and snacking on melon seeds is far too addictive.”

For some reason, on Lopan Mountain, perhaps it was too easy to adapt to this environment, Mi Yu felt he had fallen victim to a saying in a book: he was experiencing spring drowsiness.

Especially the daily routine of patrolling the mountain with Zhou Mili twice a day was the most enjoyable thing.

Wei Bo hesitated and asked, “Are you planning to visit Old Dragon City?”

Mi Yu glanced at the sky and shook his head. “I wanted to take a look before, but now I genuinely can’t leave Lopan Mountain unattended. It’s too close to Piyun Mountain and could easily attract those ancient remnants.”

Wei Bo nodded. “My North Yue is the only territory that hasn’t been invaded by ancient gods. We must be cautious.”

Inside the ancestral hall, after Liu Sixteen honored the incense, he closed his eyes and murmured once more.

Zhou Mili, with a golden shoulder pole and a green bamboo staff, said earnestly to Sister Nuanshu, “The mountain master’s half-brother is quite tall and seems very strong. And that’s only half! If he were a full brother, wouldn’t that be something?!”

Chen Nuanshu, with several keys hanging from her waist, sighed, “Half a brother doesn’t mean what you think it does.”

The little girl in black raised her eyebrows, clearly amused. “Sister Nuanshu, I was just joking. Didn’t you get that? It’s like I spoke for nothing.”

Chen Nuanshu smiled, narrowing her eyes, and patted the smaller Mili affectionately. “You’ve become a bit sharper today, Mili. Keep it up tomorrow.”

Zhou Mili nodded vigorously. “Yes, yes! Pei Qian always says that ambition isn’t bound by age, and cleverness isn’t measured by height.”

Liu Sixteen left the ancestral hall, crossed two thresholds, and smiled at Chen Nuanshu. “You can lock the door now.”

The girl in the pink skirt nodded and went to shut the inner door. After hesitating for a moment, Mili followed Sister Nuanshu to handle some tasks, pondering how to properly entertain their esteemed guest Liu Sixteen.

Liu Sixteen clasped his fist in gratitude towards Mi Yu and Wei Bo, saying, “Junior brother has been away from the mountain for many years, and I appreciate the care from you, Sword Immortal and Mountain Monarch.”

Mi Yu replied, “There’s no need for formalities, Mr. Liu. I am merely a worshipper of Lopan Mountain.”

Wei Bo added, “I owe my position as the Mountain Monarch of North Yue to A Liang and my friendship with Chen Ping’an. It’s only right to lend a hand in small matters.”

Liu Sixteen said, “No need to call me Mr. Liu; I don’t deserve it. Just call me Jun Qian. Although it’s also a pseudonym, I’ve always used this name publicly in the Haoran world.”

In the backyard of Yang’s pharmacy, smoke wafted around.

The old man Yang tucked his old smoking pipe into his belt and stood to greet them.

It was the old scholar and Bai Ye who had come together.

Previously, Bai Ye had already left the continent for the sea, but the persistent old scholar had stopped him, insisting they sit together for a while.

Bai Ye remembered the fate from the end of the Yuanbao years at the Spring Ming Gate in his homeland and accepted the old scholar’s invitation without refusal.

If Chen Chunan from South Posa Continent monopolized the term “refined scholar,” then Bai Ye singularly embodied the concept of “immortal.”

His swordsmanship was extraordinary, his talent in poetry unmatched, and although he had no rivals in verse, his lyrics and music circulated widely, leaving later generations astonished. They often suspected it was a false claim, but they dared not confirm it, resulting in many unsolved mysteries. In the end, there was only one explanation: as an immortal, what couldn’t he accomplish?

As the old scholar entered the courtyard, he immediately raised his fists high, shaking them vigorously, a radiant smile on his face. “Today, I finally have the honor to meet the Heavenly Lord Qing Tong. I’ve lived a full life, and it’s not been in vain!”

Old man Yang, rarely smiling, replied, “Mr. Wensheng, your demeanor is as impressive as ever.”

The union of a cultivator of the fourteenth realm with the Dao of Heaven and Earth was not trivial; it wasn’t merely about seeking greatness.

The former literary sage, who had once impressed old man Yang, now had his domain encompass South Posa Continent, Tongye Continent, and Fuyou Continent, rather than the more stable Middle Land Divine Continent, Aiai Continent, or Liuxia Continent.

Now that both continents had fallen, the old scholar was not in a relaxed position.

Bai Ye merely nodded in acknowledgment to old man Yang.

The old scholar, however, had no intention of letting Bai Ye off the hook. He pulled out a long-preserved document from his sleeve and handed it to old man Yang, cheerfully saying, “This is the ‘Yuanbao End Year’ piece, also known as the ‘Delightful Tablet,’ an authentic piece, absolutely genuine. It wouldn’t do to visit without a gift. The gift may not be light, but the sentiment is weightier.”

Old man Yang opened the document, revealing the piece from the end of the Yuanbao years, where Bai Ye, intoxicated by wine, had fallen asleep by the Spring Ming Gate, dreaming of riding on a raft with the Heavenly Lord Qing Tong across the starry river. Upon waking from his drunken dream, inspired, he composed the poem.

Old man Yang rolled up the document and tucked it into his sleeve.

This was originally a mutual understanding between Bai Ye and old man Yang, needing no words. However, the old scholar’s antics had robbed it of its lingering charm.

Unexpectedly, the old scholar boasted shamelessly, “Heavenly Lord Qing Tong, you might as well take a look. The beauty of this piece lies in the back. In addition to Cui Zhan’s embroidered tiger seal, there’s also Xiao Qi’s ‘Spring Breeze’ book seal, and the slightly incongruous characters ‘Jun Qian’ at the end, along with the seal that reads, ‘Look around; understanding is not far away.’”

Old man Yang did not take the document back out, understanding its significance.

Old man Yang remarked, “After the sage created characters, aside from the eight who contributed to the opening, there are no great masters in the world of calligraphy. They are the lowest of the low.”

It was evident that the old man did not recognize the calligrapher’s ability to rank among the top nine schools and even believed they lacked the qualifications to stand among the various scholars.

The old scholar was famously adept at keeping conversations going, eagerly nodding, “That’s not a pleasant thing to say, but it is a great truth. Cui Zhan expressed similar sentiments earlier, feeling that the so-called masters of calligraphy today are just scribblers. It’s like a snail shell trying to flip over the ocean; what else could it be but mischief?”

Bai Ye was well aware that the old scholar had good relations with several pioneering calligraphers. Cui Zhan’s worth a thousand pieces of gold didn’t come from thin air; it was the result of the old scholar traveling with him across the world, collecting autumn winds. Fine as any stone tablet or inscription might be, they still lacked the authentic spirit and intent. Yet, Cui Zhan had the opportunity to witness the original works of those calligraphy ancestors, thanks to the old scholar’s assistance.

“Brother, if you write a few more pieces, riding this wave of inspiration, just write whatever comes to mind. The more relatable the content, the more delightful it is. Whether you bought a few pounds of oranges or had a couple of meals today—whether it rained or shone, feel free to write about it. If all else fails, just say you met me today, an old friend with a kind heart, and sent you a basket of pears, causing you to shed tears…”

This must be treated as a family heirloom and treasured. “Brother, what kind of look is that? Am I the kind of person who sells out at the first opportunity? Do you think I have such friends?”

“I write; you write. We’re a perfect match. We just need a big vendor to help us publish the books, and then we’ll be unbeatable together.”

As for the so-called eight founders that the Heavenly Lord Qing Tong mentioned, Bai Ye had a rough idea: the Great Seal Taishi Zhou, the Small Seal Li Tonggu, the Clerical Script Yuan Cen, the Regular Script Shi Jiujiu, the Modern Cursive Zhang Chunhua, the Wild Cursive Zhang Huai, the Standard Regular Wang Zhong, and the Small Regular Script Zhong Yao. Only Cui Zhan was “not diligent,” just casually writing, but his cursive script was the most renowned. In reality, Cui Zhan’s small regular script was extremely exquisite, and the sutras he copied were treasures held by many great Buddhist temples in the Middle Lands.

The old scholar turned to sit on the long bench under the eaves, reaching out to pat it, “Sturdy.”

Old man Yang asked, “Mr. Wensheng, apart from having me send the calligraphy to Lopan Mountain and stamping more seals, what else do you need?”

The old scholar replied, “Nothing else, just a simple thank you to my predecessor.”

Old man Yang certainly didn’t believe that.

The old scholar wasn’t in a hurry to slap his own face; he looked left and right. 

Perhaps in the past, Xiao Qi and Xiao Ping An had both sat here. Without their teacher by his side, the student felt lonely and uneasy sitting alone, making it rather challenging.

The three of them almost simultaneously looked up.

In the sky of Baoping Continent, a massive hole appeared, with a golden-bodied spirit slowly peering out. Within thousands of miles of the sky, countless golden lightning bolts intertwined like a net, appearing to fall upon the North Yue’s Piyun Mountain.

The old scholar exclaimed, “Bai Brother, this is a provocation! Do you need me to shout ‘Bai Ye is here’ for you?”

Bai Ye’s expression remained calm. “With Liu Sixteen here, there’s no need.”

The old scholar stood up, rubbing his hands together. “That silly giant is always at a disadvantage in fights. He’s much worse than his junior brother. But that relentless momentum of his is still impressive.”

In the sky above Baoping Continent, the enormous remnant of the ancient divine being was merely brushed aside by what appeared to be a tiny figure. That minuscule person relentlessly struck at the towering spirit, creating an immense thunderclap. In the end, the uninvited guest, along with his hand, arm, and head, was shattered in an instant.

The high sky, spanning almost half a continent, rained down countless golden droplets. Before they could touch the earth, the majority of the golden fragments had already disappeared, melting into the heavens and earth. Guided by an unseen force, the remaining golden rain almost entirely fell within a thousand miles around Piyun Mountain. Just as they were about to land and merge into the mountain waters, a flash of golden light vanished, leaving many mountain spirits and celestial dwellings stunned. Had they been robbed by the Mountain Monarch Wei? Some enlightened beings immediately gazed upon the mountain range, only to find the spiritual energy of Piyun Mountain had not increased much—strange indeed.

On the steps of Qilong Alley, a smiling woman shook her sleeves, which sparkled with golden light, but the phenomenon quickly dissipated.

The old scholar remarked, “I’ll trouble the elder to lead the way.”

Old man Yang nodded.

Liu Sixteen felt a shift in his thoughts. In a sudden swoop, he descended towards the earth, abruptly shrinking the mountains and rivers by thousands of miles until he arrived in the backyard of the small town’s pharmacy.

Seeing the old scholar already standing on the bench, Liu Sixteen’s eyes turned red. Fortunately, he had already cried in the ancestral hall at Clear Sky Peak; otherwise, he would have been even more embarrassed.

The old scholar stood on the bench, stroking his beard with a smile.

Liu Sixteen quickly approached, his eyes brimming with tears, and bowed deeply, exclaiming, “Jun Qian pays respects to the teacher!”

Among his four former students, Cui Zhan was reserved, hiding his brilliance; Qi Jingchun learned the true teachings of the literary sage; Liu Sixteen was the most awkward yet also the most sincere.

The old scholar patted the sturdy man’s shoulder before jumping down from the bench. Then, stroking his beard, he laughed, “You truly are a good brother of Bai Ye, my excellent disciple. What a fine saying: ‘Driving away dragons and snakes, not mosquitoes!’”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 832: The Dragon and Snake Drive Away the Mosquitoes

Inside the Ancestral Hall of Jisi Peak, Liu Sixteen gazed silently at the three paintings that bore the incense offerings of the Lost Fortune Mountain, his head tilted back.

Chen Nuanshu walked over with a bamboo incense holder, raising it high with both hands. Liu Sixteen thanked her, bowing his head to pull out three incense sticks from the holder.

Zhou Milie told the burly man that she was tired and would rest, offering him her chair.

The little girl in black pointed to a chair, where a palm-sized note read, “Right Protector, Zhou Milie.”

Liu Sixteen nodded.

Chen Nuanshu tugged at Milie's sleeve, and together they left the Ancestral Hall, leaving Liu Sixteen alone.

As they stepped out of the shrine's main door and walked past the entrance to the Ancestral Hall, they saw Mi Jianxian, dressed in a simple green robe, and Wei Shanjun, draped in a snow-white gown with golden earrings, standing side by side at the entrance like fragrant orchids beside a jade tree.

Mi Yu sent a mental inquiry to Wei Ban: “How did you know the identity of the other person? The Hidden Official never mentioned it.”

Wei Ban explained that when Mr. Bai approached the borders of the North Mountain, he proactively introduced himself, saying, “Bai Ye visits Lost Fortune Mountain with my friend Liu Sixteen,” while Liu Sixteen claimed to be a half-brother of Chen Ping’an and came to pay his respects to the teacher's portrait.

Mi Yu teased, “Speaking of Bai Ye, are you that excited, Wei Brother?”

Wei Ban chuckled, “Who wouldn’t be in awe of a sword immortal who isn’t a sword cultivator?”

There were few people who could earn Wei Ban's admiration—Bai Ye, that calligrapher A Liang who carved inscriptions on the Sword Qi Great Wall, and the great deity of the Central Plains, Suishan.

Mi Yu shook his head. “In my hometown, there isn’t much talk about this person.”

It wasn’t that he thought the scholar’s fame was exaggerated, but Bai Ye had fought too few times to warrant much discussion. Aside from that one time he summoned the Yellow River's waterfall with a single sword strike, he seemed to have no accomplishments in the long years that followed.

Until this time, when he appeared on the rugged continent of Fuyouzhou, slashing down a major demon with three strikes.

In fact, between those two sword strikes, the Fire Dragon True Person visited a solitary island suspended over the sea, and after that, Bai Ye quietly set off on a distant journey, slaying a transcendent demon from the Central Plains with a single sword strike.

Mi Yu glanced back at the tall figure inside the hall. After lighting the three incense sticks, he towered over them, yet he hadn’t placed them in the incense burner for a long while, likely murmuring to himself.

Mi Yu envied Liu Sixteen, who could burn incense and pay respects as soon as he arrived at Lost Fortune Mountain.

Disguised as Yu Mi, the Jade Purity Realm Sword Immortal had been at Lost Fortune Mountain for quite some time but had never paid respects in this Ancestral Hall. It wasn’t anyone’s fault, as Mi Yu himself had said he would wait for the Hidden Official to return to his hometown and for more people to gather at Lost Fortune Mountain before registering “Mi Yu” in the ancestral records, which had dragged on for several years. Mi Yu was indeed getting a bit impatient, as there were many things to do on Lost Fortune Mountain. Spending time with Zhou Milie, eating sunflower seeds while watching the clouds drift, or strolling by the white jade railing outside the mountain god's temple was simply boring. So, he would go to the blacksmith shop by Longxu River to chat with Liu Xianyang, the equally lazy man, discussing the teachings and knowledge of the celestial sect regarding illusions, hoping to one day involve Wei Shanjun, the worshipful Zhou Fei, and that white-clad youth to seek a prosperous start, ultimately earning some divine money for Lost Fortune Mountain and enriching its spiritual energy.

However, while these activities were enjoyable and comforting, serious opportunities were too few.

Mi Yu was quite eager to meet the Embroidered River Water Deity, hoping to find a chance to sneak up and test her courage with a single sword strike.

In his hometown, Mi Yu had very few opportunities to interact with the gods of mountains and rivers. He never expected that in this Baoping Continent, shrines and deities were everywhere.

He had long wanted to visit the Fox Kingdom in Qingfeng City. As for the city lord, Xu Hun, Mi Yu regarded him as a kindred spirit since Xu Hun was rumored to be a man who rolled in makeup. Mi Yu wanted to confirm whether the city lord, who was contending with Huang He from Fenglei Garden for the title of “the first person under the realm of the five greats” in Baoping Continent, still fit into the inherited “mole armor” that belonged to Liu Xianyang’s family.

As for the so-called “Sword Paths Connecting to the Mountain Peaks, Ten Sword Immortals on Ten Peaks” of Zhengyang Mountain in Baoping Continent, there had just been a venerable sword immortal who emerged from seclusion. At that time, Mi Yu was dozing off with Liu Xianyang at the riverside shop, and when he heard Liu Xianyang mention “old sword immortal,” he was taken aback, contemplating whether his Jade Purity Realm from the Sword Qi Great Wall had a chance to exchange lives with the immortals of Baoping Continent. Liu Xianyang handed him a mountain and river bulletin—a congratulatory letter exclusive to the mountain, with mud-gold characters on a blue background.

Looking at that bulletin, Mi Yu noted that the flattering words made it seem like the old fellow had not just entered the Jade Purity Realm but had ascended to the Transcendent Realm. He wondered, how could someone merely at the Jade Purity Realm need to retreat for a hundred years? The reason why he was respected as the Embroidered Sword Immortal and earned the title of “First of the Jade Purity” was largely due to the fact that he had stayed in seclusion for half a year longer than expected.

Mi Yu felt that his treasured sword was about to rust. If it weren’t for this visit from Bai Ye and Liu Sixteen, he might have forgotten that his personal flying sword was called Xiamantian.

Ordinary cultivators or mountain spirits, like the black serpent from Chess Mountain or the great python in Huanghu Mountain, wouldn’t feel time passing too long. But who was Mi Yu? A person who could lounge in the clouds and mist in the Sword Qi Great Wall, relaxed and carefree, and upon arriving at Baoping Continent, especially after parting ways with Wei Jin at the Wind and Snow Temple, Mi Yu felt increasingly distant from the Sword Qi Great Wall, no longer dreaming of becoming a great sword immortal, as he didn’t even know where his Jade Purity Realm bottleneck lay.

In fact, according to Mi Yu’s nature, not knowing was just fine. Whether or not he became an immortal was left to fate; if Heaven chose to grant him that, he wouldn’t seek it, and if it was given, he would accept it.

However, upon arriving at Lost Fortune Mountain, with the Hidden Official not present at the mountain top, the chief steward Zhu Lian also absent, and even Zheng Dafeng, who watched the gate, having gone far away, it left only Nuanshu and Milie, along with some children who had only recently begun practicing their punches, or some spirits and demons Mi Yu was reluctant to interact with. Thus, Mi Yu inexplicably became the temporary backbone of Lost Fortune Mountain, which felt a bit strange.

After all, back in his hometown at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Mi Yu was already accustomed to the presence of many old sword immortals and great sword immortals. He wouldn’t fear even if the sky fell, especially since he had an elder brother, Mi Hu, a talented sword cultivator who originally had the chance to rank among the top ten sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall. Mi Yu had grown used to being carefree, accustomed to not caring about everything, so he missed those years at the Summer Resort Palace and Spring Banner Pavilion when the young Hidden Official would tell him what to do, and the key was that whatever he did would yield rewards afterwards.

Suddenly, Mi Yu sighed, “If things keep going like this, I’ll truly just be waiting to eat and die. Sunbathing and eating sunflower seeds are just too addictive.”

For some reason, at Lost Fortune Mountain, perhaps because he had adapted too well to this environment, Mi Yu felt that he had fallen victim to a certain saying in a book—spring drowsiness.

Especially the most interesting thing was the twice-daily mountain patrols with Zhou Milie.

Wei Ban hesitated a moment and asked, “Are you planning to check out Lao Long City?”

Mi Yu glanced at the sky and shook his head. “I wanted to see it before, but now I really can’t leave Lost Fortune Mountain. It's too close to Piyun Mountain; it’s easy to attract those remnants of ancient times.”

Wei Ban nodded. “My North Mountain is the only territory that hasn’t been invaded by ancient deities. We must be very careful.”

Inside the Ancestral Hall, after Liu Sixteen paid his respects, he closed his eyes once more, murmuring softly.

Zhou Milie, shouldering a golden shoulder pole and holding a green bamboo staff, turned seriously to Sister Nuanshu and said, “The half-brother of the Mountain Lord is really tall and looks strong. And that’s only half! If he were a whole one, what would happen?!”

Chen Nuanshu, who had several keys hanging from her waist, helplessly replied, “Half or whole, it doesn’t mean the same thing.”

The little girl in black raised her brows in delight. “Sister Nuanshu, I was just joking! Didn’t you get it? It’s like I said nothing at all.”

Chen Nuanshu smiled, her eyes narrowing, and patted the slightly shorter Zhou Milie, gently saying, “Milie, you’ve become a bit more clever today than yesterday. Keep it up tomorrow.”

Zhou Milie nodded vigorously. “Right, right! Pei Qian said before, ambition doesn’t depend on age, and cleverness doesn’t depend on height.”

Liu Sixteen left the Ancestral Hall, stepping over two thresholds, and smiled at Chen Nuanshu, saying, “We can lock the door now.”

The girl in a pink skirt nodded and went to close the inner door. Zhou Milie hesitated for a moment but decided to follow Sister Nuanshu to handle serious matters. As for how to properly entertain the esteemed guest Liu Sixteen, she would need to think it over carefully.

Liu Sixteen clasped his hands in salute to Mi Yu and Wei Ban, expressing his gratitude, “Junior Brother hasn’t been at the mountain for many years. Thank you, Sword Immortal and Mountain Lord, for your care.”

Mi Yu replied, “There’s no need for formalities, Mr. Liu. I am but a servant of Lost Fortune Mountain.”

Wei Ban added, “I owe my position as the Mountain Lord of the North to A Liang, and I am also a close friend of Chen Ping’an. We are closer than distant relatives; it’s only a small matter, it’s only right.”

Liu Sixteen said, “No need to call me Mr. Liu; I can’t bear it. Just call me Jun Qian. Though it’s also a pseudonym, I’ve always used this name in the Haoran world.”

In the backyard of Yang’s Medicine Shop, smoke curled in the air.

Old Yang tucked his old smoking pipe into his waist and stood up to greet them.

It was the old scholar who had come together with Bai Ye.

Earlier, Bai Ye had already left the continent and entered the sea, but he was stopped by the persistent old scholar, who insisted on coming here to sit for a while.

Bai Ye remembered the fateful encounter at Chunming Gate in his homeland at the end of the Yuanbao era and did not refuse the old scholar’s invitation.

If Chen Chunan from South Posa Continent monopolized the term “cultured gentleman,” then Bai Ye singularly monopolized the term “immortal.”

With unparalleled swordsmanship and dual mastery of poetry and prose, he was indeed unmatched in poetry. Yet, songs and melodies spread, leaving later generations astonished, feeling they were mere forgeries, but they couldn’t confirm it, resulting in numerous mysteries.

In the end, there was only one explanation—immortals can accomplish anything.

Upon entering the courtyard, the old scholar immediately raised his fists high and shook them vigorously with a radiant smile. “Today, I finally have the honor of meeting the Heavenly Lord Qing Tong! I thought I had lived a wasted life, but it seems I haven’t died in vain!”

Old Yang, rarely smiling, responded, “Mr. Wen Sheng, your demeanor remains as magnificent as it was back in the day.”

The union of the Fourteenth Realm cultivators with heaven and earth is not simple; it’s not merely about seeking greatness.

What truly made Old Yang regard this former Wen Sheng with esteem was that the place of his union was in South Posa Continent, Tongye Continent, and Fuyou Continent, rather than the stable territories of Central Plains, Aiai Continent, and Liuxia Continent.

Now that the two continents had fallen, this old scholar was undoubtedly not at ease.

Bai Ye merely nodded in greeting to Old Yang.

Old Yang didn’t exchange pleasantries with Bai Ye either.

However, the old scholar had no intention of letting Bai Ye off easily. He fished out a long-preserved letter from his sleeve and handed it to Old Yang with a grin. “This is the ‘Yuanbao End of Year’ letter, also known as the ‘De Yi Letter,’ an authentic piece of writing. It wouldn’t be right to visit without bringing a gift. The gift may not be light, but the sentiment is heavier.”

Old Yang unfolded it, revealing a letter from the end of the Yuanbao era, where Bai Ye drunkenly slept under Chunming Gate, dreaming of traveling the stars with Heavenly Lord Qing Tong. Upon waking from his dream, inspired, he composed this poem.

He rolled up the letter and tucked it into his sleeve.

Originally, it was an understanding between Bai Ye and Old Yang that required no words.

But with the old scholar stirring it up like this, the moment was devoid of lingering charm.

Unexpectedly, the old scholar boasted shamelessly, “Heavenly Lord Qing Tong, feel free to open it and take a look. The beauty lies in the back. Apart from Cui Zhan’s embroidered tiger seal, there’s Little Qi’s ‘Spring Breeze’藏书印, and the somewhat abrupt ‘Jun Qian’ at the end, finished with the seal ‘Look to the left and right, and the heart shall not be far.’”

Old Yang, however, did not take out the letter again, merely acknowledging it with a nod.

Old Yang remarked, “After the sage created characters, apart from the eight who also made significant contributions, there hasn’t been a single master in the world of calligraphy who hasn’t attained the Dao. The lowest of the lowest.”

It was evident that the old man did not recognize the calligrapher’s ability to rank among the top nine schools, even feeling that calligraphers didn’t deserve a place among the hundred schools of thought.

The old scholar was known for being able to follow up on anything said, always able to smooth things over, nodding vigorously, “That may not sound pleasant, but it’s the truth. Cui Zhan once had this sentiment early on, feeling that the so-called masters of calligraphy in the current age are merely scribblers. They’re all just empty shells that want to turn the tide—what else could it be but mischief?”

Bai Ye was well aware that several pioneering ancestors of the calligraphy school had good relations with the old scholar. Cui Zhan’s reputation for writing gold was not earned from thin air; it was due to the old scholar traveling the world with him during his early years, gathering autumn wind. No matter how good the stele and letters in the world were, they ultimately were separated from the true essence of authentic writing by a layer of paper. Cui Zhan, however, was able to see the original works of those calligraphy ancestors with the old scholar’s assistance.

“Old brother, you should write a few more letters, taking advantage of this inspiration from wine. Write down whatever comes to mind. The more down-to-earth the content, the more likable it will be. How many oranges did you buy? What meals did you eat today? Did the wind blow or rain? Did you enjoy yourself on the balcony? Did the bamboo shoots turn out a bit bitter today? Just write freely. If that doesn’t work, say you met me today, and your old friend was so generous, he sent you a basket of pears, making you cry uncontrollably…”

It would need to be treated as a family heirloom. “Old brother, what kind of expression is that? Am I the kind of person who sells things the moment I step out? You think I’d have friends like that?”

“I write, you write. We're a perfect match. We just need a big business tycoon to help with the printing and selling of books. Otherwise, the three of us together would be unbeatable in the world.”

As for the so-called eight founding figures of the Heavenly Lord Qing Tong, Bai Ye had a rough idea: Da Zhuang Taishi, Li Tonggu of the small seal script, Yuan Cen of the clerical script, Shi Jiujiu of the regular script, Zhang Chunhua of the running script, Zhang Huai of the wild cursive script, Wang Zhong of the standard script, and Zhong Yao of the small regular script. Only Cui Zhan was “not diligent in his craft,” just casual about it. In fact, Cui Zhan’s small regular script was exceptionally exquisite; the sutras he copied were treasures in many major Buddhist temples in Central Plains.

The old scholar turned and sat on the long bench beneath the eaves, patting the bench with his hand. “Sturdy.”

Old Yang asked, “Mr. Wen Sheng, aside from having me pass on the letter to Lost Fortune Mountain and seal it with more stamps, what else do you wish for?”

The old scholar replied, “Nothing else. Just to thank the senior.”

Old Yang certainly didn’t believe it.

The old scholar wasn’t in a hurry to slap his own face, glancing left and right.

Perhaps in the past, Little Qi and Little Ping’an had also sat here. Without the teacher nearby, the student felt lonely sitting there, unable to rest comfortably, which was somewhat exhausting.

The three of them almost simultaneously looked up.

In the sky of Baoping Continent, a massive hole appeared, with a golden-skinned deity slowly poking its head out. Countless golden lightning bolts intertwined like a web across thousands of miles around the vicinity, and its gaze seemed to have landed on the area around North Mountain and Piyun Mountain.

The old scholar stomped his foot. “Bai Brother! This guy is definitely provoking you! Do you need me to shout ‘Bai Ye is here’ for you?”

Bai Ye’s expression remained calm. “With Liu Sixteen here.”

The old scholar stood up, rubbing his hands. “That big guy, fighting bare-handed, would suffer losses. It’s better that Bai Brother has a celestial sword…”

Yet, in the middle of the old scholar’s words.

A robust figure, originally at Jisi Peak of Lost Fortune Mountain, was first sent by Mountain Lord Wei Ban to a secluded edge of North Mountain territory. Then, within a radius of a hundred miles, there was the sound of the earth rumbling, and the figure shot straight up into the sky.

Wei Ban wiped the sweat from his forehead. Sending this person who called himself “Jun Qian” to the boundary of his jurisdiction was such a laborious task. He was no longer the land deity of Chess Mountain, but the Mountain Lord of the North. If it was this difficult, was Liu Sixteen’s “way” too exaggerated?

That figure transformed into a rainbow of light, soaring into the highest point of the sky.

Since that ancient deity was still far from the ground while in the sky, it had not yet been suppressed too much by the Great Dao. It was an undeniable colossal being, like a great mountain suspended in the air.

The old scholar laughed and scolded, “That foolish giant always suffers in fights. He’s far behind his junior disciple. But his unwavering momentum is still quite impressive.”

At that moment in the sky of Baoping Continent, the deity, as large as a mountain, was abruptly struck aside by a figure as small as a mustard seed. This infinitesimal being continuously punched at the towering deity, and in an instant, the sky reverberated with thunder. Eventually, the unexpected guest's hand, arm, and head shattered instantly.

In the high sky spanning nearly half a continent, countless golden droplets fell. Before they could land, the vast majority of the golden fragments had already vanished, dissolving into the world. It was as if they were drawn by the mysterious Great Dao, with the remaining golden rain almost entirely falling within a thousand miles around Piyun Mountain. Just as they were about to merge with the mountains and waters, the golden light flickered and vanished, leaving many mountain spirits and celestial dwellings stunned. Could it be that Mountain Lord Wei intercepted them? Several enlightened beings immediately observed the mountains and rivers, looking at Piyun Mountain, but it seemed that the spiritual energy in the mountains and waters had not increased too much—what a strange occurrence.

On the steps of Qilong Alley, a smiling woman shook the golden light flowing from her sleeves, but the anomaly disappeared in an instant.

The old scholar said, “I’ll trouble the senior to lead the way.”

Old Yang nodded.

Liu Sixteen felt a shift in his thoughts and swiftly descended. Approaching the earthly ground, he suddenly shrank the mountains and rivers by thousands of miles, arriving at the backyard of a small town’s medicine shop.

Seeing the old scholar already standing on the long bench, Liu Sixteen’s eyes turned red. Thankfully, he had already cried in the Ancestral Hall; otherwise, it would be even more embarrassing now.

The old scholar stood on the bench, stroking his beard and smiling.

Liu Sixteen walked over quickly, tears brimming in his eyes, and bowed deeply, calling out, “Jun Qian pays respects to the teacher!”

Among the four students of the past, Cui Zhan was reserved, with a sharp edge; Qi Jingchun received the true teachings of the Wen Sheng, while Liu Sixteen was the most awkward but also the most sincere.

The old scholar patted the broad-shouldered man’s shoulder, jumped down from the long bench, and nodded with a smile, “As expected, you’re a good brother of Bai Ye; my good disciple, what a great ‘only drives away dragons and snakes, not mosquitoes!’”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 833: Riddles

The old scholar took Liu Sixteen to explore the town of Huaihuang County together. Liu Sixteen had never traveled to Lihuzhou Cave, so he couldn't feel any sense of nostalgia or change. 

The tall man only felt sentimental. This was the place where Xiao Qi, although far from home, found peace in his heart. For true scholars, it's easy to feel lost when gazing into the distance; the hardest part is finding a sense of belonging, a "hometown" where they can truly relax along the endless path of learning.

Liu Sixteen regretted his "return to the mountains" journey, thinking he should have waited a bit longer. Even if he couldn't change the outcome of Lihuzhou Cave, it would have let Xiao Qi know that during his solitary journey, he had a fellow disciple watching him from behind. That way, he wouldn’t feel so isolated, as if he were at odds with the whole world, which could seem pitiful, laughable, and incomprehensible to others.

The old scholar said softly, "Silly tall one, there's no need to be too sad. We scholars, when we read and seek knowledge, are in tune with the sages of the past, becoming their neighbors and friends. Once we put aside the texts of the sages, we should take the initiative, claiming, 'Who else but me?'"

The old scholar murmured the phrase "Who else but me?" again.

Liu Sixteen nodded but still felt somewhat downcast. Restraining his nature and true self was indeed something he excelled at.

Time passed slowly, and as the years rolled on, if considered by actual age, not to mention a few senior brothers, even the teacher and close friend Bai Ye could be said to be "younger" than him—far from it. 

But wisdom comes with experience. 

Thus, the old scholar, who was not tall and had a thin frame, was referred to as "old" scholar.

Huaihuang County was now a top-tier county in the Great Li Dynasty.

The townsfolk, who once made their living by firing ceramics, relying on mountains and rivers, had almost all left the town and the dragon kiln. They sold their ancestral homes and moved to the state capital to enjoy a better life. The biggest and only official in the town back then was the supervising official, but now officials of all ranks could be seen everywhere. Each year, the peach blossoms bloomed on time, and though the old porcelain mountain and the immortal's tomb were gone, the incense at the civil and military temples flourished. At the peaks of the mountains and the banks of the rivers, there were now numerous temples that attracted throngs of worshippers.

In the past, the town lacked a county government but had an old locust tree that provided shade for the fields. Under that tree, every dusk, old men would gather to share tales of the past, while children, tired of listening to stories, would play among themselves. During the summer heat, when the children were worn out, they would run to the Iron Chain Well, eagerly awaiting their elders to pull up the basket and slice the melons and fruits chilled by natural ice. Despite the heat of the day, the water, the melons, and even the knife felt cool, as if their eyes were cooled too.

The old scholar arrived at the site of the Iron Chain Well, where the well still stood even without the iron chains, but its mysteries had vanished. Today, the county's officials had lifted the restrictions, but the number of people coming to draw water had greatly decreased. This small county town was filled with all kinds of people, many of whom were cultivators seeking the dragon's energy, spiritual energy, and the energy of immortals. As a result, the market atmosphere in the town was not as lively as that in the northern state capital, where the smoke from cooking fires and the sounds of roosters and dogs filled the air.

The old scholar suddenly smiled and said, "Your little junior brother was once an apprentice kiln worker and was very skilled. However, he traveled far as a youth, believing he hadn’t truly graduated, so he never easily put his skills to use. If you see your junior brother in the future, you can ask him to help you burn some scholar’s supplies, like the Four Treasures of the Study, or some small items. Just tell him directly; there’s no need to be too formal. Your junior brother is never stingy."

Liu Sixteen responded with an "mm." 

This time, reuniting with the teacher after a long time, the teacher had mentioned his junior brother in every sentence. Liu Sixteen listened and remembered every word without feeling the slightest jealousy; he was only happy because the teacher's mindset had seemed so relaxed for a long time.

The old scholar certainly meant something by his words, but after waiting for a long time without any realization from the silly tall one, he kicked Liu Sixteen lightly on the calf.

The teacher felt guilty towards his little disciple and couldn’t bear to ask for items himself. Did the other students not know to ease the teacher’s burden a little? The silly tall one was clearly not as clever as his junior brother.

Liu Sixteen immediately understood and said, "Student will also ask for a few items for the teacher."

The old scholar pretended to be troubled, rubbing his hands. "What kind of propriety is that, what kind of propriety?"

Liu Sixteen replied, "The teacher hasn’t said anything. Your junior brother is so clever; he will naturally understand."

The old scholar immediately changed his expression, stroking his beard with a laugh, "Of course, your junior brother is the best at drawing connections, especially between the characters 'ten thousand' and 'one.' The teacher hasn’t taught him much, yet he has learned extremely well on his own. Now, everyone says my ability to take disciples is unparalleled; in fact, it’s quite embarrassing for me."

In reality, the matter of taking Chen Ping’an as a closed-door disciple had never been mentioned by the great deity Suishan, and neither had Chen Chun’an, Bai Ze, or later Bai Ye ever agreed with a word.

So who exactly the "everyone" the old scholar referred to was, who knows?

Liu Sixteen nodded. "I only heard some rumors from Bai Ye and the teacher, which confirmed that your junior brother is indeed very clever."

The old scholar chuckled heartily. 

It had been a long time since he felt so refreshed.

The silly tall one praised his teacher, recognizing his foresight and the cleverness of his junior brother, which made the elder brother confident and pleased. 

Good, good, very kind, very kind.

In terms of worldly knowledge, among the four direct disciples, Cui Zhan was undoubtedly the best. In fact, the silly tall one could rank second, but he just didn't like to talk and often kept to himself. When he did speak, it was often in a straightforward manner, like when he once chased after A Liang to play a game.

Among the four brothers, there was no distinction between closeness or distance. While Xiao Qi and his peer sometimes had conflicts, their relationship was actually closer. Cui Zhan and Liu Sixteen had a decent relationship; one thought too much, while the other spoke too little, so they got along well.

As Liu Sixteen walked through the town, besides strolling with the teacher, he paid attention to many details—the presence or absence of the door gods at each household, the size of the incense offerings at the civil and military temples, and whether the aura of the mountains and rivers in the county flowed steadily and harmoniously... All these were part of his senior brother Cui Zhan's increasingly refined achievements, revealing an invisible manifestation of the "Great Way" in the Great Li Dynasty.

One must understand that "the human heart is indeed precarious, and the way of the Dao is subtle," which is precisely the first eight characters of the Confucian "heart transmission."

In Liu Sixteen’s eyes, Cui Zhan's meticulous cultivation over the past century or so in both the Great Li and Baoping Continent was indeed a remarkable feat, balancing the heavy and the light with ease.

In his early years, Cui Zhan was not a grand master of the Great Li; he was merely an heir of the Literary Sage. He had so much to say about the state of the world, but as his knowledge grew, his naturally proud temperament meant that in his life, there seemed to be only one person willing to listen: Liu Sixteen, this silent and reticent junior brother, whom Cui Zhan deemed worthy to speak to.

Liu Sixteen said, "Earlier, when the ancient remnant's golden body shattered, my intention was to gift it to the North岳 region, as a token of gratitude to Lord Wei of Piyun Mountain. I didn’t expect there to be a strange presence in Qilong Lane that could actually cast a spell and gather all the body fragments. It seems Lord Wei wasn’t surprised at all; he looked entirely unbothered."

The old scholar nodded. "That long-lived friend in Qilong Lane has an impressive background; she is the incarnation of the ancient gold essence copper coin. She currently serves as a temporary unmarked worshipper of the Fallen Mountain. When she comes to gather the golden body fragments, the Great Way aligns perfectly, so it’s a matter of course. Besides Lord Wei, the cultivators in the North岳 region would only be left in the dark. Lord Wei is used to taking the blame for Fallen Mountain, as debts do not weigh one down. So, when you meet Lord Wei in the future, be extra courteous and observe how magnanimous he is; he has hosted numerous night feasts without batting an eye."

Liu Sixteen replied, "Then I will seek out Brother Zuo later and break a few remnants of those golden bodies that covet the North岳 mountains and rivers. I’ll also remind the long-lived friend to ensure she gives five shares to Piyun Mountain."

The old scholar nodded in satisfaction, saying, "Helping others is helping oneself; it is indeed a good habit."

For now, the silly tall one wouldn’t have major issues. 

Even if some accidents occurred, as the teacher, he wouldn’t simply be idle.

Moreover, Liu Sixteen’s words were equally ineffective with Brother Zuo. 

Brother Zuo had always liked to put on airs as an elder brother. Back in the tavern at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he was a bit shy and didn’t act right.

In the past, whenever the old scholar wanted to drink more or host a small banquet for the Five Zang Temple, he would urge the silly tall one to manage the funds with Brother Zuo, suggesting they spend what they had today and borrow if they lacked money tomorrow. Yet, not once did it ever work out. Xiao Qi was much more considerate, knowing to take the opportunity to set up stalls and help write letters and Spring Festival couplets. Each time he earned some pocket money, he never let Brother Zuo handle it, and then the teacher and a few students would secretly leave Brother Zuo behind, first finishing their drinks and burping in the yard before entering the house, leaving Brother Zuo out of the loop.

Liu Sixteen asked, "On the way here, Bai Ye mentioned to me that the previous Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Xiao Zhen, should have integrated with the barbaric world."

The old scholar replied, "Xiao Zhen is a sword cultivator and has indeed integrated with the world, so he shouldn’t be underestimated. However, if Brother Zuo is pushed too hard, he doesn’t necessarily need to integrate with the world to reach the Fourteenth Stage..."

At this point, the old scholar looked worried and shook his head. "It’s best if he doesn’t; which Fourteenth Stage cultivator can be considered free? Moreover, your Brother Zuo is the most taboo sword cultivator. It’s a tremendous trouble; you know that well enough. When Brother Zuo is stubborn, even if it’s just you few junior brothers, it’s not easy for me as the teacher to influence him. I was never willing for Brother Zuo to learn swordsmanship."

Liu Sixteen remarked, "Brother Zuo started practicing swordsmanship quite late, yet he can make the 'Sword Immortal embryo' a topic of discussion on the mountain. Even Bai Ye believes Brother Zuo’s path is substantial, and his swordsmanship will be high."

The old scholar sighed, "The path of gains and losses cannot be overlooked."

As they strolled, many passersby in the streets noticed the tall Liu Sixteen, but it was fortunate that Longzhou had grown accustomed to the presence of mountain deities, so they didn’t find the tall man frightening.

Because of the relationship between the closed-door disciple Chen Ping’an and the child-like Guige, the Great Li Dynasty, in return, left behind only a "falsehood" of the ancient well that resembled a small cave heaven, while the "truth" was moved behind the bamboo houses of the Fallen Mountain to the pond’s edge, where there was another hidden world. Though the Song family of the Great Li recognized the value of the well and its many secrets, they remained unable to fully develop the small cave heaven on their own. There were simply too few sword immortals in Baoping Continent; otherwise, the small cave heaven in the well, albeit small, was a remarkable cultivation site, particularly suitable for those associated with dragons and water spirits. It was also possible that Cui Dongshan deliberately kept it hidden, having long considered the well to be his own property.

The old scholar sat for a while by the well, contemplating how to connect the lotus root blessed land with the small cave heaven. After thinking it over, he considered seeking help, which was manageable since he had built some connections in the Haoran world. Sadly, money was hard to come by, so he could only sigh, "A penny can defeat a hero, and a poor scholar dies of worry," to which Liu Sixteen offered to borrow money from Bai Ye. However, the old scholar shook his head, saying it wasn't good to borrow money from friends, as it would damage their relationship. Then the old man looked up at the silly tall one, and after thinking for a moment, Liu Sixteen said it wouldn’t count as borrowing money from Bai Ye.

It is said that the first time Bai Ye sent Jun Qian back to the mountains, he drunkenly wrote the word "magnificent," and deliberately wrote the "magnificent" character a bit bigger.

It implied that his friend Jun Qian's grand demeanor was not limited to just a bit, viewing the rivers and mountains of the world over countless years.

Recalling the past, that person who was hailed as the most accomplished scholar in the world, could write such a work and have such aspirations, indeed had no regrets.

After sending his friend back to the mountains, Bai Ye descended the mountain alone, wielding his sword among mortals. With a single strike, he split the Yellow River's cave heaven, allowing the scholar to resist the heavenly will with his own strength, ensuring that the central land would never again worry about drought.

This single act significantly boosted the water transport of the Haoran world by a tenth.

What a spirited display!

Thus, Wei Ban, who hailed from the ancient Divine Water Kingdom, naturally held Bai Ye in high esteem.

As for those who could be so unrestrained and casual with Bai Ye, there was probably only this "Jun Qian brother," who had once accompanied Bai Ye to visit the immortals.

At this moment, the old scholar smiled broadly, standing up and heavily patting the silly tall one's arm, praising, "Sixteen, you’ve made progress."

In this world, how could there be a senior brother who doesn’t look after his junior brother? In the lineage of the Wensheng, there certainly wasn’t.

The old scholar wasn’t without the means to acquire some money himself. In the vast Haoran world, even the most deeply hidden heavenly materials and earthly treasures couldn’t escape his discerning eye. However, it was a matter of knowing what to do and what not to do; he felt it was crucial to talk about the rules of earning money, especially since the Great Way had its own order. Earning something unjustly today would inevitably lead to loss tomorrow; it wasn’t worth it. As a teacher, he wouldn’t want to complicate matters for the youngest and most promising disciple.

Bringing Liu Sixteen to the place popularly known as the Crab Workshop, the old scholar stopped and said, "This is where the Ascension Platform is guarded by the Qingtong Tianjun; it has ended up looking like this."

With one hand behind him and the other pointing to the sky, he continued, "Once, a heavenly general was responsible for guiding earth immortals to ascend. At that time, the so-called earth immortals were known for their 'truth,' which was comparatively valuable compared to 'heavenly immortals,' who lived long and roamed the land, referred to as terrestrial immortals. As for the current Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators, being called earth immortals, they are simply incomparable. The 'seeking truth' of immortals is mainly about understanding the heavenly way, achieving liberation, and ultimately ascending. During that tumultuous and grand battle, this heavenly general, adorned in 'Great Frost' armor, was the only one to choose to fight to the death, and he was pinned to the door by a certain elder... no, it was by a not-so-elderly predecessor with a single sword."

The last true dragon in the world, after enduring countless hardships, had to escape here for a reason. As long as the Qingtong Tianjun was willing to reopen the Ascension Platform, there would be a glimmer of hope. Though the heavens had perished, there was still no talk of ascension. However, escaping to a secret realm of shattered mountains and rivers wouldn’t be difficult. At that point, it would be a true case of being far and wide.

However, as one of the greatest criminals in heaven and earth, Qingtong Tianjun's situation was precarious, akin to a mud bodhisattva crossing a river; self-preservation wasn’t hard, but she seemed to need to hold incense high over her head every day to prevent the incense from ceasing, naturally reluctant to ruin the rules set by the three individuals at the Fifteenth Stage for the sake of a little true dragon.

The Lihuzhou Cave was a series of interconnected truths set up by Yang Laotou, obscuring the shallow illusions visible to the world, in fact, to hide the greatest truth, which was the true illusion.

The old scholar lingered at the archway for a long time, gazing up at one of the tablets.

Liu Sixteen asked, "That fellow who entered the Haoran world from the barbaric world, using the name Zhou Mi, has many tricks. Do you know what his background is, teacher?"

Due to his status, Liu Sixteen had never been very interested in worldly affairs.

The old scholar's expression grew serious as he slowly replied, "His surname is Jia; I won't say his full name to avoid attracting his scrutiny. He was once a genuine student of our Confucian school, so we can call him Jia Sheng."

Liu Sixteen immediately understood, “So it’s him.”

Upon reflection, he felt it was unexpected yet within reason.

Historically, many scholars after Jia Sheng's death had defended him and cried injustice, with some even stating, "In one generation, the great Confucian is none other than Jia Sheng." Those who said this were not ordinary people.

The so-called great Confucian praised Jia Sheng for his talent, charisma, and literary prowess. It was evident that within the Confucian lineage, there was no disagreement regarding the current rules. In the Western Buddhist nations, and even in the Qīng Míng world, there was no such thing as a hundred schools contending.

Liu Sixteen asked, "What do you think of Jia Sheng’s Twelve Policies for Peace?"

"A powerful remedy, one that can indeed bring peace." 

The old scholar smiled, "But there is a problem with it: Jia Sheng is solely focused on treatment. Even if he saves someone, the power of the medicine is too strong. For example, in this market below the mountains surrounding us, no matter how good the medicine is, after several years or ten years, most people would just become a medicine jar. How can one not worry about that? 

These are just superficial issues; there is a deeper root cause: the knowledge of Jia Sheng diverges fundamentally from the Confucian teachings."

Liu Sixteen softly asked, "So, is that why you resolutely denied the achievements of the eldest senior brother back then?"

The old scholar hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "His achievements are somewhat better than Jia Sheng’s because it isn’t about starting from scratch, rebuilding a house and nailing shut the windows, leaving only one door. Your senior brother’s achievements are far from being as extreme as Jia Sheng’s."

The old scholar pointed to the now faded tablets and asked, "Why are the tablets hung high while the couplets are often posted wide?"

Liu Sixteen followed the teacher's finger and answered, "Only by walking on a wide path can one steadily ascend to greater heights."

The old scholar nodded in approval and then led Liu Sixteen around the archway, sharing some insights in a whisper.

The four tablets read: "Taking the Initiative," "Seek Nature," "Do Not Seek Outside," and "Energy Shocking the Bull."

After circling around, they returned to the tablet that read "Taking the Initiative."

The old scholar emphasized the Daoist aspect.

The Daoist tablet’s "Seek Nature" praises the individual who is the first disciple of the Dao ancestor, Bai Yujing. He ultimately transformed into the Three Pure Ones. On the street of blessings in Lihuzhou Cave, the scholar Li Xisheng, who was stuck in the peach and plum blossoms, belonged to the Confucian lineage, while the one in the Daoist sect was enveloped in the Dao. There was still another, even the old scholar himself didn’t know for the time being, but it was presumed to be a disciple of the Buddhist sect.

The struggle among the three teachings resides within me.

I discuss the Dao with myself, living in the world while being at odds with it, as if a ghost ship brushes against the vessel; even if there are those with malicious hearts, they remain calm.

This is the true greatness of the Dao ancestor’s method.

Compared to the mixed praises and criticisms of Bai Yujing's other two headmasters, this Dao ancestor's first disciple has an excellent reputation outside the Qīng Míng world in several realms.

Moreover, both Dao's second and Lu Chen were his disciples, but only the Dao ancestor's closed-door disciple was replaced with Lu Chen as his apprentice.

Liu Sixteen furrowed his brow slightly.

The old scholar patted his arm, "No need to think too much. Although in the Lihuzhou Cave, Li Xisheng, one of the three, is a latecomer, in the Haoran world, Xiao Qi is the one who arrived last. Moreover, the Dao ancestor himself has no intention of targeting Xiao Qi; it’s more about the methods of the other two lineages from Bai Yujing. Li Xisheng has always been somewhat out of control. If it weren’t for Lu Chen’s plotting, the kind of grand competition between Xiao Qi and Li Xisheng would have been as fierce as the waves clashing, creating towering waves with a magnificent spirit. Regardless of victory or defeat, it would never have been a matter of lowly actions. Perhaps..."

Even as the old scholar spoke to his disciple in a whisper, he still didn’t express his feelings.

Originally, the old scholar wanted to say, "As fellow practitioners, we should establish our teachings and recognize our ancestors. One is a primary disciple while the other is a secondary disciple, and the Great Way benefits each other."

Whether it was Li Xisheng, the Dao ancestor, or Xiao Qi, once both sides truly began to debate the Dao, they would surely have this broad-mindedness.

But they had not been able to reach that point.

Now that things had reached this stage, the situation was already set; it was pointless to say more.

However, the old scholar’s reluctance to speak excessively on this matter did not mean he was indifferent.

The old scholar never endorsed the unprincipled notion of repaying kindness with vengeance; that was not a broad-minded attitude but rather ignorance.

Liu Sixteen turned his head, having to lower it to see the teacher's profile.

The teacher was gazing up at the four characters with a hint of sadness.

It was just that the teacher felt too lonely. There were very few who could share a drink with him and allow him to speak his mind freely.

The plaque read: "Taking the Initiative."

The old scholar had not withdrawn his gaze for a long time.

"Who else but me?"

In the Confucian lineage, there was Qi Jingchun of the Lihuzhou Cave, Cui Zhan of the Baoping Continent, and Brother Zuo of the Tongye Continent, as well as Chen Ping’an of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Now, there was also Liu Sixteen, who had returned to the Haoran world.

A gentle breeze brushed his face; the old scholar looked around and smiled, raising his hand to scratch his head, murmuring, "The spring breeze knows my intentions, sending dreams back to past years. There are many in the world who are improper; many injustices exist, but they cannot extinguish the beauty in my heart."

Liu Sixteen echoed softly.

The past is gone, and the future has yet to come. Time is forever the past, and every moment has a future. The past once was the future, and the future will become the past.

In the end, he was kicked by the teacher, who jokingly scolded him to stop it. The Confucian lineage was fortunate to have his little junior brother, or else they would be laughed at for being a group of hermits.

Liu Sixteen grinned, mimicking the teacher's head-scratching gesture, glad he still had plenty of hair. 

But when he looked at the teacher’s thin figure, he couldn't help but feel sad and nearly shed tears.

When Liu Sixteen raised his head, he wondered why no one was coming yet. Why was there no movement in the sky? Feeling discontent, he prepared to throw a punch to vent his frustrations.

The old scholar chuckled, "Silly tall one, look forward to something good. Fighting and killing is too un-scholarly."

After that, the old scholar took Liu Sixteen to the old academy. Though it had fallen into disrepair, there was no sign of decay; everywhere was clean and organized.

It was said that a young girl named Warm Tree would come down regularly to clean the academy and the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Lane.

They then visited the new academy established by the Chen family at Longwei Creek, where the sound of reading echoed.

The old scholar particularly enjoyed watching the little children shake their heads as they learned; some recited fluently while others stumbled over their words, but all were quite good.

While visiting the academy, the old scholar also observed the teaching methods of the instructors, their demeanor, and their tones.

In truth, true Buddhas merely speak ordinary words.

In official circles, using bureaucratic language is unavoidable, yet one must not speak only in officialese; remember, all official language derives from human language.

Even as a deity on the mountain, one cannot only possess the aura of immortals with sleeves full of clouds and wind; there must also be some human warmth.

Having read too many texts from the sages, people differ, and their reasoning varies. Ultimately, one must hope for improvements in the world; otherwise, constantly lamenting and speaking strange words while dragging others into disappointment and despair is not virtuous.

After leaving the academy, as they walked through the Apricot Blossom Lane, the old scholar casually said to Liu Sixteen, "Back then, Xiao Qi accompanied Brother Zuo on a journey through the mountains and rivers, while you visited Baidi City with Cui Zhan."

Liu Sixteen nodded. "After Cui Shixiong finished the Cloud Color Chess game with the lord of Baidi City, he wrote a cursive couplet for Zheng's family: 'No ancients before, no successors after; standing right in the middle.'"

The old scholar laughed, "Is that so?"

Liu Sixteen continued, "In the end, he lost the game, so Cui Shixiong didn’t want to say much more."

It was a homophone for "Zheng."

See, disciples of the Confucian lineage treat others with sincerity.

Then, as they walked along the road, they encountered a handsome young drunkard, who was the supervising official Cao Gengxin, along with the county magistrate Yuan Zhengding, both prominent scions of the Great Li.

Cao, the supervising official, had just finished drinking, with a full wine jar hanging from his waist, swaying as he made his way to the official residence for roll call.

Sometimes, when he was too drunk to walk, he would give a handful of coins to a familiar young worker or call out to a well-known child on the street, paying them to take the wine jar to the supervising official's office and place it on the table, which would count as helping him check in.

The old scholar looked at the young man with a smile.

Cao Gengxin noticed the short elder in a Confucian robe surveying him, but he didn’t greet him and instead turned to the side, swaggering down the street with a laugh, giving a nod of respect to the unfamiliar old gentleman.

The old scholar returned the gesture with a nod.

In this world, not all scholarly officials can be so free-spirited and unrestrained, but at the same time, it is absolutely necessary to have a few like them.

As for the county magistrate Yuan Zhengding, the more, the better.

In the old scholar's eyes, there was no distinction between the two; they were both exceptional young men.

After wandering through many streets of the small town, passing through the somewhat desolate Mud Bottle Lane, they returned to Qilong Lane, where a tall, white-clad figure awaited them on the steps.

The long-lived friend had been waiting for a long time and greeted the old scholar without a word.

The old scholar smiled broadly, and the long-lived friend led them into the auspicious shop, where the old scholar sampled some pastries, and Liu Sixteen also tried a few, although he didn’t dare to overindulge. The previous shopkeeper, Shi Rou, was startled and was about to offer a grand greeting to the "Wensheng Laoye" who seemed to have stepped out from the portrait, but the old scholar waved his hand with a smile, telling her not to bother.

Liu Sixteen spoke with the long-lived friend about some serious matters, and she naturally had no objections. If a few more golden raindrops fell in the North岳 region, the lotus root blessed land's empty seat for the mountain spirit would emerge like bamboo shoots after a rain. Moreover, as the lotus root blessed land had not long been promoted to a medium blessed land, it would soon be able to match the top medium blessed lands in terms of both the number of spirits and the quality of their golden bodies.

Money falling from the sky is indeed a rare occurrence, and if it all fell into one person’s pocket, it would be even more exceptional.

With the long-lived friend overseeing the mountain at Fallen Mountain, the influx of wealth would be unstoppable.

Thus, both before entering and after exiting the Qilong Lane, the old scholar cheerfully expressed his gratitude to her.

The long-lived friend initially cited her responsibilities, but the second time, she habitually accepted it with a smile.

After leaving Qilong Lane, the old scholar said, "Since your little junior brother isn’t around, let’s go meet your little junior brother's close friend. He is certainly one of the ones who protects Chen Ping’an the most."

At the blacksmith shop by the Longxu River, Liu Sixteen met Liu Xianyang, who was lounging on a bamboo chair, soaking up the sun.

After Liu Sixteen introduced himself, Liu Xianyang urged the old scholar to sit quickly while bending over to help the old scholar rub his shoulders, asking whether the pressure was too light or too heavy, all while chatting with Liu Sixteen, saying he and the elder were kin.

The old scholar couldn’t help but chuckle, not specifying what kind of kinship they shared.

Liu Sixteen also found it amusing, not revealing the truth, thus acknowledging the young man’s claim of kinship.

The old scholar squinted his eyes in satisfaction, enjoying the moment, and said to the young man that the pressure felt just right, very comfortable, then the old man imitated the children reading, swaying leisurely as he recited, "In the world, pearls and jade are nothing to be taken; how could they compare to the soil at the head of Yangxian Creek?"

Liu Xianyang gasped, "The poem just bought for our local county records, the elder already knows? It seems your learning is so vast that even the entire Haoran world cannot contain it; at the very least, it must include the fifth realm."

Since he was Chen Ping’an's teacher, he could be considered half a teacher to Liu Xianyang.

Flattery overstepped. 

Liu Sixteen, being tall, could only sit on the steps, his fists resting lightly on his knees, staring ahead as if he hadn’t heard.

However, the old scholar took it seriously, saying, "Such words are best kept among kin; they should not be widely shared, lest they invite envy and resentment."

Liu Xianyang, sitting on the adjacent bamboo chair, declared solemnly, "If the elder says so, it must be that clear and bright character. But we, your student disciples, should seize every opportunity to speak fairly for the elder. Good words are never too many!"

Liu Sixteen couldn’t help but glance at Liu Xianyang, whose face was full of sincerity. This young man had studied under the Confucian Chen family for many years in the Southern Poxing Continent. Reflecting on the scenes at Fallen Mountain, with Wei Shan Jun, the sword immortal, and the girl in the pink skirt named Chen Warm Tree, as well as the little girl in black named Zhou Milin, all seemed well-educated. He felt relieved. As long as his junior brother didn’t pick up Liu Xianyang’s way of speaking, everything would be fine.

The old scholar chatted with Liu Xianyang about some serious academic matters.

Through a question-and-answer format, the old scholar was very pleased. The depth of study and diligence indeed depend on innate talent, yet sincerity and effort do not rely on talent.

Afterward, the old scholar had Liu Xianyang ask questions, leading into another question-and-answer session.

From start to finish, Liu Xianyang sat up straight.

At the end, the old scholar said to the young man, "Xianyang, consider this a lesson for you—think carefully about how to harmonize your foundation for standing and the methods for dealing with the world."

After Liu Xianyang nodded, he stood up, stepping back a few paces, bowing respectfully to the old scholar as a disciple of the Confucian lineage.

The old scholar stood up, smiling and nodding, "I won't return the bow like those later Daoists because I have a question for you, and you haven’t answered. Whatever you gain from now on, I will return the favor later."

As if stepping out of a small world of the Confucian lineage, Liu Xianyang immediately revealed his true self, standing up straight and laughing heartily, "Elder, you flatter me."

Liu Sixteen understood even more than Liu Xianyang.

The teacher's question was a big one.

In fact, the essence of the three teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism shares many similarities in higher and broader contexts.

For example, there was a question in the "Transmission of the Lamp": "What should learners do if they don’t adhere to the earth?" The master replied, "Where do you intend to establish your life?"

The old scholar said, "Let’s go, let’s go."

Liu Sixteen quickly stood up and bowed, "Jun Qian bids farewell to the elder."

The old scholar said, "The emperor loves the eldest son, the common people love the youngest. As your teacher, I cannot help but favor my closed-door disciple a bit more. Jun Qian, do not think too much about it; after all, Chen Ping’an is different from you; he has spent the least time by my side, relies on himself the most, and is still the youngest...”

At this point, the old scholar halted his words, suddenly realizing that even his own closed-door disciple was not so young anymore.

That once-clear-eyed youth, who couldn’t even drink and walked across mountains and rivers in straw shoes, had actually passed his thirties and was now approaching forty.

The old scholar sighed, stamping his foot, and his figure vanished.

Liu Xianyang then offered a handful of sunflower seeds, while Liu Sixteen returned to the steps, shaking his head.

Liu Xianyang took the initiative to say a few words, to which Liu Sixteen nodded or replied concisely with a few words. The two "kin" who had met for the first time began to fall silent, each lost in their thoughts, yet neither felt awkward.

Finally, Liu Sixteen asked, "Earlier, when you were dozing off, I noticed your sword intent flowing through your form. Were you practicing swordsmanship in your dreams?"

Liu Xianyang nodded, casually saying, "There’s an ancestral sword manual with a rather peculiar method of practice; it’s a pity it’s not suitable for Chen Ping’an."

Liu Sixteen said, "I’m friends with Bai Ye. His swordsmanship is quite good. If you encounter a significant bottleneck in your sword cultivation in the future, you can seek him out for sparring. Although Bai Ye has a cold demeanor, he’s actually warm-hearted. When he meets a junior like you, he’ll definitely take notice."

Liu Xianyang turned and clasped his fists with a beaming smile, "Alright, even if the bottleneck isn’t too severe, as long as Bai Ye is willing to teach, I’m eager to learn!"

Liu Sixteen nodded. The young man was not small-minded; he had a big heart. He wouldn’t think he was receiving charity from someone above him, which was excellent.

No wonder he could be friends with his junior brother.

Just like himself and Bai Ye?

Liu Sixteen stood up and bid farewell to Liu Xianyang. He was not one to enjoy talking, especially not polite talk.

Liu Sixteen asked Wei Shan Jun to help conceal his presence as he returned to Fallen Mountain.

He planned to stay here for a while, waiting for the door to the sky to open again, so he could entertain guests.

Having spent a long time at Fallen Mountain, he had become familiar with Wei Ban and even with Mi Yu, who came from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Liu Sixteen inquired about his junior brother’s hidden official matters from the sword immortal Mi Yu.

He felt greatly relieved.

Now, Liu Sixteen was quite knowledgeable about Fallen Mountain.

Although his junior brother often traveled far and rarely stayed in his hometown, he spent more time in foreign lands.

Yet he had still accumulated a vast foundation, which was truly not easy.

Currently, Fallen Mountain's resources, apart from the incense connection with Piyun Mountain’s Wei Shan Jun, purely from the business at the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry, generated quite a bit of income.

It was a pity Liu Sixteen could not meet Zhu Lian, the one nicknamed the Old Chef.

Moreover, the teacher said that his junior brother’s first disciple, Pei Qian, would sooner or later astonish the entire world, which made Liu Sixteen quite curious.

The sword immortal Mi Yu, who went by the alias Yu Mi, had yet to pay respects at the Zushi Hall of the Jisefeng, but in Baoping Continent, a sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall at the Jade Purity level held considerable weight.

However, this sword cultivator was indeed quite lazy.

It was said that through his own ferry, he had purchased many mountain artifacts used to appreciate the mirror flowers and water moons, including white bowls, paintings, inkstones, and letters, gathering more than twenty items for Mi Yu, spending money like water. When Zhou Milin spoke to Liu Sixteen about this, the girl felt heartbroken for Yu Mi, saying that at this rate, it was clear he was heading for a life of celibacy.

The doorkeeper Zheng Dafu, born a pure martial artist, had gone to the fifth realm.

Cen Yuanji, born from the Zushi Hall of Fallen Mountain, was also an unnamed disciple of Zhu Lian. The young girl practiced her punches sincerely, walking back and forth along the road from the mountain top to the foot every day.

Seeing this, Liu Sixteen planned to find an opportunity to discreetly guide her on some boxing techniques in accordance with the mountain’s rules.

The siblings Yuan Bao and Yuan Lai were the direct disciples of Lu Baixiang and had just left Fallen Mountain not long ago. 

Thus, Fallen Mountain became even quieter.

As for the Bai Jian Tai, the Golden Core bottleneck Cui Wei had turned into a Qi Practitioner, and he was now following the path of talismans.

The old man Huan Yun, who wandered here from North Ju Lu Continent, had stayed at Fallen Mountain for a year to teach Cui Wei talisman techniques.

Because Cui Wei was not yet a direct disciple of Fallen Mountain’s Zushi Hall, there were few taboos regarding transmitting teachings. Although there was no formal teacher-student relationship, there was a practical one.

Another peer, Zhang Jiazheng, had not been discouraged by his lack of cultivation aptitude. Instead, he chose to follow the reclusive accountant from the Upside-Down Mountain, Wei Wenlong, to learn about financial calculations.

In the auspicious shop of Qilong Lane, the female ghost Shi Rou wore the skin shed by a powerful ascendant.

As for the long-lived friend, she was even more so.

At the grass-roots shop, the blind Daoist Jia Sheng, Zhao Denggao, and Tian Jiu’er were a trio of master and disciples. That girl, Jiu’er, had blood that made her a natural "symbol spring." Had she not entered Fallen Mountain, her fate would not have been good; it was easy for her to become a cash cow for the mountain deities.

A black snake that migrated from Fallen Mountain to the Grey Mist Mountain for cultivation came from Qizhu Mountain and was now at the Dragon Gate level. 

After transforming into human form, he appeared as a pale-faced youth dressed in a "crow blue" robe, a garment made from snake shedding. 

Going by the name of Yun Zi, his true name was "De Zhang."

Regarding the "true name," which was equivalent to half a life, Liu Milin had said it was the "order" of that big white goose, and Yun Zi dared not disobey.

Fortunately, beyond the bestowed name, that Cui Dongshan had also granted a precious treasure suitable for dragon-type cultivators.

As a mountain spirit-water monster, Yun Zi's rapid breakthrough was related to his innate aptitude, but not significantly; it was mainly thanks to the snake gall stone gifted by Chen Lingjun.

As for the deep-hidden great python from Huanghu Mountain, it was already at the Golden Core bottleneck but had always been unwilling to leave the river.

Wei Ban had revealed to Liu Sixteen that it originally hoped to compete with a certain "little loach" for an opportunity in the Great Way of the Five Elements. Unfortunately, it lost and ultimately could not leave Lihuzhou Cave.

The great python's cultivation aptitude was naturally not poor. It had already been able to transform into human form. However, it seldom revealed itself; when it occasionally appeared in the world, it would show its true form, preferring to lurk at the bottom of the great lake, quietly establishing its own aquatic cave.

The former owner of Huanghu Mountain, who had bought the mountaintop with gold essence copper coins, had no idea that a water monster was lurking at the lake's bottom because the great python had never appeared on land in human form. However, it was unaware of its cultivation level, nor did it comprehend the grand opportunity related to the flow of luck in Lihuzhou Cave. Otherwise, they would never have half-sold and half-given Huanghu Mountain to Fallen Mountain.

The great python now went by the name of Huang Shan Nv, with its true name also gifted by Cui Dongshan, recorded in the genealogy as "Buddha Song." She would occasionally leave the water's edge to meet Zhou Milin.

Zhou Milin still dared not descend the mountain alone, relying on bags of sunflower seeds to trade with Wei Shan Jun, and she was thrown by him to the water's edge of Huanghu Mountain every month.

The Huang Shan Nv, with her eyes like water in the autumn, would leave the water’s edge occasionally. When she did, a faint natural aura of vastness surrounded her.

By the lake stood an old pine tree, also hiding mysteries, with a reclusive aura that had not yet caused any disturbances in the mountains and rivers.

What an old python lying still for a thousand years; when would that old pine not meditate?

Contrasted with Yun Zi, who had a naturally imposing presence, the true form of Huang Shan Nv preferred tranquility over movement. The latter's lair was named Qingni Slope, located in Grey Mist Mountain, meaning "fog poisoning the soaring kite and wind carrying the giant python."

The young man in white had once brought the left protector from Qilong Lane to travel through Huanghu Mountain, and when they reached the water, he laughed, saying a literary master once had a poem: "Leave the dragon beneath the lake; do not test the dog on the street."

Hearing that the great python was lurking underwater, its true head pressed against the mud, the earth dog behind the young man trembled in fear, lying flat and unable to rise.

The vassal Huangting Kingdom and the old Divine Water Kingdom, including Hongzhu Town and Qizhu Mountain, historically belonged to the ancient Shu region, where it was said that the cave of the dragon was endless, attracting sword immortals to appear in the waters, with sword light descending to slay dragons. 

However, Liu Sixteen had no intention of visiting Yun Zi and Huang Shan Nv, not wanting to disturb their cultivation, or rather, not wanting to disrupt their resolve in the Dao. 

After all, among the water spirits in the world, encountering Liu Sixteen was not a good thing for them.

Only that little Milin, who carried a golden shoulder pole and a green bamboo staff, patrolling the mountain morning and night without complaint, even when she spent time with Liu Sixteen each day, seemed to have no issues.

Firstly, this "mute lake great water monster" had a low cultivation level, and secondly, Zhou Milin's heart was clear and pure, hence her lack of trouble.

In addition, some of the figures from Fallen Mountain's Zushi Hall were also not on the mountain.

After Liu Sixteen became familiar with Fallen Mountain, he noticed that from the young mountain lord to the student disciples, and even to the direct disciples of the Zushi Hall and the worshippers, it seemed they were all traveling far and wide.

The atmosphere felt strange.

Ordinary mountains would not be like this.

Martial artists, sword cultivators, Confucian scholars, Daoist qi practitioners, various mountain and marsh spirits, and female ghosts.

Not to mention that special long-lived friend.

But they all got along harmoniously.

How strange. 

Today, Zhou Milin dragged the tall Liu Sixteen to sit on the mountain peak, watching as the clumsy Cen sister practiced her punches down the mountain. Her figure seemed to grow smaller and smaller, which made Milin burst into laughter, covering her mouth with both hands, "Hahaha!"

After laughing, Zhou Milin, without waiting for Pei Qian’s reminder to be more ladylike, felt a bit sad, so she decided to say something cheerful and turned to Liu Sixteen, quietly asking, "Half the mountain lord senior brother, let’s guess some riddles! I know a big basket of them. Not to mention Warm Tree sister, even Pei Qian can’t compare to me; she always can’t figure out the answers and ends up spinning around in a hurry." 

Liu Sixteen smiled, "You ask."

Zhou Milin cleared her throat, "In the sky, there is a drum hidden deep within the clouds. When struck, it thunders; when struck again, it rumbles. What is it?"

Liu Sixteen replied, "It’s thunder."

Zhou Milin gave a thumbs up, then the little girl began to ponder.

Oh dear, she had encountered a master.

Originally planning to remind the tall one, Zhou Milin asked, "There’s a grass on the mountain, and it has plenty of pearls. If I don’t take it with me, you’ll also run in vain..." 

Liu Sixteen chuckled, "It’s dew, right?"

There’s a saying in the books about morning dew, that the past is bitter and lengthy.

Still, there’s luck in being safe, seeing the light again; what wrongs remain, if only morning dew.

Zhou Milin crossed her arms, furrowing her brow, thinking of a more challenging riddle, "There are many chess pieces, and the chessboard is large. We can only watch but can’t play. I ask you, what are the chess pieces?"

Liu Sixteen smiled and shook his head.

He had once traveled beyond the heavens alone, witnessing the form of the Literary Sage, plucking those "chess pieces" to block ancient existences.

Zhou Milin shook her head, grinning, "Is it difficult? If you don’t know, just look up at night, and you’ll know the answer."

Then the little girl looked at the tall one, seemingly a bit forlorn. She said, "Little stone tablet, one by one, standing at the door in two rows." She opened her mouth slightly, chuckling.

Liu Sixteen laughed as he rubbed the little girl’s head, "Got it."

"Being tall and close to the sky, I really envy that." 

Zhou Milin propped her chin, gazing into the distance, her little worries were genuine, "Half the mountain lord senior brother, I’ll tell you a big secret. I actually don’t like patrolling the mountain that much, but every day on the mountain, chewing sunflower seeds with nothing to do, I can’t help. What do you think? So every time I patrol, I run really fast; I’m secretly slacking off."

Liu Sixteen nodded, "I’ll help you keep it a secret."

Zhou Milin moved closer and whispered, "Then I’ll tell you a colossal secret. Back when I traveled the rivers with the good mountain lord in the North Ju Lu Continent..."

The little girl set her green bamboo staff and golden shoulder pole aside, then stood up, saying, "I was standing in a big backpack, whacking Pei Qian’s head with all my might. Chen the good man said one snowflake coin is worth one chestnut, and I didn’t even blink."

Liu Sixteen chuckled knowingly, saying earnestly, "Then you’re truly impressive; being able to hit my junior brother’s chestnut, if that gets out, the reputation of the mute lake great water monster will indeed be as big as the sky."

Originally spirited Zhou Milin’s expression dimmed suddenly, "Those riddles were all taught to me by him. If he doesn’t come home soon, I might forget one or two."

Liu Sixteen suddenly wanted to stretch his legs and take a trip to the barbaric world, to see that junior brother who could make the teacher laugh, and then just say he passed through here from Baoping Continent.

So on the city wall, would his junior brother inquire with his gaze, "You come from your hometown; you should know the affairs of your hometown"?

Liu Sixteen sighed heavily, wishing he had asked the teacher whether it was feasible. 

In an instant, Liu Sixteen vanished from where he stood.

Zhou Milin blinked vigorously. Where had the tall one run off to? She had no harder riddles left.

Liu Sixteen stood on a golden arched bridge, slightly furrowing his brow.

Then he saw a tall woman in white, leaning on her sword, slowly turning to look at him.

She had a pair of the most exquisite golden eyes in the world.

Liu Sixteen remained silent for a moment, puzzled, "Why are you still here?"

The fearless Liu Sixteen did not take a step forward.

The reason was simple: when Liu Sixteen was young, he had dealt with her and suffered greatly. 

He glanced at the long sword in her hand and continued to ask, "Aren’t you without a sword attendant anymore?"

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 834: When the Time Comes, Heaven and Earth Will Move Together

Liu Sixteen didn’t find his time on the mountain particularly boring. In this dilapidated place, where the mountain lord was temporarily absent, it was like a gentleman hiding his talents, waiting for the right moment to act.

If there is a way in the world, it will be seen; if there is no way, it will be hidden. As far as this saying goes, it seemed that in this dilapidated mountain, the way had not yet appeared. When the world was in turmoil, no one wanted to remain here, preferring to descend the mountain instead. However, not everything had been revealed yet, and Liu Sixteen was in no rush. Besides, with his little junior brother's choices and actions, as an older brother, he could not demand much more.

Thus, as an outsider to the dilapidated mountain, Liu Sixteen's impression of it continued to improve.

Yet, Liu Sixteen harbored a great doubt in his heart. The person he had encountered before—was she the sword attendant who had once followed that supreme existence to conquer the realms, now known in later generations as the Spirit of the Immortal Sword? Or was she actually the true master of that sword attendant, having intentionally changed her appearance to deceive future generations? Because in Liu Sixteen’s view, sword attendants, or sword spirits, did not exist, at least not as complete beings.

He had asked her, but unfortunately, she did not provide an answer.

Her gaze remained as indifferent as ever, showing no trace of disdain.

Today, Mi Yu did not accompany Xiao Mi Li on her patrol of the mountain. Instead, he went to the top of the steps and found Liu Sixteen sitting on the ground.

Mi Yu sat beside him and said, “With you here at the peak of the dilapidated mountain, I can relax.”

Mi Yu was planning to take a trip to Old Dragon City with his sword.

He took the sword nurturing gourd “Hao Liang” from his waist and smiled, “I’m not seeking death, but just in case, I’d like to trouble Liu Sixteen to pass it on to my long-life friend. I won’t go to Qi Long Lane and end up with nothing.”

Liu Sixteen shook his head, “I won’t stay too long.”

Suddenly reminded of something, he thought of that existence from the Yang family pharmacy, the proximity of the dilapidated mountain to the Cloud-Piercing Mountain, as well as that woman from the Longquan Sword Sect.

Liu Sixteen changed his mind. “Sword Immortal, be extra cautious. When I head south and reach Old Dragon City, I’ll make sure to support you. Then you can return to the dilapidated mountain.”

Mi Yu felt a bit helpless. Being referred to as "Sword Immortal" by Liu Sixteen felt more like an insult than a compliment.

What troubled Mi Yu more was that he had to remind Liu Sixteen once again, “My surname is Mi.”

Would it be too much to ask to call me Mi Sword Immortal instead? 

Liu Sixteen laughed heartily, “Alright, Mi Sword Immortal.”

Feeling somewhat relieved, Mi Yu gazed into the distance at the scenery beyond the mountain and smiled, “Then I will shamelessly accept your kindness. At the battlefield in Old Dragon City, I will count the days and wait for your arrival.”

Liu Sixteen inexplicably recalled the young man he had seen practicing swordsmanship in his dreams.

The man was increasingly worried. It seemed that everyone around his little junior brother had thick skins. Familiarity among acquaintances was a good thing, but this level of being overly familiar was rather rare, wasn’t it?

According to his teacher, his little junior brother’s character was one of gentleness, propriety, thrift, and humility, never missing a single word. He was the most able to adhere to etiquette; when there were few people, he felt free in the heart, and when there were many, he became even more cautious. He pursued a refined scholarly demeanor, striving to become a great scholar, and displayed the charisma of a hero...

His teacher’s words were always to the point during their four years of studying together and would never exaggerate his disciples. Just like back then, when faced with the tidal wave of praise from the outside world for the three disciples of the Literary Sage, his teacher merely said, “My little Qi’s scholarship is alright, but he is still far from being a true sage. Don’t push him too hard, old folks.”

He would say that Cui Zhan’s calligraphy was acceptable, and his chess skills were mediocre; he never managed to win against the city lord of White Emperor City.

As for the swordsmanship of the senior brother on the left, he learned it late, and the reason he had some skills was merely due to luck. A guy who couldn’t even be considered a sword master wouldn’t have much future, would he?

After the senior brother on the left got into trouble, his teacher had even more to say. “You all have higher status; there’s no need to be angry with a junior. I’ll deal with him when I return. Why glare? He doesn’t understand etiquette at all. Quickly apologize to the seniors, be sincere, and bow your head a little more…”

Mi Yu understood in his heart, but he was also too lazy to mend the fence; it could easily backfire.

The tall and robust Liu Sixteen sitting next to him looked simple and honest, but he definitely could not be regarded as someone without a heart.

Although Mi Yu was a sword cultivator born and raised in the Sword Qi Long Wall, he had seen quite a few gentlemen and sages and thus found it embarrassing to say some of the strange phrases from the Sword Qi Long Wall, such as “From afar, it looks like A Liang; up close, it’s the Hidden Official.”

While it was true that in his hometown, the Hidden Official had never lost a debate, whether inside or outside the summer palace of the Sword Qi Long Wall or in the Upside-Down Mountain at Spring Fan Studio, he could not control what others said behind his back.

Moreover, countless hired hands from those wine shops and gambling dens openly criticized the second manager who was responsible for delivering money, as if they were fiercer than anyone else.

After all, Liu Sixteen was the senior brother of the Hidden Official. Some things were not suitable for Mi Yu, an outsider from the literary faction, to comment on.

If Mi Yu were truly foolish, would he still be the Mi Sword Immortal capable of provoking countless romantic entanglements?

Liu Sixteen said, “You should be able to guess, I come from a demonic lineage.”

Mi Yu nodded, “I’ve seen a lot; it’s not surprising.”

In discussing this matter, Mi Yu seemed quite the sword immortal.

Liu Sixteen fell silent.

On the dilapidated mountain, a small girl in black, bouncing and skipping, first accompanied Sister Nuan Shu to clean up the Ancestor Hall at the Misty Peak and then set off on her own to patrol the mountain. Today she was in a good mood, probably because she had made new friends; she wasn’t running as fast as usual. Right now, she was happily calling out to a little girl sitting in the water. Dressed in a red outfit, she was in a boat but not rowing. It was hard to tell what she was, a little red altar filled with red dumplings. It was all too puzzling...

Liu Sixteen rested his hands on his knees. “Sword Immortal, I won’t see you off. In the future, when we meet again in Old Dragon City, we won’t have need for farewells after drinking.”

Mi Yu smiled bitterly, “My surname is Mi.”

Then he broke into a smile, “Little Nuan Shu and Xiao Mi Li, please take care of them, Liu Sixteen.”

“Rest assured, Sword Immortal, with me around, there’s no need to worry.”

Liu Sixteen’s promise was made with a carefree demeanor.

He then laughed and patted Mi Yu on the shoulder, “You’re a good person!”

Mi Yu no longer cared about being called Sword Immortal without the character for Mi, realizing it was futile to fuss over it.

The Sword Immortal in the green robe rose gracefully, clasped his fists with Liu Sixteen, and then flew away on his sword, instantly vanishing into the southern horizon. He was worried that Xiao Mi Li might see him and be sad; knowing too soon would only lead to sadness. So Mi Yu deliberately restrained his aura and the spectacle of sword flight, letting the light of the sword vanish in a flash.

Yet Mi Yu did not yet know how Liu Sixteen’s “a good person” would be evaluated.

Earlier, Liu Sixteen had spoken with Liu Xianyang about his friend Bai Ye.

That “friend Bai Ye, skilled in swordsmanship”...

Liu Sixteen continued to bide his time, waiting for the heavens to open up again.

Mountain Lord Wei Ba had a strong sense of justice. As the older brother of the mountain lord, Liu Sixteen was bound to help his little junior brother exchange some favors.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to face his teacher again.

Liu Sixteen suddenly laughed, “Little junior brother, you’re truly hiding your talents too much. Have you already been looked down upon by many people?”

The few night banquets at Cloud-Piercing Mountain, the steward of the dilapidated mountain, Zhu Lian, and the Chen Ling who came from Yujiang had all made appearances. As for Pei Qian, Chen Nuan Shu, and Zhou Mi Li, when they went to Cloud-Piercing Mountain, they stayed far away, merely there for the excitement. At the night banquets crowded with immortal masters, city gods, and mountain deities, the three little girls did not attract much attention.

In the realm of Beiyue, the impression of the dilapidated mountain, which had opened its doors after Longquan Sword Sect, was still quite deep, aside from the fact that the young mountain lord hailed from the shabby Li Zhu Cave Heaven, it was more so due to the admiration from the Northern Mountain Lord Wei Ba. This made it quite enviable. Beyond that, the relationship between the dilapidated mountain and Longquan Sword Sect was well-known, as they had rented three mountain peaks. This was an acknowledged fact. The key was the rumor that the young mountain lord, who had risen from the bottom of society, had a close affinity with the only daughter of the Saint, Ruan Xiu. This matter circulated with some credibility, and since neither the Saint Ruan Qiong nor the daughter Ruan Xiu had ever seriously denied it, it became quite intriguing.

With the backing of Ruan Qiong and the protection of Wei Ba, the young man with the surname Chen from the dilapidated mountain, who had always remained hidden, was able to soar to great heights, rapidly rising to become a notable immortal sect within the old territory of Dali.

Possessing half of the Niujiao Mountain ferry and occupying all the ruins left behind by the Bagua Pavilion, he had even appointed the Golden Core female immortal Liu Chongrun to personally manage the ferry “Fan Mo.”

It’s just a pity that this dilapidated mountain was a mere facade, lacking any capable cultivator to represent it.

It was said that the young man named Chen Ping An was still just a pure martial artist, not even someone who practiced cultivation.

The territory was not small, but there were too few people. As the largest landlord in the territory of Li Zhu Cave Heaven back in the day, there never was a unique figure who could stabilize the situation.

For the past twenty-plus years, they had been hiding under the shade of Cloud-Piercing Mountain and Longquan Sword Sect, like an old lute half concealed.

Being looked down upon by outsiders seemed to be a matter of course.

Liu Sixteen chuckled as a small girl in black quickly ran up the steps to the mountain peak, stopping to pretend to be out of breath.

Liu Sixteen was tall enough to lightly pat Xiao Mi Li’s back while sitting.

Zhou Mi Li sat beside him and asked, “Want some sunflower seeds?”

Liu Sixteen shook his head.

Zhou Mi Li sighed, “Then I won’t eat them either.” 

After sitting with the tall figure for a long while, Zhou Mi Li said she was going to see a friend and excused herself, running off.

She took out three small bags of sunflower seeds and gently called out, “Lord Wei, Lord Wei!”

Wei Ba appeared near the mountain god temple, received the three bags of seeds, and smiled, “Are you heading to Huanghu Mountain or Huimeng Mountain?”

Zhou Mi Li felt a bit guilty today, holding her green bamboo staff and golden small shoulder pole together, extending a palm as she said, “Lord Wei, I know you’re busy with important matters. Today is the last time, I promise!”

Wei Ba put the seeds into his sleeve and smiled, “For now, there’s no need for that. If something really happens, calling won’t be of much use. So whether there’s something or not, shouting at the dilapidated mountain is all the same.”

Zhou Mi Li shook her head, “I said this is the last time I’m troubling you, Lord Wei. It must count. Today I’m going to Huanghu Mountain to visit Sister Hongxia.”

Wei Ba could only nod and “sent” the little girl toward Huanghu Mountain.

That great python, known as the Lady in Yellow, whose real name was Fo Song, preferred to call herself “Hongxia” only in front of Zhou Mi Li.

Zhou Mi Li set down her shoulder pole and bamboo staff, needing to take a few deep breaths as before to muster the courage to lean over the water. The little girl dipped her head into the water, eyes wide open.

After a long while, she still couldn’t see Sister Hongxia.

In a light yellow dress, Sister Hongxia was actually smiling and standing on the shore, crouching down beside Zhou Mi Li, gently patting her head.

Poor little Mi Li was so startled that she dove into the water, flailing her hands randomly, instantly disappearing dozens of feet underwater.

Sister Hongxia felt a bit guilty for a moment.

After a while, when she surfaced, her eyes were watery from crying because her belongings were left on the shore. But soon the little girl grinned and burst into laughter.

She was here, grinning widely, completely unconcerned.

Zhou Mi Li bounced out of the water, splashing as she walked, crouched down, and seriously comforted her, “Don’t be scared, don’t be scared, I was just teasing you.”

Sister Hongxia thought for a moment but still didn’t ask Zhou Mi Li about the faint, terrifying aura from the dilapidated mountain.

Involving the Dao, such matters were of utmost importance, and she shouldn’t pull the little girl into it.

So Sister Hongxia simply smiled and said, “Which martial arts story do you want to tell me today?”

Zhou Mi Li chuckled, “With a shout, the mountains and waters turn green. I don’t know, have you heard it?”

Sister Hongxia laughed, “I’ve heard of it.”

Zhou Mi Li froze for a moment, realizing she hadn’t opened the door to good fortune today.

Sister Hongxia suddenly felt a great fear. This was the first time the culprit who made her not dare to think about the journey of the rivers and lakes had come to Huanghu Mountain.

Longquan Sword Sect, the woman Ruan Xiu.

This was someone who seemed to have “ascended” to the heavenly realm of Baopingzhou and had personally killed an ancient deity.

Fortunately, there was still a clueless Zhou Mi Li who saw the very lovable Sister Xiu and waved vigorously, “Sister Xiu, want some sunflower seeds!”

Ruan Xiu smiled and slowly walked to Xiao Mi Li’s side, bending down to rub the little girl’s head, taking a big handful of seeds from her.

Ruan Xiu shot a sidelong glance at the trembling Sister Hongxia and asked in mind voice: “You’re just going to remain a part of the dilapidated mountain, living off others? Aren’t you planning to leave the lake and go explore the rivers? Do you plan on waiting for me to die first?”

Sister Hongxia turned pale.

How could she dare to have such thoughts?

It would be a great injustice to her.

Ruan Xiu said, “After I leave, you should go explore the rivers immediately.”

Sister Hongxia’s teeth chattered, and she could only nod gently.

In fact, she wasn’t even sure if she genuinely nodded.

Zhou Mi Li blinked and looked at Sister Xiu munching on sunflower seeds, then looked back at Sister Hongxia, softly asking, “Sister Xiu, why does Sister Hongxia seem a bit afraid of you?”

Ruan Xiu laughed, “She’s timid. Even more so than Mi Li.”

Zhou Mi Li wanted to laugh, but since Sister Xiu was talking about Sister Hongxia, she couldn’t laugh and didn’t forget to wave her hand in front of Sister Hongxia, signaling that nothing was wrong.

Ruan Xiu said, “Shall we go play at Divine Show Mountain?”

Zhou Mi Li hesitated, “I just got here, and I haven’t chatted with Sister Hongxia much yet.”

Ruan Xiu said, “Then you talk first; I’ll sit nearby.”

In the end, the little girl in black sat in the middle.

Sister Hongxia wouldn’t dare sit beside Ruan Xiu.

After hearing a story about a mute lake, Ruan Xiu opened her handkerchief, took a piece of pastry, and handed it to Xiao Mi Li.

Zhou Mi Li immediately understood, shook her head, and began to eat the pastry.

Then she would tell a story about the good mountain lord!

There were plenty of stories; she had a huge basket full.

Like the last time she talked about how Chen Haoren encountered a mountain spirit and failed to compose poetry, resulting in them being driven out of the cave, Sister Xiu would be very happy, as it was the first time Zhou Mi Li had seen her smile like that.

At that time, Sister Xiu went from beautiful to breathtaking.

Yang’s Pharmacy. Liu Sixteen was invited to help guard the formation.

Old Yang had also called for Ruan Xiu.

Liu Sixteen was genuinely feeling a bit helpless.

It was one thing not to run into them before, but now facing them, it was indeed strange.

Not to mention the addition of that “Li Liu,” with whom they had a significant past but ended up on opposing paths due to the Dao.

What’s going on in this place where his little junior brother has grown up?

Old Yang tucked his old smoking pipe into his waistband and suddenly looked at Ruan Xiu, taking off the pipe and saying, “Here, help me pass this to him.”

Ruan Xiu nodded and took the old smoking pipe that Old Yang tossed over.

Liu Sixteen’s eyes lit up, a smile appearing on his face.

In the past, among their literary lineage, Liu Sixteen’s three senior brothers were all exceptional individuals, yet each had guarded their integrity as if it were precious. Many women admired them, both on the mountain and below. While it might not be said that there were as many as there are fish crossing the river, there were certainly quite a few.

It was just that the eldest brother, Cui Zhan, was ambitious and focused, and although he would never deliberately alienate or reject women, he would only treat them with courtesy at most.

The other senior brother thought women were annoying and would often wonder why they liked him. “You all like Cui Zhan or Qi Jingchun, go after them instead.”

Little Qi was simply clueless.

After Liu Sixteen and Ruan Xiu, Mountain Lord Wei Ba was also called over. This Northern Mountain landlord had a serious expression.

Wei Ba stood beside Liu Sixteen, who had cast an illusion, and previously, he had occasionally inquired. Wei Ba had publicly claimed that he was just an old friend from Cloud-Piercing Mountain.

As for whether anyone believed it, Wei Ba didn’t care.

After all, he wasn’t saying to outsiders that he wouldn’t hold any more night banquets.

Wei Ba asked, “Is there a need for the younger generation to move the mountains and rivers?”

Old Yang shook his head, “I know a thing or two about divine powers.”

Wei Ba was speechless.

Liu Sixteen smiled. This old man, who had never been one to joke around, was getting better at chatting.

The world had not been idle for ten thousand years.

In an instant, the entire Northern Mountain realm appeared shrouded in white mist in the eyes of cultivators. As for ordinary folks, they remained oblivious.

Today was a momentous day, unprecedented in ten thousand years.

Because this old Yang, who had been guarding the human realm for ten thousand years, was about to reopen the Ascension Platform for the ancient Qing Tong Heavenly Lord in the human realm.

Still, it was unclear how Old Yang would operate his divine powers. The celestial beings who quietly rushed to various places in Longzhou instantly felt as if they were standing on a high platform.

It was too bizarre, to the point that many Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators exchanged glances, but soon stabilized their minds and steadied their Dao hearts.

On the high platform, there were old men dwelling in the mountains and exceptional young people from the mountains.

This large group of Golden Core and Nascent Soul immortals from Baopingzhou, who had previously received a secret order from the Dali Criminal Department, contained shocking content. The last line of the secret letter was extremely stern, forbidding them from leaking a word and only allowing them to secretly head to Longzhou in Dali.

The Taoist priests from the Divine Revelation Sect, the martial cultivators from Zhenwu Mountain and the Wind and Snow Temple, Jiang Yun from the Jiang family, the two old sword cultivators from Zhengyang Mountain, and the head of the Xu family from Qingfeng City...

The eldest disciple of Longquan Sword Sect, Dong Gu, and Xie Ling. The Golden Core swordsman Cui Wei from the dilapidated mountain, the Golden Core cultivator Cai Jin Jian from Yunxia Mountain...

There was even a sword cultivator from Fenglei Garden, Liu Baqiao, returning to Longzhou.

The master of the garden, Huang He, even after receiving the order from Dali, directly gave up this opportunity for a great Dao fortune, only allowing Liu Baqiao to set off, saying to his disciple, “In my life, I only practice the sword alone, without accepting the favors of anyone other than my master.”

Liu Baqiao advised him a few times, but Huang He finally said to him, “You’re not as talented as I am. For the next hundreds of years, I want to focus on sword cultivation, and if you, the new garden master, fall short in realm, you’ll embarrass my master and Fenglei Garden. You don’t have the right to bargain with me, so hurry up and get to Longzhou in Dali.”

Earlier, the direct disciple of the Zhengyang Mountain ancestor, Yuan Bai, had asked the garden master of Fenglei Garden, Huang He, for a duel. Yuan Bai summoned his life sword jade stone, turning it into ashes.

As a result, even though Huang He did not fall in rank to the Golden Core, it was undeniable that his Dao was damaged. Even so, as long as he arrived in Longzhou, he had a chance to recover his Nascent Soul’s fullness. Given Huang He’s natural talent, perhaps he could even step into the upper five realms.

But Huang He still refused to come here.

The lower sect of the Yuanguang Sect, the true realm sect, had just broken through the bottleneck of the Dragon Gate realm, including the sword cultivator Sui You, totaling three people.

In a chaotic world, there will be countless heroes and tyrants rising to the occasion, each displaying their talents.

In the backyard of the pharmacy, Liu Sixteen said, “I’ll just go to the heavenly realm first, to avoid getting flustered and not receiving guests properly. Welcoming guests at the door is more sincere.”

Ruan Xiu had just finished her pastry, clapped her hands, and said, “Likewise.”

Old Yang nodded.

---

The National Master of Dali, the Confucian scholar Cui Zhan, supported the White Jade Capital, with the body of a celestial being seated in heaven.

Cui Zhan lightly uttered a word.

“Sever.”

In an instant, the sword light reached every corner within Cui Zhan’s sight.

He severed the head of a great demon in the realm of the celestial.

In the realm of the Five Mountains, all the borders of rivers and mountains, all the counties, towns, and cities far from the battlefield of Dali, had numerous incense burners set up to worship the Five Mountains, led by local civil and military officials along with the common people, who would offer incense day and night. The local city gods and auxiliary officials, along with the spirits of heroes from civil and military backgrounds, and the deities of mountains and rivers, were responsible for examining and weighing the essence of the incense, reporting it to the Ministry of Rites and compiling it.

At this moment, countless poems and songs arose from Baopingzhou, called Five Mountain Poems, with a hundred selected and compiled into a book, distributed to various academies and village schools across the continent, allowing children everywhere to sing them in the streets.

With the Five Mountain Lords, the essence of incense continuously flowed into the Great Mountain, half of which was intercepted to maintain the towering golden body of the divine form, while the remaining two-fifths were given to the Mountain of the Crown Prince, and the remaining three-fifths were distributed to many mountain and river shrines within the borders, providing sustenance to the fortune of various vassal states, boosting the national fortune, extending the nation's longevity, and ultimately enhancing the national power, which in turn fed back into the Dali Dynasty and the greater fortunes of the continent.

The Tongye Continent was where the emperor fled, and the immortals escaped.

But in Baopingzhou, even the children in the streets and rural areas could contribute silently to the stability of the continent’s fortunes through their innocent singing.

Dali had changed its laws, allowing each vassal state to select two or four spirits, to post “family” door gods on their doors, reconstructing the golden bodies to protect their regions, preventing the sporadic invasions from the demonic tribes, and working together with local immortal cultivators and the national clan offerings to jointly layout defenses against the disturbances of the demonic tribes.

At a mountain peak, far from Cui Zhan's divine form in the middle of Baopingzhou, a dozen people looked down at the rivers and mountains.

Leading them was Mr. Fan, the founder of the merchant family, guiding a group of ancestral masters of merchants who had come to Baopingzhou.

Despite not being too young in appearance, after Cui Zhan drew his sword, the merchant ancestor withdrew his gaze and sighed, “Distant waters seek distant mountains. Old friends leave behind stories.”

After reflecting on the world for a moment, this “Mr. Fan” turned to the point, smiling, “Everyone says water follows the mountains, and the flow of rivers in the world is unpredictable, while only mountains remain still. Is it really just the water that moves and not the mountains?”

An old man who had accompanied him for many years laughed, “Lack of money, right?”

This person was the one who had once beset A Liang and managed to escape, cheerfully giving himself the nickname “Half Peak.”

This group of merchants, who were rich enough to rival nations, burst into hearty laughter upon hearing this.

Indeed, they didn’t lack anything but money.

The merchants had already spent a substantial sum to relocate inland mountains to the coast, creating strongholds, or moving some coastal mountains that posed an inconvenience to the Dali cavalry inland, forming what appeared to be “naturally formed yet actually artificially created” formidable battle lines!

Next, they would have to spend even more! Money from the immortals, money from the Grain Rain! 

Snowflake money, Lesser Heat money? There certainly wasn’t a single one; too shabby!

In summary, the merchants needed to ensure that the vassal troops of Baopingzhou, lacking cavalry, could hold the strongholds.

Moreover, they needed to clear out space for Dali’s unstoppable iron cavalry to gallop freely across the vast plains.

Mr. Fan smiled and said, “Everyone, hurry up and scatter money across the continent.”

One by one, they obediently followed the ancestor’s order, disappearing into the world like the wind.

On the battlefield of Old Dragon City, several divine beings had descended, unstoppable.

Ma Kuxuan had merely returned to Zhenwu Mountain, one of the ancestral homes of the martial family in Baopingzhou. Shortly after returning to Old Dragon City, he encountered celestial beings descending from the heavens, visiting Baopingzhou.

As one of the ten young candidates of the world, Ma Kuxuan, he was also commanding a dozen ancient divine beings to reciprocate, attacking the heavens.

Moreover, there was the Southern Mountain Lord, the only female mountain lord, Fan Junmao, whose golden body was over a thousand feet tall. She held a portion of the ancient moon “Truth” as a bow, a gift from the Lady Gui, using the essence of the sun and moon as arrows and bowstring.

When an arrow was shot, whether it was aimed at the heavens to slay ancient gods or to strike great demons at sea, it carried earth-shattering might.

On the Dragon-Ascending Platform near Old Dragon City, there was a young girl, Zhi Gui, whose golden eyes were fixed on a great demon far out at sea.

The demon was also staring back at Zhi Gui.

Zhi Gui grinned and slowly raised a hand, making a gesture of breaking the neck toward that scarlet concubine.

At Shujian Lake.

A refined old man in a tall crown and flowing robe stood at the water’s edge on an island.

The patriarch of the True Realm Sect, Wei Ying, felt something stir within him but refrained from using his powers to peer into the distance.

Hundreds of strange spirits, without exception, were all grievances of those who had died violently, still retaining a hint of true spirit even after a hundred or a thousand years. They surged out of the lake and returned to the human realm.

In their lifetimes, they were all individuals who had died tragically in this lawless land of Shujian Lake, their souls lingering due to various injustices. Some were innocent, some deserved their fates, and some had died unfairly even though their crimes did not merit death, and now they gathered around the old man, watching the bustling world of Shujian Lake, year after year, as life and death remained uncertain, the strong violently killing the weak, and the weak not knowing what they had done wrong, simply feeling that their cultivation was too low, and nothing more.

Ultimately, all these spirits shared a common confusion: which was the mortal realm, and which was the realm of the dead?

Finally, a weary young man from another land arrived here, answering the question lingering in the hearts of countless restless spirits.

Gu Can’s killing was wrong, and not killing Gu Can was also wrong. This custom of Shujian Lake, which would still be wrong a thousand or ten thousand years later, was indeed incorrect. Some wrongdoings and the discomfort in one’s heart must cause one to suffer for a lifetime.

Because in this world, wrong is wrong. If there is a wrong, one must correct it. This has always been the case, right? Should we let generations of future people continue to question this? Surely not, that wouldn’t do.

Those wronged spirits, who had also offered their answers, bid farewell to the young man one by one.

They, along with that young man, provided Shujian Lake with an answer, a response that would still be filled with sorrow and regret.

“Skinny as a bamboo pole, how will you ever find a wife in the future? Once you leave this ghostly place, remember to eat plenty of fish and meat! I’m not bragging; my cooking is excellent. I’m known for my messy stew that can make the Buddha jump the wall; too bad you don’t have that luck.”

“Chen Ping An, take it easy; let’s not reunite too early. Also, you, this useless accountant, remember to slap Gu Can a few times to vent your frustration. You’ve gotten yourself into trouble with this Gu Can, you’ve really hit rock bottom. In the future, mind your own business; it’s not worth it.”

“Mr. Chen, I still feel the world isn’t too beautiful, but… it seems there’s still a bit of hope. I’ll take my leave now, and do take care, Mr. Chen.”

The young man, who had only just started to leave his youth behind, smiled and waved goodbye to them, hoarsely uttering a few words of well-wishing. When he could not speak, he would lightly knock his chest with a fist or clasp his hands in farewell.

After those spirits vanished, the young man fell into deeper silence.

The old man was not only acknowledging the young man’s troubles and efforts to make amends but also felt gratified that the parting was filled with regret yet not completely hopeless.

The old man collected his thoughts, smiling, “Since you can still hold onto a spark of spirit, it means you’re not completely numb. That’s why you’re being held here and unable to be released. This time, your souls will dissipate completely, and I’ll accumulate some merit for you. For every wrong, a right will counterbalance it, and as for your fortune, accumulate it.”

With the old man’s words, those spirits felt a sense of great relief, as if they had received a pardon, transforming into golden-bodied water deities.

Before this, Dali had already laid down a land route for these spirits, allowing them to travel like the righteous deities of the lake, heading towards the center of Baopingzhou.

The old man smiled again, “All the spirits of mountains and rivers in the world are my friends, aren’t they?”

The old man asked himself and answered, “If not, then so be it!”

Countless mountain spirits suddenly condensed their forms across the mountains and peaks of the continent.

The old man lifted one hand, “Heaven is showing signs.”

From all corners of the continent, there were a total of twenty-four peaks, where a young man in white had buried twenty-four bamboo slips in advance.

The spirit army surged forth, like an unprecedented ghost army crossing the borders, riding the winds toward those twenty-four peaks.

The old man finally approached the ferry at Qingxia Island, looking down.

After that young man had fallen into a deep sleep, Ruan Xiu and Zhong Kui had come to visit him, who was snoring thunderously on the ground. 

In fact, it was not just the two of them.

The old man chuckled, what a world full of wonders.

When he looked up again, he saw that Baopingzhou had no grand formations of the Three Altars and Four Symbols, but it did have this even more magnificent and more aligned with the Dao’s grand formation of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Seasons.

The great formation followed the cycles of the heavens and protected the entire continent without any gaps.

A middle-aged monk, wandering with a begging bowl, had traveled around this continent year after year.

He began to chant. 

Wherever he had stepped in the past, in the cities, between the mountains and rivers, in bustling places and secluded spots, the lotus flowers began to bloom.

In the end, across the continent, Baopingzhou resembled a beautiful flower vase on some table, with a large golden lotus blooming within.

Twelve massive sword boats hovered at the forefront of the battlefield, suspended behind Old Dragon City.

Countless martial forces used secret methods to beat drums, amplifying the momentum, adding a mysterious celestial time to the flying swords.

On the flying swords, there were already talismanic cultivators pouring their hearts and souls into inscribing intricate cloud patterns onto every single sword, sparing no expense in both immortal money and spiritual essence.

In an instant, the flying swords clustered together densely like a torrential rain, directed toward the demonic army attacking the city at sea.

The smallest region of the vast territory, Baopingzhou, was the only one that not only maintained a solid defense but also had the strength to engage in grand offensives against the barbaric world.

Prince Song Jixin did not station at the grand Dali capital of Baopingzhou, nor did he move his residence to the comparatively stable Southern Mountain. He remained in Old Dragon City, acting as one of the pillars of the southern battlefield alongside the two highest-ranking military officials of Dali, Inspector Cao Ping and General Su Gaoshan. However, the two generals were not inside the city but rather on the land outside Old Dragon City, waiting in full battle formation.

And the once noble son of the Dali family, Song Mu, who was no longer the pampered young man from Mud Bottle Lane, was now clenching his fists, his eyes red. The war had continued for a year, and the prince showed no signs of retreating, having heard that the barbaric world had once challenged the Sword Qi Long Wall with tens of thousands of sword cultivators.

Standing at the top of the prince’s estate, Song Jixin pressed his hands against the railing, the veins on his hands bulging, and laughed angrily, “Come! Let’s fight another round with the Dali!”

A gentleman from the Guankong Academy arrived in Old Dragon City and, before departing, exchanged bows with the headmaster of the academy, preparing to head to the front lines.

The gentleman held a jade porcelain bottle, crystal clear, seemingly filled with thunder and lightning, resembling a small thunder pool.

In fact, the thunder within the bottle was a manifestation of his scholarly Dao’s subtle essence.

After saying farewell to the headmaster, he shared a light-hearted remark with a younger disciple from the same hometown.

“Next year when the flowers bloom in our hometown, be sure to take a few more glances for me.”

A scholar from the academy, with whom he had previously had disputes and even fierce arguments, happened to be traveling to the battlefield with him.

It turned out that the disputes over knowledge among scholars were truly just the disputes of gentlemen.

Gentlemen and sages, the two exchanged smiles, sharing an unspoken understanding.

The chief offering of the Fu family in Old Dragon City, an old swordsman who had practiced for many years near the Dragon Ascending Platform, walked alongside a woodsman from the Sun family, both taking leave from their respective lords to rush to the most perilous areas of the battlefield.

As the two rode the wind, the woodsman, who had once read the sacred texts but had never become a disciple of the academy, remarked with a hint of a smile, “The green mud is winding, twisting and turning a hundred steps, it doesn’t matter if my heart is full of mud and mire; that isn’t a reason for you beasts to barge in.”

The old swordsman laughed, “You’re too pretentious, I can’t say it, so I’ll just follow your words. Let’s say it’s a dying wish: to cross this road, to enter the family gates, I must die first.”

An old cultivator who had safely left Tongye Continent, an old Nascent Soul who had once struck a big deal with the young man from another land and Jiang Shangzhen, gathered all the cultivators of his sect.

The old man’s sect was located in the northern part of Tongye Continent, known as the Qinghu Palace of Tianque Peak, and the old man himself was the master alchemist, Lu Yong.

Before the barbaric world’s demons had even landed, the well-informed and self-preserving Master Lu had already led his disciples onto the immortal ferry, escaping to Baopingzhou ahead of time. If they had waited another ten days, they would have faced a closed door.

However, like all the other clever people, even after entering the territory of Old Dragon City, they hadn’t been able to secure refuge in the city, so they had to gather with other foreign cultivators, as if they were prisoners.

But they had saved their lives, although life was still not easy.

The military cultivators of the Dali Dynasty never spoke a word to them; they either killed those who didn’t follow the rules or coldly watched these Tongye Continent refugees from a distance.

The different military cultivators shared the same gaze.

No sympathy, only the innate coldness brought by the battlefield, and the ridicule of looking at something that wasn’t exactly human.

However, in the high buildings of the “cage,” there was leisure to observe the battlefield without obstruction, which was not hindered by Dali.

After the old man witnessed the daily brutal battles outside Old Dragon City, he gradually spoke less. Until today, Lu Yong suddenly became furious, his beard standing on end, “How dare you uproot my family’s thousand-year-old tree?!”

Finally, the old Nascent Soul smiled sadly, leaving his disciples with the words to live well in this foreign land. After all, they had just barely made it here; they shouldn’t die easily, no matter how embarrassing it was. They should focus on their cultivation and refine better pills.

In the end, the old cultivator looked at the youngest children among them, his expression becoming relaxed.

With my death, there would be fewer of you Tongye Continent cultivators living as stray dogs.

As for the younger generations to stand firm on Baopingzhou, it would be much easier.

A monk from a great temple arrived at the battlefield of Old Dragon City, sweeping his staff in the air, creating ripples.

The monk finally sat in mid-air, hands clasped together.

Bodhisattva hooks and locks, all bones resonating together.

His body was like a spiritual tower, glowing like fire.

An unknown Taoist master stepped onto a treasure boat, leisurely arriving as if he were on a scenic tour.

The old man unleashed a method of summoning soldiers like beans, scattering talismans like the common folk scattering paper money.

Hundreds of puppet figures, each standing several feet tall, appeared in the cloud seas.

In the vast expanse of land between Old Dragon City and Southern Mountain, the earth was remarkably flat.

Two regiments of Dali cavalry were stationed here, lined up like a tide, motionless.

They awaited the enemy.

An unarmored general, patrolling the front lines on horseback, held a sword and spear out of habit.

This high-ranking Dali inspector suddenly stopped his horse, facing south alone.

I, the Dali cavalry, shall charge from north to south, piercing through the continent!

The skill of killing, how could it be unknown? Not to mention the continent, the entire world was well aware!

Now, where the hooves stood, they would kill countless demons!

General Su Gaoshan raised his iron spear and pointed south, “Dare to come here? Grind them all to dust!”

---

The Emperor of Dali, Song He, remained in the northern capital.

After the court session, he allowed the officials in dragon robes to retreat for the time being and walked alone along the base of a tall red wall.

At the suggestion of the National Master, he had issued identical edicts to the vassal lords of the continent.

If Dali lost this grand battle, the continent would be annihilated, and everyone would have no country or home to speak of.

But if Dali won this battle, the three vassal states with the highest death toll could recover their nations, breaking free from the Dali Song family’s territory. Even if only one person remained, the Dali dynasty would actively assist in their recovery, and within a hundred years, they would surely become one of the strong nations of Baoping.

The Emperor of Dali personally swore an oath with the Five Mountains. Should he breach this covenant, both humans and gods would be enraged, and the Song family’s dynasty would be severed.

Before the edict was issued, there had been a question and answer session between monarch and subject, teacher and student.

Cui Zhan asked Song He.

The National Master questioned the Emperor.

The teacher asked the student.

“Your Majesty, if it comes to this, Dali may not even be able to maintain its position among the top ten dynasties in the future.”

“But if it comes to this, you, Song He, as a descendant of the Dali Song family, will undoubtedly become a renowned sage for millennia.”

“How to choose is up to you, Song He.”

Song He smiled and said, “The National Master underestimates the ambitions of this student. In the vast world of righteousness, how many emperors among the top ten dynasties could be worthy of being remembered for millennia in history?”

“Song He, you want your descendants to stand before their ancestors’ portraits and linger the longest beneath mine!”

The embroidered tiger nodded after hearing the answer.

Song He had a question he couldn’t help but ask, “What if I don’t agree, and I don’t let the National Master fulfill his wish?”

Cui Zhan laughed at the time, “Your Majesty, you know the answer well.”

The Emperor of Dali laughed heartily, “What an embroidered tiger.”

Finally, the Emperor glanced at the National Master, who had overstepped far too much.

Cui Zhan nodded.

The Emperor’s face bore a look of sorrow, and with the embroidered tiger by his side, it inevitably gave the feeling of being restrained.

But if Dali truly lost this calculating embroidered tiger, how could Song He not feel a bit anxious?

Cui Zhan slowly said, “I, along with Qi Jingchun, have left so many seeds of knowledge that are different from others for your Dali Dynasty. Even if Dali loses half its territory in the future, there will still be great opportunities for a resurgence. It’s just a pity that you may not witness it in your lifetime. In this matter, your fate is similar to that of the previous emperor. It is indeed a significant regret. Hence, having me as your National Master is a blessing for Dali, but it may not be a blessing for you two emperors.”

“A minor misfortune, but Dali and Song He have both been fortunate, having this opportunity and undertaking under the guidance of the National Master.”

The Emperor bowed respectfully to the old man, softly saying, “In that case, this student bids farewell to the National Master.”

At this moment, Song He let out a heavy breath, slammed his hand against the wall, and then firmly pressed against it, speaking in a deep voice, “Let’s hold up the sky together!”

A courtier in a dragon robe suddenly stepped forward, then quietly halted, whispering, “Your Majesty, someone’s coming from the north.”

Song He’s spirits lifted, and he quickly walked to the space between the two walls, looking up. Although he knew he wouldn’t see them, those people wouldn’t arrive so soon above Dali’s capital, but he couldn’t help but take a glance.

Now, the eastern Baopingzhou and northern Juluozhou were forming a continent under that grand plan!

The Fire Dragon True Man, along with Li Liu and the corpulent woman from Lushui Pit who had ascended, were still responsible for guarding this sea route.

One on the left, one on the right, safeguarding the “bridge” connecting the two continents.

A large group of sword cultivators from the northern Juluozhou were flying south toward Baopingzhou along that route.

The first sword immortal of the north, Bai Chang, the master of the Taihui Sword Sect, Huang Tong, and Li Cai from Floating Lake...

Besides the sword cultivators, there were also two high disciples of the Fire Dragon True Man, Yuan Lingdian from the Zhixuan lineage, and also from the Baiyun lineage.

A group of Daoist masters from the Da Yuan Dynasty’s Chongxuan Office, the master of the Pima Sect, Zhu Quan, as well as the bone sword cultivator, the female spirit Pu Rang from the Bone Swamp.

Jinguan City’s Gao Cheng had previously opened the restrictions of the world, allowing Pu Rang to summon her sword.

Now, Gao Cheng had already left Bone Swamp, and the Pima Sect cultivators had nothing to do, while Pu Rang, who had died in that ancient battlefield, chose to go to another battlefield, as if silently bidding farewell to that man who she could never be with. Since she had no hope of becoming a celestial couple with him, why should she burden him from becoming a human Buddha? 

Liking someone should not be like this.

As they traveled southward, whether they were sword cultivators or not, everyone lacked the spirit of heroism or the exuberance of youth.

Their hearts were calm.

It was just like doing something completely natural.

We, the sword cultivators from northern Juluozhou, quietly closed our doors. Regardless of how we fought and schemed against one another, using flying swords, cultivators, and martial artists, we often turned against our own kind.

But with the tide rising, any cultivator could be absent, but we could not afford to lose any from northern Juluozhou!

Those going south were even more heroic.

---

Liu Sixteen had just shared a drink with Mi Yu at the Dusty Pharmacy, but Mi Yu, who was supposed to go north, said he would return to the dilapidated mountain a little later.

So Liu Sixteen drank another pot of wine with this Sword Immortal.

That day, Lady Gui, the patron of the Fan family, suddenly arrived at the Dusty Pharmacy.

Liu Sixteen said, “I’m rather surprised you would do this.”

Both Liu Sixteen and the most authentic “Moon Palace Seed” Lady Gui could be considered remnants of ancient times. 

In later generations, people loved to talk about bizarre tales of immortals, saying there were ancient beings over the vast seas, who with just a finger could fill ten rooms.

In truth, for the two of them, it wasn’t anything extraordinary.

They, or rather “they,” had once looked down from the heavens at the earth, witnessing the rise of the human race, observing their ascent to the mountains, and finally their ascent to the heavens.

In the center of Baopingzhou. 

A great river, calm and quiet under the night sky. 

A small boat, with a child struggling to pole it.

But there was a lazy young man in white, lying at the bow of the boat, his white sleeves trailing in the water. 

The moonlight reflected off the water, making the white sleeves look even whiter. 

The young man closed his eyes and loudly sang, “Spring waters carry boats, boats carry people, the boat moves with the spring waters in the sky.”

Suddenly, the young man sat up, complaining bitterly, “Heaven doesn’t cherish the suffering of this singer.”

Cui Dongshan used his fingers to rub the corners of his eyes, trying to feign tears of sorrow.

But before he could squeeze out a tear, he saw two figures coming towards him; one from the Bone Swamp of northern Juluozhou and the other from even farther away.

At Jinguan City, Gao Cheng had once opened the barriers of heaven and earth, allowing Pu Rang to summon her sword.

Now that Gao Cheng had already left the Bone Swamp, the Pima Sect cultivators had nothing to do, while the spirit Pu Rang, who had died in that ancient battlefield, chose to go to another battlefield, silently bidding farewell to that man she could never be with. 

As they traveled southward, whether they were sword cultivators or not, everyone lacked the spirit of heroism or the exuberance of youth.

Their hearts were calm.

---

In the bustling and lively Qingfeng City, as the dusk fell, a shop was closing.

A man sat in the backyard of his shop on a rattan chair, holding a charcoal basket, quietly enjoying the snow.

He wore a long blue robe, cloth shoes, and white socks, looking somewhat shabby yet clean.

He resembled a fallen son of a once-prosperous family in a market.

And the ruler of the fox country was actually serving him wine like a maid.

Lord Xu, the city lord of Qingfeng, had recently left the city, so as the last remaining Nascent Soul in the city, she was free to act.

She remembered many years ago during a journey through the world, it was an autumn day when Zhu Lian covered his face and went to meet a so-called martial arts master, a legendary figure.

The young Zhu Lian, while wandering the rivers and lakes, passed through a small village where there was a large persimmon tree towering over many rooftops. At the highest point of the tree, many ripe persimmons hung unpicked, falling and colliding with the cooking smoke. 

Some daring children climbed onto the rooftops to poke the persimmons down, hoping for a meal and a scolding, which was worth it.

Young Zhu Lian hailed from a family of great renown, a lineage of scholars.

He waited for a bowl of warm wine for winter, his thoughts drifting far away, recalling memories tied to wine.

That journey had been Zhu Lian’s first real venture into the rivers and lakes. Although he had made some progress in martial arts, he still felt uncertain about his own skills. In his family and even in the capital, where everyone regarded him as a transcendent being, he had never had the opportunity to strike out.

Moreover, Zhu Lian had never seen martial arts as a proper career, casually taking a few precious martial arts manuals from his home just for fun.

So that journey was actually the first time Zhu Lian earnestly appreciated the landscapes of the world.

Then at a village tavern selling loose wine, a man, dressed in a wrinkled thick cotton coat, wearing cotton shoes padded with cotton, and a sickly cotton hat, stooped over the threshold of the tavern, trying to straighten up as he spoke, raising his voice to ask for two taels of warmed wine and a plate of fennel beans.

However, after pulling out a few copper coins to settle the bill, the man seemed to have run out of courage. Occasionally, when he chatted with people, the smile on his face seemed not too confident, and his shoulders were tense, always slanting, one high and one low.

At that time, Zhu Lian had asked the tavern owner for a pound of the locally brewed wine. That man probably felt embarrassed for having drunk two taels while others were having a pound, so he pointed at the children playing nearby and asked if they knew how many ways the character for “fennel” could be written.

The children ignored the man, only enjoying their own play.

Zhu Lian then changed his mind, ordering another bowl of wine and asking that scruffy man how many ways the character for “fennel” could be written.

That man wiped off the wine stains on the counter, and Zhu Lian ordered another bowl of two-tael wine, handing it to the man who might have read books or might not have.

In the end, after the man drank the two taels of wine he paid for and the two taels of free wine, he suddenly broke down, saying that on the road here, a dog had looked at him, as if it was talking to him, which was terrifying.

The owner and customers in the tavern all burst into laughter.

But Zhu Lian didn’t say anything nor did he laugh.

This was a trivial matter from the old hometown.

There were also some stories in the new hometown.

For instance, in the Dusty Pharmacy in Old Dragon City, there was a senior with a one-foot spear who had formed a bond with both Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafu.

In fact, Xun Yuan had considerable grievances with the dilapidated mountain, and they weren’t minor. However, before the mountain lord and Zhu Lian could discuss how to resolve their grievances, Xun Yuan had already died.

Thus, the world lost a lover of reading celestial texts and an even fonder admirer of watching the fleeting beauty of nature, who would splurge without hesitation.

The dilapidated mountain lost a grievance, and the human world lost much of its interest.

Zhu Lian leaned over to set the charcoal basket down at his feet, leaning back in the chair.

How many true friends are there in the world? Yet they are all slowly leaving.

The woman gently asked, “Yan Fang, are you lost in thought?”

She still preferred to call him Yan Fang; if there were outsiders in the shop, she would call him Shopkeeper Yan.

Zhu Lian, Yan Fang.

Zhu Lian didn’t turn his head, casually saying, “Once a person ages, they easily recall old friends and old affairs. Others’ trivial matters are my fond memories.”

The woman covered her mouth and laughed.

For Zhu Lian to say such a thing was truly a huge joke.

Unexpectedly, next, Zhu Lian suddenly said a few words that brought a somber atmosphere.

“There’s a lot of self-deception in the world, which seems tragic and laughable to outsiders.”

“But for those involved, it is a fortunate beauty and a necessity.”

“For example, you might feel that Qingfeng City isn’t a place to entrust your life, but you increasingly find that I’m far better than Xu Huan and that woman. Really, don’t do this. Rely on yourself, don’t depend on anyone, not even me, Zhu Lian, or my dilapidated mountain; you must not rely completely on anyone.”

That made her frown.

But Zhu Lian added, “All women in the world should not be like grass that bends in the wind. I have always believed that every woman has her own charm that is no less than a man’s.”

She was initially shocked, then suddenly laughed, nodding, “I know, I know, you always have the most profound principles.”

Zhu Lian turned to look at her, smiling, “I’m a mirror; if you don’t believe it, look at whether I have you in my eyes?”

She playfully rolled her eyes at him, not looking.

Zhu Lian bent down to pick up the charcoal basket, standing up and joking, “I see myself in your eyes, so you must be my mirror. Of course, I need to take you home.”

At first, she felt a twinge of fear, but then her gaze turned resolute as she asked, “Is it today?!”

Zhu Lian nodded, “I can’t openly strike out; there’s no need to deliberately cause a scene here.”

She hesitated for a moment and quietly asked, “Don’t blame me for being indecisive. This kind of commotion cannot be hidden, and if Lord Xu pursues after the fact? Are we truly fine?”

It was “we,” not just “me.”

She didn’t mean to say it that way, but her heart had a mind of its own, leading her to speak this way.

Zhu Lian smiled warmly and gently pinched her cheek before lifting the charcoal basket in his hand, “One stream of urine can ruin Lord Xu’s plans.”

She turned her head away, shooting him an annoyed glare.

Other men could say such things, but only you, Zhu Lian, could not.

Zhu Lian muttered to himself, “Taking you and the fox country back to our homeland, I must descend the mountain.”

She was increasingly worried, “Are you going south?”

Zhu Lian didn’t provide an answer.

She became even more anxious. If she had just gone to the dilapidated mountain and Zhu Lian went to the battlefield, how would she manage in that unfamiliar foreign place? What would happen to her fox country?

Zhu Lian handed the charcoal basket to her, “Warm your hands. Rest assured, my young master hasn’t returned to his homeland yet; I wouldn’t want to die early.”

She looked at him with a strange expression, “You call Chen Ping An young master?”

Zhu Lian gently patted her cheek, laughing, “How bold, little maid, truly outrageous!”

She was not only not angry but instead smiled charmingly.

She raised her hand, gently covering his hand.

In the night, few knew the elegance of the night traveler.

Among all the people in the world, Zhu Yi Lang.

In the heavens of the barbaric world, due to Dong Sangeng, a moon had forever vanished. 

Today, the entire world plunged into panic, for inexplicably, a second moon had also vanished.

At the Sword Qi Long Wall, a round-faced girl in a cotton coat “unexpectedly” landed on the heavily restricted city walls.

The Dragon Lord was also an exception; he did not obstruct her actions.

A young man in a bright red robe, with a saber at his side, was slowly walking through his stances, then finished his movements and approached her, clasping his hands to stand still, smiling as he asked, “Is that Liu Cai? You’ve kept me waiting a bit too long.”

The round-faced girl was astonished, but deep down, she sighed softly.

While it might not be the truth, this guy was truly impressive.

When faced with matters, always think of the worst.

Chen Ping An smiled brightly, “One of the ten, still a sword immortal, quite impressive. When asking for strikes, please go easy; I’m quite afraid of dying.”

Finally, someone came to the city walls for a visit, and he could chat a few words with him.

Feeling great, he even treated the beasts of the barbaric world as humans for the time being.

After all, you’ll die soon!

In this vast world, the wife is the greatest.

So aside from Ning Yao.

No matter who you are, if you challenge me, you will die!

The round-faced girl said, “I’m not Liu Cai. I did go to Tongye Continent to look for him, but I couldn’t find him.”

Chen Ping An squinted, a sincere expression on his face, tentatively saying, “Since you’ve been to the realm of righteousness, why don’t you pretend to be Liu Cai for a brief moment? Just a stick of incense will do.”

She couldn’t help but laugh, “You’re sure you can kill me in just a stick of incense? By the way, my name is She Yue.”

Chen Ping An nodded, “I have a good eye for people; She Yue isn’t Liu Cai but is still one of the ten.”

Not only did Chen Ping An not draw his narrow knife, but he even took it off and casually tossed it far away.

Instead, from both sleeves, two short knives slid down.

He slightly bent over, wearing a bright smile, holding the knives in both hands.

She Yue patted her cheek.

Suddenly, the two short knives spun rapidly, creating a dazzling display, and the atmosphere on both sides became extremely chaotic.

Like countless fine sword energies crisscrossing the heavens and the earth.

Finally, when the short knives were firmly grasped by that man, all anomalies disappeared, and his smile became increasingly radiant, yet his eyes grew more and more insane. Then that man spoke in the elegant tongue of the barbaric world, saying something she completely couldn’t understand, “I’ve made up my mind; from now on, I’ll travel the world under the name Cao Mo!”

Having never intended to strike first, She Yue once again patted her cheek. After putting her hands down, she said, “Then I’ll give it a try?”

Chen Ping An laughed heartily, “Give it a try!”

(End of Chapter)
 

 **Chapter 835: Chen Shiyi**

Chen Ping'an held his double knives firmly, not rushing to make a move.

Facing a "peer" who was among the top ten young talents, there was some strategy to consider in how to approach this fight. After all, the top ten were not ranked by any particular order. And he was currently in the eleventh position.

The true identity, background, and lineage of the round-faced girl before him remained shrouded in mystery, like a moon hidden behind clouds. Since she dared to show up here, she must have been confident in her ability to leave alive; otherwise, that old dog, the Dragon Monarch, wouldn’t have allowed her to act on impulse.

Therefore, it was crucial not to scare her off. He needed to make her feel at ease, allowing her to go all out against him.

Besides, being in the top ten, it would be unreasonable if she couldn’t take down someone ranked eleventh; it would sound bad if it got out.

Chen Ping'an slowly approached her, spinning his twin knives rapidly between his fingers and the backs of his hands. The intertwining blades flickered like fireflies, moving so quickly that their light seemed to wrap around and dance, ultimately resembling two adorable miniature moons resting in Chen Ping'an's hands.

Seeing that the young man wasn’t hastily attacking, She Yue patiently awaited his move. She was quite curious about how he would open the engagement—would it be an illusionary talisman, or perhaps a flying sword technique that would give the sword cultivator a hard time? Or was it merely the brute force of a martial artist at the peak of the mountain?

She Yue had heard many legendary tales about this last hidden official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, especially two accounts that she, who usually didn’t care much for external matters, had surprisingly remembered clearly. Within and beyond the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were stories of the distant A Liang and the hidden officials of the south and north.

As for Chen Ping'an's flamboyant movements, She Yue chose to ignore them. When it came to the art of "playing with the moon," no one could hold a candle to her. Even the major demon, the Lotus Temple Master, who had been a neighbor in years past, had only gained a slight advantage due to age.

Her gaze shifted left and right, and she still felt that this well-known young hidden official of the wild world was merely decent-looking, not better than Jiang Shangzhen. Of course, whether a man was handsome or not didn't matter; the same could be said for women.

Once, a neighbor in the heavens had said that if one met the right person, they would see the most beautiful scenery in each other's eyes, as if they were two distant lands, with the sun and moon far apart, yet their gazes remained unchanged throughout time.

Unfortunately, She Yue had no interest in love affairs. The idea of being deeply infatuated was something she couldn’t even begin to imagine.

Chen Ping'an continued to approach slowly, tentatively asking, a puzzled expression on his face, “Earlier, there was an unusual phenomenon in the heavens—a moon was missing, and I could feel it here. Could it have been captured by Miss She Yue? If that’s the case, how can we fight? I’m just a small being on the city walls, while you’re in the vast realm of the bright moon… Moreover, I’m only ranked eleventh, a world apart from the top ten. I’m quite aware of this.”

The round-faced girl didn’t mention the whereabouts of the missing moon. Instead, she replied, “If you don’t want to fight, that’s fine with me. I came here just to enjoy the scenery, yet you insisted on being aggressive and challenging me.”

It was no wonder she and Jiang Shangzhen from Tongyezhou were such good friends; both were quite shameless.

When a man decided to be shameless, age didn’t seem to matter at all.

The two were still about thirty paces apart, but in terms of their realms, they felt as if they were only a hair's breadth away.

Chen Ping'an stopped about twenty paces away, suddenly retracting his knives, holding their tips backward, as if trying to show goodwill. He smiled and asked, “Miss She Yue, as the guest, how do you propose we fight? Let’s agree on some rules first; I’ll defer to your judgment. Otherwise, we might end up injuring each other.”

She Yue feigned disinterest, glancing at his dual knives and stating, “Good knives, unmatched sharpness, yet deeply concealed. What are their names?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, smiling, “I found them by the roadside; they’re not worth mentioning. They can’t compare to Miss She Yue’s grand skills of encompassing the great moon and refining heavenly luck. It’s a pity that the Dragon Monarch was worried I wouldn’t focus on my training and isolated me from the world; I regret not being able to witness such extraordinary sights.”

She Yue replied, “Although you’ve been deliberately downplaying your abilities, you can’t hide your murderous intent when it arises. You shouldn’t have accidentally shaped your blade light into a moon. Of course, I suspect you did it on purpose. You, the hidden official, have likely documented all the details of the battles you’ve faced outside the city wall; I could read them if I wished. That Feiran loves to peruse such records while enjoying wine.”

Chen Ping'an paused again, speaking helplessly, “Is it truly the case that holding a weapon incites a murderous heart? It’s my fault for not cultivating my mind enough; I admire Miss She Yue’s keen insight. As for that Feiran, if he admires me so much, after our spar, please tell him he can simply take on the surname Chen.”

She Yue’s expression became slightly strange.

Chen Ping'an realized, “Has that shameless Feiran taken on the Chen surname as a pseudonym? He didn’t even inform me before visiting! To take without asking is the act of a thief, utterly disgraceful!”

It had been many years since he had spoken with anyone.

He felt nostalgic.

Thus, Chen Ping'an was more than willing to make an exception for her. 

Today’s fight would involve more conversation. The more, the merrier—every additional sentence could help him pass a lot of time.

The agonizing stagnation of time felt unbearable, and Chen Ping'an truly wished to avoid experiencing it a second time.

The short knives in his hands, narrow as daggers, were acquired from a valley battle in the North Ju Lu Continent, where he had been ambushed by a group of assassins from the Cutting Deer Mountain.

In a narrow encounter, following a dangerous skirmish, Chen Ping'an, who didn’t believe in his own luck, had let Sui Jingcheng help collect the spoils of war, during which she had found these twin knives. They were inscribed with the words “Morning Dew” and “Evening Glow.” In truth, not only did Chen Ping'an and Sui Jingcheng initially fail to recognize their value, thinking them ordinary, but even the female assassin from Cutting Deer Mountain, the previous owner of the knives, had not recognized their significance. It was only when he encountered his close friend Liu Jinglong, who had read countless books, that he learned of their true nature. Liu Jinglong not only taught him the methods of refinement according to the texts but also revealed the true identity of one of the knives, inscribed with “Hunting the Deer,” which was the famed “Caozi Dagger” recorded in history. That Caozi was the name Chen Ping'an planned to use as he traversed the world in the future.

In the future, whether he ventured into the wild world or returned to his homeland, against any cultivator below the fifth realm, Chen Ping'an would ensure they wouldn’t know how they died.

As for those who died, whether they could see his true appearance or know his real name would depend on his mood.

Of course, this was all contingent on whether he could leave the Sword Qi Great Wall.

“Caozi” Cao Mo was the first assassin recorded in the grand history.

And with that place of three defeats, it was ultimately regained by Cao Mo.

What a good omen!

It should be noted that atop the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping'an had indeed lost three matches.

He thought of it as a way for him to share a bit of glory with that senior Cao.

In short, Chen Ping'an promised he would never let the “Hunting the Deer” in his hands gather dust.

At this moment, with one of his Caozi daggers in hand, known in the historical records as “Hunting the Deer,” the remaining knife, since it wasn’t recorded in history, Chen Ping'an decided to name it “Cutting the Deer,” following the name of Cutting Deer Mountain.

First, hunt the deer, then cut the deer!

He had a talent for naming things.

She Yue asked, “So, are we fighting or not?”

In the past, when she was in Tongyezhou, facing Jiang Shangzhen, who was known for “slaying immortals with a single willow leaf,” she seemed utterly defenseless. Besides her temporary lack of strength and realm in comparison, the round-faced girl had never intended to engage with Jiang Shangzhen. To her, pursuing the Dao and fighting with others seemed meaningless, and a battle she was destined to lose only served to annoy her; if she could avoid it, she would.

Yet today, facing this “eleventh hidden official” among the young talents, She Yue felt a bit selfish.

During the relentless pursuit of Jiang Shangzhen across ten thousand miles, he had indeed failed to kill her. Before he left, he had benevolently shared his thoughts with her, touching upon the essence of her Dao. It felt as though it was meant to happen, as if she were destined to hear Jiang Shangzhen’s words when she arrived in Tongyezhou.

She Yue was not one for many words, but she was far from foolish. When Jiang Shangzhen spoke, at first, she didn’t take it seriously, but after hearing him, she felt a stirring in her Dao heart. Undoubtedly, it pointed toward something profound.

Jiang Shangzhen’s words were like a poem of immortals traveling through the vast world, akin to a fragmented verse of stepping into the void. 

To sail to the azure heavens, one must have the means to perfect the missing pieces; in the five lakes, She Yue sold wine at the edge of white clouds.

At the time, Jiang Shangzhen had said little more, but he had frequently mentioned the hidden official Chen Ping'an, appearing to jest, which had piqued She Yue’s interest. Otherwise, given her temperament, why would she be so unusually patient with this hidden official?

She would either have left early or engaged in battle and left swiftly afterward.

However, if She Yue were to discover the truth later, she might wish to smash that Jiang fellow with a round moon.

Because the opportunity for enlightenment lay with the hidden official, it was purely Jiang Shangzhen’s nonsense. He merely wanted to use Chen Ping'an’s identity as a “close friend and brother” alongside his role as a disciple of the Falling Ruins Mountain to play matchmaker for himself.

Thus, he deliberately linked these two “peers” who were worlds apart.

But what made Jiang Shangzhen most formidable was that the prophecy was indeed true; it involved a significant secret in Tongyezhou, known only to the old sect leader of the Yuguizong, Xun Yuan, and half of the ancestor of the Yuguizong, Du Mao.

Tongyezhou was said to have once had a heavenly phoenix tree.

With such a tall tree, naturally, there would be a moon hanging from the sparse branches.

The tree was close to the heavens, and the moon came to the mortal realm; the tree and moon were intertwined, half in the mortal world, half in the heavens.

She Yue’s choice to disembark in Tongyezhou, rather than heading to Fuyiao or Posuo, was a meticulous decision. After the Lotus Temple Master’s death, another figure emerged out of the blue. As for Zhou Mi asking She Yue to help find Liu Cai, that was merely a side matter.

But the problem lay in Jiang Shangzhen hinting at a connection between the Dao and Chen Ping'an was absolutely false; it was a complete fabrication.

When dealing with women, Jiang Shangzhen seemed to weave a web of truth and falsehood, leaving all women convinced of one truth.

So in reality, after distancing himself from She Yue, Jiang Shangzhen was laughing heartily. “My good brother, Zhou Fei, I can only help you this far. Consider it a chance for you to find a round-faced girl to chat with in a foreign land.”

As for whether She Yue would seize this opportunity and whether she would truly complete her Dao, Jiang Shangzhen scoffed. “What does that have to do with me?”

Even with my slender arms and legs, I’ve already done this much; those who are merely spectators should roll up their sleeves and join the fray!

Moreover, would a wild world like the Moon Mountain turn into a fruitless endeavor, dressing up the moon for someone else? Whether the round-faced girl would find fulfillment was uncertain.

After all, during Xun’s time, he had once speculated that this prophecy might have something to do with the world’s most favored Bai Ye.

Was She Yue looking for Bai Ye? 

Or was Zhou Mi bargaining with Bai Ye?

Jiang Shangzhen found the thought amusing.

Regardless, even if the young girl couldn’t attain her Dao, what did it matter to me? I, Jiang Shangzhen, am so generous that I have gifted you a friend, Brother Chen. Shouldn’t that be enough to satisfy you?

Chen Ping'an had no idea about the twists and turns here.

If She Yue had mentioned Jiang Shangzhen, even just a word or two, Chen Ping'an might have been able to guess at least something.

But unfortunately, the round-faced girl was reluctant to bring up that “sister-in-law” Jiang Shangzhen, as she found his words rather distasteful.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an, looking troubled, stopped ten steps away and asked again, “Can we not discuss the rules before we start? It’s our first meeting, and there’s no enmity between us. Lighter punches are meaningless, while heavier techniques could lead to injuries.”

She Yue curiously asked, “Do you always like to chatter before a fight?”

“I don’t enjoy it; I used to dislike it very much.” 

Chen Ping'an suppressed his smile, holding the knives with their tips pointed forward.

Regarding this matter, Chen Ping'an had once taught someone how to conduct themselves while risking his life against Ma Kuxuan in a foreign land.

The two wide sleeves of his bright red robe seemed to tie themselves into a knot, binding the cuffs. The young man slightly bent at the waist, his posture slightly hunched, and his gaze turned upward a bit. “But you all keep making me dislike it. What can I do?! Miss She Yue, why don’t you teach me how to act according to my own preferences?!”

She Yue looked at the young man’s expression and gaze, “Less nonsense. One incense stick’s time; just come to kill me.”

She Yue raised her wrist, her two fingers together, with moonlight condensing like a lamp. She gently waved, and the moonlight dispersed across the Sword Qi Great Wall, marking the time for both sides with a stick of incense. In an instant, the moonlight filled the city walls, gradually dimming at a speed both sides could clearly perceive, as if the moonlight were slowly departing from the mortal realm, undetected by mortals yet observable by immortals.

Chen Ping'an squinted his eyes, now standing upright again, “When a guest comes from afar with a request, the host cannot refuse.”

Even with She Yue’s good temper, she was somewhat annoyed with this person. Despite his efforts to conceal his great murderous intent and heavy malice, he still insisted on speaking so jovially, as if they were old friends catching up.

She coldly said, “With the intent to kill, yet trying to fool me into holding back? You, sir, are lacking in principles.”

Chen Ping'an’s demeanor shifted entirely, no longer displaying even a hint of anger. He nodded gently, his face filled with sincere understanding, carrying a hint of guilt as he spoke, “I come from a humble background, while you hail from the bright moon above. Miss She Yue is a transcendent being from books—what do we need to fuss about? Isn’t that bullying? That wouldn’t be nice; perhaps you should change your ways in the future.”

It turned out that being able to converse with anyone was indeed a delightful thing.

It was enough to bring tears of joy to the hidden official.

He remembered reading in a book about someone who joyfully drank alone while others wept in despair.

At that time, he felt the realm of sages was too high, and his vision too narrow, so he couldn’t understand why they cried. Back then, he thought that traveling far or reading more would help him understand.

Once he knew why the ancients cried, he realized that it was better not to know.

When the ancient travelers found themselves at dead ends, they could still turn back.

Thus, Chen Ping'an, holding the twin knives, imitated the girl’s habit of lightly slapping her cheek when she was about to act.

Whenever She Yue got angry, before making a move, she would habitually raise her hands and slap her cheeks hard.

After accompanying this guy in endless chatter for so long, only to find that the opportunity for enlightenment wasn’t with him, and still being subjected to his strange comments, it truly irritated her.

Now he dares to mimic me?!

After slapping her cheek hard, a clear radiance scattered from her face, transforming into countless beams of light, the moonlight she had refined flowing like water, disregarding the restrictions of the Sword Qi Great Wall and the realms of the Ji Zhi account. The delicate, fragmented moonlight spread throughout half of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The “She Yue” standing at the city wall was struck by the twin blades—one severing her neck, the other piercing her heart.

Of course, it was merely an illusion created by She Yue. It was meant to test Chen Ping'an’s speed of attack and the sharpness of his blades.

Her inherent divine ability allowed her to reveal her true body even to Jiang Shangzhen, a sword cultivator of the immortal realm, requiring him to summon his own flying sword to find her true form. Though this hidden official was allied with the Sword Qi Great Wall, he was still merely at the Jade Purity realm.

She Yue could dodge and evade, and she could also deliver her own “flying sword” like an immortal, summoning countless techniques./n/nIf Sha Yue wanted to learn magic, no matter how unique or closely-guarded the teachings were, as long as it was under the light of the moon and there wasn’t a significant difference in their realms, all she needed was to have "seen" it once, and she would grasp at least seventy to eighty percent of the essence within. 

This wasn't to say that Sha Yue looked down upon the renowned Hidden Official, known for his myriad of techniques. In the wild, untamed world, when it came to combat methods, she was undoubtedly the best among her peers. Thus, in the secret records of the Jiazi Bureau, this round-faced girl in a cotton robe earned the title of the "Treasure House of the World."

Talismans, flying swords, golden body avatars, mechanism puppets, the true forms of great demons, celestial armor, devastating weapons… whatever was in her heart could manifest, all materialized by her moonlight. She could even possess the physique of an ordinary warrior at the Mountain Peak realm if she wished.

Unfortunately, due to her current cultivation level, she was limited to the resilience of the ninth stage, and Sha Yue didn’t particularly enjoy close-quarters combat techniques. It was akin to moonlight lingering on the earth, while the moon itself hung high in the sky.

The first Sha Yue, who had received two knife strikes, was merely an illusion she had crafted with the intent of forming a physique suitable for the Wandering Realm. Thus, her demise was expected, resulting in her immediate death. The round-faced girl in the cotton robe shattered, her moonlit form vanishing without a trace.

Chen Ping'an, although he had followed another manifestation of Sha Yue, had already sensed an anomaly near the city walls before he drew his blades. A hand appeared, radiating an unusual light, revealing a flawless magical seal that emerged from thin air, commanding the five laws of thunder in the palm of his hand.

This spontaneous five-thunder technique was not meant to kill Sha Yue’s illusion; there was no need to mobilize such force against a warrior at the Wandering Realm. Instead, the thunder blazed brightly, illuminating dozens of feet around him, seeking clues for the dissipating moonlight. If the two were to clash, even the slightest collision could give Chen Ping'an a sliver of advantage, transforming that sliver into ten thousand opportunities for slaughter on the mountainside.

For every minuscule chance his opponent possessed, he would return it tenfold.

Treat others with sincerity and hospitality, wishing for mutual benefit.

Unfortunately, that girl, Sha Yue, was too cautious, leaving no openings.

And that was fine.

Otherwise, how could the so-called ten best young talents of the world not disappoint?

Why would they have any right to stand alongside her?!

Chen Ping'an, at the small world’s sky curtain, shattered a large mass of moonlight with his dual blades, then rode the wind to hover above the city walls.

Sha Yue’s form split into three, each one spaced far apart.

In addition to the two true flying swords belonging to him, the Bird in the Cage and the Moon in the Well, he also had two flying swords meant for Qi practitioners, the New Moon and Full Moon, along with two imitation swords from the Sword Immortal of the Hate Sword Mountain, the Thunder Cough and Pine Needle.

Chen Ping'an’s heart stirred, sending the Thunder Cough and Pine Needle darting toward the two girls.

He himself executed the technique of shrinking the earth to travel thousands of miles, appearing before one of the Sha Yues who faced him, striking a fighting pose.

The previous Wandering Realm physique had been too weak; now, she had switched to a Mountain Peak physique, seeking to test how heavy her fists were.

Did she think she was as fearsome as Xiao Qian when throwing punches?!

As Sha Yue struck first, even Chen Ping'an, who was meticulous in assessing his opponents, couldn’t help but think her technique was crude, her intent weak, and her foundation lacking.

Perhaps the only thing commendable about this warrior version of Sha Yue was her speed, reminiscent of the sensation from when that brooding man had once sparred with him.

Clad in bright red, sleeves swirling, wielding dual blades, she darted and danced, chasing her enemy while cleaving through the air.

However, this warrior version of Sha Yue, with her Mountain Peak physique and learned boxing techniques, could only retreat repeatedly, evading attack after attack.

Even though her speed was slightly superior, Chen Ping'an miraculously appeared at her escape points time and again, putting her in peril.

She intended to test the resilience of her opponent's physique, but with both sides asking questions, how could she succeed?

Though they were both at the Mountain Peak realm, the gap in pure martial prowess was still too great.

Just as his blade was about to pierce her shoulder, Chen Ping'an unexpectedly twisted his body, delivering a light elbow strike to her forehead.

Sha Yue slipped back for over ten feet, her moonlight-formed cloth shoes shattering into pieces. As she halted her retreat, she "put on" a new pair of shoes.

The young man, slightly leaning back, casually offered his back to the Mountain Peak warrior Sha Yue, smiling lazily as he asked, “Was it not fun at all?”

The warrior version of Sha Yue, expressionless, had transformed the round-faced girl in a cotton robe into one clad in a magnificent robe imbued with celestial energy. Over the robe, she wore a set of dazzling battle armor, its radiant glow shimmering with colors.

Though he couldn’t identify the robe, Chen Ping'an recognized the armor. His eyes widened in surprise as he curiously asked, “Miss Sha Yue, is that transforming armor you’re wearing called the ‘Rainbow Dew Armor’? Ah, indeed, the vast wilderness has a rich history that rivals others, and you hail from the Moon, a celestial being I can only envy. Have you, besides the Rainbow, also seen the ‘Cloud Sea’ and ‘Radiant Glow’ armors?”

His friend, Zhong Kui, well-read and knowledgeable, had once immediately recognized the origins of the armor worn by Wei Xian.

The Buddhist Kingdom, Flower Bud, Mountain Ghost, Water Fairy, Radiant Glow, Colorful Robe, Cloud Sea, Western Peak.

In total, there were seven of the earliest “ancestral” Rainbow Armors. Besides the one Chen Ping'an had acquired and lent to Wei Xian, according to Zhong Kui, it was said that only the Mountain Ghost and Colorful Robe remained, with records of their existence in the current world; the rest had long since vanished.

The warrior version of Sha Yue remained silent, raising her fist once more, beckoning the infuriating young man with a curl of her finger.

No matter how hard her fists were, and despite her dual blades being elusive, did she truly believe she could kill him?

Her gaze seemed to convey a message: if you can completely shatter this warrior physique, perhaps we could exchange a few words.

Chen Ping'an recalled the fortunate acquisition of the Western Peak Rainbow Armor, making it hard not to think of certain people and events.

Sometimes, one had to admit that the more one saw and knew, the more burdensome it became; it wasn't always a blessing.

Because it made acceptance easier.

Fortunately, Chen Ping'an had always embraced fate, so he could choose not to accept it at certain moments.

Otherwise, if one inadvertently connected joy and sorrow in the affairs of the world, it would be particularly difficult for those who were usually the most cautious to endure.

Since that girl, Sha Yue, was seeking a fight, he might as well show some sincerity.

As a pure warrior, he should be less concerned about the propriety of gender interactions; after all, that wasn't the mark of a true hero!

Chen Ping'an turned around, utilizing the top-tier techniques from his sleeve to store away the dual magical blades that felt like extensions of his very being.

In the matter of sparring, he sought it but could not attain it.

He wished she would throw out a thousand punches, with her pinnacle martial intent as a Mountain Peak warrior landing upon him.

However, even as Chen Ping'an suppressed his own Mountain Peak realm to its lowest point, the warrior Sha Yue showed no intention of striking first. It was clear she wanted either to land a blow on him or to take a hit while encased in her armor and the Rainbow Dew Armor.

If Chen Ping'an were to treat this lightly, Sha Yue wouldn’t mind, knowing she only had a short incense stick's time before she would leave the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Thus, Chen Ping'an had no choice but to let go of his reservations, feeling a bit guilty. Not only did he strike with more force, but he also accelerated slightly, first shattering the ambiguous Rainbow Armor, then the unknown robe, and finally, with a decisive blow, shattering the warrior Sha Yue's head.

All dissolved into moonlight.

Sha Yue realized that testing the young Hidden Official's ninth stage further was pointless. Her form dissipated in place, splitting from one into ten, scattering across half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, with two appearing at the cliff edge and the city walls.

No longer was there that amiable round-faced girl; instead, there were various forms, some with golden body avatars, some as sword-wielding immortals, and others as true demons.

Even though she was aligned with the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Ping'an still found it difficult to pinpoint the real Sha Yue among the myriad illusions. One was genuine, or they could all be false.

These uncertain existences all asked in unison, “Why don’t you employ those sword immortals that stepped out from the scrolls? Wouldn’t that save time and effort?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “A stick of incense’s worth of time is actually quite long. It’s just that I’m someone with nothing to do, so I cherish every moment.”

As he spoke, Chen Ping'an stepped on something, slowly ascending. Beneath his feet appeared a colossal imitation of the White Jade Capital, gradually revealing itself as if water had receded to reveal stones, until finally, the pinnacle of the White Jade Capital soared high, almost touching the sky.

The young Hidden Official, clad in the Daoist "Crimson Purple" heavenly attire, resembled a true immortal of the White Jade Capital, his methods transcending the heavens, allowing him to stroll leisurely.

He stepped atop the peak of the White Jade Capital, eventually reaching a particularly intricate eave.

Chen Ping'an reached out, grasping a sword immortal flag, lightly tapping the empty space beside him. Rings of ripples spread out, endlessly overlapping.

Sha Yue suddenly asked, “I'm not Liu Cai; you seem a bit... angry? Are you suspecting Liu Cai? Because I’m not Liu Cai, does that confirm some of your thoughts?”

Chen Ping'an maintained his usual demeanor, smiling casually as he replied, “How could that be? Miss Sha Yue, don’t be so suspicious. How could I guess the identity of someone who has allowed you to see all the moonlight across the world, someone who has made you wear out countless pairs of cotton shoes in search of them?”

Half the incense stick had passed.

Chen Ping'an suddenly focused his mind, plunging into a tranquil state as if sinking to the bottom of an ancient well. His spirit felt light, as if wandering freely, his thoughts drifting with the ripples, smiling as he said, “Miss Sha Yue, as a demonic cultivator, you should be cautious when naming yourself in the future. Otherwise, you might inadvertently leak the roots of your Dao. That’s a major taboo in the martial world, so do remember. ‘Sha Yue’ is too obvious. Why not learn from Fei Ran, whose name is elegant and sounds like a cultured scholar? After acknowledging your ancestry as Chen, it would be even better.”

The ten Sha Yues seemed to share a competitive spirit, morphing from ten to hundreds, then thousands, filling the city walls.

Among them, one Sha Yue revealed her true form, looking up at the towering structure, smiling as she said, “But I’ve already named myself; everyone knows it, so how can it be ‘in the future’? Besides, I don’t want to change my name.”

A gentle breeze blew down from the heights, rustling the young man’s garments and hair.

He smiled and answered, “In the next life.”

Sha Yue was then struck by the realization that he was the eleventh?!

The one standing at the highest point of the imitation White Jade Capital seemed to have seen through Sha Yue’s thoughts, saying, “If it weren’t for being here and taking advantage of some favorable timing and geography, I wouldn’t even rank as the eleventh.”

Sha Yue suddenly felt the urge to engage with him seriously, no longer merely testing the waters.

Chen Ping'an refrained from elaborating further, merely tugging at the corner of his mouth, a fleeting look of amusement that was perfectly visible to Sha Yue.

It seemed to say, I can't kill you, and you can’t kill me either, so let’s both take this seriously and give it another go.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 836: Two Strikes

Chen Ping'an stood atop the highest and most perilous point of the replica White Jade Capital, wielding a fully repaired sword immortal flag. 

In his own world, every detail came into focus, as if he were a common man closely examining an inscription carved into a cliff. 

The celestial maiden, She Yue, seemed infatuated with the seven-colored dew armor. 

On the city wall, the only “cultivator She Yue” to show her true form channeled the moonlight through her innate divine abilities, adorning herself once more with the extraordinary armor that resembled an ancient rainbow. She looked up at the young hidden official clad in what appeared to be a Daoist robe. 

The colors of her armor flowed like the ethereal ribbons of a “Wu family” celestial maiden from Buddhist temple murals. 

She Yue quietly awaited the dispersal of the sword Qi ripples, confronting her luminous moonlight at every turn, as if two armies were clashing, each with millions of troops ready for battle. 

Beneath her feet, the white jade replica of the White Jade Capital towered, akin to the “highest peak in the heavens.” This celestial treasure was familiar to She Yue, having originated from the adjacent moon of the Lotus Blossom Abbot. It was an ancient relic that the old demon Daoist gifted to a secluded disciple of the Lotus Blossom Mountain to curry favor. After Li Zhen's defeat and demise, it was picked up by Chen Ping'an, who had not yet assumed the role of a hidden official, evidently guided by a master, allowing him to refine it completely. 

Was it the Taoist sage who once guarded the sword Qi Great Wall’s sky? Yet, would it be appropriate for a Taoist to guide a Confucian disciple in refining an object shaped like a replica White Jade Capital? 

She Yue understood that the other party was still searching for her true form, and her mind wandered, making her realize why Mr. Zhou would say she was too lackadaisical. 

However, today, She Yue intended to take things more seriously, as she was indeed a bit angry. 

On the city wall, She Yue’s numerous moonlight avatars were bizarre and diverse. Sword immortals summoned flying swords, martial artists hurled punches toward the White Jade Capital, and great demons soared up, crashing into the White Jade Capital with their immense bodies. As they advanced, the sword Qi ripples from the sword immortal flag suddenly knotted in various places, forming a vast net woven from countless strands of sword Qi from the half-completed Great Wall of Sword Qi. It was evident that to shake the White Jade Capital, they would first need to break through the omnipresent, overwhelming sword Qi with their physical bodies, flying swords, martial techniques, or divine abilities. 

The momentum was fierce, and it was no mere trickery. Thus, She Yue alone launched an attack as if a great army had assembled to assault the White Jade Capital. 

As for the original form of "She Yue," she rode the wind, her seven-colored armor smashing through the sword Qi net, making her way toward Chen Ping'an’s vicinity. 

In the realm of “Jade Purity,” Chen Ping'an smiled casually, raising one hand to officially summon an ethereal and extraordinary five-thunder talisman. Instantly, it expanded to the size of a mountain peak, then suddenly descended, perfectly overlapping with the high point of the White Jade Capital. 

This put Chen Ping'an at the summit of the White Jade Capital while standing atop the talisman. 

The tall building, like a journey through the mortal realm, featured a scholar riding a white ox, hanging books from the ox's horns. 

All laws converged, and the flickering lightning intertwined, as if a heavenly tribulation were gathering in the sky. 

If this were not at the Sword Qi Great Wall, but rather in any other realm, perhaps these creatures beneath the Earth Immortals, specters, and entities of the mountains and rivers would collapse in fear upon seeing the White Jade Capital, the thunderous heavenly tribulation, and this godly figure in the sky, their hearts and minds shattered. 

Chen Ping'an, who resembled both the immortal of the White Jade Capital and a “godly being,” although his gaze was fixed solely on the colorful-armored “She Yue,” was already surveying the heavens and earth. 

Holding the sword immortal flag, Chen Ping'an stepped forward, firmly planting his foot on the talisman, left hand holding the flag, right hand pinched into a gesture, facing the ground as he lightly inscribed characters. 

Though it was a thunder law talisman, it could be regarded as the pinnacle of all laws in thunder, deserving of its reputation for creating myriad beauties. Once this talisman emerged, it hung high in the sky, and the scene manifested through the technique was far from limited to thunder and lightning. 

From the seal of the inscription, bolts of lightning burst forth like the combined might of sixteen heavenly thunder generals wielding whips, striking down to the mortal realm. 

Strands of golden lightning descended from all directions, rapidly plunging to the ground, turning sharply to finally strike the great demons that were crashing into the White Jade Capital, shattering the moonlight into dust, leaving no trace. 

The five-thunder talisman that Chen Ping'an had manifested from his palm was previously guided by the outer celestial demon Frostfall in the prison, and the tailor had assisted in relocating the five-thunder talisman to the “mountain peak” pattern on the palm of Chen Ping'an. 

The talisman consisted of a total of six faces, referred to by Frostfall as the “Six Full Talismans,” also known as the “Moon Full Talisman.” Aside from the top's heavenly inscription being incomplete, one face was blank, and the base featured the sixteen-character inscription in insect-bird script: 

“Gathering the five thunders, encompassing all laws. Severing the five leaks, the pivot of heaven and earth.” 

Thus, the sixteen bolts that resembled ancient divine “thunder whips” originated from these sixteen ancient inscriptions, with each insect-bird script character at the base of the talisman appearing as the core of the thunder department. 

The remaining four faces were inscribed with a total of thirty-six deities who had yet to be “awakened,” depicted with closed eyes. The significance of the number nine was immense, and thus the engravings portrayed figures of thunder lords, wind masters, rain teachers, cloud officials, and celestial maidens, all resonating with a profound ancient aura. 

The endless transformations of yin and yang, all within this talisman of mountains, all contained within the grasp of the holder. 

The characters that Chen Ping'an currently inscribed were meant to “unauthorized” engrave the heavenly inscription onto the talisman. 

The study room below was stocked with ancient inkstones from the world of heaven and earth. This five-thunder talisman, which fell into Chen Ping'an's hands due to a fortuitous encounter, was supposed to have dual inscriptions from heaven and earth. 

Chen Ping'an aimed to fill the gaps in the talisman, completing the last blank inscription with his own. 

The second-hand bookstore owner was not well-read but had a fair amount of experience in engraving seals. 

What if the moon waxes and wanes again? With a heart as bright as the moon, even if it wanes, it will return to fullness. The cycle of the Dao rotates between gain and loss. 

I have stood atop this city wall for many years; I have not complained daily about heaven and earth, nor have I neglected my sword refinement, talisman painting, or martial arts training. 

I even managed to compile three hundred thousand words. Even if that book of travelogues only contained this little content, I would refine it just the same, whether it be three million words or ten million—Chen Ping'an would refine it all! 

In the future, when the opportunity arises, I shall wander the world under the pseudonym Cao Mo. 

As for the path of talismans, I am also an adept in this craft. 

On the city wall, surrounding the replica White Jade Capital, great demons rampaged, shaking this magnificent structure that resonated with the Sword Qi Great Wall, allowing the thunder whips to strike down upon them with overwhelming force. The moonlight shattered and reformed tirelessly, as if they had suffered no damage at all, suggesting that even the slightest tremor of the White Jade Capital would disturb Chen Ping'an's soul and Dao heart. 

Moreover, a number of golden-bodied martial artists, She Yue, ascended the great towers and walls of the White Jade Capital with astonishing speed, moving like apes climbing cliffs. 

There were also golden-bodied manifestations of martial artists whose identities Chen Ping'an did not even know, towering at a hundred feet, wielding divine weapons, smashing relentlessly into the White Jade Capital. 

Chen Ping'an's heart stirred slightly, unable to help but frown. Did She Yue's backing seem excessive? She was not very old, yet had so many tricks up her sleeve. A girl like her, appearing foolish yet cunning, would surely have no friends wandering the rivers and lakes. 

You have your myriad techniques and divine powers, while I possess my little expertise. 

Chen Ping'an drove the sword immortal flag forcefully into the ground, racing like the wind and lightning, falling from the White Jade Capital to the mortal realm. Both the flag and the talisman were refined objects, so naturally, there was no hindrance. The flag pierced through and vanished in an instant. 

It landed in a replica great city within the White Jade Capital. 

After the sword immortal flag was driven into the central ground of the city, the great banner stood tall, and troops assembled. 

The sword immortals contained within the flag subsequently emerged one by one, shooting out like meteors, some flying with swords and others wielding them, tasked with eliminating the martial artists She Yue that clung to the White Jade Capital. 

This display of sword immortals was, indeed, more impressive than when Li Zhen first summoned them. 

Chen Ping'an's mind was primarily focused on this matter of completing the inscription. 

He had already inscribed four characters on the talisman as the heavenly inscription. 

However, he had never truly poured his heart into it or executed the foundational method above “Dan Shu Zhen Ji.” 

Thus, the act of writing was the first complete manifestation of the “Five Thunder Talismans.” 

As Chen Ping'an inscribed the characters, his thoughts directed the talisman, and the fragments of the inscription scattered like shimmering snowflakes until they finally formed four characters: “Water Dew Stone Emerges.” 

The characters emerged, initially appearing small, only the size of a palm, so insignificant compared to the talisman’s mountain-sized surface that they could be overlooked. Chen Ping'an looked down at the four characters. The first strange thing about this inscription was that after suffering hardships and losses in the past, he decided to write the characters backward this time. Coupled with the borrowed cultivation of the Jade Purity realm, this allowed the inscription to be completed effortlessly, almost seamlessly. 

Upon seeing those four characters, Chen Ping'an's eyes crinkled into a smile of genuine delight. 

It felt as if the Dao was lofty, distant from certain high and mighty beings, but today, since he could write those four characters, it proved that continuing on this path for another ten, hundred, or thousand years would only bring him closer to those heights than the youthful swordsman who once drifted on a single leaf boat. He was getting closer every day. One day, he would wander the world on a sword, visiting the realm of heaven and earth, standing at the same height as the summit of the White Jade Capital. 

One day, he would soar away on a sword, visiting the azure realm, equal to the pinnacle of the White Jade Capital. 

The colorful She Yue, who had originally flown toward Chen Ping'an and the Five Thunder Talisman, suddenly changed her mind, shrinking the mountains and rivers to take a shot at the sword immortal flag at the heart of the formation. 

Having completed the inscription, Chen Ping'an smiled and, mimicking She Yue, let his mind wander. 

Choosing to align with the Dao, although losing his yin and yang spirits and heavily damaging the Dao, he did not feel much disappointment about it. 

I am still me. 

Chen Ping'an remains Chen Ping'an. 

In my heart, I dwell for a long time, always residing in my hometown. 

The cultivator She Yue, clad in armor akin to the essence of military ancestors, caught Chen Ping'an’s attention, increasing his unexpected joy. Zhong Kui had once mentioned that the seven pieces of dew armor, including those in the Western Peaks, were most enigmatic because they possessed certain innate abilities similar to those of sword cultivators. 

As She Yue neared the city where the sword immortal flag stood, seven celestial maidens materialized from seven ribbons, ultimately forming a rainbow that hung in the air, starting from where She Yue rode the wind and landing on the sword immortal flag above. As it struck down, the rainbow light collided with the flag, dazzlingly shining, sending sparks flying, yet the momentum flowed like a river into the sea, endlessly surging. The aura around the flag stirred violently, as if great waves were crashing against rocks, with spiritual and sword energy merging, causing the sword immortal flag to begin to tremble. 

After following She Yue's lead, another “Chen Ping'an” stood atop the flag, one hand resting behind him while the other formed a gesture in front, smiling as he gazed through the rainbow at the woman approaching on the wind, saying, “This little White Jade Capital of mine, with five cities and twelve towers, has only this one door closed. Miss She Yue, please go elsewhere to enjoy the scenery.” 

It was unexpectedly a “Chen Ping'an” clad in a blue Daoist robe. 

His face appeared slightly older than the real Chen Ping'an. 

This scene, these words, were likely not received warmly by all the Daoist immortals in the azure realm. 

She Yue was unaware of the true identity of that “middle-aged Daoist,” but it didn't matter to her. 

As for overstepping one’s bounds, she had done it plenty. 

For example, as she reached the top of the rainbow arc, she transformed into the likeness of the Lotus Blossom Abbot, reaching out to press down. 

Above the grand city, the cloud sea condensed into a pristine white hand, within the palm were lotus leaves, radiant in moonlight, intertwining with green lotus under the moon's glow, and then in a flash, the palm's lotus pool blossomed with countless snow-white lotus flowers. 

The middle-aged Daoist Chen Ping'an glanced at the descending hand and the blooming lotus pool, smiling, “The Dao is vast, yet it is not defined by the magnitude of forms. Smallness remains small.” 

The Daoist stood with one hand behind him, performing a gesture, flicking his fingers. 

A golden light slowly ascended. 

The might of the thunder crashing down toward the lotus pool was overwhelming, and with every flower that bloomed, a pillar of pure white light descended. 

That golden light from the middle-aged Daoist, swaying like a bird's wings in a storm, first welcomed the deluge of snow-white rain. 

Daoist Chen Ping'an smiled, “Quickly, as per the command, go!” 

The golden light abruptly vanished, appearing on the back of that palm facing downward. 

A dragonfly had already perched on it. 

Be it the clash of rainbow light and the sword immortal flag or the oppressive might of that great hand, the emergence of this golden light bore no signs of earthly phenomena; logically, it wouldn’t make a difference. 

Yet, when the golden light lingered on the back of the hand, it caused the torrential white rain to reverse course, causing flowers to bloom and then retract, the palm descending and then retracting. 

Time flowed backward. 

It resembled a contest of Daoist techniques between the middle-aged Daoist and the Lotus Blossom Abbot. 

She Yue shook her wrist, recalling the rudimentary techniques she had observed, and the great hand dissipated. 

She still focused her thoughts on shaking the sword immortal flag, proving that not just martial artists but cultivators could also overpower myriad opponents through sheer strength. 

This cultivator, She Yue, stopped, glancing around. 

How precarious it was, towering high, five cities and twelve towers. 

A wave of thunder and lightning surged, enveloping the mighty might of the heavenly Dao, crashing down upon the earth ruled by the White Jade Capital, shattering the moonlight of the great demons again and again. 

However, the sword immortal flag was suppressed by the rainbow light, and the number of sword immortals that had emerged earlier was too few, allowing the climbing martial artists of She Yue to advance with their sword light, cutting through them endlessly, while the sword immortals could not completely sever them. The martial artists’ ascent toward heaven had already progressed significantly. 

Then, She Yue sensed something unusual. 

It was the first time she had this feeling. 

That Chen Ping'an had finally begun to use his ultimate techniques! 

If She Yue had not guessed wrong, he was using one of his innate items! 

Within the White Jade Capital, five tall martial artists resembling Chen Ping'an appeared, either wearing straw sandals and carrying a sabre, or sheathed swords on their backs, or with wine flasks hanging from their waists, or adorned with jade hairpins, or dressed as scholarly figures in blue robes. 

They simultaneously emerged from various heights of the White Jade Capital, each wearing one of the five-colored outfits. 

They swiftly dispatched the She Yue martial artists who lacked sufficient cultivation. 

“Too slow! Your strikes are too slow!” 

“Like paper!” 

“When martial artists question each other, strikes must land on the enemy. Don’t hold back!” 

The five martial artists resembling Chen Ping'an threw unceasing punches, shattering the bodies of the She Yue martial artists, twisting their heads off, or delivering straight hand chops that cleaved She Yue in two. 

What a pity for the compassionate and protective second-hand bookstore owner. 

Another gentle voice fell upon She Yue’s heart like a whisper from the heavens. 

“Miss She Yue, you have lived next to the Lotus Blossom Abbot for a long time, yet I have never exchanged a word with that Taoist sage of the sky. Why is it that your Daoist techniques seem so light, so easily broken?” 

“So, you see, seeking a teacher in scripture is not as good as finding a wise mentor. Why don’t you and I become disciples together? I have always set a high bar for accepting students. As for my teachings, they are quite commendable.” 

“Your techniques are merely a reflection of the vast moon's essence, treating the main body as the host and dividing it for guests. The fundamental Dao is to return to unity; it would be better if Miss She Yue were sincere, bringing out your true divine abilities as a visiting gift?” 

She Yue found this person quite bothersome. While he had considerable skills, he spoke far too much nonsense. 

She had never found anyone so irksome. 

Perhaps even two Jiang Shangzhen pursuing her for miles couldn’t compare to how annoying this Chen Ping'an was. 

Standing at the pinnacle, Chen Ping'an suddenly stepped on the last characters of the heavenly inscription inscribed earlier, which belonged to the initial part of the talisman. 

The characters written earlier were “Land,” “Sink,” “Decree,” and “Order.” 

Thus, the complete talisman was “Land Sink Decree.” 

So, when Chen Ping'an stepped heavily on the characters “Land Sink,” with a wave of his hand, he laughed loudly, “Go!” 

The characters Land and Sink moved to the upper left and lower right corners of the talisman, while the characters Decree and Order followed to the remaining corners. 

A six-faced five-thunder talisman was finally completed without any gaps. 

She Yue’s heart trembled slightly, sensing something was wrong. 

That five-thunder talisman, akin to the heavenly thunder department opening its doors, radiated light as it rapidly descended, aligning with the city wall and the heavenly Dao. 

This caused nearly half of She Yue’s illusions to find themselves within the realm of the “Land Sink Decree” in an instant. 

Standing at the top of the rainbow, the cultivator She Yue realized that only now did Chen Ping'an employ the fundamental techniques of the Sword Qi Great Wall to separate heaven and earth. 

At the same time, he summoned those two yet-unknown but evidently powerful innate flying swords. 

In the three realms of heaven and earth, half of She Yue was restrained. 

She Yue sighed softly, clearly realizing that this bothersome person had even more troublesome techniques. 

Regarding the heavenly restrictions of the Sword Qi Great Wall and the young hidden official’s innate flying swords, she was already aware and had prepared for the worst. 

It was just that she didn’t expect that this talisman, which could be used to enhance offensive power, would be transformed into a cage by Chen Ping'an with just a few strokes. 

One of the martial artists She Yue had just begun to attach to the White Jade Capital, rather than the cultivator She Yue clad in seven-colored armor, had the responsibility of gathering all moonlight, transforming back into a young woman with a round face in cotton clothing. 

She had already entered the small realm of the flying sword cage. 

As the talisman hit the ground, the thunder light vanished, and the world turned dim. 

It was as if in the chaotic void before the heavens and earth had opened. 

Even the towering White Jade Capital, the sword immortal flag, the middle-aged Daoist, and the five martial artists resembling Chen Ping'an all vanished without a trace. 

The young man clad in a crimson Daoist robe, holding a narrow blade, gently tapped his shoulder, slowly descending from the sky to the city wall, his smile radiant. “Even if I cannot completely vanquish Miss She Yue, I must at least keep a presence of her atop the city.” 

The young hidden official spoke polite words. 

Yet within this small realm of the cage filled with dense sword energy, apart from the path Chen Ping'an had taken, the flying swords dissipated on their own, making way for the crimson-robed figure, while all around the realm, flying swords gathered densely, forming circles and layers, their tips aimed straight at She Yue. 

Within ten feet around She Yue, the moonlight flowed like water, blocking those flying swords from entering. 

She Yue asked in confusion, “You altered the purpose of that five-thunder talisman without permission? Do you not care that this will diminish its potential as an immortal weapon, robbing it of the chance to become a talisman of a sect?” 

Chen Ping'an blinked, seemingly at a loss for words, as if to say, “Miss She Yue, your question is too overwhelming and difficult to answer.” 

She Yue curiously asked, “Isn’t that so?” 

Chen Ping'an stopped tapping the blade, resting the narrow knife at his waist, complaining, “Miss She Yue, you and I have a connection. I cannot allow you to belittle yourself. Even half of She Yue, or a small portion, should still be worth a sect’s talisman.” 

She Yue felt a little guilty and replied, “It’s just that your talisman techniques are too strange; I can’t predict how a single talisman could be so enigmatic.” 

Chen Ping'an suddenly posed an even stranger question, “Can one’s guilt lead to death?” 

Here we go again! 

She Yue raised both hands and slapped her cheeks heavily. 

Without Chen Qingdu stationed at half the Sword Qi Great Wall, no matter how strange the techniques of the Jade Purity realm Chen Ping'an were, how could they possibly stop a moon’s far journey? 

Chen Ping'an hung the narrow knife at his waist, suppressing his smile, hovering in midair, left hand’s fingers brought together, gently pressing against the void. 

Finally, a flickering light appeared in the air. 

Chen Ping'an’s fingers slowly swept from right to left. 

His eyes squinted, fixated on that speck of light, which transformed into a bright glow and gradually into a sword. 

In his small personal realm, a golden figure gently grasped the sword hilt, riding a fire dragon, heading toward Chen Ping'an’s heart lake, looking up at the sky where a moon hung. 

Behind Chen Ping'an stood a towering golden deity, his golden-body manifestation, yet clad in a Daoist robe, appearing middle-aged. 

In the realms of heaven and earth, the four characters converged into one place. 

The boy with the jade hairpin stood atop the characters, confidently smiling, almost smug, exuding the righteous spirit of a scholar. 

The boy in straw sandals stood on the characters “Land” and “Sink,” wearing a jade hairpin, his waist adorned with a water talisman. 

Initially, utilizing the Dao of the aligned realms, he thought alone, murmuring to himself, and wandered alone. 

With a golden elixir attained at the mountain peak, he would ultimately be recognized as one of those young swordsmen in the eyes of the gods atop the mountains. 

He would also master a fist technique, “Mountain Shaking Blueprint,” a talisman technique, “True Records of Dan Writing,” and a straightforward book titled “Sword Technique Canon,” all committed to memory. 

There remained a threshold for establishing a residence, yet no major talismans had yet been set aside. 

He still had a path back to his hometown. 

As the setting sun slowly departed, flowers bloomed along the path home. 

The moonlight around She Yue grew increasingly resplendent, the moon's essence growing denser. 

Layers of flying sword formations, formed from the innate divine abilities of the well at the bottom of the well, shattered instantly after being coated with a layer of moonlight, enveloping She Yue in moonlight, growing larger as a petite moon before ascending into a great moon. 

Yet, She Yue suddenly furrowed her brow, as countless flying swords were broken, but mysteriously, while the opponent’s flying swords dissipated, the true “only” flying sword seemed to silently refine itself through this innate moonlight! 

She Yue promptly halted her thoughts, abandoning the idea of using moonlight to forcefully break the formation and leave. 

Even though Chen Ping'an was now a sword cultivator of the Jade Purity realm, how much stronger could a single sword be? In reality, these myriad flying swords pointed directly at the true essence of “She Yue”? 

She began to gather the moonlight, condensing it increasingly thickly around her. 

Shall I give it a try? Let’s see! 

Chen Ping'an suddenly grasped the sword hilt, holding it horizontally in front of him. 

The golden deity behind him mirrored his actions, moving in perfect unison. 

She Yue, do you truly believe I do not know where you are hiding? 

I regard you as a beast of the wild realm. 

You should not regard me as a mere human. 

Come before me, and let us be enemies. Be cautious. 

One sword to sever the moon in my heart. 

Please reveal yourself. 

Another sword to cleave your true form. 

Please die. 

I have a sword to question, let heaven and earth answer, starting from the bright moon. 

That She Yue, who had plucked the moon from the sky to return to the mortal realm, ran headlong toward the opposite city wall, displeasing Li Zhen. Now, she could not fight that girl. The key was that when it came to origins and backgrounds, the other party was not lacking. 

Li Zhen could only exchange lives with She Yue at her peak, but now, her round face was less charming, her demeanor indifferent, her expression one that conveyed “don’t bother me,” which had once made Li Zhen envious to the point of jealousy. 

Li Zhen flew to the edge of the cliff, near a gray-robed figure, complaining endlessly, “Why didn’t you stop She Yue? Isn’t it impressive to have the heavens on your side? Can plucking a moon from the sky allow one to break the rules of the heavenly cycle? Let our hidden official capture her for a chat, wouldn’t that ruin all our hard work in an instant?” 

Now, on this half city wall where Li Zhen and the Dragon Lord stood, the hundred sword immortals of the Lotus Blossom Mountain had almost all rushed to the world of righteousness. Yet here Li Zhen lingered, as the direct successor of the Lotus Blossom Mountain's great ancestor, truly losing face for the sect. Even one of Li Zhen’s senior brothers passed by the Sword Qi Great Wall without greeting her, directly flying over the city wall. 

The Dragon Lord, gathering countless strands of sword Qi, formed a vague shape. The old man raised his sleeve, pointing at the last remaining bright moon in the sky, saying, “Isn’t there one left? If you have the ability to pluck it, I’ll let you wander over to the opposite city wall. Do as you please.” 

The hundred sword immortals of the Lotus Blossom Mountain were indeed the proud sons of the heavens in the wild realm, but above them was still a small handful of hidden figures, not very old yet with extraordinary status, unrecorded in the heavenly cycle. 

Aside from that round-faced girl who had been bothering Li Zhen, the mistress of that bright moon was actually also Fei Ran, Yu Si, Tan, and Dou Kou. 

Li Zhen sighed, “Dragon Lord, oh Dragon Lord, our friendship spans thousands of years, and we should cherish it more. Not only do you not protect my path, but you also say things that hurt feelings. Can this jar of old wine withstand your few hearty swigs? Always leave a line for others, there’s no absolute genius.” 

Plucking the bright moon down to the mortal realm. 

In the past, the Lotus Blossom Abbot could manage to refine half of a moon’s essence, but due to the presence of the Lotus Blossom Mountain, they didn’t dare proceed. Of course, doing so would also be meaningless. The moon not in the sky, exchanging earthly advantages for heavenly timing, was still a losing deal, detrimental to the practice of the Dao. 

The world of righteousness has many blessed lands, surpassing several realms. The Lotus Blossom Abbot, full of ambition, tried to unify the moons from various places, and when that happened, the old demon Daoist, along with some heavenly timing, would become the embodiment of the “Dao,” not merely a divine being, but surpassing one. 

It is said that before the great war, Zhou Mi once went to the heavens to discuss the Dao with the Lotus Blossom Abbot. Zhou Mi laughed amidst the moonlight, saying, “Why must we lose to the past this year? Why must contemporary people lose to ancient ones?” 

It’s a pity that flamboyance is often swept away by the wind and rain. The unfortunate Lotus Blossom Abbot even failed to catch a glimpse of the bright moon of the world of righteousness. It cannot be said that the Lotus Blossom Abbot was ambitious yet incompetent; it was simply that Dong San’s sword strikes were too domineering. 

Dong's bold act was not only in slaying the Lotus Blossom Abbot, a demon seated on a throne but also in completely ruining a portion of the heavenly timing and fortune of the wild realm. 

It was like taking a grain of rice and turning it into a pile of snowflakes; even if all the snowflakes landed in the pockets of the Lotus Blossom Mountain, the price difference was indeed a genuine loss for the wild realm. 

The Lotus Blossom Mountain would need to expend a considerable amount of resources to reconstruct a complete moon and hang it back in the sky. 

Though the Dragon Lord allowed that round-faced girl to land on the opposite city wall, he had been keeping an eye on the situation there. If She Yue made any move beyond the bounds, he wouldn’t hesitate to strike down mercilessly. 

Among the young generation, one of the top ten in the realm, destined for greatness, was indeed extraordinary, but in the eyes of an ancient sword immortal like the Dragon Lord, the young successors were merely reflections of his former self, nothing more. 

Compared to the lackadaisical Li Zhen, who was distracted by swordplay, She Yue's realm was sufficient, and with her unique divine abilities, she could break through numerous restrictions as if entering a no-man's land to meet the young hidden official. 

One had just returned from the other’s hometown, while the other enjoyed being a watchdog for someone else's house. 

Two young individuals of similar ages, hailing from different hometowns, fortuitously found themselves among the young ten. 

Li Zhen inquired, “Are they chatting or fighting?” 

The Dragon Lord replied, “A lone man and a lone woman, kindling a fire, do you believe it?” 

Li Zhen grinned, “Hurry and lift the restrictions, let me have a look. Seeing is believing. If they really ignite the thunder and fire, I’ll paint a divine scroll and ask someone to deliver it to Ning Yao. Who knows, perhaps Chen Ping'an will not be slain by Liu Cha but will be cut down by Ning Yao first. Wouldn’t that be splendid? When Ning Yao strikes at him, the hidden official certainly wouldn’t dare fart, only obediently stretching out his neck. That’s what I admire most about the hidden official.” 

The Dragon Lord cast a glance at this increasingly unfamiliar “observer,” shaking his head, “With this reunion, I admit you’re right— you are indeed more pitiful than Chen Ping'an. You are no longer an observer. At least Chen Ping'an stays here as a watchdog; no one finds it ridiculous. Perhaps even Fei Ran and the likes would respect him a bit.” 

The Dragon Lord gazed skyward. 

In the past, the three of them practiced swordsmanship together, climbed mountains, and questioned the sword of the heavens. 

In the end, the Dao diverged at that high mountain in the wild realm. 

He, the Dragon Lord, didn’t die at the Lotus Blossom Mountain but rather lost his heart at the moment when Chen Qingdu decided to visit the Lotus Blossom Mountain. 

Although he still willingly wielded his sword toward the Lotus Blossom Mountain, it was merely to provide an explanation to all his fellow practitioners who had become prisoners. 

Chen Qingdu had died once during the battle at the Lotus Blossom Mountain and ultimately died again here. 

So what about this observer? Having also perished once at the Lotus Blossom Mountain, and afterwards, lost to Chen Ping'an outside the city wall, the last trace of the Dao heart and the observer’s spirit within Li Zhen had likely vanished completely. 

The Dragon Lord rarely asked the same question twice, but today he made an exception for She Yue and another for Li Zhen, “In your final battle with Chen Ping'an, relying on the innate abilities of that flying sword, what exactly did you see?” 

Li Zhen laughed, “One is not an observer, and one doesn’t resemble the Dragon Lord. How dare you pity me.” 

The Dragon Lord switched to another question, “Did the one from the Lotus Blossom Mountain, like you, see that outcome?” 

Li Zhen pondered, “I wonder if my master knows about it. Because I don’t truly know anything.” 

The Dragon Lord ceased speaking. 

This Li Zhen was truly troublesome. 

Let’s just assume she would be sent off by the observer one last time. 

Li Zhen was either completely oblivious to the Dragon Lord’s intentions or knew and simply didn’t care, but she continued to plead, “Dragon Lord, please lift the restrictions. Practicing swordsmanship is so dull.” 

Unexpectedly, the Dragon Lord did indeed lift the restrictions of the heavenly cycle. 

Li Zhen exclaimed, “Oh no! The White Jade Capital is quite impressive; the hidden official seems to harbor quite a bit of resentment toward the azure realm. This Jade Purity realm of techniques and divine powers is indeed remarkable; I certainly can’t provoke it.” 

“Look, the hidden official is starting to stir the hearts of others. If it had been Sister Liu Bai, she’d have been in serious trouble.” 

“Dragon Lord, you’re of high rank and wide experience. Do you know where the true form of She Yue is? Can the hidden official’s keen nose catch a whiff?” 

Listening to Li Zhen’s incessant chatter, the Dragon Lord couldn’t help but recall some old matters he preferred not to think about. 

Chen Qingdu’s innate flying sword, Floating Duckweed, had long shattered at the Lotus Blossom Mountain. 

Thus, later generations came to have the saying that “the wind rises at the end of the green duckweed” and “a single floating duckweed returns to the ocean.” 

The Dragon Lord’s innate flying sword, the Immortal Tomb of the Great Ruins. 

The observer’s innate flying sword, the River of Time. 

Hence, within an ancient history that spanned thousands of years, the front page of the old history recorded “Sword Cultivator Observer,” whose way was the most arduous, targeted the most by those ancient deities. 

Friends Chen Qingdu and the Dragon Lord had been the longest guardians of the observer, merely for the longest time. 

Because the sword cultivators who guarded the Dao the most were those who had perished in the dust of history. 

There had once been several sword cultivators of incredibly high achievement, their sword techniques splendid and their sword intent vigorous, manifesting sword scenes of grandeur that could even stir the long-dead heart of the Dragon Lord millions of years later. 

It is hard for future generations to imagine that Chen Qingdu’s talent, back when he first started practicing swordplay, was not the best amid a tumultuous rise like comets falling. 

In fact, it could be said to be ordinary. 

Only due to fortunate circumstances did Chen Qingdu manage to seize the opportunity and hold on tightly to it, gripping that chance as if it were a sword. 

Yet, with Chen Qingdu’s stubborn nature, for thousands of years, he likely would not wish to confess this matter to anyone. 

The tides of time have changed, and the world has grown forgetful. 

Li Zhen stood on tiptoe, gazing toward the battlefield in the distance, exclaiming, “These two are truly fierce fighters, with all kinds of techniques; it’s dazzling!” 

An endless array of techniques and chaotic methods clashed on the battlefield. 

Li Zhen suddenly asked, “Chen Ping'an seems to have utilized his Jade Purity cultivation from the very start, unlike our hidden official’s usual style. This battle, could it end up being thunderous yet with little rain?” 

The thunder roaring was indeed quite significant. 

Suspended high above the White Jade Capital, that five-thunder talisman, inscribed with sixteen characters, each containing the true meanings of the Dao, was held by divine beings wielding thunder, fiercely striking down upon the earth. 

This left Li Zhen feeling somewhat dazed, as if the sword cultivator observer had returned to the ancient battlefield. 

Li Zhen shook her head, dispelling those meaningless thoughts. 

With a face full of regret, Li Zhen lamented, “What a pity it isn’t Liu Cai. If it were Liu Cai, with those two innate flying swords, if paired with a certain treasure borrowed from the Lotus Blossom Mountain, no matter how cautious our hidden official was, he would still end up losing completely.” 

The Dragon Lord mocked, “Hoping for others to come to your aid is no longer an observer. Do you no longer wish to be a sword cultivator?” 

Li Zhen sighed, “Dragon Lord, what’s wrong with you? Why are you always so sarcastic when speaking with me? Why don’t you challenge the hidden official to an arm-wrestling match?” 

The Dragon Lord continued focusing on the battlefield, casually replying, “No use arguing with him. Why humiliate myself?” 

Li Zhen had no retort. 

On the opposite city wall, the figures of the two suddenly vanished. 

Li Zhen laughed heartily, “The hidden official has finally revealed his killer move! Miss She Yue has truly overstepped; once caught, escaping will be difficult.” 

The Dragon Lord remarked, “That five-thunder talisman was sent out by you.” 

Li Zhen smiled, “If Miss She Yue wants to hold me accountable, she must survive to leave!” 

The Dragon Lord said, “Having once peered at the heavens, why must you return to being a frog at the bottom of a well? Observers are indeed just as foolish as your friend Chen Qingdu.” 

Li Zhen’s expression suddenly changed, and she lost all desire to bicker with the Dragon Lord. 

The Dragon Lord had sensed something was amiss even before Li Zhen did. 

Li Zhen was suddenly knocked off the city wall by the impact of sword energy. 

First stunned, she then hugged her head with both hands, letting her body drift as she fell to the ground, laughing heartily, “The Dragon Lord helping others with his sword; it’s truly a rare sight!” 

The Dragon Lord extended his hand, revealing his sword form, summoning the phenomena of heaven and earth, sweeping through the clouds, and obliterating everything in sight. 

The Dragon Lord’s sword Qi clashed with many ancient sword intents, like the grand contest of the Dao. 

Li Zhen, no longer daring to casually land, found herself in a predicament. In a hurry, she summoned a protective treasure, striving to resist the sword intents and energies that didn’t recognize any of the Lotus Blossom Mountain’s direct successors. 

The sword lord struck forcefully toward the opposite city wall, holding nothing back. 

If not, She Yue would severely damage the foundations of the Dao, for which the Dragon Lord had no concern; it was her own doing. However, the Dragon Lord would never allow Chen Ping'an to gain any benefits from the Dao! 

Earlier, allowing She Yue to approach the city wall for a chat, whether to discuss the Dao or spar, was merely the Dragon Lord throwing a stray bone to a lost dog. 

In Chen Ping'an’s heart, a single sword was all he needed to shatter the bright moon. 

She Yue’s form drifted within the earthly cage, though not entirely She Yue, she was still a caged bird. 

With another strike, 

Chen Ping'an’s true self fell alongside his golden deity. 

Heaven and earth shared a sword. 

That form rapidly consolidated into a part of She Yue’s essence, cleaved apart, and shattered again and again, pulverizing her essence and Dao techniques. 

Chen Ping'an looked up, scoffing. 

The Dragon Lord’s previous strike, it seemed, wasn’t too swift after all. 

Above half of the Sword Qi Great Wall, heaven and earth returned to clarity. 

The Dragon Lord swept through the chaotic sword energy and fragmented moonlight, then grasped it again. 

A pale-faced girl with a round face stood beside the Dragon Lord, hoarsely saying, “She Yue thanks the Dragon Lord.” 

The Dragon Lord glanced at She Yue’s aura and remarked, “Fortunately, the foundations of the Dao were not heavily damaged. Take this opportunity to correct your temperament, diligently practice in the world of righteousness for a period, and you should be able to make it up.” 

She Yue silently nodded. 

A figure in a bright red robe stood opposite, gazing at She Yue, grinning, “Just a small mistake; I didn’t grasp the measure well, Miss She Yue, please forgive me.” 

She Yue had a lingering doubt in her heart but kept it hidden, not voicing it. Currently, with the foundations of the Dao damaged, it was not easy. If not for her peculiar true form, indeed as Li Zhen said, she had a unique advantage, then an ordinary martial artist would be writhing in pain, and those cultivators would be in a state of panic, their futures within the Dao appearing bleak. 

Li Zhen, standing slightly farther from the Dragon Lord and She Yue, peeked toward the opposite side, only to see the hidden official raise a hand, revealing the most pure and compact moon in the world. 

It was likely to rival even the purest moon of the scholarly Chen Chun'an. 

Chen Ping'an’s palm moved slightly, the moon gently swaying as if atop the peaks of the patterned mountains on his palm. 

This was to compensate for the loss of that shattered moon in his heart, far exceeding what could be described as merely adequate. 

She Yue said, “Today’s conflict will surely be repaid.” 

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Come again when you have the chance. You are always welcome.” 

Chen Ping'an shifted his gaze towards the sneaky Li Zhen in the distance, smiling, “Look at Miss She Yue’s visiting gift, and then look at your meager demeanor. If I were you, I would have headbutted a wall and died.” 

Li Zhen, propping herself on the city wall, hung precariously in midair, her head peeking out, wearing a pitiful expression without uttering a word. 

Even though She Yue had suffered so terribly, it was wiser to keep a low profile around the hidden official. 

For on the record of the heavenly cycle, She Yue was the type of cultivator who could run away even if she couldn’t win; moreover, she was praised as the arsenal of the world, with countless divine techniques. Thus, she would have a significant advantage in battles at the same level. 

Yet, She Yue’s loss this time fundamentally stemmed from her not bringing her entire true form to this city wall. 

Li Zhen sighed deeply, realizing that this deal with the hidden official had not only yielded no loss but a considerable gain, which was quite disheartening. 

The Dragon Lord reopened the restrictions, and Chen Ping'an still held his hands in his sleeves, slightly nodding, his gaze lifted as he smiled at She Yue, saying, “Miss She Yue, I cannot see you off.” 

Chen Ping'an also found it peculiar that this round-faced girl, upon arriving in the world of righteousness, was so lackadaisical, not even killing anyone? 

Li Zhen jumped onto the city wall, but by then, She Yue had transformed into moonlight, vanishing in an instant, passing through the gates at the remnants of the Inverted Mountain, traveling thousands of miles, ultimately merging with most of her true self in Tongye Prefecture. 

Now, as the world of righteousness and the wild realm continually clashed, especially with Tongye Prefecture and Fuyun Prefecture gradually merging into the Dao, the heavenly timing was becoming increasingly aligned. 

It was no longer a sight of day and night divided by a single door. 

She Yue had a riddle in her heart: why did it seem that Chen Ping'an’s second strike was not his all-out effort? 

Otherwise, even with the Dragon Lord’s assistance, She Yue should have retained more of her moon essence. 

Yet, with a heart as large as her round face, she could not help but feel dismal; half of her moon essence had just been lost! 

On a mountain peak, the round-faced girl scrunched her face tightly and then slowly squatted down, gently patting her cheeks, comforting herself, saying, “It’s fine, it’s fine, don’t cry, don’t cry.” 

Chen Ping'an turned to leave. 

Unbeknownst to him, the Dragon Lord struck again. 

It seemed the Dragon Lord was genuinely enraged this time. 

His form dissipated, then reformed ahead. Chen Ping'an burst into laughter. 

On the opposite city wall, Li Zhen stealthily approached the gray-robed figure, “This time, She Yue returned home, not bringing her entire true form.” 

The hidden official truly spared no effort, betting big for big gains, which was quite impressive. 

The Dragon Lord ignored Li Zhen and, to himself, coldly laughed, “Daring to openly step on that name, you have no fear that the three leaders in the White Jade Capital will sense it.” 

Meanwhile, in the azure realm’s true White Jade Capital, a young Daoist with a lotus crown on his head walked along the railing, raising his hand to observe from afar, laughing, “What a good character, what a good name.” 

Chen Ping'an sat atop a city wall, his feet dangling, gently swinging. 

One hand cradled a small, pure moon, while the other flipped the short knife, which had been recklessly embellished with inscriptions in later generations. 

This dagger from Cutting Deer Mountain, later inscribed with the characters “Morning Dew,” eventually fell into the hands of the young man named Chen Ping'an. 

Chen Ping'an glanced at the miniature bright moon, smiled, and tucked it into his sleeve. 

In the future, when he gifted it to his first disciple, it would serve as a token for breaking through from the fifth realm to the sixth. 

If they had already entered the sixth realm and broken through to the seventh, it would present quite a challenge for the master. 

The dagger spun in Chen Ping'an's fingertips and on the back of his hand. 

Chen Ping'an suddenly came to a halt, sheathing the short knife, leaning against the city wall, and murmured quietly to himself. 

Fortunately, peace prevails, and the sun returns to the sky. What other grievance could there be, but the morning dew first? 

A Liang, upon returning to the Sword Qi Great Wall from the azure realm, had once shared a drink with Chen Ping'an, saying, “It’s truly a pity. 

You’ve never witnessed the three teachings debating, the old scholar who seems to have won even before he speaks, nor have you seen that spirited, vibrant sage of literature. 

You’ve never encountered that man whose hair has begun to gray slightly yet doesn't appear too aged. 

You’ve never seen the young Cui Zhan, dressed in white, plucking black seeds above the clouds. 

You’ve never seen the boy holding his head high after making a mistake. 

You’ve never seen the young Qi, who furrows his brow slightly while reading. 

You’ve never seen Liu Sixteen, who presses down on two heads to prevent the two brothers from fighting, grinning, then, at the master’s glance, slightly loosening one head so that the younger brother can gently kick the unreasonable elder brother. Eventually, the master plays the mediator, saying it’s enough, it’s enough. 

Little Qi crosses his arms, exuding an air of confidence, resembling the master during his teaching moments. 

The tall elder brother Cui Zhan gently rests his chin on the annoyed younger brother’s head, saying, “Alright, you’re the elder brother; let the younger brother have his way.” The younger Qi would take advantage of this, shaking his head at the elder brother, saying, “Do I need him to let me?” 

When both sides glared fiercely, the younger brother would scurry behind the older brother. But once the elder brother let go of the younger brother’s shoulders, Little Qi would feel something was amiss, promptly hiding behind the master, who would spread wide his arms, shielding the younger disciple, stepping left and right to intercept the fuming elder disciple named Zuo. 

Yes. 

Chen Ping'an had never witnessed these scenes. 

At that time, Chen Ping'an chuckled, raising his cup, drinking deeply, saying, “I have only heard you speak of them. Even merely hearing about them and imagining them brings me great joy.” 

Ah Liang observed the sorrow that seemed to escape from the smile of a young man, a sorrow that could not be easily hidden even through his empty cup. 

Sorrow is always so stubborn and cannot be contained by wine. 

So, in the end, Ah Liang drank up the last cup of wine, both lamenting and comforting, saying, “Since leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, it feels like I have aged. One day, a dark, skinny boy in straw sandals, accompanied by a little girl in a red cotton coat, walked toward me.” 

At that moment, atop the city wall, Chen Ping'an also longed to return to his hometown, to quickly walk toward many cherished individuals. 

The road home is long; even if I encounter many strangers along the way, I must earnestly behold them all. 

Chen Ping'an hugged his head with both hands, standing tall as he gazed toward the empty distance. 

The couplets and spring couplets at the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley must surely be replaced anew every year. 

As a traveler from afar, enduring the longing for home, it is certainly because I miss my hometown dearly. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 837: The Heart of a Swordsman Is Hard to Connect

Chen Ping'an suddenly stood up, his vision clearing as he respectfully clasped his fists towards a distant guest. With the Grand Sword Immortal no longer present, he found himself half a guest and half a host at the Sword Qi Great Wall, so it was only natural for him to assist in receiving visitors.

As his gaze swept across the vast expanse of land to the south, he spotted an unexpected elder. Chen Ping'an had no idea what kind of divine ability the elder had employed to render the carefully arranged mountain and water restrictions of the Epoch Account completely ineffective. When the gap in realms was too great, thinking too much was pointless.

He truly envied that elder who had gouged out his own eyes and thrown them across two worlds. With the vastness of heaven and earth at his disposal, where could he not wander? If he wished to return home, who could stop him? If he chose to close his doors to guests, who would dare to visit him?

It was indeed the way of cultivation to reach such heights.

Upon seeing the elder's abrupt appearance, the Dragon Lord tensed, his mood growing heavier. Clad in a flowing gray robe, the elder's sword aura formed a vague silhouette atop the southern city wall. The Dragon Lord remained silent, fixated on the sole great exception in the barren world.

This eccentric old blind man had, over the millennia, more or less adhered to the rules, merely guarding his own small patch of land. He took pleasure in commanding forbidden great demons and golden-armored deities, moving mountains by the hundred thousand to create a pristine, unblemished landscape.

The Dragon Lord harbored a sense of trepidation towards this man, yet he felt no awe. In fact, the Dragon Lord had known the old blind man for quite some time; they were familiar with each other, having once been on good terms. However, as the years passed, they had ultimately failed to become close friends.

Li Zhen, ever perceptive, sensed the situation was dire. Fearing that the divine beings would fight and the mortals would suffer, he wasted no time in taking to the skies on his sword, heading north. He even went as far as to hide by the main gate, exchanging quips with the sword-wielding man before finally asking Zhang Lu if he had any wine.

Zhang Lu, the Grand Sword Immortal, who was seated cross-legged by the tethering post, tossed a jar of Rain Dragon Sect's immortal brew to Li Zhen, saying it was sent by Xiao Xian. "Save some for yourself; I’m just like a swallow collecting mud now, with over two hundred jars piled up."

Li Zhen couldn't help but lament how the customs and atmosphere of the later generations at the Sword Qi Great Wall had been thoroughly spoiled by outsiders like A Liang and the Hidden Official. Nowadays, while swordsmanship might not be impressive, they all seemed to be talented conversationalists.

Sipping his wine leisurely, Li Zhen curved his fingers, lightly tapping the tethering post's cylindrical top. "There are four posts in total, two in front and two behind. Historically, they’ve tethered dragons, cattle, horses, and monkeys. It’s a pity we need to suppress this main gate for now; otherwise, that old Yuan Shou would be green with envy. If he passed by here again, he’d surely smash one post and take the other three for himself."

Zhang Lu chuckled. "In the end, it's still that womanizer who can’t beat your master."

Yuan Shou was one of the great demons of the throne, wielding a sword while brandishing a long staff on the battlefield. His arms were long like a monkey's, and in his hand was a rough stone string, made from the magnificent mountains that had vanished throughout the history of the barren world, initially relocated by the demon who called himself Yuan Shou using his innate powers, then carefully refined into a rosary.

This time, Yuan Shou had already visited the regions of Haoran and the southeast of Tongye Island and the southwest of Fuyiao Island. Wherever he went, he smashed any mountain peaks that had ancestor halls, regardless of size.

Li Zhen jumped onto another tethering post for cattle at the gate, imitating Zhang Lu’s cross-legged seated position, sipping wine while contemplating how to trick a second jar out of him.

Zhang Lu asked, "Your family's Great Moon has lost another phase. Previously, she made a round trip to the Cursed Moon, and her aura seems to have changed. Did she have a confrontation with Chen Ping'an? She looks quite injured."

Li Zhen nodded, expressing regret. "Just suffered a minor setback. Sister Cursed Moon is quite formidable; even landing in the eleventh position isn’t a challenge for her. When she gets truly angry, she can easily make the Hidden Official kneel and beg for mercy. A lifetime of reputation ruined in an instant. Thankfully, not many witnessed this, just me and the Dragon Lord. And I’m the kind of person who keeps my mouth shut, preferring to bury my thoughts unless... someone offers me a drink, then I might chat a bit more."

Zhang Lu laughed. "You shouldn't be getting any wine."

Li Zhen remarked, "I heard you and Chen Ping'an are old acquaintances? You’ve crossed paths many times?"

Zhang Lu patted the tethering post beneath him. "As a gatekeeper, I have to engage with all the outsiders coming and going."

During the Thirteen Conflict, Zhang Lu had lost and was demoted here to guard the gate.

Li Zhen looked up at the sky, gently placing his wine jug on top of the post. Suddenly, he chuckled inwardly. "Guarding the gate, as Zhang Lu said, is true, but not entirely. A sword of justice ultimately left a mark in your homeland for a reason. That little Taoist boy seems to casually toss a mat, spending his days sitting near this tethering post, passing the time, but there’s surely a principle and method to it."

Turning to Zhang Lu, he said with a hint of pity, "You seem to always be so anxious, which is why your outcome doesn’t seem to be so favorable."

Zhang Lu surprisingly tossed a jug of Lu Hua Island's stored immortal brew to Li Zhen.

Li Zhen exclaimed in delight, "I thought I’d never drink the Grand Sword Immortal's brew again."

Zhang Lu replied, "It’s rare for you to speak the truth, so you ought to have some wine."

Li Zhen placed the full jug of wine next to the empty one, one on the left and one on the right, unexpectedly feeling a touch of melancholy, murmuring, "Remembering is not as good as forgetting, knowing is not as good as not knowing."

Only true wise men, those who have attained the Dao, genuinely fear the impermanence of the grand path.

Zhang Lu smiled. "Looks like Chen Ping'an winning against Cursed Moon has put you in a sour mood."

Li Zhen extended his hand towards the Grand Sword Immortal, who was drinking, and said, "In the past, I wandered by the osmanthus tree, dropping my poetic hooks into the mortal realm. Today, I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon, while the Earthly Swordsman drinks heavenly blessings. Quite fitting. Allow me to offer a couplet in exchange for a jug of wine. Don’t let an old friend be left empty-handed."

Zhang Lu waved him off. "Scram."

With a sigh, Li Zhen could only uncork the jug and silently converse with Huan Bo.

He pondered what that old blind man was doing at the Sword Qi Great Wall. If the old blind man and the Dragon Lord engaged in a life-or-death struggle, the riverbed would surely shift, adding more chaos to the mix.

Li Zhen laughed, "What does it have to do with me?" 

Then he cried, "Why am I here?"

Zhang Lu cast a glance at the young sword cultivator, noticing that it seemed Chen Ping'an hadn’t managed to gain any advantage.

The young Hidden Official, trapped in one place for too long, hadn’t lost his mind, while the disciples of the freely wandering Moon-Treading Mountain were nearing insanity.

Chen Ping'an didn’t remain standing on the high city wall for long; stepping forward, he plunged downward, intending to land straight on his feet. However, before his feet could touch the ground, he was unexpectedly met with a sword strike from the Dragon Lord without warning.

The Dragon Lord held a grudge.

Chen Ping'an could only slightly alter his intentions, appearing on a brushstroke of the city wall that was closest to the ground.

He made an effort to stay as close to that elder as possible. Speaking with an elder at the highest point would be too disrespectful. Whether the elder took offense was a matter of his own temperament; whether the younger one cared was a matter of upbringing and etiquette.

This wasn’t only true for the Grand Sword Immortal and the old blind man; it was a principle Chen Ping'an adhered to throughout his journeys, traversing countless mountains and rivers.

At the old blind man's feet lay a listless old dog, bored out of its mind, who lifted a paw and lightly scratched at the ground.

If only Chen Ping'an could break through the restrictions of the Epoch Account, he would surely call out to the Dragon Lord, urging him to come quickly to see a relative down below.

The old blind man first spoke to the Dragon Lord, "As long as we don’t fight, I’ll chat with the Hidden Official for a few moments."

The Dragon Lord nodded.

Though the old blind man had a foul temper, he always spoke candidly and could be trusted.

Then the old blind man turned his head, "Which dialect of the Sword Qi Great Wall is more familiar, and which is more refined for the barren world?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "It's all up to you, elder."

The old blind man chuckled. Chen Qingdu truly favored this kind of straightforward yet subtly refined younger generation.

Chen Qingdu had never liked to share his innermost thoughts; he had been like that since ancient times.

Just like A Liang, who had once crawled and snuck up the mountain, showing off at his own doorstep, saying that a man who only enjoyed drinking alone must have many stories to tell.

Of course, A Liang, apart from boasting and flattering, claimed that both hosts and guests were men with stories. He also wanted to trick the old blind man into sharing some ancient tales.

The old blind man had not granted him that wish, but he saw no reason not to drink the wine A Liang brought.

Suddenly, the old blind man kicked the lazy dog, barking, "You’re a flying ascendant! Haven’t you seen money before?! Or do you think there’s shit on the ground to eat?"

The old dog nearly managed to unearth a somewhat valuable lost treasure from the depths of this battlefield site.

After a few rolls, it let out a whimper and simply laid down, refusing to move.

Chen Ping'an maintained his usual smile. Indeed, a dignified ascendant should have some pride and not compete with a mere Nascent Soul junior over what little treasures the heavens offered.

The sickly old dog opened its eyes, glancing at the young Hidden Official in a bright red robe. Hearing the sword immortals who were guests of the mountain, it realized that this young man was indeed a master of picking up money. Old blind man, you truly are blind; you scold your own dog instead of the outsiders.

The old blind man asked the young man in the barren tongue, "How did you know of Cursed Moon’s hiding place? Cursed Moon has only been in this world for a few years, and even over at Moon-Treading Mountain, they keep things hidden. There shouldn’t be any records of her at the summer palace."

"I’m just gambling on a slight chance!" 

Chen Ping'an didn’t even bother using his heart voice and spoke directly: "I almost simultaneously summoned three formations, and Cursed Moon remained calm and collected, even choosing not to rely on her innate moon spirit to break through and swap her loss for my gain. So she practically handed me the answer. She was also gambling, betting whether I could find her. Maintaining three great formations requires a drain of spiritual energy, while she could observe from her heart’s moon wall. Why wouldn’t she want to?"

Gently, Chen Ping'an knocked his fist against his chest and smiled, "Far away in the heavens or close at hand, what's even closer is the inner state of us cultivators. Having seen the bright moon, we all carry it within ourselves, whether bright or dim. Even if it's just a reflection in our heart lake, it could serve as the best hiding place for Cursed Moon. Of course, this is predicated on the fact that her realm isn’t too far apart from mine; otherwise, it would just be a trap for her. Meeting a junior like me, she could afford to be so reckless, but if she were to encounter an elder, she wouldn’t dare act so recklessly."

As for some truths that teetered on the edge of exaggeration, Chen Ping'an didn’t feel comfortable voicing them in front of the elder.

What of Cursed Moon? In my realm, I still manage to gain the upper hand, successfully dealing out two strikes before she needs the Dragon Lord’s intervention to stop my second strike.

The old blind man nodded.

Compared to when Chen Qingdu was young, he had become far more meticulous.

Back then, among the many sword cultivators in the world, those who pondered the most acted with careful consideration. The Dragon Lord would simply shout and strike, his sharpness fully displayed. Meanwhile, Chen Qingdu, amid wielding his sword, preferred to observe everything—studying the world and the heavens, seeking to learn from all. As for brains and perception, at a similar age, he truly had less than this Hidden Official.

Thus, it was said that scholars were never good people.

The old blind man inquired again, "If Cursed Moon is willing to sacrifice even a bit of her innate moon spirit to shatter your peculiar flying sword, what would you do?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head and finally spoke with his heart voice, "She can't do that. If she tries, I'll let her go. I would remove that caged bird and maintain only the Wellspring Moon. At most, I could shatter it using a Thunder Seal to exchange for her moon spirit to help refine my flying sword, Wellspring Moon. Even so, the deal would still be profitable."

Using the essence of the bright moon to refine the Wellspring Moon, sharpening its edge, even now, just thinking about it, Chen Ping'an felt that if he ever had the chance to reunite with Cursed Moon, they could still give it a try.

In truth, whether he could retain Cursed Moon wasn’t something Chen Ping'an was particularly attached to.

Especially after realizing that Cursed Moon, during her time in the Haoran realm, had hardly killed anyone, his murderous intent was even less pronounced.

Earlier, upon her arrival at the city wall, he had regarded her as a demon of the barren world.

Chen Ping'an, of course, had initially been ready to cut down anyone who dared to cross him, thinking he was still on a battlefield facing the entire demonic army of the barren world.

Yet when it turned into a genuine confrontation, his mindset immediately shifted.

Moreover, Chen Ping'an worried that Cursed Moon might return in a fit of rage, fully restored, to the Sword Qi Great Wall, ready to engage him in a do-or-die showdown.

Thus, he ultimately withdrew, only seizing half of her moon spirit.

As he thought of this, he raised his head to the heavens. The sun, moon, and stars operated regularly, there was originally a void that counted as Cursed Moon’s cultivation ground. She plucked the moon from the heavens to the mortal realm, with one full moon divided, I received one piece. Quite satisfactory.

If he were back in his hometown, a moderately ranked lotus root blessed land would present an exceptionally bright suspended moon—an all-inclusive reunion on the Mid-Autumn Festival, where families gather under the full moon.

Every year on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the full moon shone like a great mirror, and everyone in the blessed lands could see all those they wished to see, except themselves.

Of course, he had promised to gift it to his eldest disciple as a breakthrough in martial arts, and Chen Ping'an felt no reluctance.

Outside the city on the vast land, the old blind man continued to nod gently.

Though the Hidden Official’s scholarly identity was somewhat eye-catching, a young man who was clever enough was surely no mistake. If he could also hope for better times ahead, that would be even better.

Historically, there had been a scholar from the Haoran realm who was a novelist. He first traveled to the Sword Qi Great Wall, then to the Hundred Thousand Great Mountains, not low in rank and reasonably skilled. After finding the old blind man, he spoke with conviction, saying, "Us literati, when we write on paper, only write about how true the world is. We only need to write about the tragic events and the pitiable people in the world, and how the readers feel, without taking responsibility. It’s up to the readers whether they grow more desperate and numb. We just want everyone to know how unbearable and intolerable this world is..."

In the end, he was met with the old blind man’s annoyance. Regardless of how many paths there were in the grand Dao, you could walk whichever you wished. It wasn’t his son or disciple, so the old blind man couldn't be bothered.

But coming to his doorstep, ruining the rules, and daring to come empty-handed, he had to leave something behind.

The reason he was only half-dead wasn't because the old blind man had shown mercy, but because the novelist’s ancestor had hurriedly arrived and rescued the remnants of his soul, taking him back to the Haoran realm.

A Liang, who stood by, wore an expression of amusement, as if to say, "I didn’t do anything at all."

Later, A Liang returned, unexpectedly sober. He said a few words of reason, suggesting that no matter how good a classic work was, it still wasn’t good enough. He was just a coward, trying to share the burdens of his heart with readers.

Even if a piece was well-written, it wasn’t the best. It still divided thoughts. Was it heartfelt writing cold words, or merely writing with a cold heart? 

Was it lamenting the heavens for great sorrow, or merely lamenting that the world’s beings did not share in his sorrow? There was a world of difference.

The same writing, the same tragic prose, yet with warm and cold hearts alike. Ordinary people might casually flip through a book, unaware of the depths, but a scholar seeking to cultivate peace could not remain oblivious.

The old blind man then asked him why he didn’t write himself.

That good-for-nothing merely leaned against the wooden gate, running a hand through his hair, saying, "I’ve seen too many novelists who don’t need pens to write. They write with their lives in the mortal realm, shining brightly, whether in lengthy tomes that span millennia or short tales that last decades. 

Some are intoxicating to read, while others break the heart upon sight. But all are the true good writings in A Liang's heart."

Seeing that the old elder had been silent for a long while, Chen Ping'an couldn't help but ask, "Elder, have you come this time with something for me to do?"

The old blind man collected his thoughts and shook his head. "Just came to have a look."

The old dog dared only to mutter complaints in its heart; the old blind man had lost both eyes, and it felt contempt for him.

It somewhat missed that good-for-nothing A Liang; only when the old blind man encountered him would he find himself at a loss.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an bowed deeply.

The old blind man laughed, saying, "What’s this? Are you trying to urge me to exert myself more?"

Chen Ping'an straightened his back. "I’m merely expressing my gratitude that the elder’s disillusionment could allow me to be disappointed for ten thousand years."

As the ancient saying goes, mountains rise majestically, born of heaven’s inequity.

This elder, having been trapped like a painting for ten thousand years, harbored more grievances in his heart.

The old blind man nodded, raising a skeletal hand to scratch at his cheek, unexpectedly smiling a little. "Very well; I almost couldn’t help but beat you half to death. You’re indeed clever and know how to cherish your blessings. Otherwise, I suppose the Dragon Lord and Liu Cha wouldn’t have come looking for trouble with you."

Chen Ping'an could only bitterly smile.

This elder, who had made the Grand Sword Immortal visit him twice, didn’t seem like someone who would joke around.

The old blind man turned to leave.

He truly only came to take a look and chat casually.

As for the Dragon Lord, the old blind man had nothing much to say, and it seemed the same for the Dragon Lord. Old friends from the past had become like strangers.

The ascendant old dog scurried after the old blind man.

The Dragon Lord too dissipated, returning to a flowing gray robe.

Chen Ping'an suddenly called out, "Old elder, how is A Liang doing?"

The old blind man did not turn back but replied, "Just a turtle at the mountain, that good-for-nothing is quite happy."

Chen Ping'an felt both worried and relieved; it seemed he wouldn’t have to worry about A Liang visiting anytime soon.

As Chen Ping'an took one last look, he saw that the mountain and water restrictions had reopened, but what he saw in his heart was the Moon-Treading Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, standing in stark contrast. The mountains and rivers were different, but old friends were safe and sound.

He felt the urge to drink again.

Chen Ping'an stealthily pulled out a jug of wine from the fifteenth flying sword and then moved it into his sleeve's small world. Just as he took it out to have a sip, the Dragon Lord struck the jug and the wine shattered into pieces.

Chen Ping'an had grown used to this; his figure flickered and vanished, returning to the city wall, walking like a student, shoulders swaying with his big sleeves, loudly proclaiming how delicious the stinky tofu was. Paired with the stewed old dog meat, it had to be a unique delicacy.

Unbeknownst to him, he couldn’t bear to see the world outside the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The old blind man, however, clearly "saw" the scenery atop the city wall.

The old dog, seizing the moment while the old blind man was in a good mood, grumbled, "I didn’t provoke him; we’ve only met once, and he’s already thinking about my flesh. How infuriating."

The old blind man scoffed, "Who do you think you are to provoke the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall? Whose courage borrowed yours?"

The old dog didn’t dare to argue back, only submissively wagging its tail in supplication.

Far away, a great land beyond a thousand miles from Moon-Treading Mountain had been temporarily designated as a forbidden area.

A jug of fine wine was set there, deliberately left behind by the old blind man.

The powerful demons stationed at Moon-Treading Mountain didn’t dare to move the jug, turning a blind eye to its solitary presence on the ground.

Even though it was confirmed that the jug contained no abnormalities, merely ordinary wine, the great demons still refrained from touching it.

In the barren world, where the strong were revered for ten thousand years, the old blind man, holding sway over a territory, was one of the few at the peak of fourteen realms.

Now, in the barren world, after Xiao Xian had visited the ancient well’s abyss, another had emerged. However, she achieved her status through the fate of the barren world rather than simply through her innate flying sword.

The fourteen realms were far too profound and unpredictable; no one could inquire about the differences between them.

In fact, A Liang could have answered those questions, but who would dare to provoke, adding fuel to the fire and snow to the frost? Did they truly think he couldn’t leave Moon-Treading Mountain?

Moon-Treading Mountain and A Liang were both suppressive forces, yet they also maintained a subtly delicate balance of non-interference. 

After all, A Liang himself was unwilling to relinquish that path to seek a sword at Moon-Treading Mountain.

A great demoness, who could be considered Li Zhen's senior, with the beauty and grace of the Haoran realm, arrived at the chaotic void beneath Moon-Treading Mountain.

From a distance, she gazed at the scholar sitting cross-legged, surrounded by a multitude of golden characters that served as a mat, looking much like an outsider who had come to borrow the mountain for cultivation.

She couldn’t understand why this man would choose such a path. The renowned Mr. Wen from the Sea of Literature had once explained the great truth of "If a man does not act for himself, heaven will punish him."

Thus, she found it even harder to comprehend A Liang's self-destructive path.

The scruffy man noticed the Moon-Treading Mountain woman cultivator and immediately straightened up. "Sister New Makeup, why do you still wear the same old guise as when we first met? Meeting old friends in old attire is truly poetic."

The woman demoness, known as New Makeup, recalled their past meeting and frowned, "Shut your mouth!"

Had her own nonsense hit a wall?

A Liang was not one to fear such situations, wearing a deeply affectionate expression. "It seems sister New Makeup still remembers our first encounter well, which comforts my heart. There are few good men worth a hundred years of memory for you."

New Makeup scoffed, "If you had made a different choice, how many swords would you have used to cut me down?"

A Liang felt a bit embarrassed; this woman truly knew how to strike hard. 

New Makeup, not understanding the deeper meaning, thought he was merely lost in thought, distractedly navigating the sword intent while suppressing the void beneath them.

A Liang figured this was a rare opportunity and would have to pull out all the stops.

Having reconnected, he still looked handsome, and with a higher level of swordsmanship, he was sure this sister had grown used to it. So, he decided to bring a touch of poetic romance.

A Liang cleared his throat and moistened his vocal cords.

Unexpectedly, New Makeup coldly laughed, "Shut up."

This man, who had once traveled the barren world on his sword, because of continuous troubles, his sword-wielding demeanor had been witnessed by many great demons.

While leaning on his waist with both hands, he loudly recited poetry, claiming it was the style of both sword immortals and poets. It was worth noting he was still being pursued by the great demons attacking with techniques.

A Liang sighed, feeling that beautiful women lacked appreciation for romance; they were the most unflattering when they disappointed good men.

New Makeup asked, "With your cultivation, why don't you cherish it properly?"

A Liang responded, "I can answer sincerely, but sister New Makeup must first listen to a few words from me."

New Makeup nodded.

As expected, there were no surprises.

The man clapped his knees, smiling and reciting poetry.

Not much smile, but loud enough, "This is my A Liang's original creation, the Three Farewell Song."

"Shu Road is difficult, let’s drink, dreaming of the heavenly maid, bidding farewell."

"Pipa Song, Long Regret Song, an ancient wild grass to send off."

"Ah, Wang Sun, no home to part from, a painted calligraphy gift to General Cao."

"If it weren’t for the exam topic, it could be changed to that Mud Skill Mountain, carrying firewood, a hundred and fifty nights against the moon, that would also be quite nice."

"Washing the soldiers’ horses, gifting flowers, walking alone by the river seeking a perfect couplet. Hmm, if replaced with the Three Rivers watching the rising water's ten verses, it seems even better."

"What a fine fellow! Such a stream of literary thought flows like a rushing spring, like a wheel that can’t be stopped, impressive, truly impressive."

New Makeup said, "Are you done babbling?"

Finally, A Liang nodded, his expression a mix of amusement and seriousness, resting his fists on his knees, speaking to himself, "What a scene where Jia Sheng weeps, and no one remains. What a sight to behold, drunk as a horse falls, no need to laugh at people; I invite all to drink and watch."

New Makeup remained silent, waiting for the answer.

Why was A Liang so careless with a sword cultivator of the fourteenth realm?

"Because I cherish this hard-earned fourteenth realm."

A Liang didn’t play the rogue, smiling and saying, "It’s a pity sister New Makeup, you’re not young anymore and have traveled too little, so you don’t understand. After all, it’s hard for the heart of a swordsman to connect." 

New Makeup fell silent.

Whether swordsman or sword cultivator, the entire realm acknowledged it.

Only this man, who acted overly "refined," was truly off-putting; it made one feel that there was no need to be so pretentious; simply be your sword immortal.

New Makeup had once asked Mr. Zhou what he would choose if the Haoran realm was filled with people like A Liang.

Mr. Zhou had smiled, saying that he wouldn’t come to their hometown, and that A Liang was A Liang precisely because there was only one A Liang.

It was said that A Liang had roamed the barren world alone with his sword multiple times, seeking Zhou Mi, who had once been disheartened in the Haoran realm, only to weep with ghosts and gods.

But Zhou Mi had always been unwilling to meet him.

Suddenly, A Liang stood, his expression solemn, and recited the wise words he had read in his youth, words imbued with the divine meaning he grasped early on.

"Eyes reach for miles, heart wanders the vast wilds, spirit breaking the ground, heaven rises in response."

"Clouds churn and dragons change, spring brings tree blossoms. Is creation in my heart or my hands?"

All of A Liang's words transformed into massive golden characters, slamming into the abyss beneath the golden mat.

The characters further manifested into a golden dragon, spring winds and tree blossoms, appearing amidst the white clouds, suppressing the soaring malevolence.

Confucian sages exuded righteousness. With heaven's mandate in their mouths, their words followed the law.

Deep beneath, there were tremors like the heavens collapsing and the earth splitting, as if roads were blocked, having to retreat temporarily, but the residual momentum still slowly reached the golden mat.

Making New Makeup feel utterly astounded.

The man rubbed his head and cheerfully asked the Moon-Treading Mountain demoness, "Are scholars fierce?!"

(End of Chapter)

 

 **Chapter 838: Jia Sheng's Disappointment (Part 1)**

Before Liu Sixteen left the Desolate Mountain (Luoposhan) to head towards the Old Dragon City (Laolongcheng) battlefield, the burly man who called himself "Jun Qian" paid a visit to the Master Hall at the Jise Peak (Jise Feng) to pay his respects. He also made a trip to the first floor of the bamboo building at Desolate Mountain. Aside from a wooden plank bed placed in the corner, the rest of the space resembled a study.

The little steward, Nuan Shu, unlocked the door with a key, and Shumi Li stood at the threshold, holding a green bamboo staff and a golden shoulder pole, acting as a guardian with his chest puffed out and standing straight.

Liu Sixteen opened several neatly arranged books on the table. Most of the pages were filled with densely packed annotations written in small script. If the writing truly conveyed the author's thoughts, then the younger disciple must have been a serious and meticulous scholar. After all, Master Brother Cui Shan’s treasured collection was just like this; whenever he encountered different interpretations in books, he would have Little Qi transcribe them, resulting in dozens of notes written in the margins of a single book.

Liu Sixteen returned the books to their places and glanced up, noticing a pair of couplets hanging on the wall, featuring a blue background with golden characters depicting cloud bats. According to Shumi Li, these were scavenged by the younger disciple from Beiju Luzhou.

*Three feet of sword amidst the storm outside the mountain, when there's a matter, draw the sword and descend the mountain.*

*In a room filled with flowers and birds, without worries, read the sages and the wise.*

Liu Sixteen, who appeared rugged, was actually quite observant. He quickly noticed a seal in the corner of the couplets that read “Chen Shiyi.”

With both literary and martial prowess, he cultivated strength and heart.

Before returning to the mountain, Liu Sixteen first went to Yang's shop to guard the formation for the Eastern Duke, then accompanied Ruan Xiu to the Celestial Canopy to host guests. Their wishes fulfilled, they smashed two enemies with their fists, and two golden rains fell upon the northern region of the continent, with half of the golden body fragments collected by the long-lived friend and the other half gifted to Cloud-Piercing Mountain.

That little girl, Ruan Xiu, was even bolder, directly crossing the threshold and venturing into the sky. One wondered if she had managed to meet the Sage of Rites.

After returning to the mountain, Liu Sixteen received a minor official position from the right protector of the Desolate Mountain, titled "Mountain Patrol Envoy." Shumi Li remarked that the position was not significant, so he shouldn’t complain.

While patrolling the mountain, the man stretched out his arms, one holding a little girl in a pink skirt, the other a girl in black, as they walked together in the morning light.

Once during a patrol, a little lotus fairy sat on his head, admiring the moonlight together.

The Azure Youth Heavenly Sovereign reopened the Ascension Platform in the mortal realm, which was a tremendous blessing for many earth immortals and practitioners in the continent.

An Ascension Platform.

A genuine ascent to an ancient ruin, eventually leading to a dilapidated heavenly gate towering above the sea of clouds.

Throughout this process of the heavenly platform rising, it served as a kind of tempering of the Great Way.

Any earth immortal practitioner who could maintain their Dao heart and keep their soul intact could reach the summit. Although they would inevitably be unable to cross the severely restricted ancient gate, simply standing outside the heavenly gate amidst the clouds was already a fulfillment of merit.

Many practitioners fell from the Ascension Platform, returning to the mortal world with varying degrees of success, depending on how high they ascended.

Seventy to eighty percent experienced significant gains. Xu Hun, the lord of Qingfeng City, donned his wart-covered armor and stood firm as a mountain on the Ascension Platform. He finally broke through the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul realm and entered the upper five realms.

Liu Baqiao, a swordsman from the Wind and Thunder Garden, was relatively unfortunate. Due to a flaw in his sword heart, he remained stuck in the Nascent Soul stage. He had nearly grasped a hint of the Great Way, but it seemed that inner demons had plagued him, causing significant injury. After taking a major step forward, he found himself unable to take a second step and even slightly retreated. However, even just transitioning from the Golden Core stage to the genuine Nascent Soul stage, Liu Baqiao had a decent report for his senior brother, Huang He, who was about to relinquish his title as the garden lord. Otherwise, if Liu Baqiao returned empty-handed, he felt that with his senior brother's temperament, he might be sent away and confined to the mountain for a hundred years—never to descend again until he achieved the Nascent Soul.

Liu Baqiao, like Xu Hun, reached the summit above the sea of clouds but soon found himself unavoidably returning to the mortal realm. He revisited the small town and went to the construction office, where he had a pleasant reunion with Supervisor Cao, whom he met for the first time, over drinks.

Cai Jinjian, a female Golden Core immortal from Yunxia Mountain, was a bit of a surprise. Given her talent, several masters on the mountain had not anticipated that she would reach the Nascent Soul stage in this lifetime. Yet, she managed to hold on until the end, even catching a glimpse of the heavenly gate, which was quite an accomplishment.

This time, Cai Jinjian's ascent could be considered a leap to the heavens. If all goes well, upon her return to her sect, in addition to the master chair she had previously been given, she would likely become the youngest female master in Yunxia Mountain's history.

Many immortal residences in Baoping Continent often saw practitioners become Golden Core guests. Besides being able to open their own peaks and announce their presence across the continent, they could also elevate their standing in the sect's hierarchy. If fortunate enough to reach the Nascent Soul stage, they would ascend even higher.

As for the upper five realms, they could easily establish their own sects.

After exiting the Ascension Platform, Cai Jinjian found herself alone outside an old academy. She gazed at the empty classroom, lost in thought.

Jiang Yun, a dark-clothed man from the Jiang family of Yunlin, did not immediately rush to the Eastern Sea front to join his master and the Grand General Wei Liang. Instead, he lingered for a moment, mirroring Liu Baqiao and Cai Jinjian's choices, revisiting the familiar Lihuzhou town.

However, when he arrived at the iron lock well, he felt somewhat disappointed. The iron chain that once hung down into the well had long been refined into his life-bound object. This allowed him to successfully refine a small personal realm into the long-lost "Iron Mountain Jungle" and "Crystal Clear Dojo," and he now possessed a treasure that was both offensive and defensive.

This time, Jiang Yun also ascended to the Nascent Soul realm.

Other earth immortals experienced varying degrees of advancement in their realms. Those fortunate enough to see the heavenly gate's ancient visage were still in the minority.

Out of the earth immortals who secretly came to this place, only about twenty to thirty percent left empty-handed and returned, having gained nothing, quickly falling off the Ascension Platform.

However, they dared not show any change in expression.

The only "compensation" was that they did not break their mirrors here; the earth immortals would not need to accumulate too much merit for the upcoming battles in Old Dragon City.

Sui Youbiao, within the True Realm Sect at Shujian Lake, had recently broken through the bottleneck of the Dragon Gate realm, making her the least experienced Golden Core earth immortal among this group.

However, Sui Youbiao's transition from a pure martial artist to a sword practitioner was already a remarkable feat. In just over a decade, she had become a Golden Core sword practitioner, astonishing many. Yet, both Yuguizong and the True Realm Sect had concealed a lot about her.

If it weren't for Sui Youbiao's identity as a direct disciple of the sub-sect of Yuguizong, during this gathering at the Ascension Platform, all the earth immortals from Baoping Continent, who were all sharp-minded individuals, would surely have raised suspicions about her.

Unfortunately, Sui Youbiao was unable to break through this time and only reached the bottleneck of the Golden Core stage.

She merely glimpsed more heavenly scenery than the average earth immortal.

*I wish to follow the master to the heavenly platform, casually sweeping away fallen flowers with the immortals.*

It's a pity that there was no master beside her, and no immortals in the sky.

In truth, Sui Youbiao had a certain opportunity to ascend to the Nascent Soul stage. However, for reasons unknown, she deliberately suppressed her eager sword during a crucial moment when the long sword she carried was willing to protect her path.

Because she did not draw her sword and refused to resist the heavenly winds with her sword intent, relying solely on her solid practitioner’s physique and focused spirit, she lost an even greater opportunity.

After exiting the Ascension Platform, Sui Youbiao's sword heart was clear. Not only did she not show any signs of dejection, but her Dao heart also grew more resolute. She bought some pastries at the New Year's shop on Qilong Alley and then rode the wind towards the state city.

Along with Sui Youbiao, leaving Shujian Lake were two direct disciples of the True Realm Sect brought by Sect Master Wei Ying from the Upper Sect's Jiu Yi Peak to Baoping Continent. Both companions of Sui Youbiao traveling north were also sword practitioners and direct disciples of Wei Ying. The young woman, named Sui Yu, was particularly eager to visit the Sword Qi Great Wall to verify whether the sword immortal Mi Yu was as handsome as her master.

A young man named Nian Jiu seemed to be completely oblivious to worldly affairs beyond cultivating and practicing swordsmanship. His only task was to stop his beloved senior sister from going to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

However, their names recorded in the True Realm Sect's mountain and water register were Wei Gusu and Wei Xianyou.

Their life-bound swords were called "Fish Dragon" and "Wine Pot," both named by their master, Wei Ying. Sui Yu liked hers, and Nian Jiu liked his because the wine pot contained a hidden world.

They exited the Ascension Platform slightly earlier than Sui Youbiao.

Previously, they had temporarily stayed at an immortal guesthouse in the state city, owned by a young man named Dong, who was renowned in the North Mountain region for his beauty, earning him the nickname "Half a City."

Even with the discerning tastes of Sui Yu and Nian Jiu, they found the guesthouse's environment serene and exceptional, making it their top choice for future visits.

Sui Yu remarked telepathically, "Sui Youbiao is so attractive; even Master likes her. Why don't you like her?"

Nian Jiu replied earnestly, "I only like those who like themselves."

Sui Yu grew furious, calling her thick-headed junior brother a fool and shouted, "Drop dead!"

Sui Youbiao landed outside the guesthouse. The Dong Water Well's immortal guesthouse was not large but had strict rules; even guests could not casually ride the wind to enter or exit, only able to walk through the door.

Sui Youbiao found Wei Gusu and Wei Xianyou and simply said, "To the Niujiao Ferry."

Wei Xianyou looked at Sui Youbiao and after a long gaze, he still felt a sense of amazement. The young man thought to himself that if his senior sister continued to be so unreasonable, he might just start liking someone else.

Sui Youbiao and the two direct disciples of the True Realm Sect had sword talismans, allowing them to ride the wind freely in the Longzhou region. As a direct disciple of the Desolate Mountain, Sui Youbiao naturally already possessed a Dragon Spring Sword Sect’s talisman sword, but spending True Realm Sect's money for an extra one was no trouble.

With her sword on her back, Sui Youbiao rode the wind towards the Niujiao ferry.

The long sword, once lost and then found, was both infatuated and hungry.

It was just unclear who was infatuated with whom and who was the master and who was the heartbreaker.

A man and a woman left the Qingfeng City region under the cover of night, carefully concealing their appearances and traces. Once they entered the North Mountain region, it felt as if they were simply enjoying a scenic tour. The age difference between the elderly man and the young girl was stark; the old man was hunched, while the young girl had a lovely complexion, not overly striking. Occasionally, the old man would take out a branch of pear blossoms and gently twirl it, which the young girl did not find embarrassing at all. If the beautiful innkeeper truly dared to do this, it would be a toss-up as to who would benefit.

The old man was somewhat excessive, teasing her about how she now resembled a rustic girl from the countryside.

It was none other than Zhu Lian and the Fox Kingdom's lord from Qingfeng City, one returning to his hometown while the other traveled far from home.

The current Qingfeng City must be in turmoil.

The lord of the Fox Kingdom, under the alias Pei Xiang, was a Nascent Soul practitioner with seven fox tails.

As for whether to place the Fox Kingdom in a lotus root blessed land, relatively isolated from the world, or to set it on a certain mountain peak of a vassal state, Zhu Lian primarily deferred to Pei Xiang’s wishes.

However, Pei Xiang still found it hard to believe that a Desolate Mountain could possess a medium-sized blessed land. After all, she trusted Zhu Lian but held doubts about the Desolate Mountain.

Zhu Lian chuckled, "I forgot to remind you, once we reach my home on the Mountain of Young Master, you must remember one principle: treat people with sincerity."

Pei Xiang felt somewhat anxious, her demeanor growing increasingly delicate. With charm surrounding her, she bit her lip, "You should be more specific. I have a good memory and am used to bowing my head and obeying others."

This was primarily due to her long dealings with the Xu family of Qingfeng City, where she feared the phrase "up the mountain."

Zhu Lian shook his head, "If I say too much, you will become complacent. Moreover, I don’t need to elaborate. My Desolate Mountain is quite pleasant; the storms outside are merely for sightseeing. Other mountain peaks, like Qingfeng City, have people bickering over silver coins. Desolate Mountain is different."

She then asked, "Are there any particularly petty women on Desolate Mountain? I'm quite afraid of that."

The Xu family woman still made Pei Xiang wary to this day.

Just thinking about the awkward situation that woman was in now made Pei Xiang unable to suppress a laugh. Women often enjoyed putting other women in difficult positions. That woman probably felt that her looks couldn't compare, so she enjoyed putting subtle jabs in her embroidered shoes, and now she was facing her retribution, wasn't she?

As the innkeeper said, Xu Hun had just entered the upper five realms and was just right for a celebratory occasion for Qingfeng City.

Indeed, Qingfeng City excelled at creating a buzz. First, the legitimate daughter married the commoner's son of the Yuan family, and then there were whispers of the Xu family seemingly using their cunning legitimate son to form a marriage alliance with the old sword immortal of the Tao family from Zhengyang Mountain. Now that Xu Hun had crossed the great threshold of the heavenly gate and entered the upper five realms, given Qingfeng City's temperament, unless a Fox Kingdom disappeared into thin air, not to mention Beiju Luzhou, the news would probably spread even to Aiai Continent.

Zhu Lian chuckled about how one could easily become complacent and suffer the consequences, which Pei Xiang wholeheartedly agreed with, feeling quite satisfied. At that moment, she received a gentle slap from Zhu Lian, who said, "And you?"

In the dusk, the two passed through the bustling Red Candle Town. As long as they crossed Qi Dune Mountain, the Desolate Mountain would be just ahead.

Pei Xiang felt a weight lift off her shoulders as she looked up to clearly see the cloud-wreathed Cloud-Piercing Mountain, giving her another boost of reassurance.

Zhu Lian bought a lot of sunflower seeds at a market stall and then led Pei Xiang down a street.

Pei Xiang softly asked, "Who are we going to see?"

Zhu Lian replied as they walked through the crowded street, "To meet the Water God of Danjiang, Li Jin."

Zhu Lian added, "He sells books, and we've always had a good relationship. After all, distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors."

Previously, due to the matter involving the Water Goddess of Yuyue River, it was inevitable that there would be some tension between the brothers Li Jin, after all, it's human nature to feel sorrow for another's misfortune.

This time, they would take the opportunity to help resolve the innkeeper's worries.

After all, Zhu Lian was never good at dealing with women.

Did women really need to be dealt with? 

In any case, Zhu Lian never needed to.

Pei Xiang understood this and knew that this bustling Red Candle Town, located at the confluence of three rivers, had three Water Gods, among which Li Jin had only been sealed by the Great Li for a few years, and the temple's incense was still quite good.

The Fox Kingdom was a place where all sorts of people mixed together, and news circulated quickly among the mountains, so Pei Xiang was well aware of many secrets and confidential matters in the continent.

As for Zhu Lian's acquaintance with Li Jin, Pei Xiang was not surprised. After all, although Li Jin held a significant position, he was still a newcomer in the "mountain and water bureaucracy" of the Great Li. He likely needed to establish a good rapport with the Desolate Mountain, and getting close to Desolate Mountain was almost equivalent to getting acquainted with the Mountain Lord Wei of Cloud-Piercing Mountain.

The Nascent Soul fox enchantress, "Pei Xiang," while only a realm apart from Wei Ban, differed vastly in both identity and true cultivation.

Now, a piece of news began to spread, stating that Lord Wei would soon advance to the next level, thanks to the three golden rains' nurturing and tempering. He would soon reach a state equivalent to that of an immortal, becoming one of the most refined mountain lords among the five peaks of the continent once again.

The innkeeper was a handsome young man in black, reclining in a wicker chair, sipping tea while reading.

However, Pei Xiang did not pay much attention to Li Jin's appearance; comparing looks was the least of her concerns./n/nLi Jin recognized Zhu Lian almost immediately after seeing him draped in a thin veil. There was no mistaking it; Zhu Lian was far too familiar with the place. Within moments, he had picked up the few books on the shelf that were related to the world of seduction—books he had often admired but had never dared to purchase. Today, however, he seemed to be in a lavish mood, exuding an air of “I’m a scholar, and even just glancing at the price of a book is an affront to the sages.” It appeared that Zhu Lian had made quite a fortune on his recent excursion.

Li Jin glanced at the “young lady” beside him. As the Water God of the river trade, he could sense something amiss, though he couldn’t pinpoint the exact nature of her realm. No matter; this was already an answer in itself—was she perhaps at the Nascent Soul stage? Ah, yes, the Xu family in Qingfeng City had a well-known fox kingdom, famous for its fox-fur beauties that were exported across the continent. What a fascinating little enchantress! Had she fallen into Zhu Lian’s trap? Was Falling Cliff Mountain planning to completely sever ties with Qingfeng City? Zhu Lian was indeed a pivotal figure in Falling Cliff Mountain; even in the absence of the young mountain lord, he could make such decisive moves.

Li Jin’s mind was abuzz with speculations, yet he pretended not to recognize Zhu Lian. He returned to sipping his tea and reading, content to let the shopkeeper do the talking—buy if you wish, but if you want to bargain, then you can leave.

Perhaps the true wise person was someone like Li Jin, who saw through the facade but chose to keep silent, playing the fool.

Whether born as fortunate humans or as rare spirits that had finally learned to speak, they all had to learn the wisdom of silence in this world.

Zhu Lian snapped his fingers, and Pei Xiang immediately produced a small inkstone, engraved with the words “Mountain Lord.”

Then, Zhu Lian inscribed a series of characters and a seal in small seal script. 

“May stone endure ten thousand years, paper a thousand, human lives a hundred, but sincere hearts only a few.”

Zhu Lian’s personal seal bore the inscription “Silent Marquis.”

He took the inkstone and, having been fully briefed by Pei Xiang about how to unlock its spatial restrictions, felt confident. 

She also possessed another treasured item, a rare keepsake from the fox kingdom, considered her secret stash. Yet, Zhu Lian had no interest in it.

When a woman reveals her heart to a man, he should bear some responsibility if he has any decency. 

But Zhu Lian was precisely the kind of person who feared such obligations.

So, he felt no romantic inclinations towards this fox kingdom’s ruler.

Zhu Lian retrieved two meticulously painted scrolls and spread one of them on the counter. He turned to the Water God with a smile. “Shopkeeper, care to take a look?”

Li Jin rose at this, placing his teapot and books aside. The tea table already sported an exquisite bronze vase adorned with cloud and dragon motifs, its details rendered beautifully. 

Inside the bronze vase, a few branches of peach blossoms were arranged. 

Li Jin approached the counter with a knowing smile. “Dear guest, I’d rather not be mundane and buy this with money. How about we trade a book for a painting?”

Pei Xiang was seeing this painting for the first time, likely having seen it in a spice shop in Qingfeng City, casually crafted by “Manager Yan” during his leisure time.

She glanced at Zhu Lian.

Her bright eyes sparkled, filled with curiosity. 

Zhu Lian remained noncommittal to Li Jin’s suggestion and opened the second scroll.

The first scroll depicted a scholar riding a large carp, the fish barely showing its head and tail, while its massive body was enveloped in swirling clouds.

Zhu Lian had sealed it with small characters reading, “My heart is profound, a realm of Daming.” 

The other scroll was titled “Dragon Gate Overlooking the Rapid Stream,” featuring the scholar propping himself against a grand pillar of Dragon Gate, with characters stating, “Fish and dragon transform, out of this world.”

Li Jin’s smile grew wider. “Zhu Lian, my old friend, this is a masterful work.”

Zhu Lian nodded with a smile. “Li Jin, brother, you have a keen eye.”

Li Jin did not linger on the paintings for long and leaned against the counter. “Let’s get to the point—what’s the price? A good omen is worth its weight in gold. Just say the word, and I’ll negotiate.” 

Using the name Li Jin, he was truly the “Golden Carp.”

Zhu Lian patted Pei Xiang’s hand, signaling her to roll up the scroll carefully and tie it securely.

With a cheerful grin, Zhu Lian said, “We’ve done business for a long time, so today let’s trade a painting for a book, how does that sound?”

Li Jin glanced at the two scrolls, withdrew his gaze, and shook his head with a smile. “Let’s stick to the old rules; it’s best to keep things clear among close friends.”

Zhu Lian laughed heartily. “Then consider this a gift for my brother Li Jin!”

Only then did Li Jin nod, placing his hand on the scroll. “Thank you. From now on, your shop will offer a special discount of twenty percent on books for you, Zhu Lian.”

Pei Xiang, sharp as ever, immediately understood the deeper implications of their exchange.

Zhu Lian, acting as the chief steward, hoped to foster closer ties between Falling Cliff Mountain and the Water God of Chongdan River, mutual benefit through friendship.

However, Li Jin, in his role as the Water God, politely declined Zhu Lian’s proposal for an alliance.

Zhu Lian took a step back, and the two maintained their brotherly friendship, enjoying each other’s company without any ulterior motives.

It was a pleasant gathering, and they parted amicably.

Zhu Lian took Pei Xiang to Qidun Mountain, which lay adjacent to the scenic Red Candle Town.

While walking, Zhu Lian picked up a branch as a makeshift walking stick, resembling an old man more and more.

Pei Xiang casually asked, “If it weren’t for the ink outline, wouldn’t it be more fitting to paint that carp in a bright red color?”

Zhu Lian shook his head. “To put it this way, I know Pei Xiang is a fox spirit, but would it be appropriate to call you a ‘fox seductress’ right in front of you? Certainly not. If all goes well, Li Jin will add color to the painting himself—no need for anyone else to do it.”

Zhu Lian smiled and said, “Don’t believe me? Let’s make a bet. A small wager, a snowflake coin.”

Pei Xiang, uninterested in gambling, thought it pointless to wager on an outcome.

As they walked, not only Pei Xiang, as a Nascent Soul fox spirit, but all the earthly immortals of Baoping Continent could see the majestic golden lotus that covered the continent.

Baoping Continent resembled a treasure vase, blossoming a single lotus flower.

Swaying gently in the spring breeze.

Such a spectacle was astonishing, even for Pei Xiang.

However, as time passed, it became less surprising to her, merely a rare beauty of the human world to admire.

On this journey home, Zhu Lian rarely took the time to appreciate the breathtaking scenery around him.

He simply inquired about the Flower God Temple and its officer, whether he truly managed the fragrance of flowers.

Pei Xiang dismissed the matter, seeing him merely as a martial arts master. 

Zhu Lian was reluctant to share any deeper insights, knowing that a pleasant gathering does not guarantee a pleasant farewell. Whether it ends well or poorly is not solely his concern; human hearts are as fragile as shattered glass.

Unless the young master is at the mountain top.

Zhu Lian chose a secluded path on Qidun Mountain, remembering how Pei Qian and Zhou Milu often took this route when waiting for the young master. He believed that during that time, Pei Qian had frequently practiced her crazy sword techniques here.

Years away from home had brought significant changes.

For instance, he learned in Red Candle Town that a new mountain god temple had been established at Qidun Mountain, while Falling Cliff Mountain had lost one mountain god in return.

The mountain god temple on Falling Cliff Mountain had been relocated to Qidun Mountain, maintaining its rank, appearing to be an official transfer, but it was essentially a demotion.

Without a plaque or deity statue, the structure remained intact.

This move indicated a tacit understanding between Mountain Lord Wei Ban and the Great Li Dynasty.

Mountain God Song Yuzhang showed no resentment, as if he had anticipated this day. 

In fact, before the relocation, he had taken his first stroll outside the temple, which had long been devoid of incense offerings, exploring Falling Cliff Mountain. He seemed to embrace a sense of lightness, as if he had shed all burdens.

Zhu Lian could empathize with Song Yuzhang. But since each served their own master, there was no need for friendship. Yet, Zhu Lian never hindered Pei Qian and the others from visiting the mountain-top temple.

Aside from the matter of the mountain god temple, Zhu Lian received congratulations from Li Jin, the Water God of Chongdan River.

The great python from Huang Lake had actually dared to leave the mountain and enter the river. Since Li Jin offered his congratulations, it was clear that the woman in the yellow robe had successfully traversed the waters.

Li Jin had been cautious, only whispering this matter to Zhu Lian in the bookstore.

Meanwhile, Pei Xiang, as a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator, could still sense things from afar, even from the borders of Longzhou. She quickly soared to a high point, gazing at the dramatic changes in the river trade of Longzhou, asserting that a great creature was indeed moving through the water.

Feeling the journey was dull, Zhu Lian decided to share this information with Pei Xiang, providing her with a clearer picture than her wild guesses about the water dragon’s origins. Pei Xiang, soaring in the skies, had utilized her ability to observe the mountains and rivers. Even though the confluence of three rivers was teeming with energy and spirits employing illusion techniques obscured her vision, she determined that the impressive creature moving through the water must be a revered guardian of Longquan Sword Sect, otherwise, how could it navigate the waters so smoothly? The floods were raging, yet it seemed as if local water gods were aiding in its passage to avoid flooding the shores and harming the people.

For ordinary scholars on the ground, the torrential rains in the expansive territory of Longzhou merely made the daytime appear dark as night, with rivers surging violently.

But for the cultivators on the mountain, it was a grand spectacle of a water dragon transformation.

Since Pei Xiang had already mentioned it and they were nearing home, Zhu Lian no longer concealed the truth. “Her name is Hongxia; she has been cultivating on a subordinate mountain of Falling Cliff for quite some time now, so she’s practically family to you. Since you are both women, if you get along, you can visit each other often. Falling Cliff Mountain has no taboos about small mountains; everything is laid bare on the table—there are simply distinctions in closeness.”

After all, the mountain rules were few, and even Milu could recite them fluently.

Pei Xiang was slightly taken aback and complained, “You didn’t think to mention such a significant ally beforehand?”

A Nascent Soul water dragon! 

She could easily be regarded as a half-Yu Pu realm Qi practitioner! 

This powerful water dragon, born with a resilient body and innate abilities, who among the Nascent Soul cultivators, aside from sword cultivators, would dare to provoke her?! Especially those celestial sects near large rivers; if enmity arose, it would be like receiving an invitation from the King of Hell—accepting would lead to death, refusing might lead to the same outcome.

If Xu Hun of Qingfeng City hadn’t already ascended to the fifth realm and was a formidable warrior renowned across the continent, Falling Cliff Mountain, with just this water dragon as their support and Zhu Lian, could have gone head-to-head with Qingfeng City.

“Hongxia can ease Pei Xiang’s worries a bit, at least.” 

Zhu Lian smiled, merely mentioning it to Pei Xiang without elaborating further.

Coincidentally, back home, Hongxia wouldn’t even dare to speak a word at Falling Cliff Mountain.

If Zhu Lian remembered correctly, Hongxia hadn’t even seen the Hall of Ancestors on Jisefeng.

What worried Zhu Lian the most was actually Chen Lingjun wandering in the North Julu Continent.

Since no definite news had reached Baoping Continent yet, it meant that Chen Lingjun had not yet crossed the waters.

He didn’t care too much about the exaggerated outcome of Chen Lingjun’s journey compared to Hongxia; he was merely concerned that Chen Lingjun’s impulsive nature could lead to trouble while traveling alone. With her temperament, things wouldn’t be too bad back home, as she had already accepted her fate and would never cling to pride again, calling it “a matter of grievances in the world.” But out in the world, she would likely try to save face again.

Pei Xiang was in a good mood as she plucked a flower from a tree and handed it to Zhu Lian.

Zhu Lian waved his hand, chuckling, “The uglier the person, the more they love flowers. You keep it.”

In the past, it was customary for men to adorn themselves with flowers in the Lotus Flower blessed land. Otherwise, the practice would have faded with only the flower-adorned Zhou Shi remaining.

Pei Xiang shot him a glare but still pinned the flower in her hair.

Zhu Lian could fly with the wind, and Pei Xiang, being a Nascent Soul Earth Immortal, followed suit, paying no mind to the road beneath them. Zhu Lian led them to a secluded ridge on Qidun Mountain, already a distance away from the mountain temple where Song Yuzhang resided.

With his hands clasped behind him, Zhu Lian stood atop an ancient pine tree, a knowing smile gracing his lips.

He could see Falling Cliff Mountain.

Pei Xiang sat on a branch, gently holding the flower to her temple.

Zhu Lian sighed, “Which family dares hang a placard of ‘No Trouble’? As long as there’s tofu and vegetables in peace, one can eat and wear warmly, sleep soundly today, and rise easily tomorrow. That is peace in our mundane world.”

Pei Xiang teased, “It’s not that I’m boasting, but how can we consider ourselves mundane scholars?”

Zhu Lian looked up at the sky and murmured, “Even if only one is beneath another, everyone else is still mundane.”

In Zhu Lian’s old hometown, even if the younger Ding Ying had a slightly higher martial arts realm, in terms of mindset, it was another matter entirely. Ding Ying was born of a moment, rising with the tide; whether his fist techniques were good or not, in Zhu Lian’s eyes, they were mere trifles.

According to Pei Qian’s later accounts, Ding Ying couldn’t even compare to what Zhu Lian had achieved back in the day. Moreover, the path that the later demon Ding Ying took was essentially the one paved by the martial arts-obsessed Zhu Lian.

That high immortal crown was something Zhu Lian had casually tossed to the young Ding Ying.

Zhu Lian single-handedly defeated nine opponents, annihilating the world’s elite, none around him to contest.

Yet, he didn’t see it as any grand feat; he felt far from what he truly desired.

For instance, the elder of Falling Cliff Mountain had already reached the heights of Zhu Lian’s heart. Zhu Lian had to step forward, one step at a time, to see it clearly.

One of the three portraits hanging at Falling Cliff Mountain depicted the martial artist Cui Cheng.

And it was that same person who had brought the mad old man, who had been crazy for over a century, to Falling Cliff Mountain, stemming from that wandering monk who eventually blossomed with each step.

Pei Xiang pointed and asked, “Is that Falling Cliff Mountain?”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Water surrounds the mountains, and mountains encircle the water. Among them, the most majestic and profound is my home.”

Pei Xiang joked, “How sentimental! Are you good at making sour fish soup?”

After all, Zhu Lian had once joked, proclaiming himself the best chef, claiming his fist techniques were decent and his skills in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting were passable.

Zhu Lian laughed heartily. “Pei Xiang, you mentioned this, so let me remind you—at Falling Cliff Mountain, aside from the young master, no one should discuss sour fish soup, or it might get recorded in the accounts.”

Under the splendid starry night, the two resumed their journey along the path of Qidun Mountain. Zhu Lian moved slowly, practicing his stances, while Pei Xiang, with nothing to do, gazed at the scenery.

They finally reached the last high slope of Qidun Mountain, where Zhu Lian stopped, looking into the distance, feeling suddenly contemplative. “Awakening from a dream is like jumping off a cliff.”

Pei Xiang asked with a smile, “Why’s that?”

Zhu Lian shook his head. “No answer.”

Pei Xiang didn’t ponder this remark deeply.

Zhu Lian’s occasional words were often peculiar, leaving others puzzled.

She couldn’t help but recall the water dragon now sharing her realm. “That great python’s journey is remarkable. Is it because your Longzhou has a good name?”

Zhu Lian replied, “No matter how good the name Longzhou is, it pales in comparison to my young master’s name.”

Pei Xiang raised a finger, gently rubbing her forehead, feeling a headache coming on.

Zhu Lian, oh Zhu Lian, if you keep this up, I might start to suspect something.

Zhu Lian muttered to himself, “The dog looked at him, he looked at me, I looked at the heavens—could this really be? I’m becoming increasingly uncertain.”

Quickly, he added, “Just a fool’s musing, Pei Xiang need not mind.”

Pei Xiang asked, “If I ask you and you answer, wouldn’t that be a confirmation of your truth?”

Zhu Lian shook his head, expressing his feelings. “How could I know whether you’re true or not? Asking is pointless, and answering is just the same.”

Pei Xiang felt a flicker of annoyance.

Yet, she also felt a sense of relief; Zhu Lian’s candidness showed he no longer regarded her as an outsider.

Pei Xiang inquired, “Then who can provide you with an answer?”

Zhu Lian raised a hand to the heavens and pointed into the distance, finally clapping his hands gently. “The sun and moon in the sky, the word ‘brightness.’ My heart shines bright, a good person. If this person tells me the answer, I shall believe.”

Zhu Lian shook his sleeves and self-deprecatingly said, “Don’t worry; I seldom feel this way; it’s merely the nerves of returning home.”

Pei Xiang felt a bit flustered.

Perhaps a person who thinks this way is quite curious and very lonely.

Zhu Lian had already collected his thoughts and continued on the path.

Once, he traveled alone across his homeland, donning a starry robe. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 839: Jia Sheng Disappoints (Part 2)**

Under the night sky, Ruan Xiu stood by the banks of the Jade Liquid River. 

In this temporary spot for recuperation and stabilizing her cultivation, Hong Xia immediately activated her divine powers, hastily surfacing and landing to meet Ruan Xiu. 

Before her transformation into a water serpent, Hong Xia had been trembling with fear in front of Ruan Xiu. After her successful transformation, however, she was even more lost in thought, unable to control herself. 

Thus, the initial joy that had bubbled up in her heart upon successfully transforming into a serpent had at least halved. 

The water goddess of the Jade Liquid River hesitated, her demeanor timid. Moments after Hong Xia appeared, she too came to pay her respects to Ruan Xiu. 

Ruan Xiu glanced at the two of them—one a transformed water serpent, the other a formally recognized water goddess. She said nothing, simply nibbling on a piece of sweet peach blossom cake. 

The section of the Jade Liquid River had long been cleared of all river officials and water spirits by the water goddess, fearful of inadvertently offending the young woman with the ponytail standing before her. 

Previously, having received Ruan Xiu's "imperial edict," the woman in yellow had anxiously chosen a water source during the torrential rain that night, revealing her true form and beginning her journey through the waters. 

At present, the only three places in Longzhou that could be considered as celestial mountains were Longquan Sword Sect, Piyun Mountain, and Luopoc Mountain. 

Therefore, this journey through the water had gone so smoothly that the woman in yellow, now known as Hong Xia, felt as if she were dreaming. 

First, she emerged from a source stream, where the river goddess of Longxu River, the Horse Orchid, had no temple or incense offerings to honor her. The river goddess had only dared to flatter her as she helped contain the floods. Then, she passed through the Iron Talisman River, where the first-rate river deity of Great Li, Yang Hua, was stationed. Though she did not reveal herself, she still suppressed the water's momentum. After that, she traversed a short stretch of the Embroidered River, and finally, she went upstream against the treacherous and wild Chongdan River, where both river deities acted like guardians, ensuring Hong Xia's safe passage. 

Ultimately, she could reach a natural water cave rich in spiritual energy along the Jade Liquid River to heal her injuries. 

It was the water goddess herself who personally invited the "Daoist Hong Xia." 

The water goddess of the Jade Liquid River truly envied the opportunities this great serpent had. 

Conversely, she felt that, far from attaining any great fortune or blessings, she seemed to only attract calamities and misfortunes. 

The woman in green remained silent, and both Hong Xia and the water goddess fell silent as well. 

Ruan Xiu, eating her cake, glanced at Hong Xia and remarked, “Not a pretty sight. No wonder you lost to a little loach.” 

Hong Xia cautiously stole a glance at Ruan Xiu's wrist, where a fire dragon coiled like a bracelet. 

What had once been a lifeless fire dragon now moved its eyes skillfully, locking onto Hong Xia. 

Hong Xia's heart jolted, and she quickly averted her gaze, struggling to steady her mind and prevent herself from instinctively taking a step back. 

The fire dragon was at least at the upper fifth realm—definitely at the upper fifth realm! 

Ruan Xiu seemed unaware that her leisurely consumption of the cake was a great torment for the two individuals before her, like fish frying in a hot pan, subjected to intense heat. 

Even if she realized it, she likely wouldn’t care. 

Ruan Xiu had just returned to the Haoran World, aided by a middle-aged scholar who had opened the door for her. 

Fearing her father would scold her for her recklessness, she came here to hide for a while. 

In a bad mood, she naturally couldn’t muster a pleasant expression for Hong Xia. 

Ruan Xiu gently shook her wrist, the fire dragon that had emerged in the outer heavens was exceptionally docile towards its master, continuing to slumber peacefully. 

The most ordinary mountain and marsh water spirits could count themselves fortunate for successfully navigating a great river, and with a good lineage, they might just gain some auspicious trait of the water dragons, such as dragon claws, scales, or whiskers. 

Just like the great demon of the yellow eel from Tongye Island, who had attempted to navigate the waters and become a dragon. Had it not been for the water goddess's numerous interventions, it would have already transformed into a dragon long ago. 

As for the water spirits that were originally of dragon lineage, they needed to traverse at least one great river to be recognized by the heavenly principles. This would not only grant them the true form of a dragon but also allow them to nurture a dragon pearl of their own. 

However, three thousand years ago, that calamity that had befallen all water spirits was seen as the end of true dragons, leaving only many illegitimate dragon descendants. 

With the great floods of the Haoran World being so sparse, there were only a few rivers, often densely populated with sects. Who would dare to act recklessly? Not to mention traversing tens of thousands of miles, even hiding in a secluded spot at the river bottom, seeking a place with rich water flow to make a nest, simply hanging a plaque of some dragon palace or water mansion would be considered a great fortune. 

Thus, successful navigation and dragon transformation of a great serpent had not occurred in three thousand years. 

All water dragons and countless water spirits wished to transform into dragons, but who dared to? 

Because no one could assure whether that nameless sword immortal who had annihilated true dragons would strike again. 

Until there was a dragon with pure white scales in Baoping Island that navigated through a great flood, truly returning to its dragon form. 

This little serpent, Hong Xia, was leagues away from that little loach from Niping Alley. Even the small creature that followed behind Zhi Gui during its navigation was still inferior. 

Ruan Xiu lifted her chin towards the surface of the Jade Liquid River and said, “You may all leave.” 

Both the water serpent and the water goddess felt like they had received a pardon. 

They immediately submerged into the water, exchanging a distant glance at the riverbed, both too timid to communicate with their thoughts, each feeling a sense of shared suffering. 

Ruan Xiu frowned, still gazing at the flowing river, and asked, “Is it beautiful?” 

An old boatman leisurely paddled down the river. 

Even from over ten miles away, Ruan Xiu's voice was clear to him. He made no reply, simply exclaiming in wonder. 

A young woman in a Daoist robe stood at the bow of the boat, looking at Ruan Xiu with a smile, “Miss Ruan, we meet again.” 

Ruan Xiu had previously thought well of He Xiaoliang, who had traveled through the Lihuzhou Cave as a Daoist disciple of the Divine Decree Sect, but now she felt less inclined to be friendly. 

The leader of the Qingliang Sect from Beiju Lu Island, He Xiaoliang. 

Next to her was a deer-riding goddess who had emerged from the mural city of the Skeleton Beach. 

She had received instructions to stand behind her master, He Xiaoliang, because earlier, just a glance at the woman in green had left her feeling uneasy. 

Not long ago, He Xiaoliang and the old boatman, who was half her senior, had received an exceptionally cryptic instruction from their master. 

There were only two tasks: one concerned Chen Lingjun, which had already been dealt with, and the other was for He Xiaoliang to return to Baoping Island to seek out the young loach from Niping Alley and the Ma Ku Xuan from Xinghua Alley. He Xiaoliang could also conveniently meet a certain senior brother. 

As for the old boatman, compared to that junior brother, he was more eager to visit Old Lady Gui in the Old Dragon City. 

Li Xisheng crossed the Middle Land Divine Continent, arriving outside the main gate of the Fulu Street in his hometown. 

After greeting his parents, he went to the small pond where his younger sister resided. 

Looking at a small golden crab inside, he smiled, “Don't say you're not afraid of thunder and lightning, even the Dragon King of the Sea can roam freely.” 

Zhu Lian and Pei Xiang walked out of the Chess Stone Mountain, still taking their time to return. Near the entrance at the foot of Luopoc Mountain, Pei Xiang spotted a little girl in black, arms crossed, clutching a green bamboo staff and a golden shoulder pole, standing straight and wide-eyed, as if she were a little water spirit guarding the mountain gate. 

Pei Xiang couldn’t help but chuckle, “You really are...” 

Unsure of how to describe the mountain winds of Luopoc Mountain. 

Zhu Lian introduced, “She is our right protector here at Luopoc Mountain.” 

Pei Xiang laughed out loud. 

Zhu Lian added, “I’m not lying to you; Xiao Mi Li is indeed listed as our right protector in the Luopoc Mountain genealogy, sitting very close to the master’s hall on Jise Peak.” 

Pei Xiang remained skeptical, “Is that true?!” 

Zhu Lian chuckled, “By the way, when you meet Xiao Mi Li later, feel free to greet her outright with, ‘You are the legendary big water spirit of the Mute Lake,’ and she’ll be very happy.” 

He wiped away the mask on his face, returning to his usual appearance as the old cook of Luopoc Mountain. 

Pei Xiang also removed her mask, dispelling her illusion. 

Zhou Mi Li rubbed her eyes and then dashed over to Zhu Lian, her voice choked with tears, “Old Cook! I thought you were lost and didn’t know how to get home! I didn’t dare to go to Hongzhu Town to pick you up…” 

The little girl was so distressed she could hardly speak. 

She didn’t care about any semblance of pride, accidentally admitting that she was afraid to go to Hongzhu Town and the Jade Liquid River. 

Zhu Lian reached out to ruffle Xiao Mi Li's hair, shaking the large package on his back, and smiled, “Guess what’s inside.” 

Xiao Mi Li wiped away her tears, cautiously glanced at the woman next to the old cook, pursed her lips tightly, and offered a respectful bow to Pei Xiang. 

Pei Xiang nodded with a smile. 

Just now, she had been so focused on whether the old cook was fatter or thinner that she hadn’t noticed how exceptionally beautiful this sister was. 

Pei Xiang recalled Zhu Lian's reminder and smiled, “You are the big water spirit of Mute Lake?” 

Zhou Mi Li froze on the spot, unsure whether to scratch her face or her head. 

Oh? 

This sister suddenly looked even more beautiful. 

Perhaps this is what Pei Qian meant by “girls become more beautiful as they grow up”? 

Sigh, what’s so good about growing up? But Xiao Mi Li wouldn’t dare to say this to Pei Qian. 

Zhou Mi Li recalled the old cook’s question and whispered, “Is it that kind of immortal book Pei Qian mentioned? With pictures of little figures that can fight? It's a pity Pei Qian doesn’t want to say more. Can I take a look? I love reading now; I’m learning a lot. Hehe, when Pei Qian comes back home, she’ll be in for a big surprise.” 

Zhu Lian's face flushed with embarrassment, and he helplessly replied, “It’s just sunflower seeds.” 

Zhou Mi Li sighed dramatically, sounding wise beyond her years, “You’re already grown up, and you’re still munching seeds?” 

However, the little girl quickly smiled, “Well, I bought them, so let’s just go with it!” 

Zhu Lian nodded with a smile. 

The long-lost winds of home finally felt more than just a distant memory. 

I have returned home, here amidst these mountains. 

A little water spirit seemed to transform into a small yellow oriole, flitting around Zhu Lian, chattering about family matters. 

There were some things she couldn't mention, so Xiao Mi Li kept them to herself. Among the clever spirits of Luopoc Mountain, Pei Qian ranked first, and she was second; even Sister Warm Tree could only come in third! 

Pei Xiang found it utterly absurd and couldn’t help but inquire with her mind—was that little water spirit really the right protector of Luopoc Mountain? 

The protective positions for the sects and celestial caves among the mountain homes carried immense weight, recognized as half of the mountain water formation by the genealogical celestial masters. 

Pei Xiang was certain this little water spirit’s realm was not just low; it was quite absurdly low. If this little girl was already a right protector, could it be that Hong Xia was the left protector? Or perhaps the chief offering of Luopoc Mountain? 

But Zhu Lian, utterly indifferent, continued to engage in trivial talk with the little girl. 

Pei Xiang found herself both amused and frustrated. 

No wonder you’re called the old cook. 

Just as Pei Xiang felt a hint of gloom, it quickly turned to horror. 

A handsome young man in white appeared out of nowhere, smiling at Zhu Lian, “You’re really getting into the swing of things, aren’t you? How many years has it been?” 

Pei Xiang thought this person was as handsome as a jade mountain. 

In her eyes, he was only slightly less attractive than Zhu Lian. 

The Mountain Lord Wei Bo! 

Within the northern land of the continent, he was the foremost deity respected by all. 

Zhu Lian sighed, “It’s been so long since I’ve been back home; I really miss you, Wei brother.” 

Wei Bo smirked, “Oh, spare me.” 

You reap what you sow; Zhu Lian immediately rubbed his hands together, “The Mountain Lord’s abilities have skyrocketed; we should all celebrate together. Once the chaos is over, let’s have a night banquet in good order!” 

Wei Bo ignored Zhu Lian, simply nodding at the ruler of the Fox Kingdom. 

He could roughly guess Zhu Lian’s schemes. Quite the rascal. With this one move, Zhu Lian had effectively cut off half of the Xu family’s income in Qingfeng City. 

Pei Xiang hurriedly offered her respects to the Mountain Lord. 

Graceful and charming, it wasn’t that she intended to be so. 

Little Mi Li joyfully shouted, “Mountain Lord Wei! Mountain Lord Wei! Mountain Lord Wei!” Usually, she would only call out twice, but today, she was especially happy, so she shouted an extra time. 

Wei Bo understood, slightly bent down and opened his palm. 

Little Mi Li dropped a large handful of sunflower seeds. 

Wei Bo thanked her, naturally munching on the seeds while communicating serious matters with Zhu Lian through thought. 

Pei Xiang watched, her eyelids twitching. 

When Zhu Lian heard what Wei Bo had to say, he scoffed, “That little brat saved his own life.” 

The remnant of the Zhu Ying Dynasty that had come to seek refuge at Luopoc Mountain had also received a secret decree from the Great Li. However, he had not gone to the Ascension Platform, and the young sword cultivator had effectively forfeited an enormous opportunity. 

This was undoubtedly a sign from Emperor Song of the Great Li to Luopoc Mountain. We are aware of this person's origins, yet are still willing to let bygones be bygones. The pursuit by the Ministry of Justice will cease. 

Zhu Lian was quite satisfied with that stray dog’s decision, which was indeed wise. Having been granted a place to take refuge at Luopoc Mountain, one should be content. If he were to take advantage of Luopoc Mountain and mistakenly believe that a one-time life-saving talisman could serve as a permanent shield, then Zhu Lian would surely stick a death talisman on his corpse. 

Otherwise, once he returned to Luopoc Mountain, Zhu Lian’s second order of business would definitely be to question him. 

And when Zhu Lian questioned someone, it was a matter of life and death. 

As for the first order of business, it was, of course, to send sunflower seeds to Nuanshu and Mi Li, and then prepare a grand feast of seasonal mountain delicacies. After that, he would take off his apron and go question him. 

Zhu Lian raised his head. 

Then Pei Xiang saw a young man in a blue robe slowly walking down from the mountain, his smile gentle. 

Zhu Lian froze for a moment. 

He cast a glance at Wei Bo. 

Wei Bo intentionally kept quiet about this person; after all, Zhu Lian had returned home, so he might as well go see for himself. 

Having secretly plotted in Qingfeng City for all these years, Zhu Lian had refrained from any correspondence with Luopoc Mountain, just in case he lost everything at the last moment. 

After all, that Xu family woman was no easy opponent. For instance, regarding the matter of quietly gathering literary talent through the Fox Kingdom, Zhu Lian had already noticed traces of it, yet Pei Xiang still hadn’t confided in him. 

So Zhu Lian truly didn’t know this person’s identity. 

He could only tell that the other person was a sword cultivator of no low realm. 

Mi Yu communicated with Zhu Lian through thought, “I’ve met the steward. I come from the Sword Qi Great Wall, Mi Yu, with ‘Mi’ as in rice and ‘Yu’ as in wealth, a Sword Cultivator at the Jade Purity Realm. At Luopoc Mountain, Brother Zhu calls me Yu Mi.” 

Zhu Lian clasped his fists with a smile, “Brother Yu, you’re quite gallant, adding much color to Luopoc Mountain.” 

Yu Mi quickly returned the gesture, saying, “I dare not claim such praise.” 

Wei Bo smiled, amused. 

Zhou Mi Li winked at Yu Mi, then subtly leaned backward, glancing at the package on the old cook's back, signaling Yu Mi that the old cook had bought a large quantity of sunflower seeds today. 

Pei Xiang felt somewhat out of place and was shocked by the “Brother Yu.” 

The aura of sword qi was overwhelming! 

Of course, it wasn’t that Yu Mi was trying to show off his realm. 

Such things were far too trivial. 

In reality, Yu Mi had just returned from the Old Dragon City not long ago, and the residual killing intent mixed with sword qi had yet to dissipate. 

He was merely revealing his aura naturally. 

This was still the result of Yu Mi deliberately suppressing the sword intent. 

Besides Yu Mi and Zhu Lian returning to Luopoc Mountain, there were others who were on their way. 

Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang had finally returned from their long journey to Baoping Island, traveling from the north via the intercontinental ferry of the Pi Ma Sect. 

Returning directly from the Middle Land Divine Continent to Baoping Island was not feasible without an intercontinental ferry, and the journey was too treacherous. 

Master Zhong had taken Cao Qinglang on a detour through the White Frost Continent, heading to Beiju Lu Island, and then took the ferry south to return home. 

Another group included Sui Jingcheng and his senior brother Rong Chang from the Floating Duck Sword Lake, who were traveling back from the southern part of Baoping Island and would pass by Luopoc Mountain again. 

During their journey, they specifically ran to the Old Dragon City to find their master, Li Cai. Li Cai had not allowed his senior disciple, Rong Chang, to remain on the battlefield, stating that if she were to die, the Floating Duck Sword Lake would be bullied half to death. Thus, Rong Chang should not join the fray; anyway, the Floating Duck Sword Lake had its sect master to support them, and it was not worth bragging about; they certainly wouldn’t be humiliated. 

At this moment on the mountain, outside the bamboo tower, the sword cultivator Cui Wei, who was training at the Sword Offering Platform, was preparing to descend. 

He was going to bid farewell to his sword immortal senior brother Yu Mi and also see the one practicing talismans, Jiang Qiu. 

Cui Wei had also visited the Ascension Platform. 

He was already a Yuan Ying sword cultivator. 

Now, Wei Bo, the Mountain Lord of the North, was relatively free not because he was slacking off but because, during those recent battles after the celestial doors opened, he hadn’t needed to lift a finger, simply reaping the benefits. It was likely that upon reuniting with the Zhongyue Mountain Lord Jin Qing, the latter would have quite a few words to say. 

Zhu Lian gathered Wei Bo, Yu Mi, and the accountant Wei Wenlong together to discuss serious matters. 

There were far too many things to discuss, and not a single one was trivial. 

Even the arrangement of the Fox Kingdom was not the most important matter. 

Pei Xiang followed the little girl in a pink skirt named Chen Nuanshu, together with that strange little Mi Li, to settle into a quiet courtyard. 

Pei Xiang felt complicated emotions, unable to sleep at night, so she decided to leave her residence for a walk and sat on the steps at the mountain peak. 

She felt that her current mood was overly unreasonable. 

Before reaching Luopoc Mountain, she was afraid the family’s foundation was too thin, but after arriving, strange events unfolded one after another, leaving her dazzled and inevitably anxious. 

Then Pei Xiang noticed that Zhu Lian seemed to have finished discussing things and was currently accompanying Cen Yuanki down the mountain. 

Zhu Lian discovered that Cen Yuanki had made significant progress in her fist techniques, having learned from Liu Shiliu’s guidance. 

Zhu Lian urged Cen Yuanki to continue her training on the platform while he hurried ahead to sit next to Pei Xiang. 

Zhu Lian spoke softly, “Are you just realizing that you’ve found yourself in a foreign land? It’s all right; you’ll get used to it soon.” 

Pei Xiang quietly asked, “Yan Fang, have you been secretly mocking me in your heart as a frog in a well?” 

Zhu Lian laughed, “How did you become so sentimental? In my impression, the ruler of the Fox Kingdom in Qingfeng City is a heroic woman—clever and decisive, and quite beautiful.” 

Pei Xiang sighed, “I wish I had never met you.” 

Some women’s emotions are genuinely irrational. 

When their mood is good, everything is fine. When their mood is poor, everything is bad. 

The latter often comes suddenly, catching men off guard. 

So don’t listen to her specifics; whether they’re fragmented grievances or inexplicable angry remarks, don’t be anxious or throw yourself into chaos; just consider it an unarguable truth and listen well. 

Once you become impatient or try to reason with her, what can be done? It’s all ruined. Even if you don’t speak, you must listen carefully and pay attention to her. 

Whether a man is willing to do this often reflects the true knot in a woman’s heart. 

However, who Zhu Lian was quickly caused Pei Xiang to smile. 

Cen Yuanki had stopped halfway down the mountain, collecting her fists. Upon seeing the warm scene on the steps, she admired Zhu Lian even more. Just returning home, he was already caring for guests at Luopoc Mountain. 

If the young mountain lord were sitting beside that woman, Cen Yuanki would likely worry about Pei Xiang's situation. 

What if it was that mountain lord? With improper eyes and a penchant for drunkenly wandering at night, he loved to ignore everything and embark on solitary journeys, leaving Zhu Lian to work tirelessly. 

Meanwhile, Cen Yuanki diligently practiced her punches every day, and no one could find fault with her. Moreover, perhaps next time they crossed paths, the gap in their fist techniques would close considerably. 

In the small town under the heavy night, Yang’s pharmacy. 

The long-lived friend left the Dragon Riding Alley and came here at night, gently knocking on the door. 

Having recently returned from a place of ancient battle to temper his martial arts, Su Dian and Shi Ling Mountain had already returned from their travels, continuing as unremarkable shop assistants. However, Shi Ling Mountain resided in Peach Leaf Alley, while only Sister Su Dian stayed here. 

Su Dian had received instructions from her master to open the door for a certain woman. 

The long-lived friend went to the backyard. 

Su Dian simply moved a stool to sit at the entrance. 

In the backyard, the long-lived friend bowed deeply to the elder. 

Performing the junior's etiquette, she didn’t even sit down. 

She inquired whether the shop needed any golden coins or copper money. 

After all, the great war was in full swing. Outside the Old Dragon City, while the battles were not as fierce as in Old Dragon City, there was still smoke and chaos everywhere along the coastal battlefront. 

Old Yang shook his head, “Your good intentions are appreciated. It’s not easy for you to accumulate that little fortune, so keep it well.” 

The reason he was willing to converse with her a bit longer wasn't just due to her sincere heart but also because of their connection with the divine way. 

The long-lived friend was about to take her leave when the elder suddenly asked, “Have you noticed the hidden thread on that Shi Rou?” 

The long-lived friend shook her head, “I have not discerned it.” 

Old Yang replaced his old smoking pipe and lightly tapped the steps before packing the tobacco, “In the ancient Shu region, there are many extraordinary people. The legacy of that Shi Rou is merely one among them. At first, it wasn’t noticeable, but as time passes, it becomes more apparent.” 

The long-lived friend found the Baoping Island intriguing; Luopoc Mountain had a rich collection of books, and she often browsed through them. She recalled seeing something mentioned in a book about the eight hundred immortals of ancient Shu. 

The elder continued revealing secrets, “She has some connection with that Bai Yu Jing’s three teaching masters, a tenuous bond. As for when it might lead to the lotus flower and the root, it depends on her mood and whether she wishes to return to her true homeland to meet her senior brother.” 

The long-lived friend listened quietly, silently noting it in her heart. 

Old Yang suddenly said, “Wild cats roam freely at night.” 

The “childhood companion” of Ma Ku Xuan surely had a far more significant background than Shi Rou's little legacy. 

Old Yang pointed to the long bench under the eaves across from him, “Sit down. Let’s chat casually.” 

The long-lived friend complied and sat down. 

Old Yang fell silent for a long while before slowly speaking, “In such a small place, there’s nothing more intimidating to outsiders.” 

For the past sixty years. 

Cui Zhan and Qi Jingchun, this pair of sworn enemies for all to see. Cui Zhan’s betrayal was true, and destroying his teacher and ancestors was one thing. 

The literary saint, the old scholar, Jun Qian, and Liu Shiliu. Along with Chen Ping’an, the lineage of the literary saint is only missing one who hasn’t appeared here yet. 

The most accomplished in the world, Bai Ye. 

The three masters of Bai Yu Jing, Lu Shen, are here to set up shop for divination, while the Yin-Yang master Zou Zi is here selling candied haws. 

The Heavenly Lord Xie Shi. 

Ruan Qiong and Ruan Xiu, Li Er and Li Liu, two pairs of father and daughter. 

Cao Xi and Cao Jun, a pair of grandfather and grandson from Niping Alley. 

“Blind Daoist Jia Sheng,” Zheng Ju Zhong of Baidi City, another pair of master and disciple. 

One of the avatars of the Daoist elder, Li Xisheng. 

In the past, there was Song Changjing of the White Dragon Fish Garment. 

Mo Jia’s Xu Ruo. 

Just a few steps away from entering the town is A Liang. 

Like the maid from Niping Alley, Zhi Gui, who steals light through the wall. 

The first upper fifth realm mountain lord of Baoping Island, Wei Bo. 

Sword cultivators Jiang Shangzhen, Yu Mi, Li Cai… 

And of course, lastly, the ancient sword hanging beneath the bridge. 

For those cultivating on the mountain, sixty short years is nothing. 

Thus, if one’s luck falters slightly, regardless of who comes here, no matter how high their realm, if they act recklessly, they will find their lives hanging by a thread. 

Even if one is momentarily successful and makes an enemy here, with their lives temporarily safe, they must look ahead and be cautious. After all, the youngsters from Lihuzhou Cave, especially this generation of Chen Ping’an and Ma Ku Xuan, have ventured far, and their futures will not be small. 

Old Yang surprisingly smiled, “What an opening, truly magnificent.” 

The long-lived friend remained breathless and focused, listening but saying nothing. 

Then she turned her gaze. 

A weary young scholar appeared, carrying a bamboo box and a green bamboo staff, suddenly lifting the curtain. Upon seeing Old Yang’s rare smile, he burst into laughter, “Old man, look at you so happy, are you silly? Did you find a wife?! Old age is getting better, that’s quite something!” 

The long-lived friend was taken aback. 

The young man, unaware of her identity, could only clasp his fists and laugh, before scampering behind Old Yang and playfully wrapping his arms around the elder’s neck, “Do you miss me? Do you miss me?!” 

He had no idea that Old Yang could find such a beautiful sister. 

The long-lived friend was momentarily stunned and then suddenly laughed. 

She realized it was the famous Li Huai, who had a good relationship with his master since childhood. 

Old Yang let Li Huai act as he pleased, only saying, “You’ve come back.” 

Li Huai loosened his grip, plopping down beside him, gently patting his legs, complaining, “This trip was a good one, but it exhausted me. No fortune whatsoever.” 

Old Yang chuckled. 

The lazy Liu Xianyang rarely visited Luopoc Mountain. 

He didn’t come often. 

His riverside blacksmith shop was not close to the mountain. 

Liu Xianyang was so lazy that he hadn’t even visited the Ascension Platform. 

After all, he had been there many times in his dreams. 

Ordinary people shouldn’t bother Liu Xianyang with anything too shocking. 

Watching the little Mi Li sitting on a small stool, resembling a chick pecking at rice while dozing off, Liu Xianyang coughed lightly. 

Mi Li jolted awake, rubbing her eyes, and immediately stood up, laughing, “Old Sleepy has arrived!” 

The nickname “Old Sleepy” had been given to Liu Xianyang by Mi Li long ago. He nodded, then sat down beside her, grinning, “Little Mi Li, as the right protector, you sure are losing face by serving as a little gatekeeper.” 

Xiao Mi Li helplessly replied, “What can I do? Uncle Big Wind has gone far away, so I’m following my sister down the mountain. Sister Nuanshu is so busy every day, and I have so much free time.” 

Then the little girl quietly added, “When Pei Qian comes back and sees me guarding the gate here, I’ll get a hefty credit on the merit book, and I can’t escape it!” 

The little girl suddenly raised a fist, “Even if they run away, I’m not afraid; I can catch them in one go! Just like… Pei Qian pressing down on the left protector of Dragon Riding Alley!” 

Liu Xianyang crossed his arms. 

Xiao Mi Li asked, “What? Are you thinking of the good-natured mountain lord?” 

Think about it, think about it; it’s just right for both of us. 

Unexpectedly, Liu Xianyang smiled and shook his head, “Forget him; thinking about him is annoying.” 

Having just taken out a handful of sunflower seeds to treat Little Sleepy, the little girl silently put them back into her sleeve. 

How can you say anything? Think about it? Then just eat it. 

Little Mi Li gently shook her head. 

Liu Xianyang held back his laughter and asked, “Previously, your good-natured mountain lord often followed me like a shadow, going to the creek’s edge, looking for a narrow water surface. I would jump first, then he would follow. Whoosh, I’d leap to the opposite bank, and then splash, he’d fall into the water. I’d laugh at him from the other side.” 

The little girl’s eyes widened as she shook her head vigorously, “Old Sleepy, you’re talking nonsense without a script. The good-natured mountain lord is amazing, amazing!” 

Except for not being able to recite poetry. 

Besides, if the good-natured mountain lord was Old Sleepy’s shadow, then what would that make her relationship with Pei Qian? Wouldn’t that lower her status? 

Liu Xianyang shrugged, laughing, “Little Mi Li, oh Little Mi Li.” 

The little girl giggled, “Old Sleepy, oh Old Sleepy.” 

Liu Xianyang gazed into the distance, looking at the bright moon, joking, “You should hurry up and find a wife, then have a daughter as cute as Little Mi Li!” 

Xiao Mi Li pondered for a moment, drawing a circle with her little head, “Generally speaking, it’s very difficult. But if I eat sunflower seeds, it’s not that hard.” 

Liu Xianyang muttered, “In the short pavilion and long pavilion, the long pavilion is even shorter. The pavilions stop and pause repeatedly, but the return path seems endless.” 

Xiao Mi Li’s eyes lit up, “Old Sleepy, you can recite poetry! Can I borrow it for a few days? I want to show off to Pei Qian later. Once I’m done showing off, I’ll definitely return it to you.” 

Liu Xianyang smiled, “Of course, you can.” 

Then, the two of them, one big and one small, looked at the round moon, each thinking of someone far away. 

**In the central region of the Golden Armor Continent.** 

Pei Qian stumbled upon a mud-streaked little child on a battlefield that ended tragically. 

This child was the last elite border soldier of a great dynasty, and in an instant, the entire force of 160,000 was wiped out. 

Upon their first encounter, the child lay on the ground, first seeing a pair of tattered boots, soaked in blood, stopping not far from the child. 

Pei Qian reached out to pull the child from the heap of dead, but the child sat there, motionless, only staring intently at a young woman covered in blood, her face cracked and cheekbones exposed. 

The child’s eyes were lifeless. 

Yuan Jianfu approached Pei Qian, casting a glance at the pitifully thin child before saying to Pei Qian, “Thank you for that punch.” 

Pei Qian forced a smile and shook her head. 

Earlier on the battlefield, she had saved Yuan Jianfu from a distance with that punch, learned from the predecessor Lei Gong Temple, so Pei Qian didn’t think there was anything worth thanking for. If her master knew, wouldn’t that be a waste of a chestnut? 

A young man dressed in white, extremely eye-catching, stood alone on a hilltop. 

In the path of cultivation, there was a Daoist known as Dao Lao Er in Qingming, recognized as truly invincible across several realms. 

On the path of martial arts, this person also possessed a certain aura of invincibility. 

After all, before him, there was a master of a martial goddess waiting for him. 

Cao Ci could not only punch to kill enemies but could also strike to save others. 

Pei Qian could at most keep an eye on the safety of her sister Xi. This was still because Yuan Jianfu was fighting alongside her and not far away. 

But that Cao Ci could extend his reach to the battlefield far away. 

No wonder he was the only rival of her master in martial arts. 

When her master sought a rival, it was always formidable, just like her master. 

Even among the disciples of the foundation, it seemed he couldn’t stand out too much. 

Pei Qian spoke to the child, “Get up. When it’s time to feign death, feign death; when it’s time to rise, rise. After rising, bow your head; that’s how one can live long. If you stay here, dead means dead.” 

Pei Qian had actually noticed this strange child long ago, but she hadn’t had the chance to care for him earlier. 

This child was of the demon clan. 

However, on this battlefield, the “child” from the Golden Armor Continent had desperately protected someone. Unfortunately, that person he fought to protect was already beyond recognition. 

The child had only recently transformed into a human form, and due to a spell, he had suffered the cost of being severed from the Bridge of Eternal Life, so he hadn’t been feigning death on purpose but had fainted, waiting until he woke up to start pretending. 

In the end, the child got up and silently followed Pei Qian, limping along. 

Pei Qian walked quickly, and he kept pace; when she slowed down, he slowed down too. 

Yuan Jianfu did not hold back, speaking straightforwardly, “Pei Qian, I’ll say one more thing. You’ll have to fight by yourself and take care of a child; it won’t be easy.” 

Yuan Jianfu bore no prejudice against the child’s demon lineage. 

Pei Qian nodded, “It’s hard.” 

She turned to glance at the child, who had momentarily stopped in his tracks. 

It seemed that after the person died, the wild aura that had surrounded the child began to gather again, making him appear more like a mountain wild spirit, not very adept at concealing the essence of his demon race. 

The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart. 

Pei Qian halted, turned to face the child, and asked in the elegant language of the Golden Armor Continent, “Do you want to learn to fight?” 

The child remained unresponsive, just standing there. 

Yuan Jianfu furrowed his brow because he saw in the child’s eyes a deep-seated hatred, directed at both himself and Pei Qian. It seemed to extend towards the entire world and its laws. 

No reason, but this was the fact. 

The child gazed at Pei Qian, and finally willing to speak, extended a hand, his voice hoarse and unclear, as if he had been wounded at the roots of the great path, making it difficult to speak. 

Yuan Jianfu strained to hear, and the child said, “Lend me money, and I’ll leave. A life-buying price, I’ll pay it back later.” 

Pei Qian replied, “You can earn money by learning to fight.” 

The child’s expression remained impassive as he lowered his head. 

Yuan Jianfu felt somewhat helpless; Pei Qian and this child were on two different wavelengths altogether. 

At the Qinghu Palace on the peak of Tianque, the veteran Yuan Ying Lu Yong harbored thoughts of death and sought out the leading martial general among the accompanying soldiers, proposing to strike a deal with the Great Li Dynasty according to the mountain rules set by the national teacher. 

The robust martial general nodded, saying they could negotiate. He then immediately summoned two young secretaries from the Great Li to discuss the details with this old Yuan Ying from afar, bringing along a secret record detailing the information about the Qinghu Palace and Lu Yong. One of the secretaries advised the martial general that Lu Yong need not fight on the battlefield to earn military merits; alchemy would suffice, as it would be even more beneficial. 

The martial general frowned and asked directly the young official about how the alchemy could be converted into military merit, given that Lu Yong was putting his life on the line here to discuss this matter, so it required a detailed explanation. 

The young secretary quickly conferred with his colleague nearby and then spoke openly, providing the martial general and Lu Yong with a clear answer face to face. 

The young official spoke rapidly, his words precise, leaving no room for ambiguity. 

For instance, all the heavenly materials and earthly treasures needed for alchemy need not come from Lu Yong and the Qinghu Palace; they only asked that the Great Li not haggle over labor costs. 

For instance, if several alchemical methods from the Qinghu Palace could indeed have an immediate effect on cultivators and pure martial artists, as long as Lu Yong was willing to reveal them to the Great Li publicly, he could earn a considerable amount of military merit. 

The martial general merely interjected, assuring Lu Yong that if he was unwilling to provide the secret alchemical formulas, the Great Li would certainly not make things difficult for the Qinghu Palace and would not pursue the matter later. 

Lu Yong was overjoyed, suppressing his excitement as he agreed to everything. 

From start to finish, it took less than half an hour. Both the young secretaries provided Lu Yong with exceedingly detailed answers about where all alchemical cultivators from the Qinghu Palace should go and how to do it, the prices of various medicines, and how the conversion into military merit would be calculated. 

Once the discussions were concluded, the two young secretaries quickly departed. 

The martial general merely clasped his fists, exchanging no formalities with them. 

Lu Yong couldn’t help but feel emotional. 

The thunderous might of the Great Li border army was not only on the battlefield. 

The Great Li martial generals responsible for watching over the foreign cultivators displayed their cold eyes whenever they donned their armor and drew their swords, occasionally casting glances at those seemingly caged celestial beings. 

To negotiate a deal with this old Yuan Ying from Qinghu Palace as a Great Li martial general was merely part of his duties. 

In the Great Li border army, laws were strict; no one had the luxury to take them lightly. 

Those various rules, large and small, were ingrained in the bones of the martial men. 

The Great Li cavalry and the accompanying cultivators shared a brotherhood without distinction between those on the mountain and those off it; they were all martial men. 

However, since the deal had been struck, there was no need for much hesitation. The man revealed a smile before departing, and as he turned to the old cultivator, he solemnly clasped his fists, saying, “For an old man like you to be willing to die in a foreign land, the Tianque Peak Qinghu Palace, both I and my comrades will remember. What a few battlefield brutes remember is of little consequence, just a heartfelt word for the old man.” 

The man strode away, the sound of his armor echoing, leaving only the old man’s silhouette behind. 

Lu Yong couldn’t help but clasp his fists towards the retreating figure before reluctantly letting go, quickly turning away to attend to his duties! 

In the distance, at the Old Dragon City battlefield. 

An old monk from a large temple fought side by side with an unknown Taoist. 

The old Taoist opened a renowned work of calligraphy, “Chushi Tie,” which contained merely twenty-eight characters, yet had over one hundred seventy-two seals in later generations. 

Each character served as a talisman, launching golden-armored puppets against the demon army. 

This was indeed a genuine Jade Purity realm cultivator, yet he remained unknown in Baoping Island. 

The martial fortunes of Baoping Island were not inferior to the other seven continents outside of the Middle Land Divine Continent, and perhaps even more prosperous than the White Frost Continent. 

However, when it came to the number of local upper fifth realm cultivators, it was decidedly meager. 

The old monk hurled his monk’s staff, transforming it into a blue serpent. 

He removed his robe, which suddenly expanded like a vast cloud sea, shrouding dozens of miles of battlefield; upon that robe, it seemed there was a surface of water, lifting the wind with grace. 

The Emperor of the Great Li, during a past decree, had ordered the construction of temples across the continent. 

The Buddhist sect must reciprocate. 

Today, the old monk and the Taoist sat together on the cloud sea during a brief respite, hundreds of zhang apart, communicating through thought. The old monk chuckled, “Why have you come here?” 

“I’ve been idle in the mountains for too long, so I came down to take a look.” 

His place of cultivation was the once-mighty Bai Shuang Dynasty, similar in power to the former Zhu Ying Dynasty. 

However, during the Great Li cavalry’s invasion, the old immortal had not intervened. 

On the path of cultivation, one’s heart must be detached. 

Yet he was not a local cultivator of Baoping Island. He had traveled here and stayed for many years. 

The old Taoist finally smiled, “The grass outside the mountain grows year after year; whether I see it or not, it’s my business. Whether it flourishes or not remains my concern.” 

At the Old Dragon City battlefield, the head offering of the Fu family, sword cultivator Chu Yang, once sought assistance from Xu Ruo, only to reunite in a foreign land. 

This was to assure the wandering swordsman of the Mo family, who had long carried a sword behind him, that saving him had not been in vain. 

Hand in hand with the Sun family’s offering, 

Now the Old Dragon City has established a Fu family mountain and water formation as a barrier, and three large holes have appeared along this southern sea front. Chu Yang was responsible for blocking the invading demon army. 

Exhausted yet exhilarated, 

The mountain and water formation, acting as the core of the Old Dragon City, served not only to resist the demon army that continuously sent soldiers to their deaths, piling up corpses, but also to find those who could break through the formation independently among the upper fifth realm and earth immortals among the demon race for the Southern Mountain Lord Fan Junmao and other enlightened individuals. 

The Great Li’s airborne sword ship was tasked with an offensive against the barbaric world. 

Now, south of the Old Dragon City, it had become the barbaric world. 

In this realm, the Baoping Island blossomed with golden lotus flowers, forming a large formation. 

Moreover, the twenty-four solar term formations continued to circulate without error. 

Cui Zhan stationed at “Bai Yu Jing,” responsible for slashing the great demons. 

A woman sword immortal who had come from afar battled incessantly, wielding a sword without pause. 

Her previous sword, “,” had long since shattered and could no longer be used. The sword she held was one she had pulled from the Floating Duck Sword Lake’s treasury. 

As for the sword that served as the foundation of the mountain peak for the sword immortal, it had been damaged in two major battles in both foreign and native lands. 

This woman sword immortal, with a stunning glance, suddenly broke into a smile. 

Because a man, appearing out of thin air, sent a sword far away, slaying a Yuan Ying demon sword cultivator before fleeing, shouting back, “My lady, you’re especially beautiful tonight, most enchanting!” 

Li Cai laughed in reply, “Does the old lady need you to tell her if she’s beautiful?!” 

At the southernmost part of the Old Dragon City battlefield, Zhou Mi appeared alongside his direct disciple, the sword immortal Shou Chen, and Liu Bai, who had rushed over from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Along with the newly accepted disciple, who was not a sword cultivator, the wooden clogs of Jia Shen. Once a youth, now a young man. 

Shou Chen frowned, “In such a small Baoping Island, what extraordinary talents are there? The records of the past sixty years are all here; where did these unexpected occurrences come from? Did I miss something in the records?” 

Wooden clogs shook their heads, “Senior Brother did not miss any reports.” 

Zhou Mi smiled, “It’s my fault for being away from home for too long. Also, it’s Cui Zhan’s fault for plotting too much.” 

However, in his eyes, these so-called unexpected occurrences could all be traced. If an accident occurred, it could simply be smoothed over. 

In the history of the Haoran World, there was a saying: “All the schemes and strategies of the world converge upon Jia Sheng.” 

Wooden clogs were full of spirit, stating, “Xiu Hu Cui Zhan is indeed worthy of being the elder brother of the Hidden Official.” 

Zhou Mi laughed, “How much does Cui Zhan weigh? He won’t know until he dies.” 

Zhou Mi waved his hand. 

Moments later. 

On the vast and magnificent sea surface. 

The sound of thunder grew louder, shaking the heavens and the earth. 

It turned out that just outside the sea near the Old Dragon City, another layer of sea surged up to a height of over a hundred zhang. 

This was a divine water technique from the great demon, Fi Fei, who was now the ruler of the rivers in the barbaric world. 

She intended to flood the Old Dragon City! 

On the road north, numerous demon cultivators skilled in water techniques unleashed their divine powers or added spells, all contributing to the overwhelming wave. 

The monstrous wave crashed violently against the troublesome city at the southern tip of Baoping Island. 

On the Dragon Ascending Platform, Zhi Gui transformed into a beam of rainbow light, crossing the Old Dragon City formation and crashing into the sea. Before revealing her true dragon form, she had already killed countless demons within a radius of ten miles. 

Zhou Mi paid no attention to this, merely laughing with his gate-keeping disciple, wooden clogs, “Earlier, you said Cui Zhan is indeed worthy of being the elder brother of the Hidden Official; doesn’t that seem a bit off? It should be that the young Hidden Official is indeed worthy of being Cui Zhan’s junior brother.” 

Zhou Mi looked up, speaking through thought, “Does Xiu Hu agree?” 

The imposing Dharma form, high above the capital of the Great Li, with Cui Zhan cradling Bai Yu Jing, twelve flying swords hovering like sword ships in all directions, Cui Zhan replied nonchalantly, “Jia Sheng’s schemes are indeed disappointing.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 840: No Longer in a Dilemma

Zuo You arrived at a picturesque location adorned with clear mountains and flowing waters, holding a green bamboo staff as he ascended the mountain.

At the foot of the mountain stood a temple, while a Daoist temple crowned its peak, and a academy nestled halfway up the slope. Even if it wasn't within the celestial realms of the Haoran world, it was quite similar in essence.

Zuo You found himself in a foreign land known as the Feathered Ascension Paradise (Yuhua Fudi). With nothing pressing to do and feeling it inappropriate to move his physical body, he decided to send out his Yin spirit for a leisurely journey, taking the opportunity to explore the world’s scenic beauty.

The location he was exploring within this paradise was a revered site for cultivation, renowned as a celestial abode on earth, a must-visit for hermits seeking immortality, and a favored spot for good-hearted men and women to pay their respects and offer incense.

According to legend, this land was home to many immortals in ancient times. They practiced Daoist arts and magical techniques in the mountains, leading to the construction of the Emerald Pine Palace (Cu Song Gong) by imperial decree. Eventually, an immortal achieved enlightenment here, riding a blue dragon formed from an ancient pine tree, ascending to the heavens, a story known throughout the realm. Witnessing this auspicious event, the reigning monarch promptly changed the era name in accordance with heavenly will, establishing the Baoguang Temple (Baoji Guan) in the first year of Auspicious Clouds to honor the immortal's "Feathered Ascension." Over a century later, the dynasty changed, and the temple's incense offerings dwindled. The last documented return of this "immortal" to the mortal realm was when he used supreme powers to retrieve the Baoguang Temple, which had inexplicably sunk into the water, relocating it to the mountain's peak.

The subsequent emperors of the new dynasty hurriedly conferred titles upon the founder of Baoguang Temple – an immortal and true lord – bestowing ever-greater honors, further enriching the temple with plaques and Daoist scriptures, ensuring its lasting prosperity.

In later years, various theories emerged, firmly believing that this immortal, after ascension, not only joined the ranks of the celestial beings but was also granted a high rank by the Heavenly Emperor, akin to the position of the Minister in the human realm. As a result, wherever he went, the gods of mountains, lakes, and hidden sea immortals would come to pay their respects.

Zuo You was, of course, aware that these stories served to embellish the reputation of the paradise. The so-called "immortal" was merely an old cultivator from the Tongye Continent, who had served in the ancestral hall of a sect. He ultimately hit a bottleneck at the Nascent Soul stage, failing to break through for longevity. As time passed, he decayed in both body and spirit until he encountered a massive invasion from the barbaric world. Whether motivated by the belief that his time had come, or for other reasons, the old cultivator chose to die fighting on the battlefield against the demon race that invaded Tongye Continent. The Feathered Ascension Paradise did not escape its fate, falling into the hands of a military camp.

The paradise was supposed to be carried by a direct disciple of a sect to the Baoping Continent, to hand over this Feathered Ascension Paradise to the Old Dragon City, aiding their sect's cultivators in exchanging for a suitable cultivation site from the Great Li Dynasty. 

Feathered Ascension Paradise, vast yet sparsely populated, suffered from a thin spiritual energy; coupled with the sect holding the paradise being unwilling to spend money, it resulted in a historical lack of qualified cultivators. For the sect on Tongye Continent, it was merely a low-grade paradise, barely worth the effort. Spending a fortune on the paradise could disrupt the training of their own qi cultivators, ultimately proving detrimental. Moreover, a sect leader, even if already at the Jade Purity stage, could not claim to be an immortal, and with a limited lifespan, they would only see the immediate future, unable to foresee the potential benefits of enhancing the paradise in a millennium. The other elders in the ancestral hall, having even lower realms and shallower Daoist arts, would be even more short-sighted, unable to recognize the long-term advantages of improving the paradise. After all, what benefit would it be for them a thousand years hence?

However, for the Great Li Song Clan, it did solve some pressing issues, allowing for the relocation of the most southern vassal states' citizens conveniently. The low status of Feathered Ascension Paradise was actually advantageous, as it posed minimal risks; the conflicts between those on the mountain and the mundane folk below could almost be ignored. Settling the displaced persons would incur hardly any cost.

As for how the paradise ultimately fell into the hands of the demon army, Zuo You was not particularly interested. Whether driven by human greed or unforeseen events, it simply resulted in his current detention.

As a scholar-like man dressed in green with a bamboo staff, Zuo You was overlooked by the passing incense burners, as he was a common sight.

He stopped at a bustling vendor area halfway up the mountain, where a sign proclaimed, "Last Chance to Drink, Hurry Up!" 

It was a vulgar yet endearing sight. 

The vendor reminded patrons that sincerity was required when offering incense; for those who loved alcohol, it was best to quench their thirst here. Otherwise, after climbing high and drinking, if one appeared drunk to the celestial beings with opened heavenly eyes, it could invite displeasure, making one's wishes ineffective.

The path for burning incense up the mountain was filled not only with earnest worshippers but also many porters who earned their keep by carrying the incense bearers' luggage or hauling stones up the mountain to help accumulate materials for the construction of new buildings at the temple. The former made little money, while the latter earned more, but the labor was truly exhausting. Thus, some affluent incense bearers would allow the porters to rest here and treat them to a bowl of alcohol to bolster their strength and spirit.

Zuo You bought a bowl of loose wine, but the crowd at the stall took up several tables, leaving little room. Not wanting to squeeze in with others, he decided to move a bit further away.

Seeing a customer about to walk away to drink, the vendor quickly raised his voice, demanding a deposit first; otherwise, the customer couldn’t wander too far with the wine. 

If an unscrupulous drinker finished their wine and carelessly tossed the empty bowl off the cliff, it would be a headache for the vendor to seek compensation. 

Reluctantly, Zuo You returned to the vendor, paying extra before making his way to the railing at the cliff's edge, gazing at the distant mountains and waters, which undulated like a scene from a basin.

Earlier, the scholar Shoucheng "asked for the sword" at Tongye Sect, actively offering Tongye Sect a bright future. Regardless of the demon race's intentions, it was clear they aimed to turn misfortune into fortune for Tongye Sect. After all, that scholar who went by the name Zhou Mi had made his appearance; he was the second highest-ranking demon lord of the barbaric world, and his vows and promises held weight.

It should be noted that in the southernmost part of Tongye Continent, during the meeting at the Yu Gui Sect's ancestral hall, they rejected the proposal of a round-faced woman in cotton clothing, refusing to hand over the Cloud Cave Paradise controlled by the Jiang Clan. As a result, the demon army launched relentless attacks, not holding back in their efforts.

The irritable elder of the Yu Gui Sect cursed Jiang Shangzhen, calling him a harbinger of doom, while simultaneously slaughtering demon cultivators. 

He swore that if he met his demise, both Yu Gui Sect and Cloud Cave Paradise would be fortunate to survive, and Jiang Shangzhen would have to come to his grave to express gratitude, making sure to do so loudly, or he wouldn't hear it.

This seemed to be what they referred to as the cycle of fortune and misfortune. Those who enjoyed watching jokes often became the subject of such jokes.

For years, Yu Gui Sect had reveled in the grand spectacle of Tongye Sect's misfortune, and it appeared that now it was the Tongye Sect's turn to witness Yu Gui Sect's downfall. This opportunity was just within reach, enough to simply nod in agreement.

As long as the Tongye Sect's ancestral hall seized this opportunity, it was possible that in the future, they could directly swallow Yu Gui Sect, turning that rival into a subordinate sect, which was no longer a mere fantasy.

However, among the cultivators of Tongye Sect, the morale was fractured yet not shattered. The opinions within the sect were split evenly down the middle.

Zuo You was actually quite surprised; he had initially thought that the cultivators of Tongye Sect, regardless of age, would immediately turn against him, driving him out of their territory. To his astonishment, the younger cultivators, who were lower in rank and age, managed to shoulder the burden together, resolutely refusing the invitation from the barbaric world while even seeking out Zuo You, daring to say, "We sincerely ask Mr. Zuo to stay. You can leave everything behind to us."

Having lived for several more hundred or thousand years, the older cultivators still wished to prolong their lives, while the young ones, who had barely walked the path of enlightenment for a few years, were willing to face death.

In that moment, Zuo You felt as if the world was truly improving.

In the past, the circumstances rarely left Zuo You feeling unencumbered.

For instance, when encountering those arrogant sword cultivators who relied on brute strength and authority, Zuo You would feel troubled, unsure whether to kill them outright or merely incapacitate them. 

As long as Zuo You remained within Tongye Sect, with sword energy still present in Tongye Continent, he would be like a thorn in the side of the barbaric world that could not be expelled.

After Xiao Xian shattered the Flying Ascension realm and assumed the form of Xun Yuan, he went to the relatively stable Southern Posa Continent, intending to capture the sun and moon resting on Chen Chuan'an's shoulders while also stopping by to see Lu Zhi.

Therefore, the advice from the wooden clogs of Jia Shen suggested that the sword immortal Shoucheng be responsible for the implementation of plans, ultimately using a low-grade paradise with a total population of fewer than ten million to successfully detain Zuo You.

Though Shoucheng appeared to be questioning Zuo You about his sword, his true tactic was to suddenly open the heavenly restrictions of the Feathered Ascension Paradise, mercilessly crashing down upon Zuo You. At the same time, within the paradise, a despondent demon cultivator at the Jade Purity stage beckoned to Zuo You, indicating clearly that he could either join their ranks or watch helplessly as the paradise crumbled before him.

Simultaneously, Zhou Mi executed a grand plan to shift the heavens, causing Zuo You to be trapped within the paradise.

Zuo You did not allow the paradise to collapse within the territory of Tongye Sect. In addition to slashing at the demon race, he employed sword energy to traverse the celestial barriers, using his own sword energy as a great formation to protect the paradise.

Without hesitation.

Then Zhou Mi restored the original mountains and rivers, and Shoucheng immediately sealed the paradise's restrictions, isolating the large and small worlds, momentarily confining Zuo You there. He first rooted the paradise in Tongye Continent, aligning it with the overarching Dao of the barbaric world and ordered two demon lords at the celestial realm to continuously attack the paradise's barrier using spells and divine powers, collaborating with celestial arts to wear down Zuo You's sword intent and Daoist progress. They neither pursued the result of breaking the paradise nor allowed Zuo You to feel too comfortable within the Feathered Ascension Paradise.

In this way, even if Zuo You casually drew a sword, it would disturb the heavens and earth, allowing him to escape. However, if no one tended to the paradise, it would lead to chaos, resulting in countless deaths.

Once Zuo You stabilized the boundary of the heavenly barrier, he began to scrutinize the small paradise carefully.

With a body suffused with lofty sword intent, he was still far removed from the mundane world.

Zuo You wished to leave the paradise and return to the Haoran world of Tongye Continent, which was exceedingly simple; a single sword stroke could easily part the heavens, disregarding the life and death of the Feathered Ascension Paradise. It was not just Zuo You; even Jiang Shangzhen, with a single willow leaf, could achieve the same.

Thus, trapping Jiang Shangzhen in this place was utterly meaningless. Jiang Shangzhen would undoubtedly strike decisively with his sword, and once he did, not only would the paradise suffer millions of casualties, but it could even shatter completely, and millions of mundane folk would perish without a second thought. Jiang Shangzhen would not experience even a ripple in his mindset.

In the past, Jiang Shangzhen had nearly met his end in his own trap, questioning the rogue earth immortal causing trouble in the Cloud Cave Paradise; the death toll among the mountain folk and the mundane exceeded a hundred thousand.

However, Zuo You intended to remain here temporarily until he devised a solution that wouldn’t put him in a dilemma.

This left Zuo You's physical body completely immobile, as if he were in a meditative trance at his previous resting place. Zhou Mi's tactics were quite remarkable; before Shoucheng smashed through the paradise, he had long ago set a "Heavenly Edict" within the paradise, akin to "acting on behalf of heaven," specifically to suppress the sword energy of the mundane realm. Therefore, Zuo You could only send out his Yin spirit on a distant journey; otherwise, pulling a single thread would affect the entire body. The so-called heavenly laws here could not harm the sword immortal Zuo You in the slightest, yet they would cause trouble for the mortals below.

For instance, when Zuo You previously sliced through the demon race, he cleaved a massive chasm over ten thousand miles long in the sky above the paradise. This was still Zuo You exerting effort to guide his sword energy and the Dao's operation; otherwise, after slaying the demon, countless disasters would have befallen the mundane world.

That chasm, resembling a tear in the sky, hung like a long rainbow of sword energy in the eyes of the few cultivators who dared to tread the Feathered Ascension Paradise, shimmering beautifully, flowing eternally with the sword energy.

With Zuo You's overwhelming sword energy, invincible and lethal, he could only use it to maintain the boundaries of the heavens, preventing the demon cultivators' spells from recklessly breaking through the paradise's barrier.

Otherwise, if the celestial phenomena stirred even slightly, the common folk of Feathered Ascension Paradise would suffer all kinds of natural disasters, whether it be continuous torrential rain leading to floods, years of drought turning the earth barren, or heavy snow blanketing the entire winter, killing all living things.

Initially, Zuo You had suspected that within the paradise, there might be demons left behind as hidden threats, perhaps a high-ranking demon lord lying in wait. However, after several inspections of the heavens and earth, he found no such signs.

This was normal; in the face of such a great battle, if they shattered the paradise, leading to the mountains and rivers' destruction, it would mean Zuo You could completely break free from his restraints. At that point, it would not simply be a matter of Jiang Shangzhen wielding a willow leaf, poking and prodding; it would be far more complicated.

Having confirmed that there were no major hidden demons in the Feathered Ascension Paradise, Zuo You began to send out his Yin spirit on a distant journey.

Though named the Feathered Ascension Paradise, it was misnamed, merely the private property of a low-tier sect on Tongye Continent.

In ancient times, cultivators here had "ascended" after forming their Golden Core, but on the "other side of the sky" within Tongye Continent, as they navigated their cultivation paths, the sect had attracted attention. Even if the cultivators hid deeply, their homeland’s paradise was eventually noticed by the mountain's ancestors, who deduced its approximate location from various clues. After spending decades, they finally "fished" this small paradise from the long river of time.

After that, it was only natural that the gates opened wide, allowing the fallen immortals to descend, inspect the paradise, and plunder the earthly treasures that emerged, seeking suitable materials for cultivation.

Unfortunately, this paradise was too barren; the number of heavenly materials and earthly treasures that caught the eye was minimal, and so-called cultivation prodigies found themselves thin on the ground. Occasionally, one might emerge, nurtured with devotion, yet they often proved inadequate, at most achieving the Golden Core stage. For a sect of this tier, even possessing a paradise was a classic case of being unable to cover expenses.

As for the other mountain sects and affluent families, their travels through the paradise were limited by its quality and rank, ultimately leading to minimal gains. Thus, other sects on Tongye Continent deemed their investments in the Feathered Ascension Paradise a loss, and over time, it remained a low-grade paradise. All the sects aspired to upgrade their medium-grade paradises to high-grade ones, tirelessly spending heavenly resources, but upgrading low-grade paradises to medium-grade ones was not something they readily desired. Hence, there arose the saying, "A low-grade paradise is worse than having none."

In the hands of major sects, investments could yield long-term returns, turning losses into profits. However, many smaller sects with insufficient resources often suffered as a result, typically choosing to sell their paradises to wealthier sects.

The quality of a paradise was determined not only by its land and population but also by the amount of spiritual energy contained within. Otherwise, no matter how vast the territory or how populous it was, if the mundane folk were unsuitable for climbing the mountain to cultivate, and if the thresholds for cultivation were too high with significant bottlenecks, the cultivators would all remain at the lower realms, with even the Cave Dwelling realm being a luxury. Thus, the so-called "achieving Dao and becoming immortal" would merely be the first layer of the lower level, and the paradise would inevitably be rated as "low grade."

The Feathered Ascension Paradise's 36th generation Daoist at the Emerald Pine Palace and the first abbot of Baoguang Temple was a cultivation genius who gathered the world’s spiritual energy and merits in a low-grade paradise. Not only did he attain the unprecedented Dragon Gate realm, but he also successfully formed a Golden Core, thus gaining favor from the Dao of heaven and earth, allowing him to break through the skies and journey far.

Regrettably, the world is ever-changing.

For those born in a paradise, some fortunate individuals carrying the fate of heaven and earth, the rise of one immortal could spell the onset of calamities for the world.

This Feathered Ascension Paradise, fortunate among misfortunes, preserved itself and has yet to be destroyed. Many paradises in the history of the Haoran world have faced tragic fates due to someone “ascending” and inadvertently revealing their roots, failing to be taken in by a major sect, ultimately leading to the paradise's destruction and the extinction of its inhabitants. Many low-grade paradises have been thoroughly depleted by cultivators, completely severing the path for local cultivators to ascend.

Of course, low-grade paradises often flourished thanks to a single individual, rising amidst the Haoran world.

A beautifully dressed young woman, while her elders rested, took her maid beside her and, under the pretense of enjoying the scenery, approached the scholar in green who sat alone drinking wine. She lifted her veil slightly, revealing a rosy face, and softly asked, “May I ask where this young master is from?”

Zuo You turned to reply, “From a place that a young lady has never heard of.”

The young woman blushed even more, as red as rouge, and smiled, “If you say so, I would still know.”

Zuo You shook his head and replied, “Even if I told you, young lady, you still wouldn't know.”

In the past, Zuo You either ignored such encounters or merely answered a question.

However, after reuniting and parting with his teacher last time, Zuo You felt that perhaps he needed to change his temperament.

For instance, could he treat a young woman’s flirting as a serious "sword question"?

So today, Zuo You spoke a few more words than usual.

For some reason, the young woman felt embarrassed and annoyed, turning to leave. The girl beside her was even more furious, feeling that this scholar was too dull, wasting his good looks.

Well, that was the end of the "sword question."

Clean and straightforward, without dragging things out.

Zuo You turned and walked away, returning the empty bowl to the vendor, who muttered a few complaints about how a bowl of wine took forever to drink, wondering whether the scholar had come to burn incense or to swindle wealthy women.

Fueled by resentment, the vendor quietly grumbled, “You hear me, but no one else does. If you don’t have a broad mind, you’ll be ruining your own reputation. If it comes to fighting, you think you can handle me?!”

Ordinary scholars would simply let it slide, heading up the mountain to burn incense and avoiding trouble.

However, that scholar suddenly stopped and said, “Say that again.”

The vendor’s anger flared up, but after taking another look at the tall scholar before him, he reluctantly turned his gaze away, not daring to meet the fierce-looking man’s eyes, muttering, “Nothing, nothing, sir must have misheard.”

Zuo You extended his hand.

The vendor paused for a moment before remembering to return the coins Zuo You had previously advanced. After handing over the money, he continued to grumble, thinking, “What a miser!”

Zuo You continued his ascent towards the Emerald Pine Palace. The battle death of an old Nascent Soul cultivator in a foreign land seemed like a mere drop in the bucket against the grand tide of the Haoran world, but Zuo You did not share that sentiment.

In the past, the Confucian Sage's four direct disciples would ponder over seemingly trivial matters like this; Cui Chen would explore the subtleties of human nature, perhaps gleaning insights into someone or something, consuming months of time.

The large fellow was indifferent; when greater matters loomed, he felt that if he were to be provoked, one must be capable enough to do so, or it would all be meaningless. Xiao Qi might think more about local customs, yet Zuo You was determined to confront others directly, unwilling to relent until things were clarified. 

In his youth, Zuo You had suffered greatly because of this, leading his teacher to frequently leave the study, preoccupied with resolving the troubles he had caused. Especially after Zuo You turned to sword training, this tendency only intensified.

Whenever his teacher pulled Zuo You aside to apologize face-to-face, the old scholar would often lose his temper at his stubborn student, sometimes even delivering a slap to the back of his head, pressing him to lower his head and apologize!

Yet after each reluctant apology, once out of others' sight, his teacher would delve into greater principles and clarify where true right and wrong lay. The principles discussed would gradually distance Zuo You from petty conflicts, ultimately lifting his head higher and higher!

“Study more, read more! Don’t just practice swordsmanship; that will only lead to trouble! You must understand the teachings of the sages. In the future, when you draw your sword to pierce the sky, your teacher will help mend the heavens!” But until that day, he had to read more and use the Dao and the suffering of the world as a sheath for his sword; otherwise, how could his teacher trust him to train in swordsmanship without studying?

Upon reaching the summit, Zuo You beheld the Emerald Pine Palace, its green glazed tiles shimmering. However, this glaze was not made from celestial materials; it merely represented the favor of earthly emperors.

Zuo You did not approach the temple filled with incense offerings, instead choosing a quieter spot higher up to gaze into the distance.

It would only worry his teacher; he would not be the one to alleviate his teacher's concerns.

In this regard, it was clear that the large, foolish fellow performed best; not to mention Zuo You, even Xiao Qi could not match him. 

Not retaliating when scolded, nor striking back when hit, he remained close to his teacher, nearly never causing trouble.

Zuo You looked up, first frowning, then relaxing, stifling a laugh.

Someone had broken through the heavenly restrictions with a punch, scattering the sword energy barrier casually, leading Zuo You to initially think that a high-ranking demon from the Flying Ascension realm had arrived, naturally worrying for the safety of the paradise.

However, once Zuo You recognized the unexpected visitor’s appearance, his mood brightened. He subtly revealed a bit of his sword intent for the other party to see at a glance, simultaneously guiding the sword energy to obscure their presence, ensuring that they did not draw too much attention while traversing the Feathered Ascension Paradise.

Noticing Zuo You's sword intent, the visitor promptly restrained their aura and approached the mountain Zuo You occupied. Yet, even so, the ground trembled slightly beneath the heavy-set figure's feet, sending ripples through the pine trees, leading the incense bearers to mistakenly think an immortal had manifested. Many patrons, who had already left the Emerald Pine Palace, hurried back to offer their prayers.

Liu Shili smiled widely, “It took me a while to find you.”

Before coming here, Liu Shili had journeyed across continents to Tongye, first visiting the northernmost Tongye Sect without involving himself in their matters, only inquiring about Zuo You’s whereabouts. He then traveled south, learning from a sword cultivator named Zhou Fei, who called himself a disciple of the Fallen Mountain, that Zuo You was precisely detained within Tongye Continent. Prior to breaking down the door, he indeed encountered the so-called terrifying celestial "great demons" mentioned by Zhou Fei. Zhou Fei had advised Liu Shili to be cautious, as he had a good impression of Liu Shili; the reputation of Jiang Shangzhen, who wielded the willow leaf to slay demons on Tongye Continent, was already widespread, and now even Baoping Continent was discussing the new Yu Gui Sect leader's combat style with great admiration.

At the same time, the entire True Realm Sect's reputation was also rising alongside Jiang Shangzhen.

Liu Shili's only unfavorable impression of this individual was their incessant chatter. Traveling alongside Liu Shili for thousands of miles, the incessant questions were ones Liu Shili found impossible to answer, such as whether he would ever have the chance to become the first disciple of the Fallen Mountain or whether the child he was raising with Liu Shili's junior was being mischievous at the Book Lake.

Thus, after parting ways with Jiang Shangzhen, Liu Shili inadvertently flicked his fingers, destroying the body of a demon cultivator at the celestial realm.

The demon’s body shattered like a cicada’s molt.

The Dao was damaged, causing a slight descent in rank.

Liu Shili did not pursue the escaping demon cultivator, instead focusing on the task at hand.

Zuo You remained silent.

Liu Shili, accustomed to this, began discussing the recent happenings regarding their teacher and the situation in Baoping Continent.

After Zuo You listened, his face remained expressionless.

Liu Shili sighed, “That’s all I know; I can’t provide any more details.”

Only then did Zuo You say, “Call for the senior brother.”

The large fool remained oblivious.

Liu Shili had no choice but to call out, “Left Senior Brother.”

Among their peers, the highest rank belonged to Senior Brother Zuo You.

Only then did Zuo You say, “Thank you for your hard work.”

Liu Shili tentatively suggested, “How about we switch places? I can handle dealing with a few ancient gods that have traveled far to Haoran, but the rest is not suited for me.”

After pondering for a moment, Zuo You nodded, “That’s fine.”

With his junior brother Jun Qian, there was no need for any formalities.

Liu Shili hesitated.

Zuo You frowned, “Jun Qian, speak your mind.”

Liu Shili said, “While I was heading south to Baoping Continent, I spoke with the eldest senior brother. It seems he is already aware of your situation. Therefore, I came this time to allow you to cross the continent directly to the Great Li capital. Of course, if you are unwilling, you can remain in Tongye Continent. However, here, you will only be able to go to Yu Gui Sect, as the Tongye Sect you previously protected has severely fractured. One faction of young people has been detained by several of the ancestors and their cultivators. But fret not; those captives are temporarily safe.”

Zuo You replied, “Then I will go to Yu Gui Sect.”

He did not hesitate at all.

Liu Shili sighed, as expected. Thus, he relayed the words his eldest senior brother had prepared for him, “Left Senior Brother, you have yet to visit Fallen Mountain, right? There’s a hope for each chair outside the Zhise Peak Ancestral Hall to be occupied by someone truly sitting there, or that someone has indeed sat there. Ultimately, all of them will come together to complete a painting. Our teacher, before his departure, sat in the center, and I moved a chair to a certain spot when I left Fallen Mountain… Of course, whether you go or not, whether there is a genuine Left Senior Brother seated outside, the painting can still be completed later. After all, Fallen Mountain today is not lacking in celestial arts.”

Zuo You paused for a moment before nodding, “Then let’s first visit Fallen Mountain. I will then head to Old Dragon City to see if there have been any improvements in Wei Jin swordsmanship. The Great Sword Immortal once had high hopes for this person.”

After that, he planned to visit Tongye Sect to let certain people understand just how troublesome the sword cultivator Zuo You could be.

Just as Liu Shili’s mouth began to curve into a smile, he suddenly noticed Zuo You's icy gaze, causing him to suppress his smile immediately. He first enveloped the surroundings with his aura, plus Zuo You's sword energy, creating a second barrier of heaven and earth before pulling out a map displaying the Central Mountain, Great Ravine, and Great Li capital. He tossed it on the ground, allowing Zuo You to step onto it and cross the two continents.

In truth, the eldest senior brother had previously cheerfully mentioned allowing those from afar to cross continents on their own; this was no ordinary matter. His esteemed self, Cui Chen, was also creating a path for the first time. Regardless, even if it didn’t work out, Zuo You was a great sword immortal and wouldn’t fear any accidents.

However, Liu Shili was not foolish enough to share this with Zuo You. The latter already had a contentious relationship with the eldest senior brother; if they truly clashed, it would not bode well.

When the junior brother complained, the senior brother suffered. When the senior brother fought, the junior brother bore the brunt. This was an old tradition among the disciples of the Confucian Sage.

The first junior brother was Xiao Qi, and the second unfortunate one was Jun Qian.

Especially when some unwarranted disaster struck, their teacher would heartily comfort the younger disciples, saying, “Xiao Qi, this time it was indeed your fault. Your senior brother Zuo You was actually being reasonable! It’s fine; if you are truly upset, just hit Jun Qian. Remember not to hurt yourself too much; it would be a shame to delay reading and writing tomorrow. Jun Qian, come here! Why are you just standing there like a wooden statue?”

Fortunately, such instances were rare. Their teacher would often give a knowing glance, and Xiao Qi would never retaliate, quickly calming down and instead lecturing the teacher for being biased and that he should adhere to the principles of right and wrong. The old scholar would then realize, clapping his hands, pledging to rectify his behavior next time. Such scenes frequently led two heads to peek around corners: the lower one belonged to Zuo You, while the taller one rested gently on Zuo You’s head, that of the eldest senior brother Cui Chen.

Thus, Liu Shili couldn’t help but feel a sense of regret, as if those beautiful times had vanished without a trace.

That was why Liu Shili agreed to Cui Chen's suggestion for Zuo You to visit Fallen Mountain, allowing the remaining three direct disciples of the Confucian Sage lineage to rekindle some semblance of beauty in their hearts, even as time passed and the world changed.

Before Zuo You moved, he solemnly stated, “Jun Qian, regardless of the reasons, my visit here has brought about certain celestial phenomena. Previously, I supported the heavens and earth with my sword energy, and there are calamities brewing in the shadows, which will eventually strike here.”

Liu Shili seemed not to understand.

Zuo You spoke sternly, “Junior Brother Jun Qian!”

The one who most loved to assert his seniority was at it again.

There was no helping it; the senior brother was the senior brother, and the junior brother remained a junior.

Liu Shili sighed, saying, “I understand. Not only will I ensure the stability of the heaven and earth here, but I will also be responsible for compensating the paradise.”

Zuo You lightly tossed the staff he was using to Liu Shili, saying, “Jun Qian, this is for you.”

Liu Shili broke into a smile as he caught the common staff. In the past, obtaining anything extra from the money-managing Left Senior Brother had been as difficult as ascending to the sky. 

The brothers could not manage it, and neither could their teacher.

Then Zuo You performed a formal farewell gesture to his junior brother.

Liu Shili returned the gesture respectfully.

Zuo You stepped onto the painted scroll, his physical body instantly merging with his Yin spirit.

The sword immortal and the scroll vanished in a flash.

In this small paradise, Liu Shili, relieved of the burdens of suppressing the sword energy, faced fewer restrictions than Zuo You. However, Liu Shili had little interest in exploring the world; while dispelling the celestial phenomena triggered by Zuo You's physical body, he rode the winds across the skies, ultimately seeking out a desolate mountain, preparing to follow his master's orders to take in a qualified disciple. Whether it be talent or aptitude, it was all part of the equation; teaching them the principles of the sages and instilling a few key phrases would be sufficient for the disciple to practice.

Thus, on that lonely mountain peak, Liu Shili observed a small demon yet to fully manifest its human form. The little demon stood on two feet outside its cave, struggling to use chopsticks to eat a bowl of soup dumplings, which had gone cold and mushy. Each time it attempted to grab the dumplings, they would slip from its grip and fall back into the bowl. Frustrated, the little creature eventually threw the chopsticks back into the bowl, raising its claws to curse the tableware, “Eat, eat, eat! You eat your dumplings!”

The little demon had fetched the dumplings from a distant village with great effort, not wanting them to be ruined by the messy creatures of the mountain. It was startled when it suddenly caught sight of the burly lumberjack, worried he had come to collect debts. The little demon was genuinely frightened. Seeing such a muscular figure, it doubted he would be reasonable.

Realizing that it had learned only a few superficial celestial arts from the books, it felt inadequate to confront the lumberjack. 

The little demon, filled with indignation, thought, “I paid for that bowl of dumplings! Not only did I give a few coins, but I even tossed in some wild game I found in the mountains! If I hadn’t read those few sage books in the cave, I would have been an old scholar by now. Just think about it! Not only would I have stolen your dumpling, but I could have taken the entire pot you used to cook them!”

What an outrageous act! After paying, he had the audacity to come to my home and shout? This is simply unreasonable! The little demon lingered at the cave entrance, feeling that the lumberjack must be a brutish man who had never read a book; there was no need to argue. It reluctantly ate the bowl of cold dumplings.

As this thought crossed its mind, the little demon sighed, steeling its courage to hide beside the cave without showing itself, deliberately making noise to scare off the hungry lumberjack. It feared that if it stayed too long, it might attract a glutton and bring bad luck upon itself.

It wouldn’t heal others, as the books had taught it nothing of the sort. The Daoist scriptures only contained illustrations of refining a human form by worshiping the sun and moon, and it had only skimmed through them, barely grasping the basics.

A self-styled whirlwind king was no true king; it was merely a source of amusement for itself.

Liu Shili suddenly remembered that shortly after arriving in the paradise, he had neither spoken the official language nor understood any dialect, leaving him feeling somewhat awkward as he gazed towards the cave entrance. He scratched his head.

The little demon, upon seeing Liu Shili, nearly burst into tears. Oh boy, the lumberjack who had eaten his fill now seemed ready to beat someone up! Unable to restrain itself, it trembled all over, thinking, “Don’t hit me! I’m not human…”

These lumberjack hunters who liked climbing mountains were all fierce individuals. As long as this man remained indifferent, they could pack their bags and move away. Moving far away would be just fine!

Liu Shili devised a plan to fetch a half-baked cultivator to learn the language first, so they could converse. Even if it was merely a temporary arrangement, securing two unnamed disciples in one go would be a good outcome. Whether he could ultimately take them as disciples or if they would become his true disciples or simply remain unnamed, that would all depend on their fortunes. Liu Shili was not one to indiscriminately accept disciples. 

His teacher had reminded these students numerous times: never view accepting disciples as a form of charity. Bringing disciples into his fold, whether as a schoolteacher or a mountain master, if a preacher views his knowledge as something to be thrown down from a high position, the hearts of the people will only drift away.

The little demon, seeing the lumberjack walk away, breathed a sigh of relief, mustering courage as if tidying up the mountains and rivers, swaggering out of the cave, feeling self-important. The whirlwind king would scare away a burly man; he would not need to move his home. 

Thinking grandly, the little demon hurriedly gathered its belongings, quickly stashing the few books away, and finally knelt respectfully at a small grave, bowing its head and reciting a few words. It promised to return and visit the old deity again. After finishing its bow, the little demon slipped away.

Liu Shili had not genuinely left; instead, he used a technique to conceal himself and stayed closely behind the little demon.

In ancient times, Liu Shili had learned some heavenly arts that revealed the true nature of the human heart, and he was quite pleased with this observation. 

Just like himself, the little demon appeared quite perceptive.

Above the central area of Baoping Continent, amidst the sea of clouds, the physical manifestation of Cui Chen, the national teacher of the Great Li, was seen as he imparted knowledge to numerous young scholars from various countries. However, none of the students, even those from the Guanhu Academy and Shanyan Academy, had received the title of gentleman or sage.

A slender figure in a green robe appeared at the edge of the sea of clouds, yet Cui Chen remained focused, continuing to elucidate the intricate philosophies of the Hundred Schools to the young scholars.

Many scholars noticed the anomaly, particularly those from the Guanhu Academy who had cultivated the Haoran Qi, becoming acutely aware, prompting most to turn and look toward that person.

Zuo You, however, did not glance toward Cui Chen, but instead focused on those turning to look at him, frowning as he admonished, “Entering the Seventy-Two Academies doesn’t mean you’re to become celestial beings?!”

Zuo You then transformed into a majestic beam of sword light, heading straight for the northern region, parting the sea of clouds near the Baiyu Capital with his sword energy, which took a long time to converge again.

Cui Chen continued his lecture, neither addressing the traveling sword immortal Zuo You nor obstructing the young scholars from momentarily losing focus, allowing them to revel in their excitement and speculate about the identity of the sword immortal.

Zuo You hovered momentarily at the entrance to the Northern Mountain region, before finally landing at the Fallen Mountain. Chen Nuanshu helped him open the door, and Zuo You first offered incense within the Zhise Peak Ancestral Hall. Meanwhile, Zhou Milin had already set up chairs outside, placing them in a position that seemed meticulously arranged; not a single detail could go wrong. The little girl in black had even knelt on the ground, looking up to ensure everything was perfectly aligned.

Finally, Zuo You took his seat on the chair, dressed in green, observing the scene before him.

It felt as if his teacher was seated centrally, alongside his junior brother Jun Qian, junior brother Qi Jingchun, and junior brother Chen Ping'an. The eldest senior brother… Cui Chen.

They all surrounded Zuo You.

It felt as if there were many other disciples and students of Fallen Mountain behind him.

The lineage of the Confucian Sage was branching out, flourishing.

Lively and no longer solitary.

Zuo You adjusted his collar, sitting upright, both fists resting lightly on his knees, gazing forward with a smile.

After Zuo You stood, he became the sword immortal Zuo You. From now on, he would no longer be in a dilemma when drawing his sword.
