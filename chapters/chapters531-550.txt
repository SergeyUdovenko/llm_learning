 ### Chapter 531: Does Luo Po Mountain Have a Place for Chen Ping’an? (Part 1)

---

The second floor of the bamboo building.

Chen Ping’an sat cross-legged, fists pressed against his knees, panting heavily. His face was smeared with blood, and the floor beneath him echoed with the sound of dripping.  

Fortunately, the bamboo building was profoundly mystical, functioning almost like a natural cleansing talisman. Its “pristine elegance” remained untouched, no matter the mess.  

Still, it was said that the little girl in the pink dress often carried a small bucket to the second floor, scrubbing the floors day in and day out. Because of this, she was the only “outsider” allowed on the second floor.  

The sparring session had come to an end. Judging by the disheveled state of Chen Ping’an and the calm, barefooted old man across from him, the truth of their so-called “training” was plain to see.  

Chen Ping’an couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Unlike the grueling body-tempering exercises the old man had imposed on him in the past, this time, the training focused more on refining combat techniques. It also seemed to unintentionally—or perhaps intentionally—help solidify his burgeoning “unstoppable fist intent,” a state of mind where no one stood before him. Occasionally, when the old man was in a good mood, he would mutter some rhyming principles of martial arts. Whether Chen Ping’an, often sprawled on the ground after yet another punch, heard or could even remember them was of little concern to the old man.  

Unable to hold back, Chen Ping’an finally asked, “Why don’t I need to temper my body, spirit, and soul anymore?”  

Cui Cheng sneered. “Teaching a child how to use chopsticks to eat is one thing, but when that child grows into a teenager, do I need to teach it again? Are you that dense, or do you think I’m blind for picking a fool like you?”  

Chen Ping’an hesitated, unsure. Martial artists were supposed to distill the essence of “purity” at every stage of their practice. It felt different from the way cultivators, after learning ancient techniques, were left to their own devices.  

Cui Cheng seemed unwilling to dwell on the topic. “I heard you used to spar often with Zhu Lian, who suppressed himself at the Golden Body stage?”  

Chen Ping’an nodded. “It was always a struggle.”  

Cui Cheng shook his head. “You were worlds apart. Zhu Lian wouldn’t dare kill you, and you knew he wouldn’t. It was as useless as a couple of love-struck fools bickering. You scratch him, he pats you, and neither of you truly benefits in martial arts.”  

Chen Ping’an felt a chill run down his spine.  

Cui Cheng continued, “Starting tomorrow, bring Zhu Lian up to the second floor. I’ll supervise your sparring myself.”  

Chen Ping’an frowned. “How would that be any different?”  

Cui Cheng chuckled coldly. “Different? If Zhu Lian dares to spar with you without a killing intent, I’ll kill him with one punch. Do you think he’d risk that? Make sure you explain this to him properly. I’d hate to have to repeat myself to a corpse.”  

Chen Ping’an smiled faintly. “So you think Zhu Lian has potential after all?”  

Cui Cheng smirked. “The day I beat the cunning and wealth out of that man until there’s nothing left—maybe then he’ll barely catch my eye.”  

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “Even when Zhu Lian suppresses himself at the Golden Body stage, I can’t even seriously injure him. He always seems to have energy to spare. And judging by the flattery he gives after each sparring session, it’s clear he’s holding back.”  

Cui Cheng grinned. “What you can’t do, I can.”  

Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but laugh.  

In this world, there were countless people unafraid of hardship. But the belief that enduring hardship guaranteed rewards? That was rare.  

Although Chen Ping’an didn’t know why Zhu Lian had stayed on Luo Po Mountain for three years without learning boxing from the old man, he understood one thing: if Cui Cheng was willing to teach Zhu Lian, it would be a monumental opportunity. Zhu Lian, who had long been stuck at bottlenecks in both his technique and martial path, would see this as a godsend.  

Chen Ping’an had always respected others’ choices, never forcing them to do anything against their will. Whether it was Sui Youbian’s decision to join the Jade Tablet Sect or Shi Rou’s acceptance of the Immortal’s shed skin, he had left the decision to them. However, if Zhu Lian hesitated to train with Cui Cheng for any reason, Chen Ping’an wouldn’t hesitate to persuade him—no matter how much effort it took.  

Cui Cheng suddenly spoke. “It’s good to be considerate of those around you. But remember, reaching the pinnacle of martial arts, becoming invincible, is ultimately a very… lonely path. Keep that distinction clear.”  

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Once, while studying chess, I devised a sword technique purely on paper. It’s about cutting and delineating boundaries. It helped me navigate many tight spots on Book Lake…”  

Before he could finish, the old man clicked his tongue. “So, a swordsman carrying a Sword Immortal’s blade on his back has such talent in swordsmanship, yet mediocre skills in martial arts. Looks like I’ve wasted your potential to become a great Sword Immortal! What should we do now?”  

Sensing danger, Chen Ping’an prepared to push off the ground and slide away while still seated, hoping to dodge the old man’s inevitable “venting punch.” Standing up to run wasn’t even an option.  

Sure enough, the old man stomped his foot, and the bamboo building shook violently. Chen Ping’an, who had just leaned back slightly, was flung into the air like a kite. In an instant, the towering figure of the old man loomed over him. If he were struck by a single punch, it would have been enough to knock him out instantly. But the old man wasn’t planning to let him off so easily.  

What followed was a brutal barrage of fourteen punches—a perfected “Thunderous Drumbeat” technique, one of Chen Ping’an’s favorite moves to use against his enemies. This time, however, it was the old man who wielded it. Chen Ping’an was like a leaf caught in a storm, tossed and turned in midair, unable to land.  

By the time he finally hit the ground, he had already passed out.  

The sensation of enduring over a dozen punches from the originator of the “Thunderous Drumbeat” was one of unspeakable torment. Even unconscious, Chen Ping’an’s body involuntarily rolled across the floor.  

The old man observed for a moment before nodding in satisfaction. This was a sign that the young man’s fist intent had truly come alive.  

A true martial grandmaster could remain vigilant even in the deepest sleep. At the faintest sense of killing intent, their fist intent would react, allowing them to strike down an enemy in an instant. This was the principle at work.  

But the old man wasn’t done with Chen Ping’an yet. With a precise kick, he struck at the pure Qi within Chen Ping’an’s body, severing it mid-flow as if a cavalry charge had split an enemy formation on the battlefield.  

The joints in Chen Ping’an’s body crackled like firecrackers, producing a sound akin to the beating of war drums. Yet the old man’s Qi was controlled with precision, ensuring the disruption was temporary. Before long, Chen Ping’an’s Qi began to gather again.

 ### Chapter 532: Does Fallen Peak Belong to Chen Ping'an? (Part Two)

It was true that Zhu Lian was ruthless when sparring with him.

But every time Chen Ping’an collapsed in the corner, barely clinging to life, watching Zhu Lian get beaten even worse by the old man, he couldn’t help but feel a little lucky in comparison.

That said, when Zhu Lian was fully immersed in his punches, reaching a state of near madness yet maintaining a crystal-clear and untainted mind, it truly broadened Chen Ping’an’s horizons. 

Perhaps every time it ended, Cui Cheng deliberately refrained from letting him pass out, intending for him to observe.

If not for the vast age gap, and Zhu Lian’s unwavering insistence on maintaining the master-servant dynamic, the two of them might as well have been kindred spirits.

---

It was late at night, and the two sat at a stone table.

Zhu Lian glanced toward the bamboo loft, itching to shout insults in that direction, hoping to provoke someone into giving him a good thrashing. He barely held back.

Chen Ping’an was at a loss for words.

If his own struggles could merely be called "enduring hardship," then Zhu Lian truly embodied the saying, “suffering is bliss.”

Zhu Lian sighed, “The old master, purely in his Golden Body realm, could beat me—a Far Traveler realm cultivator—until I was wailing for my parents. Young Master, back when you were merely in the Fifth Realm, you endured my Golden Body punches head-on. The old master and you truly are rare geniuses in this world.”

Chen Ping’an reminded him, “Leave me out of this.”

Zhu Lian suddenly turned serious. “The old master had a deeper intent.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “He wanted me to understand that in the pursuit of martial arts, there are people like you who exist in this world. My determination pales in comparison.”

Zhu Lian put on an exaggeratedly guilty expression. “Every time my fists landed on you, Young Master, it hurt my heart more than yours.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled in exasperation. “Oh, cut it out.”

Zhu Lian sighed. “Cen Yuanji’s (岑鴛機) progress in her stance training is still too slow.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. He didn’t go out of his way to defend Cen Yuanji, but he did offer a fair statement. “You can’t expect everyone to train like you. Even I back then was only that diligent because I was hanging onto life by a thread.”

Zhu Lian shook his head. “Don’t say that, Young Master, or it would do a disservice to the million punches you diligently threw after your life was no longer at risk.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Is there a way to improve Cen Yuanji’s boxing intent without disrupting her state of mind? Something more natural?”

Zhu Lian nodded. “There is a way, but it would require a significant sacrifice on your part, Young Master.”

Chen Ping’an raised an eyebrow. “Let’s hear it.”

Zhu Lian hesitated, lowering his voice. “Young Master could... pretend to be a lecherous, unscrupulous mountain lord with a martial realm not too high. Then, on some moonless and windy night, just as you’re about to... ahem... succeed after her struggles, I could conveniently appear to plead on her behalf. You, out of pride, would storm off in frustration, but as you step out of the room, you glance back at the bed with lingering resentment in your eyes. Afterward, I would comfort her, making her believe that only by training harder and defeating you could she end such harassment.”

Chen Ping’an took a long swig from his wine gourd to calm his nerves. Finally, he asked, “Why don’t we reverse roles?”

Zhu Lian shook his head helplessly. “Cen Yuanji isn’t that foolish. She wouldn’t believe it. And if she truly did believe it, she’d probably risk her life to sneak off the mountain.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “What I don’t get is, why does Cen Yuanji see you as a good person and me as the bad guy?”

Zhu Lian pondered. “Because, as they say, ‘Women love bad boys’?”

Chen Ping’an briefly considered drawing his sword to cut Zhu Lian in half.

Zhu Lian, sensing danger, quickly changed the subject. In an attempt to curry favor, he shamelessly asked for a pot of wine, lamenting that, as a loyal old servant, he had foolishly refrained from stashing away some of the good wine during his last trip to bury it. Now, he regretted it deeply. Chen Ping’an waved him off, telling him to scram.

Realizing it was hopeless, Zhu Lian smiled, “Young Master, you’re still so young, yet you’re so rigid about matters of love. Isn’t that a bit too old-fashioned? What man doesn’t have a few close female confidants?”

Chen Ping’an reattached the wine gourd to his belt, clasped his hands behind his back, and gazed into the distance. He said softly, “In the future, if I travel far and some woman happens to like me, I may not be able to stop her. But as for myself? If I can’t love only one person for the rest of my life, then what’s the point of it all? I must.”

Zhu Lian scratched his head, remaining silent.

Chen Ping’an waited for a while, then turned to tease him. “What’s this? No clever flattery this time?”

Zhu Lian shook his head and muttered, “Only fools in love deserve no ridicule.”

Chen Ping’an mused, “Only a person in love could say such a thing.”

Zhu Lian slapped the table. “As expected, Young Master is the true hidden master of flattery! Such masterful praise, so seamless and natural—I pale in comparison!”

Chen Ping’an felt his teeth itch but forced a smile. “Zhu Lian, just wait. Once we’re in the same realm, I’ll make you pay.”

Zhu Lian nodded solemnly. “That might just happen tomorrow. It’s not difficult at all.”

Seeing his servant’s expression of unwavering sincerity, as if daring the heavens to strike him down if he were lying, Chen Ping’an was left speechless.

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping’an asked, “I can see that Pei Qian gets along well with the two little ones. But since I’ve been away all these years, is there anything I’ve missed? Any problems you noticed but felt were inappropriate to bring up? If there’s anything, Zhu Lian, don’t hesitate to speak.”

Zhu Lian shook his head, smiling. “In front of Young Master, nothing is unspeakable.”

Chen Ping’an sighed helplessly and pointed a finger at Zhu Lian, indicating he had nothing more to say.

---

“Fallen Peak is still sparsely populated, so problems are minimal. Regarding outside affairs, Young Master has taken care of the major ones himself. As for the smaller matters, such as sending gifts to the neighbors who once helped you when you were down and out, Miss Ruan (阮姑娘) had already established rules for that. With the two shops we run, I’ve simply followed the established procedures—it’s not complicated. 

“Many families have since moved to the county city and prospered. Some politely declined our gifts, though they remain courteous when I visit during the New Year. Others, despite their newfound wealth, have grown greedier. For those who aren’t too excessive, I indulge them, ensuring that Fallen Peak owes them nothing in the future. As for those who make outrageous demands, I simply ignore them. As for the truly impoverished households, I don’t give them much money, but I visit more often, sitting with them and casually asking about their needs. If it’s something manageable, I handle it; if not, I play dumb.”

Zhu Lian spoke at length, his tone steady and calm.

Anyone familiar with Zhu Lian’s past in the Lotus Blossom Blessed Land (藕花福地) would know that he handled worldly affairs, whether grand political matters or trivial domestic squabbles, with practiced ease.

Zhu Lian squinted at the young man in green robes, who had grown accustomed to thinking about everyone else before himself. “As for the small issues, they’ll resolve themselves once you return to Fallen Peak. That’s the truth. So, Young Master, let me say this—no matter how far you go or how difficult your journey, always come back. Fallen Peak will wait for you. Always.”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

Zhu Lian smiled, “That’s enough. When you travel to Beiju Luzhou, don’t worry too much about Fallen Peak. With Old Master Cui, me, and now Brother Gale, you have nothing to fear.”

Chen Ping’an nodded again, then asked curiously, “Why is Shi Rou (石柔) no longer as wary or distant toward you as before?”

Zhu Lian chuckled awkwardly. “Perhaps she’s grown used to my face and realized it’s not as hideous as it seemed? After all, back in the Lotus Blossom Blessed Land, I was praised as a banished immortal and a refined gentleman.”

Chen Ping’an glanced at him and shook his head. “Well, I don’t see it.”

Zhu Lian clasped his hands behind his back, his shoulders shaking as he grinned nostalgically. “Young Master, you wouldn’t understand. Back then, countless women in the Lotus Blossom Blessed Land had their hearts broken just from seeing a single portrait of me.”

Chen Ping’an teased, “Were you more handsome than Cui Dongshan (崔東山) is now?”

Zhu Lian thought for a moment, then replied seriously, “To be honest, I dare say my charm back then was even greater.”

Chen Ping’an sighed, “You must’ve been asking for a beating.”

Zhu Lian laughed, “Which is why I had to take up martial arts. Otherwise, I’d have had to worry about my backside.”

Chen Ping’an paused, then realized the implication and suppressed a smile. “Say that to the old master if you’ve got the guts.”

Zhu Lian waved his hand, grinning. “That’d be courting death.”

Chen Ping’an shifted the conversation. “I wonder how Lu Baixiang, Sui Youbian, and Wei Xian are doing these days.”

Zhu Lian’s expression turned slightly mocking, though his tone remained indifferent. “They’ve gone their separate ways. Each worse off than the last.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled. “Complaining about them behind their backs?”

Zhu Lian smirked. “Young Master sees through everything—divine insight!”

Chen Ping’an suddenly said, “Zhu Lian, if one day you feel like venturing out, just let me know. I mean it; no need for formalities between us.”

Zhu Lian shook his head. “I appreciate the thought, Young Master, but I truly have no desire to travel far. In the Lotus Blossom Blessed Land, I walked enough paths—for family, for country, for duty, for loyalty. It was exhausting. My last journey, especially the contest for the ten greatest warriors in Nanyuan Kingdom, was for myself. I have no regrets in this lifetime. 

“To know oneself is to suffer less; to be content is to always find joy. Young Master, doesn’t that saying deserve to be carved onto a bamboo slip?”

Chen Ping’an had been listening intently, but Zhu Lian’s final comment ruined the moment. With a darkened expression, Chen Ping’an stood and headed to the first-floor room.

Zhu Lian stood, watched him leave, and only sat back down once the door closed.

---

The hunched old man gazed into the night.

Pine seeds rustled in the mountains, and insects chirped softly under the moonlight.

This, truly, is the pinnacle of the mortal world.

What more could one ask for?

After a while, this Far Traveler martial artist, whose heart was as still as water, glanced around to ensure no one was watching. He then secretly pulled a book from his robes, wet his finger with saliva, and began flipping through it.

Ah, reading a forbidden book under the bright autumn moon—what a joy in life.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 533: Does Luopo Mountain Belong to Chen Ping’an? (Part 2)

---

The next day, Chen Ping’an didn’t head to the second floor to be beaten up in training.  

Instead, he had more pressing matters to attend to—an official from the Ministry of Rites of the Great Li Imperial Court had arrived at Piyun Mountain. The purpose of the visit was to formally sign the contract for the transfer of several mountain territories to the Song Clan of Great Li.  

Wei Bo personally came to Luopo Mountain to accompany Chen Ping’an to Linlu Academy, where the senior official and his entourage were already waiting.  

Chen Ping’an wasn’t unfamiliar with this high-ranking official. Back when the world of Lizhu Cave Heaven had fallen and taken root in this realm, he had crossed paths with the elderly Minister of Rites a few times.  

This was Chen Ping’an’s first visit to Linlu Academy, the grandest of the newly established academies in Great Li. Thanks to Wei Bo’s guidance, they bypassed the long corridors and intricate pathways, arriving directly at a secluded spot within the academy.  

Ruan Qiong wasn’t present. The sage of the military arts, who oversaw this place, had left in secret, leaving his disciple Dong Gu—a Golden Core cultivator of the Dragon Spring Sword Sect—in his stead. Dong Gu carried with him a private seal from his master, a token that carried great significance and authority. It was clear that Ruan Qiong had immense trust in this disciple of demonic beast origins.  

On the table lay several important documents.  

There was the primary alliance contract, as well as individual land deeds for various mountain territories. These included Oxhorn Mountain, once owned by Baofu Zhai; Vermilion Sand Mountain, previously held by the Xu Clan of Clear Wind City; the vast and nearby Misty Mountain; Aoyu Ridge; Sunset Peak; and Sword Worship Terrace, situated on the westernmost edge of the mountain range. In total, six mountain territories of varying sizes would officially be transferred to Chen Ping’an’s name.  

The signatures and seals on the documents included Chen Ping’an himself, the elderly Minister of Rites who held both the jade seal of the Great Li Imperial Court and the official seal of the Ministry of Rites, Dong Gu with Ruan Qiong’s seal, and Wei Bo, who removed his golden earring. The earring, through some mysterious divine technique, transformed into a solid round seal.  

Additionally, two vice mountain lords of the academy were present, though their role was more ceremonial than practical.  

One of them was a renowned scholar of Great Li, celebrated within literary circles. Many of the plaques and couplets adorning the temples and shrines of Longquan County were said to be his handiwork.  

The other was someone Chen Ping’an recognized—a scholarly elder from Huangting Kingdom who had once hosted Chen Ping’an and his companions. His true identity, however, was far more extraordinary: an ancient flood dragon who was also the founding patriarch of the Ziyang Mansion and the father of Wu Yi.  

Longquan County’s governor Wu Yuan, Magistrate Yuan, and Overseer Cao—three young officials—were also in attendance.  

Standing beside Dong Gu was a young man named Xie Ling, a disciple of Ruan Qiong and a native of Peach Leaf Alley.  

Under normal circumstances, Xie Ling, even as Ruan Qiong’s student, would not have been present at such a formal occasion. However, his lineage was exceptional—his ancestor was none other than the legendary Heavenly Lord Xie Shi.  

Because of this, Xie Ling’s appearance didn’t draw much attention. Most of those present pretended not to notice him, though the elderly Minister of Rites even exchanged a few polite words with the young man, who bore a natural celestial phenomenon.  

Xie Ling responded with poise—neither arrogant nor timid. After finishing his conversation with the Minister, he fell silent once more. However, when Chen Ping’an, the main figure of the day, finally appeared, Xie Ling cast a few extra glances at the man from Niping Alley.  

In Longquan County’s mountain regions, two names had already become quite famous:  

One was Ma Kuxuan of Apricot Blossom Alley, a prodigy who had taken down a Golden Core sword cultivator in direct combat.  

The other was Chen Ping’an of Niping Alley, who was rapidly acquiring immortal mountains as easily as a farmer might buy a few acres of farmland.  

There were also rumors that Ma Kuxuan and Chen Ping’an didn’t see eye to eye, with whispers of a fierce clash between them at the Immortal Graves in their youth.  

This left Xie Ling curious—how had Chen Ping’an survived that encounter?  

After all, Ma Kuxuan of True Martial Mountain had always been the benchmark Xie Ling silently aspired to surpass.  

And Xie Ling himself wasn’t without his own formidable advantages. With a legendary ancestor like Xie Shi and a nearly divine artifact like the Exquisite Pagoda personally gifted to him by Daoist Patriarch Lu Chen, his sights had long been set on the peaks of Jewel Bottle Continent. Rarely did he bother to glance at the mundane affairs of the mortal world below.  

There were others worth mentioning, of course—like Liu Xianyang, who had turned misfortune into fortune and was now studying under the Chen Clan, a prominent family of Confucian scholars in Nanpusa Continent. While Liu’s future seemed promising, the path of orthodox cultivation was slow and steady, unlike the meteoric rise of prodigies dabbling in unorthodox methods.  

As for Gu Can from Book Slip Lake, his situation was reportedly dire. He had even lost the descendant of a true dragon, and his path seemed to have crumbled entirely. Among the five individuals who had received fortuitous encounters in Lizhu Cave Heaven, Gu Can had been the first to fall.  

Xie Ling didn’t care much for outside affairs, even when his senior brother Dong Gu or senior sister Xu Xiaoqiao mentioned them. He treated such news as idle chatter.  

---

Chen Ping’an arrived in his usual plain green robe, a white jade hairpin securing his hair, a sword gourd at his waist, and a sword strapped to his back. His slightly haggard expression lent him an air of maturity, dispelling any doubts about his youthful appearance.  

Standing amidst the crowd, he neither stood out as particularly impressive nor faded into the background. With a calm demeanor and gentle words, he greeted each person present.  

He reminisced with the old flood dragon about the cliff carvings in Huangting Kingdom and the meals at his forest estate. He complimented the academy’s esteemed scholar on his writings and expressed his desire to visit the academy again in the future to seek guidance on academic questions.  

The elderly Minister of Rites observed everything with a smile.  

This high-ranking official, a respected figure in the imperial court, remembered his first encounter with Chen Ping’an. Back then, the boy had been a shabby youth standing beside Ruan Xiu in Ruan Qiong’s forge. The two had seemed like friends, a relationship that had struck the seasoned official as both surprising and natural.  

From that moment, the Minister had made a note of the young man.  

Even the reticent Dong Gu of the Dragon Spring Sword Sect initiated a few words of conversation with Chen Ping’an.  

The contract signing, though straightforward, was conducted with ceremonial pomp. With the presence of the Great Li court’s record-keeping officials, as well as Wei Bo and Ruan Qiong’s participation, the event was elevated to a grand affair, adhering strictly to Great Li’s rituals.  

The process went smoothly, and the attendees enjoyed a pleasant exchange of words. There was no celebratory feast, as the occasion took place within Linlu Academy. Additionally, the Minister of Rites, burdened with responsibilities as the overseer of the year’s provincial evaluations, left promptly to return to the capital.  

---

Afterward, Chen Ping’an and Wei Bo stood together in a scenic pavilion within Linlu Academy.  

Chen Ping’an didn’t inquire about Gao Xuan, aware that it would be inappropriate given the man was a hostage prince sent from Da Sui to Great Li.  

Wei Bo asked with a smile, “What are you looking at?”  

Chen Ping’an withdrew his gaze and replied with a smile, “Nothing much.”  

From this vantage point at the grand new Linlu Academy, he could faintly make out the outline of the old schoolhouse in the small town—now abandoned, with no one left to teach or study there.  

---

(Translation continues...)

 ### Chapter 534: Gaining Martial Fortune, Eating the Bead  

The narrow Qilong Alley (Riding Dragon Alley) sloped downward with a long flight of stairs leading to the bottom. At the base lay the humble "Grasshead Shop," situated next to the "New Year’s Shop." Both establishments once belonged to the family of Shi Jiachun, the little girl with pigtails who had been a familiar sight in the old town. Years ago, when the children of the town—Li Baoping, Li Huai, and the others—left to study at the Great Sui Academy, Shi Jiachun didn’t follow them. Nor did she remain in the small town like Dong Shuijing. Instead, she moved with her family to the capital of Dali. Before leaving, her family sold the two shops, which eventually came into Chen Ping’an’s possession with the help of Ruan Qiong.

Since then, every time Chen Ping’an returned to his hometown, he would bump into Dong Shuijing. But Shi Jiachun? After their parting, they never met again.  

The Grasshead Shop had originally been a pawnshop of sorts during the Shi family’s ownership, selling miscellaneous items and old relics. Even after moving away, the family left behind half of their collected antiques in the shop, a testament to their wealth and standing. When Chen Ping’an took over the shop, he initially felt guilty—especially after learning the value of those items. He had even thought about closing the shop and returning it, untouched, to the Shi family if they ever came back to visit. However, Ruan Xiu had dissuaded him, reminding him that business was business, and relationships were relationships. 

Over the years, Chen Ping’an grew accustomed to the ways of the world. Though he no longer felt burdened by guilt, he resolved that if the Shi family ever had the cheek to demand the shop back, he wouldn’t refuse. But that would be the end of any goodwill between them. Then again, what was his goodwill worth?  

The shop was now managed by a single employee, an elderly woman of simple and honest temperament. It was said that when Ruan Xiu had been the shopkeeper, she would often sit and chat with the old woman.  

Chen Ping’an recognized her, of course. She was from Xinghua Alley (Apricot Blossom Alley), and though their age gap was nearly forty years, the town’s sprawling network of relations required him to call her “Aunt Chen.” Not that they were truly related.  

Despite her age, the old woman remained robust, having spent her life working the fields. Though her children had moved to Longquan County City and urged her to live with them, she found the large, cold house unbearable. Without familiar faces to bicker with, she eventually returned to the small town. Her filial children had no choice but to allow it, though her daughter-in-law wasn’t pleased. She felt the old woman embarrassed the family by working for mere copper coins in a shop run by someone who had once been the poorest youngster in Ni Ping Alley (Mud Bottle Alley).  

When Chen Ping’an and Pei Qian walked into the shop, he greeted her with a warm “Aunt Chen” and asked about her health and the state of her fields. Then, switching to the town’s dialect, he chatted with the old woman about days long past.  

As they talked, the old woman grew misty-eyed. “If your mother could see you now, how proud she’d be. She worked herself to the bone her whole life and never enjoyed a single day of comfort. That last year, she couldn’t even get out of bed. She didn’t even make it through that winter... Heaven is truly blind.”  

Her voice trembled with sorrow as she began to blame Chen Ping’an’s father. “What good was it for him to be a kind man? He’s still to blame. Leaving just like that... dragged you and your mother down for so many years. But…” She paused, gently patting Chen Ping’an’s hand. “Don’t blame your father. Just think of it as you and your mother repaying a debt from your past lives. Now that it’s settled, it’s a good thing. Maybe in the next life, your family can reunite and share blessings together.”  

Chen Ping’an sat obediently on the long bench, letting her hold his hand as she grumbled and reminisced. He didn’t dare talk back.  

Pei Qian sat on a small stool nearby, quietly munching sunflower seeds while watching this unfamiliar side of her master.  

She found it curious. Her master—this man who could shake the heavens with his strength—was now sitting there, humbly listening to an old woman’s ramblings. He treated her every word as gospel, nodding and taking it all to heart. His usual imposing aura was nowhere to be seen. Instead, his demeanor was serene and peaceful.  

Before coming down to the shop, Pei Qian had felt deeply wronged by something. But knowing her master was busy practicing boxing on Luopo Mountain (Fallen Cliff Mountain), she had kept her grievances to herself. She had spent the entire day at the New Year’s Shop, perched on a stool, sulking and staring off into space.  

The source of her frustration was the idle gossip she had overheard around town.  

For years, Pei Qian had caught snippets of such gossip, but she had always brushed it off. After all, she was a “jianghu” (wandering martial artist) now, and a person of the jianghu had to be magnanimous. She had even recorded these slanders in a small notebook, hidden at the bottom of her bamboo chest, intending to settle accounts one day.  

But lately, with her master back on Luopo Mountain, the gossip had grown more malicious. In particular, people spoke ill of her master’s childhood—his struggles as a kiln apprentice in Dragon Kiln Town—and twisted the stories of those around him.  

They mocked Liu Xianyang, his friend; Song Jixin, his neighbor; and even Ruan Xiu, his benefactor. They claimed Chen Ping’an’s success was due to currying favor with Ruan Xiu or that he had improper relations with Gu Can’s mother, the widow. Some even accused him of borrowing money from Song Jixin and never repaying it.  

Each time Pei Qian returned to the New Year’s Shop, she would take out her notebook and furiously jot down the offenders’ names, her quill pressing so hard that the ink bled through the pages. If not for her master’s presence on the mountain, she might have already confronted them, regardless of their age or gender.  

Stone Soft (Shi Rou) had noticed her anger one day and tried to comfort her. “Gossip is everywhere, whether in the streets or on the grand stage of the jianghu. Few people truly wish others well. To your face, they’ll flatter you, but behind your back, they’ll talk. It’s just how people are.”  

Pei Qian had retorted, “I don’t care what they say about me, but no one gets to insult my master!”  

Shi Rou had been at a loss, worried Pei Qian’s temper would one day lead to trouble.  

But today, as Pei Qian watched her master listen so earnestly to the old woman’s ramblings, her anger and grievances seemed to dissipate.  

She remembered a time when she had accompanied her master to his parents’ graves. On the way back, they had encountered this same old woman bringing offerings to the gravesite.  

Pei Qian popped another sunflower seed into her mouth and grinned.  

She decided not to burden her master with her troubles.  

And from now on, she resolved to be kinder to this “Aunt Chen.”  

---  

After leaving the Grasshead Shop, Chen Ping’an didn’t take Pei Qian straight back to the New Year’s Shop. Instead, they wandered through Qilong Alley, climbing the stairs and weaving through the town’s streets and alleys. Eventually, they reached the ancestral home of Liu Xianyang.  

Chen Ping’an unlocked the door and began sweeping.  

Pei Qian was no stranger to this place. Years ago, when they parted ways in Red Candle Town, her master had entrusted her with a set of keys, one of which belonged to this house. Occasionally, she and the pink-dress girl would come by to clean it.  

But today was different. Without needing to consult a calendar, Pei Qian felt brimming with energy. She fetched a bucket and cloth, drawing water from the cistern to wipe down the furniture.  

As they worked, Chen Ping’an told her stories of his childhood adventures with Liu Xianyang—hunting, crafting slingshots, catching fish and birds.  

When he fell silent, Pei Qian recited a set of precepts she had memorized somewhere:  

“Rise with the rooster’s crow, sweep the courtyard, keep the home tidy. Lock the doors, inspect them personally… A morsel of food, think of its source… Tools, plain but clean; a clay pot surpasses gold and jade. Do favors without expecting return; receive favors without forgetting them…”  

Chen Ping’an listened with a smile, curious but not pressing for details.  

When they finished their chores, the two sat on the doorstep to rest.  

“Master, were you really that close with Liu Xianyang?” Pei Qian asked.  

“Of course,” Chen Ping’an replied with a nod. “Back then, I was his little tagalong. And later, we had another kid following us around—a little snot-nosed brat. The three of us were inseparable.”  

Pei Qian hesitated for a long moment before asking softly, “Master, if someone speaks ill of you, do you get angry?”  

Chen Ping’an chuckled. “Not if they say it to my face. And if it’s behind my back… still no.”  

“Not even a little?” Pei Qian frowned. “Even mud Buddhas have tempers, don’t they? How come you don’t get mad?”  

Chen Ping’an patted her head. “Because getting angry won’t change anything.”  

Pei Qian handed him a handful of sunflower seeds. “But just letting them badmouth you doesn’t feel right, Master.”  

Chen Ping’an leaned back, cracking a seed. “Do you want the big answer or the small one?”  

“Both!” she grinned.  

“Alright then. The big one first. What we say and do every day—do you think it’s just words and actions? No, it’s more than that. Each word and action is like a thread, weaving together to form the river of our life. This river, hidden in our hearts, determines our joys and sorrows, our triumphs and failures.  

“If we’re careless, the river might dry up—or worse, flood, destroying everything in its path. That’s why the sages teach us to reflect on ourselves and to restrain our tempers. There’s even a famous scholar in Tongyezhou who hung a plaque in his study with the words *‘Master Your Anger.’* If we can do that, our hearts won’t be consumed by floods of rage, and we’ll have a clear path forward.”  

Pei Qian nodded slowly, though her brow furrowed in thought. “And the small answer?”  

Chen Ping’an smiled. “The small answer is simple. When you’re poor, people will talk. There’s nothing you can do except bear it. But when you’re well-off, others will envy you. So what if they say a few sour words? Their gossip won’t take away your blessings, but it might cost them their own. Thinking like that, doesn’t it feel a little less upsetting?”  

Pei Qian mulled it over, arms crossed. Eventually, she nodded. “It still makes me mad, but not as much.”  

Chen Ping’an laughed. “It’s natural to feel angry. But if you can hold back from lashing out, from using someone else’s small mistake as an excuse for a big one, then you’ve already done well.”  

Pei Qian’s face lit up. “Master! I’ve heard so many bad things, but I haven’t hit anyone! Not even once!”  

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Well done. Consider this your verbal commendation.”  

“Can I get a copper coin reward, too?” she asked cheekily.  

He shook his head, amused. “Life isn’t a balance sheet. You don’t always get something back for doing the right thing. But since you’ve chosen me as your master, you’ll have to learn to accept that.”  

Pei Qian grinned. “That’s not so bad.”  

Chen Ping’an glanced at her hand, where she was carefully gathering her sunflower seed shells, just as he did. Without a word, he tipped his own shells into her hand.  

“Someday,” he said, “you’ll meet people who’ll criticize you for something as small as where you toss your sunflower seed shells. These people come in two kinds: those born into privilege, who’ve never known hardship, and those who’ll spend their whole lives in alleys like Qilong Alley. Be especially careful of the second type. The first are arrogant, but the second… they have rotten hearts.”  

Pei Qian’s eyes widened. “People would really scold someone over sunflower seed shells? What about all the chicken poop and dog crap on the streets? What kind of world is this?”  

Chen Ping’an didn’t explain further. Some truths were still too big for her to carry.  

Instead, he said, “I tell you this because I don’t want you to stew in anger alone. I want you to understand that the world is full of such people. And though you may not like them, in some ways, they might be better than you.  

“That’s why we need to keep learning about the world, step by step.”  

Pei Qian scratched her head. “Master, my brain hurts.”  

Chen Ping’an chuckled, ruffling her hair. “Just remember the gist of it. As you wander the jianghu, keep your eyes and mind open. And don’t hesitate to act when you see real injustice.”  

She hesitated before asking timidly, “Master, if I don’t wander too far, will you still buy me a little donkey to ride?”  

He laughed. “Of course.”  

Pei Qian beamed with relief.  

“Master, how far do you think I should go on my first journey?”  

Chen Ping’an raised an eyebrow. “At least make it to Red Candle Town, alright?”  

She sighed with relief again. “No problem! I’ll pack plenty of dry rations and sunflower seeds!”  

Chen Ping’an flicked her forehead.  

“Ow!” She winced, quickly catching her seed shells to keep them from dropping.  

He stood, locked the door, and led her out of the alley.  

As they walked, he picked up a tree branch from the roadside.  

When they reached a quiet spot, Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “Let’s see your ‘Heavenly Blossom Scatter’ technique.”  

Pei Qian’s eyes lit up. She clutched her sunflower seed shells and nodded eagerly. “Ready, Master!”  

Chen Ping’an stood with one hand behind his back, the branch in his other hand.  

With a soft cry, Pei Qian tossed the shells into the air.  

Chen Ping’an didn’t move, but his blue robe stirred as if caught in an invisible breeze.  

Then, in a blur of motion, he stepped forward, leaving only a faint blue afterimage behind. One by one, the sunflower seed shells exploded mid-air, pierced by the tip of his “sword.”  

When he came to a stop, the air around him seemed to ripple, forming the faint image of a swordsman mid-strike.  

Pei Qian clapped her hands together in awe. “Master! That technique is even better than my ‘Mad Demon Swordplay!’ Incredible!”  

Chen Ping’an tossed the branch aside, laughing. “That *is* your ‘Mad Demon Swordplay.’”  

She blinked. “But it didn’t hit you! Is that even possible?”  

He couldn’t help but laugh. After a moment’s thought, he decided to indulge in a bit of fun.  

“Watch closely,” he said. “Here’s another move.”  

Pei Qian immediately took a deep breath, assuming a stance as if to absorb the lesson.  

Chen Ping’an glanced at the discarded branch, then flicked his fingers. The branch shot into the air, curving like a flying sword.  

As it embedded itself into a distant wall, Pei Qian burst into laughter.  

“Master, you’re copying me!” she teased.  

Chen Ping’an laughed along with her.  

On their way back to Qilong Alley, Pei Qian ran ahead to retrieve the branch, declaring it a priceless treasure.  

After dropping her off at the New Year’s Shop, Chen Ping’an exchanged goodbyes with Aunt Chen and Stone Soft before heading back to Luopo Mountain.  

Pei Qian followed him to the alley’s entrance and waved until he nodded back. Only then did she swagger back inside, holding the branch aloft like a trophy.  

“Stone Soft Sister!” she called. “Can you guess what this treasure is?”  

Stone Soft looked at the branch and smiled. “I’m afraid I can’t.”  

Pei Qian sighed dramatically. “It’s just a branch, of course!”  

Stone Soft shook her head, laughing.  

---  

At the far end of the alley, Chen Ping’an paused and looked back.  

Years ago, on another street in the rain, he had walked alongside someone else.  

“Chen Ping’an, having a pure heart doesn’t mean being naive. It means knowing how complex the world is—understanding human nature, rules, and principles—and still choosing to be good. Even if life proves that goodness doesn’t always bring rewards, you accept the consequences.  

“Do you understand?”  

“Yes, Mr. Qi!”  

“Can you do it?”  

“I’m not sure yet.”  

“That’s fine. Take your time.”  

Now, standing alone in his green robe, Chen Ping’an murmured to himself, “I’ve taken my time. I can’t go any slower.”  

He closed his eyes.  

At the Dragon Spring County’s Martial Temple, the deity’s statue trembled.  

The entire county seemed to respond. Doors adorned with martial guardian deities glowed with golden light, and the temple’s divine aura surged like a waterfall.  

On Luopo Mountain, Wei Bo and the old barefoot man appeared on the balcony.  

“What’s happening?” Wei Bo asked.  

The old man snorted. “A mere fifth-realm breakthrough. Nothing worth mentioning.”  

Wei Bo sighed internally. If it was so trivial, why couldn’t the old man hide his grin?  

Suddenly, the old man’s expression grew serious. “Kid, don’t hold back. A martial artist, a sword cultivator—no matter how reasonable you are, you need to have some spirit, don’t you?”  

Wei Bo quickly adjusted the mountain’s energy flow to conceal the outburst.  

Meanwhile, at the alley’s end, Chen Ping’an’s sword floated from its scabbard, the tip resting lightly on the ground beside him.  

Placing his hand on the hilt, he looked into the distance. “Whether to accept this fortune is my choice. But refusing it? That’s not an option.”  

With a flick of his will, the sword returned to its sheath.  

A brilliant beam of light shot from the Martial Temple, splitting into smaller streams before converging on Chen Ping’an.  

He caught it all with one hand, compressing it into a radiant pearl.  

As he stepped into the New Year’s Shop, Stone Soft cowered under the overwhelming pressure of his aura. Only Pei Qian stood there, baffled.  

Chen Ping’an placed the glowing pearl in her hands.  

“Catch,” he said with a smile.  

Pei Qian stared at the pearl, her eyes sparkling like twin suns.  

As it vanished into her palm, she hiccupped.  

“Master, what was that?” she asked, wide-eyed.  

“One of my principles,” Chen Ping’an replied.  

Pei Qian patted her stomach. “It was delicious! Do you have more?”  

Chen Ping’an tugged her ear with a laugh. “What do you think?”  

She grinned. “Maybe, maybe not. It’s fine either way.”  

---  

Back on Luopo Mountain, Chen Ping’an found the old man waiting.  

“Come inside,” the old man said gruffly. “Let this sixth-realm ‘grandmaster’ see what the tenth realm looks like.”  

Wei Bo wisely made himself scarce.  

Chen Ping’an sighed, resigned to his fate.  

Meanwhile, Pei Qian sat on her stool in the shop, idly playing with a talisman.  

“Scaredy-cat,” she teased Stone Soft, sticking the talisman to her own forehead for effect.  

Stone Soft didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.  

At the alley’s far end, Chen Ping’an turned back once more, as if seeing his past self walking toward him in the rain.  

He smiled faintly and continued on his way.  

 ### Chapter 535: The Chirp of a Bird, as if Inviting Guests (Part 1)

Today, Zhu Lian’s courtyard was unusually lively. Wei Bo hadn’t left Luopo Mountain and had come instead to play a game of chess with Zhu Lian.

On the table were two exquisite chess jars, palace-crafted antiques Chen Ping’an had acquired during his travels. While not exactly a bargain, they were delightful to look at. Upon his return to Luopo Mountain, he gifted them to Zhu Lian. Wei Bo, a skilled chess player, often came by to challenge Zhu Lian. Zhu Lian himself, though he used to feign mediocrity by watching Sui Youbian and Lu Baixiang play and pretending to be a half-competent amateur, had an impressive skill level hidden beneath the surface. It wasn’t so much a case of him hiding his abilities, but rather that he never regarded Sui or Lu as equals. Of course, it was likely that the two thought even less of Zhu Lian.

Zheng Dafeng, though his martial path had been permanently severed due to injuries sustained in Old Dragon City, still retained his sharp instincts. Guessing that some commotion must have been caused by Chen Ping’an, he quickly hurried up from the foot of the mountain.

Nearby, the boy in green and the girl in pink were spectating the chess game. The boy was offering nonsensical advice to Zhu Lian, who didn’t care much about winning or losing. Whenever the boy suggested a move, Zhu Lian would comply without hesitation, turning an evenly matched game into one of disadvantage, then inevitably into a loss. The girl in pink, who upheld the principle of “a true observer does not speak,” grew visibly anxious and started scolding the boy for spouting nonsense. As the embodiment of the scholarly spirit of the Cao family’s library, she had spent centuries reading to pass the time after gaining sentience. While she wouldn’t claim to be a national-level chess master, she could easily discern the flow of a game.

Cen Yuanji, taking a break from her martial practice, also came over to join the fun. She found Wei Bo, with his divine demeanor, quite likable. It couldn’t be helped—Wei Bo was simply too good-looking. Cen Yuanji’s fondness for him wasn’t romantic; she merely felt that every additional glance at such a beautiful sight was a reward in itself, like appreciating a scenic painting—purely a feast for the eyes.

What the young girl didn’t realize was that on this mountain, aside from the eccentric and intimidating young mountain lord, the “immortal” Zhu Lian she trusted so much wasn’t merely a peak Sixth Realm martial artist but an actual Wandering Realm (Far-Traveled) expert. The hunchbacked man, whom she called Brother Dafeng, had once been a Mountain Peak Realm powerhouse. As for the barefoot old man in the bamboo building, he was a legendary Terminus Realm martial artist. The eighth, ninth, and tenth realms were all represented on this mountain.

Under the "helpful" interference of the boy in green, Zhu Lian lost the game without any suspense, much to the girl in pink’s frustration. The boy in green glanced at the disastrous board, where Zhu Lian’s dragon had been slaughtered, and clicked his tongue. "Old Chef Zhu, one move down, yet your defeat is still honorable!"

Zhu Lian nodded, raising his arm. "Indeed. Next time, let us strive harder—united as brothers, our strength can break through gold."

The boy in green beamed, quickly massaging Zhu Lian’s arm after the latter raised it. "Old chef, you might not realize it, but these hands of mine carry immortal energy! Isn’t that right, Wei Bo?"

The boy reminisced about the time he had clapped the Daoist Master Lu Chen on the shoulder with both hands. If word of that reached the White Jade Capital, no matter how exalted the immortals and celestial lords were, who wouldn’t give him a thumbs-up and call him a hero?

Wei Bo smiled faintly. "Getting a little cocky again, aren’t we?"

The boy in green rolled his eyes, making no effort to hide his grievances against Wei Bo, the Northern Mountain God of Dali. Back when he had tried to secure a "Peaceful Times" talisman plaque for his river god brother in Huangting Kingdom, he had faced rejection at every turn, especially from Wei Bo, whose cold indifference had been particularly demoralizing. As a result, whenever there was a chess match, the boy in green would always take Zhu Lian’s side, cheering him on or offering exaggerated flattery, hoping Zhu Lian would muster all his strength to crush Wei Bo. He even fantasized about seeing Wei Bo humiliated, begging for mercy, and swearing never to touch a chess piece again.

Needless to say, with the boy in green present, any chess match between Zhu Lian and Wei Bo was anything but tranquil and refined.

Suddenly, Zhu Lian asked, "Have the two of you truly decided?"

The boy in green raised his nose to the sky and snorted. "If we don’t act quickly, we’ll fall into Chen Ping’an’s clutches!"

The girl in pink nodded gently.

As it turned out, they had both chosen names for themselves—not their true names, but ones Chen Ping’an had suggested could someday be inscribed in the ancestral hall’s genealogy.

The boy in green had named himself Chen Lingjun, while the girl in pink had chosen Chen Ruchu.

Zheng Dafeng teased, "Chen Lingjun? What kind of name is that? I think we should just call you Little Greenie—it’s easier to say."

The boy in green wasn’t one to take insults lying down. "Brother Dafeng, you don’t know squat."

Zheng Dafeng chuckled. "Oh, but I know you."

The boy in green snapped, "Stop yapping! If you’ve got the guts, let’s settle this on the chessboard!"

Wei Bo smirked. "Bringing shame upon yourself?"

Zheng Dafeng, rubbing his hands together in anticipation, said, "How about a little wager? But since your chess skills are better, you’ll need to give me an advantage—let’s say, two handicap stones. Otherwise, I’m not playing."

The boy in green frowned, suspicious. "Two stones? Isn’t that looking down on you, Brother Dafeng? How about just one?"

Wei Bo burst out laughing.

Zhu Lian slapped his forehead. Zheng Dafeng had dug such an obvious pit, and yet the boy in green enthusiastically jumped right into it.

Zheng Dafeng, suppressing his laughter, decided against bullying the naive lad. He waved his hand dismissively. "Forget it, we’ll talk about it later."

Zheng Dafeng’s chess skills were simple to gauge: whenever Zhu Lian and Wei Bo played, whichever side Zheng Dafeng supported would inevitably win.

Although it might be an exaggeration to call Zheng Dafeng profoundly wise, he undoubtedly had a place among the most intelligent figures of Lijiao Dongtian in his youth.

The boy in green glanced at the girl in pink, who shook her head gently. Only then did he realize—damn it, Zheng Dafeng was pretty sly himself! He’d almost tarnished his own reputation.

Cen Yuanji quietly left to continue her martial practice, typically choosing the serene green hills and clear waters of Luopo Mountain during the day for her six-step walking postures. At night, she would train in the courtyard, staying close to Zhu Lian’s residence to feel safer. That way, if someone dared to harass her, at least she wouldn’t be left helpless.

The boy in green glanced at the sky and decided to visit the shop in the nearby town to play with Pei Qian. The girl in pink followed, bowing to Zhu Lian and the others as she left, saying she needed to stock up on sunflower seeds.

After Cen Yuanji and the two little ones departed, Zheng Dafeng remarked, "With this breakthrough, it’s time to head down the mountain again. Youth is such a joy—no matter how busy you are, you never feel tired."

Zhu Lian laughed. "Brother Dafeng, you’re still young, and handsome too. All you’re missing is a wife."

Zheng Dafeng raised his hands in mock surrender. "Old Brother Zhu, such blunt truths are best left unsaid—you’ll make people hate you."

"I’d say you and Wei Bo played no small part in Chen Ping’an’s eagerness to travel."

Wei Bo stood up with a smile. "I have to prepare for the Night Banquet. Just ten days to go—it’ll be quite the noisy affair and a headache to manage."

The courtyard returned to its usual tranquility.  

Zhu Lian began tidying up the chessboard while Zheng Dafeng sat in Wei Bo’s previous spot, helping to put the pieces back into the jars.

Zhu Lian mused, "Care to guess? After my young master’s breakthrough, will he come to talk with you? And if he does, how will he begin?"

Zheng Dafeng replied, "He’ll probably come find me at the mountain’s base, trying to ease my mind so I don’t feel awkward. But it won’t be a long chat—maybe just some drinking. Honestly, I wish the kid wouldn’t bother looking for me at all. Look at how few people there are on Luopo Mountain right now, and he’s already running himself ragged. When the mountain grows larger and gains more disciples, will he even have time to cultivate? Old Brother Zhu, you’re the best at giving advice. If you get the chance, you should have a heart-to-heart with Chen Ping’an."

Zhu Lian sighed as he put away the chess pieces. "That won’t be easy."

(End of Part 1)

 ### Chapter 536: The Chirping Bird, a Subtle Farewell (Part 2)

The round-faced girl nicknamed "Jiu'er" had a unique bloodline that could serve as an exceptional "Talisman Spring" for the Talisman Sect. This peculiarity left her face perpetually pale. Over the years, however, "Little Limp," once a small boy with a noticeable limp, had grown into a robust young man. Similarly, Jiu'er had shot up in height, her once chubby cheeks now slimmer and rosier. She had blossomed into a slender and graceful young woman.

Li Baoping, during her last visit to the Cliff Academy, had shared with Chen Ping'an how much she missed Jiu'er. Back in the day, the two young girls—Li Baoping in her red cotton jacket and Jiu'er—had hit it off instantly.

When they reunited after seven years, neither "Little Limp" nor Jiu'er immediately recognized Chen Ping'an. The boy they had once known, who wielded a hatchet to clear paths and wore straw sandals, had transformed into a composed young man in a green robe, carrying a sword on his back. Even though his health had improved during his stay on Fallen Peak Mountain (Luopo Shan), he still appeared slightly gaunt. Thankfully, his cheeks no longer bore the sunken hollows they had during his time at Book Slip Lake (Shujian Hu). Otherwise, the two disciples of the blind Daoist might not have dared to acknowledge him at all.

Once they confirmed his identity, the blind Daoist elder broke into a broad grin. Chen Ping'an, ever amiable, asked if they had eaten yet. Upon learning they hadn't, he immediately invited them to the busiest tavern in town for a meal.

---

### Over Drinks at the Tavern

The blind Daoist sipped his wine, stroking his beard with a smile. "Young Master Chen, how come Miss Ruan no longer stays at the shop?"

Years ago, when they parted ways, Chen Ping'an had told them they could seek out Ruan Xiu on Riding Dragon Alley (Qilong Xi) if they ever found themselves in town. However, at the time, the blind Daoist had no intention of settling down; he was determined to make a name for himself in the capital of the Dali Empire. Yet the capital, teeming with hidden dragons and crouching tigers, proved impenetrable for the three of them. The Daoist, unwilling to expose Jiu'er's unique bloodline, found them unable to rise above their modest circumstances. Over the years, all they managed to earn was a few thousand taels of silver—a fortune for ordinary households but mere pocket change for cultivators. The blind Daoist, dejected, had been forced to abandon his lofty ambitions.

During their time in the capital, fragmented rumors about events in the Dragon Spring County (Longquan Jun) reached the Daoist's ears. Although he couldn't afford the celestial bulletins from the immortal taverns, he pieced together enough scraps of gossip to realize something startling: the young shopkeeper's assistant, Ruan Xiu, might very well be the daughter of the Sage Ruan Qiong himself!

This revelation left the Daoist too embarrassed—and somewhat afraid—to return to the town. After all, "Little Limp" had a dubious past, and the Daoist worried about causing offense. So, they lingered in the capital for a few more years. Eventually, unable to endure their struggles any longer, they decided to return to Dragon Spring County to try their luck. Unexpectedly, fate smiled upon them, and they ran into Chen Ping'an on their way back.

However, the Daoist's heart was clouded with uncertainty. Their relationship with Chen Ping'an had always been tenuous, a fleeting encounter at best. Although the blind Daoist drank and reminisced with a carefree demeanor, inwardly, he was nervously chanting: *Chen Ping'an, please invite us to stay. Even a polite offer will suffice. Once you extend an olive branch, I’ll gladly accept. Surely, someone with ties to the Sage's family wouldn’t begrudge us a few celestial coins, right?*

But from beginning to end, despite the nostalgic conversation over wine, Chen Ping'an never broached the topic. He refrained from asking if the Daoist and his disciples wanted to settle in Dragon Spring County.

---

### The Farewell

Upon leaving the tavern, the two groups stood outside on the bustling street. Only then did Chen Ping'an say, "I currently reside on Fallen Peak Mountain. It's a small mountain of my own. If you pass by Dragon Spring County in the future, you're welcome to visit. I might not be there, but just mention your Daoist title, and someone will surely receive you. By the way, Miss Ruan now resides on Divine Elegance Mountain (Shenxiu Shan), home to her family's Dragon Spring Sword Sect. I recently returned from my travels, and during a chat with her, she mentioned you and hasn’t forgotten you. Feel free to visit her when you have the time."

The blind Daoist's face lit up with joy. "Of course, of course!"

Chen Ping'an turned to "Little Limp" and Jiu'er, smiling gently. "Take care on your journey. I hope our next meeting won’t take as long as this one."

"Little Limp," carrying a large banner, nodded solemnly. Jiu'er smiled and nodded as well.

Standing beside Chen Ping'an, Pei Qian cupped her fists and declared in a tone far too mature for her age, "The green mountains never change, and the flowing waters run long. Until we meet again!"

With that, the Daoist and his two disciples departed, heading toward Red Candle Town (Hongzhu Zhen) in the distance.

---

### Wisdom and Restraint

Chen Ping'an remained standing in place, watching their silhouettes fade into the horizon.

Pei Qian softly called, "Master?"

Chen Ping'an ruffled her hair and said, "I would have liked to keep them around. But making a living isn’t easy, and people often take for granted things that come too easily. If they can’t bring themselves to ask for help, it means they’re not truly desperate to stay in Dragon Spring County. And if they do stay, it would mean a long-term commitment, sharing days and nights together. It’s better to start on the same page rather than ending up in a situation where I think I’m doing them a favor, but they see it as a burden. That would make it impossible to part ways amicably should things go wrong."

He sighed. "Of course, I could be overthinking it. That’s why I’ll ask Wei Bo to keep an eye on them. If they truly face hardships they can’t overcome or find themselves in dire straits but refuse to ask for help, I’ll send you to bring them back."

Pei Qian nodded, not fully understanding but trusting her master’s judgment. She then asked curiously, "Master, why did you talk so much about Sister Xiu to them?"

Chen Ping'an smiled. "Because I still hope they’ll decide to stay."

Pei Qian tilted her head, trying to unravel the logic behind her master’s words. After a moment, she gave up, sighing dramatically. "Forget it. Today’s not a day for thinking."

Then, lowering her voice, she added, "That old Daoist’s eyes—they were blinded by a sliver of lightning running wild in his body, weren’t they?"

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Thunder arts are revered as the pinnacle of all techniques. But here in Bottle Gourd Continent (Baoping Zhou), aside from the Divine Mandate Sect (Shen Gao Zong) and a few great celestial clans, most so-called Five Thunder True Arts are fragmented and incomplete. Practicing them often leads to backlash. Over time, practitioners might face physical decay, collapse of their Dao, or other misfortunes. Some lose their sight, others their internal organs, and some even see their life-bound treasures corrode. Few who practice these offshoot thunder arts meet a good end."

Pei Qian stuck out her tongue. "Cultivation sounds awful."

Chen Ping'an chuckled. "It’s not all about enjoying blessings."

Pei Qian nodded earnestly. "That’s why I won’t cultivate. I’ll just focus on martial arts!"

Chen Ping'an tugged at her ear playfully.

"Oww! Master, I promise I’ll train harder on my stances and endure more hardship!"

---

### The Old Schoolhouse

Later, Chen Ping'an brought Pei Qian to an old schoolhouse. Standing outside, Pei Qian tiptoed to rest her chin on the windowsill, peeking inside.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Have you decided? Do you want to attend the school run by the Chen clan at Dragon Tail Creek?"

Pei Qian didn’t move, her voice muffled. "If you want me to go, I’ll go. No one will gang up on me or call me ‘Black Charcoal’ or make fun of my short height…"

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but laugh. "If you really don’t want to go, you can stay on the mountain and study with Zhu Lian or Zheng Dafeng. They’re both great teachers. But I still think you should give the school a try. Who knows? You might end up loving it so much that you won’t want to leave. And if you still feel uncomfortable after a while, you can always come back."

Pei Qian asked hesitantly, "Can I bring my sword and practice in school?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "No. School is for studying—you need to follow their rules."

This was non-negotiable. As much as he doted on Pei Qian, some boundaries had to be drawn. A child’s innocence and whims might be endearing, but it was the responsibility of an elder to set firm foundations during their formative years.

Pei Qian stayed silent.

Chen Ping'an added, "There’s no rush. Think about it and decide before I leave the mountain."

Pei Qian finally spoke, her voice small. "If I go to the school, will you stay?"

Chen Ping'an pressed a hand gently to her head, gazing into the old schoolhouse without a word.

---

### Parting Shadows

Children’s small sorrows are like mist, fleeting and intangible.

Later, Chen Ping'an bought her a string of candied hawthorns. As they walked back to Fallen Peak Mountain, Pei Qian’s mood had already brightened. She chatted away, full of questions and laughter.

Meanwhile, the blind Daoist, buoyed by Chen Ping'an’s words, told his disciples, "We just need to wander for another year or so. Then we’ll return to Dragon Spring County and make our mark."

Not long after the Daoist and his disciples left, a pair of travelers arrived at Fallen Peak Mountain. A man and a woman, they had spent the past five or six years journeying across the Bottle Gourd Continent, from the southeastern Azure Luan Kingdom (Qingluan Guo) to the northern Dali Empire.

The man was Liu Qingshan, a scholar from Lion Garden (Shizi Yuan) in Azure Luan Kingdom. The woman was Liu Boqi, a Daoist nun from the Hanging Mountain’s (Daoxuan Shan) Blade Chamber (Shi Dao Fang). Liu Boqi carried a blade named "Fierce Spirit" (Jing Shen), ranked seventeenth among the chamber’s tools, as well as a life-bound blade named "Jia Zuo."

Chen Ping'an greeted them warmly but maintained a polite distance. His relationship with Liu Boqi was complicated—they had met under less-than-friendly circumstances and were far from friends. However, he got along well with Liu Qingshan, and the two quickly fell into lively conversation.

### A Visitor’s Insight

Liu Boqi, who had always been domineering back in Lion Garden, was noticeably more restrained on Fallen Peak Mountain. For one, Chen Ping'an seemed even more enigmatic than before. Secondly, Zhu Lian, the hunchbacked old steward, exuded an air of palpable danger. Lastly, the bamboo building on the mountain radiated an extraordinary aura, especially on its second floor.

Chen Ping'an gave the pair a tour of the mountain, including the ancestral shrine at the summit. Liu Qingshan mentioned they were here not only to visit Chen Ping'an but also to secure good vantage points for the upcoming Night Parade of Spirits, a grand celestial gathering. They also planned to visit Forest Deer Academy (Linlu Shuyuan) on Cloud-Piercing Mountain (Piyun Shan).

Chen Ping'an readily agreed, promising to arrange suitable viewing spots for them at the academy.

Later, however, Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but notice something odd—Liu Boqi had taken to addressing Zhu Lian as "Mr. Zhu" with uncharacteristic sincerity.

On their way back to the mountain, Chen Ping'an asked Zhu Lian about it.

Zhu Lian chuckled. "I just threw out a casual line from a book, and she took it to heart."

Curious, Chen Ping'an pressed, "What did you say?"

Pointing to a verdant mountain peak, Zhu Lian recited, "I see the green hills as charming, and I imagine they see me the same."

Chen Ping'an was momentarily stunned before bursting into laughter. "You old fox! That’s exactly the kind of thing someone like Liu Boqi would fall for."

He clapped Zhu Lian on the shoulder. "You’re a real veteran at this!"

Zhu Lian replied solemnly, "Not at all. A young phoenix’s song surpasses the old phoenix’s croon."

### Farewell Once More

Late one night, Chen Ping'an slipped away to the Oxhorn Mountain Immortal Ferry.

Pei Qian knew he was leaving but pretended not to. Though she missed him deeply, she found it easier to bear this time. Still, her heart felt a little empty.

For the first time, she turned to an almanac and discovered that the day her master left was auspicious for long journeys.

---

### Reunions and Anticipations

Liu Qingshan and Liu Boqi temporarily settled at Forest Deer Academy, awaiting the Night Parade of Spirits. Meanwhile, over in Red Candle Town, another reunion was taking place.

Li Baoping, now a refined and serene young woman, crossed paths with Jiu'er once more. The fiery girl who had once worn a red cotton jacket was now composed and studious, her beauty and grace blossoming with each passing year.

Standing atop Chess Mound Mountain (Qidun Shan), she gazed into the distance, lost in thought. Overhead, the cry of a bird pierced the sky. She tilted her head to look up.

The books had a saying: *"The bird’s cry is a gentle farewell, calling the immortal to roam the clouds."*

### A Traveler in the Rain

In the drizzling rain, somewhere in the central region of Bottle Gourd Continent, near Rouge County (Yanzhi Jun), a young man in a green robe, wearing a bamboo hat and carrying a sword, made his way southward.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 537: Journeying to the Ancestral Hall on Sword**

The young swordsman in the green robe, with a sword strapped to his back, once again traversed the familiar low mountain range during his travels through the nation of Colorful Garb (Caiyi). Compared to years before, when he roamed these lands with Zhang Shanfeng, the once desolate and eerie ghost-infested valleys were now clear of all sinister energy. Though it could not be called a haven of spiritual energy, the verdant mountains and flowing rivers were infinitely better than the bleak wasteland of the past.

Guided by memory, he journeyed onward, eventually arriving at a familiar ancient estate under the cover of night. Two stone lions still guarded the entrance, though the scene had changed slightly. Spring couplets now adorned the doorframe, and brightly painted door guardians were pasted on the gates.

After knocking on the door, he waited patiently.

A hunched old lady, holding a lantern with trembling hands, slowly opened the door. She saw a tall yet somewhat thin young man, his face radiant with a bright smile as he removed his bamboo hat. A sword was strapped to his back, making him look like a wandering swordsman from a distant land.

The old lady’s face turned pale—his sudden appearance at such a late hour was indeed startling. However, she quickly composed herself, not wanting to frighten her visitor. After all, the estate had long since weathered its trials and even come out stronger because of them. There was no longer any need to intentionally scare away mundane travelers or scholars for fear of them bringing misfortune upon themselves.

In a soft voice, she asked, "Young master, are you here to seek lodging?"

The young man chuckled. "Not only lodging, but I’m also here to ask for wine—and a hearty bowl of stir-fried winter bamboo shoots with pork to accompany it."

The old lady froze, her eyes welling up with tears. Her voice trembled as she asked, "Could it be… Chen Gongzi?"

Indeed, the visitor was none other than Chen Ping’an, traveling south alone.

Chen Ping’an smiled gently. "Old grandma, how has your health been?"

The old lady grabbed his hand tightly, as if afraid this benefactor would vanish the moment she let go. Wiping her tears with the back of her lantern-holding hand, she spoke with a mix of joy and grievance, "Why did it take you so long to come back? So many years have passed, and this frail old body couldn’t hold on much longer. I’ve been saving wine for you every year, thinking you’d return any day now—there’s plenty stocked up, no matter how much you drink. And the bamboo shoots and pork, I’ll prepare them right away…"

Chen Ping’an tucked his bamboo hat under his arm and gently held the old lady’s hands, his expression apologetic. "Grandma, I’m sorry I came so late."

The old lady turned and shouted into the house, "Master, madam, Chen Gongzi is here! He’s really here!"

Years ago, Yang Huang—a man willing to become a ghost slave to save his wife—rushed to the door with his wife, who now radiated health and vitality. Dressed in a scholar’s robe, Yang Huang and his wife hurried to greet Chen Ping’an. The couple immediately knelt to pay their respects, overwhelmed with gratitude for his life-saving kindness.

Chen Ping’an tried to stop them, but the old lady held his arm firmly, insisting he accept their heartfelt gesture. Reluctantly, he acquiesced.

After the couple rose, the old lady finally let go of Chen Ping’an’s arm. Yang Huang and his wife exchanged a smile, their gazes lingering on Chen Ping’an. The once youthful boy had grown into a slender young man, his demeanor calm yet tinged with weariness. But now, more than ever, he truly looked like a sword immortal—an image that filled them with joy.

The group entered the house together, Chen Ping’an naturally helping to close the door behind them. Yang Huang and his wife shared a knowing smile, lightly scolding the old lady for letting their honored guest do such menial tasks. The old lady, however, brushed them off, insisting on heading to the kitchen to prepare a late-night meal. Chen Ping’an tried to dissuade her, saying it was too late, but she refused to listen. The wife chimed in, insisting on preparing a few dishes herself to make up for their inadequate hospitality.

Yang Huang led Chen Ping’an to the familiar sitting room, recounting stories of what had transpired after his departure. All of it was good news.

Yang Huang, who had nearly fallen into demonic cultivation, had now regained his path of cultivation. Though his delayed journey on the Dao meant his once-bright future as a golden core realm cultivator was no longer possible, he was content. Compared to the days when he was neither human nor ghost, his current life was worlds apart. Yang Huang had once been a promising talent in the Shen’gao Sect (Divine Edict Sect), nurtured with hopes of reaching the golden core stage. But for the sake of love, he willingly gave up his path to immortality—a decision he never regretted.

As for his wife, once imprisoned in an embroidered tower, her beauty had been restored, and her cultivation advanced even faster than her husband’s. She had broken through to a new level and could now leave her physical form in the tower while her spiritual form roamed freely, enjoying the seasons like an ordinary woman. No longer did she endure the torment of celestial winds and the constant battering of her soul.

Yang Huang inquired after Zhang Shanfeng, the young Daoist, and Xu Yuanxia, the bearded swordsman who had once traveled with Chen Ping’an. Chen Ping’an answered each question in turn. He also asked about the governor of Rouge County (Yanzhi Jun) and Liu Gaohua, the son of an official. Yang Huang shared all he knew, explaining that years ago, Governor Liu had been promoted to a regional inspector in Qingzhou, a region of Colorful Garb. His daughter had become a core disciple of the Divine Edict Sect, which likely played a role in his career advancement. As for Liu Gaohua, he had visited the estate twice in recent years. Once a carefree wanderer shirking responsibilities, he had begun to settle down. However, his recent examination results had been poor, leaving him only at the rank of a provincial scholar (juren). On his second visit, he drank heavily and complained, saying his father had given him an ultimatum: if he couldn’t pass the imperial exams, he might as well find a wife and settle down.

Chen Ping’an also asked about the Daoist cultivator known as Mr. Fisherman (Yu Weng). Yang Huang revealed that the old man had recently returned from a trip to the capital and was now in Rouge County. Interestingly, he had taken on a talented young female disciple named Zhao Luan. However, trouble loomed as a prominent cultivator in Colorful Garb had set his sights on Zhao Luan, hoping to take her as his own disciple. This cultivator had even promised generous gifts and extended an invitation for Mr. Fisherman to become a guest elder at his sect. So far, the old man had refused.

Chen Ping’an listened quietly before asking, "What’s the reputation of this cultivator, and what’s his cultivation level?"

Yang Huang, despite his years as a ghost slave, retained his sharp judgment as a once-prominent disciple of the Divine Edict Sect. He laughed casually, "I’d guess he’s grown a bit arrogant since reaching the Dragon Gate realm (Longmen) in recent years. His sect has become increasingly restless, recruiting disciples indiscriminately. Their reputation, once respectable, has now declined significantly."

Chen Ping’an nodded. "I see. I’ll look into it further."

Yang Huang smiled. "My information is mostly hearsay, so take it with a grain of salt."

Soon after, the meal was set. The wine was meticulously brewed, and the dishes were fragrant and flavorful. The old lady and the wife joined the table, as this household wasn’t bound by rigid formalities. Perhaps hoping Chen Ping’an would drink to his heart’s content, the old lady handed him a large wine bowl, while the others received traditional cups. Yang Huang even stood and poured a toast, prompting everyone else to rise as well.

Chen Ping’an held the wine bowl helplessly and said with a laugh, "If this is how you treat your guests, I might think twice before visiting again."

Yang Huang drained his cup and joked, "We’ll discuss that the next time you come."

Chen Ping’an downed his bowl of wine in one gulp. The old lady immediately grew anxious, worrying he would harm himself by drinking too fast. "Slow down, slow down! The wine’s not going anywhere."

Chen Ping’an chuckled. "Don’t worry, grandma. My tolerance has improved over the years. Tonight, I’ll drink as much as I want, and if I get drunk, I’ll just sleep it off."

The old lady poured him more wine while muttering, "No matter how good your tolerance is, drinking slowly will let you enjoy more."

Chen Ping’an nodded. "Alright, I’ll drink slower. I’ll listen to you, grandma."

As they ate and drank, Chen Ping’an shared stories of his travels. He spoke of leaving Colorful Garb for Comb Water Country (Shu Shui), then boarding an immortal ferry to Old Dragon City (Lao Long Cheng) via the Dragon Path (Zou Long Dao). From there, he took a cross-continental ferry to Hanging Mountain (Dao Xuan Shan), visited Tongye Continent, and finally returned to Old Dragon City. After a brief stop in Azure Luan Country, he returned to his hometown. However, he hesitated to mention Sword Qi Great Wall and Scroll Lake, skipping over them entirely. Instead, he recounted amusing anecdotes and intriguing incidents from his journey, captivating both Yang Huang and his wife. The old lady listened with rapt attention, whether the stories were about the wonders of the world or the trivialities of life.

That night, Chen Ping’an drank over two catties of wine—a generous amount. He stayed in the same room where he had lodged during his previous visit.

The next morning, he spent most of his time sitting in the courtyard with the old lady, basking in the sun and chatting leisurely. Though he had originally planned to leave on the third day, the old lady’s heartfelt pleas convinced him to stay an extra day.

At dawn, under a light autumn drizzle, Chen Ping’an donned his bamboo hat once more and bid farewell at the estate’s entrance. The old lady insisted he wear a green rain cape, arguing that the drizzle, though light, could still harm his health. Reluctantly, Chen Ping’an obliged. The old sword gourd, which had once revealed his identity as a sword immortal, was now filled with the estate’s homemade wine.

Before parting, the old lady stood under the eaves, holding his hand. "Don’t find me too naggy, alright? Otherwise, you won’t want to visit anymore."

Chen Ping’an spoke softly, "How could that be? I’ve missed your wine and food countless times over the years."

The old lady lowered her head, wiping her tears. "That’s good to hear. That’s good."

Adjusting his bamboo hat, Chen Ping’an bid her farewell and walked away slowly. After some distance, he suddenly turned around, walking backward to wave at the old lady and the couple.

The old lady called out, "Chen Gongzi, don’t forget next time—bring that Miss Ning with you when you visit!"

Chen Ping’an’s face reddened slightly. He yelled back, "Alright!"

Through the curtain of rain, the young man’s figure—bamboo hat and green rain cape—gradually disappeared into the distance.

The old lady, overcome with emotion, lingered at the door. Yang Huang, worried about her catching a chill in the autumn rain, gently urged her to return inside. She waited until Chen Ping’an’s figure was completely out of sight before finally heading back into the house.

Inside, Yang Huang’s wife, Yingying, called softly, "Husband?"

She hesitated, then apologized, "Forgive me for being so petty and worldly."

Her earlier thoughts—those fleeting, selfish desires—faded away as she murmured to herself, "How could we let Chen Gongzi be distracted by such trivial matters? You did well not to mention it. We truly shouldn’t be so insatiable."

Yang Huang took her hand, smiling. "You meant well."

Her mood brightened, and she smiled back. "Husband, good people will surely be rewarded, won’t they?"

Yang Huang replied, "I can’t speak for other good people, but I hope that Chen Ping’an will be."

Yingying beamed. "Suddenly, I feel happy just knowing that Chen Gongzi came to visit and drink with us."

Yang Huang nodded, his tone wistful. "This autumn feels as gentle as a spring breeze."

In the rain, Chen Ping’an took a slight detour to a newly established mountain god temple, formally recognized by Colorful Garb’s court. He stepped confidently inside.

It was early morning during the harvest season, and the temple—built on the ruins of a former illicit shrine—had no visitors.

Chen Ping’an removed his bamboo hat, shook off the rainwater, and crossed the threshold. He no longer concealed his aura or the intent of his fists.

The local mountain god immediately appeared in his divine form—a towering armored warrior stepping out of the temple’s painted idol. Nervous and uneasy, he clasped his hands in a respectful salute. "This humble god greets the immortal master."

Chen Ping’an smiled. "I apologize for the intrusion. I’m here to ask if any cultivators from nearby sects have shown interest in the spiritual energy of that estate."

Speaking in the official language of Dali rather than the regional dialects, Chen Ping’an’s words carried weight. The mountain god, caught off guard, struggled to compose an appropriate response. Before he could, the young sword immortal calmly put his bamboo hat back on. "Then I’ll trouble you to keep an eye out."

The mountain god, realizing the unspoken warning, quickly straightened his posture. "Rest assured, immortal master. This humble god considers Yang Huang and his family my neighbors, and as the saying goes, a distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor. I will take care of it."

Chen Ping’an clasped his hands in farewell, smiling. "Let’s pretend I was never here."

The mountain god nodded fervently, understanding the implications. One did not achieve such a coveted position through mere merit or luck; subtlety and intelligence were crucial in both divine and mortal hierarchies.

After leaving the temple, Chen Ping’an continued to Rouge County to meet Mr. Fisherman. Presenting his credentials at the city gates, he used a brand-new household registry, courtesy of Wei Bo, which still listed him as a native of Dali’s Longquan County. Following directions, he found Mr. Fisherman’s residence in a quiet alley where only the sound of rain could be heard.

Knocking on the door, he was soon greeted by a tall, thin young man with a solemn expression. The boy hesitated, seemingly unsure of Chen Ping’an’s identity.

Chen Ping’an smiled. "Zhao Shuxia?"

The boy's face lit up with surprise and joy. "Chen Sir!"

Chen Ping’an nodded, taking a moment to assess the boy. His martial aura was faint but pure, indicating he was still at the third stage of martial cultivation. He had a long way to go before breaking through, but his earnestness was evident. Though not a prodigy like Cen Yuanji, Zhao Shuxia possessed a certain steadfastness that Chen Ping’an admired. It seemed the boy had diligently practiced the six-step stance he had been taught years ago.

Zhao Shuxia, once a boy wielding a hatchet to protect a little girl, was now leading Chen Ping’an into the courtyard. Chen Ping’an teased, "Have you completed the one hundred thousand punches I assigned you back then?"

Zhao Shuxia scratched his head, embarrassed. "If one punch counts as one repetition, then I’ve done over one hundred sixty thousand punches. I’ve been training hard, but it’s just so slow."

Chen Ping’an asked, "Have you ever fought anyone or received guidance from an expert?"

Zhao Shuxia shook his head. "No."

Chen Ping’an understood. Without the crucible of life-and-death battles or expert mentorship, progress would naturally be slow. But he wasn’t worried. The boy’s dedication was like a steady stream filling a bowl—slow but certain. As long as the bowl remained upright, none of the water would spill.

In the courtyard, Mr. Fisherman, an elderly scholar, stood under the eaves with a girl of delicate features. Zhao Shuxia called out cheerfully, "Chen Sir is here!"

Chen Ping’an removed his bamboo hat and bowed slightly. "Greetings, Mr. Fisherman."

Then, turning to the girl, his smile softened. "Luan Luan, it’s been a long time."

The old scholar, Wu Shouwen, hesitated to recognize Chen Ping’an at first. The transformation was too great. Though many years had passed, it was difficult to reconcile the tall, refined young man before him with the bamboo-box-toting boy of the past.

But the girl, Zhao Luan, immediately burst into tears, crying and laughing at the same time as she called out, her voice trembling, "Chen Sir!"

For Zhao Luan, no amount of gratitude or longing for Chen Ping’an was excessive. Over the years, she had thought of him countless times. He was her anchor, her inspiration through every hardship and joy on her path of cultivation.

Her brother often teased her about it, but as she grew older, she learned to hide her feelings, fearing his jokes would only worsen.

Zhao Shuxia, usually reserved, showed his unguarded side only with his sister. He chuckled quietly, watching her reaction.

The four of them sat together. Back at the estate, it had been wine; here, it was tea. The tea, infused with threads of spiritual energy, was specially prepared to aid Zhao Luan’s cultivation. For those with exceptional talent like her, the resources required for training were immense.

Years ago, Wu Shouwen, a scholar and cultivator affiliated with the Confucian school, had joined Chen Ping’an in exorcising spirits in Rouge County. Chen Ping’an held the old scholar in high regard, entrusting him with the care of the Zhao siblings. Over the years, Wu Shouwen had proven himself worthy of that trust.

However, as Chen Ping’an’s experiences grew, so did his guilt. His once-naive acts of kindness might have brought unforeseen trouble to the old scholar. The higher one climbed in the cultivation world, the less freedom one had. Even in the mundane world, avoiding disputes didn’t guarantee peace.

For someone as gifted as Zhao Luan, the burden on Wu Shouwen was even greater. How could he ensure she received the training she deserved? How could he secure the resources she needed without compromising her safety?

These were questions Chen Ping’an hadn’t considered back then.

It was only after traveling thousands of miles and encountering countless people and events that he understood the challenges of being a "good person." Only then could he truly empathize with the world’s suffering.

Before entering Colorful Garb, Chen Ping’an had made a detour to Elmwood Country. There, he confronted the elm spirit who had become its national advisor—a longstanding enemy. Concerned that the spirit might still target the ancient estate, Chen Ping’an decided to act preemptively.

In the heart of the enemy’s territory, he found the elm spirit in its scholarly guise. Three punches were all it took to leave the spirit severely injured, erasing decades of cultivation progress. With two flying swords poised at its forehead and heart, Chen Ping’an asked if it still intended to pursue their vendetta. The answer was a bloodied, trembling "no."

Satisfied, Chen Ping’an left but lingered conspicuously at a roadside tea stall near the capital gates, awaiting any retaliation. None came.

Only then did he set off for Colorful Garb.

Sipping his tea, Chen Ping’an asked directly, "Mr. Wu, I heard a cultivator in Colorful Garb wants to take Luan Luan as a disciple?"

Wu Shouwen nodded, his expression troubled. "If this master genuinely intended to teach her, I would step aside, no matter how much it pained me. But half the reason for his interest lies elsewhere… His son, a debauched scoundrel, saw Luan Luan at a banquet in the capital and…" Wu Shouwen sighed deeply. "Such sordid matters aren’t worth repeating. If worst comes to worst, I’ll take Luan Luan and Shuxia far away from the central regions of Bottle Gourd Continent (Baoping Zhou). We can leave Colorful Garb and its neighboring countries behind."

Chen Ping’an inquired, "What are the names of this sect and the father-son duo? How far is the sect from Rouge County, and in which direction?"

Though puzzled, Wu Shouwen answered each question. The sect, Misty Mountain (Menglong Shan), was over twelve hundred miles away on foot.

Finishing his tea, Chen Ping’an stood up and smiled. "Then I’ll pay a visit to Misty Mountain’s ancestral hall. I won’t be long."

Wu Shouwen quickly rose, shaking his head. "Chen Gongzi, don’t act rashly. This requires careful planning. Misty Mountain’s protective formation is known for its offensive power, and the sect is guarded by a Dragon Gate realm cultivator…"

Chen Ping’an’s calm demeanor remained unchanged. "Don’t worry. I’m just going to reason with them. If reasoning doesn’t work… I’ll handle it differently."

There were things he could reason about now, like Misty Mountain. And there were things he couldn’t address yet, like Zhengyang Mountain or the Xu family of Clear Breeze City. But one day, when the time came, he would unearth those matters like one retrieves an old jar of wine buried underground.

As for how he reasoned—well, he had both fists and swords.

At Misty Mountain’s ancestral hall, there would be no need for lengthy arguments.

Back at Fallen Cliff Mountain (Luo Po Shan), Elder Cui Cheng had once shared his philosophy: "With reasonable people, drink fine wine. With unreasonable ones, throw fast punches. That’s the Jianghu you should embrace, Chen Ping’an. You don’t train your fists just to spar in bed—they’re meant to challenge the world and make both the mountains and the rivers bow to you!"

Chen Ping’an had wholeheartedly agreed with the first part but found the latter overly dramatic. He hadn’t dared voice his thoughts then, fearing a punch from the elder, who was at his peak as a tenth-realm grandmaster. One misstep, and he might not have survived.

Wu Shouwen still felt uneasy. Even if this young man—now a refined adult—had shown remarkable composure and skill during the Rouge County siege, his opponent was a seasoned Dragon Gate realm cultivator. Not only that, but this master was also a sect leader with ties to Dali’s Iron Cavalry and rumored to be the next national advisor. His influence was unmatched. How could Chen Ping’an, alone, storm such a sect?

In Jianghu, youth and strength often triumphed. But in the cultivation world, it was experience and connections that mattered. Every Dragon Gate cultivator was a cunning old fox with formidable backing.

Zhao Shuxia, however, seemed unworried. To him, Chen Sir’s abilities were limitless.

Zhao Luan, on the other hand, was visibly anxious. Forgetting decorum, she rushed to Chen Ping’an’s side, tugging at his sleeve with tearful eyes. "Chen Sir, please don’t go!"

Chen Ping’an glanced at Wu Shouwen, then at Zhao Luan, and smiled helplessly. "I’m not going to my death. If I can’t win, I’ll run."

Zhao Luan’s tears flowed freely. "But Chen Sir, you said you were going to reason with them!"

Chen Ping’an was at a loss for words. He looked to Zhao Shuxia for help, but the boy only grinned sheepishly, making no move to assist.

Sighing, Chen Ping’an relented. "Fine, I’ll sit down and have more tea."

"Really?" Zhao Luan’s tear-streaked face brightened.

Chen Ping’an nodded, and she finally released his sleeve, cautiously returning to her seat.

Wu Shouwen also sat back down, continuing his persuasion. "Chen Gongzi, there’s no rush. I can take the children to explore the mountains and rivers."

Chen Ping’an asked, "And what about your family?"

Wu Shouwen replied, "I trust a Dragon Gate cultivator wouldn’t stoop to such shamelessness."

Chen Ping’an looked at him intently.

Wu Shouwen lowered his gaze to his teacup, sighing inwardly. He knew all too well that this "journey" was just a pretext to ease the children’s guilt. The real plan was to quietly bear the consequences himself.

Chen Ping’an placed his teacup down gently.

In an instant, he vanished.

Wu Shouwen froze, the teacup still in his hand.

Zhao Luan and Zhao Shuxia exchanged baffled looks.

Through the open door, they saw a figure in green standing in the courtyard. The sword on his back had already left its scabbard, transforming into a golden streak that soared into the sky. With a light step, the man leaped onto the flying sword, piercing through the rain as he sped northward.

Wu Shouwen snapped out of his daze, hastily sipping his tea to calm himself. Since he couldn’t stop him, there was nothing more to say.

Zhao Luan, her eyes glistening, quickly wiped her tears. Even with her face streaked, she looked radiant—a beauty that would easily captivate others. No wonder the young master of Misty Mountain had fallen for her at first sight.

Zhao Shuxia scratched his head, grinning. "Chen Sir really is something. Heading to someone’s ancestral hall as if he’s just running out to buy wine."

At a rain-soaked immortal mountain, the downpour was so heavy that it turned noon into twilight.

Thus, when a golden streak appeared on the horizon, accompanied by a thunderous roar, it was impossible to miss.

For the cultivators of Misty Mountain, even the blind and deaf would know—a sword immortal had come knocking.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 538: Sword Qi Arcs Across the Skies  

The commotion was far too overwhelming, and the aura of the intruder was anything but friendly. This was no casual visit from an old acquaintance of Misty Mountain (Menglong Shan).  

The awkward truth was that Misty Mountain simply didn't have such a dashing and formidable sword immortal among its allies.  

Without hesitation, Misty Mountain activated its protective formation, using the Ancestral Hall as the core. The torrential rain that already shrouded the mountain turned even darker, as if the heavens were weeping ink. Thick white mist rose from the mountain's base, enveloping the peaks. From the inside, the mountain remained as clear as broad daylight, but from the outside, it was an impenetrable white blur. To the passing woodcutters and hunters, Misty Mountain had vanished entirely, its outline dissolved into the mist.  

Adding to the spectacle, several beams of white light, each dozens of feet long, streaked out from the Ancestral Hall at the summit, weaving through the mist and rain like serpents.  

The mountain was on high alert.  

Most of Misty Mountain’s key cultivators had already left their residences to gather at the Ancestral Hall. Deep down, they all hoped that this sword immortal, whose presence was as awe-inspiring as a rainbow piercing the heavens, was a friend, not an enemy.  

Misty Mountain’s sect leader, Lü Yundai, and his direct heir, Lü Tingjiao, were both well-known figures in the kingdom of Caiyi. One was celebrated for his cultivation prowess; the other, for being the son of said prowess.  

Surrounding the father and son were dozens of renowned elders, direct disciples of the Ancestral Hall, and affiliated cultivators. All wore heavy expressions. Together, they could only watch helplessly as a streak of golden light approached Misty Mountain at breakneck speed.  

No one dared step outside to greet it.  

This was, after all, the most paradoxical existence under the heavens: a sword cultivator. Known as the most destitute yet most formidable of practitioners, they were one of the four most troublesome types of individuals in the cultivation world—and ranked first, no less. Their sword strikes were lethal, their movements lightning-fast, and their retreats even faster. But it was important to note that this "swiftness to flee" usually came after they had killed someone.  

In the past, Misty Mountain might have held a cautious respect for such a figure, but not this current, bone-deep dread. The world had shifted. The mountain’s spine had been broken alongside the collapse of the royal court and military on the plains below. The courage of cultivators had been shattered to pieces.  

Defensive alliances with neighboring sects, the coordinated support of water and mountain spirits, or even mobilizing the armies below to bolster their position—none of these measures were viable anymore. They had become nothing more than relics of the past.  

The old rules that had governed the immortal sects for thousands of years, unshaken even by thunder, had suddenly ceased to hold any weight.  

Now, the sects of Caiyi and the surrounding kingdoms were forced to engage with Dali’s local cultivators on a regular basis. Only then did they realize just how paper-thin their power and influence truly were.  

When the iron cavalry of Dali swept southward, it pierced through the façade of many so-called "powerhouses" like a hot knife through butter.  

Now, whether on the battlefield or within the mountains, nearly everyone was like a startled bird, skittish and ready to flee at the slightest sound.  

The armies of Caiyi, once boasting unparalleled prowess among the central nations of the continent, had been reduced to a laughingstock. The famed heavy infantry of Guyu, the swift light cavalry of Songxi, and the mountain warfare specialists of Shushui—none could even muster the courage to stand against Dali’s iron cavalry. Those who did were utterly crushed.  

The only so-called "victories" came from the southern vassal states like Shimao and Meiyou, where their fierce resistance caused mild inconvenience to Dali’s generals, Su Gaoshan and Cao Ping. In stark contrast, the armies of Caiyi and its neighboring states were so pitifully soft that they became the butt of countless jokes.  

Rumor had it that a once-renowned general of Shushui admitted after his crushing defeat that all his military strategies were learned from Dali’s vassal lord, Song Changjing. Unfortunately, he had not mastered them. His greatest wish in life now was to meet Song Changjing in person and humbly seek guidance. Thus, a tale of "returning to one’s roots" became a bittersweet anecdote.  

As for Caiyi, it fared no better. Despite boasting the largest and best-equipped army, it surrendered without a fight. The royal family, who had long flaunted the presence of a "Golden Core Earth Immortal" in their capital, was quick to send envoys to Dali, pledging fealty before the kingdom’s borders were even breached.  

The mountain sects fared no better. When Dali began auditing the genealogies of the various immortal sects, it became clear how shallow their foundations truly were. Even Guyu, which had secretly harbored a Dragon Gate-level sword cultivator, lost him in a brutal battle against Dali’s martial experts.  

Caiyi was spared from complete humiliation only because Lü Yundai had recently ascended to the Dragon Gate realm, salvaging some dignity for the sect. Otherwise, the highest-ranking cultivator in the kingdom would have been a mere Seaview-level elder, and Misty Mountain would have become the laughingstock of its peers.  

Lü Yundai was an elderly man dressed in resplendent robes, his high crown adding a sense of dignity to his already impressive appearance.  

Lü Tingjiao, in contrast, was a dashing young man with slightly sunken eyes. His fair looks, coupled with his snow-white spiritual robe named "Reed Flower"—a high-grade magical artifact—gave him the appearance of a youth barely out of his teens, despite being in his thirties. While his cultivation might have been propped up by wealth rather than talent, he had still reached the fifth realm, making him more than passable in the secular world. Among the nobility of Caiyi, he was considered a promising young talent.  

However, in the eyes of true cultivators—especially the few middle-tier immortals or mountain deities in Caiyi—Lü Tingjiao was nothing. His heart for the Dao was weak, his indulgence in carnal pleasures excessive, and his time wasted in the mortal world's frivolities. If Lü Yundai truly intended to pass Misty Mountain’s legacy to his son, it might very well lead to internal strife.  

There was, however, a rumor circulating in recent years. It suggested that Misty Mountain’s newfound connection to a prominent Dali general—one who might soon become Caiyi’s national preceptor—was thanks to Lü Tingjiao’s behind-the-scenes efforts. If true, this would reveal a shrewdness beneath his frivolous exterior.  

An elderly cultivator leaning on a cane broke the tense silence. "Sect Leader, forgive this old man’s failing eyesight, but I cannot discern the intruder’s realm. Could it be… an Earth Immortal?"  

Lü Yundai’s expression remained calm as he chuckled. "An Earth Immortal sword cultivator?"  

The old man seemed to realize he had scared himself unnecessarily. With the sect’s formation active and their position fortified at the Ancestral Hall, there was no need to lose composure. Embarrassed, he muttered, "That would be far too extraordinary. Surely not."  

A beautiful woman, her waist adorned with an ancient sword, sneered. "And what if it is a middle-tier sword cultivator passing through? Would they dare to force their way through Misty Mountain’s formation? Do they think we’re some soft target to be trifled with?"  

Lü Tingjiao glanced at the woman’s ample chest, his eyes narrowing briefly before looking away. This woman, though not highly ranked in cultivation, was skilled in the art of sword manipulation—a technique borrowed from mortal swordmasters. She had once frightened off a Seaview-level cultivator from Shushui by pretending to be at his level, a feat that spoke to her audacity. However, her fiery temper and lack of charm made her a wasted beauty in Lü Tingjiao’s eyes.  

Still, he had plans. If he could reach the Cave Dwelling realm, his father had promised to arrange a "marriage of convenience" with her. Essentially, she would become his concubine in all but name.  

The conversation shifted as a young disciple, his voice tinged with envy, whispered, "Won’t those high-and-mighty Dali cultivators intervene?"  

This young man, standing near the back due to his low seniority, was the sword-wielding woman’s favorite disciple. He carried a treasured sword gifted by the Ancestral Hall, but as a mere third-realm sword cultivator, his flying sword had barely reached its embryonic stage. The sight of the approaching sword immortal filled him with both admiration and jealousy. He secretly hoped the intruder would recklessly charge into the formation and be shredded by its defenses, leaving behind a prized sword that could become his own.  

However, the golden streak in the sky grew ever closer, its thunderous momentum shaking Misty Mountain’s spiritual energies. The six flying swords guarding the formation trembled slightly, their precise orbits disrupted.  

Lü Yundai murmured, "If they stop outside the formation, then perhaps they’re not here for vengeance."  

The others nodded in agreement.  

The cane-wielding elder squinted into the distance, trying to gauge the intruder’s cultivation level. But the golden sword light was so dazzling that even his Seaview-level eyes burned with pain. He quickly turned away, fearing that the sword immortal might mistake his gaze for a provocation.  

"Such brilliance…" the elder muttered, his voice trembling. "It must be a celestial artifact. Sect Leader, perhaps we should open the gates and invite them in. Better that than provoke them…"  

Lü Yundai, ever composed, replied, "Elder Hong, it’s clear they’ve come for us. There’s no doubt about it."  

The elder fell silent, as did the others.  

Only Lü Yundai dared to meet the oncoming sword light head-on.  

He whispered, as much to himself as to the others, "They’ve arrived."  

The golden light illuminated the stormy night as if it were midday. As it neared Misty Mountain’s peak, it showed no sign of stopping. Without hesitation, it pierced through the protective formation, slicing it like a knife through butter, and shot straight toward the Ancestral Hall.  

The six guardian swords, which had served Misty Mountain so faithfully, failed to intercept the intruder. They wavered in fear, their very essence trembling.  

The golden streak continued unabated, leaving the formation in tatters.  

A solitary figure descended from the sky, clad in a simple azure robe. He was tall, youthful, and unassuming—except for the extraordinary presence that clung to him like a second skin.  

Landing gracefully, the man sheathed his sword with effortless precision, the motion as natural as flowing water.  

Chen Ping’an tucked his hands into his sleeves and strolled forward, his gaze sweeping over the gathered cultivators. His eyes lingered briefly on Lü Yundai, who managed to maintain his composure, and then on Lü Tingjiao, whose shifty gaze betrayed his unease.  

With a faint smile, Chen Ping’an spoke, "I’ve come to Misty Mountain today with a simple message: I am the guardian of Zhao Luan from Rouge County in Caiyi. Do you understand?"  

The cane-wielding elder, resigned to a quiet retirement, bobbed his head hastily. Whether he understood or not didn’t matter—he would pretend he did.  

The sword-wielding woman felt her throat go dry, her earlier bravado evaporating completely. Behind her, her young disciple couldn’t even muster the courage to look the intruder in the eye.  

Lü Yundai, maintaining a polite smile, asked, "Might I ask what Senior means by this?"  

Chen Ping’an’s gaze shifted beyond the crowd to the Ancestral Hall. "Is that your Ancestral Hall?"  

Lü Yundai’s expression darkened. "Senior, are you here to bully us with brute force? Shouldn’t you explain matters clearly before resorting to intimidation?"  

Chen Ping’an tilted his head slightly, unimpressed by Lü Yundai’s attempt at moral high ground. He responded in Dali’s official dialect, "I’m from Dali. If your backer happens to be the Dali cavalry, don’t count on their protection. Of course, whether you believe me or not is up to you. For the record, my relationship with the Dali court is… complicated."  

Lü Tingjiao cursed inwardly. *What’s the point of saying all this? Our sect is full of spineless cowards. How could we possibly stand united against this man?*  

Chen Ping’an’s tone shifted, his words as sharp as his sword. "As Zhao Luan’s guardian, I won’t waste time with pleasantries. I’ll ask you once: Do you or your son intend to covet Zhao Luan’s talents or her beauty? Answer honestly—yes or no."  

The crowd fell silent.  

Lü Yundai’s face darkened further. He despised such directness.  

Lü Tingjiao opened his mouth to deflect, but Chen Ping’an cut him off with a smile. "Don’t bother with your slippery words or your so-called logic. You’ll claim that Zhao Luan is a rare talent worthy of your sect’s guidance, that you’d never coerce her, and that your son, Lü Tingjiao, has done nothing to warrant punishment. You’ll also invoke Dali’s laws against unprovoked conflict, hoping to stall for time. I’ve heard it all before.  

"I’m busy. You’re not. So I’ll ask again: yes or no."  

Chen Ping’an rubbed his face, muttering to himself, "I really need to stop rambling before fights. It’s a bad habit, just like Ma Kuxuan’s back in the day."  

After a brief pause, he nodded. "I see."  

Reaching behind him, he drew his sword.  

With a casual swing, the blade released a wave of sword qi that split the Ancestral Hall in two.  

The hall didn’t collapse entirely, but the damage was unmistakable.  

No one dared look back, except for the young sword cultivator, who couldn’t resist turning to see the aftermath.  

Chen Ping’an sheathed his sword with a fluid motion.  

As Lü Yundai began to make a move, Chen Ping’an’s hand flicked, and in an instant, he closed the twenty-step gap between them.  

The impact sent Lü Yundai flying, blood streaming from his orifices as he crashed dozens of feet away.  

Chen Ping’an glanced at the retreating figures, his gaze stopping on Lü Tingjiao. "You’re one of the culprits. Speak."  

Trembling, Lü Tingjiao stammered, "Since Senior is Zhao Luan’s guardian, Misty Mountain will ensure that none of our members ever cross paths with her again!"  

Chen Ping’an smiled faintly. "You don’t mean that. But it’s fine. I’ll wait in Rouge County for a few days. Send someone—or something—to show your sincerity. Otherwise, I’ll visit Misty Mountain again."  

He glanced at the fractured Ancestral Hall, his expression darkening. The sword on his back hummed with excitement, its golden qi spilling out like liquid sunlight.  

"Don’t waste my time," he warned before turning to leave.  

With a step, he rose into the air, his sword carrying him as he vanished into the clouds.  

The storm lingered, but the oppressive sword qi remained, a stark reminder of what had transpired.  

Back atop Misty Mountain, Lü Yundai stood pale but resolute. "We’ll discuss this tomorrow," he declared, dismissing the crowd.  

Lü Tingjiao walked alongside his father, his mind racing.  

"You have two options," Lü Yundai said flatly. "Bet on our Dali backer—or surrender."  

As father and son debated their next move, the shadow of Chen Ping’an’s blade loomed large over Misty Mountain.  

 ### Chapter 539: Never Seen a Semi-Immortal Weapon? (Part 1)

The sky was just beginning to lighten. Outside the city gates of Rouge County in the colorful-robe-wearing kingdom of Caiyi, a group of martial artists on horseback waited for the gates to open. Among them sat a renowned master from the martial world of Shuishui Kingdom, perched high on his horse. He idly rubbed a piece of suet jade in his palm, glancing around out of boredom. In the distance, he noticed a young wanderer trudging toward the city gates. The youth's face was weary, but his eyes remained sharp and clear. The old master judged him to be a practitioner, though his gait suggested his skills were modest at best.

After a brief glance, the elder let his eyes wander again, scanning the women and young girls nearby. However, most were rustic villagers with rough skin and plain features, leaving him somewhat disappointed. He silently hoped the women inside the city of Rouge County wouldn't all be like this.

The young man in the blue robe, Chen Ping’an, took a quick look at the bustling crowd outside the gates before heading to a nearby breakfast stall. Though there were no seats left, he still ordered a portion of fried rice cakes drizzled with sugar and a bowl of white rice porridge. The stall owner hesitated for a moment, initially wanting to remind him to return the bowl and chopsticks. But upon noticing the sword strapped to the young man's back, he wisely swallowed his words—better to be polite when dealing with travelers of the martial world.

After finishing his meal slowly while crouched by the roadside, Chen Ping’an returned the bowl and chopsticks to the stall owner. By then, the city gates had opened. He stood by the roadside, waiting to enter.

The old martial artist, having tucked away his piece of jade, glanced once more at the young man and smiled knowingly. When he was that age, his fortunes had already turned much better; he was far from this kind of destitution.

Chen Ping’an paid no mind to the elder’s scrutinizing gaze. He followed the crowd, handed over his identification, and entered the city. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to use his sword to fly back to the house he was staying in—it was that he was utterly drained. The journey to and from Rouge County and Misty Mountain (Menglong Shan) had pushed him to his limits. Any further exertion wouldn’t be training his endurance; it would be courting death. The practice of sitting meditation, while beneficial for the soul, could harm the physical body if overdone, resulting in a loss of vitality. It was a delicate balance.

Still, he mused, using meditation to endure long-distance sword travel could be a useful method in the future. However, this would only work in Baoping Continent, where sword cultivators were less common. In Beiju Luzhou, a region teeming with sword masters, it might not be so wise. There, even something as trivial as a disapproving glance could serve as justification for a bloody duel.

Instead of heading straight to the house of Mr. Yu (the Fisherman), Chen Ping’an first paid a visit to the City God Pavilion. To his surprise, he learned that the previous City God, Lord Shen, had been replaced. He sighed softly. This wasn’t a case of the court betraying its loyal servants; Rouge County was a significant location for the Caiyi Kingdom. After the golden body of the former City God had perished, it was inevitable that a new deity would take the position to oversee the region.

Choosing not to enter the pavilion, Chen Ping’an followed an old route he once walked and arrived at a small, secluded Earth Temple. It was so small that it had no temple caretaker, and visitors had to bring their own incense for offerings. This was the place where he had bid farewell to Lord Shen, the City God, years ago.

After some thought, Chen Ping’an stepped over the threshold. Seeing that no one else was around, he retrieved three sticks of incense from his spatial artifact, the "Inch of Separation." This incense, with a fresh and natural fragrance, was a true treasure from the mountains. It wasn’t just for repelling mosquitoes; it could also ward off evil spirits in bustling marketplaces.

Years ago, on his way to the Lion Garden near the Water God Temple of Qingluan Kingdom, a temple caretaker had gifted him a bamboo incense holder filled with twenty-four sticks of rare water incense. Most of it had been left behind at Luopo Mountain, but he brought three with him for emergencies. He hadn’t expected to use them so soon.

Burning mountain or water incense in certain temples might be taboo, but in places like the City God Pavilion or civil and military temples, it was permissible.

With a gentle pinch, the incense ignited without the need for a flame. Chen Ping’an stood still, held the incense above his head in reverence, and silently offered his prayers. Finally, he placed the three sticks into a bronze censer, closed his eyes briefly, then turned to leave.

Back at the small house in the alley, Chen Ping’an knocked on the door. This time, it wasn’t Zhao Shuxia who answered but Zhao Luan. The young girl looked at him with a quiet, soulful gaze, as if her eyes could speak.

In the courtyard, Mr. Yu, whose real name was Wu Shouwen, stood with Zhao Shuxia near a decorative screen wall. Having spent years with playful children like Pei Qian and the pink-dressed girl, Chen Ping’an instinctively wanted to pat Zhao Luan on the head as a greeting. But remembering that she was no longer a little girl, he simply smiled and said, “It’s all fine now. The cultivators at Misty Mountain were reasonable. Luan’er, from now on, stay close to your master and focus on your cultivation.”

Zhao Shuxia clenched his fist in celebration. As expected, Mr. Chen, who had taught him boxing, was capable of anything!

Although Wu Shouwen had many questions, he refrained from asking in front of the two children. Instead, he simply nodded and smiled at Chen Ping’an before inviting him to the backyard hall.

As before, Zhao Shuxia and Zhao Luan drank tea to nourish their souls, while Chen Ping’an took out two jars of Wu Cry Wine. He handed one to Mr. Yu, keeping the other for himself.

Wu Shouwen sighed with a hint of regret. “It’s a pity the kids are still too young to drink.”

Taking a sip, he quickly decided to save the rest. Smiling, he said, “I’ll keep this for later. When they’re older and it’s appropriate for them to drink, I’ll bring it out again.”

Chen Ping’an, seeing through this excuse, placed another jar of Wu Cry Wine before Wu Shouwen. “Mr. Wu, your talent for getting free wine is truly impressive. Don’t worry, I still have plenty.”

Wu Shouwen chuckled, unashamed. Taking the wine, he teased, “Young Master Chen, don’t judge a gentleman’s heart with a petty mind.”

Raising his jar, Chen Ping’an clinked it lightly against Wu Shouwen’s in a makeshift toast, and they both drank. 

Chen Ping’an didn’t go into the details of his journey to Misty Mountain. However, seeing Mr. Yu in such high spirits, he said softly, “Mr. Wu, the matter at Misty Mountain has been completely resolved. If you’re still uneasy, you could consider traveling to other regions to broaden the children’s horizons. Whether to gain some worldly experience or to see the vast landscapes, it’s all beneficial.”

Wu Shouwen nodded. “That’s a good idea.”

They continued chatting casually, discussing the political and martial landscapes of Caiyi and Shuishui Kingdoms. Occasionally, Chen Ping’an would glance at the young boy, who seemed to eye the wine with envy, and the young girl, who would sneak peeks at him but quickly look away. His heart, once weighed down by tension, returned to a state of tranquility, like a ruler finding its center after being stretched to its extremes.

---

The chapter continues with Chen Ping’an teaching Zhao Shuxia boxing techniques, addressing Zhao Luan’s silent affection, and his eventual departure, leaving behind gifts and advice for the children and Mr. Wu. The story weaves themes of mentorship, unspoken bonds, and the bittersweet nature of parting, all while maintaining the gentle, reflective tone that captures the essence of Chen Ping’an’s character. 

*(To be continued...)*

 ### Chapter 540: Never Seen a Half-Immortal Weapon? (Part 2)

On a remote mountain path near the border of the Colorful Clothes Kingdom (Caiyi Guo) and the Comb Water Kingdom (Shushui Guo), a lone figure in a simple green robe walked slowly. On his back, he carried a large bamboo box, and in his hand was a crude hiking staff, seemingly hacked out of a branch. Having traveled over a hundred miles of rugged mountain terrain, his journey finally brought him, under the cover of night, to a dilapidated ancient temple. The temple was full of cobwebs, and the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism lay toppled on the ground, just as they had been for years. Occasionally, gusts of wind would whistle through the temple, carrying an eerie chill.

The young man lit a campfire, closed his eyes, and began to doze off. Yet, it was clear he didn’t dare fully fall asleep, as though worried that the supernatural beings from the stories in his books might suddenly appear. 

Around midnight, faint laughter—the kind that might belong to playful swallows or orioles—echoed in the distance and gradually drew closer. 

The green-robed scholar, who looked like a student traveling with books, lowered his head, a slight smirk tugging at the corners of his lips. But as he raised his gaze to peer outside, his expression shifted to one of feigned surprise and confusion.

The ancient temple was quite spacious, and the campfire wasn’t particularly close to the entrance. Three women in colorful attire wandered in, their laughter as light and carefree as butterflies flitting through the air. One was a round-faced, almond-eyed girl, seemingly just entering her teens; another was a tall, elegant woman with her hair styled in a high bun, appearing to be in her early twenties; the last was a voluptuous, mature beauty whose glossy hair was arranged in a loose bun, her every movement exuding charm. 

The three women played and teased one another, their laughter echoing as they floated into the temple. However, upon spotting the wide-eyed young man by the campfire, they suddenly hesitated. A trace of shyness crossed their faces as they huddled together, slowing their steps. They nudged one another forward, clearly unsure of how to approach him.

The mature woman seemed the bolder of the three. She squatted near the fire and extended her hands toward the flames, stealing glances at the young man all the while. 

The tall woman stood off to the side, her gaze sharp as she evaluated the stranger, as if gauging whether he posed a threat.

The almond-eyed girl was the most timid, standing sideways with her fingers intertwined, her delicate embroidered shoes peeking out from beneath her skirt as she stared intently at her toes.

The voluptuous woman suddenly froze, her expression briefly startled. 

The young scholar had begun to chuckle, as though unable to maintain the pretense of seriousness he had been feigning earlier.

The woman, still crouched by the fire, reached into her ample bosom and pulled out a delicate embroidered handkerchief. Gently fanning herself, she spoke in a soft, syrupy voice, “Young Master, are you feeling warm? It’s strange—I suddenly feel like my clothes are a bit too thick.” 

The young man, still extending his hands toward the fire, smiled faintly. “If you’re feeling warm, why are you still sitting by the fire?”

The woman was momentarily speechless, then rolled her eyes coquettishly, her laughter rippling like a blooming flower. “Young Master, you’re so witty! I can tell you must be a man who truly understands women.”

The scholar chuckled. “Well, then, by all means, laugh to your heart’s content.”

The flirtatious woman laughed for a moment but soon found herself unable to keep it up. Reluctant to admit defeat, she licked her lips and squinted at him. “Young Master, you’re quite handsome, easy on the eyes, and pleasant to talk to. But I wonder, are you as capable as you look?” 

The young man’s smile didn’t falter. “Auntie, you’re quite good at joking too.”

The woman’s smile froze on her face.

The young man, who had deliberately returned to this ruined temple in disguise, scanned the three women again. Finally, his gaze settled on the shy youngest one. With a knowing smile, he said, “Enough. I know who you all are. We've met before.”

The three women reacted in different ways. The voluptuous woman looked confused and resentful, clutching her handkerchief to cover her exposed chest. The tall woman frowned deeply, while the almond-eyed girl remained as shy as ever, seemingly oblivious to his words.

The scholar added another dry branch to the fire, his gaze still fixed on the embroidered-shoe-wearing girl. He couldn’t help but wonder if she was forgetful or just particularly fastidious, as her shoes and skirt remained spotless despite the long journey on dusty mountain roads. He spoke slowly, “Don’t remember? Let me jog your memory. About seven years ago, there were four travelers sitting right here. A bearded swordsman, a young Daoist priest, a scholarly gentleman, and a poor boy... Later, at Swordwater Manor, we met again.”

The girl finally turned to face him, a hand covering her mouth as she laughed. “How could I forget? That was the time we suffered terribly at the hands of you and that old bastard Song. Just thinking about it still makes my heart ache. You men are so cruel, killing my two poor maidservants without a second thought. If I’m not mistaken, weren’t you the ruthless one back then? My, my, you’ve grown so much more handsome. What a shame. What brings you here this time? Looking for trouble again?”

She clasped her hands behind her back and circled halfway around the fire, keeping a deliberate distance. “Don’t tell me you’ve finally learned to appreciate women and grown tired of the ordinary ones. So, you’ve come to try something new? Hoping to see if us ghostly beauties are as good in bed as the stories say?”

The young man waved his hand dismissively. “Perish the thought. I happen to know Madam has a fondness for stir-fried hearts and livers, preferably from cultivators, as they lack the earthy stench of mortals.”

He glanced toward the temple entrance. “It seems that after Song Laoqian cut down so many of your underlings back then, your power isn’t what it used to be.”

The almond-eyed girl pouted, prodding the fire with the tip of her embroidered shoe. “Fine, you’ve forced us out of hiding. What do you want?”

The young man asked casually, “After the battle at Swordwater Manor, the original Four Fiends of the Comb Water Kingdom were all but wiped out—some dead, some fled. I heard that in the Colorful Clothes Kingdom, new Four Fiends quickly rose to power. Were they from your old faction?”

The girl sighed, squatting down as she replied, “Two of them died early—bad luck, really. They were killed by some official from the Great Li Empire, a so-called Secretary of Martial Affairs. Another one, well, he was just a lackey who almost fled entirely. I convinced him to stay. Good thing he listened, or he wouldn’t have gotten where he is now. But I regret it terribly. In the chaos of those years, he grew stronger, amassed a horde of ferocious underlings, and even got an official title from the court. Life’s been great for him. As for me? Almost got dragged off to be his wife. This world, I tell you—it’s hard to be human, and even harder to be a ghost. What is this nonsense?”

While she spoke, the young man observed her two companions out of the corner of his eye. Though the almond-eyed girl had considerable cultivation for a ghost, it was no longer significant in his eyes. After all, his focus wasn’t on her power but on the karmic threads that tied her fate to the world. 

He sighed. “Tell me, how many men have you harmed over the years?”

The girl rolled her eyes. “Harm? Such an ugly word. It was all consensual. They got their pleasures, and my sisters and I absorbed their Yang energy to avoid becoming vengeful spirits. Everyone was happy. Of course, if we ran into scum that even you cultivators wouldn’t bother with, well, let’s just say I didn’t mind stir-frying a few hearts and livers.”

The young man didn’t respond, as though lost in old memories.

She clicked her tongue and sized him up. “I almost didn’t recognize you. If you hadn’t spoken, I’d never have guessed. You were so dark and scruffy back then. They say girls change the most as they grow up, but I guess men do too.”

The young man quipped, “If you truly can’t recognize me, I might just reconsider sparing you.”

She glared at him but said nothing, her nerves fraying as his calm demeanor unsettled her further.

---

The scene shifted as a menacing figure arrived. A mountain spirit, now a self-proclaimed "Mountain God," barged into the temple with overwhelming swagger. Yet, the young man remained seated by the fire, unperturbed. As events unfolded, the tension in the temple reached a boiling point.

With a casual motion, the young man reached for the sword in his bamboo box. 

“Ever seen a half-immortal weapon before?” he asked with a faint smile.

What followed was a display of power so precise and overwhelming that the "Mountain God," along with his schemes and boasts, crumbled—both literally and metaphorically—beneath the young man’s blade. 

When the dust settled, the temple fell silent once more. The almond-eyed girl and her companions, now shaken to their cores, were spared. The young man left them with a cryptic piece of advice: seek redemption, accumulate virtue, and perhaps even the unseen gods might take notice.

---

As dawn broke, the green-robed scholar stood atop a cliff, practicing his forms with serene focus. 

The world before him looked vast and boundless, painted in hues of a new day. He smiled faintly, gazing into the horizon.

Spring would soon arrive. Peach blossoms would bloom red, pear flowers white, and rapeseed flowers golden. It was a beautiful world, after all. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 541: I Heard You're Asking About the Sword (Part 1)

By the banks of the Iron Symbol River, several venerable Confucian scholars in tall hats and long robes led a procession, followed by young men and women clad in scholarly attire, clearly disciples of the Confucian school. The group resembled a long, green snake, with everyone reciting the *Encouragement to Study* in unison.

The river flowed gently, harmonizing with their spirited voices.

Among the crowd, a young woman dressed in red stood out. A silver gourd filled with clear water hung at her waist, while she carried a small green bamboo book box on her back. After passing through Candlelight Town and Chess Mound Mountain, she had confided in the head of the Maoshan sect that she wished to return alone to Longquan County, allowing her to decide her own pace. However, the scholar did not agree, insisting that traversing mountains and rivers was not simply about scholarly pursuits and that one should act together in unity.

As they passed the Iron Symbol River Water Deity Temple, they encountered Yang Hua, the highest-ranking water deity of the Great Li Dynasty, who rarely appeared before mortals. To the astonishment of the students, she materialized, holding a golden-hilted sword as she watched over this group of promising scholars from both the Sui and Li Dynasties. Ordinarily, even though the Mountain Cliff Academy had lost its title among the Seventy-Two Academies, Yang Hua, as a prominent deity of the Great Li, had no need to extend such courtesies.

However, the Mountain Cliff Academy, relocated to the eastern Huashan Mountain of the Great Sui capital, had once been regarded as a sacred place in the hearts of scholars from the Great Li. The academy’s master, Mao Xiaodong, still enjoyed the admiration of many in the Great Li, particularly from the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of War, where he was held in high regard.

Yang Hua had once served as a sword attendant to a royal lady in the palace and had long admired the Mountain Cliff Academy, having visited it alongside the lady. She had even met the tall scholar, Master Mao, long ago, which explained her unexpected appearance today.

At the waterfall where the Iron Symbol River met the Long Beard River, a gathering awaited their arrival.

The heads of the Deer Academy in the Cloudy Mountain, as well as the governor of Longquan County, Wu Yuan, county magistrate Yuan, and Supervisor Cao, were among them. 

An elder from the Li family, the head of the Li clan on Fortune and Prosperity Street, was also present. He was the grandfather of the three siblings, Li Xisheng, Li Baozhen, and Li Baoping. Now a Yuanying (Nascent Soul) cultivator, he had become a top-tier venerator of the Great Li, although he had kept this status largely under wraps.

The Great Li’s Song family had once made a secret pact with the sages, allowing various clans to "retain" one to three gifted disciples among their members. This arrangement had continued for generations, despite the constraints imposed by the natural order and prohibitions of the Li Pearl Cave Heaven. However, after their cultivation, these disciples could not leave the cave world at will. Still, every hundred years, three fixed slots were available for discreet departures. The mystery surrounding why the Li family head had remained in the Great Li despite ascending to the Golden Core stage was a complicated matter.

The Li elder's gaze fell upon his beloved granddaughter, and his face lit up with a smile that he could not hide. Yet, he felt a pang of nostalgia, sensing that his granddaughter still held onto her solitary nature, somewhat different yet unchanged. He felt a mix of joy and sorrow—she had grown up without a word, not even greeting her doting grandfather as she matured in her own quiet way.

In the Li family, the bond between grandparents and grandchildren was the most evident, especially with the youngest granddaughter, Li Baoping, whose affection from the elder surpassed that of her two older brothers combined. Despite the subtle favoritism shown by their mother, both elder brothers showered their younger sister with unreserved love.

Carrying the old, small bamboo box, Li Baoping walked beside the shallow, resounding Long Beard River.

Not far away, Li Huai, along with two friends and Lin Shouyi, who was engaged in conversation with a teacher from the academy, also carried similar bamboo boxes. 

The three bamboo boxes were crafted by the same person, although Li Baoping's was made from the plainest green bamboo and was the oldest. Lin Shouyi's and Li Huai's boxes, made from the more exquisite and vibrant bamboo after passing Chess Mound Mountain, remained lushly green even years later.

As for Yu Lu and Xie Xie, who had only met Chen Ping'an for the first time at the Great Li Pass, they lacked such a privilege.

The Great Li’s Northern Mountain Deity, Wei Bo, did not make an appearance, nor did the sage Ruan Qiong. 

One of the vice-headmasters of the Mountain Cliff Academy, who had once argued with Mao Xiaodong and had been counseled by Cui Dongshan, frowned at the Great Li's actions, which were reasonable but lacked courtesy. 

The two most significant figures had blatantly disregarded the Mountain Cliff Academy. 

It seemed that neither the Deer Academy nor the governor of Longquan County, Wu Yuan, intended to offer any explanations regarding this slight. 

The vice-headmaster, hailing from a noble family of the Great Sui, couldn't help but feel a sense of regret. After all, the ebb and flow of both nations’ strengths left one to reminisce. How many scholars had traveled from the Great Li to seek fame and recognition from their renowned poets back in the day? 

The procession halted, and the Confucian scholars exchanged polite greetings with their Great Li counterparts. 

Li Baoping caught sight of her grandfather, and a glimpse of her childhood joy returned as she joyfully shook her bamboo box and silver gourd, running towards him.

“Little Baoping, slow down!” the elder called out with a smile.

Li Baoping stopped suddenly in front of him, beaming as she shouted, “Grandfather!” 

The elder feigned a stern complaint, “You’re growing up, young lady! You ought to act your age.” 

Nearby, Ma Lian, of the Great Sui’s elite background, finally saw the girl’s radiant smile and sighed in relief, his mood lifting. 

Liu Guan shook his head at this scene, bemused by Ma Lian’s infatuation. It seemed hopeless—he could barely function when he didn’t see her for days and never dared to greet her on the rare occasions they crossed paths. Liu Guan couldn’t fathom how Ma Lian, a scion of a prestigious family, could be so timid about expressing his feelings for a girl.

Li Huai was aware of the background details. The academy had received a letter from Chen Ping'an in Longquan County, indicating that Li Baoping wished to take a leave to return home. However, when the academy’s scholars denied her request, she prepared to sneak away. Just then, a message arrived stating that Mao Xiaodong would personally lead a group of academy disciples to the Great Li’s Cloudy Mountain for a journey of exploration, followed by a scholarly exchange with the Deer Academy, and to witness the rare event of numerous deities touring the mountains at night.

Ultimately, it was Li Baoping’s own fault for wanting to surprise her little master uncle, keeping the plan to return home under wraps.

However, halfway through, Li Baoping found out about the news—perhaps she received a letter from home or something else—and her spirits began to wane. She became increasingly withdrawn, gradually returning to the state she had been in during her earlier years at the academy. 

Now, as the students of the Mountain Cliff Academy approached the Deer Academy at Cloudy Mountain, they would enjoy two days of free time before reuniting to witness the grand mountain night feast hosted by the Great Li's Northern Mountain.

The group marched through the small town in a grand procession.

The Li elder chose not to return to the family estate on Fortune and Prosperity Street, intending instead to accompany Li Baoping into the mountains. As a Nascent Soul cultivator and esteemed venerator of the Great Li, he understood that his presence beside her would only push his granddaughter further from her Sui classmates.

Just as the Sui academy students left the small town and passed Pearl Mountain, a girl with a walking stick and a sword at her waist, accompanied by a strong yellow dog, came running. Being short, she couldn't see the red figure among the procession, so she dashed up to her master’s mountain peak. There, she spotted a familiar silhouette and waved her hand energetically, calling out, “Sister Baoping! I’m here, over here!”

Li Baoping turned around abruptly and caught sight of Pei Qian, who was hopping with excitement. She quickly left her group and ran towards the small mountain peak.

Li Huai couldn’t help but chuckle, stopping in his tracks and calling out, “Pei Qian! What about me?”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, ignoring him.

Liu Guan and Ma Lian erupted into laughter at the scene.

Over the years, Pei Qian had occasionally sent letters to the Great Sui Academy, sometimes mentioning Ma Lian and Liu Guan as her “pawns.” After all, they had promised to travel through the world together, seeking treasure and sharing the spoils. However, without a few cheerleaders around, her identity wouldn’t stand out. Although Ma Lian was a bit dense, he was loyal, while Liu Guan was crafty enough to act as a strategist.

As Li Baoping approached Pearl Mountain, Pei Qian was coming down, and the two met at the foot of the hill.

Li Baoping playfully pressed down Pei Qian’s head, gesturing as she asked, “Pei Qian, why haven’t you grown taller?”

Pei Qian looked as if struck by lightning, her mood dampening.

“Sister Baoping, you really know how to hit where it hurts,” she muttered. 

Suddenly, Li Baoping remarked, “It’s fine; it’s not about height, but ambition!”

Pei Qian’s spirits lifted a bit, “That’s right! My ambitions are known in Luopo Mountain! Even my master recognizes it!”

As she said this, Pei Qian glanced sideways at the sturdy yellow dog lying nearby.

The dog hung its head, afraid to meet the gaze of the girl holding the walking stick.

Speaking of her master, Pei Qian comforted, “Sister Baoping, don’t be sad! My master didn’t know you were coming, so he ran off to wander the world. Don’t feel upset; I’ll help you scold him when I see him… well, just a word or two.” 

Li Baoping, now nearly a head taller than Pei Qian, smiled and asked, “What were you doing in the town instead of practicing your mad sword technique on Luopo Mountain?”

Pei Qian puffed up her chest, standing on her tiptoes, “Sister Baoping, you don’t know! I’m helping my master manage two big shops in the town!”

Li Baoping was taken aback, “You’re already this capable?”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, “If you don’t believe me, I can take you to Qilong Alley right now! The spring couplets, door gods, and good luck symbols—they're all posted by me!”

Li Baoping nodded with approval, “Not bad! You might be small, but you can help your little master uncle now.”

Pei Qian beamed, her smile widening. Sister Baoping rarely praised anyone.

Li Baoping glanced back at the procession and said to Pei Qian, “I need to go to the Deer Academy at Cloudy Mountain first. Once I settle in, I’ll come down and play with you.”

Pei Qian looked at her tall, slender sister and suddenly remembered something. The cheerful girl from moments ago was now in tears, her head bowed as she wiped her eyes with her sleeve. “Sister Baoping, my master has lost so much weight since coming home! Even thinner than you; I almost didn’t recognize him! He didn’t say anything, but I know he must have had a hard time at Shujian Lake for three years. Sister Baoping, you read so much and are so capable and brave. My master likes you so much. You haven’t gone to see him all these years. If he sees you, he’ll be happier than if he saw me... maybe he won’t feel so tired then.” 

Li Baoping laughed, turning to gaze southward, narrowing her eyes slightly. Her once round face had become more oval and pointed over the years.

Bending down, she gently wiped Pei Qian’s tears away and whispered, “Alright, it’s my fault. Blame me.”

After Pei Qian finished crying, she felt a bit guilty. “I’m sorry, Sister Baoping. I was just rambling.”

Li Baoping patted Pei Qian’s shoulder, smiling, “See you later.”

Pei Qian nodded, watching as Li Baoping turned to leave.

Sister Baoping, with that little bamboo box, still wore her familiar red attire. Yet, as Pei Qian watched her gradually receding figure, an inexplicable worry crept into her heart. What if when she saw Sister Baoping again tomorrow or the day after, she had grown taller and looked different? Would it feel the same as when their master first entered the Mountain Cliff Academy? Back then, she had wanted to pull them along to play those fun games on the academy lake. Was it because her master had already foreseen today? Though it seemed delightful, growing up was truly a serious business, wasn’t it?

Pei Qian scratched her head, stomping her foot in frustration. As the three-shopkeeper of two stores now, how could she forget to give Sister Baoping a treat? 

She sighed, pulling out two skewers of candied hawthorn wrapped in oiled paper from her sleeve, realizing she had forgotten to share them with Sister Baoping!

With a heavy heart, she returned one skewer to her sleeve, keeping the other for herself. The taste was delightful—and the money for the hawthorn was given to her by Shi Rou. She wasn’t the type to be greedy, but when she had casually mentioned candied hawthorn while running the New Year’s shop, Shi Rou had handed her a handful of copper coins, saying it was a treat she didn’t need to pay back. 

Feeling embarrassed, Pei Qian had initially refused, shaking her head and waving her hands, saying it was unnecessary. But in the end, she had accepted it, unable to turn down such kindness.

Having finished the candied hawthorn, she decided to save the other skewer for Shi Rou, planning to pay for Sister Baoping’s share tomorrow.

This was how people in the Jianghu lived—so generously.

Pei Qian swung her walking stick and spotted the yellow dog slinking away. She glared at it, and it immediately ran over to lie down beside her.

Pei Qian crouched down and grabbed its snout, exclaiming, “Little brother, what’s wrong with you? Why are you so short? Are you a winter melon? How embarrassing! Speak up!” 

The dog, who had inexplicably gained a great fortune, was actually a mountain spirit, originally meant to roam the mountains of Longquan County. Now, it had become a formidable mountain spirit in its own right, especially with the backing of the Longquan Sword Sect. However, it still lacked the cultivation to speak human language or transform into a human form.

Pei Qian tightened her grip on the dog’s mouth. “Not speaking means you're disobedient, huh? Who gave you the courage?” 

The dog froze, too scared to move.

Pei Qian twisted her wrist, forcing the dog’s head to turn, and it began to whimper. “Now, tell me, are you bullying the big white geese in town again? Why do they always run away when I bring you along? Do you understand what ‘don’t let your fist go to waste’ means? You’re driving me crazy! After following me into the Jianghu for so long, you haven’t learned anything!”

The yellow dog seemed to want to die from shame.

Who was it that had once ridden a big white goose down the alleys?

Pei Qian finally released the dog and stood up, brushing her hands. Suddenly, she blinked hard and rubbed her eyes.

Since eating the pearl her master had given her in Qilong Alley, she often felt this way—her eyes felt sore, but it didn’t hurt; it was just annoying. It had caused her to mess up her calligraphy several times, leading to crooked strokes that required rewriting, which was one of her master’s few rules. She had always adhered to it, even though there was no one to oversee her writing anymore.

Whenever she glanced at her writing, it seemed like some characters were moving, but when she focused, everything appeared normal and orderly on the page.

Pei Qian planned to take the opportunity next time to visit Luopo Mountain with Sister Baoping and ask the old chef Zhu, who was always idle on the mountain. After all, he knew everything. If that didn’t work, she could always ask the mountain god, Wei Bo. If all else failed, she would have to seek out the old master on the second floor of the bamboo building, who would teach her martial arts at the slightest disagreement. He only relied on his age and strength, which was slightly more than her master’s, but what did he really know? He didn’t understand anything compared to her master!

Pei Qian strutted her way back to the town, proudly lifting her chin and not watching where she was going, declaring loudly, “Walk with swagger, make your enemies uneasy! Mad Sword Technique, unmatched in the world! If you’re my friend, I’ll slay the yellow dog, and you can have the meat while I drink the broth!”

The yellow dog, with its tail tucked between its legs, obediently followed behind the valiant Pei Qian.

The town grew increasingly lively, filled with many students from the Great Sui Academy speaking the refined dialect of the continent.

Li Huai led Liu Guan and Ma Lian to his home, which was in a dilapidated state. Liu Guan was fine with it, having come from a humble background, but Ma Lian was astounded, having seen poverty before but never a home that was bare and empty. Li Huai, however, was unfazed, pulling out his key to unlock the door, ushering them in to fetch water and clean the place. The town had more than one well; there were others nearby, but none compared to the sweetness of the water from the Iron Lock Well. Li Huai’s mother would only venture far to fetch water when good things happened at home or if she heard of misfortunes elsewhere, engaging with a group of women, including Aunt Ma from Apricot Blossom Alley and the widow Gu from Mud Bottle Alley.

Liu Guan was lazy and didn’t want to help, claiming he would tend to the fire and cook. So, Li Huai took Ma Lian to fetch water, but Ma Lian’s delicate shoulders suffered under the weight, causing the women by the well to chuckle at him, his face flushed with embarrassment.

Meanwhile, Li Baoping returned to the town, her mother’s tears flowing incessantly, causing Li Baoping to break down as well.

Leaving Fortune and Prosperity Street, she wandered down Qilong Alley, well-acquainted with the area. The two shops that now belonged to her little master uncle had originally been part of her family’s heritage. Li Baoping had spent many happy childhood days there, having grown up running through the town’s streets and alleys; she could navigate it with her eyes closed. However, this time, she walked slowly, no longer in a rush. 

As expected, she found Pei Qian waiting for her on a bench in the New Year’s shop. Li Baoping quickened her pace, spending some time in the shop before heading with Pei Qian to Mud Bottle Alley. They discovered her little master uncle’s ancestral home was clean enough not to need tidying, so Li Baoping decided to bring Pei Qian back to Fortune and Prosperity Street.

Pei Qian crouched beside a small water pond, her eyes wide as she observed the stones and the golden crucian carp that had reportedly thrived there for many years— a gift from her little master uncle. Nearby, a golden crab, which Li Baoping had caught herself, also resided in the water. The truth was that, long ago, the little girl in the red cotton jacket had pinched its claw, crying her way home to her elder brother, Li Xisheng, who had to pry it open for her.

Pei Qian stared for a long time, but the two little creatures seemed to be playing hard to get, hiding from view.

The small water pond had been painstakingly created by Li Baoping when she was very young. She had personally collected colorful stones from the creek, making sure to pick only the most beautiful ones. After many efforts, the stones were piled into a small mountain at the corner, eventually forming the pond. Now, the colorful stones that had once been legends of “national merit” had faded and lost their luster, but many remained translucent and sparkling under the sunlight, radiating vibrant energy.

Lin Shouyi visited the kiln supervisor’s office, reminiscing about his childhood there.

The Lin family was a prominent clan in the town, though not among the Four Great Families, and they were not well-known, preferring to avoid interactions with neighbors. Lin Shouyi’s father was merely a low-ranking official in the kiln supervisor’s office and had served under three supervisors before the family moved away from the Li Pearl Cave Heaven. Yet, it seemed no one had ever intended to promote him.

The Lin family had relocated to the Great Li capital, but their old home remained untouched, inhabited only by a few old servants.

Since he became aware, Lin Shouyi had not harbored much hope for his family.

It seemed the family felt the same way about him.

The mutual disdain was palpable.

Even though Lin Shouyi’s achievements at the academy had gradually spread to the Great Li, the family remained indifferent.

Lin Shouyi didn’t find this odd. His father had always been like that; once he set his mind on something, anyone’s words or actions that didn’t align with his thoughts were wrong. His mother, too, always stood by her husband’s side, her gaze toward her son colder than that of a stranger, treating him like someone merely staying in the Lin family, neither a guest nor a relative. 

Lin Shouyi recognized those former colleagues of his father’s at the office, and he visited them out of courtesy. Their conversations were brief, lacking substance, and he had never been good at socializing.

Today, it was said that the kiln supervisor had gone out for a stroll. According to the office clerks, there was no doubt that Supervisor Cao was out drinking.

Lin Shouyi felt somewhat curious as he noticed that both officials and clerks spoke about the supervisor with casual familiarity, expressing themselves freely.

At that moment, Yu Lu and Xie Xie went to the Cao family ancestral home. After their identities had been exposed, they had both been brought here to serve under the handsome young man named Cui Ci, who was favored by the national master, Cui Zhan.

The Cao family was a prominent family in the Great Li, with their descendant, the current kiln supervisor of Longquan County, residing here.

Today, having indulged in a bit too much alcohol, Supervisor Cao simply decided not to go to the office. Here, he was the highest authority, so he could do as he pleased. With an empty wine jug in hand and reeking of alcohol, he staggered back to the ancestral home, planning to take a nap. Along the way, he greeted everyone he met, addressing them correctly, whether they were old or young, men or women. When he spotted a child wearing open-crotch pants, he playfully kicked him, and the child, unafraid of the official, chased after him, spitting. Supervisor Cao, while running and dodging, was met with laughter from the women and girls watching the scene, all smiling at the young official.

After finally shaking off the troublesome child, Supervisor Cao encountered Yu Lu and Xie Xie. Whether he recognized them or guessed their identities, the charmingly tipsy Supervisor Cao asked Yu Lu if he wanted to drink. Yu Lu replied he could manage a little, and Supervisor Cao shook his empty jug, tossing the keys to him before dashing off to the tavern. Yu Lu had no choice but to follow, and Xie Xie asked, “Is this really the future head of the Cao family?”

Yu Lu chuckled, “That’s the only way, isn’t it?”

Xie Xie snorted derisively.

In contrast to the cultured and diligent Yuan County magistrate, Supervisor Cao was famously carefree. He had merely skimmed through the various dragon kilns and never returned. However, in the town and county, he often flitted from one to the other, enjoying drinks and idle chatter. Whenever Supervisor Cao appeared, a crowd of local men gathered around him to drink and listen to his stories from the capital—truth or fiction, who cared? They just sought lively entertainment. And when he got tipsy, he would often declare, “Today, I’ll cover the bill!”

Women and young ladies adored the charming young official.

In the hearts of the town’s women, his popularity rivaled that of a young diviner who once set up shop here.

Atop Cloudy Mountain, Mao Xiaodong initiated a greeting with the Deer Academy, allowing the scholars from the Great Sui to finally see the prince Gao Xuan, who was studying there.

Otherwise, no one dared speak up. It wasn’t that they feared trouble; they could all muster the courage to teach at the Mountain Cliff Academy; it was a matter of concern for Gao Xuan, who had come to serve as a hostage in place of his elder brother from the Great Sui’s Geyang family!

After the introductions, Mao Xiaodong took his leave.

The elder of the Geyang Gao family, a figure of considerable influence at the eleventh realm, did not make an appearance.

Gao Xuan watched as the venerable scholars from the Great Sui bowed respectfully to him, tears streaming down their faces. While he had initially thought nothing of his situation here, he now felt a lump in his throat, realizing the gravity of it all.

As a junior scholar, Gao Xuan respectfully returned the bow to these esteemed elders from the Great Sui.

The old scholars, straightening their robes, stood solemnly to receive his respect.

At the scenic point known as *Haoran Pavilion* at the Deer Academy, Gao Xuan’s ancestor from the Geyang family stood with Mao Xiaodong and the old turtle, Cheng Shui Dong.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, the elder took his leave.

He wasn’t serving as a vice-headmaster at the Deer Academy but had chosen to conceal his identity, teaching as an ordinary instructor. The academy’s students enjoyed his lessons because he shared stories beyond textbooks, including the tales of bizarre authors and the peculiarities of the Bai Paper Blessed Land. However, the local scholars from the Great Li weren’t fond of this “unorthodox” elder, considering his teaching style too frivolous and lacking seriousness. Yet, the vice-headmasters never raised objections, allowing the local teachers to remain unperturbed.

Only two vice-headmasters from different academies remained in *Haoran Pavilion*. Cheng Shui Dong seemed to be an old acquaintance of Mao Xiaodong, conversing freely.

Old Jiao and Mao Xiaodong discussed various matters regarding the academies and mentioned Chen Ping'an from Luopo Mountain. Among the topics was a minor matter concerning a request to allow a couple from another land to reside at the Deer Academy—not via a message from Wei Bo, but through a personal visit asking for this vice-headmaster’s assistance.

Mao Xiaodong remarked with a stern expression, “At last, you’ve grasped some social etiquette.”

Old Jiao erupted in laughter.

At the summit of Cloudy Mountain, a man and a woman stood together, admiring the breathtaking scenery of the mountains.

It was Liu Qingshan and his fiancée, the female swordmaster Liu Boqi.

Liu Qingshan spoke, “Once we visit the Great Li capital and the shores of Baoping Continent, we’ll return home. We should check on our father and my elder brother.”

Liu Boqi nodded gently, her cheeks slightly flushed.

According to their original agreement, the day of their return home would also mark their wedding day.

In Liu Boqi’s eyes, Liu Qingshan was like a green mountain, evergreen through the seasons—a spring mountain, vibrant with life. 

He was well-read, concerned for his country and people, sincere in his dealings, and charming as a scholar… he had no flaws.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 542: I Heard You Want to Ask About the Sword (Part 2)

But she was a cultivator, plain in appearance, skilled only in fighting and killing, lacking elegance in speech, drinking tea as if it were liquor, and knowing nothing of the arts like music, chess, calligraphy, or painting. It seemed she was full of flaws.

In truth, throughout their journey together, she had always worried about the future separation—not that Liu Qingshan would eventually grow old and die as an ordinary mortal. Instead, she feared that one day, Liu Qingshan would suddenly grow tired of her, realizing she wasn’t worth his enduring affection until they were both gray-haired.

Liu Boqi was filled with anxiety. It wasn’t until they arrived at that dilapidated mountain that the words of the old man, Master Zhu, struck a chord within her.

"I see the green mountains are enchanting; I believe the green mountains see me similarly."

How Liu Boqi viewed Liu Qingshan, how much she liked him, Liu Qingshan would reflect that back at her.

However, Liu Boqi still wanted to confirm this directly. Summoning her courage, she turned to Liu Qingshan, feeling quite nervous, gripping the hilt of her dagger, the Beast God tightly at her waist, and said, "Qingshan, I want to ask you something. You mustn’t think I’m foolish, nor are you allowed to laugh at me..."

Before Liu Boqi could continue, Liu Qingshan gently took her hand—the one that gripped the dagger—held it in both of his, and smiled, "Do you know how beautiful you are in my eyes? It’s beyond what you can possibly imagine."

Liu Boqi lowered her head slightly, her eyelashes fluttering.

Liu Qingshan continued softly, "It’s my fault; I should have told you earlier. If Master Zhu hadn’t reminded me and awakened me from my dream, it might have taken me longer—maybe until we returned to Lion Garden—to confess my feelings to you."

Liu Boqi raised her head, her heart unburdened. No trace of shyness remained in her eyes; only a faint blush on her cheeks revealed the ripples of her heart's turmoil.

Liu Boqi whispered, "It’s such a pity that Master Zhu has fallen to the point of guarding the Chen family's gate."

Liu Qingshan couldn't help but chuckle.

He wanted to speak in defense of Chen Pingan but was suddenly reminded of Master Zhu’s teachings.

In matters of great importance, one should be unwavering, but why quibble over trivial matters with a beloved woman? Were you marrying a wife or taking on a disciple as a teacher?

Liu Qingshan felt that Master Zhu truly was a towering figure, imparting golden wisdom in every word. Before leaving Longquan County, he must seek out Master Zhu for more advice.

In Yang’s shop, a young boy who was both a shop assistant and a disciple of Old Man Yang felt that life was unbearable. The shop's feng shui was poor, and it seemed to be at odds with money.

It wouldn’t do for business to remain so bleak. Named Shi Lingshan, the boy decided he had to do something filial, so he took the initiative to visit his uncle, who worked in the supervising office, to inquire if he could help attract some customers. However, he was met with a scolding, as his uncle berated him, saying that the shop and the Yang family now had a terrible reputation, and who would dare visit?

Defeated, the boy returned to the shop, only to find his senior brother, Zheng Dafu, sitting at the entrance, munching on a candied hawthorn skewer in an annoyingly indulgent manner. Usually, Shi Lingshan would ignore him, but since his senior sister was chatting with Zheng Dafu, he immediately felt a surge of anger. He plopped down on the steps between two small stools, and Zheng Dafu, smiling, said, "Lingshan, did you step in dog poop on Taoye Alley? Your face doesn’t look too good."

Shi Lingshan snapped, "Mind your own business, go back to your fallen mountain and guard your door."

Zheng Dafu, with a kind smile, ruffled the boy's hair, shaking him around before swatting him away, and continued munching on his candied hawthorn, mumbling, "I’m doing well now; I have a house over in the Fallen Mountain, much bigger than the yellow mud house by East Gate. When are you coming to visit?"

Shi Lingshan retorted, "Visit? What’s the point? We still have to run this shop."

Zheng Dafu sighed, "What a pity. The new house has two rooms and the beds are huge and sturdy; they make no noise when you roll around. I wanted to invite you and Su girl over for a night. It’s a new house, it needs some liveliness—have a meal, drink a bit of wine, but if you’re too far away, that’s fine. Su girl agreed to come, which is good; two people in two rooms, no need to squeeze on the bed."

Shi Lingshan felt a pang of regret.

The girl Zheng Dafu referred to as "Su girl" said nothing, even though he hadn’t mentioned anything to her before. She didn’t refute him at all.

Just moments ago, she had sought Zheng Dafu's advice on her martial arts doubts. Although Zheng Dafu's martial arts were lacking, his knowledge was still considerable, and she had no intention of underestimating him.

Compared to the boy from Taoye Alley, who had yet to truly practice, she had been exposed to many secrets and intricacies much earlier, and her horizons had broadened. This made her indifferent to the trifling matters of the shop.

Yet just as she was about to ask Zheng Dafu a question, she was distracted by the lingering sensation of a strange incident that had aroused her subtle awareness.

Zheng Dafu said, "Shi Lingshan, what are you dawdling for? Go grab some food to honor your senior brother."

Shi Lingshan sat on the steps between her senior brother and senior sister without moving.

The girl, however, went inside the shop to fetch some food.

Zheng Dafu slapped his palm, "What a fool! You’re just waiting to be single for life."

Shi Lingshan stood up, fuming, "Watch it, or I’ll get angry!"

Zheng Dafu stroked his chin, "Su girl is so beautiful; there will definitely be many men vying to marry her. Alas, I wonder which fool will have that fortune, to spar with Su girl at night. As your senior brother, just thinking about that day makes me feel a bit weary. Luckily, Su girl listens to me, so I’m sure when she’s overwhelmed with choices, she’ll still turn to me to help her decide..."

Shi Lingshan was immediately caught in a whirlwind of emotions, as if covered in mud by this senior brother’s words.

She turned to glance inside the shop, where her senior sister, Su Dian, was on tiptoe, reaching into the medicine cabinet for something. There were some medicinal herbs in the shop that were edible.

As she stretched and leaned, her figure appeared even more slender.

Shi Lingshan quickly turned her head and plopped back down on the steps.

Her senior sister's real name was Su Dian, with the nickname "Rouzhi." It was said that her greatest childhood dream was to open a small shop selling rouge and powder, a name given by her uncle, and the nickname was also from her uncle, showing how little she cared.

At that moment, a young boy with a package on his back ran over from the small town.

Zheng Dafu wiped his face, realizing he was in trouble again, having encountered this ungrateful brat from his childhood. How much trouble had he caused him back then at his sister’s place?

Li Huai ran to the shop entrance, grinning, "Hey, isn’t this Dafu? Soaking up the sun? Where’s your wife? Tell the aunties not to hide, come out and see me. I heard you married seven or eight wives. You’re doing well!"

Why bring up the past?

Zheng Dafu grumbled, "Get lost!"

Li Huai laughed and dashed into the pharmacy, heading straight for the back courtyard, shouting, "Old Yang, Old Yang, guess what I brought for you?!"

In the back courtyard, Old Man Yang looked up at Li Huai.

Li Huai tossed the package directly into the house that Zheng Dafu, Su Dian, and Shi Lingshan considered a forbidden place, then ran over to Old Man Yang and produced a jar, "Top-notch tobacco bought from a hundred-year-old shop in Daxui Capital! Eight coins for a tael, how about that? Are you impressed? Just wait until you smoke it, remember my name, and don’t forget my parents and sister either!"

The boy held out the jar of tobacco, raising both hands with eight fingers wiggling.

Zheng Dafu moved a stool to the back courtyard to watch the show.

Shi Lingshan followed suit, curious about where this brat came from, wondering how he could be so disrespectful, casually chatting with Zheng Dafu, let alone showing no respect to his own master.

Su Dian hesitated for a moment, then stood by the bamboo curtain.

Old Man Yang's wrinkled face squeezed out a smile, but his mouth still held no kind words, "Leave the tobacco, and you go wait over there, brat. At your age, not wearing a split-crotch pant anymore? Don’t you find it troublesome to defecate and urinate?"

Li Huai skipped behind Old Man Yang and smacked him on the back of the head, "A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory, say that in front of my mother and see what happens. Looking for a beating?"

Old Man Yang surprisingly didn’t get angry and skillfully packed the tobacco, starting to puff clouds of smoke. But then his expression darkened, and he spat, cursing, "I’ll smash that shop’s sign later; what a pile of junk, not worth the price."

Li Huai laughed, "I can’t do that! Eight coins for a tael of their prized possession? I can’t afford it. It’s still on display in their shop! I wanted to buy it, but they wouldn’t sell it to me. I just bought something cheaper, you know—it's the thought that counts! I’ve come a long way with this tobacco. Old Yang, you like to lounge around, don’t you know how far I’ve traveled? You should get out more, you never know, you might just meet an old woman you fancy. If that happens, I’ll be drinking your wedding wine!"

Old Man Yang shot a glance at Li Huai, about to scold him.

Li Huai covered his ears and shook his head, "Old Yang, the turtle loves to chant scriptures, Li Huai doesn’t listen, doesn’t listen."

Seeing this scene, Zheng Dafu's eyelids and mouth twitched in disbelief.

It had been so many years since he had heard his sister-in-law’s scolding and seen Li Huai’s antics.

Su Dian and Shi Lingshan were equally astounded, the boy swallowed hard. They had no idea who this brazen young scholar was.

After all, Shi Lingshan only knew Zheng Dafu as the only slacker senior brother in town, and she hadn’t even heard of Li Er’s name.

But this unknown young scholar was truly audacious.

Shi Lingshan felt she had never had such courage in her life.

If she had seen the pharmacy’s bustling past, she would have found it even more unbelievable.

When Li Er was still working as an assistant in the pharmacy, Li Huai used to sneak away from his mother to play around here, and if he fell, he would roll around in the mud, returning home covered in dirt. When his mother saw him, she would feel heartbreak—not just for his clothes but for her messy son, and she would drag him back here to scold the earth and the sky, cursing everything.

And that was nothing; when Li Huai wore split-crotch pants, he couldn’t hold his urine and would spray all over the back courtyard of Old Man Yang’s hill.

Even someone as dull as Li Er felt guilty towards his master and apologized several times. However, Old Man Yang never held a grudge, and Li Er went along with it. Old Man Yang would just lightly tap the little rascal with his smoking pipe.

Li Huai found it odd that when he fell and cried, he would be scolded or lightly "beaten" with the smoking pipe by Old Man Yang, but he never bore a grudge and continued to laugh foolishly. Of course, after exhausting himself, he would quietly sit beside Old Man Yang, resting his chin on his hands, watching the old man puffing clouds of smoke, and would sit there for a long time.

Li Huai squatted next to Old Man Yang and whispered in his ear, "Old Yang, do you have any valuable heirlooms to spare? You don’t seem like the type to marry and have kids, so they’ll just be left for me. It doesn’t matter if you give them to me early or late, right?"

Old Man Yang shook his head, "There are a few things I could leave for you, but let’s talk about it later."

Li Huai sighed, "Don’t let it be too late. Who knows when my sister will get married? Our family is poor; we might just end up being looked down upon by her future in-laws. I’m relying on you to help me with that."

Old Man Yang tugged at the corners of his mouth.

Li Huai suddenly turned around, "Old Yang, you should smoke less in the future. At your age, you should take care of your health—eat lighter, go out more often, don’t just sit here waiting to die. I see you’re in good shape; you could climb a mountain and gather herbs without issue. Alright, chatting with you is so dull; I’m off. The package has new clothes and shoes, remember to change into them."

Without hesitation, Li Huai left.

Of course, he didn’t forget to curse Zheng Dafu once more before bidding farewell with a smile to Shi Lingshan and Su Dian.

The closeness or distance was obvious; it was just the reverse.

The ancient temple was about seven hundred miles away from the Sword Water Mountain Villa in the Shushui Kingdom.

Back then, they had to walk, which was slow. However, when Chen Pingan traveled by sword, it was much faster.

Instead of heading directly to the villa, he landed on a high mountain first, still over a hundred miles from the bustling town. As he looked down at the rivers and mountains, he noticed something unusual—not only were the mountains and waters beautiful, but there was also mist swirling like a veil around one of the peaks. Just as Chen Pingan landed on the mountain top and sheathed his sword, a deity of the land, likely in charge of that area, appeared, bowing and greeting him, calling him "Immortal Master."

Chen Pingan took off his bamboo hat, hurriedly cupped his fists in return, and smiled, "I’m just passing through; there’s no need for such formality, Lord of the Land."

In the customs of his hometown in Longquan County, when a relative passed away, they would select a burial site on the mountain and needed to place stones and paper money at specific spots, essentially renting the mountain from the land deity until the funeral was completed. Along the way, they would scatter paper money, as it was said to buy passage for their loved ones through the gates of hell and along the road to the underworld.

Chen Pingan remembered this vividly. The first time he left the small town, he encountered the land deity, Wei Ban, who was then still "detained" in Chesspile Mountain. At that time, Chen Pingan had felt quite lost.

At that moment, the middle-aged land deity, not daring to linger, expressed his respect and, after a brief exchange, was about to take his leave.

After all, the man before him was evidently a sword immortal, and a mere land deity couldn’t afford to cling to him. If he were just an average fifth realm cultivator, he wouldn’t want to miss this opportunity.

Chen Pingan took out a flask of Wu Ti wine and handed it to the somewhat apprehensive land deity, "This wine is a token for my impromptu visit to the mountain."

The land deity, not even worthy of having his name recorded in the Shushui Kingdom’s geography annals, immediately became flustered, hurrying to accept the flask of celestial wine, realizing that it was no ordinary earthly drink just by its weight.

Chen Pingan took out his sword-raising gourd and sipped the home-brewed liquor from the old lady’s ancient house, then asked, "Lord of the Land, I’m visiting the Sword Water Mountain Villa to see a friend. I wonder how the villa has been over the past ten years?"

The land deity cautiously brewed his response, hoping for no mistakes, and slowly said, "To report to the Immortal Master, the Sword Water Mountain Villa is no longer the foremost sect in the Shushui Kingdom. It has been replaced by the Horizontal Sword Villa led by Master Wang Yiran. Although he is a junior to the Sword Saint Song, he has become the leader of the martial arts world in Shushui, according to current rumors. It’s only a matter of time before Master Wang and Sword Saint Song face off. First, Master Wang successfully broke through and truly became a top-tier Grandmaster, with his swordsmanship reaching divine mastery. Second, Master Wang’s daughter married the son of a wealthy family in Shushui. Moreover, the Horizontal Sword Villa was the first to pledge allegiance during the Great Li’s iron cavalry’s southern campaign. In contrast, our Sword Water Mountain Villa, with its martial spirit, refuses to subordinate to anyone, and gradually finds itself in a weaker position..."

At this point, the land deity hesitated, seemingly hiding something.

Chen Pingan urged, "You can speak freely, Lord of the Land."

The man lowered his voice and said, "The court plans to relocate the Sword Water Mountain Villa to build the highest mountain god temple beneath the Five Mountains, purportedly initiated by General Chu Hao."

Chen Pingan took a sip of wine and laughed, "Isn’t that the Chu Hao who recognized the Great Li’s prince as his ancestor in military strategy?"

Whether Wang Yiran or Chu Hao, they were all familiar figures.

Wang Yiran was a good man; although his daughter Wang Shanshu was not as remarkable as him, Wang Yiran’s actions during that tumultuous period were indeed worthy of the title of hero.

As for Chu Hao, who fought alongside Sword Saint Song on the battlefield, Chen Pingan had no grievances to seek against him; the resentments of the battlefield and the martial world were now two separate matters.

However, now that it was brought up, Chen Pingan certainly wouldn’t hold back.

The land deity chuckled, knowing that too many words could lead to mistakes. As long as his meaning got across, it was enough. After all, he was just a small land deity in Shushui; Chu Hao was now a figure with authority beneath one and above ten thousand in the Shushui court, not to mention the “Great Shushui Taishang Emperor” stationed officials.

Chen Pingan donned his bamboo hat, secured his sword-raising gourd, and once again cupped his fists in gratitude.

The land deity hurriedly bowed, holding the flask of wine, "Immortal Master, you’re too courteous."

Chen Pingan flew away from the mountain top.

The land deity suppressed his surprise and wondered, "How could Song Yushao, merely a martial man, be acquainted with such a sword immortal?"

Outside the small town adjacent to the Sword Water Mountain Villa, on a secluded hill, Chen Pingan sheathed his sword and descended the mountain, walking slowly along the official road.

After passing the small town, he arrived at the entrance of the Sword Water Mountain Villa.

Chen Pingan removed his bamboo hat and smiled at an elderly gatekeeper, "Could you please inform Sword Saint Song that Chen Pingan has come to invite him for hotpot?"

The old gatekeeper hesitated, glancing at the young man, who appeared to be a swordsman with a sword and a wine gourd hanging at his waist. He seemed to be a member of the martial world, but as he was unfamiliar, the old man hadn’t heard his name before. This young man likely wasn’t a friend of the villa and arriving at this time was rather unfortunate.

Thus, the old man apologetically said, "Young man, our villa is currently not seeing any guests. You might as well leave."

Chen Pingan had no choice but to explain his friendship with Elder Song, emphasizing that he was indeed a friend, having stayed at the villa for a period, practicing his fist techniques by the waterfall at the mountain water pavilion.

The Sword Water Mountain Villa had strict rules, and the old gatekeeper guarded his territory fiercely, disinclined to inquire further. Moreover, Chen Pingan had been designated as a forbidden visitor by Song Yushao at the waterfall, so the old gatekeeper genuinely hadn’t heard of him. 

The key issue was that although the old man believed he was aging, he still had sharp eyes and a good memory. He could recall the names of friends he had seen before. However, he truly didn’t recognize Chen Pingan; he had never seen him!

Thus, the old gatekeeper cautiously moved to block the side door, preventing this young and overly confident swordsman from barging in. The villa was not peaceful at the moment, and they faced significant external threats. However, the old man believed that this situation would be similar to the last time the imperial army approached; as long as the old master was present, they would weather any storm.

Yet, deep down, the old man was still filled with worry. After all, General Chu Hao, who often liked to compete with the villa, had not only risen in rank but had also become a powerful figure compared to when he was just an ordinary border general.

Moreover, the swiftly rising Horizontal Sword Villa was supposed to be an ally of the Sword Water Mountain Villa, but the martial world was filled with unfortunate rivalries, and everyone sought to claim the top spot. The Qingzhu Swordsman Su Lang had recently killed the sword technique master Lin Gushan from the Gu Yu Kingdom, with the weapon “Green Pearl” hanging at Su Lang’s waist as proof. Now, Su Lang believed his swordsmanship had reached its peak and was eager to compete for the title of the top swordsman with the old master, while Wang Yiran was vying for the title of the top martial artist in Shushui Kingdom.

It was the same with the two villas, which were essentially two factions competing against each other.

Even among their own villa, it was hard to say whether Su Lang or Wang Yiran could be considered bad people.

Regardless, having reached the entrance of the Sword Water Mountain Villa, Chen Pingan didn’t feel so anxious anymore. He patiently exchanged words with the old gatekeeper.

As their conversation went back and forth, the old gatekeeper seemed to confirm that this young martial artist, despite his penchant for nonsensical chatter, was not a bad person. So he blocked the entrance and engaged in conversation, while the old man held some internal misgivings. 

This young man, with no sharp wit, had spent half the time talking nonsense while drinking from the flask, neglecting to ask the old man if he wanted a drink. Even a simple gesture of politeness would have been appreciated. He wouldn’t actually drink from the boy’s flask, as he was on duty and couldn’t indulge.

Moreover, the wine brewed by his own villa was quite good; why would he crave the mediocre liquor in that broken flask? The question of whether to drink or not was one thing, but whether this young man asked him was another.

Chen Pingan, of course, had his own difficulties. His sword-raising gourd had merely performed a sleight of hand, and once the old man took it, the ruse would be exposed. Chen Pingan couldn’t just "magically produce" a flask of Wu Ti wine from thin air, nor could he bear to part with it. After all, they were strangers, and it wasn’t customary to offer wine to just anyone.

The old gatekeeper, having nothing to do, began to lament how the young man was lacking in manners while also indulging in some idle gossip about the entire Shushui Kingdom.

In the court, Chu Hao had already issued a warning that if the Sword Water Mountain Villa didn’t relocate within a month, they would face the consequences.

Wang Yiran, on the other hand, had been gracious enough not to cause trouble at the villa, only preparing to host a martial arts conference, inviting various heroes to the Horizontal Sword Villa to join in the festivities.

As for the Qingzhu Swordsman Su Lang, he was set to come here to "ask about swords" from the old master, and his intentions were likely not friendly. If he truly didn’t have some confidence, he wouldn’t dare to play around with such matters.

The old gatekeeper also mentioned that he had already declined Su Lang’s challenge, but the young swordsman was still hot-headed, declaring to the Shushui Kingdom’s martial world that he would certainly pay a visit to the Sword Water Mountain Villa.

Upon hearing this, Chen Pingan fell silent.

He had crossed swords with Su Lang twice before, but for some reason, Su Lang had turned against him at the last moment, severing the head of Lin Gushan, who should have been an ally.

The old gatekeeper sighed, "Now that you know why I wouldn’t let you in, right? If it were any other time, I would have let you in. Our Sword Water Mountain Villa isn’t short on fine wines to entertain guests, but this isn’t the peaceful time it used to be. Who knows if there are spies from the court observing from the small town? If you step in and then come back out, it would be hard to explain. Think carefully, young man; is it worth it to seek fame in the martial world and invite trouble upon yourself? Why bother, just leave."

Suddenly, Chen Pingan turned his gaze toward the inside of the villa, prompting the old gatekeeper to follow suit, thinking someone from inside was approaching.

Yet, there was no one in sight.

By the time the old gatekeeper returned his attention, the young man had already handed him a flask of wine, smiling, "Old sir, with your well-meaning advice, you should accept this flask of wine."

The old man was puzzled about why the young man had looked so intently before but didn’t think much of it. He thought to himself that this young man had some potential in the martial world; otherwise, someone so naïve wouldn’t make it far. The old man still shook his head, "If I take your wine after blocking you from entering for so long, wouldn’t that weigh on my conscience? Just keep it for yourself. Besides, I’m the gatekeeper. I can’t drink wine right now."

Chen Pingan peeled off the clay seal and shook the flask, "Really not going to drink?"

The old gatekeeper was tempted, but he didn’t take it. Regardless of how good the wine was, it was against the rules, and he couldn’t accept it. 

However, the young man suddenly donned his bamboo hat, shoved the flask into his hands, and turned to leave the steps, laughing, "It seems someone is coming. I’ll go ahead and inform the old sir to save him the trouble of coming here to seek fame."

The old gatekeeper held the flask, looking down the road, but there was no sign of anyone.

As the young man continued to walk away, the old gatekeeper couldn’t help but feel both amused and helpless. After all, he was still a young man, with a thin skin; after being turned away, he had to come up with such a flimsy excuse to save face.

The old man sighed, feeling a pang of sympathy. 

But this was the way of the martial world; he had originally planned to inform the young man, who pretended to be a swordsman, to come back when the villa was peaceful, and he wouldn’t block him then.

Yet after hesitating, the old gatekeeper swallowed those words back down.

For a young man venturing into the martial world, facing setbacks wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.

Nearby the bustling town close to the Sword Water Mountain Villa, in a high-class room of a tavern, sat a "young man" who was actually well past the age of reason but had grown increasingly handsome over the years. Ten years ago, he had seemed to be entering adulthood; now, he looked like a youth in his prime.

He sat cross-legged on a mat, meticulously polishing a long sword from its sheath. The scabbard lay across his knees, inscribed with the words "Green Pearl." It was once the beloved sword of Lin Gushan, the first swordsman of the Gu Yu Kingdom. After Lin Gushan lost his head, this sword became his.

This man also had a section of glossy, shimmering green bamboo hanging at his waist, measuring two feet six inches, equal in length to his sword.

As a young swordsman donned in a bamboo hat and carrying a long sword left the small town, a beautiful woman who had journeyed from the Songxi Kingdom alongside him approached the door and knocked, her tone soft, "Master, someone has finally come to visit the Sword Water Mountain Villa."

They had been here for nearly ten days, and the man had instructed her to wait until someone went to the desolate Sword Water Mountain Villa, which would signal the time for him to draw his sword.

She had been waiting atop the highest point of the town for that person’s appearance.

She had begun to grow impatient, firmly believing that after this duel with Song Yushao, her master would surely gain fame across Shushui, Songxi, and Caiyi!

However, as she waited for nearly ten days, no martial artist had yet approached the Sword Water Mountain Villa.

The man inside smiled, "Very good."

The sword attendant retreated.

Leaping onto a roof with a curved eave, her heart raced with excitement, awaiting her master’s duel and the moment he would draw his sword.

That sword strike would surely be a breathtaking display, unmatched in the martial world!

Because the man inside was none other than Su Lang, the Qingzhu Swordsman!

Su Lang remained seated, not hurrying to rise, still focused on polishing the "Green Pearl" sword.

Polishing the sword edge was inherently a way of nurturing sword intent, continuously accumulating it.

The sword attendant felt that time was dragging on. She glanced at the Sword Water Mountain Villa, fearing that Song Yushao might suddenly run off, then looked back toward the tavern, hoping her master’s figure would appear soon.

Finally, Su Lang, now donned in a green long robe, stepped out of the tavern, standing in the bustling street that led directly to the Sword Water Mountain Villa.

With the green bamboo that signified his transcendent status at his waist, Su Lang held the Green Pearl sword.

On the street, the sword intent surged like a tidal wave.

The pedestrians scattered in fear.

Then someone shouted out Su Lang’s name, which triggered a cacophony of surprised voices that echoed throughout the street.

Many eager onlookers either climbed to higher ground or, like the sword attendant, scrambled onto rooftops to watch. Among them were some serious-looking men and women positioned at various spots in the town, who contrasted sharply with the bustling crowd of excited spectators; they were spies and assassins embedded in Shushui Kingdom.

The girl stood atop the most expansive roof, coldly smirking.

Su Lang took his first step forward.

The sword intent radiated in all directions.

With the second step, he crossed a full yard.

Some bystanders along the street, still lingering on both sides, began to feel suffocated and rushed into shops, gasping for breath.

When the renowned sword saint took his third step, he covered several yards in one stride.

Even distant spies and assassins planted in the town, observing from afar, were shaken to the core, astonished by such a formidable sword intent.

On the fourth step, he departed the town’s archway.

His entire being was now elevated to the pinnacle of his martial arts.

But at that moment, Su Lang halted.

A young swordsman in a bamboo hat approached from a distance.

Su Lang’s decision to stop, rather than proceed toward the Sword Water Mountain Villa to challenge Song Yushao, was due to the sudden appearance of this unexpected guest. For the briefest moment, Su Lang felt as if the man’s presence had disrupted his otherwise flawless state of mind and momentum.

So, Su Lang chose to stand still.

However, the man merely took “one step” and reached Su Lang’s front.

Su Lang had never feared close combat, especially against a mountain cultivator; it was even better.

This young man looked quite young.

"Didn’t I hear that you want to ask about swords?" he asked. "But didn’t Elder Song already clearly refuse your challenge? For a martial elder like him, that carries significant meaning. Are you going to push your luck?"

Su Lang found such naive questions increasingly ridiculous. Someone who could temporarily obstruct his path shouldn’t be asking such foolish things.

The man hesitated for a moment, "Is it just a matter of having a reason, regardless of whether it's right or wrong, to act as you please?"

Su Lang smiled, "Then you should find a reason too."

Surprisingly, the young man actually pondered this, then adjusted his bamboo hat, chuckling, "I’ve thought of one: you’re wasting my time, I was supposed to invite Elder Song for hotpot."

Su Lang had regained his immaculate state of mind and slowly replied, "Then try to see if you can block my sword."

After a punch was thrown, Chen Pingan didn’t even have to use his dimensional shrinking talisman.

The renowned Qingzhu Swordsman was sent flying straight back to the tavern he had just left.

Chen Pingan didn’t even glance back, turning to return to the Sword Water Mountain Villa, muttering to himself, "That should be the newly arrived seventh realm? No wonder he felt as flimsy as paper."

Returning to the Sword Water Mountain Villa, the old gatekeeper was bewildered, as not only had the old master appeared, but the young master and his wife had also come. 

Everyone’s expressions were grave.

Could it be that the Qingzhu Swordsman had shown himself?

However, the old gatekeeper only saw the returning green-clad swordsman, and he couldn’t help but chuckle, "Oh dear, this young man has quite the thick skin! But fine, since he brought such good wine, I won’t hold it against him. Besides, in the martial world, sometimes having a thick skin can be beneficial."

In the old gatekeeper’s line of sight, the young man who was approaching the gate was now jogging, starting to wave from a distance, "Elder Song, want some hotpot?"

The old gatekeeper wiped his face, "Young man, that’s a bit too shameless, isn’t it?"

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 543: A Small Matter Regarding a Bamboo Sword Sheath

Chen Ping'an arrived at the entrance and removed his bamboo hat.

Old Master Song was still dressed in a long black robe, but now he no longer carried a sword and appeared much older. 

The Sword Saint of the Shushui Kingdom stared in disbelief and asked with a heavy accent, "Is that you, Guawaar?"

Chen Ping'an nodded but then hesitated, ultimately ending with a nod. 

Song Yu Shao burst into hearty laughter and gave Chen Ping'an a firm pat on the shoulder. "Good heavens! You've grown so tall that I almost didn't recognize you! Why aren't you wearing straw sandals and carrying a bamboo box? Maybe I would have recognized you right away!"

Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "Going for hotpot?"

Song Yu Shao didn't answer the question; instead, he countered, "What's going on back in the town? Su Lang’s sword energy suddenly broke off. Is that related to you?"

Chen Ping'an confirmed, "I intercepted him and sent Su Lang back to the town. He shouldn't be bothering you anymore, Old Master."

He didn't fabricate a story, as Old Master Song was someone he deeply respected and was not easily fooled.

But often, the truth is stranger than fiction.  

The old steward didn't believe him, nor did Song Yu Shao’s grandson, Song Fengshan, and his wife, Liu Qian. Only Song Yu Shao seemed to believe him, grabbing Chen Ping'an's arm. "Since it's all settled, come on inside! There's no rush for hotpot. After we finish, you’ll settle up your debts and leave, and how could I stop you from going? Besides, I really couldn't stop you even if I tried."

Song Fengshan and Liu Qian exchanged glances.

The old steward could hardly swallow his saliva.

As Chen Ping'an was about to pass by the old steward, he stopped, took a step back, and said with a smile, "See, I told you I was familiar with your estate. Don't stop me next time; otherwise, I'll just climb over the wall."

The old steward laughed helplessly and cupped his hands in apology. "Young Master Chen, I was blind earlier and offended you."

Chen Ping'an made a gesture as if drinking. 

The old steward understood and gave Chen Ping'an a thumbs-up.

Song Yu Shao pulled Chen Ping'an inside.

Song Fengshan didn’t follow immediately but whispered, "Old Qi, what’s going on?"

The old steward then recounted the earlier incident, presenting his own embarrassing story with a chuckle.

Song Fengshan rubbed his forehead thoughtfully.

Liu Qian laughed, "Well, that's great! If it gets out, it’ll be a grand tale in the martial world."

The old steward laughed unabashedly.

In the hall of the mountain villa, everyone took their seats, and Liu Qian personally poured tea.

After taking a sip, Chen Ping'an curiously asked, "So Chu Hao didn’t die back then?"

Song Fengshan shook his head. "He died, without a doubt. But his identity was replaced by Han Yuanshan. Han Yuanshan is skilled in disguise, after all."

Chen Ping'an suddenly understood.

Back in the day, the first of the Shushui Kingdom's Four Evils—Wei Wei, the ghost of the ancient temple, and Han Yuanshan, the demonic figure killed by the sage Zhou Ju at Sword Water Mountain Villa—were all connected. The last one was none other than Song Fengshan's wife, Liu Qian.

Liu Qian acted for her husband, Song Fengshan, to elevate the reputation of Sword Water Mountain Villa. 

As for that young noble from the Han family, Han Yuanshan was ambitious and cunning, wishing to leverage the martial power of a nation to climb the political ladder. What Han Yuanshan ultimately wanted was unfathomable.

Chen Ping'an wasn’t surprised that Han Yuanshan could accomplish so much using Chu Hao's face and identity; he had already cast a shadow over the realms of the Shushui Kingdom. But Song Fengshan and Liu Qian, holding such a significant trump card, why was Han Yuanshan not genuinely Chu Hao? Why was he so aggressive against Sword Water Mountain Villa? Surely, they wouldn't be powerless to retaliate against him. Was Han Yuanshan not afraid that Sword Water Mountain Villa might expose his true identity?

Song Fengshan seemed to see through Chen Ping'an's doubts and smiled as he explained, "It's all just a show. It’s a business deal. ‘Chu Hao’ needs this to pave the way for the Hengdao Villa, to unify the martial world. Han Yuanshan knows that we at Sword Water Mountain Villa would never be their lackeys, so he started to support Wang Yiran of Hengdao Villa. We have no objections to that; Wang Yiran cares about the title of the number one sect in the martial world, but we don’t. We only want to use this opportunity to find a picturesque location and escape from the mundane troubles of the world. In exchange, Han Yuanshan will use the Shushui Kingdom’s court to allocate a piece of land for us to build a new estate. That place has been favored by my grandfather for its feng shui. Han Yuanshan will also strive to secure a river god's decree for my wife. I will decline all social engagements and refuse any martial world connections, and focus on practicing my sword."

Liu Qian was no ordinary woman; her status and intelligence were remarkable.

As long as the green hills remain, there’s no fear of running out of firewood.

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Taking a step back leaves a wide expanse ahead. Brother Song can focus on the sword path, and Sister-in-law can secure a lasting future. Moreover, having the ancestral land designated as a mountain god temple is no small merit; it will provide blessings and protection for the descendants. But the only thing to be cautious about is that you both need to come here occasionally to check in. If the new mountain god's incense isn't pure, you must sever ties early. Of course, that's the worst-case scenario."

Song Yu Shao and Song Fengshan exchanged smiles.

Chen Ping'an understood that he might have spoken out of turn. After all, both Old Master Song and Song Fengshan were quite familiar with the matters of the mountain. Especially Old Master Song, who loved to travel with his sword, otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to buy a sword for Song Fengshan at the Xianjia ferry of Di Long Mountain.

Chen Ping'an reminded himself not to rush; he would be staying at the villa for a few more days.

After all, these were private matters for the Song family, and as a newcomer, it was best not to ask too many questions. 

In Chen Ping'an's eyes, regardless of how others navigated the martial world, his own journey wouldn’t be about defeating Su Lang today, eating hotpot with Song Yu Shao tomorrow, and flying back north on his sword the day after. During this time, he thought of nothing else, as if the only things that mattered were the speed of his punches, the speed of his sword, drinking joyfully, enjoying hotpot, learning martial arts, and achieving some success. Life should be that simple, becoming increasingly carefree. 

But it shouldn’t be like that. 

Perhaps when he reached the unfamiliar Bei Ju Lu Zhou, things would be different, and he wouldn't have so many concerns. 

So after meeting, he could only ask more about others to indirectly understand the matters of the Song family. 

But one thing Chen Ping'an was very clear about was that being able to relinquish the ancestral business of the villa showed no small resolve, and the matter was significant. 

Especially since Old Master Song was willing to take that step; it was even less trivial. 

For the older generation of martial artists, face is more important than anything. Old Master Song was an old veteran, while Wang Yiran could also be considered one. However, Su Lang from Songxi Kingdom didn’t count.

Let’s not even talk about it; Su Lang's appearance in the town and drawing his sword was highly irregular. 

Because according to the age-old rules passed down in the martial world, since the Sword Saint of Shushui Kingdom publicly rejected Su Lang's challenge and offered no reason or excuse, nor suggested any postponement, it was equivalent to Song Yu Shao voluntarily relinquishing his title as the number one swordsman. It was akin to a chess player conceding a match without saying the words "I lost." 

For the old veterans like Song Yu Shao, what he handed over wasn't just a title; it included a lifetime of accumulated reputation and face—essentially half of his life.

Song Yu Shao merely smiled at Chen Ping'an, seeing that the little rascal from back then had grown up. He was curious, though, whether Chen Ping'an could drink more now or handle spicy food. He also wondered whether Chen Ping'an still believed that drinking could alleviate spiciness or if he had found another way. The old man was especially curious about that girl Chen Ping'an had been infatuated with back then—did they end up together, or did he get brushed off with a "You're a good person"?

After hearing Song Fengshan's seemingly reasonable explanation, Chen Ping'an grew curious and couldn’t help but ask, "So what’s the deal with Su Lang? I sensed he was preparing to draw his sword in the town, and it seemed absolutely certain he wanted to fight you to the death, not just to see who was better at swordsmanship."

This time, it was Song Yu Shao who came to clarify for Chen Ping'an: "The sword god of Caiyi Kingdom whom I respected most back in the day was probably at the same level as Su Lang now. Su Lang is exceptionally gifted; after breaking the mirror, he wants to find a sharpening stone to solidify his realm. Having seen through numerous kingdoms, I, Song Yu Shao, just happen to be adept with the sword, and my reputation is sufficient yet falls short of Su Lang by a realm… Well, you could say he is the best opponent for sharpening his sword."

Song Yu Shao wasn’t particularly interested in tea; he drank less now and only made exceptions during festivals. His grandchildren were strict, like guarding against thieves, so he had no choice but to drink the most bland of beverages, which was better than nothing.

The old man continued, "However, Su Lang’s ruckus put me in a difficult position. If I agree to a duel, whether I lose or die, it’s not a big deal, but it would ruin our business deal with Han Yuanshan."

As he spoke, Song Yu Shao took a sip of tea, and Liu Qian quickly got up to refill his cup.

Song Yu Shao complained, "Even if I drink a few cups of tea, it still lacks the essence of alcohol. Now that Chen Ping'an is here, receiving guests with tea isn’t appropriate."

Liu Qian had just sat down but remained standing since her grandfather asked a question, smiling, "Grandfather, this matter should be decided by Fengshan."

Song Fengshan put on a serious face and replied, "This Mid-Autumn Festival, Grandfather has already finished the drinks for the start of winter and the little New Year."

Song Yu Shao sighed, not insisting any further.

Chen Ping'an was pleased to see that the relationship between the grandfather and grandson had grown harmonious and was no longer as fraught with unspoken tensions as before.

Song Yu Shao continued the topic, a self-deprecating look on his face. "If I lose, given the character of the martial artists in the Shushui Kingdom, there will surely be countless people kicking me while I’m down. Even if we move, it won’t settle; everyone will want to take a shot at us, at the very least, spit a few times. If I die, Han Yuanshan might just directly go back on his word and let Wang Yiran swallow Sword Water Mountain Villa. What Sword Saint of Shushui Kingdom once held value now amounts to nothing. It’s just a pity that Su Lang is so aggressive; he gained the illusion and still wants to obtain something real. It’s human nature, but it goes against the old rules of the martial world. However, discussing old rules now is just laughable."

Song Fengshan hesitated before speaking.

Song Yu Shao waved his hand and laughed, "No need to overthink it; I’m just complaining a bit in front of Chen Ping'an. You know my temperament, right? If I really couldn’t let go of these superficial things, I wouldn’t have agreed to do business with Han Yuanshan. At the end of the day, I’m just not as good as the younger generation. If I can’t break through that bottleneck in my lifetime, it will give Su Lang the opportunity to surpass me. Who doesn’t want to monopolize the top spot? Who wants anyone beside them to compare?"

Song Yu Shao proactively said a few words about Su Lang, then lamented some matters about the martial world that had gone unheard. "In the past, among the martial artists of over a dozen kingdoms, the sword god of Caiyi Kingdom was the most respected. Even if Lin Gu Shan from the Gu Yu Kingdom didn’t know how to behave, even if I, Song Yu Shao, don’t deserve a place, I loved to travel far and wide. Su Lang is ambitious and full of spirit; regardless of whom he learns from, it’s all a path. Now that the old sword god has died, Lin Gu Shan has also passed away, and I’m half-dead. Only Su Lang remains. As long as he reaches that level of swordsmanship, no one can stop him. I’m just afraid that Su Lang sets a bad precedent, leading the young practitioners in the martial world to lose their spirit. They’ll think that as long as their swordsmanship is high, the rules mean nothing, and they can kill whoever they want. It’s like… you, Chen Ping'an, or you, Song Fengshan, being wealthy and powerful. If you wish, you can spend lavishly in the brothels and embrace the most beautiful courtesans. But that doesn’t mean that when you see a respectable woman on the street, you can humiliate her with wealth or bully her with power..."

Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, "I’ve never been to a brothel."

Noticing Liu Qian looking down at her tea, with a smile that seemed to hide laughter, Song Fengshan quickly echoed, "Neither have I! Absolutely not!"

Old as ginger, crafty and unyielding, Song Yu Shao turned to Liu Qian and said with a smile, "If a man truly hasn’t been to a brothel or has no such thoughts, he wouldn’t be so certain. He would just laugh it off as if it were nothing."

Liu Qian nodded gently and said softly, "That seems to be true."

Chen Ping'an and Song Fengshan exchanged glances, but Song Fengshan's eyes were filled with grievance and blame—this was all because of you, Chen Ping'an!

How could you blame me? You, Song Fengshan, have been in the martial world for how many years? I, Chen Ping'an, have only been here for a few years! Chen Ping'an blinked and only managed to say half a sentence, "I really have never been."

Song Fengshan was left speechless.

This guy was quite the rascal!

Liu Qian covered her mouth and laughed.

Song Yu Shao laughed heartily, "Looks like you haven’t wasted your time in the martial world all these years, Guawaar!"

Song Fengshan shook his head and said to his wife, "Let’s get some wine; otherwise, I won’t feel satisfied."

Liu Qian stood up to fetch the wine.

Song Yu Shao grew more boisterous, his voice rising.

Song Fengshan drank sparingly, while Liu Qian only had a symbolic cup. 

The two jars of fine wine brewed and stored for over five years from their estate were consumed by Song Yu Shao and Chen Ping'an.

When he heard that Chen Ping'an planned to leave the day after tomorrow, Song Yu Shao waved his hand, "Get two more jars! As long as this rascal can drink me under the table, forget the day after tomorrow; I’ll let him drink until he rolls out of here!"

Liu Qian immediately got up to fetch more wine.

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, "Then I’ll leave the day after tomorrow. Old Master, I really have matters to attend to. I must catch a continental ferry to Bei Ju Lu Zhou. If I miss it, I’ll have to wait at least a month."

Song Yu Shao glared at him, "Then why don’t you just leave now? A day or two of delay is unacceptable! Is it that my face is too small, or have you, Chen Ping'an, become too big for your britches?"

Chen Ping'an muttered, "It’s said that encouraging drinking at the table is where you see the values of the martial world."

Song Yu Shao slapped the table, "Drink your wine! Enough with the nonsense! I see that girl; unless she’s blind, there’s no way she could like a man who’s so slow to drink! What’s the deal? No chance, huh?"

Upon hearing this, Chen Ping'an felt great. His spirits lifted, and he was filled with confidence, though his words stumbled a bit as he replied, "Drink, drink. Are you afraid of me? You really put me in a bind, Old Master. Back then, just because of your words, I was scared half to death, but thankfully, it didn’t matter in the end… Come on, let’s drink this bowl first. To be honest, Old Master, your drinking skills aren’t what they used to be. How many bowls have we had? Look at your face, it's red as if you’ve applied rouge…"

Song Yu Shao puffed up his cheeks and frowned, "When you’re drinking, keep your hand steady! Hold it properly. If a drop spills, you’ll lose a bit of our camaraderie!"

Song Fengshan and Liu Qian couldn’t help but chuckle. They were still young, and the old veterans had endless tricks up their sleeves when it came to drinking, making it hard to keep guard.

An old man and a young one drank until they were blissfully intoxicated.

Eventually, in the eyes of Song Fengshan and Liu Qian, both men had kicked off their shoes and were sitting cross-legged in their chairs.

Fortunately, Song Fengshan was in charge and refused to serve any more wine, so they didn’t get to the point of drinking until they threw up—at least not to that extent.

Chen Ping'an still resided in the same courtyard he had years ago, close to the water pavilion and waterfall.

He collapsed into bed.

Song Yu Shao was not in much better shape, swaying as he returned to his quarters, and soon, loud snores filled the air.

Chen Ping'an was really drunk; lying in bed with his eyes closed, he barely maintained a shred of clarity.

Old Master Song had an issue with his spirit. 

Otherwise, the first time they met, the Sword Saint of Shushui Kingdom had to consider the future of his junior and agreed to Han Yuanshan, only to be constrained by the circumstances and needed to refuse Su Lang’s duel. But even so, today, seeing Chen Ping'an, he certainly didn’t have that mentality.

He wouldn’t simply resign to age and fate.

Yet Chen Ping'an did not directly bring it up. No matter how much he had drunk, he didn’t mention it.

It wasn’t that they had a good relationship and could speak freely after a few drinks. 

Many seemingly casual remarks from one's closest friends could become lifelong knots in the heart.

As they drank to the end, Song Yu Shao suddenly glanced at the bamboo hat placed on the table and at the long sword Chen Ping'an carried on his back. "That sword you carry, is it good?"

Chen Ping'an nodded. "It’s good."

Song Yu Shao smiled. "That’s good."

Chen Ping'an felt confused, not thinking much of it as he burped.

Song Fengshan and Liu Qian exchanged a fleeting, somber glance, but they quickly masked it well.

Chen Ping'an drank until he had a headache, murmuring to himself as he drifted off to sleep.

Today there is wine, today we drink; if I get drunk, I am a deity. Tomorrow's worries belong to tomorrow; with all kinds of troubles, there’s always wine.

Early the next morning, Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, and after washing up, he followed the serene path to the waterfall.

Of course, he wasn't going to practice punches; he wanted to see the words he had secretly carved into the stone wall back then.

As it turned out, he encountered Song Fengshan at the water pavilion, not Song Yu Shao.

Chen Ping'an walked over quickly, and Song Fengshan rose to greet him.

Song Fengshan smiled, "Grandfather rarely drinks without restraint and hasn’t gotten up yet."

Chen Ping'an felt a bit guilty. After a moment of silence, he looked around. "Aren’t you going to miss it after moving away from here?"

Song Fengshan replied, "Of course, I’ll feel a bit reluctant. But this was grandfather's decision, actively seeking out Han Yuanshan. Actually, Liu Qian and I didn’t want to agree at first. Our initial thought was to take a step back and see if that Wang Yiran, whom grandfather also approved of, could win a match in the sword and knife duel, allowing him to become the martial alliance leader of Shushui Kingdom. Sword Water Mountain Villa definitely wouldn’t relocate; after all, the estate is grandfather's lifelong work. But Grandfather wouldn’t agree, saying the estate is dead, and people are alive. What’s there to be attached to? You know grandfather's temper; he can’t be persuaded."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Old Master is like that. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone alone to intercept the thousand soldiers of the Shushui Kingdom."

Song Yu Shao held great importance in Chen Ping'an's eyes.

For some people, as long as they remained in the martial world, everything they did felt like pouring a cup of wine from the wine gourd of the martial world, filled with chivalry, allowing others to take the cup and drink freely.

Song Fengshan smiled. "Grandfather has no attachment to the current martial world; he often says it’s hard to find a friend to drink with these days, which is why he acts this way."

It seemed a bit heavy, but then Song Fengshan quickly joked, "Chen Ping'an, don’t let the fact that grandfather made you drink so much make you afraid to come to our new estate for drinks in the future. To be honest, it’s also your fault; you said you were leaving soon. Our grandfather wouldn’t really delay your matters, but at the table, the older generation is like this. They won’t say soft words in front of younger generations, so they can only pull you to drink a bit more."

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, "I understand that."

Song Fengshan continued, "To be honest, Wei Wei suddenly flew her sword to the mountain villa and asked Liu Qian whether you were currently in the estate. It seems that if she gets a truthful answer, she’ll come over. I told Liu Qian to pretend she didn’t receive the sword and to wait until you leave before replying that she had indeed come, but just to drink with grandfather."

Chen Ping'an cupped his hands in gratitude.

After drinking too much last night, he had roughly mentioned reuniting with Wei Wei, one of the Four Evils of the Shushui Kingdom, but he didn’t mention the matter with the mountain god. 

That was a mess for Chen Ping'an to sort out himself. 

For example, at the Xianjia ferry of Di Long Mountain, he would need to find an opportunity to send a sword message to Wei Bo at Piyun Mountain, inquiring about the situation, and the usual reactions from the officials of the Great Li Kingdom and the local court.

Wei Bo was the righteous deity of the Great Li Kingdom's northern peak, far from the Shushui Kingdom located in the central part of the Baoping Continent. That’s precisely why Chen Ping'an acted so directly; otherwise, he would have indeed held back and taken a more subtle approach.

Song Fengshan pointed in the direction of the town. "Su Lang has already left with that sword-attendant girl. I believe soon there will be a shocking rumor spreading through the martial world of over a dozen kingdoms, that Su Lang fought a true sword immortal and, although defeated, maintained his honor."

Chen Ping'an didn’t care about the rumors and smiled, "I’ve never quite understood why there are sword attendants."

This had been the case with the princess in the palace and also with Su Lang.

Song Fengshan appeared slightly awkward.

Chen Ping'an inquired, "Does Brother Song share this sentiment too?"

Song Fengshan quietly replied, "I only dare to think about it in my heart."

Chen Ping'an rubbed his chin, and what was initially incomprehensible to him suddenly made sense as he considered Song Fengshan’s feelings. 

In any case, Chen Ping'an would never think about it. 

He furrowed his brows suddenly; this Su Lang was indeed a persistent nuisance. 

At that moment, the elderly steward named Chu quickly approached, standing outside the pavilion with a wry smile. "The Qingzhu Sword Immortal Su Lang has come secretly, waiting outside the gate, asking to see Young Master Chen. He says he has the gall to trouble you with something, and in the future, there will be ample rewards."

Song Fengshan thought for a moment and understood the situation, sneering, "He’s already made two advances."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, waving his hand, "It’s fine; just him coming to the door means he drank so much of the good wine from the estate."

Song Fengshan shook his head, "That’s two different matters!"

Chen Ping'an joked, "Brother Song, you really can’t stop me."

Song Fengshan smiled, "Not even ten of me could stop you, but you’ve called me Brother Song…"

Before Song Fengshan could finish, Chen Ping'an had already pressed his fingers together and lightly drew his sword from the sheath, "Remember not to injure anyone; make sure it’s loud enough."

The sword immortal was unleashed. 

He dashed out of the water pavilion, shooting straight into the clouds, leaving a golden line hanging in the air. 

With the sword energy unleashed, thunder rumbled, scattering the clouds above Sword Water Mountain Villa. 

Occasionally, the golden line would swiftly approach the mountain’s master but would quickly ascend again.

Moments later, Chen Ping'an looked up and smiled, "I’m back."

That long sword, like a dragon dancing through the clouds, seemed to obey the command of a celestial being, rapidly descending and returning to its sheath. 

Song Fengshan stood there, speechless. 

He knew that Chen Ping'an’s martial arts had to be quite formidable; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to drive Su Lang back. But he never expected it to be this terrifying.

Chen Ping'an flipped his wrist and offered a jar of Wu Ti wine, suppressing a laugh. "Having drunk the good wine from the estate, you should also try mine. I’m not Old Master; my wine truly can counteract the spice."

Song Fengshan unsealed the clay cover, sniffed it, "Authentic celestial brew; now this is good wine."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "This kind of wine is just good to drink. I never fret over it—if there’s wine, I drink; if there’s none, I don’t think about it. But I’ve been thinking about the wine from your Sword Water Mountain Villa for many years."

Song Fengshan raised the wine jar, while Chen Ping'an picked up his sword-raising gourd. They both said in unison, "Let’s drink!"

Song Fengshan finished half a jar of wine and then stopped. Chen Ping'an stood up, saying he wanted to check out the waterfall. 

Song Fengshan did not accompany him.

As they left the water pavilion, Song Fengshan turned back, now holding a jar of Wu Ti wine said to be from Shujian Lake, and handed it to the old steward, saying it was a gift from Chen Ping'an. He also wanted to discuss more later, urging him not to keep it. The old steward, who had a good relationship with Chen Ping'an from back in the day, smiled widely as he accepted the wine jar. As long as it was wine from that young man, he’d take it, regardless of quality. The old steward mentioned that the Qingzhu Sword Immortal had already left, and before departing, Su Lang paid his respects at the gate of the villa in a grand gesture with his sword.

Liu Qian met with Song Fengshan and the old steward halfway, calling out to him, "Chu Grandpa," as the old man smiled and departed.

The couple had only taken a short stroll when Song Yu Shao approached them.

Seeing his grandfather, Song Fengshan smiled, "Grandfather, don’t worry; I won’t say too much."

Only then did Song Yu Shao pat his grandson's shoulder and continue walking toward the water pavilion, where he sat down, reminiscing about the past. For older men, it’s easy to do so, waking up early and staying up late. Young people often don’t understand that an elder’s thoughts are filled with memories of old friends and stories. Young people typically don’t enjoy listening, so the elderly can only think and reminisce alone.

At the water pavilion, Chen Ping'an punched the waterfall, breaking it, and saw those words, smiling knowingly.

Turning around, he quickly left the waterfall area and came outside the pavilion.

Song Yu Shao had already walked out of the pavilion. "Let’s go eat hotpot."

Chen Ping'an was a bit shocked. "Isn’t it too early for that? The tavern hasn’t even opened yet."

Song Yu Shao laughed, "The title of Sword Saint of Shushui Kingdom is still worth something; it’s fine to eat hotpot at home. Besides, it’s you treating us, so there’s no issue regarding money. If the tavern keeper curses afterward, it’s also directed at you."

The two didn’t rush off like birds taking flight, but instead strolled leisurely, as suggested by Song Yu Shao.

Halfway there, the old steward chased after them, carrying the bamboo hat Chen Ping'an had left indoors.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Are you rushing me out?"

Song Yu Shao laughed, "The sooner you leave, the sooner you can come back next time. Can’t you understand this simple reasoning? Don’t be so stubborn!"

Chen Ping'an had no retort.

When they arrived at the town, there was no smoke rising from kitchens, only the occasional crowing of chickens or barking of dogs, making it even quieter.

Song Yu Shao knocked vigorously on the tavern door; the familiar old tavern keeper Chen Ping'an knew was gone, replaced by a drowsy middle-aged man. But upon seeing the Sword Saint, the man smiled, "What's this, Old Master?"

Song Yu Shao pointed to the young man in the green robe wearing a bamboo hat beside him. "This guy wants hotpot; please set up a table for him."

The man’s face and heart had no complaint; the friendship between the tavern and the villa had been passed down from his father. Even though his father had passed away and the villa was rumored to be moving, he still cherished the old villa and the old master. He smiled and said, "Alright, I’ll prepare for you, Old Master. As it happens, the second floor is quiet right now; there are no other guests."

Song Yu Shao led Chen Ping'an to a window-side spot on the second floor.

The tavern was familiar with the Sword Saint's tastes, be it the soup base or the meats and vegetables, they chose the best. 

Soon, the table was filled with all sorts of dishes, and the hotpot began steaming.

Song Yu Shao ordered two jars of wine, one for each of them, and said to Chen Ping'an, "Let’s just have a light meal today. Drink less and eat more."

Chen Ping'an nodded. Song Yu Shao glanced at the sauce bowl Chen Ping'an had prepared across the table, noting how vibrant red it was, with half a bowl of chopped chili. "Not bad; this rascal knows how to do it."

Chen Ping'an was more talkative today than yesterday, chatting more about the matters on the mountain. 

Among them was the journey to the Misty Mountain in Caiyi Kingdom. 

Today, Song Yu Shao had been quite restrained with his drinking, taking small sips. After hearing Chen Ping'an's account of breaking the mountain water formation and dismantling the ancestral hall, he nodded with a smile. "In this way, the ancestral hall will truly lose its incense, and the father and son will turn from allies into enemies. Even if they don’t turn against each other immediately, they might eventually share their grievances, putting on smiles while pretending to be close. But Lu Yundai and Lu Tingjiao will know the truth; they can no longer be of one heart. This hand of yours is more effective than truly dismantling their ancestral hall. You, rascal, can do this without killing anyone—who did you learn it from?"

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine. "I learned some things from the mountain and some from the martial world."

Chen Ping'an also talked about the fisherman Wu Shouwen, the young Zhao Shuxia, and the girl Zhao Luan, laughing that he had mentioned Sword Water Mountain Villa to them. Perhaps they would visit the villa in the future, and he hoped the villa wouldn’t lose face, ensuring that the three of them would be well treated, lest they think he was boasting about being friends with the Sword Saint of Shushui Kingdom when he was merely an acquaintance.

Song Yu Shao laughed heartily, helping to cook some beef tripe and placing it in Chen Ping'an's bowl.

The hotpot spread was finished, and one jar of wine was downed. 

Once more, Song Yu Shao escorted Chen Ping'an to the edge of the town, but this time, Chen Ping'an could drink more and handle spicy food, no longer the same embarrassment as before, which left the old man somewhat disappointed.

Chen Ping'an stood still, donning his bamboo hat, and cupped his hands. "Old Master, I’m leaving."

Song Yu Shao nodded, adding one last remark, "Not that handsome, and what’s the point of that bamboo hat?"

Chen Ping'an adjusted his hat, seriously stating, "That’s hard to say; a man’s appearance is determined by a woman’s opinion."

Song Yu Shao laughed and scolded, "What does that even count for—a mere straw!"

Chen Ping'an chuckled and turned to leave.

Song Yu Shao watched until Chen Ping'an had walked quite a distance before he turned around, following the lonely street back to the villa.

The old man walked past the archway where Su Lang had swept by, intending to challenge him.

There were some questions Chen Ping'an wanted to ask but felt it inappropriate to do so. The young man had been sidestepping around the dinner table, speaking of things that seemed unrelated, such as his exploits in the Misty Mountain.

Song Yu Shao, though not highly skilled in swordsmanship, had not wasted his years in the martial world. Would he not understand Chen Ping'an’s nature? Would he not know that these words, which hinted at boasting, were far from what Chen Ping'an would normally say? 

Why? It was simply to ease the old man's heart, to tell him that if there were truly matters at hand, if Chen Ping'an genuinely asked, he could simply say it out loud and not keep it bottled up.

But throughout it all, Song Yu Shao had clearly communicated with his words and actions that he had no worries, that everything was fine, and it was Chen Ping'an who was overthinking.

With his hands behind his back, Song Yu Shao looked up at the sky. 

The sun was high, clear, and cloudless; it was a beautiful day.

He hoped that the young man would have such a smooth journey in the martial world from now on.

At noon that day, it had been the third day since Chen Ping'an left the villa.

A flustered girl with apricot eyes, wearing embroidered shoes, rushed into Sword Water Mountain Villa.

Upon seeing Liu Qian and Song Fengshan, she lamented that Chen Ping'an had left, immediately expressing her grievances, saying that the couple was inconsiderate for not helping to retain him for a few more days.

Liu Qian felt a bit strange and asked if something had happened on the mountain that needed Chen Ping'an's help.

Then Liu Qian spoke sternly, "As for the grudge between you and the mountain god, as long as you, Wei Wei, speak up, our Sword Water Mountain Villa can lend a hand, but the villa will absolutely not let Chen Ping'an intervene."

Wei Wei's expression was odd. "Didn’t this great sword immortal mention anything about the incident at the ancient temple?"

Liu Qian was puzzled. "He did mention it. You still dare to go back to that old business? After suffering under our grandfather, you still haven’t learned your lesson and are trying to deceive men’s vitality at the ancient temple again. So, did you meet him, and is there any hidden story?"

Wei Wei chuckled awkwardly, "No hidden story. It’s just that he took a liking to me but was too shy to say it. I’m actually a bit tempted, so I thought of asking Old Master Song to help me play matchmaker…"

Song Fengshan couldn’t help but smirk at the nonsense. Who didn’t know what Wei Wei truly liked? Besides, with Chen Ping'an’s temperament and current prowess, it was already a stroke of luck that he didn’t slay the demon directly back then.

Liu Qian laughed as she directly exposed Wei Wei, "Alright, stop with these life-threatening jokes! If our grandfather or Chen Ping'an hears that, you’ll be in for it!"

Liu Qian cast a sidelong glance at the couple, who seemed relaxed, frowning as she asked, "Su Lang wouldn’t have accidentally died on the way, would he? If he doesn’t come looking for trouble with you, shouldn’t you be crying every day? You, Liu Qian, wiping Song Fengshan's tears while he tells you not to cry?"

Song Fengshan couldn’t stand the teasing from the Shushui Kingdom ghost girl and made an excuse to leave.

Liu Qian then told Wei Wei about Su Lang being driven back and the subsequent request for another audience, explaining the situation somewhat.

In fact, over the years, Liu Qian had been diligently managing the affairs of Sword Water Mountain Villa, so she knew what should and shouldn’t be said.

Otherwise, the grandfather and grandson wouldn’t have been so reassured about her managing the household.

Wei Wei exclaimed, "Oh! So Chen Ping'an's swordsmanship has reached such a divine level? I’m truly astonished! I should have self-recommended a place beside him when I met him at the ancient temple! Even if I didn’t like men, I could just close my eyes and go with it."

Liu Qian tossed some sunflower seeds at her. "Enough with the shameless nonsense!"

Wei Wei suddenly said, "I should have arrived yesterday, but alas, us ghostly beings traveling by wind can’t match a sword immortal soaring through the skies. Forget it, no need to mention those things. I, after hundreds of years of hard training, am still not as good as a man who’s been wandering the mountains for less than ten years. It’s heartbreaking. Qian'er, the reason I was late by a day was that I made a trip to the state capital to plan a significant event involving the roots of the Dao. I won’t go into details, but you’ll find out sooner or later. However, during this process, I noticed the shadow of Hengdao Villa. That little woman, Wang Shanhua, is now quite full of herself. Even from several miles away, I can smell the perfume on her."

"It’s likely that after Su Lang suffered a loss, the spies Han Yuanshan left in the town have sent word, which is why Hengdao Villa is making a move right away."

Wei Wei pressed her hand to her heart, feigning a resentful expression. "You all need to prepare early. If my lover, Chen Ping'an, were still at the villa, it wouldn’t matter. But now that this… heartless man has run off, if Han Yuanshan comes after you, I won’t show favoritism. At most, I won’t help either side. Sisterly bonds are one thing, but if Han Yuanshan truly comes for you, I can only silently weep."

In truth, Wei Wei found it curious why Han Yuanshan was so ruthless, disregarding the bigger picture, and insisted on bearing a grudge against Sword Water Mountain Villa, forcing Song Yu Shao to relocate the villa and build a mountain god temple. He was just clinging to a dream, hoping to take that position and become the new mountain god of Sword Water Mountain Villa—the very mountain monster that Chen Ping'an had slain with a single sword strike—was dreaming of an instant elevation.

As for the significant matter she hadn’t mentioned, it was naturally her plotting to replace that mountain god, vying for the position to surpass Liu Qian. Sisters in this world often compare their lives against each other, and Wei Wei and Liu Qian had been among the Four Evils of the Shushui Kingdom. With Liu Qian as the lady of Sword Water Mountain Villa, why couldn’t Wei Wei become a mountain god, and surpass Liu Qian?

Regarding the business deal between Sword Water Mountain Villa and Han Yuanshan, Liu Qian naturally wouldn’t say anything to Wei Wei.

Heartfelt words are best kept to a minimum, and one must choose wisely.

Otherwise, once they are laid bare, they can’t be put back.

After contemplating for a while, Liu Qian carefully considered her words, then slowly said, "It shouldn’t be anything bad. Most likely, Chen Ping'an's actions have made Han Yuanshan wary. Given his cautious nature, he probably won’t show up in person. Instead, he’ll let his puppet Wang Yiran come to the villa to negotiate without letting things escalate too much."

Wei Wei thought for a moment and figured that was likely the case.

Back in the day, there had been an encounter with an elderly man and a younger one facing thousands of troops on the battlefield.

There was a young swordsman in a bamboo hat who, after leaving the town, didn’t head directly to the Xianjia ferry at Di Long Mountain. Instead, he asked a nearby mountain god who was about to be "promoted," after which he finally understood something that neither Song Yu Shao, Song Fengshan, nor Liu Qian wished to voice.

Why had Song Yu Shao lost his spirit as a master of swordsmanship and a pure martial artist?

This was a matter few knew at Sword Water Mountain Villa.

Yet this mountain god, who had been entrusted with high hopes by the Shushui Kingdom’s court, governed the fate of the land and, using his life-binding divine abilities, was able to discern these matters.

Was it a big deal? Not really; no one died.

Was it small? Could it be considered small? 

Not at all.

Once, there had been a martial artist from afar who came to Sword Water Mountain Villa and requested to take a bamboo sword sheath.

Initially, he said he wanted to buy it with a pile of celestial coins.

Song Yu Shao refused.

The reason was simple: the sword sheath was meant as a gift for a friend, not for sale.

Then that martial artist, whose level of cultivation was unimaginable, told Song Yu Shao to think it over for three days; after three days, it wouldn’t be a matter of purchase. 

As he left, the man shot a glance at Song Fengshan and Liu Qian, filled with the disdain of a mountaintop figure looking down on ants, and changed his words, saying that two lives were also worth a purchase.

Song Yu Shao remained silent for three days. 

Song Fengshan and Liu Qian resolved not to persuade their grandfather; if he didn’t want to sell, then he wouldn’t!

But on that last day, Song Yu Shao handed over the bamboo sword sheath without accepting the celestial coins. 

After that, the old man truly aged.

However, he took the initiative to drink with his grandson and granddaughter-in-law, even raising a cup to Liu Qian, saying that his grandson was fortunate to have found such a wife; it was a blessing from their ancestors. In the past, he, as a grandfather, had underestimated her. Liu Qian drank that cup with tears in her eyes. Ultimately, the old man comforted the two younger ones, saying it was nothing, truly nothing. They shouldn’t take it to heart; it was just a bamboo sword sheath. After all, he had never mentioned this to that little rascal Chen Ping'an, and they could just pretend nothing had happened.

At this moment, a grand procession was slowly approaching the young swordsman in the green robe.

Chen Ping'an collected his thoughts. After meeting the local mountain god, he instructed the mountain god not to mention their meeting to the villa.

The mountain god naturally wouldn’t dare, but being able to sit atop the mountain with that young sword immortal and share a drink, the old mountain god of the Shushui Kingdom felt quite honored.

The reason Chen Ping'an didn’t leave immediately, nor did he return to Sword Water Mountain Villa, was that he felt uneasy and didn’t know what to do.

He just kept wandering around, thinking about things. 

And then he encountered an acquaintance again.

(End of this chapter)

 ### Chapter 544: Putting the Sword into the Jar for a Wash

Chen Ping'an merely glanced a few times before stepping aside to let the caravan pass. 

Having traveled the rivers and lakes for many years, he had seen countless peculiarities from the mountain cultivators and the myriad forms of human kingdoms. His sight had sharpened, and what once seemed strange no longer surprised him.

This caravan not only had the official identity of the Shushui Kingdom, with light cavalry guards bearing bows and sabers, but also included composed young warriors from the rivers and lakes, their swords hanging backward. The unique way of wearing swords from the Hengdao Mountain Villa was particularly memorable.

Among them was a burly man with a massive cowhorn bow on his back, whom Chen Ping'an recognized as Ma Lu. Years ago, at the waterfall pavilion of the Jian Shui Villa, this man, a retainer of Wang Shanju, had clashed with him, only to be sternly reprimanded by Wang Yiran. The family teachings and conduct of the Hengdao Mountain Villa were not lacking; Wang Yiran's current prestige was not solely due to his connections with Han Yuanshan.

Knowing about the dealings between the Jian Shui Villa and Han Yuanshan, along with Su Lang's setbacks in sword inquiry, Chen Ping'an realized the bigger picture for the villa was already set. Thus, even though he recognized Ma Lu, he did nothing more than step aside, slowly walking into the distant forest like those wandering heroes who kept their distance from the officials.

The retainer Ma Lu, loyal to his duty, cast a glance at the passerby, scrutinized him for a moment, and then dismissed him from his mind.

Inside a carriage sat three women. The older woman was the original wife of Chu Hao, the former leader of the Shushui Kingdom's martial alliance, a daughter of noble birth who had always viewed the Jian Shui Villa and the Song family as enemies. When Chu Hao led the imperial army to besiege the Song family, it was this Chu lady who had secretly stirred the pot behind the scenes.

The other two women were younger, yet already married, with their hair styled and adorned. One was surnamed Han, with a baby face still holding a hint of youth, Han Yuanxue, the sister of Han Yuanshan. As a member of the Little Chongshan Han clan, she had married a top scholar, an editor at the Hanlin Academy for three years. Though his rank was modest at the sixth grade, he was still among the most esteemed Hanlin officials, and his exquisite poetry had caught the eye of the Daoist emperor, offering him a bright future.

The other young woman, full of vigor, was Wang Yiran's only daughter, Wang Shanju. Compared to the aristocratic Han Yuanxue, Wang Shanju’s husband was even more accomplished, having been a top scorer at eighteen. It was said that if the emperor hadn’t disdained young prodigies, he would have been directly appointed as the top scholar. Now, he was a governor of a county in the Shushui Kingdom, an impressive feat in a court where young talents were often shunned.

The reason these three women were meeting was clear. Chu lady had hurried from the capital to witness firsthand the plummeting reputation of the Jian Shui Villa after Su Lang’s failed sword inquiry. Wang Shanju was already nearby with her husband, while Han Yuanshan’s son-in-law was about to fill a vacancy. There was a possibility he would not remain in the capital’s Six Ministries but would instead take up a position as the chief magistrate in a local county, a demanding job regardless of one’s competence.

During this visit, Han Yuanshan hoped Wang Shanju’s husband would become a superior to her own man, providing some support. Otherwise, if the inspector were to show disdain and the governor were to be difficult, this highly anticipated chief magistrate could find himself in hot water, where former prestige and family background became double-edged swords.

With a worried brow, the Chu lady looked quite pitiful. Despite her age, she was well-preserved and still had a certain charm, rivaling younger women like Wang Shanju and Han Yuanxue.

How could she not feel frustration? What was supposed to be a grand performance had already started, only to see Su Lang, the so-called "Bamboo Sword Immortal," fail miserably, making it easy for that old scoundrel Song Yushao—who had half his body buried in the ground—to gain undeserved fame.

Heartbroken, she couldn’t help but rub her chest, lamenting her unfortunate fate. She had ended up with two heartless men in her life, neither of whom were worth a dime! One, in pursuit of the greater good, had taken her hand and a dowry akin to a small half of the Shushui Kingdom’s martial world, yet he was a coward, unwilling to confront Song Yushao, always making her wait. Just as she thought the situation was stabilized, he inexplicably died.

The opportunistic Han Yuanshan had more audacity than Chu Hao, shamelessly telling her that with her body and heart in his possession, she should give up any thoughts of revenge and that perhaps the two families would still be friendly in the future.

Fortunately, when Su Lang went to inquire about swords, Han Yuanshan did not refuse her leaving the capital to watch the show, but she had to promise not to take advantage of the chaos or act on her own, only allowed to watch from the sidelines. Otherwise, she shouldn’t expect him to remember the years of their intimate relationship.

Was this how a person spoke?

Over the years, Han Yuanshan had leveraged Chu Hao’s status to gain immense power, now standing as the most influential man in the Shushui Kingdom outside the emperor, yet he treated her so harshly.

But in solitude, she sometimes thought—if Han Yuanshan were not so ruthless, he likely wouldn’t have achieved his current lofty position, and she, as Chu lady, wouldn’t be able to enjoy the admiration of those noblewomen in the capital.

She understood this logic.

Noticing Chu lady’s poor mood, Han Yuanxue gently lifted the carriage curtain for some fresh air.

Ever since her brother went missing years ago, the Little Chongshan Han clan had suffered greatly, facing a series of misfortunes. Their patriarch had forbidden anyone from attending any feasts, and the family had been in seclusion for two years. Later, she noticed the men in her family began to be active again in court and on the battlefield, even more so than before. She knew the powerful general Chu Hao seemed to have developed close ties with the Han clan, and she had felt that general’s gaze upon her, which was strangely familial rather than romantic. Moreover, the Chu lady often took her on spring outings, establishing a close relationship.

Upon hearing of Su Lang’s failure, the Chu lady had initially wanted to return to the capital but received secret letters from both her and the governor’s offices, leading to this trip.

The letter Chu lady received from Han Yuanshan was sharp and urgent, instructing her to visit the Jian Shui Villa, or else she could forget about being the “head wife” in the capital. Since she came from the rivers and lakes, she might as well return there.

Chu lady was both shocked and heartbroken, how could she not be filled with sorrow?

Fortunately, Wang Shanju and Han Yuanxue respected her greatly, which somewhat eased her heart.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an stopped. Soon, a large group of martial artists burst forth from the forest, armed with various weapons and moving with agility.

The caravan noticed the commotion in the woods, and the Shushui Kingdom's light cavalry immediately spread out like a net, drawing their bows.

The Hengdao Mountain Villa disciples showed no fear, surrounding the carriage, preparing for confrontation.

Chen Ping'an was unsure of the origins of these “assassins,” roughly gauging the situation. It was hard to say if they were foolishly challenging a stone with an egg, but they were undoubtedly doomed.

Perhaps it was because “Chu Hao,” this general who had lost his way and seized control of the temple halls, had a terrible reputation, seen by the righteous heroes of the rivers and lakes as a traitor to the country, someone everyone wanted to kill. However, killing Chu Hao was akin to climbing the heavens; targeting those close to him had a chance.

Chu Hao's current standing, especially after the Shushui Kingdom became a vassal of the Dali Song family, had led many in the Shushui Kingdom to view him as someone who, for personal gain, aided the Dali in maintaining civil officials while suppressing many promising officials from Shushui Kingdom. In this process, Chu Hao was not shy about balancing public and private interests, which solidified the perception of him as a national traitor, naturally inciting countless grudges. Among the scholars and in the rivers and lakes, it became a common sentiment to purge the treasonous.

Lady Chu raised her hand and yawned, clearly accustomed to these moths flying into the flame.

Han Yuanxue complained, “These martial artists are so annoying; they only know how to vent their anger on women like us. They aren’t heroes.”

Over the years, the Little Chongshan Han clan had faced multiple attacks. Even Wang Shanju’s husband had once suffered a martial assault due to his close ties with Chu Hao and the Dali barbarians. If it weren’t for the protection of the Dali’s martial secretary, Wang Shanju might have become a widow. So, Han Yuanxue was extremely worried at the thought of her own husband leaving the capital, facing the same inexplicable enmity.

Wang Shanju’s eyes sparkled with excitement, itching to join the fray, but instinctively checked her waist, only to find it empty, feeling quite disappointed. After marrying, her father forbade her from practicing martial arts or carrying a sword.

The last time she accompanied her husband to the water god temple in their territory to pray for rain, they had encountered an assassination on their way back. If she had been carrying a sword, she could have prevented the assassin from getting close. Since then, Wang Yiran still forbade her from carrying a weapon, yet he had sent several experts from the villa to protect his daughter and son-in-law closely.

These righteous individuals from the Shushui Kingdom, numbering more than thirty, likely came from different sects, banding together.

Chen Ping'an found himself in a rather awkward position, standing still while pretending to drink from his sword-raising gourd to avoid favoritism in the impending conflict. 

As for obstructing those noble warriors, he had no intention of doing so.

Perhaps due to Chen Ping'an’s inaction, those martial artists didn’t hold him accountable, intentionally or unintentionally altering their path to bypass him.

Suddenly, a middle-aged swordsman who had already passed Chen Ping'an shouted, “The Jian Shui Villa is here to execute the traitors of the Chu faction!”

Chen Ping'an felt a touch of helplessness.

This was clearly an attempt to force the Jian Shui Villa and the old swordsman of the Shushui Kingdom into a corner, compelling them to re-enter the rivers and lakes and clash with the Hengdao Mountain Villa, preventing Chu Hao from unifying the rivers and lakes.

It was both a conspiracy and an overt scheme.

As long as blood was shed today between both parties, the Jian Shui Villa would be in a dire predicament, becoming a target of hostility among the martial artists and the Shushui Kingdom’s court. The rivers and lakes of Shushui Kingdom and the scholars would undoubtedly rally, fervently supporting the Jian Shui Villa and the old Song.

Chen Ping'an put away his sword-raising gourd, leaning slightly back, swiftly sliding away. In an instant, he positioned himself between both factions, subtly blocking the elite cavalry from the caravan while also obstructing the valiant martial artists seeking to sacrifice themselves.

Arrows whistled through the air, shooting towards the leading martial artists.

With a flick of his sleeve, Chen Ping'an sent three arrows plummeting to the ground, embedding themselves firmly.

A young man halted, pointing his sword tip at the young man in the bamboo hat, his eyes bloodshot as he yelled, “You’re a dog of the Chu faction?! Why are you blocking us from avenging the Jian Shui Villa?!”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Go back. If you want to kill next time, don’t wave the banner of the Jian Shui Villa.”

An elder suddenly spoke loudly, “Chu Yueyi, you, as the adopted son of the Chu family steward and an unnamed disciple of the old sword saint Song, why don’t you join us in slaying the enemy? We can understand your aspirations for swordsmanship, but we’re not afraid of death today. We’re not asking you to fight alongside us; just let us pass!”

Chen Ping'an was both amused and exasperated. The old man’s tactics were quite clever; as expected, upon hearing he was the “Chu Yueyi” of the Jian Shui Villa, the cavalry behind him let loose a second volley of arrows aimed directly at him.

Especially Ma Lu, the burly man, who without a word, drew his strikingly noticeable cowhorn bow, riding high on his horse, drawing the bow like a full moon, an iron arrow whistled through the air towards the troublesome figure.

The local mountain god, who had once shared a drink with the “Sword Immortal,” was sweating profusely, regretting having unleashed his divine powers to patrol the mountains and rivers.

That day had been similar; the martial artist from the Central Plains, visiting the Jian Shui Villa, hadn’t paid him any mind during his observations. But when that unfathomably powerful martial artist grasped the bamboo sword sheath, he had suddenly struck down with a fist, shattering the peak of a nearby mountain, nearly breaking the spirit of this mountain god, who held a significant divine status in the Shushui Kingdom.

To this mountain god, the family of General Chu Hao and the martial artists shouting for blood were all recklessly ignorant, unaware of the greater powers they were provoking.

Su Lang was currently the most formidable martial artist among several kingdoms, including Shushui and Caiyi. Did they really think themselves invincible? Did they not understand that the world was vast and there were beings who looked down upon them?

Thus, the outcome at the town’s archway would hinge on a single punch from the Bamboo Sword Immortal. Even if Su Lang rushed to the Jian Shui Villa to remedy the situation, lowering his stance, it was merely a grand gesture to save face. Otherwise, Su Lang’s name would be tarnished for life.

The mountain god determinedly refused to get involved in this murky water.

Han Yuanxue tugged at Wang Shanju's sleeve, whispering, “Sister Shanju, is that a master?”

Wang Shanju nodded, “Perhaps he qualifies to spar with my father.”

She added firmly, “Of course, he wouldn’t force my father to use all his strength, but if a young martial artist can push my father to use seventy to eighty percent of his power, that would be enough to boast about for a lifetime.”

Han Yuanxue took her words seriously, astonished, “But that person looks so young. How did he gain such skills? Did he consume some miraculous herb that enhanced his martial arts, or did he fall off a cliff and acquire a martial arts manual?”

Wang Shanju was left speechless.

True pure martial artists didn’t have such good fortune.

Only those mountain cultivators might encounter such enviable opportunities, which made them so arrogant, looking down upon the rivers and lakes. Even her father, a great hero, had grievances when speaking of those transcendent beings beyond the mundane.

Han Yuanxue’s childish remarks piqued the interest of the Chu lady. This Han girl had no redeeming qualities; her only skill was luck—she had a good birth, a fortunate brother in Han Yuanshan, and then she married a good husband. It truly made one envious, so the Chu lady’s gaze flickered as she glanced at the focused Han Yuanxue, thinking about giving this little girl a bit of hardship, but it had to be done carefully so that Han Yuanshan wouldn’t find out. Otherwise, he would strip her of her status as “the first wife” without hesitation.

The Chu lady yawned repeatedly, eyeing the martial artists, her lips curling into a smile as she murmured, “What foolish fish, so easily hooked, bringing me money. A wife as capable as I am is hard to find, even with a lantern.”

The two factions hadn’t seen the young hero make a move when three arrows landed in his hand.

Ma Lu’s archery was renowned throughout the Shushui Kingdom. It was said that a certain battlefield general from the Dali barbarians once hoped for Wang Yiran to let Ma Lu join the military, but for some reason, Ma Lu remained at the sword villa, turning down a chance at immense wealth.

A light cavalry captain raised his arm high, halting his men from preparing for another volley, deeming it meaningless. Once a pure martial artist reached the level of a master in the rivers and lakes, unless the opposing forces were overwhelming, every engagement would only lead to failure. 

This cavalry captain turned his gaze not to Ma Lu, but to two unassuming older men—courtiers dispatched by the Shushui Kingdom, established according to the military regulations of the Dali iron cavalry, holding genuine official ranks. One accompanied the Chu lady south from the capital, while the other was from the governor’s office; compared to Ma Lu from Hengdao Mountain Villa, these two were truly formidable.

Among them, a short elder, whose body seemed on the verge of falling apart with each ride, suddenly burst forth with a fierce aura, his long sword vibrating like a war drum.

Among the martial artists in confrontation with the caravan, a tall, beautiful woman looked utterly despaired as she trembled and said, “It’s that Sword Immortal from the mountain!”

The unassuming elder lightly squeezed his horse’s belly, not in a hurry to draw his sword, but the sound of steel ringing out was enough to intimidate.

The elder rode slowly forward, fixated on the young man in the bamboo hat, “I know you are not Chu Yueyi of the Jian Shui Villa; get lost, and I’ll spare your life.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Since a god has come down from the mountain, then let’s speak properly.”

The elder laughed heartily, “Eager to reincarnate?”

What could a mere Shushui Kingdom’s rivers and lakes amount to?

If Su Lang from Song Yu Shao of the Central Plains were here, he might respect them a little more, but this young man before him, while strong, was hardly worthy of his attention—he could flick him away with a finger. However, since the other party was ungrateful, he had no choice but to draw his sword. As long as they were not disciples of the Jian Shui Villa, they had no protective talisman; killing them was just killing.

General Chu Hao had privately instructed him—during this southern expedition, he must not clash with Song Yu Shao and the Jian Shui Villa. For everything else, whether martial masters or wandering cultivators picking up the scraps, slaying them would count as military merit.

Chen Ping'an turned to the martial artists, waving his hand, patiently saying, “Why are you still here? You should run! If you’re just going to get your heads chopped off to exchange for money, is that how you wish to be a good soul?”

Those originally prepared to die in the name of righteousness immediately scattered like birds and beasts, retreating back into the forest.

Chen Ping'an watched their retreating figures, feeling a sudden sense of… boredom.

Even if he told the old Song about this, the old sword saint of the Shushui Kingdom would hardly care. Most likely, he would respond as he did at the last banquet, laughingly saying, “There’s no problem that a hotpot can’t solve; if there is, then let’s have another jar of wine.”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the ever-observant accompanying military cultivator.

The latter nodded in acknowledgment, showing no intention of intervening.

Finally, Chen Ping'an did nothing more than borrow a horse from them, a clear message that it was a one-way transaction. One man and one horse left the place.

The elder swordsman who lost his treasured sword didn’t know why he couldn’t bring himself to speak, allowing the young man to take half his life, as if the moment he opened his mouth, that remaining half of his life would vanish too.

The Dragon Gate cultivator remained silent.

On the mountain, those from the Shushui Kingdom’s rivers and lakes ran for their lives.

Some whispered, speculating if that person was a mysterious mountain god with a youthful appearance.

Others sneered, "What god? Even if he is, he’s no different from that old sword immortal who lost his sword, just a case of black eating black. What does it matter if he’s talented? Does that make him a hero?"

Yet one young man felt a spark of admiration and longing. He still disliked the person, but he yearned for that person’s demeanor.

A young woman sighed softly.

Several people climbed high branches to check if enemies were pursuing. One sharp-eyed individual noticed the man in the bamboo hat galloping away, hands tucked into his sleeves, not a trace of smugness, but rather a hint of melancholy.

Someone spat disdainfully, unsure if out of jealousy or anger, cursing loudly. 

But it seemed that the young swordsman sensed this, turning his head, causing the person on the branch to lose their balance and fall to the ground.

Chen Ping'an suddenly turned and said, “Wei Wei, help me pass a message to Elder Song, telling him that the sword sheath taken to the Central Divine Continent will be returned in the same manner discussed at the Jian Shui Villa.”

A faint blue smoke materialized, following one man and one horse; it was Wei Wei, one of the Four Deaths of Shushui Kingdom, floating gracefully on her embroidered shoes.

Chen Ping'an suddenly laughed, “Add that it might take a long time, so I can only trouble Elder Song to wait. Before I go to the Central Divine Continent, I’ll surely visit him for a drink.”

Wei Wei smiled sweetly.

She hovered in the air, no longer following, watching as the lone rider disappeared into the distance.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 545: The Jianghu Still Has Chen Ping'an

The female ghost Wei Wei rode the winds, traveling far and wide, and naturally arrived at Sword Water Villa long before the carriage convoy.

After Wei Wei's comings and goings, returning to the villa as a guest, Song Yushao still did not show herself; it was still Song Fengshan and Liu Qian who received her. Although Song Yushao had spared Wei Wei in the ancient temple all those years ago, it did not mean that the old Sword Saint of Shushui Country held her in high regard. Even Liu Qian, one of the Four Fiends of Shushui Country and the granddaughter-in-law of Song Yushao, had her own emotional baggage from that time. Nonetheless, as a veteran of the Jianghu who adhered to old customs, Song Yushao, now older and reflecting on the state of the world, had returned home, especially after experiencing the incident with the sword sheath. It was then that he fully acknowledged Liu Qian as "this person" and allowed her to manage affairs, even willing to hustle for her future as a deity of mountains and rivers, proactively associating with Han Yuanshan. Otherwise, Song Yushao, having already gained the favor of the academy, should have been certain in breaking through, but it had instead become an illusion.

In truth, Song Yushao was particularly happy about reuniting with Chen Ping'an this time. Not only had he seen with his own eyes that Chen Ping'an had become a sword immortal on the mountain, but also that Chen Ping'an's journey in the Jianghu resembled his own.

On the same path, with few travelers, they met by chance, walking side by side through the wind and rain, and they should have enjoyed fine wine together.

If the first meeting had Song Yushao viewing the young Chen Ping'an, who traveled with a bookcase on his back, as a promising junior, then the second reunion, where he saw the young man in a green shirt with a bamboo hat and a long sword, sharing tea and hot pot, felt more like two kindred spirits appreciating each other. However, this was Song Yushao's personal experience; in reality, Chen Ping'an still treated him with the respect of a junior to a senior, maintaining his demeanor and attitude. Song Yushao didn’t force the issue; after all, who in the Jianghu wouldn’t care about face?

Upon hearing that Song Fengshan and Liu Qian would once again be discussing matters with Wei Wei, Song Yushao went to sit alone at the pavilion by the waterfall.

After years without practicing swordplay, Song Yushao today placed his old companion, the sword named "Yiran," across his lap. He had inadvertently acquired it from the mechanism of the pillar stone at the deep pool before him. The bamboo sheath, too, had come from there. Years ago, Song Yushao had felt a bit puzzled, as if the sword and sheath were mismatched pieces, not a matched set.

Yiran was certainly a coveted weapon that every martial artist dreamed of. Throughout his life, Song Yushao had loved traveling, visiting famous mountains, wielding his sword in the Jianghu, encountering numerous mystical beings and malevolent spirits, and he had achieved great feats in slaying demons with Yiran. The bamboo sheath, made of special material, had been sought after by Song Yushao in various official and private libraries, where he finally discovered a fragment of an ancient text revealing that the sword was forged by a martial god from another continent. It had been lost in Baoping Continent by an immortal who had traveled across realms, and the ancient text described it as "sharpening the light to split the Five Mountains, the sword energy slashing through the great rivers," a testament to its might.

Yet, regarding the origin of the bamboo sheath, Song Yushao had inquired among many immortals on the mountain, but there was still no clear answer. Some speculated it might be the spiritual artifact from the Qing Shen Mountain within the Bamboo Sea Cave, but without engravings, there were no clues to trace. Furthermore, aside from being the sword room for Yiran, the bamboo sheath showed no other extraordinary qualities, leading Song Yushao to previously consider it merely a compromise for Yiran’s owner. Little did he know, it might have been a disservice to the bamboo sheath.

Looking down at the ancient sword Yiran, its brilliance was unmatched; under the sunlight, it sparkled vibrantly. The mist at the pavilion did nothing to obscure the sword's radiance.

Song Yushao extended his hand and gently tapped the blade before looking back at the cascading waterfall, which resembled a celestial being's long white hair flowing down from above, murmuring, "Old partner, we’re all getting old."

In the conference hall, Wei Wei had recounted the details of the battlefield as well as Chen Ping'an's message for her to relay. Song Fengshan's expression turned serious.

Liu Qian, known for her calm demeanor and dual identity, understood the weight of Chen Ping'an's words after hearing them and felt a bit emotional. "Grandpa didn’t misjudge him."

Song Fengshan softly replied, "That’s hard to say."

Liu Qian nodded. After all, she was a death warrior spy sent by the Great Li Kingdom to Shushui Country, and her perspective was far broader than that of ordinary martial arts masters and mountain immortals.

Thus, she understood the power of that pure martial artist better than either Song Fengshan or Song Yushao.

In the Jianghu of Shushui Country and Songxi Country, the Seven Realms martial artists were akin to legendary martial gods. In fact, the Golden Body Realm was merely the first of the three realms of spirit refinement; the realms of Far Travel and Mountain Pinnacle that followed were even more terrifying. As for the subsequent Ten Realms, they were a source of dread even for those at the Mountain Pinnacle level.

That Far Travel martial artist from the Central Divine Continent was indeed formidable. Liu Qian had a rough idea of his strength, stemming from her connections at the Green Wave Pavilion of the Great Li, where she had assisted in gathering information for the villa. It became clear that this martial artist was not only a pure martial artist at the Eighth Realm but also not an ordinary Far Travel type; he was likely among the strongest in the world of Far Travel, akin to a top-tier Go player among nine-dan professionals, capable of being appointed as a national Go advisor. The reason was simple: high-level individuals from the Green Wave Pavilion had visited to consult Liu Qian and the local mountain god about the matter, as it had drawn the attention of the prince Song Changjing of the Great Li monitoring state! Had it not been for that aggressive outsider leaving early with the sword sheath, Song Changjing might have come personally. However, if that had been the case, things would have been simpler; after all, this Great Li military god had already reached the tenth realm, and as long as he was willing to intervene, Liu Qian believed that no matter how powerful the other party's backing was, neither the Great Li nor Song Changjing would feel any trepidation.

This was no longer merely a matter of who had the stronger fist; it was due to the prevailing trends of the world.

The Great Li Dynasty had already claimed half the continent as its territory, and it was only a matter of time before it monopolized the fortunes of an entire continent. This was the greatest confidence and leverage of the Song family in the Great Li.

Perhaps it wouldn’t be difficult to become one of the top five dynasties in the entire Haoran world.

Wei Wei, who thrived on chaos, lounged in her chair, swinging her embroidered shoes, "Is Madam Chu coming to pay a visit? Should we directly kick the door down, or greet her with a smile? Besides that venomous hearted Madam Chu, there’s also Wang Shanshu from Hengdao Mountain Villa and Han Yuanshan’s sister Han Yuanshu. With three women gathered, it will be quite lively."

Liu Qian smiled slightly, "I'll handle the small matters; the big ones will still be decided by Fengshan."

Song Fengshan sighed, "I still have to listen to Grandpa; I’m just not cut out for dealing with these trivial matters."

Wei Wei looked at Liu Qian and grinned, "I heard that Wang Shanshu secretly had a crush on your husband back in the day?"

Song Fengshan remained unmoved. Such topics were best avoided. He was not versed in trivial matters, but that did not mean he was indifferent; he hoped to achieve further progress in swordsmanship, but it didn’t mean that he was completely oblivious to human emotions.

Liu Qian chuckled, "It’s not surprising for a good man to have several women admiring him."

Wei Wei randomly remarked, "That Chen guy really is impressive. Your grandpa’s eyes are sharp; I didn’t notice anything back then. However, he and your grandpa lack decisiveness. Clearly, his swordsmanship is so high, yet he always drags his feet when taking action, even when he has the advantage. Just look at Su Lang; having broken through, he came right to your villa and boldly proclaimed he wanted to duel. Even though he’s an outsider, he’s still friends with you all. Deep down, I think that green bamboo sword immortal is truly carefree; this is how one should conduct themselves in the Jianghu."

Song Fengshan smirked, "And what was the outcome?"

The petite and delicate female ghost Wei Wei lazily leaned back in her chair, "Su Lang just had a bit of bad luck. I can assert, that guy, even if he gets a face full of dust at your villa this time, will undoubtedly be the leader of our Jianghu in these dozen countries for the next few decades, no doubt about it. You, Song Fengshan, are unfortunate; you can only trail behind him, eating his dust. In terms of swordsmanship and fame, you just can’t compare to that domineering and selfish Su Lang."

Song Fengshan merely chuckled in response. Everyone has their own fate; moreover, a swordsman’s ultimate achievement still relies on the sword in their hand. Just like back when Sword Water Villa was at its peak, the world claimed that Song Yushao, the Sword Saint of Shushui Country, had surpassed the aging old sword god of Caiyi Country. The latter retreated and sealed his sword out of fear of Song Yushao’s challenge, afraid that one day Song Yushao would seek a duel, and thus proactively withdrew to show weakness. Yet, in reality, even if the old sword god of Caiyi Country had faced an unfortunate event and met his end in a most disgraceful manner, he still remained the swordsman that Song Yushao respected the most in his life, without exception.

Liu Qian, however, wore an angry expression.

Wei Wei quickly clasped her hands together, feigning pity, and pleaded, "Alright, alright, it was my long hair that made me short-sighted and spoke without thinking. Sister Liu Qian, you are magnanimous; please don’t be angry."

Song Fengshan, unwilling to linger on the topic with this female ghost, excused himself to head towards the waterfall to relay Chen Ping'an's words to his grandpa.

The female ghost Wei Wei, though she had claimed dominion over the mountain, couldn't be considered wholly malevolent; however, Song Fengshan truly disliked her. Yet, since his wife had good relations with her, along with a layer of alliance, he could sit down and drink tea. For example, the romantic entanglement between Wei Wei and Han Yuanshan was something Song Fengshan detested, and he had privately advised Liu Qian that while alliances were fine for business, their personal friendship should remain discreet. This was one of the few instances where Song Fengshan had to "lecture" his wife on the responsibilities of being the head of the family. Due to trivial matters, Song Fengshan spoke little of reason, which made those reasons appear significant.

Fortunately, Liu Qian listened and acted accordingly.

Thus, Liu Qian’s statement about letting her husband decide the big matters was not a hollow one. This was also Liu Qian's wisdom, and of course, the Song family's long-standing teachings. Otherwise, Liu Qian would have only had an empty title as the young mistress of Sword Water Villa, never gaining true recognition from Song Yushao. In that case, the most difficult position would have actually been Song Fengshan. If Song Fengshan truly let her handle everything, he would only end up regretting it; he wouldn't be able to blame grandpa Song Yushao for being unkind, nor could he blame Liu Qian. The so-called "a good official finds it hard to settle family affairs" ultimately wasn't about reasoning being difficult, but rather how to reason, especially within a family, where the one who speaks lower may truly find it challenging.

As Song Fengshan passed by the Mountain Water Pavilion, the grand convoy had already passed through the small town, arriving outside the villa.

Liu Qian hesitated momentarily but still didn't send anyone to notify Song Yushao and Song Fengshan, the grandfather and grandson. 

On one hand, the visitors were all women: Madam Chu, Wang Shanshu, and Han Yuanshu, and it would be excessive for Song Yushao to personally greet them. Liu Qian couldn't request that; it was just right for Song Fengshan to welcome them together. However, Liu Qian was reluctant to disturb the two of them. On the other hand, the timing of their visit was too coincidental, arriving just after Su Lang had left; their intentions were clear. Although it seemed that Sword Water Villa was in a low point, it was merely an illusion. There was no need to deliberately curry favor with anyone, even if the great general "Chu Hao" were to come in person. After all, she, Liu Qian, as the head of Shushui Country and a spy from the Great Li Green Wave Pavilion, had enough weight and courtesy.

Wei Wei found a place to hide and wandered casually around the villa.

Eventually, she settled in the pavilion near the waterfall, feeling a sense of wonder as she contemplated, how had that unremarkable mud-legged boy suddenly risen to prominence? The key was how he transformed from a low-level pure martial artist into the legendary sword immortal of the mountains? Had he taken some miraculous medicine? If there were truly such a miraculous elixir, she would take a handful and not regret it, even if it killed her.

Meanwhile, at the waterfall pavilion, Song Yushao had returned the ancient sword Yiran to the stone pillar of the deep pool and closed the ancient mechanism built by predecessors, standing on that small "central pillar," hands clasped behind his back, gazing up at the waterfall cascading down, allowing the mist to soak his clothes. When Song Fengshan approached the pavilion, the old man in black finally came to his senses, rushing back inside the pavilion and smiling, "Is there something you need?"

Song Fengshan then recounted the words that Wei Wei had brought.

Song Yushao's expression remained serene.

Song Fengshan questioned, "Grandpa seems completely unfazed by this?"

Song Yushao smiled, feeling quite pleased, "When that rascal pouts, I know what kind of 'mess' he will bring. What’s there to be surprised about? If he didn’t do or say such things, I would find it strange."

Now that Song Fengshan had a good relationship with Song Yushao, he felt no restraints and couldn’t help but tease, "Grandpa, you’ve made a young sword immortal your friend. Just look at how proud you are."

Song Yushao smiled, "Not convinced? Then why don’t you go find a random one on the mountain to show me? If they have even half the skill and character of Chen Ping'an, consider me defeated."

Song Fengshan felt a bit wronged, "Grandpa, who really is your own grandson?"

Song Yushao chuckled, "Of course, it’s the one who hasn’t accomplished much; he’s my true grandson."

Song Fengshan was left speechless.

Song Yushao laughed heartily, patting Song Fengshan's shoulder, "No matter how little skill he has, he is still my grandson. Besides, his character is not worse than that rascal’s."

After pausing for a moment, Song Yushao lowered his voice, "There are some things that I, as a senior, cannot say. You should convey the kind words to Liu Qian; Sword Water Villa owes her a lot. You are her man; focusing on sword practice is good, but that’s no reason to disregard the efforts of those around you. Once a woman marries, she bears burdens in every matter, and it’s never a given."

Just as Song Fengshan was about to speak, Song Yushao's glare silenced him, "Does my reasoning fall short? Just listen, and look at how Chen Ping'an is, eager to remember my words; learn from him!"

Song Fengshan laughed, "I wouldn’t dare argue back with you, so I’ll just place the blame on Chen Ping'an. Next time he comes, with his drinking capacity, one Song Fengshan can easily take down two Chen Ping'ans."

Song Yushao nodded, "I won’t stop you from that."

Suddenly, Song Yushao remarked, "You should prepare to meet Han Yuanshan; I won’t bother with him; there’s nothing to discuss."

Song Fengshan asked, "Is he hiding in the convoy?"

Song Yushao nodded, "If you don’t believe me, we can place a bet."

Song Fengshan shook his head, "That’s a sure loss; what should we gamble on? I’m going to Liu Qian now."

Song Yushao escorted Song Fengshan to the Mountain Water Pavilion, where the female ghost Wei Wei was still swinging her legs.

Song Fengshan quickly left.

Song Yushao stepped into the pavilion.

Wei Wei turned her head, looking pitiful, "Old Sword Saint, please don’t pull out an old almanac from your sleeve."

Song Yushao chuckled, "It’s been many years since I’ve roamed the Jianghu; an old almanac really is just that—old."

Wei Wei sighed, "When you roamed the Jianghu, we wretches all wished for you to die early, so we wouldn’t have to worry every day about you resurrecting the almanac and saying today is a good day to offer a sword. Now that I look back, without you, it’s not entirely a good thing. If that mountain monster hadn’t come, how could they dare act so recklessly, harming others everywhere, and almost abducting me to become a bandit’s wife?"

Song Yushao was blunt and unrelenting, "You scoundrels and wicked ghosts only learn a little from being with others."

Wei Wei giggled, her laughter flourishing.

Song Yushao glanced at her, "You’re making a scene, ruining the villa’s feng shui—looking for trouble?"

Wei Wei quickly composed herself, softly asking, "Old Senior, could I ask you something?"

Song Yushao sneered, "Old Senior? How old are you? Don’t you know yourself?"

Dealing with such a stiff old man, Wei Wei was truly vexed. However, given the peculiar situation in Shushui Country and the oddities surrounding Sword Water Villa, Liu Qian was an ungrateful woman, showing no concern for her, always thinking about this dilapidated villa that would soon become a mountain god temple. As for Song Fengshan, Wei Wei dared not provoke him; if she accidentally incurred Liu Qian's ire, it would be a loss. Thus, she could only come to seek favor with Song Yushao.

Wei Wei mustered her courage to ask, "Can Han Yuanshan really use the guise of Chu Hao to monopolize the power in Shushui Country?"

Song Yushao clicked his tongue, "Aren’t you his mistress? Why not ask him instead of coming to me? No wonder you, Wei Wei, are still inferior to a mountain monster porcupine."

Wei Wei forced a smile, "What kind of person is Han Yuanshan? You, Old Senior, aren’t unaware that he loves to turn against people. Even if business is going well, you never know when he’ll sell you out completely. There have been plenty who fell into his trap in previous years. I’m truly frightened. Even when leaving the mountain this time to scheme for a small mountain god of my own, I don’t dare mention it to Han Yuanshan. I can only obediently follow the rules, pay the money required, and deliver the women as necessary. I’m worried that even though I have borrowed the wind of that scholar from the academy, it will turn out that I cleared my relationship with Han Yuanshan. If I’m not careful and proactively go to him, reminding him that I exist, he might drain my resources. Once the new mountain god rises to power, I’ll be the one he uses to establish his authority. After all, killing me, one of the Four Fiends of Shushui Country, would surely please the masses."

Song Yushao said, "You’re not foolish."

Wei Wei sighed, "I was foolish back then, which is why I died. I can’t afford to be so foolish now that I’m a ghost."

Song Yushao seemed to have been prepared, "Regarding your plans to acquire the identity of a mountain god, I can let Fengshan and Liu Qian assist you. In exchange, aside from the payment you owe for the divine money, you also need to help us keep an eye on the local mountain god. We can’t trust him. If he were to damage this feng shui treasure, even if we move away, we would still be implicated."

Wei Wei tentatively asked, "If I don’t seek your help, will your villa still actively assist me?"

Song Yushao sneered, "Then just pretend I never said anything and wait to see."

Wei Wei’s expression turned awkward as she gently slapped her own face, "Look at my big mouth. Old Senior, you are a great hero. Your words carry weight! Otherwise, how could Chen Ping'an respect you so much? You don’t know this, but in my mountain’s ancient temple, just by presenting a sword, he shattered the mountain god's golden body, which was a court-appointed mountain spirit. It truly was a pitiful end, vanishing without a trace. A remarkable young sword immortal like that still treats you with respect; it just goes to show how powerful you are, Old Senior."

Song Yushao stroked his beard and laughed, "Though those are all empty flattery, the sentiment is genuine."

Wei Wei smiled sweetly.

Unexpectedly, Song Yushao added, "Too much of anything is no good, or else it just becomes nauseating."

Wei Wei pouted in frustration.

After a moment of silence, Wei Wei asked, "Old Senior, aren’t you going to check out the situation over there?"

Song Yushao said something peculiar, "Tea has no flavor."

Wei Wei quickly responded, "Well, then I’ll come back to accompany you for a drink later?"

In response, Song Yushao simply said, "Get lost."

Wei Wei felt embarrassed but her frustration was of no use.

### In the Conference Hall

There really wasn’t much of an edge to the discussion.

Because Madam Chu, the wife of the great general, as well as Wang Shanshu and Han Yuanshu, could hardly engage in conversation.

Upon entering the villa, an elderly coachman with cloudy eyes and a slight hunch suddenly straightened up, revealing himself to be Chu Hao.

This surprised many.

Madam Chu, whether or not she was of the same mind as her husband, being beside Han Yuanshan, still couldn’t recognize "Chu Hao," needless to say the others.

Clearly, Han Yuanshan was far more serious when facing Liu Qian than he was with a sword-obsessed Song Fengshan.

Madam Chu was filled with resentment; when Han Yuanshan had placed a legendary Dragon Gate immortal by her side, she had thought that he, the unfaithful man, had shown an unusual depth of feeling. She never realized that in the end, it had all been for his own safety; she had been deluding herself.

Han Yuanshu, with her youthful face, still found it awkward every time she saw the great general "Chu Hao."

As for Wang Shanshu, comparatively, her thoughts were the simplest; she just wanted to come and take a look at Song Fengshan, wanting to see this once-admired Jianghu hero and swordsmanship prodigy, knowing she was now living well, married to a man far superior to any Jianghu figure—a district magistrate and a future key minister of Shushui Country. How could Song Fengshan, who was soon to be ousted from his ancestral home and face a wandering Jianghu life, compare?

Unfortunately, when Song Fengshan saw her, he remained polite, nothing more.

This made Wang Shanshu feel somewhat defeated.

Liu Qian was fully aware of their feelings but never thought too much about it; she merely thought Wang Shanshu didn’t understand her husband. Even without her, Liu Qian knew Fengshan wouldn’t like Wang Shanshu; she was too delicate. A woman could be proud, but constantly competing and being stubborn like a little hedgehog was not appealing. Perhaps there were men in the world who liked such qualities, but Song Fengshan was not one of them.

The conference hall was devoid of outsiders.

Even the two old mountain immortals were not called for, remaining in their respective residences to cultivate in seclusion. For cultivators, even if they ventured into the mundane world, they needed to maintain their peace of mind; otherwise, it wouldn’t be about tempering their inner selves but rather eroding their cultivation and neglecting their path.

Liu Qian had discussed some matters with the three women that were appropriate for their presence, then took the initiative to lead them away, leaving only Song Fengshan and the most powerful official of the Shushui Country.

As the four women strolled through the villa, this was Han Yuanshu's second visit, and she still found it fresh and new. Her lively nature prompted her to speak freely, lamenting how it would be a shame to move away from such a place. Liu Qian engaged this naïve lady of noble birth in conversation and laughter. Madam Chu, on the enemy's turf of Sword Water Villa, felt entirely out of place. However, her husband did not support her; now that Sword Water Villa had turned misfortune into fortune, thanks to an outsider's intervention, they managed to block Su Lang from challenging them and made sure the entire Jianghu of Shushui Country knew Sword Water Villa had such a mountain friend. In the future, it would be even harder for her to create trouble for Sword Water Villa and Song Yushao.

Wang Shanshu felt somewhat distracted.

Though she had married an elegant scholar with a promising future and their relationship was harmonious, for a woman who had grown up in the Jianghu, a sense of regret still lingered in her heart. Deep down, whenever she was alone at night or heard about recent Jianghu disputes from her family's knife shop confidants, she felt ripples of emotion.

When Han Yuanshu mentioned the assassination they encountered on the road and the sudden emergence of the young swordsman in green, both Madam Chu and Wang Shanshu perked up.

Liu Qian didn’t hide anything, smiling, "That person is our grandfather's friend."

Liu Qian suddenly left them hanging, saying halfway, "Actually, both Shanshu and Yuanshu know him."

Han Yuanshu's eyes widened as she pointed at herself, "I know such a celestial being? How come I didn’t know?"

Wang Shanshu felt suspicious but didn’t dare ask anything, as if to do so would diminish Liu Qian in some way.

However, Madam Chu, with her quick thinking, asked with a smile, "Could it be that boy who fought alongside Old Sword Saint Song back in the day?"

Liu Qian nodded, "That’s him."

Wang Shanshu frowned, her face paling.

Han Yuanshu paused for a moment, inadvertently touching on a sore spot, "Isn’t this the same poor boy who once sparred with Sister Shanshu?"

Liu Qian felt helpless. How naive was this girl? She was indeed fortunate; otherwise, without her family, how would she survive?

Liu Qian didn’t want to worsen Wang Shanshu's feelings, so she smiled, "Indeed, when he visited the villa this time, after defeating Su Lang, while drinking with our grandfather, he mentioned the techniques of Wang Villa’s swordsmanship, which he remembered vividly. It’s something that neither the mountain nor the rivers have ever seen. When my grandfather spoke of your sword techniques being truly transcendent, he fully agreed."

Although Wang Shanshu knew it was just flattery, it still made her feel somewhat better. After all, her father, Wang Yiran, had always been a towering figure in her eyes.

Yet Han Yuanshu added salt to her wounds, naively asking, "Sister Shanshu, didn’t you say that young sword immortal wasn’t a match for Wang Villa’s master? But if he could defeat the green bamboo sword immortal, then Wang Villa’s master might not stand a chance."

Wang Shanshu turned a deaf ear, remaining silent.

Alongside her anger at Han Yuanshu's thoughtlessness, there was also resentment towards that former rival.

She felt a pang of anxiety and fear. That boy, once so dirty and poor, had now become the most fulfilled sword immortal of the mountains. What was she to do?

She couldn’t bear to believe, or dare to believe, yet she knew that was the truth and reality.

Would her father’s hard-earned Hengdao Mountain Villa suffer because of her past impulsiveness? She had heard tales of how mountain cultivators operated—revenge is a dish best served cold, and it’s never too late. There’s never a mediator with enough reputation to sit down, toast, and laugh off past grievances.

Liu Qian spoke gently, "Shanshu, don’t worry. That person is my grandfather’s friend, and he doesn’t resemble the kind of cultivator from legends; rather, he seems more like a Jianghu person."

Wang Shanshu forced a smile, nodding her head, as a way to thank Liu Qian. However, her expression grew increasingly bleak.

At the boundary where Shushui Country met Songxi Country, on the Dragon Mountain at the immortal crossing.

There was a swordsman in a green shirt under a bamboo hat leading a horse along.

As he traveled, two matters were causing a stir, spreading throughout Shushui Country. Storytellers skilled in business had begun to sensationalize the events.

The green bamboo sword immortal from Songxi Country, Su Lang, challenged Song Yushao to a duel outside the villa in a small town, where he encountered a top-tier immortal from the mountains. The two engaging in two breathtaking battles, especially the second encounter. It was said that on that day, the sword energy from Sword Water Villa soared to the heavens, covering the skies, a scene rarely seen in the Jianghu for a century. Even if the old sword god from Caiyi Country had reincarnated to take Su Lang’s place, he may not have achieved such grandeur, let alone the old sword saint Song Yushao who simply stood by and watched. No one doubted that in the coming decades, Su Lang would be the foremost martial artist in the Jianghu of these dozen countries.

Additionally, the chivalrous heroes led by the warrior Xiao engaged in a bloody battle against a group of rebellious traitors, suffering heavy casualties, showcasing the heroic spirit of Shushui Country. Although their celestial aura may not have matched Su Lang's, in terms of chivalry, they were not far behind.

Chen Ping'an was not concerned with these matters; he only made a special trip to Qingfu Pavilion, where he had parted ways with Xu Yuanxia and Zhang Shanfen after visiting this celestial shop.

Tethering his horse outside the five-story tall Qingfu Pavilion, the couplets remained as he had seen them years ago: "Honest dealings, our prices are fair; treat others as you wish to be treated, esteemed guests, return again."

Chen Ping'an entered, and soon a young woman came to greet him, her words no different from before. Heavy objects were appraised and sold on the first floor, spiritual tools on the second, and magical treasures on the third.

Chen Ping'an inquired if a certain elder was still in charge on the second floor. The woman confirmed that he was, so Chen Ping'an politely declined her company and headed upstairs.

After knocking on the door, the elder, seeing that this guest was unaccompanied by a Qingfu Pavilion girl, looked puzzled.

Chen Ping'an gazed at the large table, still adorned as it had been years ago, with a delicately scented incense burner and a lush ancient cypress bonsai, its branches twisting and turning, spreading long and wide. A row of tiny green-clothed figurines squatted on the branches; upon seeing a guest arrive, they all stood up, bowed, and spoke in unison, offering festive greetings, "Welcome esteemed guests to our humble shop, wishing you prosperity!"

Chen Ping'an removed his bamboo hat and burst into hearty laughter.

He was genuinely delighted.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 546: Better to Clear than to Block Water

After sharing a smile, Chen Ping’an clasped his fists together and said, “Mr. Hong, it’s good to see you again.”

The old man looked as vibrant as ever, his spirit shining through. For practitioners of the Dao, a few years could pass in the blink of an eye, leaving little mark on their appearance.

When Chen Ping’an saw the old swordsman in the blue robe, named Hong Yangbo, who had removed his bamboo hat, he felt puzzled. The business at Qinghua Workshop was unparalleled at the Dragon Mountain Fairy Ferry—people came and went regularly. It was entirely normal, yet the majority of the transactions occurred on the first floor, where the wealth of celestial beings turned. Few guests ventured to the second floor, and even fewer actually sat down to conduct business. If the old man had dealt with esteemed guests, he should have remembered them. However, looking at the young man in the wandering attire before him, he seemed unfamiliar, yet why was he so relaxed?

Nevertheless, since the newcomer was a guest and had addressed him as “Mr. Hong,” Hong Yangbo returned the greeting by clasping his fists and gestured for him to take a seat. He smiled and asked, “I wonder if you’re here to buy or sell?”

Chen Ping’an pulled over a beautifully crafted mahogany chair and sat down. The service here was ordinarily handled by the women of Qinghua Workshop, who would serve tea, fetch water, and negotiate deals. Their efforts were never in vain; after a transaction, they received a commission. Especially when a customer became a repeat patron, there was an additional reward. Chen Ping’an remembered that the woman from years ago was named Cui Ying, but this time he had no intention of buying or selling. Otherwise, he would have asked if Cui Ying was available downstairs. Meeting was a form of fate, and looking back, the transactions they had made were mutually enjoyable, a sign of good fortune—something practitioners of the Dao cherished deeply.

Just as Chen Ping’an was about to close the door, the old man waved his hand and said, “No need to close the door.”

Chen Ping’an hesitated for a moment but ultimately followed the old man’s suggestion and returned to his seat, smiling as he said, “I came to the Dragon Mountain Ferry this time mainly to visit you, Mr. Hong. You might not remember, but back in the day, I was with a big-bearded man and a young Taoist. We sold a few items here at your shop…”

The old man slapped the table, laughing, “I remember now! Those bamboo chopsticks were sold to me by you! Goodness, you’ve fulfilled a long-held wish of mine. I often take them out to play with, and touching those chopsticks feels like caressing the silky hair of the Bamboo Lady from Qing Shen Mountain…”

The old man didn’t continue, perhaps realizing he had been a bit too familiar.

Back then, Zhang Shan Feng had sold a pair of bamboo chopsticks from Qing Shen Mountain to the old man at a high price, as they were one of his prized possessions and had a significant markup.

The old man was in high spirits, recalling the memory, and stood up, calling out, “Qing Cai, hurry up and bring some good tea!”

Soon, a young woman dressed in a colorful brocade dress appeared from the hallway adorned with garments from the Land of Colorful Garments, gracefully presenting two cups of steaming tea to the two men. The elegantly proportioned woman didn’t leave the house but instead waited at the entrance.

Hong Yangbo, having spent half a century in Qinghua Workshop, had seen many customers. If he encountered someone he didn’t like, he would often put on a sour face, indifferent to whether they bought or sold. But for those he found pleasing, he was open-hearted and warm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have ended up chatting until the end of the day and even placing a small bet with Xu Yuanxia.

The old man smiled and asked, “What about that man with the unique vision, the big-bearded fellow? Why didn’t he come? I lost our bet back then when I bought your ancient Yu Kingdom’s Five Mountain Bowl, which caused Qinghua Workshop to incur a bit of loss. But that’s not important; it’s normal in business to have gains and losses. Besides, I’m good at appraising bronze items, calligraphy, and fine woods. Occasionally making mistakes is not surprising. But I owe that man a drink; I can’t keep owing him, can I? I don’t like being in debt. It weighs on my mind a little. How about I treat you to a drink outside Qinghua Workshop? Consider it settling the debt?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head and smiled, “Let my friend come to ask for the drink from Mr. Hong himself later.”

The old man looked a bit helpless but suddenly his eyes lit up. “Last time, you only sold, but I have some rare items that I usually don’t show to others, if you’d like to take a look? You don’t have to buy them; I’m not that kind of person. It’s just rare to encounter someone willing to do business with me, so I might as well show off a little and let the treasures breathe. They’re not hidden beauties meant to be kept away from prying eyes.”

Before Chen Ping’an could respond, the old man had already stood up, rummaging through his belongings. Soon he placed three variously sized brocade boxes on the table.

Carefully opening them, he revealed a piece of imperial pine soot ink, a clay figurine of a lady wearing a veil, and a calligraphy scroll.

With a proud expression, the old man said, “These three items are rare treasures on the second floor of Qinghua Workshop, filled with spiritual energy. Not to mention the clay figurine, the other two items are also highly cultured. They wouldn’t be considered light gifts, even if they were given to knowledgeable nobles of the secular world, let alone scholars from the Guanhua Academy!”

The old man pointed to the pine soot ink. “This piece of imperial pine soot ink from the Divine Water Kingdom was made from a thousand-year-old ancient pine and has a significant backstory; it was honored by the court as ‘Mr. Wood.’ The ancient pine is also known as ‘Unintoxicated Pine.’ There is a well-known tale about a literary giant who, after getting drunk in the mountains, encountered ‘someone’ blocking his way, and he pushed the pine aside, saying he was still sober. Unfortunately, after the Divine Water Kingdom fell, the ancient pine was destroyed, so this piece of ink may very well be a unique treasure.”

Pointing at the clay figurine, the old man’s eyes glowed with excitement. “I acquired this from a down-and-out wild practitioner many years ago. I practically stumbled upon a windfall! I only paid two hundred snowflake coins for it at that time. Later, a senior in the third floor appraised it and informed me that this figurine was part of a set of twelve, crafted by an exceptionally talented celestial being from the White Emperor City. It’s revered in later generations as the ‘Twelve Unparalleled’ figurines. The beauty of the veil is a small exquisite magical tool that can only reveal its true form when triggered, but unfortunately, I have yet to figure out how to activate it, so I can’t fully verify the identity of the figurine. Otherwise, this would undoubtedly be the prized centerpiece of Qinghua Workshop!”

Finally, the old man pointed at the calligraphy scroll and sighed. “Compared to the first two, this one isn’t as valuable. It’s a piece of calligraphy from a local sword immortal before their cultivation in the ancient Shu region. Although it’s a copy, it resembles a cicada shedding its shell, nearly rivaling the original. It’s titled ‘Regrettably Too Late,’ with the opening line stating, ‘Regrettably, the swordsmanship is lacking.’ This piece is exquisitely written, with fine content, but sadly, due to its age and poor preservation, much of its spiritual energy has dissipated, like a hero in decline, flickering like the last light of a candle. Truly, it’s a pity.”

Chen Ping’an had little interest in the divine water ink and the clay figurine, but when he examined the calligraphy scroll closely, he found his heart stirred. He had always been passionate about words and calligraphy, but his own writing lacked spirit—rigid and wooden, much like his chess skills. However, he had some understanding of others' calligraphy, thanks to the seal scripts from Mr. Qi, the many scrolls casually written by Cui Dongshan, and a specially purchased ancient calligraphy book during his travels. Over three hundred years in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he had witnessed the masterpieces of many renowned calligraphers, even if just fleetingly. The overall impression lingered in his memory.

Thus, although he had no plans to spend money at Qinghua Workshop, Chen Ping’an felt a twinge of desire. After all, from what Mr. Hong said, the imperial pine soot ink and clay figurine were certainly not cheap, but this scroll should not be excessively priced.

Chen Ping’an then inquired about the price, to which the old man raised a hand and shook it.

“Five small summer coins.”

The pair of bamboo chopsticks from Qing Shen Mountain had also cost this much.

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “I can’t afford that.”

It wasn’t that he didn’t like it; he simply couldn't part with five small summer coins. In the secular market, that was equivalent to five hundred thousand taels of silver! A big stack of calligraphy scrolls he bought from the mad, drunken county magistrate in Mei You Kingdom had only cost him five jugs of celestial wine, which totaled less than a small summer coin.

In business, one must always compare prices!

If he hadn’t had the experience of trading that stack of calligraphy scrolls with the down-and-out magistrate, perhaps he would have bought the chopsticks without hesitation, just like the last time.

The old man didn’t press further, knowing the other party was struggling with the price. Regardless, it was already worth it to him that this sword-wielding wanderer genuinely appreciated the scroll.

Just then, the colorful-dressed woman outside the door softly said, “Mr. Hong, why don’t you take out the most precious item from this room?”

The old man chuckled, “Qing Cai, it’s not like you brought him here. Even if I sell something from this room, it’s not worth half a copper coin to you, so what’s the fuss about?”

Clearly, the woman had a good relationship with the old man. She joked, “It’s good to enjoy the treasures while being blessed by the guests.”

She turned to Chen Ping’an and smiled, “Young sir, since you’re here, you must take a look at Mr. Hong’s prized item. It would be a shame not to.”

Chen Ping’an hadn’t intended to do so, but Hong Yangbo smiled and pointed, “You should hurry up and find a man to marry, lest you end up here every day, taking advantage of us old fellows at Qinghua Workshop. Well, since you’ve already seen three good items, one more won’t matter.”

Finally, the old man took out a square brocade box wrapped in gold thread. Upon opening it, a wave of coolness washed over them, yet it bore no hint of malevolence, just as pure and dignified as a solid winter snow.

Chen Ping’an leaned closer to see four demon-slaying talismans inside, all identical.

The old man turned each one over, smiling, “These represent Thunder Lord, Rain Master, Fire Deity, and Wind Mother, each designed to catch demons and subdue evil. This is a rare set of talismans, both beautiful and effective. There was once a royal scion from the Zhu Ying Dynasty who wanted to buy them, but his offered price fell slightly below my expectations. It wasn’t that I couldn’t sell them; it was just that he acted too arrogantly. Upon seeing my prized item, despite his inner glee, he put on a hypocritical facade of calmness, which annoyed me. Such tricks are fine in the market, but to show off in front of me was utterly disgraceful for the Zhu Ying Dynasty. I made an excuse and decided not to sell.”

The old man chuckled, “Even if you don’t buy, you can still hold them. They’re not common porcelain; they won’t break easily.”

Chen Ping’an picked up one of the talismans, examining both sides closely before retracting his gaze and asking, “How much?”

The old man replied, “A complete set of four, no splitting.”

He raised a hand again and shook it.

Of course, it wasn’t five small summer coins this time but rather gu yu coins.

Chen Ping’an asked with a smile, “Is there no room for negotiation?”

The old man shook his head. “Absolutely not. I wouldn’t dare to undervalue these precious treasures that have been passed down from the Aiai Continent.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “That royal scion from the Zhu Ying Dynasty, did he try to haggle down to four gu yu coins?”

The old man nodded with a smile.

Chen Ping’an grimaced, “Then I suppose I’m no different from him.”

He too wanted to haggle down to four gu yu coins, feeling an urge to take them all in one go. 

Money is dead, but people are alive.

After handing over the Tongye Branch to Wei Ban, before heading down the mountain, he had made two withdrawals of gu yu coins. One was five coins, which he kept on hand, thinking that five gu yu coins should cover any unexpected expenses during his travels. The other was to be sent to Shujian Lake, entrusted to Gu Can for organizing two grand celestial ceremonies and a water and land retreat.

If he ever encountered a treasure like the colorful golden coffin that Lu Yong owned, going for fifty gu yu coins, as long as it didn’t involve the foundations of the Dao, he would consider it a chance missed.

After all, these days were all about spending money. Other than the two shops in Qilong Alley that could earn dozens of taels of silver a month, none of the peaks, including the Lo Po Mountain, had brought in a single piece of celestial money.

It simply wouldn’t do to keep spending without earning.

The old man laughed heartily, “There’s still a difference; I find you much more pleasing to the eye. Just go ahead and haggle; I’ll never agree anyway.”

In an instant, Chen Ping’an had an idea and cautiously asked, “May I ask how much does Qinghua Workshop pay you annually for your offerings?”

The girl at the door stifled a laugh, clearly finding the question amusing.

If he really bought those four talismans, it would be one matter, but to attempt to pry into the finances of Qinghua Workshop, which had been the local tyrant of the Dragon Mountain Fairy Ferry for over ten generations, was another. The Baoguo Studio had previously encountered setbacks here, ultimately not choosing to set up shop.

Hong Yangbo appeared entertained, waving his hand dismissively, “Let’s not talk about that.”

Just when the old man was about to put away the brocade box containing the talismans, Chen Ping’an flipped his wrist and placed five gu yu coins on the table. “Mr. Hong, I’ll take it.”

The old man looked surprised. “You really want it? No regrets? Once you leave Qinghua Workshop, it’s a clean break—no returns.”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

The old man extended a finger, lightly touching one of the gu yu coins before releasing it. It was indeed genuine mountain gu yu money, filled with spiritual energy and orderly flow, unfeigned.

The old man asked again, “Are you sure?”

Chen Ping’an glanced at the other three boxes that had yet to be put away and smiled, “Is there any chance for an extra?”

The girl at the door couldn’t help but stifle a laugh, quickly turning away.

The old man half-jokingly responded, “If you help me repay that drink, then sure. How about it?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “That won’t do. Business is business.”

The old man shook his head, “Then forget it. It’s a fair price, and there’s no extra.”

“Fine, no extra it is. We can take it slow and talk about it later,” Chen Ping’an said, slightly adjusting his stance, concealing the view from the door as he stored the brocade box.

Finally, the old man personally escorted Chen Ping’an to the door. It wasn’t that he couldn’t take him to the main entrance of Qinghua Workshop on the first floor, but it was a taboo that could invite unnecessary conjecture and scrutiny.

Suddenly, the old man asked, “If you had agreed to drink earlier, which item would you have chosen as a bonus? The ‘Regrettably Too Late’ scroll?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “No, it would be that clay figurine.”

The old man chuckled, “Not a bad choice, but it isn’t the best. The most valuable is actually that piece of imperial pine soot ink, worth nine small summer coins. By that logic, if you had agreed to drink, I would have given you the set of talismans for just four gu yu coins, and I would have made a little profit of half a gu yu coin. Now, it’s just one and a half gu yu coins. Even after deducting Qinghua Workshop’s commission, I’d say I won’t have to worry about drinks for the rest of my life.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Then next time my friend comes to Qinghua Workshop, Mr. Hong, remember to treat him to a good drink, however expensive it may be.”

The old man nodded, “Of course.”

After crossing the threshold, Chen Ping’an told the girl not to see him off and then clasped his fists in farewell, “Mr. Hong, until we meet again.”

The old man returned the gesture, “No need for a far send-off. I hope we can continue doing business for a long time.”

With that, Chen Ping’an descended and left, taking a leisurely walk while leading his horse along the busy street outside Qinghua Workshop.

The set of talismans was intended as a gift for Zhong Kui at Taiping Mountain.

Earning money couldn’t be rushed; it wasn’t something one could force.

But just as Chen Ping’an turned back, he noticed the girl in the colorful dress quickly approaching, cradling a brocade box in her arms.

As Chen Ping’an paused, the girl named Qing Cai handed him the box with a smile. “Mr. Hong couldn’t bear to part with it and reluctantly gave you this figurine. You wouldn’t believe it, but when I took the box, it took a long time to pry it out of Mr. Hong’s hands.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said it was too much, but he didn’t hesitate as he took the box. The girl didn’t let go immediately, so Chen Ping’an gently tugged it free.

As she watched his retreating figure, she raised her hands, palms empty.

She shook her head with a smile and returned to Qinghua Workshop, where several women greeted her with lowered heads.

Outside the old man’s room on the second floor, Hong Yangbo stood respectfully at the door, smiling wryly. “Miss, seeing you serve tea personally surprised me.”

The girl smiled gently, “And seeing that customer trying to pry into your business surely startled you even more, right?”

The old man chuckled helplessly.

As the girl entered the room, she bent down and playfully poked at the small green-clad figures standing on the ancient cypress branches. Hong Yangbo stood beside her, puzzled. “Why did you have me give away that clay figurine?”

She teased the adorable green-robed children. “That man is likely the young sword immortal who appeared at Sword Water Villa.”

Hong Yangbo looked incredulous. “No way! Even if he could pull out five gu yu coins to buy that set of talismans, I’ve seen that person before, back when he was just a pure martial artist at most at the third realm…”

The girl said nonchalantly, “The world of Baoping is vast; are you saying there’s only one true martial mountain, Ma Kuxuan?”

The old man remained skeptical, unable to shake the feeling that the young man was the same sword immortal who had left Su Lang of the Songxi Kingdom empty-handed.

The girl suddenly said, “Don’t forget, I’m a sword practitioner too.”

The old man laughed, “You’re a natural talent, bestowed with the prophecy of ‘Earth Immortal Sword Practitioner’ at a young age. Business skills are a minor path.”

Straightening up, the girl clapped her hands. “Just now, when that person came up to the second floor of Qinghua Workshop, I happened to be cleaning an ancient sword in the ‘Chill’ room on the third floor. My sword heart wavered for a moment—it was fleeting, but undeniably real.”

The girl casually opened a brocade box on the table and unfolded the calligraphy scroll, her fingers tracing along the ink lines as she slowly said, “I suspect that man already realized I’m not just some servant girl of Qinghua Workshop. That’s why he didn’t bother to hide the fact that he was carrying a treasure or an item of significance. Moreover, when we parted ways on the street earlier, I intentionally glanced at the sword on his back. At that moment…”

The girl tilted her head back, hands behind her. “How do I say this? He looked like a clay Buddha on a divine altar. For someone like him, Qinghua Workshop giving away a clay figurine worth a few small summer coins is nothing. If he’s willing to accept it, then it’s a blessing for Qinghua Workshop.”

At this point, the girl’s finger lightly traced downwards, considering how that man had analyzed her and Hong Yangbo so thoroughly; he seemed like a different person entirely.

The old man wiped the sweat from his brow, realizing he had nearly missed a tremendous opportunity. He should not have made it difficult for him to give away an extra item just for a drink.

Suddenly, the woman asked, “Do you think he didn’t agree to drink because he, as a mountain-top sword immortal, looked down on you, or does he genuinely hope for his friend to drink with you?”

Hong Yangbo answered without hesitation, “Naturally, it’s the former.”

The girl laughed. “Then let’s not take a cut from the talismans today. Hong Yangbo, next time you treat someone to a drink, make it an expensive one—‘however expensive it may be.’”

The old man beamed, “That sounds good!”

Chen Ping’an led his horse away. After settling the payment, he would need to wait an hour or so at the ferry for the boat to set sail, looking up at the bustling ferries coming and going.

This ferry seemed even more prosperous than in the past. If Niujiao Mountain could enjoy even half of this bustle in the future, it would surely be able to thrive.

Whether it’s gold or celestial money, what’s feared is stagnation. Wealth has always preferred to move rather than sit still.

This was a casual remark from Cui Dongshan long ago; it felt trivial back then, but now Chen Ping’an found it resonated deeply within him.

Cui Dongshan's letter had reached his grandfather, Cui Cheng, but after leaving the Lo Po Mountain, there had been no news, as if he had vanished into the sea like a muddy cow.

Aside from the flattery and praise, which could be disregarded, the letter mentioned three major matters. One was about the landscape and trends of Baoping, which involved refining the five-colored earth of the new mountain as his destiny object. 

Another concerned Li Xisheng and the Li family of Fulu Street. Cui Dongshan hoped that Chen Ping’an could continue caring for the little Baoping while not feeling overly indebted to the Li family—maintaining their relationship at the level of mere acquaintances, avoiding further entanglements.

The last matter, however, was vague and brief, merely stating for him to wait a bit longer, as one could only shake the firm to its core gradually.

Yet Chen Ping’an knew exactly what Cui Dongshan was referring to.

It was about his destiny porcelain.

As Chen Ping’an’s thoughts drifted, autumn was drawing to a close, with the mournful wind swirling around the trees beneath a desolate sky.

Suddenly, someone hurriedly approached from behind and nearly collided with him. Chen Ping’an subtly stepped aside without drawing attention. The other person seemed caught off guard, halted for a moment, then hurried forward without looking back.

Chen Ping’an didn’t pursue it, knowing it was likely after leaving Qinghua Workshop that the girl had been given a brocade box in plain sight, attracting others’ envy.

Wild practitioners seeking wealth cared little for the code of the martial world.

In the southern mountains of Shujian Lake, he had killed numerous evil cultivators at the fifth realm—he couldn’t even count them on two hands. In the end, he had exchanged injuries with a golden elixir wild practitioner with whom he had no deep enmity. After that, they mutually left each other alone, without seeking revenge or stirring up trouble.

As Chen Ping’an turned back, he noticed two ash-colored children, a boy and a girl, standing timidly not far away, looking up at him with hopeful eyes. Each held open wooden boxes, selling small mountain trinkets that resembled porcelain bottles, little copper statues, and paintings. While they had little spiritual energy, they were decent enough for the wealthy to use as desk accessories, usually priced at one or two snowflake coins. However, compared to the prices in regular shops, they were quite expensive; this could be considered the smallest version of a pawn shop in the world. Yet, these children mostly sought warmth and sustenance.

Chen Ping’an carefully selected a few small items, bargaining until he finally purchased three objects for twelve snowflake coins: a “Forever Bestowed Blessings” tile inkstone, a pair of old pit yellow jade seals, and a glossy red shallow bowl. He planned to gift these to Pei Qian when he returned to Lo Po Mountain; after all, she didn’t care much for the price of a single item, only hoping to collect more.

After taking the snowflake coins from his sleeve, he stored the three items into his own sleeve.

The two children expressed their thanks and quickly scampered away, likely fearing that this generous soul might change his mind.

Their light footsteps echoed joyfully as they slowed down at a distance, whispering to one another.

Watching the two children’s innocent profiles filled with hope, Chen Ping’an chuckled.

Back in Lizhu Cave Heaven, each time he delivered a letter, he could earn a copper coin from Zheng Dafu. He guessed that at that time, his pace through Fulu Street and Taoye Alley would have been even more hurried than those two children.

Gazing at the sky, Chen Ping’an visited a tavern near the ferry and ordered a jug of Dragon Bone Wine. He didn’t go inside but instead sat by the roadside. Compared to the osmanthus brew from Old Dragon City and the crowing wine from Shujian Lake, this was considerably inferior. Of course, its price was low. It was said that the brewing water came from a spring halfway up Dragon Mountain, and the entire mountain’s spiritual energy was rumored to flow from a segment of dragon bone that a great sword immortal severed after a true dragon emerged from the earth.

Chen Ping’an sipped the wine leisurely, relishing this rare moment of tranquility. During this journey south, he had been mostly on the move, constantly calculating the time until he returned. It was rare to find himself in such a leisurely mindset.

Even though the horse was no longer restrained by reins, it remained obediently in place, occasionally lifting its hooves to lightly tap the stone slabs.

Chen Ping’an had always kept a watchful eye on it, ensuring it wouldn’t cause any trouble.

He had taken it to Lo Po Mountain to keep his steed, which he had named Qu Huang, company.

At this ferry, aside from practitioners, the other passersby were often either rich or noble. Chen Ping’an drank his wine, silently observing their behaviors, but only skimming the surface, his gaze flickering away in an instant.

Time flowed on.

Setting down the wine bowl, Chen Ping’an led his horse toward the ferry.

Once on board, he settled the horse and began practicing his Six Steps Zhuang technique inside the cabin. He couldn’t afford to fall behind Zhao Shuxia, whom he had taught boxing.

It seemed every time he took a ferry, he found himself practicing boxing again.

Late that night, he moved to the bow of the boat, sitting against the railing as the full moon hung overhead. The books claimed the moon is the brightest in one’s hometown, but it seemed none of the grand texts mentioned that in another world, from atop a city wall, gazing up one could witness a strange sight of the moon suspended in March—a view that would leave a lasting impression on any traveler.

Not far away, a pair of young ladies and gentlemen in splendid clothing approached, whispering sweet nothings to each other.

Chen Ping’an took off his sword-breeding gourd and had a sip of wine. Nowadays, drinking lacked the feelings of the past; whether in sorrow or joy, it felt more like a natural act, akin to drinking water in youth.

The shy young couple, caught off guard by the grand lantern hanging from the railing, had to take a longer route to avoid it. They whispered sweetly, with the young man’s hands constantly moving, causing the young woman to blush as she occasionally stole glances at the glaring lantern. Seeing that he seemed oblivious, she breathed a sigh of relief, allowing her partner to explore freely. After all, this trip down the mountain for their sect was mostly spent together, and such an opportunity for privacy was rare. They had agreed on a time to sneak out of their quarters.

Chen Ping’an leaned back and rested, crossing his legs and cradling his sword-breeding gourd.

Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a young man standing at a distance, looking despondent—plain-looking and certainly not as striking as the man whispering with the girl.

Chen Ping’an chose not to look further.

After the dejected man left, an irate old woman soon emerged from the ship’s side, causing the couple to immediately separate.

The previously bold young man took a step back, lowering his head, while the shy young woman bravely stepped forward to meet the gaze of her elder. 

The old woman scolded fiercely before waving her sleeve and leaving.

The young woman covered her face and wept, while the young man comforted her gently.

From the old woman’s words, Chen Ping’an learned that this group of cultivators from the Songxi Kingdom was headed to Yunxia Mountain for a ceremony, where someone had just become a golden elixir earthly immortal. The elder, as a senior member of their sect, had lost her temper and restricted the girl from ascending the mountain, allowing her only to wait at the foot. Throughout her scolding, it was clear she favored the young man. Had there not been an outsider present, the old woman likely wouldn’t have stopped at merely calling her a “siren.”

Once the old woman left, the young man was articulate and quickly brought a smile back to the girl’s face. Her tear-streaked smile was like the sun breaking after rain, utterly enchanting.

Chen Ping’an lightly sighed, keeping his gaze fixed on the starry sky.

After the couple returned to their respective quarters, another person approached the boat railing, looking lost and confused. He secretly reported to his elder, but whether out of guilt or cowardice, he leaned against the railing, staring blankly at the night sky.

Suddenly, he turned his head. “I advise you not to speak carelessly.”

Time flows like a river, ever moving, with life filled with passing guests.

Chen Ping’an paid no mind to the young immortal’s threat.

The young man grew furious. “Are you deaf?!”

Chen Ping’an nodded slowly. “Yes, I’m deaf.”

The young man froze, his anger boiling. “Are you seeking death?!”

Chen Ping’an replied slowly, “Conversing with a deaf person—isn’t that foolish?”

The young man’s rage flared, his face turning red as he stormed off. But halfway through, he suddenly stopped. Remembering the teachings of his sect and the rumors of the martial world, he reluctantly chose to abandon his impulse.

However, this made him appear indecisive, vacillating between whether to continue provoking Chen Ping’an or simply leave, avoiding further trouble.

Chen Ping’an asked, “If you really did manage to break apart that couple, do you think you’d win her heart? Or do you believe that even if you took a step back, merely to hold her in your arms is enough?”

The young disciple remained silent.

Chen Ping’an sat up and turned to smile. “She’s your senior sister, right? So the man she likes and the one who likes her seem to be less than ideal. Do you think such a girl is not pitiable? Or do you think you can wait? Wait for the day your senior sister is let down, heartbroken, then you can take advantage of her vulnerability? After securing your hold, you could cast her aside as if she were worthless, as a form of revenge?”

The young disciple clenched his fists tightly, veins bulging.

Chen Ping’an smiled. “Delving into human hearts reveals how dull they are. No wonder you mountain practitioners often have to introspect; if your heart isn’t cultivated, it’ll only grow weeds.”

The young disciple’s expression shifted slightly.

From his tone, it seemed that this man was not a practitioner?

Then was he merely a swordsman from the martial world?

He merely shot a glance at Chen Ping’an, and in an instant, it felt as if cold water had been splashed over him—an incredibly bizarre sensation.

The young disciple fled in a panic, disregarding his dignity, knowing that this parting would guarantee they would never meet again.

Chen Ping’an took a deep breath. After Shujian Lake, the solution he had devised was still of little use. At that time, Cui Cheng had revealed the truth—there was no distinction between the good and evil of the human heart; that was the most terrifying aspect. Even more terrifying, as Cui Cheng had put it, was that Chen Ping’an’s memory was too good, too accustomed to scrutinizing details. After having profited greatly in the past, he was destined to suffer equally in the future.

Better to clear than to block water.

He really should set off for Beiju Luzhou soon. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 547: Jiang Qingyue Approaches (Part 1)**

Before he knew it, the ferry had already entered the mountainous and deep waters of the Huangting Kingdom. 

Chen Pingan stood at the bow of the boat, admiring the scenery. The ferry had kindly lowered its floating height, allowing it to brush closely against treacherous peaks at times, with birds accompanying them in the air. 

As a territory that split off from Ancient Shu, this area was known for its many mountain-dwelling sages who would connect various forces, following local records and urban rumors. They often paid local immortal families and the Huangting dynasty to extensively explore rivers, forcing them to change course and exposing riverbeds in search of the so-called Dragon Palace secret realms. Wild cultivators frequently came here, hoping to pick up scraps or chance upon fortunes. The blind old Daoist and his two disciples had once entertained similar thoughts, but luck was ethereal; unless a cultivator was wealthy enough to grease palms and cast a wide net, it was hard to gain anything from such ventures.

The ferry’s destination was Changchun Palace, located north of the capital of the Great Li Dynasty. They would pass by Niujiao Mountain in Longquan County, but Chen Pingan did not plan to disembark there. Following his predetermined route, he intended to first visit the residence that once belonged to the bride-dressed ghost to check on Gu Can’s father, and then quickly return to Luopo Mountain via familiar routes along Xiuhua River, Hongzhu Town, Qidun Mountain, and Tiebiao River, using a stance akin to sword control. Riding a horse would be too slow and would risk missing the intercontinental ferry to Beijulu Island.

Since a ferry couldn’t land solely for one passenger, Chen Pingan had already made arrangements with the ferry staff to leave his horse at Niujiao Mountain. He asked them to inform the people at Niujiao ferry to send the horse to Luopo Mountain.

The ferry manager wore a troubled expression; after all, merely flying over the Great Li territory was enough to make anyone anxious. They feared that a careless passenger might accidentally spit over the rail, landing on the Great Li sages’ mountain, which would lead to a swift destruction by the local cultivators using their treasures—leaving no trace behind. Moreover, Niujiao ferry was the penultimate stop on this route, guarded by a group of Great Li cavalry. They had no courage to engage in dealings beyond loading and unloading goods.

Chen Pingan explained further, saying he had a good relationship with Niujiao Mountain and that with his own mountain next to the ferry, the issue of the horse wouldn’t cause any trouble.

The old manager wore a mournful face, neither rejecting nor accepting his request. Eventually, it was only after Chen Pingan secretly slipped him a few snowflake coins that the old cultivator reluctantly agreed. 

The real reason was not the few coins but rather the young man’s identity as a Great Li citizen; they didn’t dare offend him too much. Since he owned Luopo Mountain, he was a local power. This ferry route was established with great effort and resources from their ancestors, and they would be seeing each other often. Helping him out today could lead to future favors, as the longer they interacted, the more intricate their ties would become. Who knew when a favor might come in handy?

Fortunately, the young man was perceptive. After gaining a favor, he reciprocated by inviting the old manager to visit Luopo Mountain whenever they stopped the ferry, introducing himself as Chen Pingan, with wine and tea available on the mountain.

This brought a genuine smile to the old manager’s face. Regardless of whether the sentiment was sincere or feigned, for a young swordsman to say such a thing was better than silence. In business, knowing a name often sufficed; it didn’t necessarily mean they had to be real friends. Once it fell on others' ears, they would naturally read into it.

A few days later, the ferry had entered Great Li territory. Chen Pingan looked down at the landscapes, greeted the old manager, and then unsheathed his sword, leaping over the railing.

Stepping onto a golden thread, he swiftly arced down to the ground.

The old manager, slapping the railing, was filled with surprise. He made a mental note to learn more about this “Chen Pingan” when he reached Niujiao Mountain, curious about who this individual was that masked himself so deeply. After all, regular cultivators usually didn’t travel the world with just a horse.

Landing on the familiar path, Chen Pingan no longer needed to rely on the sunlight and lantern symbols to guide him. He approached a mountain wall, gently tapping it as if knocking on a door, without using a barrier-breaking talisman to force his way in. He had previously done so and was ridiculed by the water deity of Xiuhua River, who wrapped a green snake around his arm and scolded him according to the laws of Great Li Mountain, leaving with a warning not to repeat it. Although it seemed the deity was overbearing, Chen Pingan was indeed in the wrong. Thus, even if he were a true sword immortal one day, he would still need to “knock” before entering.

Ripples spread out, and the mountain water barrier opened abruptly. Chen Pingan stepped inside, his vision suddenly expanding.

Furrowing his brows, Chen Pingan walked slowly, surveying his surroundings. The atmosphere here was far better than before. The mountain and water formations were stable, and spiritual energy was abundant—these were all good signs. It seemed that Gu Can's father, as the new lord of the residence, had made achievements in repairing the mountain roots over the past three years. In the realm of mountain deities, such accomplishments would be documented by the Ministry of Rites and preserved by the Ministry of Personnel. However, Gu Can’s father hadn’t come to greet him today, which was rather unexpected.

Previously, on his return to Luopo Mountain, Chen Pingan had inquired in detail about this “Xiushui Gaofeng” Chu family residence from Wei Ban. The old residence and the new lord were under Wei Ban’s jurisdiction as the North岳 deity. Wei Ban was well-informed but had also mentioned that the Ministry of Rites and the Department of Rituals would specifically handle several hidden lines directly “involved” with the court. Even Wei Ban only had the right to know, not to interfere. This old residence of the Chu family was among them and had only been reclassified last winter, essentially being unraveled from the North岳 mountains. During Chen Pingan’s contract signing with the Great Li court at Piyun Mountain, the Deputy Minister of Rites had also mentioned this matter to Wei Ban, providing only casual remarks to avoid raising Wei Ban’s suspicions. Wei Ban naturally had no objections and was not foolish; if he treated all nominal North岳 territories as forbidden zones, then even the capital of Great Li would count as his territory. Could he really go into the capital and act recklessly?

As for Gu Can’s father, according to official reports, Gu Tao had remained in seclusion for the past three years, diligently repairing the mountain and water energy, earning high praise. The court was about to reward and appoint him. It was said that Wei Ban and Zhu Lian had even made a bet on the matter of Gu Tao’s appointment, writing down their answers on slips of paper and leaving them with a girl in a pink skirt. The loser would treat the other to drinks. Wei Ban had even asked Chen Pingan to guess the positions they had written down. Chen Pingan had no way to guess and, besides, had pressing matters with the martial arts lessons awaiting him on the second floor, leaving him quite overwhelmed. Now, he regretted not having prepared more mentally for this. Wei Ban had also mentioned that Gu Can’s mother, upon moving back to the ancestral home in the Mud Bottle Alley, had immediately sought out Gu Tao. However, even though she had entered the realm of mountain and water, it seemed the couple, separated between yin and yang, had not been able to meet.

Today, the water deity of Xiuhua River, clad in golden armor, awaited Chen Pingan at the entrance of the residence.

However, compared to the tense atmosphere during their last encounter, this time, the water deity appeared much more amiable than the older, more authoritative water deity from Tiebiao River.

Chen Pingan clasped his fists in greeting, saying, “Greetings, Lord Water Deity.”

The Xiuhua River water deity nodded in acknowledgment, “Are you here to reminisce with Lord Gu Tao, or are you seeking revenge against Lady Chu?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “I’m here to see Uncle Gu.”

Since the matter regarding the Book Lake had concluded, there was no need for excessive formality. No one was foolish. This loyal Xiuhua River water deity had clearly been acting on the secret instructions of the national teacher, Cui Zhan. Perhaps he had even helped Chen Pingan and Uncle Gu in their charade back then, allowing him to change routes and arrive at Book Lake early enough to prevent a greater deadlock. If he had delayed by another month, once Ruan Xiu and the group of sticky bamboo youths clashed with Gu Can on Qingxia Island, it would have been a fierce conflict. The Dao would guide them, and if either side suffered casualties, it would have been an unimaginable disaster for Chen Pingan.

Thus, this water deity, who had once failed to supervise effectively, might have already faced repercussions from Cui Zhan.

The water deity gently stroked the green snake coiled around their arm and smiled, “Chen Pingan, I’m still a bit annoyed about being played for a fool back then, but you must rest assured that as long as it’s official business, I won’t let personal grievances affect my duties.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Since you can appear here, Lord Water Deity, I trust you will uphold this integrity. From now on, we are neighbors of mountain and water; let’s treat each other as such.”

The towering Xiuhua River water deity looked at him with appreciation. His words weren’t merely flattering; they were clearly suggesting that since he, as the water deity neighboring Longquan County, would not let public matters interfere with private affairs, then if personal grievances arose one day, it would naturally be resolved through private means. The young man’s response was very fitting; he neither made threats nor showed weakness.

The water deity pointed behind them and smiled, “Repairing the mountain roots is a long and arduous task. This time, I’m not intentionally making things difficult for you and Gu Tao by not allowing you to reminisce; it's just that he’s currently unable to free himself. However, if you wish, you can come in and sit; I can pour you a drink on behalf of Gu Tao. In fact, regarding Lady Chu, I have some private words I’d like to share with you. Many past events won’t be recorded in the Ministry of Rites archives, but after a few drinks, discussing some harmless topics won’t break any rules. What do you think, Chen Pingan? Would you consider granting me this favor?”

Chen Pingan nodded and smiled, “Competing in drinking with a water deity isn’t very wise, so I’ll just grit my teeth and take this challenge.”

They entered the residence together, walking side by side. Chen Pingan asked, “Has the spirit banquet at Piyun Mountain already concluded?”

The Xiuhua River water deity replied, “You might not expect it, but three of the old Five Sacred Deities of Great Li have gone to Piyun Mountain for the feast, along with many deities from vassal states. Since Great Li established itself as a nation, we’ve never seen such a grand night banquet. Lord Wei, as the host, is truly extraordinary; I’m not just flattering my superior. Lord Wei’s divine presence is unmatched, and I don’t know how many female deities have fallen for him. After the night banquet, many lingered, reluctant to leave.”

Mentioning Wei Ban, the “Land Deity of Qidun Mountain,” the Xiuhua River water deity seemed genuinely impressed.

Thinking of how, on his own mountain at Luopo, he was perceived as an idler while looking at someone like Wei Ban, Chen Pingan couldn’t help but feel a bit envious.

Once seated in the brightly lit hall, only a few ghostly maidservants attended, and the water deity waved them away.

The water deity produced two jars of rice wine infused with the essence of Xiuhua River, tossing one to Chen Pingan. They each drank.

The water deity clearly had a prior acquaintance with the old owner of the residence, Lady Chu. Her words were straightforward; she didn’t expect Chen Pingan to become friends with her but hoped he wouldn’t pursue a vendetta against her. The water deity recounted the story of the bride-dressed ghost and the Great Li scholar, how she had once been kind to others and deeply infatuated with that scholar. She didn’t hide her violent actions after feeling betrayed; she mentioned the corpses she had planted in her garden as if they were “flowers and plants,” which still lingered there, full of resentment, unable to find peace.

When mentioning the tragic fate of that poor scholar at Guanhua Academy, the water deity’s expression turned solemn as she took a sip of wine. “Before Great Li’s prosperity, any aspiring scholar faced disdain and grievances outside. The more talented they were, the harsher the oppression. This scholar is a prime example; one of those who harmed him was a scion of the Great Sui aristocracy, who now occupies a central position in the court!”

The water deity gazed outside the hall, lamenting, “How can one justify such a muddled account?”

Chen Pingan took a sip of wine, slowly replying, “If we truly want to talk about it, it’s not impossible. It’s just a matter of order, step by step. However, there’s one crucial premise: that person who seeks justice must bear the cost of that justice.”

The water deity chuckled, “Why not give it a try? Lady Chu is too involved; you, Chen Pingan, are half insider, half observer. If you’re willing, consider it a huge favor owed to you.”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “I’m not in the mood for that, nor do I have any reason to do so.”

The water deity had no expectations, so there was no disappointment—only some regret. She raised her wine jar, “Then let’s just drink.”

Chen Pingan raised his jar in response; the wine was fine, surely expensive, so he planned to drink as little as possible, treating it as a means to earn back some money.

Aside from the bride-dressed ghost, there wasn’t much for them to discuss, so Chen Pingan soon stood up to take his leave. The Xiuhua River water deity personally escorted him to the entrance of the mountain water barrier.

Watching Chen Pingan clasp his fists in farewell, then unsheathing his long sword with a clang, he ascended into the air, drifting away into the sea of clouds.

Even though he had previously glimpsed the sword immortal’s splendor through the water curtain, seeing it up close still left the Xiuhua River water deity in shock.

Chen Pingan landed just outside Hongzhu Town, walking into it. He paused for a moment by the inn, then continued forward, first catching sight of Fushui Bay in the distance before heading to Guanshui Street, which intersected with Guanshan Street. He found the bookstore there and was pleasantly surprised to see the young storekeeper—handsome as ever, dressed in an ink-colored long robe, holding a folding fan, seated on a small bamboo chair, eyes closed in relaxation, sipping tea from a delicate teapot and humming a tune while patting his knee with the fan. As for the bookstore’s business, he seemed entirely unconcerned.

The young storekeeper, just like years ago, opened his eyes lazily, “The prices of the books are clearly marked; it’s up to you to decide.”

Years ago, Chen Pingan had purchased a seemingly newly published book titled *Great Water Cliff* for nine taels and two coins here to help Li Huai. It turned out to be an old book, containing a spirit-touched essence. Li Huai truly had luck wherever he went.

At the Qingfu Workshop near Delong Mountain’s ferry, Chen Pingan had first laid eyes on the clay figurine of the Miji Mud Girl, as its craftsmanship was likely part of the same set as Li Huai’s clay dolls, both crafted by the immortal hands of the White Emperor City as described by Hong Yangbo. Even if the “Qingfu Workshop Maid’s Charm” that bore insufficient sword intent wasn’t gifted to him, he would find a way to acquire it. As for the divine water country’s specially crafted pine soot ink, Chen Pingan simply didn’t have the money to buy it at that moment, planning to ask Wei Ban, who was once the mountain deity of the divine water country, if it was worth purchasing once he returned to Luopo Mountain.

However, that wasn’t the reason Chen Pingan was here. In truth, this young storekeeper, who had transformed from a river spirit into a human figure, had now risen to become the officially appointed water deity of the Chongdan River by the Great Li court since the establishment of the nation—truly a classic case of a “carp leaping over the dragon gate.”

Like the Xiuhua River water deity, they were now neighbors. For those on the mountain, this distance was merely a stroll from Mud Bottle Alley to Xinghua Alley.

Chen Pingan didn’t feel the need to ingratiate himself; it wasn’t necessary or useful. However, passing by, he thought it only right to greet him.

In times of adversity, one must regard oneself with importance; in times of prosperity, one must regard others with importance. 

These truths, which could easily be gleaned from the muddy paths of Mud Bottle Alley, should not be forgotten as one climbs higher into the mountains. 

Chen Pingan picked a few books that could be considered well-preserved and suddenly turned to ask, “Storekeeper, if I were to buy all the books in your shop, what discount could you offer me?”

The handsome young storekeeper opened his eyes, irritated. “This little shop is how I make my living. If you buy everything, what will I do with a sack of silver? Go drink flower wine at Fushui Bay? Based on my looks, who could take advantage of whom is still up in the air. So, what discount? Eleven percent? Twelve percent? Are you buying or not?!”

Chen Pingan nodded and smiled, “I’ll buy.”

The young storekeeper set aside his teapot, snapped open his fan, and waved it lightly in front of him, smiling, “Not for sale!”

With no choice, Chen Pingan had to give up, paying more than thirty taels of silver for a few ancient books.

Once the silver was exchanged, the storekeeper smiled as he saw Chen Pingan to the door, “Welcome back anytime.”

Seeing the expression on his face, Chen Pingan knew he had gotten the short end of the stick.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 548: Jiang Qingyue Approaches (Part Two)

After Chen Ping'an left Guanshui Street, the shopkeeper returned to his chair, closed his eyes for a moment, then got up to close the shop and headed toward the riverbank.

Red Candle Town is a major commercial hub near Longquan County, where the Xiu Hua, Yu Ye, and Chong Dan rivers converge. The capital is currently undergoing extensive construction, with dust flying everywhere and a cacophony of noise. It is expected that not only will Red Candle Town be incorporated into Longquan County, but it will soon become the seat of a new county. In addition, Longquan County is set to be upgraded to a state, and both the mountains and the officialdom below are bustling. Particularly with the presence of Cloudy Peak, countless water deities are vying to gather here. It should be noted that water deities are not merely content with a single shrine or statue to oversee their mountains; they have connections with mountain immortals, court officials, and people from the martial world, which extends their influence. Thus, the rapid rise of the new state of Dali, with Cloudy Peak and Longquan County City as its two major centers, is unstoppable.

Once the young man in black reached the riverbank, he performed a trick to conceal his presence, stepping into the water and strolling leisurely within the gentlest waters of the Xiu Hua River.

The three rivers have distinct characteristics: the waters of the Xiu Hua River are soft and long, brimming with spiritual energy (Qi), while the Chong Dan River is swift and turbulent, with properties that contradict its name. The Yu Ye River has the shortest course, with the most unpredictable waters and uneven distribution of spiritual energy. Among these rivers lies the water deity's abode, which is a prime feng shui location. Do not underestimate this; if a Golden Elixir (Jindan) earth immortal were to choose a place among the three rivers to settle, they would undoubtedly opt to serve as a guest elder of the Yu Ye River. In the mountains, this is referred to as a treasure that is priceless yet difficult to obtain.

The Xiu Hua River lies within the jurisdiction of a colleague. Unless visiting the water deity's abode, the young man in black would normally be considered to have crossed boundaries. However, the water spirits responsible for patrolling the rivers did not find the black-clad river deity strange; on the contrary, they approached him with smiles. This was not because the new Chong Dan River deity was easygoing, but rather to irritate him intentionally. The black-clad river deity did not bother to respond in kind, keeping his expression neutral and saying only that he was headed to Mantou Mountain, where two tributaries converge. Once he distanced himself enough, the armored spirits erupted in laughter, openly mocking the black-clad river deity's qualifications and suggesting he had relied on underhanded means to ascend to his position, unlike their own Xiu Hua River deity, who had solid accomplishments in life and death to support his status. They viewed him as nothing more than a pitiful carp, unworthy of their regard.

Upon arriving at the small land temple located on an island in the river, the shrimp and crab spirits of the Yu Ye and Xiu Hua Rivers looked down on this place, and the county and town deities were even less inclined to pay attention. Mantou Mountain, being the least notable land deity in the country's geography, was akin to a stone in a latrine—stinky and hard.

The small shrine still lacked incense offerings and was precarious in its existence. The locals were disinterested in burning incense here, as they had to take a ferry to reach it, which was a hassle. With numerous deities' shrines scattered across the three rivers, who wouldn't prefer to seek a higher-ranked deity? 

As the young man in black stepped over the threshold, a short and disheveled man sat on the altar, while a young acolyte in red was making a fuss inside the old brass incense burner, sitting in it while beating his hands, covered in incense ash, lamenting loudly, mixed with complaints about his master’s lack of ambition. The black-clad river deity was not surprised; it was already unusual for a land temple to have such a small, incense-burning spirit. This acolyte was particularly bold, lacking respect for hierarchy, and enjoyed wandering about aimlessly. When he was bullied by others from the city god temple, he would return to vent his frustrations on his master, often declaring that in his next life, he would seek a better incense burner to be reincarnated in—truly a local oddity.

Even upon realizing that a river deity had arrived, the man showed no sign of acknowledgment.

However, the palm-sized red-clad acolyte quickly jumped up, placing his hands on the edge of the incense burner, and loudly said, “Lord River Deity, what brings you here today? Please, make yourself at home! It’s a bit cramped and the incense offerings are lacking; we don’t even have a fruit plate or a cup of hot tea. I’m really neglecting you, Lord River Deity—my apologies, my apologies…”

The man slapped down, sending the red-clad acolyte tumbling into the ash to silence him.

The black-clad river deity moved a rickety chair from the far corner and sat down, glancing at the little fellow peeking from the incense burner, smiling as he asked, “Such a big deal, and you didn’t even tell your little companion?”

The man replied flatly, “It’s not like anything is decided yet; what’s there to say?”

The black-clad river deity pulled out a folding fan and lightly tapped the armrest, smiling, “Yet, there’s a difference between good news and bad news; you seem to be quite patient.”

This man had sat on the cold bench for several hundred years, with no hope of promotion, which was understandable. Otherwise, he would have at least climbed to a county god position. Many of his old acquaintances had done well for themselves, so it was no wonder the red-clad acolyte complained daily, idly lounging on the temple roof, waiting for a pie to fall from the sky. The man, with an indifferent expression, said, “After all these years, I’ve not had a mouthful of hot food, and I haven’t complained; why should I care about these few days?”

Such words would not sit well with anyone.

The red-clad acolyte rolled his eyes, muttering to himself. Good news? Good news could never come to their master! Just keeping the land temple’s identity would be a blessing; he should be off paying respects at every mountain god, river god, and city god shrine. Now, he was completely disheartened; as long as he wasn’t kicked out of the temple or forced to carry the incense burner around, that would already be a tremendous blessing. Recently, rumors circulated among the city god temples that after Longquan County upgraded to a state, all the deities would have to be reorganized. This time, he even resorted to acting pitiful to plead for a new position, but his master still refused to budge, even to attend the night banquet hosted by the Great God of the Northern Mountain. It was said that Mantou Mountain would soon face disaster. This left him anxious every day, wishing he could perish together with his master, so he could at least hope for a better reincarnation in the next life.

The black-clad river deity said helplessly, “Even if others don’t mention it, you shouldn’t ignore your old friends. We’ve been through so much together; isn’t that enough to warrant a bit of concern? I didn’t even get a greeting when I built this temple.”

The man retorted, “If I go, will you appreciate me more? It’s still just a trifling friendship. If I come to congratulate you, there should be some acknowledgment, right? I have no money in my pockets; I can’t afford to put on a show.”

The red-clad acolyte became furious, standing up with hands on hips, glaring at his master, “How dare you speak to the Lord River Deity like that?! You ungrateful fool, quickly apologize to the Lord River Deity!”

The man shot a sidelong glance at him.

The red-clad acolyte was on the verge of tears, turning to the black-clad river deity, mustering all his strength to squeeze out a few tears, “Lord River Deity, you and my master are old friends; please help me persuade him. At this rate, I won’t even get to eat ash; my life is so miserable…”

The black-clad river deity joked, “It’s not like the city god hasn’t invited you to move to his mansion; you could pick any incense burner or plaque you want. What great fortune! Since you know your life is hard, why not enjoy the good days instead of enduring hardship here?”

The red-clad acolyte slapped his chest, the force miscalculated, causing him to spit out a mouthful of incense ash. After a few coughs, he declared loudly, “This is called integrity!”

Once he finished boasting, his stomach growled, and feeling a bit embarrassed, he prepared to climb out of the incense burner, thinking he’d rather starve than be a burden to the two companions.

Unexpectedly, the man pulled out a stick of incense from his sleeve, rubbing it between his fingers until a spark ignited. It was clearly the cheapest quality, which he tossed into the incense burner. The red-clad acolyte lunged forward, complaining that even pigs would eat better than this, but quickly sat back down in the pile of ash, holding the stick of incense, gnawing on it like sugarcane, swaying his head, with a face full of happiness.

The black-clad river deity burst into laughter, opening his fan to create a refreshing breeze, mist filling the air, invigorating and delightful.

The man hesitated for a moment before saying seriously, “Please pass on a message to Wei Ba and the officials you know in the Ministry of Rites. If it’s not the state’s city god, but just a county or town city god, don’t contact me. I’ll stay right here.”

The black-clad river deity frowned, “You truly want it that way?”

The man scratched his head, his expression distant, gazing at the rushing river outside the temple!

The black-clad river deity teased, “You’re so close with Wei Ba; if I recall correctly, you did him and that poor girl a great favor back in the day. Why not tell him yourself?”

The man sneered, “I merely did something that felt right; what’s so special about that? Should I expect a return? Then what’s the difference between me and those scheming for promotions and wealth? This new city god business isn’t something I’m asking Dali for; I’ve made my stance clear. Ultimately, it’s their choice who to select; choosing me might not be a good thing, and not choosing me isn’t bad either. I’ll make it easy on everyone.”

The black-clad river deity nodded, “Alright, I’ll pass on your message. As for the rest, you’ll have to fend for yourself. If it works out, that’s one thing, but I see it as unlikely. If it doesn’t, you’ll undoubtedly face difficulties from the new state city god. You might not even need him to intervene; the county and town city gods will be overly attentive, constantly testing you.”

The man appeared indifferent.

Naturally, the Wenwu Temple need not be elaborated upon, as it would undoubtedly worship the ancestors of the Yuan and Cao families. The other various mountain and water deities had all played their parts: Longxu River, Tiefu River, Luo Po Mountain, and Fengliang Mountain. The two vacant city god seats, along with the soon-to-be-appointed state city god, had become the last three bargaining chips. The Yuan and Cao families had to secure at least one of these three, merely quarreling over the prefix of the state, as no one dared to snatch it. After all, two of the main generals from the Dali Southern Expedition’s iron cavalry were Cao Ping, a scion of the Cao family, and Su Gaoshan, the one who speaks for the Yuan family in the military. The Yuan family had shown great favor to Su Gaoshan, who hailed from the border army’s cold tribes, and he had not forgotten the Yuan maiden, earning him the nickname of half son-in-law among the Dali officialdom.

This involved a complex web of official connections, requiring local deities to showcase their abilities.

The red-clad acolyte, busy “gnawing on sugarcane” to fill his stomach, lifted his head, dazed, and asked, “What were you just talking about?”

The man replied irritably, “I was pondering who your parents might be.”

The river deity began discussing the previous customer from the bookstore, sharing his guesses.

The man’s expression turned serious.

The red-clad acolyte, feeling satisfied after filling his belly, burped, and cheerfully said, “You wouldn’t believe it, but I just made a friend from Longquan County! Not long ago, I went to Red Candle Town for some fun. I wandered a bit far, and at Qidun Mountain, I met two girls, one big and one small, who said they were waiting for someone. One was really pretty, and the other… well, I won’t lie just because we got close; she’s not that beautiful. But I still got along better with her; we hit it off. She insisted on asking where the biggest wasp nest was. Of course, I knew the answer and took them there. The nest was so huge it was practically alive! In the end, guess what happened? Those two girls were chased by a swarm of wasps, getting stung until they looked like two big pig heads! I was heartbroken at the time, shedding quite a few tears. But they were loyal and didn’t blame me for leading them there. They even invited me to visit a place called Luo Po Mountain. The one I got along with really well, she’s so righteous and impressive, saying she’s the first disciple of her master. Once I arrive at Luo Po Mountain, I’ll have a great time with food and fun!”

The man quickly seized upon the key point, frowning as he asked, “With your little bit of courage, you dared to meet strangers?!”

The red-clad acolyte huffed, “I was hiding underground! It was that little girl who pulled me out with a stick, saying if I kept sneaking around, she’d use her immortal arts to kill me. I later realized I had been tricked; she simply saw me, but she didn’t have the power to drag me out. Well, it turned out to be a good encounter. You wouldn’t believe it; this girl who looks like a little black coal has such broad knowledge, noble status, exceptional talent, and wealthy family background. She’s quite the figure in the martial world…”

The red-clad acolyte’s face was filled with admiration, and suddenly he remembered something. Squatting in the pile of ash, he threw out a copper coin the size of his palm, “Look, this is a reward for guiding me! Isn’t that generous? Do you have friends like that?”

The man scoffed, “Is that a Xiaoshu coin or a Guyu coin? Bring it closer so I can see.”

The red-clad acolyte quickly hid the coin again, rolling his eyes, “She said for someone like me, who deals with divine money year-round, giving those divine coins is too vulgar. I think that makes sense!”

The black-clad river deity shook his fan, smiling, “That does make a lot of sense.”

The man was too lazy to engage with this clueless little thing.

As night fell.

By the Tiefu River.

A swordsman in a blue robe walked alone.

In the past, the Li Zhu Cave Heaven, now known as the Li Zhu Blessed Land, adhered to the rules set by the sage Ruan Qiong, which have always been effective.

The wild expanse stretches low under the trees, the river’s clear moon drawing near.

Approaching that river deity temple.

A woman holding a golden-tassel sword appeared on the path. Upon seeing the swordsman’s long sword on his back, her eyes glowed with enthusiasm as she asked, “Chen Ping’an, may I challenge you to a duel as a swordsman?”

Chen Ping’an glanced at her, recognizing her as the former sword-wielding maid of a palace lady, now one of the highest-ranked river deities in Dali, and replied with a single phrase.

“I’m afraid I might kill you.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 549: The Heart Must Contain the Sun and Moon

The river goddess Yang Hua of Iron Symbol River did not lose her temper, but her golden eyes brimmed with an intense scrutiny that felt almost reckless as she carefully regarded the young swordsman before her once more.

As night fell, Yang Hua, in her divine form, radiated a layer of golden light from her elegant attire, making her already stunning beauty even more mesmerizing. The moon above the river mirrored the brilliance of this goddess of the river, like a piece of exquisite jewelry adorning her.

In contrast, the young man across from her lacked her air of "otherworldly independence."

Years ago, Yang Hua had assessed Chen Ping'an with the same penetrating gaze. At that time, he had been a boy in straw sandals, and she could only detect a faint aura of poverty and a hint of martial intent.

At this moment, aside from a few external objects, she seemed unable to discern much else about him. For example, there was the sword nurturing gourd chosen by Wei Ban hanging at his waist, and a blue robe that could hardly be called a proper robe. Of course, the most crucial aspect was the sword behind Chen Ping'an.

Yang Hua had always been extremely confident in her swordsmanship, and the golden-tasselled longsword she held was no ordinary weapon—it was a divine weapon nearly included in the replica of the White Jade Capital.

Not being able to see through him was indeed troublesome.

But for Yang Hua, it provided a clear reason to draw her sword.

Suddenly, a gust of mountain wind and water mist stirred between the two, and Wei Ban, dressed in white with gold earrings, appeared with a smile. "Saint Ruan is not here, but the rules remain. Please don’t make things difficult for me."

As soon as Wei Ban arrived, the dazzling aura of Yang Hua was immediately overshadowed.

Yang Hua kept her gaze fixed, her focus entirely on the young swordsman who had traveled for years, and said, "As long as we agree to a life-and-death pact, it is within the rules."

Chen Ping'an slowly replied, "Unfortunately, your master does not seem like someone who enjoys discussing rules."

A hint of anger finally surfaced on Yang Hua's face. "To disgrace the master is to bring death upon the servant. The goddess has spared my life and later even bestowed upon me the teachings of the Dao. Without her word, I would not have abandoned everything mundane, risking my life to become the river goddess of Iron Symbol River. Even though deep down, I have some words I wish to one day speak with her in person, how can an outsider dare to criticize her ways? A lowly wretch from Mud Bottle Alley suddenly becomes affluent, and yet their arrogance becomes lighter!"

Wei Ban appeared slightly surprised but quickly relaxed, leaning more towards being a rogue than a mediator. "As long as I’m here, neither of you will lay a hand on the other. If you both wish to turn this into a farce, swinging swords that miss their marks and providing others with a spectacle, then go ahead."

Chen Ping'an smiled at Wei Ban. "I never intended to discuss anything with her. Since that’s the case, I’ll take my leave first. Please escort me to Pei Qian."

Wei Ban nodded.

Yang Hua chimed in, "Chen Ping'an, why not directly trouble the River God Wei to take you to the Bamboo House at Ruined Mountain, hiding under the watchful gaze of an old martial arts master? Wouldn't that be more secure? I definitely wouldn't dare chase after you."

Chen Ping'an replied, "What? Don’t tell me you're actually interested in me? You must be trying to cling on."

Yang Hua’s expression turned frosty, a heavy aura of water surrounding her. As the river goddess, she was like Iron Symbol River’s depths, which had previously been silent and calm, now became turbulent, with faint thunder rumbling beneath the surface.

Wei Ban felt a headache coming on. Without a second thought, he quickly activated his divine powers to escort Chen Ping'an to Dragon Riding Alley.

Otherwise, it seemed that even the saint Ruan Qiong would not be able to stop these two stubborn individuals.

Yang Hua finally shifted her gaze slightly, focusing on the increasingly "transcendent" mountain deity standing before her, with eyes as cold as ice, showing no respect whatsoever.

Wei Ban chuckled wryly. "Neither of you is easy to deal with. Why am I here again, I wonder?"

Yang Hua directly asked, "Back then, when you rode past with Xu Ruo and the others, your gaze towards me was rather strange. What was that about?"

Wei Ban replied with a smile, "Don’t forget, although I was still a mere deity of Chess Pile Mountain back then, I had once been a proper mountain deity of a nation. Naturally, I could tell your golden body was of an exceptionally high rank, which was quite unusual, so I couldn’t help but steal a few glances."

Yang Hua shook her head. "You're lying."

Wei Ban didn’t linger on this topic, lightly chuckling. "Care to take a walk with me?"

He took the lead, walking a few steps before turning back. "In the world of the living, we need to abide by some rules, and us dead souls mingling in the incense need to adhere to them as well. Ruan Qiong isn’t here, so why would Chen Ping'an choose to abandon the more effortless method of sword flight and walk back to the small town instead?"

Yang Hua then began to follow, the two deities walking side by side along the calming banks of Iron Symbol River.

Wei Ban placed his hands behind his back and said slowly, "If I’m not mistaken, you stopped Chen Ping'an merely out of competitive spirit. At the core, you still can't let go of your identity as a swordsman in the mortal realm. Since your golden body is not yet stabilized and you’ve only just begun to consume the essence of incense, you’re still far from matching the likes of the water deities of Xiuhua, Yuyin, and Chongdan. Therefore, your provocation towards Chen Ping'an is actually quite straightforward—it’s a true sparring, not meant to suppress with realm. Given that, why can’t you simply have a decent conversation? Do you really think Chen Ping'an wouldn’t dare to kill you? Believe it or not, even if Chen Ping'an were to kill you, it would be for nothing. Perhaps the first to speak well of him would be that palace lady who wishes to mend the rift."

Yang Hua fell silent.

Mountains are higher than water—this is common knowledge in the world of righteousness.

The rank of deities of the Five Peaks is inherently above that of any water deity.

However, Yang Hua clearly held little respect for Wei Ban.

Wei Ban, unfazed, continued as if talking to himself, "How close is the distance between one thought and another? When you think of something here, someone far away may respond, transcending the realms of life and death. Yet sometimes, how far apart can two thoughts truly be?"

Yang Hua halted, scoffing, "I have no interest in your philosophical musings. As far as my responsibilities as the river goddess go, I won’t slack off at all. If you wish to show off the North Peak’s authority and try to suppress me and Iron Symbol River, feel free. I’ll gladly accept your challenge."

Wei Ban turned to smile. "It would be better to replace 'mood' with 'skill'—it sounds more subtle. What I mean is, this isn’t about being stubbornly disrespectful to your superior. If you want to shape your golden body and absorb the essence of incense, and if that falls on my ears, it merely indicates your naivety in worldly matters, which is somewhat excusable."

Yang Hua stopped. "Is your lecture over?"

Wei Ban nodded, his charming smile remaining. "We’ll end it here tonight, but I will seek you out for more heart-to-heart talks in the future."

Yang Hua’s expression darkened.

Wei Ban raised a finger to his lips. "Some hurtful words that are already on the tip of your tongue should go unsaid. Remember that."

Yang Hua, having served as a close attendant to the Great Li goddess, showed no signs of restraint and bluntly said, "Do you really not know what some of the high-ranking local deities of Great Li, including several old mountain deities and the ones near the capital, say about you behind your back? I never noticed before, but after seeing you tonight, you Wei Ban are indeed quite the opportunist..."

Wei Ban waved his hand dismissively. "Knowing what to say doesn’t mean I have to be defined by what others think of me. Do you really think I consider myself a saint with a heavenly mandate, or a celestial lord whose words can predict the future? Chen Ping'an just said you have feelings for him, which is why you’re so persistent. Is that the case?"

Wei Ban withdrew his hand. "Don’t try to provoke me this way, hoping we’ll go our separate ways and you can have peace. I won’t trouble you too often when I chat with you in the future, and I’ll be precise—never delaying your cultivation."

Yang Hua felt helpless, still harboring anger, and couldn’t help but sneer, "You’re so sycophantic towards Chen Ping'an—aren’t you ashamed? Do you know how many deities, both local and from vassal states, who know some truths, are secretly laughing at you because of the rumors they’ve heard?"

Wei Ban made a childish gesture, pressing his fingers to his cheeks and pulling up a smile. "As long as I see smiles when people look at me, that’s enough. As for what they say behind my back or think in their hearts, I have no interest in knowing."

Yang Hua pulled a lip, holding her sword and standing firmly, clearly unconvinced by Wei Ban’s nonsense.

Wei Ban sighed, "Though you faced some hardships in achieving your divine golden body, when you experience the ups and downs of life like I have, you’ll understand that the common sentiments of people are just that—common."

Wei Ban finally added, "The path is long, and cultivation is not easy. When encountering people and events, think carefully. In the end, the rise and fall of worldly matters still comes down to dealing with people."

Yang Hua remained sharp-tongued. "If you love speaking of grand principles, why don’t you go teach at Lin Deer Academy or Chen’s Academy as an instructor?"

Wei Ban tilted his head, smiling as he asked, "Is it that good principles are never really principles, and you can’t seem to listen?"

Yang Hua sensed trouble brewing.

Wei Ban raised both hands, lightly shaking his sleeves, which fluttered like two snowflakes. 

The essence of incense from the river goddess temple and the water essence from Iron Symbol River coalesced into two golden and emerald spheres, which Wei Ban tucked away.

He turned and left.

Yang Hua stood there, dazed. Was this what it meant for the North Peak deity to have a temper, to be so angered?

Unexpectedly, the white-clad deity didn’t stop, but turned his head with a smile to explain, "I’m not angry. To be honest, lying is petty."

Chen Ping'an gently knocked on the door of the auspicious shop at Dragon Riding Alley.

Since Wei Ban brought him here, it indicated that Pei Qian should be staying there for the night.

It wasn’t surprising; Pei Qian disliked dealing with Cui Cheng. In the sparsely populated Ruined Mountain, where could one find the vibrance of a small town? His own shop had pastries, and if he craved something sweet, it was only a few steps to buy some candied hawthorn. Chen Ping'an had never voiced any objections, as long as he kept his studies up and didn’t act too mischievous, he allowed Pei Qian to indulge. Moreover, Pei Qian did take care of the shop’s business. It was just uncertain what Pei Qian was thinking regarding her studies at the academy.

The door was opened by Shi Rou, a ghostly figure who didn’t entirely need sleep like the living. But unlike the living, she was active at night and would often only require a few hours of deep slumber. It was said that this was because the essence of ghostly beings was far more refined than that of the living, as the strong winds and sunlight on the earth were both suffering and a form of invisible cultivation.

Shi Rou smiled. "Young master, you’re back!"

Chen Ping'an nodded. "Is Pei Qian sleeping here?"

Shi Rou softly replied, "She finished copying her books with Miss Li from Fulu Street, turned off the lights, and chatted for quite a while before falling asleep. A few days ago, she went to Chess Pile Mountain and got stung badly by a wasp. Even after getting herbal medicine from the Yang family shop, she still finds it hard to sleep."

As they closed the shop door, Shi Rou asked, "Shall I wake them up?"

Shi Rou hesitated; although the back courtyard of the auspicious shop had three rooms, the main room was occupied by Pei Qian and Li Baoping. One side room was filled with goods, leaving only one room, which was technically Shi Rou’s personal space, cluttered with personal items bought from the marketplace—things that couldn’t be shown to others. Currently, residing within the shell of a male immortal, she even found it awkward to have a dressing table set up there, especially since Pei Qian had deliberately gifted her a bronze mirror as a present.

Chen Ping'an lowered his voice, "No need. I’ll sit in the courtyard for a night, think of it as practicing my stance. Later, you can tell me about the recent happenings in Longquan County."

Under the eaves of Shi Rou's side room, they sat one on the bench and stood one by it. Shi Rou brought over a long stool for Chen Ping'an. Though there were chairs, she chose not to sit.

Shi Rou shared a few matters about the night feast and various happenings at Ruined Mountain.

The students from Mountain Cliff Academy continued their journey northward, first visiting the old site of the academy in the Great Li capital, then moving further north to the seaside of Baoping Continent. However, Li Baoping had convinced the academy’s saint, Mao Xiaodong, to remain in the small town for some reason. Shi Rou suspected it was due to Li’s ancestors requesting a favor from Master Mao.

Liu Qingshan and Liu Boqi had already departed Longquan County. Before leaving, this couple, who had traveled half the continent together, specifically sought out Zhu Lian for a drink and made a formal pledge.

Upon hearing this, Chen Ping'an paused, surprised. Liu Qingshan didn’t seem like the type to be involved in such trivialities, unlike his own first disciple.

Shi Rou smiled, revealing the answer: Liu Boqi had recognized Zhu Lian as an older brother, insisting that Zhu Lian make a trip to Qingluan Country to attend her and Liu Qingshan's wedding.

Chen Ping'an rubbed his forehead, baffled. What on earth was happening?

There were also a few notable matters, but Shi Rou didn’t elaborate much, hoping that Chen Ping'an could chat casually with Zhu Lian. She had to admit that Zhu Lian was steady in his dealings, whether big or small. It was just that his incessant chatter could be annoying, and his gaze made her, as a female ghost, feel uneasy.

One matter was regarding Liu Chongrun from Zijiang Lake, who had not personally come but sent a trusted disciple with gifts to visit Ruined Mountain. At that time, Wei Ban even took the initiative to meet her, which left the young lady, not even at the Cave Mansion stage, quite scared, resulting in her speech being somewhat disjointed.

Another was regarding the water gods of Huangting Kingdom, who had visited Ruined Mountain one after another, with Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafu responsible for receiving them.

After listening to Shi Rou's orderly recounting of the various events, Chen Ping'an pointed towards the main room and asked with a smile, "How are those two doing?"

Shi Rou was taken aback, replying helplessly, "It’s one thing for Pei Qian to be mischievous, but I never expected Miss Li to let Pei Qian run wild too. You wouldn’t believe it, but seeing the two of them looking so pitiful in the shop made me feel almost the same as that girl from Zizhai Island. However, they seem to be quite happy. They even made plans to hone their martial arts skills and explore dangerous places once they learn enough."

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but chuckle.

For some reason, Shi Rou seemed more relaxed after settling at the shop than she did back at Ruined Mountain, even teasing Chen Ping'an, "Young master, did you bring gifts for someone again on this trip?"

Chen Ping'an acknowledged her with a "Hmm," flipping his wrist to reveal three small items he had purchased at the ferry of Dilong Mountain, handing over a shallow bowl made of red material and a tile inkstone, while he kept a pair of engraved seals from a renowned engraver in a southeastern country, lightly tapping one against his ear to listen to the crisp sound. He tilted his head and smiled, "Three items, costing twelve snowflower coins. If you like any, choose one, and later I’ll tell Pei Qian that I only bought two."

Shi Rou glanced at the cute and friendly red bowl a few more times but still shook her head. "Forget it."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Gifts are usually given in pairs, odd numbers are bad luck. I’m about to leave for a long journey and won’t be back anytime soon; consider it a red envelope for the Spring Festival next year."

Shi Rou gently raised the red bowl in her palm. "Then I’ll take this one?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, reminding her, "Just don’t let it slip. The little girl loves to keep accounts, and she won’t dare to nag me in front of you, but you’ll inevitably have to listen to her for years."

Shi Rou tucked away the small bowl and returned the "Eternal Happiness" tile inkstone to Chen Ping'an.

Shi Rou asked curiously, "Do you really enjoy giving gifts?"

Chen Ping'an smiled. "You might not understand, but I’ve always loved making and saving money since I was young. Back then, I worked hard to save copper coins, and sometimes when I couldn’t sleep at night, I’d take out a small ceramic jar, gently shake it, and listen to the sound of the coins clinking. You’ve probably never heard that before, have you? Later, when Zheng Dafu was overseeing the gate on the east side of the town, I made a deal with him; for every letter I delivered to the townsfolk, I earned a copper coin. Each time I went to him for a letter, I wished he’d just throw me a whole basket of coins. But in the end, I didn’t earn much. Then, due to some incidents, I left my hometown."

Shi Rou shook her head with a smile.

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands within his sleeves, leaning forward. "It’s not that I’ve become extravagant just because I have money now. It’s rather that the reason I was so obsessed with wealth back then was to ensure that one day I wouldn’t need to be stingy over small matters. For instance, when it came to purchasing items for my parents’ graves, I could buy better offerings. During the New Year, I wouldn’t be unable to afford spring couplets, having to only gaze longingly at the couplets hanging at the entrance of the neighboring yard, as if I had them too. That feeling of being used to such embarrassment and finding joy in suffering might seem childish to anyone who sees it."

Shi Rou didn’t know how to respond.

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping'an continued, "Some words might seem a bit dark, but since I’m about to leave Longquan County, just consider this a prelude to listening for a bit. After hearing it, I probably won’t bother you for at least three years."

Shi Rou smiled. "Please, young master."

Chen Ping'an pointed at Shi Rou, "In this guise of an immortal, I never thought you’d gain much. But the fortune of the world doesn’t linger past your doorstep. After accepting this opportunity, you must first clear your mind of discontent. Knowing how to handle it well is a skill. Of course, whether you believe it or not, and whether you think I'm just speaking empty words, I must say that I don’t expect you, Shi Rou, to do anything for Ruined Mountain because of this guise. I just hope that wherever you are, whether at Ruined Mountain or in this small shop in Dragon Riding Alley, you can blend in. Don’t always think that it’s others’ faults that you feel out of place. You need to learn to adapt to local customs. Of course, this isn’t easy; it requires patience akin to water dripping through stone. But that’s how we live, isn’t it?"

Shi Rou pondered for a while. "Young master, your words are sincere and meaningful. I will think more on them."

Chen Ping'an set aside the seals and tile inkstone, uncapping the sword nurturing gourd to sip some wine. "Have you noticed how, at Ruined Mountain or the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, there are so many people whose ranks and realms vary, but relationships are not determined by that? When I share these thoughts with you, it’s not that I want you to become the person I envision, but I don't want you to feel wronged. The feeling of grievance is real, but it can lead you to misunderstandings of the truth."

Shi Rou asked, "Chen Ping'an, when more people gather at Ruined Mountain in the future, will you still share your heart so openly with everyone?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "If I really have my own sect on the mountain one day, with dozens or hundreds of people, I won’t be able to manage them all. But that’s fine; I have you all here. I’ve always believed that principles don’t always have to be spoken. If one stands upright and maintains a good mindset, you, Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafu, and the others all have your strengths, and naturally, there will be principles."

Chen Ping'an suddenly raised his arm and extended his hand. "Just like the spring breeze sneaking into the night, nourishing everything quietly, it’s better than me, a person who isn’t even a scholar, rambling on and on."

Shi Rou gazed at the young man’s profile, lost in thought.

Afterward, Chen Ping'an began practicing his stance with the sword furnace, while Shi Rou returned to her room.

Wei Ban appeared beneath the eaves, smiling. "You go ahead; I can wait."

Half an hour later, Chen Ping'an finally opened his eyes, sighed, "Thanks for waiting."

Wei Ban asked, "What’s going on?"

Chen Ping'an replied helplessly, "Actually, when I ascended to Gong Liu Island years ago and met that fifth realm cultivator Liu Cheng, I heard him recount his experiences with inner demons. I realized my own state of mind had indeed been elevating too quickly. Later, Elder Cui also told me that during that heart-testing event at Zijiang Lake, I should have been at the level of a Golden Core cultivator or even a Nascent Soul cultivator, which would have warranted the heart-searching trials I faced. The biggest trouble stems from the fact that after my original porcelain shattered, my state of mind also fell apart. After several journeys, what I’ve seen, learned, and understood, while piecing it together, still falls short of reconstructing a long-lasting bridge that can withstand the winds and rains. As a result, at Qingxia Island, I shattered my writing brush, compounding my issues. Though I finally managed to convince myself at Zijiang Lake, the process of convincing myself also bore many burdens. The crux of the problem lies in the fundamental conflict between reality and reason; this has nothing to do with Zijiang Lake; it’s merely my own issue."

Chen Ping'an took a sip of wine, genuinely using it to drown his sorrows. "I once firmly believed that the more principles I understood, the faster I would be when punching and drawing my sword—faster and faster."

He murmured, "But as I’ve come to understand the complexity of this world and the difficulty in discerning the goodness and evil of human hearts, I hope that before I act, I must observe the opponent's threads, or several threads, and consider as many possibilities as possible—the best and the worst—then use my swordsmanship to delineate and define, only then can I achieve the speed I consider ‘flawless.’ When I act, it should be fast."

Chen Ping'an muttered to himself, "But once something happens suddenly, and I must immediately distinguish right from wrong, life from death, I can’t take the time to slowly delve into human hearts and truths—what then?"

Wei Ban nodded. "The deeper the truth in the world, the heavier it becomes. As a pure martial artist, you are tying yourself up. Because you clearly know, deep down, you... are not satisfied. Remembering back to when you, Chen Ping'an, were at your most impoverished, your state of mind was the lightest, because at that time, you were absolutely certain that the principles you had to adhere to were just a few. So you could endure; if you couldn’t endure, then fight with all your might. Thus, whether facing Cai Jinjian or Fu Nanhua, or later against the Mounshan Ape from Zhengyang Mountain and Ma Kuxuan from Xinghua Alley, your martial intent was as heavy as it was light. You just needed to present it without guilt, with pure martial intent, treating life and death lightly, and strike first."

Chen Ping'an solemnly replied, "Exactly!"

Wei Ban leaned against a pillar, "So you need to take a trip to North Julu Continent, hoping for freedom. You wish for those sword cultivators and martial artists there to truly not care for principles and act brazenly. This is the method you’ve come to understand since leaving Zijiang Lake. But when you leave Ruined Mountain, revisit old places, and meet old friends with a different perspective of the world, you’ll find that you yourself have wavered. You’ll realize that even in North Julu Continent, things would still be muddled, because ultimately, people are still people, and they all have their own joys and sorrows. The pitiful will have their hateful aspects, and the hateful will also have their pitiable aspects. No matter how vast the world, the heart of man remains unchanged."

Chen Ping'an fell silent, taking another swig of wine.

Wei Ban gently stated, "It seems yet another conundrum without a solution. Either become another Chen Ping'an or just stagger forward, practicing your punches and swordplay. Even if you rise through the realms, you’ll never be able to achieve the speed you envision."

Wei Ban switched the topic. "Does it not suddenly feel like no matter how far you go or how much you see, this world seems to have something amiss, yet you can’t quite put your finger on it? You can only bottle it up, and this somewhat vague doubt seems impervious to alcohol, even impossible to discuss with others."

Chen Ping'an’s eyes widened; Wei Ban’s words struck home!

Wei Ban remained in his languid posture, gazing at the bright moon. "In a person’s heart, there must be both sun and moon."

Wei Ban squinted, smiling. "Neither can be absent."

Chen Ping'an fell into deep thought.

Wei Ban turned back, smiling. "Since the general direction is right, it’s only a matter of endurance. What’s to be afraid of? Chen Ping'an, do you fear hardship? Are you not better off now than when you had nothing? It seems that once life suddenly showed hope, you’ve begun to feel the burdens of a strong person? You might as well examine yourself with the simplest methods. First, reasoning is never a bad thing. It’s even rarer to discuss principles well. Second, if you currently feel that principles are hindering your punches and swordplay, don’t doubt that your ‘first’ is wrong; it merely indicates that you haven’t done enough, that your understanding of principles isn’t deep enough, and that your current punches and swordplay are still not fast enough."

Chen Ping'an’s gaze brightened a bit, but he wryly smiled. "Easier said than done."

Wei Ban spread his hands. "That’s your problem, not mine."

Chen Ping'an felt relieved and smiled. "Hearing your words is better than reading ten years of books."

Wei Ban clicked his tongue. "No wonder you’re the lord of Ma Pi Mountain."

Chen Ping'an laughed heartily. "Do you see Ruined Mountain that way as well?"

Chen Ping'an quickly suppressed his laughter to avoid disturbing the main room.

Wei Ban suddenly said, "Regarding Gu Can’s father being promoted, the Great Li court is actually in quite a stir. It’s a minor position, but the Ministry of Rites initially wanted to promote this spirit governor to the position of city god, but the two lords Yuan and Cao wouldn’t agree. Thus, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Revenue teamed up for the first time to counter the Ministry of Rites. Now, however, there have been changes, and Lord Gu’s Ministry of Personnel has also thrown themselves into the fray. Who would have thought that a few small city gods could involve such a large political storm, with all sides eager to participate? Clearly, no one wants that vassal king and National Teacher Cui Chan, and at most the palace lady, to settle this matter amongst themselves."

Chen Ping'an tentatively asked, "Is it for that vacant position?"

Wei Ban nodded. "It has indeed dragged on for too long and is not in compliance with the rites. Because of this, the three Great Li iron cavalry units in the central part of Baoping Continent are starting to feel restless."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I don’t care about these things."

Wei Ban smiled. "Sharing this with you is just to let you know that every family has its troubles, and it’s not just you, Chen Ping'an, who is struggling."

Chen Ping'an retorted, "Don’t talk as if you’re not in pain standing there."

Wei Ban glanced at Chen Ping'an. "You, sitting there, have the audacity to tell me, standing?"

Wei Ban stood up straight. "Alright, let’s leave it at that. You don’t have to worry about Iron Symbol River; I will handle her."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

He suddenly recalled the divine water ink made from pine soot produced by the state at the ferry of Dilong Mountain.

Wei Ban laughed. "If it’s priced at five small summer coins, it’s a bargain. Qinghua Workshop is indeed short-sighted and unknowledgeable. But they can’t be blamed; the charm of this item is something that very few know about. I’ll have someone rush to Qinghua Workshop right away."

Chen Ping'an replied, "The round trip will incur some expenses, and this divine money should be accounted for."

Wei Ban chuckled, asking, "What does that have to do with me? I don’t need to pay. Guess how many people in the North Peak region would be willing to run this trip for me, wasting money—dozens? Hundreds? Conversely, spending five or even ten small summer coins, by giving out this favor, is like giving them a peace of mind; they’re all guaranteed to make a huge profit."

At this moment, Chen Ping'an naturally understood everything.

Wei Ban vanished in a flash, reminding Chen Ping'an before leaving that the intercontinental ferry would be arriving soon, so he shouldn’t miss the timing.

Arriving at the magnificent mountain temple atop Cloud-Dispelling Mountain, Wei Ban lay on the eaves, using the sky as a blanket, and fell asleep.

The great rivers and lakes all converged, the winding waterways curved, and the lofty mountains embraced one another, with a thousand-mile dragon residing.

The depths were rich with fish, and the forests were home to birds. The mountains were clear, the waters beautiful, and the land gave birth to outstanding people.

As dawn broke.

Pei Qian, rubbing her sleepy eyes, pushed open the door, holding a hiking staff, and swaggered across the threshold, looking up at the sky, boldly exclaiming, "Heaven, I bet you, if I don’t practice some peerless swordsmanship today, my master will appear right before me! What do you say? Dare to bet?"

Pei Qian nodded to herself. "Not talking? Then that’s a yes! If I lose the bet, then I can’t be blamed on a bad heaven!"

Pei Qian bounced into the courtyard, only to freeze in place.

Under the eaves of Shi Rou's side room, her master seemed to be sitting there watching her?

Chen Ping'an, looking at the darkened face that resembled a swollen bun, realized that it had indeed been slightly reduced from applying medicine. One could only imagine how pitiful he had looked returning from Chess Pile Mountain.

Pei Qian rubbed her eyes. "Master? Am I dreaming?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Then give yourself a slap."

Pei Qian blinked, letting out a chuckle, "I’m not stupid."

She turned and shouted toward the main room, "Sister Baoping, my master is here!"

A tall young woman in red quickly stepped out, her face even more swollen than Pei Qian’s, so at first glance, she didn’t seem as beautiful.

Moreover, she showed no signs of being shy about her appearance, flinging her arms wide, she dashed over to Chen Ping'an and suddenly stopped, beaming, "Little Uncle!"

Chen Ping'an stood before the two peers, extending both hands to measure their heights.

Pei Qian pouted.

What’s with Sister Baoping and Master looking like this too?

Chen Ping'an, upon first seeing Little Baoping, felt a twinge of disbelief.

That little girl in a red cotton jacket had somehow grown so tall in the blink of an eye?

Shi Rou brought out two chairs. Pei Qian wanted to sit on the long bench with her master but glanced at the already seated Li Baoping, and immediately shifted to sit next to her.

Chen Ping'an, watching the two girls' swollen faces, struggled to suppress his laughter. "Have Li Huai and the others set out with Master Mao to the north?"

Li Baoping nodded vigorously. "My grandfather will personally lead me to catch up with the main group. Little Uncle, you don’t need to worry."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Have you seen Dong Shuijing?"

Li Baoping smiled. "Pei Qian and I went to Fengliang Mountain. The wontons in the shop were fine, but not as good as Little Uncle’s cooking."

Pei Qian wore a sullen look, remaining motionless.

That little dark girl had her doubts, remembering how Baoping had devoured two large bowls of wontons at Dong Shuijing’s shop.

But how could she dare say that in front of Baoping? What if Baoping thought she was too talkative and refused to take her out to play in the future?

Chen Ping'an reminded her, "When passing through the capital, make sure to find Shi Chunji."

Li Baoping affirmed, "I’ve already sent a letter. The girl with the goat horns is waiting for me."

Then Chen Ping'an turned his attention to Pei Qian. "Have you thought about whether you want to go to the academy to study?"

Pei Qian lowered her head. "I’ve made up my mind. Sister Baoping wants me to go to the academy, and she dragged me there for several days, saying it’s to investigate the situation. To know oneself and one’s enemy, I need to understand the temperament of every teacher beforehand, so I can avoid getting hit and punished for copying texts. Sister Baoping even forbade me from bragging about my book box or sticking talismans on my forehead when I go to school. There are many, many rules that Sister Baoping wrote down for me, and I have to copy them every day."

Li Baoping patted Pei Qian’s head. "This is called making the difficult easy. When you reach the academy, don’t fear the teachers. If you have questions, just ask them. And if you face bullying among your classmates, don’t just cry and complain to Sister Shi Rou, you must learn to resolve it with your own abilities. What’s most important when you get to the academy is what? What is it?"

Pei Qian replied in a low voice, "It’s learning the principles of being a person from the teachers. The specific content in the books is merely skills, not the Dao. Both are best; if you can’t achieve both, you must choose the Dao and discard the skills—never pick sesame seeds while discarding watermelons."

Only then did Li Baoping nod in satisfaction.

Pei Qian looked up, a pitiful expression on her face as she gazed at Chen Ping'an, "Master."

Li Baoping pressed down on Pei Qian’s head, and Pei Qian quickly forced a smile, "Sister Baoping, I understand! I have a good memory!"

Chen Ping'an took out the tile inkstone and seals, handing them to Pei Qian, and said, "These are gifts I bought for you on the way. As for Baoping, I didn’t find anything suitable, so let Little Uncle owe you first."

Pei Qian was overjoyed, hesitating for a moment while holding the inkstone in one hand and the seals in the other, turning to Li Baoping and asking, "Sister Baoping, which one do you want? I’ll give it to you!"

Li Baoping shook her head. "No need, I just love reading some travelogues."

Pei Qian let out an "Oh," feeling somewhat disappointed.

Chen Ping'an suddenly pulled out a stack of ancient books, handing them to Li Baoping. "I picked these up from the water-view street in Red Candle Town. They’re not expensive; don’t despise them."

Li Baoping beamed, holding them close, grinning widely. "Little Uncle, you’re lying."

She smiled so broadly that it was quite unbecoming.

Almost reminiscent of her childhood.

Chen Ping'an began to adopt the demeanor of master and little uncle, saying, "In the future, it’s not that I won’t let you poke the hornet’s nest, but you must always consider the escape routes beforehand. If it comes down to it, you should also carry some herbs with you."

Li Baoping crossed her arms, nodding earnestly.

Pei Qian sighed, poking the ground with her hiking staff. "It’s all my fault; my crazy sword technique still lacks power."

Shi Rou had already opened the shop to welcome customers. Upon entering the courtyard, she noticed Chen Ping'an nodding, signaling that he understood.

Shi Rou took it all in stride.

Her young master was adept at revealing character and skill in subtleties; his mind was as vast as mountains and rivers, yet his vision was as fine as a mustard seed.

This was Zhu Lian’s flattery.

Shi Rou felt it wasn’t entirely flattery.

Chen Ping'an stood up and said, "Baoping, your grandfather has arrived."

Li Baoping stood up, bouncing slightly. "Little Uncle, when we meet next, I’ll be this tall."

Pei Qian’s mouth fell open; this was a topic she couldn’t interject into, so she wisely chose to keep silent to avoid humiliation.

Chen Ping'an produced the clay figurine of the Mili Mud Woman and smiled. "This is for Li Huai."

Li Baoping carefully tucked it away.

Chen Ping'an led them to the shop entrance, where they met the venerable Li family elder, a Nascent Soul earth deity, and Chen Ping'an clasped his fist in greeting. "Greetings, Grandfather Li."

The old man nodded with a smile, expressing his satisfaction. "Very good, very good. You’ve made progress. Otherwise, others would think our Li Zhu Cave Heaven only produced someone as unrefined as that Ma Kuxian, and wouldn’t that be a joke!"

Chen Ping'an hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back.

The old man shook his head. "No need to rush; take it slow. There are distinctions in family gates, but when it comes to family values, it’s only about righteousness, not about the size of the gate. Our two families’ values are both commendable. Since that’s the case, let us both conduct our affairs as we see fit. If there’s anything we need from each other in the future, feel free to ask."

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement; this was best for both sides.

Li Baoping left with her grandfather, but she walked backward, waving goodbye.

Chen Ping'an smiled and gently waved back.

Pei Qian suddenly exclaimed, feeling rather sentimental, "The moon waxes and wanes, and people come together and part ways. It really makes one anxious!"

Chen Ping'an gave her a playful slap on the head.

This time, there was no room for anxiety; Pei Qian grimaced and cried out in pain.

As Chen Ping'an led Pei Qian toward Ruined Mountain, Pei Qian, with her sword and hiking staff, ran around her master, recounting her recent feats, of course, excluding the incident with the hornet’s nest, which had been a careless mistake.

At Ruined Mountain, Zhu Lian was painting a portrait of a beautiful woman, inspired by a small deity he had caught a glimpse of during a night feast.

Beside him, Zheng Dafu wore a strange smile.

The young girl Zhu Lian had brought up the mountain felt that Zhu Lian was indeed knowledgeable in all matters, and she looked at him with increasing admiration.

In the southern border of Huangting Kingdom, a tall man dressed in white, graceful and dashing, with a narrow knife at his waist, walked behind a pair of twelve- or thirteen-year-old twins. They shared strikingly similar features, but the sister had a fierce gaze, her entire being exuding sharpness as she slung a self-made wooden spear over her back. The brother seemed more like a gentle scholar, carrying a book box and a water flask.

These siblings were disciples the man had taken in during his travels, both possessing remarkable martial talent.

In Tongye Continent.

At Yuguizong.

On a secluded mountain peak not yet "opened," rising into the clouds, an exceptionally beautiful woman stood with her long sword, gazing at the sea of clouds.

On a nearby peak, within a misty celestial mansion, a handsome young man donned a tall crown. He held a distinguished position within Yuguizong, currently leaning against the railing, gazing longingly at the woman, convinced that she was destined to be his life companion.

In the central part of Baoping Continent, a rural path leading to the Water-view Academy.

A robust man walked behind a yellow ox, somewhat missing that quirky little dark girl. 

That yellow ox, with long water buffalo-like horns, had a scroll of writings hanging from one horn, while on the other side, a white-clad young man, with a beauty mark on his forehead and a demeanor akin to an ethereal being, clung to the ox's horn, looking utterly bored as he lamented, "Wei Xian, I miss the master so much! What should I do? Just thinking that the master isn’t here to serve me makes me feel anxious..."

Wei Xian remained silent.

He had grown accustomed to this—every few days, this guy liked to create such a scene. Even if Wei Xian admired and respected him, he still found it irritating.

Along this journey, aside from serious matters, during idle moments, this fellow would love to find trouble. His bloody hands were one thing; his manipulation of human hearts made even Wei Xian feel a chill down his spine. However, some of the things he said caused Wei Xian a headache, like earlier when they passed by a well-hidden ghostly sect, this fellow toyed with a group of evil cultivators, leading them around in circles while pretending to be on the brink of death. He had nearly ruined an entire sect.

After taking over their territory, he temporarily acted as a local tyrant, throwing a lavish banquet and inviting various heroes. During the feast, he began to boast, and once his master was mentioned, the crowd, having survived the ordeal, was left clueless on how to flatter him, resulting in an awkward silence. Eventually, he casually slapped two of them to death. "To be honest, if I accidentally anger my master, I could easily finish him off in less than half a stick of incense. It’s no exaggeration!"

"As autumn approaches and winter comes, Kui pities the snakes, the snakes pity the winds, and the winds pity the eyes. Oh, master, have some pity on your student..."

The young man still clung to the ox horn, kicking his legs about, continuously wailing, startling countless birds in the forest.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 550: The Call of the Partridge in the Mountains

In the past, the great western mountains were sparsely populated, with only woodcutters and charcoal burners wandering among them. Today, however, these peaks are dotted with the magnificent abodes of immortal cultivators. Chen Ping’an has seen local children from the nearby town more than once, sitting on the walls with their bowls of rice, eagerly waiting for the ferryboat to pass. Whenever they caught a glimpse of it, they would shout and leap with joy.

On this return journey to the Ruined Mountain, Chen Ping’an and Pei Qian encountered a convoy of immortal masters heading to the Belt Peak (Yidai Feng).

Staying here to establish a cave dwelling was somewhat inconvenient because Ruan Qiong had set a rule prohibiting any cultivator from carelessly riding the winds and traveling far. However, as time passed and Ruan Qiong established the Longquan Sword Sect, he was no longer just a recluse sage but a sect master who needed to expand his influence and foster relationships. He gradually began to relax the restrictions, allowing the Golden Core Earth Immortal disciple Dong Gu to select a few routes for riding the winds and crossing the void. With that, they would request a few small iron sword-style "pass" tokens from the Longquan Sword Sect, granting them a bit more freedom to enter and exit the Lijuzhu blessed land. So far, however, only a handful of immortal forces remaining in Longquan County had managed to obtain that petite iron sword. It wasn’t that the Longquan Sword Sect was overly proud; rather, the swordsmith was not Ruan Qiong or his few direct disciples but Ruan Qiong's only daughter, the slow and meticulous girl, who could barely forge a single sword in a year. Who would dare to rush her? Even if someone had the nerve, they might not have the guts. 

Rumor had it that a few years back, a team of elite officials from the Ministry of Rites, led by the department head, went south to the Book Lake to "settle matters." With almost single-handed effort, the girl managed to smooth everything over.

The immortal sect that once chose the Belt Peak for its location, with its ancestral hall situated in Yunxia Mountain in the Dreamliang Kingdom, was a second-rate force, barely scraping by on the continent of Baoping. When the cavalry of the Great Li Dynasty found themselves in a precarious situation, it wasn’t that this sect did not want to relocate; rather, they were reluctant to abandon the divine funds used to establish their residence, unwilling to let it go to waste. Moreover, one of the old masters in their ancestral hall, as one of the last remaining Golden Core Earth Immortals on the mountain, still resided at Belt Peak to practice, accompanied by a dozen disciples and some servants. This old cultivator had a strained relationship with the mountain master, and the sect’s move was essentially an attempt to send this stubborn master away, sparing the younger generation from his daily antics of throwing tantrums and glaring at them.

Chen Ping’an was not in a hurry, and although the horse-drawn carriage moved slowly, they stepped aside to let it pass. Unexpectedly, the convoy also came to a halt.

The convoy consisted of two carriages and more than twenty people, but only three were true immortal masters from the Belt Peak, while the rest were mere attendants and helpers.

A young cultivator and two beautiful female cultivators stepped down from one of the carriages. One of the female cultivators cradled a lazy, curled-up young white fox.

The young cultivator was one of the direct disciples of the old master at Belt Peak. He approached Chen Ping’an with a smile, saying, “Mountain Master Chen, I am Song Yuan from the Belt Peak. My master once took me to visit the Ruined Mountain, but I stood at the back, so you might not remember me.”

His words were smooth and graceful, very pleasant to hear.

In truth, Chen Ping’an recognized Song Yuan. He had a good memory and was never one to look down on others. He could easily recall the time when the Earth Immortals from the Belt Peak visited Ruined Mountain; Song Yuan had not stood at the back but had been right next to his master, as the favored disciple. After all, the emperor favors his beloved children.

Chen Ping’an cupped his hands in a greeting and smiled, asking, “Has Young Immortal Song returned from afar?”

Song Yuan was somewhat surprised; there was another master at the Belt Peak who also bore the surname Song. Hence, when this mountain master addressed him as “Young Immortal Song,” it carried a certain significance.

Song Yuan nodded, saying, “I just returned from Yunxia Mountain, where I attended a ceremony. A friend who was also present there heard that our Lijuzhu blessed land is one of the few places of exceptional spirit and beauty on the continent, so they wanted to travel through our Longquan County and returned with me and Junior Sister Liu.”

Song Yuan took a couple of steps back, extending his hand towards the two young female cultivators. “Allow me to introduce you to Mountain Master Chen. This is Junior Sister Liu, my master’s most cherished granddaughter; you can call her Run Yun. This is Miss Zhou from the Qingmei Temple at Nantang Lake, who is Junior Sister Liu's closest friend. We just came from the Chen Family Academy and planned to visit the Piyun Mountain Forest Deer Academy before heading back to Belt Peak.”

Chen Ping’an greeted both Liu and Zhou warmly before saying with a smile, “Then I won’t delay Young Immortal Song’s journey any further.”

Song Yuan smiled and nodded, not engaging in any forced pleasantries. The cultivators on the mountain typically preferred to maintain a clear and focused mind, avoiding too much entanglement in worldly affairs. Since Chen Ping'an did not extend an invitation to visit Ruined Mountain, Song Yuan refrained from mentioning it, even though he noticed Zhou had subtly signaled him to invite Chen Ping’an. 

Throughout their travels to the north, Zhou had benefited greatly from the “Mirror Flower, Water Moon” affair at Nantang Lake and was determined not to miss any networking opportunities or picturesque landscapes. Almost every time they visited an immortal's residence or a beautiful scenic area, Zhou would utilize the Qingmei Temple's secret technique to “capture” scenes, embedding her charming figure within. During festivals, she would send these to wealthy acquaintances who could afford to spend lavishly on her. Accompanying her, Song Yuan felt somewhat disheartened; however, Zhou and Liu had a long-standing friendship, and knowing how much Liu longed for Belt Peak to open up the restrictions on the “Mirror Flower, Water Moon,” he decided to hold his tongue. His master was very fond of this granddaughter, but he was adamant about not allowing her to become a showy figure, flaunting her appearance among a group of lecherous suitors. After all, Belt Peak wasn’t lacking in divine funds, and he absolutely forbade it.

Zhou, not wishing to let Chen Ping’an leave, tousled her hair and spoke, “Mountain Master Chen, I’ve heard many stories about you from Song Shixiong. He holds you in high regard and mentioned that you are now one of the leading landlords in Lijuzhu blessed land. I wonder if my visit with Run Yun to Ruined Mountain would be unwelcome?”

Song Yuan felt a chill run down his spine, and he forced a smile.

He had told Zhou multiple times that the Lijuzhu blessed land was not like other immortal cultivation territories; the situation was complex, with entangled relationships and numerous divine beings. She should be cautious in her words and actions. Yet, it seemed Zhou had not heeded his advice, and perhaps her spirit was even more ignited by it. But Zhou, oh Zhou, the Great Li Longquan County is not as simple as you think.

Chen Ping’an smiled slightly at Song Yuan, signaling him not to think too much, then turned to Zhou and said, “Unfortunately, I will be leaving the mountain soon, so I may disappoint Miss Zhou. Next time I return to Ruined Mountain, I will definitely invite you and Junior Sister Liu to visit.”

Liu Run Yun opened her mouth to speak, but Song Yuan discreetly tugged on her sleeve.

Zhou bit her lip in disappointment. “Oh, is that so? Then I wonder when Mountain Master Chen will return home, so I can prepare in advance.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head with a smile, “It’s hard to say for now.”

The graceful Zhou, making a slight bow, straightened up and shyly said, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mountain Master Chen. You are welcome to visit the Qingmei Temple at Nantang Lake next time. Qiong Lin will personally take you to admire the plum blossoms. Our Qingmei Temple's ‘Caotang Plum Grove in Spring’ is famous and will surely not disappoint you.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Alright, if I have the opportunity to pass by, I will trouble you to host me at the Qingmei Temple.”

Zhou Qiong Lin noticed the young girl with the walking staff and smiled, “Hello, little girl!”

Pei Qian pointed to her still swollen face, looking silly, and replied, “I’m not so good.”

Zhou Qiong Lin wanted to try and smooth things over with the seemingly unlikable girl, but Chen Ping’an had already taken Pei Qian’s hand and bade farewell.

Liu Run Yun seemed to want to stand up for Zhou, but Song Yuan did not let go; instead, he directly grasped her wrist. Liu Run Yun, who felt a slight pain, was surprised but remained silent.

Although she had grown up sheltered under her grandfather’s protection and was carefree, Liu Run Yun was still a serious immortal master in her own right. Although she had yet to reach the cave dwelling stage, she was certainly not foolish.

The convoy slowly passed, and after a distance, the coachman, who had received prior instructions, finally dared to speed up.

As the carriage curtain was lifted, Zhou Qiong Lin looked at the pair walking along the roadside, feeling somewhat helpless as the two simply focused on their path, leaving her with the impression of being a charming yet hopelessly romantic figure who had met a blind person.

Song Yuan sat alone in the front carriage, sighing heavily.

This Zhou was truly a troublesome character. Once they returned to Belt Peak, he would need to speak with his master privately to keep Liu from being led astray.

On the road, Pei Qian practiced a set of frantic sword techniques before cheerfully asking, “Master, guess which one of the three I like the most?”

Chen Ping’an casually replied, “Liu Run Yun from Belt Peak?”

Pei Qian shook her head, “Try again, Master.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Is it Song Yuan, who is just like me?”

To his surprise, Pei Qian shook her head once more, “Guess again!”

Chen Ping’an was puzzled, “Then is it Zhou Qiong Lin?”

Regarding Zhou, who was adept at currying favor, Chen Ping’an felt neither aversion nor fondness. His main concern was her manner of building connections, which was too inappropriate and could easily land Song Yuan in trouble. If she were to garner ill feelings, Zhou could return to Nantang Lake and continue her life as a celestial maiden. But for Song Yuan, who was a half-friend, and for the Belt Peak, it would be a different story. This was the key reason why Chen Ping’an was unwilling to give Zhou even a hint of favor.

Pei Qian raised a hand, gently shaking it, signaling she wanted to whisper something to her master.

Chen Ping’an bent down with a smile, and Pei Qian covered her mouth with one hand, whispering, “That Zhou, although she looks all seductive, of course, she’s definitely not as pretty as Sister Nü Guan or Yao Jin Zhi. But, Master, I see that in her heart, there are many pitiful little people dressed in rags, just like I was back then, all skinny and nearly starving. And she, well, she feels very sad, unable to look at them due to a big empty bowl.”

Chen Ping’an’s heart trembled, and he suddenly looked up, realizing the convoy had already passed. He murmured the words that the previous celestial maiden had said: “I see.”

Chen Ping’an walked slowly.

Pei Qian waved her walking staff, puzzled, and looked up, “Master, aren’t you happy? Did I say something wrong?”

Pei Qian thought for a moment and quickly came up with a remedy. She opened her mouth wide and shook her head, pretending to eat her words, “Okay, Master, I’ve swallowed all my words back! Now you can cheer up!”

Chen Ping’an smiled brightly, gently pressing his hand on Pei Qian’s head, making her sway from side to side. “Once I leave Ruined Mountain, you can go find that Zhou sister at Belt Peak and invite her to visit Ruined Mountain. But if she asks you to help visit the Longquan Sword Sect or something, don’t agree. Just say you’re a little child and can’t make decisions. As for your own mountain, you can go whenever you like. If there’s something you’re unsure about, just ask Zhu Lian.”

Pei Qian exclaimed, “Don’t worry, Master! I’m very careful these days. The business at the New Year’s Shop has earned me more than ten taels of silver this month! Fourteen taels and three coins! How many baskets of snow-white buns could I buy in the Nanyuan Kingdom with that? Right? Master, let me tell you something else. I earned so much money because I was worried that Sister Shi Rou might get greedy. So I discussed with her that we could secretly hide this money, just between us girls. I didn’t expect Sister Shi Rou to say she’d think about it. After thinking for so many days, I was almost dying of anxiety! Just two days before you came back, she finally said, ‘Forget it.’ Phew, thankfully she didn’t agree; otherwise, I would have had to unleash a set of frantic sword techniques on her. But considering she still has a bit of conscience, I took it upon myself to buy a bronze mirror for her, hoping that Sister Shi Rou wouldn’t forget her roots and mirror herself more often! Haha, Master, just think about it—when she looks in the mirror, she sees an old man who isn’t Sister Shi Rou!”

Pei Qian flitted around Chen Ping’an like a little sparrow, chattering incessantly.

Chen Ping’an rubbed his forehead, not wanting to speak.

He really didn’t know who was teasing whom in this New Year’s Shop; it seemed like neither was taking advantage of the other.

“Why doesn’t Master invite Zhou Qiong Lin himself? It should be a great honor for her to get a personal invitation from me, the first disciple of the founding master!”

“I merely recognize her good deeds hidden from the world, not her imprecise dealings in relationships. So I can’t appear publicly. Otherwise, in Longquan County, if she visits Ruined Mountain, it might be misconstrued that all mountains are like ours. With her way of doing things, she may thrive at the Qingmei Temple, but here, she will inevitably face obstacles. Immortal cultivators who can buy mountain peaks here won’t consider the Qingmei Temple in Nantang Lake. In the end, won’t it just be us who caused her trouble?”

“Master, you go round and round, but I’m earnest and like to think deeply about things, and now I have a headache.”

“Then don’t think about it; just listen.”

“But if I don’t know it’s malicious intent, yet it truly is, and I end up doing something wrong, what then?”

“I’ll be here.”

Upon reaching Ruined Mountain, Zheng Dafeng was still busy supervising the work and didn’t care much for Chen Ping’an, the mountain master.

Inside Zhu Lian’s residence, the walls were already covered with paintings, all depicting beautiful women.

They were all female deities from the North Mountain region, vividly lifelike, each hairstyle more elaborate than the last, exceeding ten styles.

After a long pause, Chen Ping’an finally asked, “Didn’t Cen Yuanji tell you you’re too old for this?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “The little girl only praised this old servant for being a masterful painter.”

At that moment, Chen Ping’an, donning a straw hat, was left speechless.

The three of them headed to the bamboo loft together.

Zhu Lian asked, “Young Master is leaving just like that?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “The intercontinental ferry will arrive at Bullhorn Mountain in a few days.”

The stooped Zhu Lian rubbed his chin, smiling silently.

Chen Ping’an puzzled, “What do you mean? Speak plainly.”

Zhu Lian scratched his head, “Nothing, just thought of the partridge calls echoing through this great mountain. At a time of parting, it evokes some emotions.”

Chen Ping’an was left bewildered.

Zhu Lian said he was going to check on Cen Yuanji’s martial training and left.

Chen Ping’an, upon reaching the bamboo loft, didn’t rush to climb the stairs. Instead, he sat on a stone bench by the cliff. Pei Qian quickly returned with a little girl in a pink skirt, now named Chen Chujian, running toward him.

Chen Ping’an effortlessly reached out, taking a seed from his pocket.

Chen Chujian, the avatar of the Wenyun Fire Python, had read extensively, so Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but ask, “Are there any ancient poems or literary references regarding partridges?”

Chen Chujian immediately stopped munching on sunflower seeds, sitting properly before reciting a long passage about partridges in poetry, speaking eloquently while Pei Qian dozed off, hastily munching on more sunflower seeds to stay awake.

Chen Ping’an felt he hadn’t truly grasped Zhu Lian’s underlying meaning, mostly similar to the themes of hearing partridges deep in the mountains and expressing the sorrow of parting. He was too lazy to think further; he had to climb the stairs soon and should be more concerned about himself.

The little girl suddenly laughed, “And there’s another line: ‘The stream rushes and the peaks are steep, brother cannot proceed!’”

Pei Qian’s eyes lit up, “Oh, the old cook is talking about Sister Xiu Xiu.”

Chen Ping’an set down the remaining sunflower seeds in his hand, silently getting up and heading to the second floor, ready for a good punch.
